{"text":"The food is great, service is professional and and fast! They also open late so it's great for Vegas! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Even though the atmosphere is more like \"club sushi\" I still like this place.
I can put up with the big screen playing trendy music videos and the elevated volume for 3 reasons.

1. The fish was fresh, the rice was good and the selection of fresh fish sufficient!

2. They are open until 6am and I have another option for late night/early morning sushi cravings.

3. Great service!"}
{"text":"Kaizen isn't cheap.  It's not sushi genius or the best thing you've ever eaten.  It's just really good fresh fish served till the wee hours of the morning so in my book thats pretty sweet.  

When I first moved to town from New York and had no car.   I lived in the ghetto area just north and would walk the 15 minutes in blistering heat for the sushi.  Well that and check out the boobs across the street at the hard cock.

Worked for me."}
{"text":"Late night fun with buy one get one free sake. Sushi is good fun place to be plus it's open late so that's a real plus"}
{"text":"So far I love the decor and this trendy atmosphere. Very nice with a modern texture. Can't wait to dig into my 2 sushi rolls. They look delicious"}
{"text":"Wow, am I glad I stopped by. Very nice atmosphere. Very friendly staff. I really like that the rolls I had had more of the ingredients than the rice. I don't like it when the rice over powers the rolls. I had the Kiss of fire and it was great. I will be coming back time and time again to go down the list of their special rolls."}
{"text":"The spring roll is surprisingly good! As well as the Las Nevada roll! The spicy tuna salad is fresh though the sauce isn't that spicy. We came from watching a show and found this open just in time for Happy Hour! The ambience is calm and the interior is pretty. The best part is that it's just across Hard Rock Hotel where we stayed!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of the place. We were greeted and serviced as soon we walked in."}
{"text":"perfect! food is great! good service with nice waiters. weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeereeeeeeee"}
{"text":"Great happy hour: buy 1 get 1 free drinks. Sushi is fresh, and chicken katsu tempura roll is delicious. And it's open 24 hrs!"}
{"text":"Decor was nice, sushi rice needs to be better, it was was a bit hard and needs a bit more sushi vinegar taste. Our side rice dish was also a bit dry."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi bar.  Very creative rolls, great atmosphere and acceptable service."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at all the good reviews this place is getting. We could hardly eat our sushi and had to return it to the chefs! Its nice that this place is open late but thats about it. The food was priced high so I was expecting incredible sushi. Turns out, the sushi you get from Costco or the buffetts at any LV strip hotel tastes way better. I was so disappointed at the quality and will definitely never dine here again. 

Here's a sampling of what we ordered:
CA roll - super dry
Tuna roll & various sashimis - the fish wasn't fresh
Chicken Teriyaki bowl - chicken was dry and inedible
Tamago roll - this one we sent back because it tasted funny"}
{"text":"Very peaceful and possitive atmosphere,  This is are second time here, living in California. Every time we come to Las Vegas we just have to stop here. The sushi was fresh. My fianc√©e loves this place. Great service are waiter was very attentive and helpful both times that we've been here. The rolls are amazing. The parking situation could be a little hectic."}
{"text":"Nice lunch bento set and teriyaki bowl. The grill Saba fish is a must try! Nice, cosy and attentive staffs!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and many varieties of sushi and other items. Service is excellent always greeted as soon as you enter the door and a nice place to go late night."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Agadeshi tofu and fusion sushi rolls very good.  The atmosphere is great with nice music.  Everything that we ordered tasted great.  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I can't begin to explain how amazing this sushi bar is, To Start Our Dinner We Had The Miso Soup Very Delicious, Also The Monster Roll With The Spicy Tuna So Delicious Next To The Soft Shell Crab So Rich In Flavor But The Main Dish I Tried For The First Time Was TORO! oh let me tell you how fresh it was and the way it just melt in every bite was something else! I love this place! And the nice staff is a 5 star experience  definitely the place to eat and sake"}
{"text":"Great sushi place! I am hooked and it's right next to campus. I will definitely be back for more and I plan to bring many of my friends. This was a great choice for dinner"}
{"text":"Must try their sexy roll. It will make you sexy. Also, their dragon roll is much better than any other dragon roll I had before. Super Fresh !!!!!!!!!! Need to order both sexy and dragon roll. It will make your day."}
{"text":"This place suck, everything I order taste fishy!!!!, they are over price! Server was impatient to answer question about their menu! These people did not care about me!
We Will not return!! Ever!"}
{"text":"While in town for a work convention my partner and I stopped by for dinner. We were on a budget due to being on work time. Fortunately we both had a decent amount of food for about $50. 
The sushi itself was a bit pricey; $8 for an order of salmon sushi. However, their cut rolls were the right price for the money. I had two full sized cut rolls for about 25. Not only was the price right, the chow was DAMN tasty. One roll had a house sauce made of a spicy mayo mix. YUM!!!
The one down fall was the sake. I didn't notice a house sake and the cheapest bottle was $10. Now please keep in mind I'm only criticizing this because I'm on the work budget. $10 for a bottle of good sake is very reasonable. I definitely recommend this place for the location; right off the strip; the price, the menu and the quality of the chow. DO IT!!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the world!!!!! Now my favorite and it makes you happy because it's so cool inside! EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent place... rolls have way too much rice. I mean jeez the rolls were huge! Needed a knife to cut them in half. Flavor was good though. Service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"Good sushi spot close to the strip but not directly on the strip. Prices are much better than on the strip. Very cute decor and clean. We came on a Thursday night and it was not busy. We were seated immediately and got our food quickly. We ordered miso soup, edamame, teriyaki bowl and two tempura rolls. The food was fresh and tasted great. We will come here again the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The sushi here was horrible! We ordered two rolls, the dragon roll and California roll.... Both were so small! It's not worth your money."}
{"text":"This place has roaches crawling on the bar and into the food prep area! Who knows what else they have crawling around into the food prep area and pay no attention to. 
We picked this sushi location based upon the positive reviews. It was a cute location and appeared to be clean. We sat at the bar and once our food was served there was a roach crawling on the counter that ventured into the food prep side. The guys who make the sushi saw this and made no attempt to find the roach. They went back into the kitchen and started laughing and came out after laughing and acted like nothing was wrong. We were so disgusted that we had to leave. Never going back again. Obviously food cleanliness is not a priority for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome late night sushi place ! Very attentive servers ! Sushi taste so fresh as well.. Both kaizen locations are awesome !"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to Kaizen, the first being a few months ago while visiting Vegas. Both times, we were able to get seated right away, the service was really good and the food even better! This time we sat at the bar and the sushi chef was very friendly and helpful picking some popular items. I'm pretty sure after each bite I said \"ridiculous\" to my boyfriend. Ridiculous = ridiculously delicious. It wasn't inexpensive, but the rolls are really big and everything tasted fresh and unique. The flavors and sauces were so good that I didn't use soy sauce or wasabi for any of it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The ambience was great! The layout of the restaurant has wood polished tables and benches in the middle while the back wall has booths and the front has a long sushi bar. I went with my son and wife. We ordered Unagi, sashimi appetizers, pork ribs, and Kaizen roll. The food was fresh and prepared well. The ribs took longer to cook then we expected. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"When I am in Vegas for business I will usually make sure I check out Kaizen. I have brought co-workers as well as my wife here a few times and no one was ever disappointed. The prices are not as bad as on the strip, but a little higher than off the strip. The sushi menu is very extensive with items you will not find at other sushi restaurants. There are a few all you can eat places in Vegas, which Kaizen Fushion Roll and Sushi is NOT. Overall, I always enjoy coming here and it is easy to find as it is in a plaza across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. They have a few TV's with sports on them usually, and play modern music. The Atmosphere is very modern and clean. I would recommend this place to someone looking for Fusion Sushi."}
{"text":"Place is clean and somewhat quiet.  The service was prompt.  Food did not disappoint.  Prices on the high side for the ambiance, location and the food itself, which is tasty, but not comparable to an equivalent sushi place on either coast of the US for the same price."}
{"text":"Always good food and good service. Love the lobster tempura roll. The miso soup is delicious too."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. My favorite was the Hawaiian but I also loved the tuna tataki roll and Mexican fiesta roll. I would definitely come back if I am in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Lots of selections and everything is good! Shogun roll and dragon roll are so delicious!! The atmosphere the the place is decorated really nice. Price is very reasonable for good sushi! Love the music too. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Hmm I love sushi so always willing to try a new sushi place. On a friend's recent birthday we decided to stop here after enjoying Yelp's happy hour at Rumor. Perhaps it was a big mistake to come to sushi hungry after indulging in quite a few drinks. Let's just say it would have been beneficial for us and our pocket books to do AYCE elsewhere. Between 3 of us, we graciously cashed out at $100 on sushi on individual rolls not AYCE. Well it wouldn't have been that bad, however, when most AYCE places are around $24 a person, it would have been cheaper to go elsewhere! The rolls were enjoyable but not mouthgasmic and overpriced. I do give them credit for surprising the birthday girl with a tempura green tea dessert, which we enjoyed greatly. I'll stick to my sushi joints off the strip."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been here a few times already and haven't been disappointed.. They have a variety of sushi rolls for everyone and it's worth every penny.. Taking another trip here with my girls the next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food is good! Ingredient fresh and the rolls are innovative . Out me first tune coming here , friend different rolls and is definitely it something you can find in a regular Japanese food restaurants. Location is convenient with ample of parking . Spacious seating And the services are attentive ."}
{"text":"Good quality and creative interpretations.  Ambiance was good for a social gathering on a Monday night, but not too loud. The limited beer and saki selection was the only gripe I had, but by no means a show stopper."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi bar. Had just checked into Hard Rocky Hotel across the street and was very Hungry. Kaizen filled the bill. We had rolls and regular sushi. Everything was delicious and service was outstanding. We sat at the bar. Also, house sake was delicious."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant, just behind the Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise.  

I live here in Vegas, and like most other locals, I hardly ever eat on the strip.  I will usually only go to the strip to eat at Joes Stone Crab in the Forum Shops.  It's great to find nice restaurants like Kaizen to eat at when you're in the area.

The prices are not half as bad as Sushi places on the strip and the quality is excellent!  

My servers name was Sumi, probably misspelled.  It was the best service I've ever had in any kind of Japanese restaurant, I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I love how this place is open late, the ambience is great and ALL their rolls are good! They have a banana roll which was surprisingly pleasant"}
{"text":"By simply crossing Paradise Road, I'm pretty sure we ate two or three times the amount of sushi we would have received for the same price in the Hard Rock. 

Service was SUPER fast. That probably contributed to why we kept ordering roll after roll... we arrived hungry, and the food emerged as each dish was ready, seemingly two beats after we'd spoken the words. Delicious spicy hamachi, tuna sashimi in garlic ponzu, rainbow roll, unagi, various maki of salmon persuasions, I could go on... The vegetarian among us was also pleased with her rolls. I was quite impressed with the freshness of the fish (a feat of modernity I've never gotten over since inhabiting landlocked states).  

Even after several add-ons to our orders, sake for the table, and mango mochi, the total bill was still impressively moderate. Unless your heart is set on Nobu, give Kaizen a try. Just be careful of those speed-demons tearing across Paradise."}
{"text":"I had friends in town and wanted to find a local sushi place. Walking inside to a very clean decor relived the stress of a sub par sushi restaurant hole in the wall.  At first glance I was impressed! The service was good with very attentive servers. The sushi selection is above average and the sake was good! I would definitely revisit for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch before leaving Vegas. The service was pretty fast and friendly. We ordered the miso soup, spicy tataki, salsa dancing roll, beef tataki, and the poke appetizer. All were pretty good, especially the poke."}
{"text":"The decor inside was very nice. When you stepped inside, everyone welcomed you even the chefs. You can hear music  playing along with the music video displaying on one of their walls. 

The waiter did not sat us down. He just went off and lay down the menus without even a heads up that it was our table. Seems like he really wanted us to leave, since he came by every minute to ask if we were ready. When we were finally ready to order, the waiter was glancing out the door and was waiting for other customers, which was so rude. One of the workers had to personally go up to the waiter and tell him that we wanted to order. Never experience this kind of situation in my life but it is what it is. 

The food tasted great. If you order stuff that is not in the menu book, the portion is quite big. The busser would always come by and refill our drinks, which was very nice of him. 

When more customers come in, the waiter paid even less attention to us. One of us had to stand up and get him so we can have the same attention as others.

Overall I like their food, but seriously the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Always ALWAYS the best! Kiss of Fire, Orange Blossom, Avocado Train.... and everything else.... just ridiculously awesome!"}
{"text":"My bf and I were staying at the Hard Rock and we walked across the street to get lunch and saw this place and since we are hard core sushi lovers we gave it a try. Their menu is pretty big, they have a lot to choose from..My fav was the Las Vegas roll. I say if you are staying at Hard Rock and are in the mood for some good sushi go there.. prices are okay not too bad (compared to the bay area) lol..."}
{"text":"Good food and music with friendly staff. Fun environment no issues.  Loved the miso soup and tempura with the salmon rolls! The decor is awesome."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but this is the best sushi that I've had in years.  Try one of the restaurant's special rolls."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best sushi spots in Vegas!!!  When this place is packed or just has a few people scattered through the restaurant, the service is always the same......efficient and  amazing!  I've never had to wait more than a minute before someone comes up to greet me which is a rare thing these days.  The sushi rolls are unique, beautiful, and all have such diverse tastes.   When I have gone there by myself the sushi chefs are great at making you feel welcome and are very interactive, they are the same when I have gone with someone as well but are great for the lone ranger who's out looking for a great dining experience. I highly recommend this place for any local or if you are visiting, it will become you new fav sushi spot or at least be added to your list for sure!  LOVE ME SOME KAIZEN!  Keep up the great work you guys!"}
{"text":"Come to Kaizen when you're in Vegas or you're missing out! Great atmosphere and friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"We went to Kaizen because we got a recommendation from a local! So so glad we went. We got a sashimi platter and some nigiri and the fish was so fresh. We also got a few rolls. I believe one was the orange blossom. The sushi chef was awesome and he made us two rolls by our request.  We had a blast and did some saki bombs as well. This place is priced reasonably for Vegas and has awesome service. We will definitely go back when we are in Vegas again."}
{"text":"I had the chicken katsu bowl for lunch, it was great, portion size was big, tasted great. We ordered a ton of sushi and it was amazing. I recommend the sexy maguro roll."}
{"text":"I am blown away at how awesome they deliver with good food. The avocado train is amazing with the softshell crab the rainbow roll sexy roll, if you love sushi this is heaven on a plate!!"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat, amazing Sak√©, have never tried a roll I didn't like ! Service is fast and friendly and location isn't too far into the strip but still great view of hard rock and other casinos"}
{"text":"We ALWAYS come to this sushi place when we are in Vegas.  NEVER a disappointment.  Service is great and they will fabricate any type of roll you want, just tell them what your tummy desires.  =)"}
{"text":"We called last minute for a table of 20 and they graciously accommodated us.  Not only was the food phenomenal, the service was even better!  Definitely will be coming back when in town."}
{"text":"The Rose roll is something else.  Seriously.

I went here with my cousin because he raved about the place for a long while, claiming it was the best sushi he's ever had.  Since he's from the West Coast and I'm a Midwesterner, I decided I had to see about this for myself.  Not sure if it was the saki bomb or the sushi itself, but damn, it was good.  A little on the pricey side for what you get, hence the 1 star reduction.  I guess that's in comparison to the sushi prices I'm used to in places that aren't Vegas, so it's probably good for Vegas prices.  But I'll definitely be back if I ever find myself in Vegas again, as unlikely as that is."}
{"text":"The freshest sashimi and most amazing sushi creations I have had in the US! I highly recommend coming here if you live in, or are visiting Vegas.  If you like Uni, they have the best!"}
{"text":"I go here on every trip to Vegas. Every roll I have tried has been fantastic. Not the most fancy looking for the outside (strip mall) but inside is very hip and service is excellent. Ninja roll, unicorn roll and mango and lobster roll are a few of my favorites!"}
{"text":"this is one of our favorite dinner hangout spots in vegas!!!

great hours, great location, great atmosphere, great service, great food/sushi! 

tons of sushi options and if you want something that isn't on the menu-- the chefs are great and will make whatever you want!

 can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have been coming here for years, I am a sashimi girl and they have a great sashimi selection. I also like that they are open late. Also the new dessert menu is awesome."}
{"text":"I'm based in LA and have become a sushi snob.  I was in Vegas and craving sushi and thought I would take a chance at Kaizen b/c a local recommended the place to me.  My skepticism quickly disappeared - this place is amazing!!!  I continue to yearn for their seared ono - I have yet to find another restaurant who makes it as perfectly as they do.  

This place is perfect for a date or a big group.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Urban warehouse ambience. Great selection of rolls, bowls, and plates. Tokyo roll had lots of fresh fish. Large variety of full types."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! i'm always satisfied to find pretty good sushi for good prices, so that i found here ridiculously yummy, beautifully prepared sushi for very reasonable prices, i was totally stoked. 

whatever you do, order the Avocado Train, i think it's called - it will break your heart. the yellowtail with jalapeno is perfection, and the grilled ika is scrumptious!! 

i'll be back every time i visit vegas ..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this sushi spot!!!  I went here with my girlfriends at midnight on a Sunday night.  The sushi is very fresh and tasty.  I ordered the Salmon Tempura Roll and loved it.  I tried little bites from all my friends' food and it was soooo good. I love how they played music videos! Perfect way to get pumped for a night out.  We walked across the street to party at Hard Rock.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I order to go all the time. It's consistently good which is hard to do with sushi. The garlic skewers are even better"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in town. I love the decor of the restaurant and the staff is always wonderful!
I sushi chefs are great and the sushi always taste fresh. They play great music and the vibe is definitely pleasant. My favorite roll is the rainbow roll... you must try :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my FAVORITE Sushi spots here in Vegas!! The very 1st day I flew into Vegas, my roommate Jef brought me to the Kaizen in Henderson and I automatically fell in love!

Kaizen is a very great sushi spot especially for one of the best HAPPY HOUR spots to go to after 12am-4am when your hungry and drunk! Can't beat a buy1get1 for Beer and Sake and $2 Hand Rolls!!

Workers: Very friendly staff and theyre always down to drink with you especially the chefs!! They always make sure you have a great time!

Menu: Its SUSHI!! Its a bit pricey but its worth! Try it and let me know! \"First Kiss Roll\" is my favorite Special Roll on that menu.. Pretty much everything on the menu is a great pick and I always bring all my out of towners to this spot and they always ask me to take them back again!

Location: Right across of Hard Rock Hotel and down the street from the Macarran Airport! Cant ask for any better. Better than it being off the strip than on the strip or in a high end Casino!

Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Nope, not buying it... Non japanese sushi joint with large screen tv playing hip hop music video... Why???? Nice interior though. I usually don't like to give negative reviews... but this wasn't my place (sorry)."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm eating sushi at Kaizen Fusion.  I'm a sushi lover and have tried many Sushi restaurants in LA where I live but this place really rocks. Awesome food at reasonable prices and great friendly service. A+"}
{"text":"sushi is a little expensive but I order the teriaki bowl for 10 bucks, and every roll is pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"Good price for the amount of sushi given. We really enjoyed their fried avocado! We are from out of town and when we come back we will make sure to stop here!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food and our awesome server, Joon! Came here for late night sushi and he offered excellent knowledge of the rolls and sake. The quality of the food matches the price. Best non ayce place I've had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out.  The sushi is awesome.  Would definitely recommend the scallop volcano sushi. The waitresses are very friendly."}
{"text":"Great little gem open late! I preferred the sushi here than at the upscale expensive Nobu. Fish tastes Fresh and they have an amazing variety."}
{"text":"Yoooooooo this place is the bomb! Im a big fan of AYCE which they offer here, which is awesome!

 Let me be completely up front and honest here, I've been seeing 1 sushi restaurant for years(which will remain unnamed), rarely straying from the exclusivity of our unity. 

The story goes Kaizen is right down the street from my girlfriends house. Naturally I was a little hesitant to go here, what would my other sushi house think? Would they find out? Would they be mad at me, jealous?! I was a complete mess and stressed out about the situation. Non the less I still went.
I nervously ordered the AYCE, immediately putting in an order for a few rolls, then I waited. Within no time my rolls started to be quickly delivered to me. After taking the first bite of the First Kiss roll all my nerves melted away and I was suddenly in a sushi heaven. I'll never forget that first delicious tempura roll from Kaizen, the First Kiss was very much a First kiss from Kaizen to my taste buds.

The Nigiri was so satifying and delicious it may have been made by God himself. Seriously I think God took the form of a sushi chef and made sushi at Kaizen that day. Everything was so delicious, amazing service, friendly staff, and I'm pretty sure god works there on occasion when he's board which happened to be the day I went. 

What are you waiting for?! Go to Kaizen now! The main thing I learned from all of this is that there is room in my life for two sushi houses. I will be back to see you soon my sweet sweet Kaizen."}
{"text":"Their food was great! We had the salmon skin salad. Ate the whole thing. We also order their rolls. Very good too. You will not be disappointed! We are from SF Bay Area. Next time we visit Vegas, this will be our must go Japanese restaurant !"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to any family because they have good food like the udon noodle. It has good service and they are very nice people."}
{"text":"Went after work late to get some sushi to go and some sides!!! The SERVICE WAS AMAZING, it took them just a few minutes to put my order together, the server was so polite and friendly, the food just amazing . I was in and out of there in less than 12 minutes and had 6 different things I ordered . So impressed !"}
{"text":"If you're looking for sushi after hours...Kaizen is the place! Good service, clean & the BOMB sushi!! Thanks to the taxi man that took us here, if it wasn't for him I wouldn't of found this place. :)"}
{"text":"This place is a must anytime you visit Vegas unless your lucky enough to live nearby. I would buy a second home here just to be close to this place. The rolls and service is amazing!!"}
{"text":"The first kiss roll is one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had in my life. The spicy tuna crispy rice is really good too"}
{"text":"Lunch at Kaizen?  Heck yeah.  Why does eating sushi on your lunch hour feel so scandalous?  Probably because spending $35 for two people is a little much for lunch hour. lol  It could be worse.

I got the lunch special California Roll with salad and miso soup.  Pretty good.  California Roll was really small but Im not really expecting much for it being the lunch special.  My friend got some sort of dragon roll and sashimi.  Her roll was much bigger than my baby Cal roll.  Both she said was pretty good.

My one gripe for this place is that they don't serve white meat chicken!  I love myself a teriyaki chicken but not with gross dark meat.  I understood back in the day the cheap way to go for these places is the dark meat, but now in a health cautious world a place such as this should have white meat for Gods sake. 

Anyways, food pretty good.  Service good...they guy actually remembered I needed a fork for my salad. hehe  The place is always empty for the most part.  I sometimes wonder why being that its across the street from the Hard Rock.  So yeah just an \"okay three star review\" because of the \"no white meat\".  Get with the times Kaizen!"}
{"text":"Best late night Sushi in Las Vegas.  Great service every time.  I recommend the rattle snake roll."}
{"text":"I like Kaizen. It's hip, easy to go with a group of friends and they have some interesting rolls to choose from. 
My only issue is that it's a bit pricey for me. Two rolls and a drink - your check is about $40 before gratuity. I'd rather go to an all you can eat sushi restaurant for half that price and pig out! But this place is open super late (4AM) which is a plus for us industry folks who crave sushi right after partying at the club. HEYYY!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place, but they do not have ayce.  It's also great that they open until 6AM on weekend.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  I go here one a week and staff know us as I walk in.  Sushi are always fresh.  I try some dishes from the kitchen and it's all good too.  You Can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu."}
{"text":"Don't bother going here. The workers were rude and unprofessional, the miso soup was old, and the sushi was too fishy and just off. There's too many better places to eat then here."}
{"text":"I recommend the Nevada Roll it was super tasty! I also had the Lobster Tempura Roll, that was just good, not really what I was hoping for. 

BUT THE COSTUMER SERVICE MADE ME WANT TO ROLL SOMEBODY OVER WITH MY CAR! It was Horrible! I sat down at the bar and waited at least 10mins before the sushi chef asked if anyone has even took care of me. I ordered my rolls with him, only for him to delivery the order to a staff member. Even then nobody asked if I needed anything to drink, then the sushi chef had to remind someone to help me. They took forever to clear my area of plates and took forever to give me the check and come to pick it up! I am very unhappy with the Customer service here. 

But the pineapple saketini were great"}
{"text":"I really enjoy a sushi fix when in Vegas.  In addition to my standard fare of gyoza and edamame, I have tried a couple different rolls and haven't been disappointed. I haven't eaten in the restaurant, but take-out is quick and the food is packaged for travel well. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent food & good service. The men are Japanese (not Korean) & make delicious rolls without packing it with rice. The flavor is balanced and the rice amount is just right. All the raw fish taste well cleaned and fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Pokie bowl was great! Great service, would recommend to anyone that visits Vegas!! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"I've been three visits now.  Super great place.   Food is fantastic.  Ambiance is nice and service great.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I come to this place at least twice a month on late Saturday night because it opens until 6 A.M. on weekends. This place is not AYCE but that's because they offer high quality sushi. I like to get the Unagi Bowl and Miso Soup if I'm trying to get something quick to eat. The presentation of the Unagi Bowl is great and it taste absolutely delicious. My favorite roll here is the Rattle Snake Roll and I get it every time I go. I recommend the Salmon Skin Hand Roll or the Philadelphia Hand Roll, bare in mind that their hand rolls are pretty large! They also offer extremely fresh nigiri and they always have a special fresh fish for the day so be sure to ask! When they have special fishes for the day, they are indeed special because I cannot find some of these fishes at any other sushi restaurants. The Hamachi Kama is also a must, it's perfectly seasoned and grilled and it practically melts in your mouth. They are getting ready for a new location at the Linq so they have been training new waiters so be patient if you get one of the new ones! The sushi chefs are also amazing and have fun personalities if you're sitting at the bar. They like to drink, dance and sing while making sushi! Note, this place is a bit pricy because of the quality but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place is so good! The quality is fantastic and there is So much variety!  There is something for everyone. Keep in mind it's near the strip so it is a bit pricey,  but most good sushi is and this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Sushi roll are very tasty, sashimi are fresh. Our favourite dishes are: Kaizen Roll, and spicy tuna salad. So good! My parents love this place!"}
{"text":"I was in town last weekend with friends celebrating my birthday (seriously, I'm still waiting on your presents...). I wanted to grab sushi, and not being a Vegas regular, knew I should check out Yelp to see where all you Vegas Yelpers are going.

Our party of 4 got in relatively early for dinner, about 5:00 on a Sunday, and we were the only ones there. We ordered about 10 different rolls, and they were served at a well staggered interval. I'd say 8 out of 10 were delicious, the other 2 average. The tuna, salmon, crab and more were all delish and fresh. We stayed for a few hours, I think we left after 8:00 since we were eating, drinking and having a great time. The wait staff were great, and were in no rush to get us out the door. In fact, they made sure to tell us they were open until 4 AM...so I guess we could've stayed for a while!

Ambiance was interesting. I dig the hip hop music and videos, and even though the place looks a little low budget inside, the food more than makes up for lack of decor. 

Price was super reasonable, we ended up spending about $50 each, but that's with drinks, all of those rolls and a 25% tip. Great value. I will definitely visit this place again next time I'm in Las Vegas. Thanks Yelpers, for helping out a San Diegan in your fine city."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi here in Las Vegas! I'm not sure I have had anything I didn't like! And the one on Eastern has happy hour specials!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi place I've ever been to!!!! Although it is expensive I think you get what you pay for. I would recommend going with at least 3 or 4 people so you can try a bunch of rolls. The place is always busy which is good and they are open realllly late. My favorite roll is the jalapeno popper. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and enjoy one of the best sushi restaurants in vegas. I always make it a point to eat here at least once every trip. One of the best things about this place is that it's open so late. It is never too late for a snow-corn roll (my fav) or the always-great rainbow roll. 
Also, the decor is pretty nice, as is the music. they have a live dj there and the service is always great."}
{"text":"As a local, I usually stick to what I know, especially when it comes to sushi..my boyfriend and I found this place during our \"staycation\"..we have come back again and again. The prices are great, hip vibe, excellent sushi menu. We have never ordered the same thing and are very pleased with our yummy choices!! This is our new \"go to\" place when I don't want to cook :)"}
{"text":"Really fast and incredibly fresh. Lots of options to choose from. I'll go again. The staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Fun little sushi spot open late with a casual vibe.  I ordered salmon sashimi and the spicy tuna salad.  Both were delicious. My friend ordered a roll (maybe hardrock roll?) that had lots of fish and no rice which was also tasty.  My complaint is that the prices are too high for a casual sushi spot.  I would come here a lot more if they were more reasonable or if they had a better happy hour.  There are so many great sushi spots in town with better deals unless it's really late i'll probably go elsewhere.  The happy hour starts around midnight and is only 1/2 off on booze and not much discount on any food other than certain hand rolls."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Sushi is yummy and affordable!
Eaten here like every night while working in vegas."}
{"text":"Best sushi on the west coast.  Fish is always fresh and the Korean BBQ roll is fantastic.  Located across from Hard rock.  This place is a must try. Inexpensive especially compared to the strip and a good staff too. Also they are open until 5am so after a late night of drinking definitely the place to be."}
{"text":"We come from LA and eat at Kaizen every time we come to LV at least once if not twice!   We are vegetarian and they accommodate us beautifully!   We love the monkey roll, the soba,  the shishito peppers, the veggie  tempura roll, and the jalape√±o tempura roll.   The service is always great and the atmosphere is cool.  We love it! We went last night and will probably go back tonight!  ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great. It was located right across from my hotel (Hard Rock). Everything I ordered was absolutely amazing. The rolls are a good size. The service is great. I loved the BBQ roll."}
{"text":"Walked in and was seated almost immediately by the friendly hostess. The ambience was laid back and relaxed. It was busy but you wouldn't notice it much because the service was quick. The noise level was just right. Music wasn't overbearing and the conversations throughout were at a low level. The seating arrangements have options. You can sit at the bar, separate tables, or picnic style table. We had the tuna hand roll, ceviche, and octopus and cucumber salad. The best hands down was the octopus and cucumber salad. It had the perfect blend of sweet, cool, sea, and spicy. The tuna hand rolls were simple but great. No frills, just tuna and rice; the way it should be. The ceviche was delicious but I wasn't too big a fan of the rice noodles inside. But, it was definitely 5 star ready. I will be returning next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I recommend the avocado train. It has lobster and soft shell crab. Has all my favorite things in sushi rolls in one!"}
{"text":"The best sushi place in Lass Vegas!! The service and food are excellent!! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here and this place is great. Food is amazing and atmosphere is good. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Friends and I decided to come here for some sushi since it was close to our place where we were staying at. Kaizen Fusion Roll and Sushi is located in a little shopping center. Inside they have nice decor with TV's, plenty of tables, a projector screen, and the sushi bar being visible wherever you sit at. The lighting is dim but it had a nice feeling to it. I ordered the KAI and Rainbow roll. Both tasted fresh and it was tasty. I thought the prices of the food was decent. The service was great because you didn't need to ask for a refill and the lady was polite and respectful. If you have a craving for sushi try this place out."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place by far! I enjoy this location and the one in North Las Vegas. Their garlic edamame is definitely my favorite and would recommend it to everyone. I like going to the one in North Las Vegas because the location is more convenient but also because it has all you can eat."}
{"text":"Cool Sushi spot, right across the street from Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas.

I had sushi at this spot after a gig in Vegas at 4:00am in the morning. Place was jumpin' at 4am....lot's of people out eating sushi in the wee-early early morning hours. Kinda pricey...but if you're really craving sushi late night, this is the spot to go to.

Check my pic....this is one of the rolls I had, Bake Lobster Roll...was pretty good."}
{"text":"If you're a tourist looking for sushi this is only 1 of 2 places farily close to the strip. It's open til 4am Sun-Thurs & til 6am on Fri & Sat. They have quite the selection of rolls. However the rolls are a bit smaller than other sushi places I've been to. The food is good though & comes out rather quickly regardless of what the wait staff tells you. The wait staff is a bit slow at times even when it's not peak hours. Try a saketini if you get a chance they taste a bit like sangria. If you're like me & order a Sapporo you expect it to come w/ a beer glass chilled not a Modelo Especial glass. Deduction of points on that fro me. The atmosphere is well lit. You can sit at a booth area or at a table. The tables are picnic style so you could be rubbing elbows w/ neighbors during busier hours. 
If you're a local this place a bit pricier than other sushi restuarants for less of the food. Again great food, just need to eat more to be full. Normally 2 rolls & an app w/ a beer will fill me up. It took 3 rolls & an app w/ a beer to fill me up here. 
Tried 9 rolls last night out of our group:
Shrimp Killer - Good
Spicy Rainbow Roll - VERY GOOD
Teriyaki Roll - Not so good
Silver State Roll - SO GOOD
Dragon Roll - ok
Avacado Roll - ok
Tiger Roll - Good
Firecracker - SO GOOD"}
{"text":"Ok so I am really torn. I came here for my bday party about 2 years ago, and actually had a great time, but came here last night and was really disappointed.

The service was fucking terrible. If you read my other reviews you will see that I am a very forgiving/reasonable person. The host was just plain uninterested and our server could give a shit less. The funny thing is we sat at the bar and the place was not busy. I was blown away, but my friend and I were craving sushi after a couple of drinks, so we decided to go for it.

We ordered a couple of beers and a couple of rolls, which were about 14$ a piece (kinda pricey) but really didnt care because I wanted to let loose. The rolls were really good; in fact we ordered about 5 more between the two of us. 

Ok, so here is the problem.
      1.No interaction from the sushi chefs
      2.The server had a piss poor attitude
      3.I tried multiple times to get recommendations from server and chef with no luck....they just didn't give a shit.

Ive come to a point were i am so sick of incompetent people,uninspired people (hence the reason most of us yelp so we can find no bullshit, highly recommended places to go). Well the unfortunate thing about kaizen is that they have the ability to be great, but the service is just non existent. If this was an instance in which only the sever sucked, I could probably blow it off. But no, this was the whole fucking operation.
    I will never come here again. I have never been so ignored or made to feel so insignificant at a restaurant in my whole life. I will give them 2 stars because the sushi was a sliver above average. Its a shame but the service was unacceptable. Oh and their prices just suck for what you get. Nothing but another glorified \"sushi restaurant\" in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a weekday. Had the spicy salmon and Sunrise rolls. Rice was pretty stale--being that it was lunchtime, I'm assuming this was last night's rice :-/

The taste and the freshness of both were good. I was the only one in here so service was not surprisingly good and fast.

Would've given 4 stars if they had fresh rice."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and we wanted something fast and really good this place did not let me down!!!!!"}
{"text":"My fav place in Vegas. Have to try their sushi. I tried their sexy roll and dragon roll. So bomb . I can't believe. Best roll of my life"}
{"text":"Last meal in Vegas before heading back to LA.
Kaizen was really close to our hotel and on the way to the freeway. 

It wasn't very busy when we got there so we were seated and served right away. We ordered the sashimi lunch combination, the first kiss roll, and the tokyo roll. The server said she accidentally poured two soups instead of one (claiming that the lunch special comes with one soup). She scored brownie points with that move. 

The sashimi combination was alright. The slices of fish were decent. Not the Best sashimi I've ever had but it hit the spot.

The first kiss roll was pretty scrumptious. Not entirely sure what sauce it's served on top of but it was absolutely delightful. 

The Tokyo roll looked scary. I've never seen a raw fish roll look so slimy before. But the server Shima informed us that there was a mustard ponzu dressing on top of it. Me and my boyfriend only ate half of the roll trying to stomach the unusual slime but the waitress insisted that she still discount the roll from the bill.

To make up for the Tokyo roll, our server brought out a deep fried green tea ice cream covered with whipped cream, cherry and drizzles with chocolate sauce. Never having tried this concoction, we were pleasantly surprised with such a treat. Thanks Shima!"}
{"text":"We came in the waiter was very friendly and professional. The seats are very comfortable! We had unicorn roll and chicken yakisoba. It is not our first time to this restaurant. This restaurant has always exceed our expectation!"}
{"text":"\"Unique Rolls... slightly overpriced\"

Unique offering of rolls and specials. Interesting interior, nice staff, easy access but a little overpriced. Try the baked rolls... I was very pleased.

atmosphere: 8
price: 7
food quality: 8
parking: too easy"}
{"text":"Been back to Kaizen like three more times now and they never fail to impress me.  My favorite sushi place in Vegas.  Try the mussels.....they're great."}
{"text":"Really great place for that late night sushi craving, good calm vibe and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Staying at the Hard Rock and was in the mood for sushi. Walked across the street and I am glad I did. Food was amazing,fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Seguimos novamente a indica√ß√£o do Yelp.

Nossa melhor experiencia em Las Vegas em termos de Sushi."}
{"text":"Super good. Have not been diappointed by anything we have had. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wasnt wild about this place. I have 3-4 different sushi dishes and none were great. All were pretty average and forgettable. I was also kinda blown out by the bar bill, so didn't leave me feeling like I will be back. There are many better places in town."}
{"text":"Philadelphia sushi was good. Their BBQ Pork Ribs was very tender! Our server, Mai, was very nice."}
{"text":"I thought I have reviewed this place many times but it's asking me for one again. This place has consistency and large portions and decent prices.  I send everyone I know there!! No complaints ever!!"}
{"text":"In Vegas not really knowing the sushi scene, so I relied on yelpers to give some recommendations.  This is a gem of a place that is solid and creative, about 1 mile off the strip.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are above average.  You'd pay almost twice the amount on the strip.  I'm a huge sushi fan in places all over the country.  Excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to take a lunch break on a hot afternoon. Very quick service and tasty items. Great ambiance as well!"}
{"text":"We went here one night very late.... though it's more expensive than other sushi restaurants we like here in vegas it was delicious. We indulged in a couple bottles of sake and had some of their rolls and sashimi. This place is a classier atmosphere, definitely a good place to bring a date. But as far as pigging out on Sushi... I wouldn't go too hungry unless you want to get a big bill."}
{"text":"Hands down an awesome sushi bar! We were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and saw this place across the street. Boy are we glad we tried it. The menu was a bit overwhelming since it was our first time there. The server was very nice and great service. She made a few suggestions and they were so good! Their prices are typical of sushi places. Anywhere from $10 and up per roll. 

We tried a baked scallop roll that was full of scallops. The don't skimp on their ingredients and I love that. I tired a lobster and crab roll wrapped in halibut...FRESH! We also tried their banana roll. Different because it was slightly sweet and savory. 

I love the fact that there are real Japanese people working there and making sushi. Maybe it makes it feel more authentic. You just feel like you get the whole experience versus a Mexican guy making the sushi for you. Even though he probably has no problems making delicious sushi."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is excellent! Love the decor and the bar situation. I had the beef udon and i loved it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi restaurant when I want better quality sushi than you get at all you can eat. The food is always really well prepared and the chefs do a great job. I've become close with most of the employees and I'd recommend Kaizen to anyone!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Kaizen!?!?!?  It's convenient, consistent, and the food is fresh!  Service is always top notch and although they don't offer AYCE, I still walk out very full for about $25.  The staff is really polite and always on top of their game, even when it's super busy and they are clearly understaffed.  The waiters and waitresses they have know the entire menu and restaurant very well + their regulars.  The best thing about this restaurant is the layout and seating options.  When I dine with friends where we will be talking a ton and want a more private area, the tables on the left offer a nice view of the restaurant without all of the noise and busyness.  When I come alone I either prefer the bar top or the long tables on the main floor area, depending on the mood I am in.  

I love the music here and although it can seem a little bit loud sometimes when the restaurant is full and Lady Gaga is playing over the sound system to add to the noise, it somehow seems fitting to the energy of the servers here.  

I really do wish Kaizen would start doing an AYCE menu at least during certain hours.  Their sushi is really fresh and if they offered AYCE, I would likely get more nigiri than rolls as their nigiri and hand rolls seem quite pricey for being so small."}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the Hard Rock on a trip to Vegas, and considering the fact I was on a limited budget, I was very happy to find good affordable sushi across the street from my hotel!

The sushi there wasn't amazing or anything, but it was good and definitely cheaper than a lot of the alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"I come to this Sushi Resturant every time I want sushi. This is the Best in Las Vegas! Everything I mean EVERYTHING is good. My favorite is the Crazy Girl and the Shrimp Lover. The atmosphere is nice, they play good music, the desserts are awesome! Eve"}
{"text":"sweetest ppl ever and amazing sushi! we eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, but not my favorite. I don't really get the rave reviews. The majority of sushi spots in Vegas are AYCE- and I'm fine going to a place that isn't, but the expectation is that the quality is higher. And while the presentation and service were good, the actual quality of product and freshness of fish seemed average.

When ordering takeout, this spot is great about carefully packing up your order so each roll has it's accompanying sauces alongside- this allows you to control how much is used and prevents the rice from getting soggy on your ride home! 

Menu features a wide range of specialty sushi rolls, and some grilled items and apps as well. Nigiri oddly did not seem to to be that common here. The Kai roll was recommended by staff and the best of what we tried. 

NOTE: Takeout rolls noticeably smaller than what is received dining in."}
{"text":"YUM-o!

my friend & i went here just because we stopped at CVS and was craving sushi. & i tend to be a sushi purist ever since going to Sugarfish in LA but sometimes i want a fatty heap of lobster-crunchy-ricey-mayo- goodness...& hey, I'm vegas! So we go in & mind u, we didnt yelp! it before so we has NO idea what we were getting ourselves into. BUT boy were we pleased. the menu is like a book so good luck choosing one thing. I ended up choosing the Japanese Lasagna, cause well i have never heard of it! and my friend ordered the Silver Plate Roll (for starters we got Monkey Balls and Seaweed salad-- Delish!)... Both dishes were bomb.com but The Japanese Lasagna will rock ur socks off!!! It was soo what i was looking for :)...Sigh, sadly they dont have a place in LA....but I'm sure as hell gonna find a rip-off...or maybe its just a sin city treat? ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Would definitely visit again.  Their rice was not sticky enough for me and fell apart quickly after picking up w chopsticks.  Had their sushi combo w California roll.  Awesome!

And all this for $10.76...great food at bargain prices"}
{"text":"Creative rolls, speedy service!  The only restaurant I HAVE to return to since living in Las Vegas.  And they have amazing hours for the Vegas lifestyle!"}
{"text":"Yum-zo!  I'm typically a purist - chirashi, sashimi, miso - sign me up!  But the inventive rolls here caught my eye.  Photos in the menu don't hurt.  Nice, quick friendly service.  I think they put crack in the ceviche (actually maybe just lime and sugar) but I wanted to eat it (garnish and) all."}
{"text":"My friends and I hit up this place at 4am on Saturday night after some hard partying at Blush. The restaurant is slightly off the strip but it's well-worth the $12 cab ride from the Wynn. 

We had a group of 6 and we were seated right away. Our food came super quickly and everything was really fresh...shocking for 4am! 

I had a cucumber salad that was served in a martini glass (super fun). The clam on top was SO fresh. I also had the crazy boy roll which was delicious as well. 

Very reasonably priced. Our waiter even called two cabs for us after we were done. 

Also a plus: this establishment is non-smoking so it was a breath of fresh air...literally! Will definitely go back next time!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi place ever. It's not close to my house, so I don't go as often as I'd like. But every time I bite into something, I'm like, \"THIS is what it's supposed to taste like.\"The fish is always fresh and buttery. Every roll is perfect. I can't even."}
{"text":"Their sushi was AMAZING! I live here in Vegas didn't even know this place existed. Great food HORRIBLE, RUDE SERVICE which makes me not want to go back.. Whet in a week ago about an hour before closing with a party of 6 our waitress IRENE gave us the worst service from the beginning even though she had an auto gratity already added to our check. Half of us at the table work in the industr and couldn't believe her attitude (rolling her eyes after asking questions in regards to the menu,etc.) I would definitely request a DIFFERENT SERVER if i ever went back.  She ruined our 1st time experience there!"}
{"text":"The best value food I've had in Vegas- minus the taxi ride to get there. It's located way off strip- in a 'strip mall' across the street from Hard Rock Hotel. If you are staying at the Hard Rock, simply walk across the street to try the ridiculously good spicy tuna roll covered in tuna and dripping with roe sauce that they call the \"Sexy Roll\". I also tried the Scallop Volcano- a california roll exploding with tons of cooked mushrooms, scallops and spicy yummy sauce.  There are a lot of unique rolls with chicken or other cooked foods inside.  Sit at the bar and talk to one of the cool Japanese sushi chefs.  Good for large groups coming over from the hotels etc..."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hard rock and was craving some sushi! This place was seriously so good! We came around 9pm on Friday. It wasn't busy at all. Service was quick and fish was really fresh. 

We had the -
Paradise Roll
Poke Mix - combo of ahi and salmon
Salmon sushi
Ahi sushi

You should definitely come here if you are in the area! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place for the afterclub drunken munchies or lunch with the parents! I can't help but always ordering a snow corn roll and a scallop dynamite. This was the place that put \"Vegas Sushi\" on the map for me and distinguished it from sushi restaurants in ANY other city."}
{"text":"Not really a fan. I wanted sushi in Vegas and wound up here.  It was in a questionable strip mall.  The long tables were kind of cool and they played rave music with the concert videos in the background. The sushi wasn't to my liking.  I thought it tasted fishy, like in a not fresh kind of way.  I don't know, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really good either."}
{"text":"Love the late hours and amazing menu! The Rose role and crab salad has it in along with the amazing sake selections"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here often after work and I am always pleased with the food"}
{"text":"I had edamame, miso soup and a  BBQ roll. I'm stuffed. The roll was delicious and so were the appetizers. The Mochi ice cream is sweet. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I love that they are open late, and this is a huge selling point. Decent sushi but very mildly pricey compared to other equal-quality sushi joints (like $2ish more per roll). Consider it a convenience fee for being open late.

Their flavored sake was absolutely incredible. For you people raised in imperial measurements, the 250ml sake is a good quantity for two people who are going to be there for a little bit.

Careful in the parking lot, some folks be crazy due to proximity to the college, the strip, and the roads nearby."}
{"text":"Fun little place with good decor. Sushi is good. BIG variety to choose from. Orange Blossom is my pick. Reasonably priced. Strong on service."}
{"text":"If I could give it 3.5 stars I would! I will start on a positive note, the tuna nigiri melted in my mouth and the service was tag team so never had to ask for any refills. I ordered a few rolls, the ingredients were fresh but it just missed the mark. When you've had exceptional sushi in all parts of the US you know what your looking for. This place may be fun for late night or actually any time if your goal is to lap up the liquids as there was a really rowdy table in the place at 6pm. Lots of colorful loudness while one eats sushi, not my thing!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I was extremely impressed. Very good, large servings. Friendly environment, all around great experience. I will come back soon"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the most interesting sushi bar with the freshest fish in Vegas. Never miss a chance to come here when in town."}
{"text":"Wasn't really in the mood for sushi after a long week in Vegas working a trade show, but my pal saw Kaizen in Yelp, and insisted we go. Quiet at 8ish on a Wed. evening (thankfully; woulda had NO patience for a loud party scene that night). The drinks were great and the food was remarkable--fresh, beautifully presented, unusual combinations--all delish. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas...love this place!!!! The rolls are amazing...cool music/vibe...almost a club scene.  It's understandable why locals come here....
 
Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I love Kaizen!

I'd never been here, but I am always in the area when trolling around for food. Grabbed lunch here the other day for a team lunch at work.

Everything was delicious. The miso soup, the seaweed salad, the various rolls. Try the caterpillar roll, and share it with people. It's foodporn worthy.

Service was fast!

I can't wait to come back.

Sorry this review isn't as novel as my previous ones. I'm close to 400. I don't care. This place is just worth it, and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow I love food and I had the blast here food was amazing the Korean bbq roll was just incredible very recommend I will visit again and soon"}
{"text":"Not as tasty as i like."}
{"text":"This place is right across from Hard Rock in a shopping center.  Super good rolls although normal to slightly higher priced but very good.  Service was pretty good, I would definitely come back again.  The desert menu is awesome I have never seen so many options at a sushi restaurant which was really cool.  I had the chocolate truffle and it was really bomb."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! I highly recommend it. Some of the best sushi we have ever had anywhere and we have had Sushi all over the country. Cheers!"}
{"text":"another one of my great finds! just like firefly. delicious!  if ur in vegas, def plan a pit stop."}
{"text":"Grabbed some rolls on the way home. Great food & service. Can't wait till next visit. Yummy"}
{"text":"Came here late night to eat with the family.
About 5 couples, a family of 4, and 3 people at the bar. Waitress sat us down immediately but after 15 mins no one came to acknowledge that we were even here.
No \"hello I'll be with you shortly\", no \"can I start you guys with some drinks\", NOTHING.
I get that there's only three of you, but why bother sitting down somebody you're not even gonna take care of?
Obviously the visit was already at a bad start and I was not happy, after getting the waitress' attention, the one that sat us down -- she asks \"has anyone helped us?\" LIKE SERIOUSLY?!!!
After 15 mins you FINALLY noticed?!
Food was a hit and miss. 
But honestly it was really hard to enjoy the whole experience with the terrible service provided. A revisit is unfortunately not in the near future.."}
{"text":"Well I guess they read my last review because the nigiri sushi list is now taped inside the front cover of the menu!
Another great meal at a very reasonable price per person. We stuffed ourselves for about $40 each. 
Lots of choices. Nicely divided menu by type of roll - fried, tempura, etc.
Much better value than the high end places in the hotels nearby. 
Open late so you can eat a nice meal after a very long day working."}
{"text":"Love this place! Huge selection! Something everyone will love! Wish I lived closer, I will definitely come here again when I'm in town next!"}
{"text":"Sushi is great! Good quality food. Restaurant is nice and clean. Absolutely loved the Strawberry Mochi!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the worst dining Experiences I've had in a long time.  I was part of a large party.  First they got the orders wrong.  Then their Chicken Katsu was dry and tough as shoe leather.  Then came the bill, which they didn't have correct and couldn't separate successfully.  To add insult to injury after each person telling the cashier what they had (in order to pay correctly) they insisted that they were going to add their automatic gratuity to each bill.  #nevergoingback"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Vegas. Service is always good along with the wide choices of fusion rolls. Money well spent for the quality! Serving size is generous and the variety keeps me coming back to try new items on the menu."}

{"text":"Fantastic and authentic sushi, and good sake selection. Staff is very friendly and helpful.
The menu has all the staples and is also very creative, the Spider Mania roll and Monkey Brain are amazing!"}
{"text":"Kiss of Fire roll was not that great, but the service was prompt. Appreciated the late open hours. There probably are better options in town for sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot! The white rose and Unicon rolls were awesome. The kaizen roll was good too. Everything was really fresh. Good service. Prices were pretty good too. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sushi restaurant! I have eaten at Nobu , Katsuya, and Koi. This place is definitely the same quality of food and service is great! It's my second time here and everytime I come to Vegas from now on I'll definitely be stopping in. I ordered the spicy yellowtail roll and the crunch scallop it was delicious"}
{"text":"I was staying at the nearby Hard Rock Hotel and the dealer overheard my party discussing whether or not to put in a reservation for Nobu that same evening.  She recommended that we come to Kaizen instead, strongly insisting that we could get the same quality sushi for a quarter of the price.  I was sure she was exaggerating, but figured that if her recommendation fell somewhere in between complete hyperbole and the truth it would still be a worthwhile risk.

This was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life, and Kaizen will be on my go to list whenever I'm in Vegas.  They have more \"riceless\" rolls than I have ever seen, each one more delicious than the next - this isn't the typical crab meat stuffed into a cucumber you'll get at most sushi restaurants.  The Scallop Volcano Roll integrated mushrooms in a manner I had never before seen at a sushi restaurant, and I'm not ashamed to add that I was drinking the mushroom broth afterwards like soup - it was simply amazing.

Is the quality better than Nobu?  Of course not.  Is the taste on par?  Yes, definitely.  Add in the 2 for 1 happy hour and this is the best combination of value and taste in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"-got takeout from here late at night

-they specialize in specialty rolls (you know the ones with all sorts of fish and different sauces covering them)

-would come here again if I was staying at hard rock

-parking lot is kind of busy"}
{"text":"Went here 2 weeks ago as Gangnam Asian BBQ had an hour wait at 9pm on a Sunday.  Based on other reviews, looks like they get overflow from Gangnam often.  Food is mediocre, although plentiful.  Service is friendly but we had different wait staffs coming by.  They check on you verbally but they don't seem to notice that your drinks get low! Overall very average, we don't intend to come back."}
{"text":"Their sushi is nothing special and its rather over priced for what you get. The happy hour over at the Henderson location is better for getting drinks before hitting the club (10p-2a). The only thing this place has going for it is that it's open late."}
{"text":"Off the strip and reasonably priced. Friendly wait staff. The saketinis and avocado train are must-haves!! Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Good select of sushi rolls, and they came out pretty quick. Service is good. Restaurant ambiance is higher end, reflecting traditional Japanese with a modern flare."}
{"text":"I am new to sushi and the chef helped guide to some great choices. Very friendly and mellow vibe. I will be back before I head home. Nice happy hour with buy one get one drinks. Girlfriend like the decor."}
{"text":"Very good menu and great service!!!! Don't sleep best sushi in Vegas!!!! Don't sleep on this jewel! Very food happy hour menu as well as regular! Very close to casinos and a lot cheaper! If you want good sushi try this place!"}
{"text":"A-OK sushi place located across the street from Hard Rock. The sushi prices are a little steep but im sure its because of the high rent location. The quality of the sushi was just ok and the decor was boring. The service was a little slow and had to order not from the sushi chef but a hostess/server. Dont think i will be back if i am in the area and want sushi."}
{"text":"We're in Vegas for a volleyball tournament at UNLV and chances upon Kaizen and WOW!! what a find! The salmon nigiri was excellent.  Crispy rice was delicious along with great hand rolls. :) Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Where do i start.. Kaizen Sushi is a Japanese restaurant  in front of the hard rock casino. Or at least it tries to be.. First, it's korean owned (like most sushi places..
In case you didn't know, sushi rolls were invented in korea, not japan), they serve Japanese food, but not traditional Japanese cuisine, if that's what you're looking for (try Ichiza). I came here for sushi, and to my dissapointment, the sushi was not fresh, I've been here twice and both times the fish was old.. From tuna to uni, the sushi was old and dry. Not to mention the size of their cuts.. For the price they charge they should at least make up for quantity. I've had an order of $6 nigiri that filled me up more than their $22 chirashi bowl (mix sushi bowl). Ok maybe not... but you get the idea.. The only reason why they dont deserve a 1 star review is the fact that they have friendly people working there, and they are open later than most sushi places in vegas (they close at 4am).. so prepare to order a couple of Sapporo's and Sake, and hope it makes the food taste better."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for the first time. No wait. ordered our food. our hot sake and beer, appetizer, and one of our entrees came out. Forty minutes later, still no food. We ask our server to check up on it. He never came back. We asked another server and he took care of us. Eventually we got all our food and he gave us 3 more hot sakes on the house, which made it a little better. I was super hungry to begin with, so I was not in a good mood at all and I couldn't enjoy the sushi I ordered because I ate everything so fast. This review is based mainly on poor customer service. Food was average."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi place here Las Vegas. The ambiance is cool and modern contemporary. The servers are friendly and attentive. But most of all, the food is great. Fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! Only a few people when we came at 5:30 on a Wednesday. Service was really fast and the quality of the sushi was good. We got a Rattle Snake, Banana, and Mango Lobster rolls."}
{"text":"Large menu and very accommodating staff. My meal was excellent plus it is bogo after midnight on drinks Sunday- Thursday."}
{"text":"Amazon yellowtail ... amazing everything. This is my second time here. Orange blossom is the go to, but if that is not your thing, everything is fresh and great quality sushi."}
{"text":"This was an enjoyable experience... Sushi was great and they were playing hip hop?!? Like Whoa!!!! I am definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Very clean and modern ambiance. Friendly staff and well priced rolls. They offer a diverse combination of rolls with various seafood and meats, as well as entrees, desserts, and drinks. You can sit at the bar or tables."}
{"text":"I was disappointed when I came in there to eat horrible service I was just sitting there waiting for sombody to take my order or ask me if I need anything and for 25min nobody said anything just looked at me so I got up and walked out in I will never go eat there and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in vegas. Been going here for years! Also be sure to try the avocado train or the scallop volcano roll! Awesome staff!"}
{"text":"Unique menu. Lots of interesting choices. Simple but cool atmosphere. Quick service and a great place to go before a flight. Have been here 3x."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi bar in Vegas! I've been multiple times and the food has never disappointed. The prices are reasonable. The drinks are good. It's right across the street from The Hard Rock. It's easy to find but not overly crowded. A must stop for me!"}
{"text":"Been here before food is ok not the best sushi rolls in town for sure . This time I sat at the bar And sushi chefs were totally out of touch and I practically had to yell at them to get my rolls, but the retarded thing is me and my friend were the only guys at the freaking bar."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good.  They have a large variety of rolls, and they are almost all delicious.  It's a great place for a small group of 4-5, and they stay open really late.  We always go when we visit Vegas.  And for the people who don't like rolls, the entrees such as teriyaki chicken and udon are good as well.  They flavor the veggies and udon very well.  

Our favorites:
Lasgana Roll
Avaocado Ball (kinda pricey but totally worth it)

Skip the shitake mushroom roll."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Las Vegas I tend to stop in here for a  meal.  It's never a disappointment.  Always seems to be so fresh.  It's Amazing to me how the desert seems to get stuff shipped so that it's as fresh.  Theres a nice selection of fish here and if you're into rolls it won't disappoint.  Also a good selection of sake and a few Japanese beers.  But do stay away from the chicken Karaage until they figure out their seasoning which makes the chicken dry as f_ _ _ !   Trust me on that or if not, at least ask if it's dryyyyyy!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. . I am accustomed to being told of sushi bar specials and chef's recommendations.if  you want cheap bad service ..this is then your spot. . DON'T WASTE YOUR  TIME..."}
{"text":"Kaizen is great. 5 Stars and great for late night dining. 
I love the rolls and chicken teriyaki. Big portions."}
{"text":"the sushi was a'ite.. but way way way overpriced.  we've had better at an all you can eat joint.  

it's clean.. and the service is good,  but nothing wowed me or made it stand out... the names of the sushi were clever!  i'd probably never go back.  plus i think it's overpriced.

it was ok."}
{"text":"Take your time and enjoy the experience... Great sake choices too ;D  It's been a while since I had really great quality sushi; thanks to Mel!  All their rolls are done exquisitely and with great detail.  The menu does provide you ample choices so you should listen to your gut and instincts to choose what you should have.  All in all, the service is extremely attentive and prompt.  If you're not getting your food quick enough, it's most likely due to your indecisiveness in selecting what you want from the menu.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would make the effort to wander off the strip to eat here again.  If you're staying at the Hard Rock Casino, it's right across the street in the same complex with CVS.  Enjoy, eat sushi, and please drink some of their wonderful sake too."}
{"text":"So good ! Sushi was perfect had a good waitress everything was prefect l. Will come back and tell my friends"}
{"text":"Average sushi at best.  We ordered yellowtail appetizer, Kai roll, Salmon killer, and Kiss of Fire rolls.  Good but not remarkable.

Service was basic.  Recommendations were not anything more than pointing to a menu.

Even the recommended Chocolate truffle dessert was average."}
{"text":"This place is always a must visit when we land in Vegas! The food is delicious and the service is always fun. The lighting makes sets the mood along with the killer music. No matter if you're with friends, family or that special someone, Kaizen is the perfect spot for great sushi and a good time!"}
{"text":"This is our to go spot while we are in Vegas. It is a very hip place and it is right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel. The food is excellent and the service is good as well. Will we return? Yes, it is our Vegas sushi place."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi !!! Party of 4 and we were greeted at the best. Great attention from servers. Defenetly come back"}
{"text":"I came in around 230p on a Monday so the place was not busy.  Service was good.  The California roll broke too easily but the salmon, tuna and unagi sushi were decent.  Green tea ice cream was good."}
{"text":"I love Kaizen! My girlfriend and I always go here all the time and it's always awesome! The rolls are always great and the decorations and environment is so well done!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst sushi we have EVER eaten.The fish wasn't fresh.it was overpriced and amateur.if you wanna call yourself a sushi restaurant....Learn how to make sushi.And  if you can't afford to keep fresh fish in the house.....don't call yourself sushi chefs.Also.I Ordered the seared beef tataki....It came out ice cold.GROSS food.Save your time and your money.This place should shut the doors before they give someone food poisoning.Word to the wise...they order cheap ahi that is not sushi grade and they use it for sushi.Please bring a roll of toilet paper.Your gonna need it when your colon explodes on your ride home.
Don't eat at this joint.seriously.Unless you have an extra three days to spend running to the bathroom......"}
{"text":"We came late on a Friday evening and were seated immediately. The sushi and sashimi were incredibly fresh tasting and the rolls very tasty with fast and friendly service.  The ambience is contemporary, inviting and romantic. They have a nice selection of desserts. We had the chocolate truffle and it was so delicious. We wanted to lick the plate! They are open until midnight and off the strip with ample parking so easy in and easy out. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday evening for dinner and was greeted well and seated quickly. Not a super busy place during the evening/dinner time which is nice because we needed someplace low-key to eat. Being from the Pacific Northwest, I am picky with seafood and sushi and I was impressed with the sushi here. The tuna was very fresh and the roll was made well. My friend got salmon and it was delicious and fresh. The price is not crazy which is also what attracted us here. Overall great place to have a low-key dinner."}
{"text":"Tried this for something new near UNLV. Delicious!! The Chicken Terriyaki Roll was yummy and the veggie tempura was great."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with friends. Food was good from soup to entree. Service was also good and reasonable. Would definitely come back to this place and grab more sushi and katsu!"}
{"text":"You must try the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna. Very fresh. Also they have a great happy hour on weekdays."}
{"text":"Ambience: Solid A here. The lighting is dim, and makes for an intimate feel. Decor is simple with traditional Japanese and modern touches.

Service: It's an overall B to B-. The hostess and wait staff is friendly and just the right amount of attentive. Sushi chef was cold. I am so used to friendly, outgoing sushi chefs, so while he was by no means rude, his customer facing skills leave something to be desired.

Sushi: And of course the most important aspect of. Sushi restaurant. Unfortunately, this is a C to C+. As a frequent sushi nosher and lover or nigiri, I was more than a little disappointed. What I ordered: salmon, yellowtail belly, uni, and unagi. The unagi was the best of the 4. But honestly, it's pretty touch to mess up since its BBQ'd. Flavor was good, although the unagi sauce was cloyingly sweet. The salmon was second best. Standard. Not bad, but not great. Slightly flavorless. The yellowtail belly and uni were terrible. I was really looking forward to the buttery fattiness, but found it entirely flavorless and stale (the ends were hard which I've never experience with sushi). To be honest , I choked down the uni. Sad because it's one of my favorites to order. It had an odd metallic flavor that again, I've never experienced. Additionally, the nigiri itself was really sloppy. Most all fell apart as soon as I tried to pick them up with my chopsticks.

Wish I could have given it at least 3 stars, but the food quality is obviously a big factor. I've been here a few times, so this isn't based on a one time experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good decor, nice ambiance and looks very clean and hip!  Food is excellent so stop by and get your sushi fix on!  Service is excellent by Ivan!!"}
{"text":"A Very solid sushi experience. Nice variety of rolls and other traditional dishes on the menu. Fast and polite service. Not bad considering it's in Vegas."}
{"text":"I know everyone 'loves' Kaizen, but I've been here a few times (7-8) and I've never really loved it.  The eastern location is better though bc they do have the half price sushi but still.  Their sushi is high priced, and they dont have all you can eat, so you end up spending a fortune.  The few good things I've had were the jalapeno roll, which was actually really good, but I feel this place is more 'americanized' sushi which I hate.  I love authentic food, but this place is just ok.  I hate to give a less than spectacular rating, but I've never had a great meal from here.  If you come here for late night sushi, hit up musashi! Its down the road on paradise and way better! They have happy hour EVERY night from 11pm-3am.  

The service has always been good, but the food is just ok to me."}
{"text":"When it comes to food service and price point I would give Kaizen Fusion Roll five stars as far as customer services goes however they'll come in rolling at a 1 lowly star. So this review will average itself out at 3 stars. 

Here's the situation. My friend and I went driving around looking for a place to eat at around 4a and yelped the nearest location. Boom Kaizen popped up near UNLV. 

The food, for the price is awesome, I got a baked salmon roll. Delicious. Unlike all the other all you can eat places here and original. He got some type of calamari roll and something else. 

Adding an $11 lychee flavored sake and a green tea tempura ice cream (but they don't serve vanilla flavor which didn't really make any sense to me but who am I...) who couldn't be more pleased?

Well... let's start from the beginning. 

The serve here was beyond poor. Upon entrance the two girls that we were working had just the most unengaging attitudes and missed so many marks. I had to ask 3 times for the same 7UP, the miscommunication was so obviously there that the poor service just had to be mentioned.

I mean and I'm not to be a stickler about table courtesies, but all the servers that took our dishes away or served us just stuck their whole bodies right between both my friend and I - based on my memory as a server, aren't you supposed to come around the side or wouldn't that just make more sense? Anyway - it was an odd experience. Given I understand it's 5:30 in the morning at that point everyone wants to go home and they're shoving people out, but the place is still an establishment and the restaurant clearly strategically placed itself across certain hotel&casinos for a reason, but the place was dead on a Saturday night for obvious reasons...

I mean it's obviously not the food, the food is great and decently priced.

Worth it if it's LAST LAST minute late night dinner and you're near the UNLV campus."}
{"text":"WORST customer service ever. I got there one night and paying the bill, I was told my credit card was declined. So I gave another one. The day after I checked my bank account and noticed I was charged on BOTH cards. I called and I was told to wait few days and the charge on the first card would have disappeared. I waited... nothing changed. I wanted to talk with the manager, but apparently this guy is NEVER available. I called and went there in person several times with my bank statements printed out, none could solve the issue. Eventually spoke with the manager, who told me to send to his email copy of my bank accounts with the statement showing (like I have all this time to waste? Do they think Im making this whole deal up for 26$? What about giving me a free meal and PEACE OUT?). I did emailed him all documents...He NEVER answered back. Called again, he was not at the restaurant. I'm so pissed that I've wasted all this time and got robbed. It's just unfair. Be aware of how they treat their clients!"}
{"text":"This place it's amazing the food and the service are awesome. Every time we come to the Platform show in August we have dinner here! You can't miss the Spicy Tuna Salad and the Avocado Train delicious. We were there last night a have a great time! If you stay at the Hard Rock it's waking distance!"}
{"text":"It is the second time we have been here. Really good service and good. I like the chicken karaage most since it's really unique! Slightly breaded but superb juicy! Surely, it will be better if you order two bottled beers during their happy hour."}
{"text":"Good place especially for groups.  Pretty solid sushi and although it's in a strip mall, I actually prefer it since the prices are reasonable and it's nice and low key."}
{"text":"Mmmm.... I had the green chili tempura roll salmon nigiri and a California roll. Everything was delicious! Great service..."}
{"text":"Great restaurant just 5 minutes off the strip. The sushi was excellent and moderately priced. The total was probably half what it would have been at a more well known sushi bar in Vegas. Service was also excellent, the waitress was right over when our glasses were low to refill them. Highly recommend and will return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Delicious. Enjoyed the octopus sushi, salmon sushi and shrimp tempura roll. Really good udon. Nice chicken curry rice. Good meal, service & atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times over the past few years. Always a must have.  The service is great and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I've ever had.  Yes, I'm sober.  I travel frequently, and this is without a doubt the freshest salmon I've ever had.  
-salmon tataki
-sunset roll
-kiss of fire

You're welcome."}
{"text":"Yum! Great garlic edamame, wonderful fresh sushi, and the ceviche was delicious. Cool vibe, creative menu."}
{"text":"Great food... we stop by 3 time a year. We are from cali. Love Las vegas. I bring customer all the time from local to international all of them love the spot."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious and the service was excellent. Great atmosphere and I will definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"It is close to the hotel and convenient.  It fulfills food needs and in a tasty fashion.  But compared to other sushi places it is ok.  Let's leave it at that."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a great sushi place that's consistent. I purchased a Groupon for this place since it was close by my house. I took a friend for lunch and we were told we don't get the special lunch prices if we use a Groupon. So in the end, it really didn't save us any money. Regardless of that, we were one of two parties there during that time and our rolls were delivered far apart. Plus, all of the rolls were so-so. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Came in a few times with my boyfriend, once with his dad & another time with our friends. Both times the food was tasty- our favorite was a  salmon roll topped with a creamy sauce and macadamia nuts, and this has been the only place to have it. But at $20 per roll, it's the kind of place we go to only when we'll be sharing with many people. It's close to my work and open late, which is great considering I get off work around late some days- but if I can't afford to eat there then it's not a viable option. 

The interior is nice, with long wooden tables and an open feel despite the small size. The music doesn't really jibe with the asian food theme, and there are large TV screens along some of the walls playing random video.

Overall the food is tasty but expensive. For the same price range I could have multiple courses at Ichiza. The salmon killer roll IS especially good, so I would go back for that sometime, but expect the bill to run a bit high. It can also be awkward navigating out of the parking lot given the location and all the one-way streets."}
{"text":"Very quiet when we went in for an early dinner. Right across from the Hard Rock you can walk across the street. They were nice-made us some rolls from a very busy menu of rolls. We ordered a cold sake thought it was coming in a larger bottle, our bad but for the price we asked to just get the LARGE bottle. The next size up. It made sense. So they came and nicely poured a half empty bottle of that sake. Not sure if they poured it out or someone else had a half bottle....Regardless they were happy to do this. When we didn't finish it of course, it was huge, we thought we'd cap it and take it with us to our Hotel. WE do this at every restaurant in SD all the time. Cork your wine and take it with you if you don;t finish it. In Vegas where everyone walks around the streets with alcohol, no big deal right. Well our waiter was happy to go back and put in a to go container but the owner stopped him. Said it was illegal that we couldn't take it with us but he was happy to put our name on it. Well, what when we came back in a few weeks or months.?? He wasn't nice at all, or apologetic. Rude and didn't care really. Totally ruined the feel of this place for me. The sushi wasn't amazing anyways and in Vegas there is an abundance of killer places to eat."}
{"text":"Totally average, non-memorable. I think a lot of other working girls go there. Also the wait staff is beautiful. Nothing to really report other than that.

nice ambiance, upscale motif, a bit classier than most local places tend to be. The Sushi bar is very uncomfortable though.
Transfriendly- A"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. The Kai roll is a must. The location is perfect. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place when I was working in a Vegas show in 2012. I live in Los Angeles and I visit Las Vegas quite often. There wasn't a single Vegas trip that I didn't stop by Kaizen to have my favorite sushi. I've been to hundreds of sushi restaurants including LA's top rated and most expensive - no one can compete with the taste of food like at Kaizen.
My favorite is a chicken teriyaki bowl and garlic edamame. My spouse loves the avocado train , Palm Springs, orange blossom rolls and pretty much everything else that's on the menu. 
Top sushi restaurants with an amazing environment and music !!!
I'm definitely signing my name under it.

{"text":"I was at this place at a weekend for a date night with my girlfriend. I'd have to say the cherry blossom tasted spectacular, had great appetizer selections and especially our server Victor delivered great, timely service! Will surely visit here again in the future! Also a very nice interior! Awesome Sushi place!"}
{"text":"This place is amaaaaaaazing!!! The rolls came out fast, they were reasonably priced & they had amazing green apple flavored sake.. It was so smooth you couldn't taste any alcohol!

Service was great, atmosphere was nice, they play music videos in a huge screen, and they also have large tables for groups, as well as private tables for couples.

I'd definitely come here again, their menu is large with a lot of great choices!!"}
{"text":"Sit at the sushi bar and you will immediately notice that something is off. The counter height is at least a half-a-foot too high - check it out.

Their spicy crab hand roll ($5.50) looked something out of a scary anime movie. It was a crumpled up sheet of imitation crab soaked in a warm red mystery sauce sloppily stuffed into a sheet of nori. By the time it was handed to me it was soggy and clearly unappetizing. I've *never* seen a spicy crab hand roll look like this. I would even go as far as saying it was really gross. I dare say it tasted even worse than it looked - warm, chewy, and messy. Somewhere in Japan, this has got to be considered illegal sushi.

Our sushi chef's demeanor was deadpan and straight up unfriendly. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but we soon caught his drift and decided to leave after another order (a scallop sushi roll which was ugly as shit, and made without care).

Just when I thought we cut our losses and were off to another establishment to save our supper, I was given the \"Sorry, sir, our system is down, can you pay with cash?\" What complete crap. I should've called their bluff. It's been 5 years since I've encountered that in Vegas. Visa, Mastercard Inc., and the Better Business Bureau should be notified.

The industry folks love this place, and I don't understand it. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"It's kind of hit or miss with this place. Decent but I've had much better. Servers are sometimes nice but seems like a lot going on behind the scenes. Chefs are fun but sometimes seem over worked and grumpy. There are actually very few sushi bars I know of that are actually owned by Japanese owners, but when they are, you can be sure that they take the art of sushi making very seriously. This place, not so much.


I tried it again. Fish was fresh and tasty. If only the busboy spoke english, he might've heard me say i didn't want anymore tea. Instead, he reaches over my plate to grab my cup and then proceeds to spill it on my jacket sitting on the seat next to me. Not to mention he ran my food to the wrong person. 

Wish the bussers would learn how to communicate properly...and, why isn't my server bringing my food anyways???"}
{"text":"As soon as me and my boyfriend walked in we were immediately served , the place is beautiful and great customer service ! Will deff come back here for our sushi !"}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for two years and ever since then (almost 10 years ago now) I have been searching the U.S. For authentic and amazing sushi and this place had it! The \"beef sashimi\" (they call it something fancy but that's what it is) is AMAZING! And the three rolls we got were just as good! I would be be surprised if my boyfriend and I came back before going home!"}
{"text":"4.5 STARS

I WISH there was a place like this in LA: what can be better than late-night sushi?!? We always make sure to visit Kaizen when in Vegas...

The Lowdown:

- HAPPY HOUR starts at midnight (!!!)
Prior to midnight this place might be empty, and it sometimes begins to fill up late on weekdays. 

- FOOD - High quality ingredients.
Albacore & salmon sushi melt in your mouth. Actually, everything we've tried is delicious. The shishito pepper appetizer didn't disappoint (a personal favorite, which I often use to help gage the overall quality at sushi joints). I'd say this place is comparable to ever popular Katsu-Ya in LA.

- HUGE MENU
It takes a while to peruse the entire menu and get a feel for the many specialty rolls - there's something for everyone.

- LOCATION
I like the fact that this is an off-strip, \"locals' favorite\" type of place. 
Very cool, un-touristy crowd.

- PRICES
Its surprising to know that so many people think this place is expensive. Haven't you noticed that EVERYTHING in Vegas is expensive?!? In terms of sushi prices I'd say this joint is average, and the Happy Hour prices are a real bargain!

* WARNING *
CHECK YOUR BILL!
I'm docking half a point because the last time we were here they \"forgot\" to charge us Happy Hour prices, and gave us a bill with regular prices instead. NOT cool. Of course they fixed it when we spoke up, but if not for this incident Kaizen would be nearly perfect  :("}
{"text":"I love this place, my favorite sushi in Las Vegas.  The mango lobster roll is fantastic.  Only negative is that sometimes it can get weird in there as drunks from the Hard Rock wander in.

Important tip: After midnight, bottles of booze are two-for-one."}
{"text":"My friend and I just landed in Las Vegas after a very long flight and we hadn't eaten in ten hours
We came to the plaza where this place is because we wanted a foot rub
We went into some barbecue place but they kept saying that everything took a really long time and I was very hungry so we came into the sushi place which is the most amazing place that I've ever eaten in Las Vegas
Food is incredibly fresh everything was good we ate several rolls soup salad sake steak and I would come back here every day

It's completely delicious the service is very fast everyone's very attentive and it's totally got a clean Vegas five

I would highly suggest this to anyone and the guys who work in and sushi counter is very cute

Waitress was nice the seaweed salad is excellent the Mississippi is delicious the Eda mommy was fresh and steamy in the Orange Blossom Hill is the best get that and don't miss the steak salad it's yummy"}
{"text":"Hands-down, The Best Udon I've ever had. Period. 

Living in Pasadena, I'm constantly searching high and low for good quality udon. I don't know why it's so difficult to master. It seems like good ramen is easier to find in LA than good udon.

I had my fingers crossed when I ordered the udon at Kaizen but wasn't expecting too much. But my first taste had me closing my eyes in ecstasy.  I was in heaven.  I was incredibly starving at the time, so that might have swayed my opinion a little, but the broth was delicate and complex and oh-so-delicious. The noodles were the perfect texture.

The only downside is that the service wasn't good.  After waiting forever I had to flag someone down to take our order. Then they forgot our order of edamame. Food took a while to come out too.

But it's all worth it for the Udon!!! YUM!"}
{"text":"The Mister and I are staying at Hyatt Place and wanted sushi and spotted Kaizen from our hotel window. We get here and there is a sign that reads 'Voted best sushi in Las Vegas.\" We are excited but when we walked in, it was empty at 1 PM on a Saturday and was reluctant to try.

I was pouting because I wanted AYCE sushi but the mister noted quality is more important than quantity and he was right!! I ordered the Kaizen roll...it was such a marriage in my mouth!!! Try it! Also their green tea ice fream doesnt taste powdery but creamy! Their portions are generous as well. The mister ordered sashimi 10 piece and he vouched the fish was fresh.

The place looks like it is more for the dinner crowd judging by the many speakers and projectors.

They got my vote for best non AYCE sushi in Vegas so far!"}
{"text":"We were staying at Hard Rock & walked across the street for dinner. What a gem this place is!

My husband had a Philadelphia roll & said it was so fresh & delicious. 

I was looking for something vegan so i asked if they could make me a teriyaki bowl (which was on the menu but with meat or shrimp) with tofu. They did & it was very good! 

We were very happy with the food & service.

I would go back again."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. When we walked in they seated us immediately, our food was very good and served to us very quickly, our waiter was very attentive to our needs, and I will definitely be back again. I had the Shrimp Killer Roll and it was absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Solid Solid Solid, my fine yelp friends!  Came here for lunch, had a great prix fix type option, but decided to go completely a la carte.  LOVED the spicy tuna roll, just gave my tongue enough tingle to satisfy.  Hamachi was tasty, and wasabi oyster shooters were pure heaven - ooo-fa!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service complimented with kind and courteous staff. Great choice for a late night meal with nice music and ambience.

Rainbow roll and cherry blossom are great choices and are extremely fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I had RoadRunner delivery from there. I always really enjoy their rolls. Especially the Japanese lasagna. It's the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Good spot to get your grub on. Music wasn't to loud. Friendly service clean. All around good eats"}
{"text":"Incredible Delicious!!! Open late night just across the Hard Rock Cafe without the eye-gouging prices from the strip.  Was actually suggested by the valet at the Cosmopolitan ( In Vegas always pay attention to the suggestions of the Valet and the Taxicab Handlers on the hotels) 

Have eaten before at Sushi Roku and Shibuya and this place is as good, maybe even better than those! Try the Unicorn Roll it was amazing and a steal at ($14)

Me and my wife loved it and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is our second dining experience at Kaizen Fusion Roll. We we very happy with the friendly service and the wonderful rolls. We drive in from Boulder City but it is worth the drive and we will come in more often. We tried 3 different rolls and each was excellent. Experiment, you won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"If you have read some of my other Vegas reviews, you will know that I am not local but I visit very often and for extended periods of time.  I also have a lot of friends who live in Vegas and work in the service industry.  As a result, I have tried a large number of sushi bars and restaurants both on and off Las Vegas Blvd.

A friend of mine who has lived in town for 18 years took us to Kaizen one night and we sat at the bar.  The food was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  The nigiri was average, but the rolls we had were nothing special.  It might have just been the night we went, but something did not seem right with the items that came from the fryer (like the tempura).  One plus is that the price was fair and the place was open late.  The service was friendly, but a bit slow.  Overall, I will not likely go back.  With so many options, this restaurant failed to make an impression and for the price point, I prefer Hamada down the road."}
{"text":"First Impressions:
Clean place. Nice decor. Good atmosphere. They have a TV.
It's a nice and quiet place, but there weren't many people there, so it might be different when it's packed.

About me:
I'm Japanese. I love sushi. I go out to eat sushi once a month or so by myself. I was in Vegas just for the weekend.

Summary:
I went at around 8:30 pm, and they were out of uni & toro. I ordered mainly nigiri sushi and not much stood out. I also got the chicken katsu, which wasn't bad but nothing special.
Food: 3/5 - Average
Service: 4/5 - Good
Overall: 3/5

Review:
I went at around 8:30pm on a Sunday night with a friend. I made a reservation twenty minutes beforehand, but the place was almost empty when we arrived. The first things I always order at a sushi bar are toro and uni. They were both out, but it was 8:30pm, so it was understandable.

I started out with albacore belly, mackerel, salmon, ikura, and tuna. I usually always order albacore belly, mackerel, and salmon as they're a few of my favorite sushi. The ones I had here weren't bad, but they didn't taste great either. I was here with a friend who doesn't eat sushi as often, so I ordered the tuna (something common) and ikura (slightly obscure) for him as well. The tuna and ikura tasted better than I expected, but my expectations were set a little low after eating their albacore belly, mackerel, and salmon. I may have ordered something else as well here, but I'm drawing a blank.

I didn't want the bill to get too large, so I ordered chicken katsu to share with my friend. The chicken katsu was a little thin, and they were cut into pieces the size of a pencil (in terms of thickness/width). This is personal preference, but I preferred the pieces to be a little fatter/wider.

I wanted to finish off the night with some more sushi, so I asked the sushi chef for a recommendation and ordered the madai. It was actually pretty good. Possibly the best sushi of the night. I ended up ordering another serving.

The bill came out to be ~$100 for the two of us, which is average for a sushi place (not too cheap, not too expensive). I paid $60 ($10 tip) for the meal.

During the meal, the waitress made sure I didn't run out of my tea (she asked if I would like more when I was low), so that was nice. She also asked us multiple times how our meal was going. So the service here was pretty good.

Conclusion:
It's a decent sushi place, but it wasn't good enough to make it a go-to sushi bar every time I'm in Vegas. I think it's worth exploring other options.

Food: 3/5 - Average
Atmosphere: 4/5 - Good
Service: 4/5 - Good
Overall: 3/5 (weighed on food score)

Other thoughts:
I went to a sushi place in San Diego called Sushi Ota about a month prior to visiting Kaizen Sushi in Vegas. The sushi at Sushi Ota tasted incredible, so it raised the bar for my future sushi outings. I may have rated Kaizen Sushi higher if I hadn't visited Sushi Ota."}
{"text":"After wandering around the strip seeing many Pokemon and other characters like a fat guy in a bikini, I really needed something to cleanse my palette. A friend recommended this place.  My group started with the grilled ika which came with a spicy sauce and this awesome scallop mushroom app that was in a cream sauce topped with a charred cheese - do delicious, I just wish I had some to scoop the extra sauce. Then we had a few roll by then the scarring that occurred from the fat bikini was gone. But we stayed for dessert - fried tempura cheesecake and deep fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great staff, fun environment. Fair prices. 

I ordered the paradise roll at the advice of the waitress and it truly was paradise."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sushi spot. It's gorgeous inside and has the most amazing quality food!! The staff is friendly and service is fast! I highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST SUSHI I HAVE EVER HAD!  Found this restaurant thru an acquaintance back in 2010 and never ate raw sushi until I came here and it has changed me.  Ever since 2010 I have been on a search in multiple states to find sushi that can rival KAIZEN but have failed.  This destination is a must for every vegas trip I take.  Favorite sushi is the \"sexy roll!!\"  I could eat 3 orders by myself.  Great restaurant!!!  Keep it going!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. Food is always fresh and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great Service. A nice \"off-the-strip\" option. The super reasonable prices almost made me forget that I was in Las Vegas! Also, I was there around 10pm. They have a reverse Happy Hour that offered 2 for 1 drinks. I'll definitely go here again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Back again, one year later. Never disappoints!!!!
If you want great sushi at a very fair price, you need to come here!"}
{"text":"10/10 Would recommend. Good lunch deals, for that quickie to satisfy you and your hangry friends. You rock, don't ever change. 
Forever yours,

I have to add more words because nobody likes just the tip."}
{"text":"Came all the way here bc I wanted to Gangnam kbbq but they were so busy so we headed Kaizen instead. 
We got the Lasagna, BBQ and California roll.
And it tastes absolutely amazing. We loved the bbq roll tho. 
The service was great. We were seated right away and servers would always check on us. Will come back definitely!(:"}
{"text":"Heard It was great and we were not that impressed. I'm not one to write negative, but I'm sorry our rolls were a bit fishy. This place came highly recommended so maybe It was an off night."}
{"text":"I have a 2 years baby and unfortunately they asked us to not feed him with the pasta plate we brought for him!
We were very disappointed since my wife had to go feed him in the car!
We spent over a 100$ and this is the last time for us there!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. Robust menu with plenty of tasty options. I would recommend this to anyone staying close by!"}
{"text":"Nice service !  Nice food!
You have to come in hereb
Yaki udon and salmon roll is so perfect
And it's also cheap!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT sushi rolls and a lot to choose from!! Had the krazy boy (deep fried California roll), Tiger eye, and one other. Soo good. Also had the chicken teriyaki bowl which had lots of veggies and rice which was great, as well. Prices very fair and affordable. Great service, they even called a taxi for us after. Will definitely be back. Only a few minutes off the strip."}
{"text":"This place has a great modern look with a great ambiance. The food is great and the lunch special is quite the deal. The california combo - central that came with california rolls, miso soup, side salad and my choice of beef teriyaki was enough to fill me up. I highly recommended this to anyone that enjoys Japanese food."}
{"text":"1st time here, the service is great & the restaurant  is so beautiful! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Definitely worth checking out. It's crowded and always busy but easily the best sushi spot in Aliante. Get the AYCE and try all they have to offer. We came specially for Min, sushi chef, he is a master of his craft."}
{"text":"Absolutely a must try! if you love sushi, I believe this is one of the best places! my personal favorite roll is *salmon killer 2* i'm not a spicy fan, BUT the salmon killer two has the perfect amount of spice and flavor is delicious also! the staff is friendly too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and beautiful location. A must see in the city of Vegas if you're over by the Hardrock hotel and casino. We had the Rose roll and Tokyo roll lil to no rice and tons of flavor."}
{"text":"Don't come to this plaza unless you're strapped with weapons....or at least pepper spray. Even a stun gun would be nice.
Kaizen was okay but damn...this plaza was one hot mess!!!
We haven't parked for 2 seconds yet and bums are already asking for money.

But this sushi place is nothing to write home about. Service was spotty....even though we came on a late Sunday night. After they brought us our drinks and water, we were ready to order some sushi rolls. We had to flag the waitress down, TWICE. It wasn't even busy!!! There were about 5-8 other tables. They didn't bother checking back on us....what if we wanted to order more sushi?!?! I totally would have by the way. We ordered a spicy tuna roll and also a Sunrise Roll. Sushi was delicious and their menu was never ending. I would've loved to try a few more...but DAMN...it was pricey!!!! Our sunrise roll was $13!!! Most of the sushi rolls ran from $10-14 per order. Umm, yeah...no. You're better off going into the heart of Chinatown or even further...(wayyyy further) off the strip for better priced sushi.

Also..side note: if you get cold like myself, BRING A JACKET WITH YOU!!!! They like to keep their fish and customers fresh and cold. Thought I was in their freezer box for a second.

Won't be coming back again. And this side of town is enough to scare the sushi out of me."}
{"text":"In a very convienient location for those staying at the Hard Rock Hotel, and nearby on the strip.  Stay out of the overpriced, overrated Casino sushi joints and take a quick ride down to Kaizen.  The sushi is fresh, staff attentive, and the beer and sake floweth.  

You can have your choice of traditional sushi, sashimi, or get adventurous with one of thier tasty specialty rolls.  The SPICY TUNA SALAD is a must try; large portions of tuna with a fresh mix of greens.

This is one of my favorite sushi spots anywhere, and the best I have had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite late night sushi restaurant. As long as you're having a good time and of course ordering food and drinks they will stay open. Usually close about 4 am, it's also a great meeting spot before hitting the strip. The vegas roll is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I'm still in love with Kaizen! I hadn't been back to Vegas in a year and a half. I wasn't about to skip going to a Kaizen before returning home. My boyfriend and I ordered the garden salad, octopus and cucumber salad, octopus sashimi, the tuna and shrimp in a cucumber roll, an avocado roll, and a chicken teriyaki roll. We love food! Everything was delicious, so much so that I was ready to go back the next day!! It's nice to get away from the craziness of the strip and have something so close by!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Kaizen Fusion Roll and Sushi. Sometimes a restaurant fits perfectly into your day or even your week. In the fall of 2014 I had been in Las Vegas briefly and had quickly grabbed takeout from here. I remember thinking the ambience was fun. Returning to Las Vegas in December of 2015 I used Yelp to track down this sushi restaurant that I remembered enjoying but couldn't remember the name of.

Since I was traveling for work I was often on my own for dinner. Walking into Kaizen I was instantly welcomed and the staff was more than happy to give me a table to myself since the restaurant was not too busy. 

Over the three separate visits I made to Kaizen I got to sample a variety of rolls, all of which I enjoyed:
-Philadelphia Roll-specially requested for this to be made with salmon and cream cheese inside and salmon on top
-Sexy Roll-spicy tuna inside topped with fresh tuna, smelt eggs, and tangy sauce
-Crunch Roll-deep fried shrimp, Yamagobo, cucumber inside topped with tempura crunch and eel sauce
-Red Rock Roll-deep fried shrimp and cucumber inside topped with spicy tuna, seared tuna, and spicy mayo
-Hot Night Roll-deep fried shrimp and cucumber inside topped with spicy tuna and eel sauce
-Orange Blossom Roll-deep fried chopped shrimp and crab inside topped with salmon and tangy sauce

Everything I had was delicious and the service is polite and quick. Definitely great to stop in for dinner when traveling for business. On weekends the restaurant can get significantly busier so expect to sit at the bar if you're dining solo."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I would definitely come back here when I visit Vegas!!! Dragon roll and kiss of fire is delish!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here our last night in Vegas, and it was such an excellent choice. Everything from the food and the customer service to the decor was fabulous. We started out with salmon cheese sticks, and they were so good that I contemplated getting another order. I had to restrain myself. We moved on to the sushi rolls. We had the salmon tempura, calamari tempura, and tiger eye rolls. The rolls were fresh and delicious. Amazingly delicious. Kaizen has become one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to. It is located a few minutes off the Strip and is definitely worth the trip. Usually, I don't go to restaurants more than once when I'm vacationing since there are so many options, but we've already mentioned Kaizen for our next trip."}
{"text":"The surprising thing about Vegas is how few great dining options there are late-night.  Sure, every hotel has its late-night restaurant but they're generally pretty average.  This place was great!  They had funky rolls and good drinks and at 2am we weren't expecting anything this good.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"It's open til 4 am!!!  I love that it's close to the strip so I can satisfy my late night sushi cravings after partying in the clubs.  

My favorite roll is the First Kiss Roll.  It's kinda expensive at $15 but it's SOOOOOO good.  Besides that, the only thing I really get is the $5 spicy tuna rolls.   

Gone here many times and it never disappoints me, except for the one time where it was 3:40am and last call was at 3:30am =("}
{"text":"Late night sushi across the street from Hard Rock. Pretty good at 2am. Had a crazy girl roll, Nevada roll and spicy tataki roll. Could have passed on the NV but the other two were tasty. Friendly waitstaff. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I am jealous of you Vegas locals!

You have a place to get sushi at 4AM on the weekdays and up to 6AM on the weekends?!

Yes it is a TAD bit more expensive then other places, but the rolls that we purchased were delicious. 

We had Spicy Tuna, Las Vegas, California, and Night roll.

The hot tea was one of the better ones I've tried as well.

Sushi is not overfilled with rice, the crab (if not imitation) in the California roll is not drenched in mayo. 

The staff was friendly, and service was good. 

It is also easy to order because their menu is loaded with pictures, so if you are not sure, feel free to order with your eyes.

The restaurant is located in a strip mall by the Hard Rock. The inside decor is really \"cool\" and what I guess I can describe as \"fusion\". On the outside you wouldn't really think anything of this place, but hey it's whats on the inside that counts. They even have a DJ playing some 90s music for that extra \"hip\" feel. It was more than welcomed.

For late late late night-- or early morning cravings of Sushi, check this place out."}
{"text":"Awesome. I loved it. It was my first time trying sushi and my kid also adored baked salmon rolls"}
{"text":"I came here because of a friend's recommendation and I'm so glad I did. It's a bit off the strip, near the Hard Rock and the area (I guess LV in general) isn't the safest... but the restaurant itself is cute and cozy inside. We enjoyed all of the rolls we tried and found the fish to be fresh and the service to be friendly."}
{"text":"Let's paint the picture. I show up for dinner alone, slightly before rush so I sit at the bar. Wow! Just wow! The Sexy M roll was so freaking good. I mean I could have ordered three of those! But my stock definitely couldn't have taken that kind of work. I also got the Palm Springs roll, this was also wonderful but that Sexy roll stole the show for me! The guys were wonderful! I wish I was in town longer so that I could go again!"}
{"text":"Most fairly priced sushi anywhere close to the strip. An okay selection of rolls and kitchen entrees as well as great, fast service. Would gladly return here if we stay at the same hotel next year."}
{"text":"DELICIOIUS!

And they even have chopped fresh wasabi.   

I got a roll and a bunch of nigiri, and everything was awesome.

Loves it."}
{"text":"They now have a section where rolls are half off.  The last time I've eaten here was probably 2 months ago.  So hopefully they will still have it.  I thought this place was just a little expensive.  They do have a lot of creative sushi/dishes.  I see I'm writing for the paradise location.  This location has been much more busier.  The henderson location seems to be slower and less crowded if that suits you."}
{"text":"Oh yeah my favorite sushi spot away, yet not far from the strip. They have great service, delicious sushi rolls, and nice decor. The sushi is inexpensive to average. It's located right across the street from the hard rock, so it won't take you more than 15 mins to get here if you're staying on the strip. If you are craving good sushi and don't feel like waiting hours in order to get it, just drive or take a can here. It will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Truly disappointed.  The service was horrible and when I pointed it out I got excuses about the kitchen.  Don't make excuses, take responsibility for the poor service.  There was staff standing around talking to each other instead of serving customers.  The food was just okay, not super great.  We won't be going back.  I wouldn't recommend this place, there is way better sushi restaurants in the area with better food and superior service. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have eaten here twice and the rolls are fresh and quick. The staff is so nice and unlike other places that serve sushi to locals like me, the wait staff here seems to be both traditional and friendly. They have good communication with each other and all of them check on you. I appreciate this place for its atmosphere and the friendly attitude of the staff!"}
{"text":"Well I have mixed feelings about this place. It's close to my apartment so that was a plus. Looks nice and upscale inside. What took it back down was the wooden chop sticks. I think if you go upscale make the chopsticks upscale too and stop cutting down trees. The menu is huge!!!! 

Ok so the BBQ roll isn't good to me. The meat was chewy. Too chewy I swallowed many bites whole because I couldn't break it down. Crunchy roll was good. Tried the crazy boy it was interesting. Not bad but I just didn't like it. I had ordered the Katsura roll to try it but it never came. They charged me for it and then I told them I never got it. They took it off. 

Ok so here is where I get picky. One if I order something bring it to me. Two 3 different people came up to our table asking if we are done eating and paid yet. Seriously I ordered rolls a few times relax and let me eat or wait for the goof.  When I'm done eating I'll let you know. And three when we walk in and I tell you we want a table instead of sushi bar don't suggest the sushi bar over and over."}
{"text":"This a a great little place off of the strip. Everyone on my group was craving sushi so we decided to hit this place because it was close, in a little shopping center across from the Hard Rock.  It's small but don't let that fool you.  We were quickly seated and orders were taken right away.  Talk about great sushi. Everything we had was great. I had a dragon roll and crunch roll. There prices are pretty good for the quality and size of your rolls.  Pineapple sakitini is a great cocktail to order.  

I almost forgot that they stay open until at least 4am everyday, a must for vegas if you are into hanging out late. So if you have a late night craving stop it.  If you haven't had enough to drink they have buy one get one free."}
{"text":"The only reason this has 2 stars is because the food was decent, and another waiter came and asked if we needed anything after we had sat there for 45 minutes, waiting for our waitress to come ask us for our order. Then our second waiter forgot about us as well. The food was cold after 2 minutes of getting to us, and we literally almost left them a pile of barf to clean up. $0 tip for you guys! And we are normally the type to give 20-25%"}
{"text":"If you are going here expecting a 4 star restaurant such as Nobu, you will be disappointed. As a regular sushi eater, this place does not make the cut."}
{"text":"Every time I eat sushi in this city I'm mad at myself. It's always bad. Always. 

This time it was the worst. The yellowtail sushi was boring and the rice was stale. The salmon hand roll; uninspiring. The spider roll came out cold. Not warm, not cool.  COLD. It had been in the fridge. The fried crab was soft and soggy, not warm and crunchy. It was horrible. As in the worst sushi roll ever. I don't even know how the sushi 'chef' looks himself in the mirror. He should be ashamed. 

The server took my order but demanded I also write it down on their silly paper myself to keep track of what I ordered. 

That, and I never did get that glass of water I asked 2 different people for."}
{"text":"Really good sushi and great service. We are locals and love this place. Check out their happy hour if you get the chance."}
{"text":"The last time I was in Vegas this was the last place I  ate before my flight. It was delicious!  Best sushi I ever had the avocado train is amazing!!  I went home and craved this place for weeks. 
I loved there fresh ginger not the cheap pink ginger that most sushi places use.  all there rolls are pretty amazing and at a great price for Vegas. 

I just flew in for another convention and this is the first place I stopped. I think the service was great the sushi was Fresh and location is great right next to CVS for me to pick up some stuff before I get to the over priced hotels. I'll definitely be eating here a couple more times before I fly back home."}
{"text":"Great ambience and food! Good place to eat with friends! Service is fast and good. Loved the soup, baked salmon and the Katsu. Would definitely come back and recommend to friends"}
{"text":"There are times when the thought of leaving the house outweighs the feeling of- if I don't eat sushi right now, I will, in fact, die. I really don't like to get sushi delievered because, it just is never that good, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Plus, I just wasn't ready to die. I used the roadrunner food delievery app and it let me customize my order exactly how I like it (I'm one of those annoying cant order directly off the menu people) . Food was delievered to me exactly how I wanted it and I got to eat with my favorite dining companion, my cat- Ape. I also did not have to wear pants like a civilized person. I took my first nom, and it was delicious!! Cold, fresh and yummy. I also love their \"beef tarta\" . This place is great. If you can crawl outside with pants on, they are open late and super friendly inside."}
{"text":"The general consensus was that the food was ok with the exception with a few items that was better.  They were very accommodating to the 14 girls we had.  The biggest complaint I have is that the rice fell apart in my rolls."}
{"text":"Nope. The sushi rice wasn't cooked properly. I admit I am an idiot for ordering uni but it came out a little darker of a color than typical and it didn't taste quite what I am used to. Maybe not 100% fresh. Edible not enjoyable. They were nice enough to take it back though. Not what I am used to very under par.  Maybe you need to get wildly intoxicated. Terrible place. The worst sushi I've ever had."}
{"text":"Took Yelp advice and this was the closest place to eat.   Couldn't print their coupons but they said they would honor them....NOT!!  We ordered sake bombs because we had coupons and they only honored one and called it a birthday coupon, after telling us both were free.  Food was good, presentation great, service not so amazing.  We aren't the Hard Rock crowd, but came for food and deserved better service.  The presentation was amazing and the sushi good, but the service lacked for us old ladies."}
{"text":"Prices are up to par with most average sushi places.  Nigiri Sushi is about $5-8 depending on which fish.  Cut rolls are $5-12.  The spicy tuna salad seems to be a favorite.  Alas the salad seemed to be just a generic salad that they bought at safeway/vons.

The Hamachi was fresh and the two pieces were nice and big.  I wasn't that hungry so I didn't try that many things.  Though the korean bbq roll was a nice try to something new, it wasn't that special to make me want to order again (may as well just get korean bbq shortribs with rice), as there are so many other rolls to try.

I'd go again, prices and quality are up to par, and this time I'd try the other rolls.

Good for rolls, decent for nigiri (it's no sasabune)."}
{"text":"Yelp, you're fired. Four stars?! All I wanted was non-AYCE sushi, rated decently,  and near the strip. Jesus H. Christ! It's a fail when you come into a restaurant starving and you leave with everyone in your party invoking the Lord's name with his middle initial.*

Things started out okay with them seating us promptly. We drooled over the menu and ordered enough to feed every child in Botswana. It went downhill from there. The first piece of sushi, two pieces of uni, took almost an hour to get to our table. WE WERE WASTING VALUABLE GAMBLING TIME! Everyone at the craps table is depending on me to get back in the game.

The sushi man was a little stingy. It wasn't like I was ordering a 49 cent taco from Del Taco in South LA and then complaining to the cashier, and then to the manager that there wasn't enough meat in my sub-dollar taco, all the while getting approving \"um-huh\"s from my significant other standing behind me. You know? They could've been slightly more generous. 

What's funny is I think they were Thai. Thai reminds me of Thailand. Thailand reminds me of my vacation to Phuket. In Phuket, we journeyed to a steakhouse that was highly, I mean HIGHLY, rated by Tripadvisor. So I thinks, maybe we's getting a good deal on expensive steak. My partner orders a ribeye, bone-in, because that's how us gangsters roll. The waitress retorts, \"Just to let you know, it's a little chewy.\" My partner responds, \"What do you mean?\" Waitress says, \"Are you Malay?\" My partner, looking confused, says, \"No.\" Waitress replies, \"Have you had a steak before?\" HAHAHA. Okay, screw you guys. It was funny at the time.

ANYWAYZ. You're better off going to some of the better AYCE in Vegas and not stuffing your face. You'll pay the same amount, or less, and get better quality sushi.

*In almost a decade spent in church, they never taught me what what Jesus's middle initial stood for, although the whispers say it may be Herbert, but it wasn't from me."}
{"text":"My personal favorite when in Vegas. Four of us went again tonight. Had four or five different controls, some sushi, some sashimi and even some oysters. As usual, everything was fantastic. Maybe a little less attentive than I'm used to Kama maybe could have improved on that but overall another great time at one of the best sushi restaurants in town

 I've been to this place on three or four occasions. It never lets me down. From the sushi to the sushi me to the cut rolls, this place is top-notch. I also like how it's not so formal. It's a place where you can be somewhat formal or completely laid back and just enjoy some amazing sushi"}
{"text":"amazing amazing amazing. By far the best sushi I ever had in my life. I am happy to admit Im a local here. I come as often as humanly possible.

I first discovered this place about two months ago. Everything is good. My favorite is the crispy rice appitizer. It's just yum.

matter of fact... I am heading there now! they're open late, perfect for the casino workers and late night crowd like us!"}
{"text":"Best sushi we have had in a long time! Highly recommend this place Great Sushi excellent service. Very cozy and welcoming atmosphere, love the area under the little lights your facing the bar basically. It's a small place but it's delicious sushi definitely   recommend the Nevada roll and the avocado one so tasty!!"}
{"text":"Kaizen is a destination restaurant worth the flight to Vegas.  The sushi chefs are incredibly talented and come up with some really fresh combinations.  My favorite?  The Rose Roll!  Why?  Because it has no rice or seaweed, it's all fish wrapped in fish.  I have them add some jalape√±os on top to give a bit of spice.  Amazing!  Fresh sashimi and nigiri, doesn't get better than this. Also the prices are super reasonable, we fed 9 people for less than $900 and this included drinks, food, sake etc.  Will go every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Terrible food, fish not fresh and the manager was our waiter.... He was very rude and unprofessional. Didn't try to help us at all! I asked for the manager again because I didn't believe it was him and the same guy came, talking about how he is the manager, the CEO, and the owner.... Who talks like that? All I wanted was a roll off my bill, he bargained with me asked if I wanted 50% off of one of the rolls.... And than didn't give me the discount!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place of all time. I want to move to Vegas just for the sushi here!! Service is great and the rolls never disappoint! Fish is always super fresh and tasty.  I always get the white rose roll avocado train and my new favorite is the spicy tuna salad. If I could eat here every day I would but i have to make the four hour trip to Vegas just for my yummy sushi rolls :(  love this place and the ambience. Great for night owls like me and also love the music. I rarely leave yelp reviews but I have to for  kaizen! Please move closer to LA!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential, considering the fact that the location is pretty good.  The place attempts at an identity; dimly lit rooms, walls and menus decorated in sleek yet simple design.  Bold and different from other sushi venues in Las Vegas.  Overall, not bad.

Even the food is designed to look cute and all.  You may notice the sushi takes a little bit longer to prepare than other venues, and obviously it's because they're taking their time laying out and arranging the sushi to make it look nice.  Makes up for a nice Kodak moment if you're into that kind of stuff.  It's impressive, but the bottom line is that no amount of decoration can make a delicious meal.  The fact is, the sushi tastes bad. Really bad.

To be fair, the sushi may be OK for first timers or real causal sushi goers, but it just doesn't cut it for me.  The biggest reason is that the rice is terrible.  It doesn't mix well with the sashimi at all.  It's always because the rice is cooked too thin,there's too much rice in the roll, it's not packed correctly with the sashimi, the list goes on and on.

The fish is OK, but not mind-blowing.  The best way to find out if a sushi joint is good is to eat the most perishable fish on their menu.  I always try the Ebi(Shrimp), Ama-ebi(Sweet Shrimp), and Uni(Sea Urchin) as starters.  Try one of these as a Nigiri (Fish and Rice only, with no tacky sauce), and you'll know in a heartbeat if the fish is fresh or not.  It doesn't matter anyways because you shouldn't order Nigiri at a sushi joint that doesn't have AYCE unless you wanna put a hole in your wallet.

The price is pretty overpriced as well.  I know it's near the Strip and everything, but it seems that's all you're paying for at this point.  The food does no help to justify the price of the dishes.

Oh, I just want to point out it took nearly 20 minutes for them to prepare a California Roll.  Unbelievable.  I don't care if it looked pretty because when I'm hungry I can eat anything that looks close to edible.  The thought of waiting another 20 minutes was insane.   I can't imagine how much longer it will take if I ordered it during their peak hours.  If you go there around 10-11pm when they're busy, good luck ever getting your food..

In conclusion, considering that the food comes out looking pretty like a flower arrangement and takes a long time, its more like a lounge-like environment.  Go with a couple friends when you aren't too hungry, have a couple drinks and poke at the pretty food that takes forever to come out.  In that sense, it's an OK experience.  But as far as taste goes, stay awaaaay. 

PRO: Nice decoration, location is OK.  Sushi may be decent for casuals
CON: Sushi tastes bland, dishes takes a really long time to come out, no AYCE"}
{"text":"Amazing place with very tasty sushi! Presentation is 10 star and customer service is impeccable. Also music is very pleasant and relaxing"}
{"text":"This is probably now my favorite Sushi spot here. I decided to come here for my 4th Anniversary dinner and I don't regret it! The sushi is \"REALLY\" good and the presentation of it is so far the neatest I have seen out of all of my sushi experiences. Sad to say however that it was too bad I could only take down three rolls because my stomach seriously wanted to go for a fourth! I definitely recommend this place. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, and the sushi is great."}
{"text":"It's great food but I'm not a fan of places that are not all you can eat, specifically saying for this here because the Kaizen by my house in Aliante (N.LV) is AYCE. So I was a little upset I came here assuming it was the same. Was no fault of their own and the staff was very good  won't be coming back though. It's so expensive to come here when all you can eat sushi is in abundance in this city."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. They were extra attentive and accommodating. I got the Kaizen Ceviche -- highly recommended! 

It's really close to the Bellagio where we stayed. It's not too out of the way. 

Definitely come out to Kaizen if you're in the mood for something delicious.

{"text":"I've been coming here for years & always a great time! I usually get the hot night roll or chicken Katsu bowl, which is consistently yummy. Also a great late-night spot close to Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this place...I was staying across the street at the Hardrock and nursing a major hangover that I had already attended to earlier in the day by ordering eggs benedict from room service ( good room service FYI )...anyway still lagging and trying to decide to rise and shine or hermit in my room when my friend said he was coming over...so oh shit, guess I better get up...he asks me what I want to eat and I say Sushi downstairs....I start getting ready and start imaging what I will order once at Sushi, my friend gets there we head downstairs walk in the sushi spot and God Damn it...I'm 10 minutes too late and they are closing...argh....so they recommended across the street...I'm glad they did.

Yeap its an American style sushi spot ran by maybe Koreans with all kinds of fried sushi rolls...which is exactly what this hungover girl was craving anyway.

Albacore with crispy onions ..Yum
Salmon nigiri...Yum
Shrimp tempura roll...Yum
some kind of bulgogi roll..Yum
and some other specialty roll, can't remember...

Everything I had was delcious and fresh....service was fast and friendly and I felt happy here...the hangover required that I be around only a few people and the HardRock was totally over crowded...

They are open super late for those like me who crave things late at night!"}
{"text":"I was so skeptical, as I am a total buffet girl when it comes to Vegas.  I've heard any other ethnic cuisine in Vegas is absolutely disgusting... but this place proved me incorrect.  The baked scallops in their sauce was so good.  No words can describe it.  We walked over (not a great idea, but we were hungry and didn't want to wait in the cab line) from Hard Rock after partying it up at Center Bar (awesome time too) and ate there at 4:30 in the morning.  I especially liked the cheers we got when we walked in, looking awesome I'm sure, after a night of excessive drinking and partying.  The place is a like a club that serves sushi.  There is a deejay spinning tunes and with the exception of the sushi bar, most of the restaurant is dark.  The food though, was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"I went in here for lunch. The place was quiet and I sat at the bar. The sushi chef was quick with producing the order. They even have fresh wasabi. Maybe it was because it wasn't busy, but I felt they were a little over attentive. Having people constantly on me for refills or taking plates detracted from the sushi experience. Additionally, one of the staff was hitting Youtube for the music videos playing on the big screen.  Pay for Youtube Red at least so the advertisements don't jar the customers, again detracting from the experience.

Food - 5 stars
Cleanliness - 5 stars
Service - Exceptional but over whelming - 3 stars
Ambiance - Youtube adds - 3 stars"}
{"text":"ok this review may have been blurred by my inebriation as well as my company at the time, but it was a damn fine experience.

what better than hot tea, cold sake and fresh sushi at 5am after a silly night of drinking?  i never thought sushi was a good late night food, but i guess anything can when its that late.  yeah, this place is open till 6am on the weekends.  this whole concept intrigued me.  i didn't even mind hearing the new britney cd in its entirety...

for our dinner (breakfast?) she had a house salad with some wild dressing i sampled that was very good.  the best roll we ordered was some scallop roll served in a sauce of curry with mushrooms...awesome.  i deducted one star b/c i was very excited for the korean bbq roll (i'm a huge, huge fan of short ribs) and it didn't do anything for me, too chewy for a roll...was terribly disappointed.  otherwise, food was excellent.

the hot tea was good, i don't know why i drank more but the sake after a whole night of drinking was strangely appealing.  

like i said, i ate up this whole experience.  the newest fan of sushi and sake at 6am!"}
{"text":"Great sushi...happy hour is great and staff is funny and friendly and let's the customers create their own sushi :)"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good place to eat sushi, and this one had pleasant reviews by my fellow Yelpers. 
It is located in a plaza with other restaurants, a 24/7 salon, and retail stores. 
I love the ambiance and customer service. They are attentive and helpful. Nicely decorated with elegant simplicity. 

We ordered the avocado train, spicy rainbow roll, and the baked scallop. All in all, we were speechless the whole time we were eating because it was that good! The avocado train had a delightful surprise with an avocado ball at the end of the roll. What is in it, you ask? You gotta order it and find out! The spicy rainbow roll was a good balance of spicy and fresh fish. Lastly I love the sauce on the baked scallop roll. The mushroom and scallops were super good! 

Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding and the sushi was good. The rolls are good and creative. If you like spicey with sushi this place will treat you well. It also has basic rolls but their own spicey creations are good. Also got the the gyoza, after living in Japan for three years wasn't inpressed with the gyoza. Decent but if you come and are looking for an appetizer I wouldnt go with this one, but nonetheless the food and sushi and service was good, so I would check it out if you're jonzing for a cool place and some good food."}
{"text":"We went here after a very late night on the strip. Right off the strip, and uber ride was very cheap so location was amazing. Walking into a place at 3AM, you would expect a place to look like dirty and run down. This place was the complete opposite. Very nice and very clean. We're helped right away and given some suggestions and their best sellers. Their menu is so BIG. We just went with what was suggested. Some of their maki rolls were not traditional but they were very good. I enjoyed my meal as did the rest of my party. Highly suggest this place if are out late and are craving Japanese cuisine. Also they have unlimited passion fruit ice tea!!

Would I return to the place?
Most definitely. This place exceeded expectations"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Will come back again. Must try the Jay roll and the tatami roll. Came here all the way from LA."}
{"text":"Almost all of my sushi experiences these days are AYCE, so it was nice to go out for a few rolls and know I didn't have to prep for stuffing myself. Prices are definitely high given Kaizen's proximity to the Hard Rock Hotel and ordering two rolls will easily set you back for more than a typical AYCE dinner. However, I do think the quality of ingredients is better, the rolls are thicker, and there's a little more effort put in to justify at least some of the price. 

The restaurant is hip and modern despite its Strip Mall location. There's weren't many customers on a Tuesday night but it did look like most of them were tourists. We sat at the bar and ordered the Shishito Pepper appetizer to start. I was surprised by how many peppers they gave us. They were served with bonito flakes on the side, which I wasn't quite sure what to do with. Do I eat them on top of the peppers? Between bites of the peppers? I ended up drizzling soy sauce on the flakes and eating them with the peppers, making it easier to stick together. We also ordered the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna (always a favorite), Katana Roll, and TT Girl Roll. The Katana had just the right amount of heat and the sauce served with it tasted like Cool Ranch Doritos. I do think it was ranch based, and I never knew how well ranch goes with sushi, though what doesn't go well with ranch...? My boyfriend enjoyed the T.T. Girls roll, I liked the eel on top but thought it was a little too saucy. 

Overall a pleasant experience at Kaizen. Don't go in thinking you have to eat like you would at an AYCE place. It was a lot of food and I was thoroughly satiated at the end of the meal. This is certainly a cheaper option than eating at Nobu at HRH, but if you're trying to really get down on some sushi and don't care too much about quality or ambiance, there are plenty of AYCE sushi spots just behind UNLV that may serve your wallet and appetite better."}
{"text":"This was a great local find when I was staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and didn't have a car. It's right across the street in an unassuming strip mall. (Plenty of free parking if you're driving, btw!) I was impressed with the hip, modern and clean design. Definitely wasn't expecting this place to be that stylish. 

The hostess was friendly and seated me right away. She also was my server and was very on top of things. The prices are about average, but not as ridiculous as the casino sushi places. The best deal I found was the chicken katsu bowl, which was around $10. It was the most delicious katsu I had in a long time. It was moist and the serving size was perfect. I hate when katsu is dried out and tough, but this definitely wasn't the case here. I had a good miso soup and a roll too. I can't remember the name of the roll, but it delicious. The fish was fresh and the sauce complimented it perfectly. My server came by several times to check on me and refill my beverages. All in all, I had a great experience and I will definitely be back. Saw lots of good dishes going by that I would like to try next time! But, trust me, try the chicken katsu!"}
{"text":"Whack. 

The food was decent, but nothing was that memorable.  I would've liked my salmon skin salad to be crispy. 

The bad service overshadowed the experience there. The wait to get change for the bill must have taken over 15 minutes. It's not like my friends and I had a complicated bill either, we paid in cash.

The Mexican bar after the Indian restaurant next door is much better than this place."}
{"text":"Not cheap but very good. Good sake selection. Creative dishes. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"There are a few times in life where you stumble across a little gem. I just had this experience. I'm a sushi aficionado and going to the many sushi places I've been to, this one rates at the top! Beautifully presented yet so delicious you can't stop ordering another roll. I highly recommend this place and their 'Sexy Roll' and 'Rose Roll'. Pure genius. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My previous Vegas trip on Aug 2010 a group of my friends (living in Sin and HI) and I came here. And being from Hawaii we are exposed to excellent sushi, so I already knew I wouldn't find it as high-quality as I would back home. BUT it actually was pretty decent. The prices where very reasonable to for how good, big and fresh it was.

I tried the \"First Kiss\" being raved about from my friends which was exactly what they claimed. I also tried the salmon and hamachi negiri. 

I'll be sure to hit this spot up again on this years Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"My favorite local sushi place in Vegas. Avoid the big names on the strip - this place is just as good at half the price. All the locals know this place and hang out here.

This is one of the few sushi places I know of that have a Fried Banana Roll. At less than $10, the roll is ridiculously well priced and delicious. Which brings me to my next point - the prices. 

The prices are extremely reasonable. They have their roll with all the bells and whistles at $13-$16 a roll, but with a plethora of well-topped rolls at or less than $10, it's a bargain. Quality is top notch, and this is coming from a guy who lives in LA. 

Drop by here and grab yourself some sushi (did I mentioned they're open until 6am on Fridays and Saturdays? Insanely convenient, I know)"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine turned me on to this place...was pretty skeptical at first but was pretty satisfied at the end of the meal which was at 5 am!! The DJ was still spinning and the chefs were still grooving and making my custom made sushi!! Can't complain now can I ? :-) You have to have the King Crab Miso Soup as a starter!! The Jalapeno poppers are great along with the rainbow roll and the lobster rolls! Yummy!!! :-)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, and each time loved this place.  Quality is excellent, and the platting is nice.  My only criticism is that either the tables are too high or the chairs are too low ..... when I eat there I feel like I was back in 1st grade sitting at a desk made for middle-schoolers.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Recently went here again and it was just as good. I can't get enough of this place! I love that they have a DJ (I don't know if that's a regular thing, I was there at about 12 on a Saturday). The place is open until 6 am on Saturday, which is awesome. It's a really fun place to go and they make the sushi pretty quickly. We ordered the Hawaiian roll (it's very different than it is at other places), the baked salmon roll, 1 oyster shooter, and the Rainbow roll (the total was $45..not too bad). And of course it was all very delicious."}
{"text":"I go to Kaizen Sushi about once a week and I love their food I recommend anybody looking for a good sushi place to go there and their prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"It's pretty disheartening that I've had my favorite roll, to date, a thousand miles from home. 

Went to Vegas in March and stayed at the Hard Rock. The fella and I had a craving for sushi, and found Kaizen in the strip mall right across the street. We strolled over and proceeded to order an obscene amount of food. Everything was good, until we got the Kiss of Fire, which was AMAZING! Nevermind that we already scarfed down 3 rolls, tempura, edamame, and nigiri  - we HAD to have another one. That good.

The atmosphere here was nice. Clean, modern, bright. The service was great. The price was definitely reasonable. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be there pretty consistently. 

Seriously. Go. And if you don't order the Kiss of Fire - you're just dumb."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi restaurant. Visiting Vegas for the first time and loving it. The chicken katsu bowl is delicious. Ask for a side of eel sauce to make it 10x better"}
{"text":"Had Korean BBQ bento box at lunch it was awesome. The miso soup was tasty, salad crisp dressing was killer and the BBq was as tender as filet mignon, cut it with a fork (yes I used a Fork). Portions were large as well. Service was excellent and very friendly. Korean BBQ is one of my favorites, I've eaten it all over the world including Korea and I've never had better."}
{"text":"While visiting LV, my friends and I really wanted to eat some sushi. The first place we \"found\" seemed to either not be open or no longer in business, but just our luck Kaizen was right across the street. They have a fun atmosphere and a sizable menu. I couldn't decide what to pick!  I chose a few interesting rolls, and they were very good. 

Good job Kaizen!"}
{"text":"Great menu! Welcoming vibes and heard nothing but amazing reviews from friends and family! Food came out in a timely manner. Fresh fish and great food. Amazing service and super accommodating! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Kaizen has a pretty big selection of rolls, and some quite different from other places in town. They also have a great spicy garlic edamame which was hot and fantastic! I would definitely like to try more of the rolls as I like the unusual ones. I would need a few more tries to see if I might become more of a regular here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Love coming to this place. Love the orange blossom roll!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Kies in sushi roll for a late night by Irene is a great waitress and she will take care of you especially after midnight. She is a great hostess and waitress and will take care of all your friends and family's needs. Excellent customer service and beautiful scenery."}
{"text":"For a hip sushi restaurant with very cool decor and most importantly DELICIOUS  food that won't break the bank, Kaizen is perfect!  

Everything I've eaten there so far is soooo yummy~  They have your typical rolls but they've also got a great selection of different things too.  There's this crispy rice appetizer that's topped with spicy tuna a drop of hot sauce that is something so simple but great.  That's just one of many tasty treats there.

At the end of every meal though I've always got to finish with the tempura green tea ice cream. =D

I've brought my friends here and now it's a one of our regulars we always eat at.  Great food, ambience, service.....you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere, but that's about it. I know it's a fusion restaurant, but I'm not sure what's they're fusing. I didn't order any sushi, maybe the sushi would be better. I'd ordered the teriyaki beef bowl. It just taste like pei wei's food. We also got a udon...however we didn't know they had stir-fry. I thought udon was going to be in a soup. The flavoring of the udon tasted like the vietnamese saracha chilli sauce mixed with sweet and sour sauce. Absolutely gross.  Maybe their sushi rolls are better, but I think they'd overpriced their food and you could get better sushi at other place for better price."}
{"text":"Bento boxes are cheap for lunch special!:) food looks good though. Nice ambiance. Desserts are great! Good customer service."}
{"text":"This is another late nite, post-partying on the Vegas strip spot!
It's funny because I have never eaten sushi @ 2am before!!!
And it was so yummy!
I especially enjoyed the bulgogi roll and Sexy roll.
So if you are craving a late-nite sushi, check this spot out because they close @ 6am!!!
YaY!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi and Sashimi, great atmosphere and open until 4am!?! Best Sushi restaurant I've ever been to in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The service is crazy fast and the polar opposite of \"chatty\"...which I liked. The rolls were tasty and there is a huge selection. Really, the only thing they could improve is to get fountain drinks. I'm annoyed by paying $2.50 for a can of Coke that obviously is not refillable. We were seriously blown away by how fast they got our food out to us."}
{"text":"I love good sushi and sashimi. Fresh, the right temp, reasonable portions. I like to taste the fish, not have it hidden and smothered in sauces. 

Kaizen is a great place to go in Vegas. With so many choices in town, this place is a great place to enjoy quality sushi and sashimi. The food is spot on, and the prices are reasonable. The vibe is open and bright. They have the little things like fresh wasabi and know the difference between sushi rice and steamed rice."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd night in a row. The food was delicious and service was top notch. We will be back for sure. We eat the salmon steak and udon. Both dish were tasty."}
{"text":"If you are in Las Vegas and want to have sushi in unpretentious place, then try Kaizon on Paradise. The last time I was here it wasn't so good but because of Leo...... it is much better. Give it a try and ask for Leo as you sushi chef."}
{"text":"It was freaking awesome! Really was some of the tastiest and freshest sushi I've ever had. Try the Shogun roll. The tempura was cooked to perfection, and the accompanying apple sake was a showstopper."}
{"text":"So I have a bone to pick - W and I walked through the front doors that had a huge sign saying \"LUNCH SPECIALS *EVERY DAY*!\" When we asked the waitress about the lunch specials, she said there weren't any lunch specials because of CES. If you're going to do that, take that sign out on the front. Otherwise, it's just dishonest, and super irritating.

Ordered to share: miso soup, rock and roll, silver state roll, and the scallop volcano roll. Scallop volcano roll was def the fave and hope to find something at home like it."}
{"text":"First time here. Really nice atmosphere. Great sushi! I highly recommend the fire cracker roll."}
{"text":"eh.
way too expensive for the mediocrity of the sushi.
there are SO many better places to choose from."}
{"text":"I am no sushi expert, but both my brother and I agree that this may have been the best sushi roll we have had and not a bad price. The service was great as well, I drink a lot of water and my glass never even got empty."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Nice quiet spot off the strip, and with off-the-strip prices. Went twice during a week-long work trip there and it was a nice respite from the pretention and BS elsewhere in Vegas. The rolls were inventive and terrific, with good quality fish. I sat at the sushi bar both times and found the sushi chefs to be friendly and knowledgeable, and struck up a wonderful hour-long conversation with a fellow solo customer that lasted well after our food was done."}
{"text":"On my moms this shit smack. I got a Hawaiian roll. It was solid. It had the texture of tuna but it was abalone. The service was a1. My cup was neva empty you feel me."}
{"text":"This is defiantly one of the best sushi places in Las Vegas. Always consistently delicious sushi. I come twice a year for a trade show and I don't miss this place. I look forward to having sushi at Kaizen. The crispy rice is one of the best I've tasted ever. And also the spicy tuna salad is my favorite. 
I live in LA where sushi is king. Thus place is better than any place in LA. A must gem close to Hard Rock Hotel. Serving is always spot on."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious sushi walking distance from the Hard Rock Hotel. Extremely affordable price. I've been here over a dozen time in the last couple years. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour - amazing decor and prices. Do yourself a favor and get off the strip for dinner!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends who were in town staying on the strip wanted sushi and since I am a local and have a car I demanded we leave the strip and go here. We ordered the avocado train roll, the unicorn and another I don't remember the name of... But let me just say not only was the presentation of the rolls great, the flavor was amazing! They were beyond happy with this place which made me feel good. The venue is clean and I really like the set up. Some intimate tables on the side but the middle has big long benches for a unique seating expierence. Would be great for a big group! The server was incredibly friendly and helpful with his suggestions for what we should order. I am looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"No all you can eat. This ones for the tourists. If you want all the sushi you can eat for 25$ go to spring mountain road. Good sushi here, but you get as much as you want anywhere else in vegas. Don't be fooled!

Go go all you can eat!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've ever been to in the U.S. I was skeptical at first with reading some of these reviews. Im so glad I listened to my daughter and came. It was her birthday so her wish. We ate the Unicorn Roll, Orange Blossom, and the T something girls roll. Delicious!!! And highly recommended. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Holy mackerel... I was not expecting this dining experience. Just arrived from LA to visit my grandparents for the holiday, got out of the care home way later than expected, hotel check-in was a mess, all the boyfriend and I felt like was sushi. It was 10:30 and everything was about to close at 11. We gave up on the \"epic Vegas dining experience\" and just picked the highest rated sushi joint on yelp that was open. Some place in a strip mall. (Eyebrow raised)

Just upon walking in, we were shocked to see and feel such a nice and trendy vibe. Clean, classy, good music, nice bar, neat tables. We sat at the bar and opened the fabulously photographed menus. Sushi spots with photos is a major plus for me and they had EVERYTHING photographed. We picked a bunch of stuff and were blown away with not only the taste/freshness/quality of fish, but the presentation, price/portions, service... Just everything. The bill ended up being $122 and trust me... we were really going for it. Anywhere else back in LA would have racked up to $200+. 

We stayed and hung out well after we were stuffed to the brim. The ambiance is nice and I felt like I was getting a special type of Vegas experience without all the hustle and bustle. I will absolutely be showing this place off to friends who join me on future trips. What a treat!

Oh yeah... And it's open until 6am. AND they have a happy hour that starts at midnight. GENIUS!!!

I posted photos of what we ate - albacore topped with fried onions, filet mignon salad, white rose roll, sea bass & unagi. We also had saki bombs, the largest portion of edemami ever, uni and crispy tuna tostada things. YUM YUMMMMM YUM"}
{"text":"Consistently solid sushi spot. A little pricey given its just like any other sushi resturaunt (you cant really fuck up sushi for me lol). We did notice the sashimi we ordered was warm? Room temperature is appropriate but it being warm kind of sketched us out a bit... The fish could be fresher, but overall I enjoyed Kaizen, just as I usually do. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after Yama Sushi had an 50 minute wait! The decor reminded me of a nightclub. We ordered Gyoza and an assortment of other sushi rolls. The service was pretty good.  All of the rolls were pretty good, but the real standout was Japanese lasagna. it tasted different from Sushi-mon's or even Yama's because it tasted more like it should be called 'Japanese Mac N Cheese'. it was refreshing and interesting tasting. 
The Gyoza was not as awesome. I'm not a fan of deep-fried gyoza.
This place definitely hit the spot for my sushi craving. However upon leaving the restaurant i realized it wasn't the same as Yama sushi. Still good, but not the same."}
{"text":"This isn't my first time eating at kaizen but decided to do a review. I love their food here. It bums me they no longer do all you can. I remember the last I went they do all you can eat. I don't know if it was seasonal. But my favorite entrees here would have to be the baked salmon or the beef teriyaki. The serving fills me up. Other than that, I do love their baked rolls. I would definitely recommend the baked lasagna. Super duper good. If you're into tempura roll I would recommend the crazy boy roll. 8 pieces for only 7 bucks! I love the eel sauce. The food is great overall. For service wise, it's fair. You'll have the good waiters and sometimes the bad ones."}
{"text":"This place is located right across the street from HR hotel ( home of trendy Nobu). We come here when we have a larger group or a mixed group who like a wide range Japanese food. The fish is very fresh and some really good non traditional rolls for those who like them, The atmosphere is casual, the staff very friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some late dinner encouraged by the reviews here but still skeptical. I sat at the end of the sushi bar so I could watch the food being prepared. I was impressed with the care and attention to detail. I asked for an eel hand roll which was made quickly and well. I decided to try one of their crazy fusion rolls and ordered the Unicorn. All the ingredients came together well and the slightly spicy, slightly vinegary sauce really added some kick and acid while letting all the flavors of the fish and shrimp and lobster come through. Staff was friendly, attentive and efficient. Prices were reasonable. Overall I would definitely come here again and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Vegas .. And one of my personal favorites .. Everything tastes on point with good quality Service and friendly staff !! The satisfy my sushi cravings!!"}
{"text":"let's start with the food. wtf, so every piece of sushi I picked up break apart before hitting my mouth. I ended up with a soup of ell sauce and rice. second, the service, two servers working together and after ordering more food ( at this point I was so hungry and it was late, I wasn't leaving) so dude takes my order and joy, oh sweet joy. comes by asks if I needed anything. I replied , no I'm good thnx. she comes back with a check. at this point I had to point out there's more food coming. haha I was like wow. not to mention that I asked for a bottle of fiji and she placed it on the table after a few minutes I go and pour it and it was frozen, I mean not a drop can squeeze out. like can you not tell the damn thing is swollen and frozen and she was like \" I'm sorry the busser must of left it in the freezer\" I'm thinking... didn't you notice? probably she just didn't care.
This placed my left nut and joy sucked my right. so at the end of the day, I guess I left happy. lol
I definitely don't recommend it and suggest for them to work on service and their sushi chef's or people pretending, really need to get training or start giving a shit. 
two thumbs down. never again."}
{"text":"While I was in Vegas for my friends birthday, we decided to get some sushi. This place came up when I searched, \"all you can eat sushi.\" Sadly, it wasn't. But we stayed and gave it a shot. 

The service was awesome. Our waitress was friendly and patient with all 7 of us. We ordered a variety of rolls, and every single one of them was delicious. 

They also had some late happy hour, which is after 12am, and it's buy one get one free.

Very clean place as well. 

Give it shot!"}
{"text":"Total quality management.

Look it up: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Kaizen

Edamame and cold tofu with ponzu both delivered.

Mountain of salted goodness on the former, rectangles of soybean with sweet homemade ponzu sauce on the latter. Loved both.

Rolls were massive if unmemorable. Rainbow featured an assortment of fish, Mackerel Madness was pretty mad with mackerel and more ponzu sauce.

Yet a week later not much stands out from either.

Reasonably priced and a space that tries to be as cool as possible.

Call it three stars for reaching middle management."}
{"text":"What a fun little sushi joint. While we were in Vegas for the long weekend, we had a late night (2am) craving for dinner and of course, almost nothing was still open except buffets and Kaizen sushi. Score one for the sushi joint. A taxi driver recommended the spot to me and I have to say he was on point.

Walking in, it's a small place. But the decor is warm and inviting, as are the staff. They were playing music videos and tables full of people appeared to be having a great time doing sake bombs. 

Their menu is HUGE. It's almost near impossible to make a choice based on all the yummy pictures and descriptions. But I settled on the Japanese steak and veggies (yummy shiitake mushrooms) and my friend ordered the albacore and the beef tataki (sp?) The food was so delicious that even as we stuffed ourselves silly, we made sure to wrap up the leftovers and take them back to the room. 

The price was affordable, service was quick, knowledgable and friendly, and they called us a cab to go back to the room. And did I mention they're open until 3am? Kudos. I'm definitely a fan and will return next time I'm in Sin City."}
{"text":"Oh my. I can't gush enough about this place. It's across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. We were craving sushi while gambling there and almost went to Nobu. Thankful for checking Yelp we came here instead to save a few bucks. I can't tell you how happy I am that I came here! We had the Kaizen cheviche which was heaven. Then we had the Kaizen scallop dynamite which is baked with mushrooms and cheese. I would have ordered another had we not ordered rolls. I'm a scallop fan and this was just mouth-watering good! The prices are reasonable and I'll admit I'd pay Nobu prices for this deliciousness. Don't be fooled by those high end places. Come to a local spot like this and have a great meal!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that this open late, so when you just heading out from a vegas show and in the mood for a hot ramen, this is the place to go! Fast service and food is great!!!"}
{"text":"This is a new spot that we will come to when we come to Vegas! The food was sooo good! The eel bowl was so good, the hungry roll and philidelphia roll was great too! Everything tasted fresh. The waiters are attentive but don't know if because there were only 3 guest here on a Sunday but none the less great staff. If u Check in on yelp and do a review u get a free something lol explains why there are so many reviews lol great place great food and great staff:) 
If I could change just one thing it would be the can sodas, no refills. It didn't bother us mich but just maybe something we would of liked to know before ordering a soda."}
{"text":"Great sushi. The menu has a lot of different choices to choose from with all you can eat. I definitely always recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING :) 

The sushi chefs were personable, friendly and had some awesome sushi recommendations :) 

The restaurant was clean, had a great atmosphere, good bar selection and fabulous service.

Must try the avocado train and orange blossom roll"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing sushi sushi spot here in Vegas!! Definitely try the KISS OF FIRE ROLL, my favorite. Great staff, great service and the restaurant is beautiful. We came here every time we're in town."}
{"text":"It's open late, it serves sushi(meh sushi) and the prices seem to reflect the fact that it's across the street from the Hard Rock. That combination is not something that will ever make me want to come back. Not to mention all 3 of the rolls I ordered were sloppily made and didn't seem to be the freshest of fish. Pass!"}
{"text":"High quality fish, fusion cuisine. Their sushi is incredible!!! Good selection of wines.Very good service , cozy atmosphere. Expansive, but reasonable if you take into account organic ingredients. Furniture must be updated / changed as soon as possible. We go there for good food and willing to pay the price , stays open for industry till 4... give it a shot."}
{"text":"I don't yelp... but this place was so good I am sitting at the table writing how amazing the sushi is! Screw Nobu. Walk across the street!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Go weekly since we were staying nearby when we first moved here. Get the same thing every time - tempura shrimp or lobster roll and chicken katsu. And of course sake and beer. The place is lively and there is a video screen which is a bit loud, but works in this place. 

Service is excellent. We love Tom. This place is also kid friendly and my daughter's favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"First time here and came on a Saturday night and was quickly seated. Love the ambiance and the open concept.

I ordered the Baked Salmon Roll and  the tempura appetizer! The food came quickly and both were very good! I love that the rolls weren't huge where they weren't falling off which I love!! The tempura wasn't overcooked either and not too greasy! 

Lastly the service was impeccable! Everyone checked on us and always made sure our drinks were topped off! So glad we came here!! =)"}
{"text":"Living in Seattle, I'm spoiled with fresh sushi. Who knew that I would find it in Vegas too?

There are a bunch of different rolls, each drool worthy and the prices are fair. If you're a big fan of mussels, their mussels are huge!!! I love it.

The decor is modern and very spacious. The restaurant is off the strip, but totally worth the trip out there.

Also opens until very late :) aka 4am... for all you party animals you."}
{"text":"came here by accident. the  korean bbq place nearby was closed. but turns out this place aint too shabby.  i love the decor and with our big group of 15+, we sat at the long tall table by the door.  i can't review what everyone else had but my ahi tuna salad was BOMB! too bad it didn't stay in my stomach long =\

the service was good probably due to the fact that we went during lunch time when it was pretty much dead."}
{"text":"I saw the amazing reviews and really craved sushi so I came here with my mom. I hardly go to vegas so I'm not familiar with anything. Everything on the menu looked really good and sounded appetizing. Or it could've been that I was starving. We ordered a few plates. The seared salmon appetizer was way too salty. I had to tell them to take it back. And all the items on the menu was mainly tuna. Halfway eating I was starting to get sick of the smell and taste of tuna. This experience wasn't what I hoped for. If I'm ever in vegas, I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok but one of the nigiris had bone in it and we saw a bug next to our table :( the toro was 20 dollars for 2 pieces which was too much in my opinion because it didn't even taste like anything special or mind blowing. This place I believe is overpriced and overrated !!! I would've given 3 stars because the other sushi was good but service was slow and they weren't even busy that day :("}
{"text":"I love eating here. They usually have some sort of special fresh fish like tonight blue fin tuna. I don't know why more people from hard rock don't venture over here. Its way better than most of the places over there and right across the street."}
{"text":"My wife and I were their by chance. The Korean BBQ next door was closed for maintenance and we decided to grab a quick bite here. Suffice to say, we ordered Uni and it was the worst mistake we could have made. It was spoiled!! I immediately spit mine out in my napkin and my wife ended up swallowing hers out of respect and embarrassment of not making a scene. I feel very bad for her and upset with this establishment. They should have known better than to serve rotten Uni. Uni is best within three days. Their Uni must have been over a week old judging by the  texture, smell, and horrible taste from being spoiled. Well the next day my wife started feeling sick and her condition has gotten worse as the day progressed. Fever, vomit, and so on without embarrassing her more. The worst part is we were on vacation and the last day of our trip she got sick. She hasn't been able to eat all day.  I hope she gets better soon. They comped only the rotten Uni. They should have comped our whole meal and then some for what they are putting my poor wife through."}
{"text":"I don't see why people like this place so much! They have horrible service! It's seriously the service that gets them the 1 star. First of all no one was even in the front to greet you.
We ordered two hot teas and NEVER got them, but was still charged for it.
The sushi rolls were good. The food is good don't get me wrong. But the waitresses that work here don't even want to be there. 
Some other waitress that wasn't even helping us in the first place got us water. And apologized for her coworkers mistake. Wait why are you apologizing...? The Asian waitress should be apologizing. Anyways I definitely will not be coming back. Management needs to check up on this because several people are complaining about the service. 

On top of all that another customer walks I'm after us and gets his drinks and food before us? Thanks for the slap in the face.

This place has a Japanese name, but definitely Korean owned.

I suggest to order togo to avoid this situation."}
{"text":"Open really late and great sushi

I have stopped in here on numerous times to Vegas. Mainly because i get into town late and after a full day of traveling i need somewhere \"non vegas strip\" to eat and relax.

There best roll is hands down the \"sexy roll\" but ill let you be the judge cause there all good. The waitresses are nice and the place has a nice layout. Nice top 40 hits with a huge screen where they play the music video to whatever song is playing. Kinda cool to watch if you dont wanna chill at the bar and watch whatever sports game they have on."}
{"text":"One of my favorite weekday lunch spots. As a local it's hard to find a decent off strip sushi place that is good and has fair prices. They have awesome lunch specials and a hip fun environment."}
{"text":"my second time here and I will be returning. We picked up some friends from the strip who were visiting and they wanted sushi. I tried another local favorite but it was an hour wait. Kaizen was just a 30 minute wait and I'm glad we did.

The service was great. The orders were taken almost as quickly as our drinks were brought out and rolls were quick to follow. They all had excellent flavors and our out of town friends agreed we made the right selection on where to eat. Very clean and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious sushi! If you don't want to spend lots of money at the casino sushi bars or at Nobu@Hard Rock (which is across the street) go to Kaizen. They have a GREAT AMBIANCE!, cool vibe and current music/videos! They have a long sushi bar with a couple of plasma TV's where you can watch sports. The menu has many options- our favorite was the roll that had salmon, macadamia nuts, avocado and jalapeno! YUM!  DO NOT GO TO Yokohama for sushi which is diagonally across the street. I don't know why it got so many good reviews. Go to Kaizen...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very delicious food!! Try the garlic edamame ! Great ambiance and friendly staff! This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"2 rolls, a beer and a large hot sake for under $40 bucks...in Vegas...yeah. Almost unbelievable, but true.
The rolls were just ok. It was only better than fast food because it was fish and rice. Had it been coated in grease, it probably would have tasted about the same. It was just ok.
The price was fantastic - the sake was good. Cold beer is always cold beer. The waitstaff was friendly and sweet - the sushi chefs looked like they were biding their time until something better came along and you could taste it in the rolls.
It was walking distance from my hotel...a little off the beaten path from the strip... and I like this."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas and was looking for the closest sushi place to me and found this place. Sushi combo is a great deal and the fish tastes very very fresh! Great food for a great price!"}
{"text":"BOO. So disappointed.

Came here around 8 on a Saturday night after Yama's Sushi had a 30 minute wait.
Soon as we came, we were seated immediately which was good because we had a party to go to at 10.

Each of my friends ordered a hot/cooked dish and a specialty roll; I ordered the chirashi (sashimi sampler on rice) because I didn't want to be too full for the night's festivities.

In 15 mins, my friends each got their cooked meal - seafood curry, chicken katsu, and chicken teriyaki donburi. Told my friends to eat as my food was surely to come out soon.
I watched my friends eat as I drank water; and watched more and more people come into the restaurant. 
Before I knew it, my friends were done with their meals. And I started noticing that the groups of people that came after us were getting their sushi. This was about 30 mins after ordering.
We kept looking for our waitress for the next 5-10 minutes but, no one came into our section. We, finally, had to wave down the hostess to check on our sushi.

My friends' specialty rolls, finally, came. But, at that point, their food had already settled and they weren't hungry. 
Finally...after an hour of waiting, my food came. By that time, I didn't even wanna eat it.


For a city that has all these AYCE and stellar sushi spots, Kaizen should be lucky to be open. And with service like this; forget it!"}
{"text":"Food was good , service was even better. We ordered the Kai sushi roll and the Nevada roll . sushi is just typical sushi to fix your cravings ."}
{"text":"so to start this review id like to say that the manager of the company never returned my phone call but did call my brother back who threatened to call the health department on them and responded without saying sorry or taking any responsibility for not 1 but 3 of the 4 people getting sick. But instead defended their food and any possibility of it happening. Nor did he offer any sort of reconcilement. Thursday morning at 3:45am we sat down and ate with a group of 4. 1 of which only ate her 1 roll but the 3 of us shared the rest. It took 2 hours for the stomach pain to start. An hour later is when I first began throwing up and the rest of the symptoms that come with food poisoning throughout the day and through the night. I was supposed to go to the lake thursday am and had to cancel that and had surgery planned friday morning which had to be rescheduled due to the pain and weakness i had. My brother called the restaurant on paradise where we ate, he never got a call bak until the next day he called again and said he would be calling the health department as stated and only then did he get a call back. The manager brought up the idea of us drinking alocohol, mind you i didn't drink as i needed to be up for the lake. Wasnt at all apologetic for the incident only tried basically putting the blame on everything but the restaurants food. I would also like to state that i posted on my instagram story about the incident and i had not 1 but 5 others stating they had gotten sick from the same company. So as of now i will be taking this into my own hands so i can let the public know about this company. I will be contacting the news station as well."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken bowl you can't go wrong ! I may have had this dish about a dozen times . It's big very filling and extremely tasty . For the price you definitely can not go wrong ."}
{"text":"Near the strip but not on the strip.  Great sushi at a reasonable price... my 13 year old was craving sushi and our stop into Kaizen hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I would frequent this place at least once or twice a week. Any special celebrations I would tell my friends and family to go there. Anyway we came in with a party of eight and were told to wait for a table to be put together. We waited for about 20 minutes. Finally I told them we don't need to be seated together. We just need two tables. The lady said the available tables are reserved for reservations. I was like OK?!  There were six tables available and she kept insisting they are reserved for reservations. So I told the lady no worries we'll go somewhere else. She said OK bye. Which to me was funny because obviously she didn't care about customer service. We drove down a couple streets to I LOVE SUSHI. THE PLACE IS FANTASTIC!!!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi--4 stars
Service----2.5-3 stars

Customer service is questionable.   We waited about 50 min for a table although we were told 15 min.  Don't order wine here.  Stick with beer or sake or soda.  She paid $13 for a GLASS of wine which sells at Costco for $8 A BOTTLE.  The person who settled our check didnt split the bill among the card but charged one person the balance.  It was really a mess and there were only 5 people in our party.  I would return but will keep these things in mind."}
{"text":"Ate here last night. It was pretty good. I had the spicy tuna crispy rice, the fire cracker roll, and the Crispy soft shell crab appetizer. The spicy tuna crispy rice was very good. and the firecracker roll was great as well. I wasnt a big fan of the crispy soft shell crab. I usually am, but this one had a pretty heavy batter on it much like the cheap frozen breaded shimp you can buy at the grocery store. Overall it was pretty good, and the staff was very friendly. They were out of large Sapporos, so they brought me 2 small ones...at the same time...I probably looked like a lush double fisting it in a sushi bar, but I dont mind that. :)
The menu had alot of very interesting and different combinations of sushi that I'll have to go back and try sometime. I'd recommend it if you are looking for a semi-modern take on sushi.

PS. I went to the one off of Eastern and Horizon ridge...not the one by on Paradise."}
{"text":"Kaizen Is not the cheapest sushi spot out there but the service and quality of the food makes up for the price. They're happy hour is on every night from 10pm to 2am and If you go on they're website you can print out a coupon to get a free Saki Bomb with a purchase of 15 dollars or more."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this sushi! I can't always dine in so it is good to know you can call in an order and pick it up, easy peesy! The food is fresh, the service is fantastic, and it is a great place to take people visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Rolld here are super good and service was great! They had shishito peppers and chili oil which not a lot of sushi restaurants have nowadays. We came here late after a night out and they were open until 3am :)."}
{"text":"Huge variety of sushi! The people working there are very helpful and energetic. The food was amazing as well! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ok let start off that this place is probably where they invented sushi and the Japanese stole the idea from this establishment can't tell you how many times I go to this place everytime I go to Vegas but the amount of different sushi rolls they have are very unique

Happy Hour on drinks start at midnight Monday through Thursday and it's the best place to go and get budget stuff I do my sake bombs and then head out to the club after

Here are the things I tried so far
Bbq roll - out of this world"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi.  I love coming back here everytime I am in Vegas!  The Baked Mussels for Appetizers are delicious.  Will order again when we come back.  Everything you order here takes great and the service is fast and very good!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The way it's decorated gives it a really nice ambiance. The vibe made us wanna stay there longer just to chill. The service was great. And of course the sushi was fresh and delicious! The portions are big and the presentation is excellent."}
{"text":"Great staff, and the shogun roll was delicious. This place made a great impression on Vegas sushi!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the most delicious halibut dinner with roasted veggies I have ever had. Very attentive waitstaff nice atmosphere and we were able to watch the Olympics on a large screen TV. Really exceptional food--would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"lunch was  okay the service isn't the best the lady kept confusing me when i tried to order a bento box"}
{"text":"Across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel, this place is totally convenient and super yummy. They have a ton of fun rolls to share, including a few no-rice rolls that low carb LA-eaters interested in drinking their calories in Vegas can appreciate (myself included).

Of course, I recommend the HARD ROCK ROLL and the SPICY TUNA SALAD that has huge chucks of tuna and nice, light dressing."}
{"text":"Kaizen on Paradise Rd is great. I like there Japanese Tai and the Blue Fin Toro melts in my mouth. The price is good compared to the strip restaurants. Must come try this place out"}
{"text":"Staff is really attentive and friendly. Food was amazing, great options. I'm a vegan so I have to shoehorn that in here somewhere, because vegan. Also crossfit. Good food, good vibes.  10/10 would go Kaizen."}
{"text":"First Kiss Roll is delicious and service is very attentive. Open late for all you night owls. I come here sometimes twice a week! I would also try the green apple saki ..."}
{"text":"We visit this sushi spot every time we come to Vegas. It is our go to for sushi and with good reason, their food is fabulous! I sadly didn't take any pictures because I totally thought I had reviewed this spot before. 

   I definitely recommend it. I always the white rose roll, Tako sashimi, and the tempura green tea ice cream. I did order additional items this time, the unicorn roll and a tempura appetizer. 

   The unicorn roll was good. The tempura was not the best I've had, but I've been to Japan comparatively, and not a lot of tempura here meets that quality. Not all tempura is created equal! Lol. 

   Our group ordered probably about 5 or 6 other rolls that everyone shared and nothing was disappointing. This place always delivers and they're open super late night. 

  Another biggie is their fish quality! It's great, never any questions or concerns about freshness."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas, I make it a point to eat at Kaizen!!! Food is always delicious and menu is 14 pages! Best of all, happy hour is 10 pm to 4am! Buy 1 get 1 free alcohol! Love the service too!!!!"}
{"text":"I must point out that I did not have any sushi here! So in order for this place to get a fair and unbiased opinion on their food,  do not count on this review. 

I came here simply because I was staying across the street at HRH and it was a walking distance for a drunk person. I got tired of burgers and pizzas, and I wanted something different. This place had teriyaki bowls at $8.95 a bowl. It wasn't a restaurant quality teriyaki bowl as I expected. Infact I have had way better ones in Socal at mom and pop places. However I m must say I do like the ambiance of this place. They got a sports bar style counter setup with some flat  screens. And behind the bar were the chefs making sushi on the fly. If I was into Sushi, I would definitely come here.  I was just so hammered that day where raw fish would've been a trip killer.  

This place is definitely worth checking out if you need a good walking distance munchies spot from the HRH."}
{"text":"Was there last nite. Friend took me to this place for a light dinner. The food was great and the price was reasonable. He has some sushi and steak and the screaming salad was delicious. Your money is worth at this place. Not to crowded maybe because it's a Thursday but no doubt I really enjoyed the food. Thanks for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi bar in Las Vegas! Open all night (I think until 5 or 6 AM!  Very friendly, cool atmoshphe3re, great music and of course FANTASTIC fresh sushi! I have been here several times and it never disappoints. In a good area across from Hard Rock. Reasonable prices, great drinks... the only thing I would suggest is that they put seat cushions on the middle tables... they are cool but seats are hard!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem across from the hard rock! Fresh sushi and amazing mochi! Please stop in if you can! So chill and relaxing in here with great food and people."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in town. I highly recommend the Rose roll.  And the staff is the coolest ever. Each visit to Vegas I bring my guest and we're never disappointed.  Thank you rocking sushi!"}
{"text":"Good, not great, food with absolutely horrendous service. Greatly improved service could bump it to four stars, and having just one more server might do it.

Enjoyed the food, but the terribly inattentive service was inexcusable."}
{"text":"What they lack in customer service they definitely make up for with ambience and the quality of the food they serve the presentation isn't bad also"}
{"text":"This sushi house has a relaxed atmosphere, fresh sushi, and good service. I will be back for sure. Thanks for the free roll!"}
{"text":"Good -  The food is excellent.
Bad  _  service is terrible.  Lunchtime service would be better if I went to the kitchen to get it  myself.  wait staff obviously has little training.
              Ask for hot tea and you might wait 20 minutes.

Ugly  - Showed up 12:26 went in the open door and was told by the bartender(Bruskly)  to leave because they were not open yet... (Opening posted on door was 12:30???)"}
{"text":"Beware of 24 hour sushi places - even in Vegas.  Tried to give us something that was supposed to be tempura shrimp but was actually panko then redid with the same veggies which came out overdone.  Forgot the chicken karaagi - then when it finally came out when we were done it was these odd little pieces, NOT karaagi.  Take heed."}
{"text":"I can say only amazing!

 The food SOOOOOOOOO fresh, 
  The please Extra clean, they all on top of what they need to do! 
EXCELLENT service!!!!
 
 Food ready Extra fast, the hand roll is HUGE it's 3 times bigger then any hand roll I've seen.

Highly recomend"}
{"text":"I am staying at the Hard Rock hotel so the walk is not bad at all, it's right across the street so it is convenient. The place is really nice and cute with modern decor. The service was really good and everyone was really polite and friendly. I ordered the Kai roll and BBQ short ribs, which was really good. I would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is a most pleasant surprise! It's in a little strip mall, a 5 min walk from Hard Rock and The Alexis. Quick, friendly, attentive staff. I like the layout and how they compartmentalized the \"booths\". Food comes quick. Quality sushi so good i had to order same thing twice (snow white roll, YUM) cos my bf devoured the first plate even before he got his own (banana roll). One thing i really liked is that the rolls were tight so things aren't falling around the plate. 
This place makes me think we've been to the wrong places! Lol"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. My udon was hot and tasty. The monkey brain perfectly prepared and the service super friendly."}
{"text":"Just go. Just eat here. Sushi is delicious, the atmosphere is super lax, & the service is good."}
{"text":"If you love fusion rolls, this is the place.  Mind you I've only been here once during my trip to Vegas but it was definitely unforgettably delicious.  We only got rolls so I can't say much about their other food.  However, the maki (rolls) were very creative and well combined ingredients.  It isn't cheap but definitely worth the money IMO.  

I would come back here next time I am in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Definetly would recommend this place for tempura rolls. staff is friendly. came here outta the blue and wasnt dissappointed."}
{"text":"Snow White is super good! Fav sushi spot! The ayce is really worth the money and you just gotta check this place out! I go every chance I get"}
{"text":"Awesome spot to get late night sushi off the strip! My large and rowdy group of friends rolled in around 2:30am with late night sushi cravings. Sorry we were so loud! Wait staff was great in accommodating this very rude group of friends. If your friends yell very loud inappropriate sexual things that may or may not disturb the other diners, this place will still not kick you out! Believe me, they are great! 

Do not under any circumstances order the baked scallops or some roll with jalape√±os on top of it! Both my friends said those two items were gross. However, the roll I ordered that has ponzu sauce on it was delicious and I heard the Poke is phenomenal so could be hit or miss. The menu has excellent pictures so you can use your best judgement to make the right decision. Although, making right decisions and being in Las Vegas usually don't go together."}
{"text":"We came in at 6 on a Friday night and sat at the bar, had excellent service, everything was amazing. Started with the salmon and yellowtail nigiri and an order of egg rolls. Both cuts were super fresh, melt in your mouth type sushi. Then we went to the rolls, had a Tokyo and Bing roll. Amazing! Topped it off with dessert, or as we do....another salmon nigiri! Definitely recommend for anyone staying in hard rock or the Hyatt."}
{"text":"Kaizen is at a great location. We came because it was very close to our hotel after we got to Las Vegas after midnight, and it was surprisingly amazing! (So I decide to give my first yelp review ever)

The staff was really nice and friendly, he recommended us the avocado train and a few other rolls which were all great. The fish was pretty fresh and the sauce was delicious! Highly recommend the avocado train if you're a big fan of avocado :)

They also had happy hour which we could buy one drink and get another free :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and let me just say, avoid on Saturday nights at all costs. The atmosphere is awful, a trashy crowd lingers and don't forget the extremely loud and cheesy music, its uncomfortable for anyone wanting a dinner where you don't feel like you are in a college-esque nightclub. The hostess couldn't be any ruder either, saying we couldn't get our food at the bar, and then she changed her mind after we were seated at a table- its like we are at a sushi bar at a strip mall not the Queen of Englands quarters, no need for the snobbery. Anyways, the sushi chefs are awesome and very friendly, and any other day or time is great to grab a bite to eat here, they also have Saketinis that are soooo adorable and delicious."}
{"text":"Your korean bbq is the bomb! It's very delicious! I enjoyed eating here! Very modernized!"}
{"text":"First time trying a sushi place out in Vegas! Green chili tempura is super good highly recommend trying out this place if your in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Came to kaizen with my mom while visiting Vegas. Our friends suggested we try kaizen because they love it. I'm vegetarian and they were very accommodating. The sushi roll i created was amazing and the garlic edamame was delicious. They service was very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back our next time in town."}
{"text":"Those is our goto place for sushi in Vegas.  You can walk across the street from Hard Rock.  Great rolls, great sushi.  Cooked foods are great too.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!! I'm never coming back here again! Our server sucked, he was rude and extremely unprofessional. We were a party of 6, out food took forever and when we complained about it, an employee who claimed to be the owner, yelled at us!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavors here, ordered a few rolls and wished we would've found this place earlier in our trip!  Try anything with eel, one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"First, I have to thank Mary P. for this suggestion.  Actually, she suggested the location in North Las Vegas. But still glad I came here. 

I was staying at the Hard Rock and wanted some sushi. Had Hamada's 2 nights prior (see review) and it was horrible. Had to redeem myself.

Service:  Tons of staff to the point that you will always have someone at your needs.  Good job Team Kaizen.

Now for the food.  Tried their Spicy Tuna, Chicken Katsu w/Brown Rice, Baked Salmon,and Caterpillar Roll.  All were tasty, fresh, not fishy, and made to order. My co-worker had a special roll created exactly how he wanted it.  Always good when they can improvise. 

Can't wait to try the location in North Las Vegas.  Only issue with this place is that they lack AYCE. But they stated they were better than the north location.  We'll see, I will be the judge"}
{"text":"This is a great place, nice atmosphere! I had the  shogun roll and shishito peppers, all fresh and delicious! My friend had the scallop volcano roll and loved it. Her first time having shishito peppers and agreed they were delicious.  Parking was easy and away from the strip and casino crowd. Good for families or a fun date. Also great options if you aren't into raw fish."}
{"text":"Decent food.   Great atmosphere.   I had the shrimp  tempura and it was good.  Not great but good.   I like the fact that they're open super late we came today primetime I would probably only come back late night it's not gonna be my prime time spot in the morning but late night I might give it another chance"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I've had and I've tried several spots in LA. sushi is fresh (pleasantly surprised by the real crab in the Rainbow Roll), service is fast, and it's a nice relaxing spot to go before you start your night! May even be back here later since they're open til 6 am. 

Very close to the Hard Rock!

Looks like our new go-to spot for sushi when we come here."}
{"text":"After a long night  and a long drive, I wasn't too impressed with this place. We ordered 3 different rolls and they must've thought that we were ordering from the kiddie menu. Even the sauces could be measured by a squirt. I don't know if this is the norm or if they figured that we wouldn't recognize the bite sizes until we reached home. The only good thing was that it was open at 12:30 in the morning."}
{"text":"Ordered the tuna sashimi plate didn't care for it. 
Ordered the double yellowtail roll, didn't enjoy that as well.
Ordered the kiss of fire it was good but not great. 

I've been to kaizen a few times, usually it's on point and decent quality.  This time I don't feel like that was the case. Tuna sashimi was warm and fish did not look fresh. That kinda put me off on the whole meal."}
{"text":"Great sushi, good atmosphere. Unusually odd music choice (DJ techno dance music? Insert gag reflex here. Was i supposed to BYO Molly?) but it IS Las Vegas so what do you expect?"}
{"text":"The restaurant is super clean and modern.  Hip and electric Music is playing in the background. Servers are nice and I would recommend this place to anyone.  The sauce can be on the sugary side fyi. Ivan was super nice.    Request him."}
{"text":"This restaurant made my fiance and I physically ill. It is by far the worst sushi joint I have ever been to. Not only did they completely screw up my takeout order, but they served us bad fish. I called to speak with management and was told I would be called back the next day. I called back the next day after my call wasn't returned, and again, no manager. Same thing for day 3 and 4. Only after threatening to contact the health department was I coincidentally given to the manager. Who offered no apology, and instead offered a $20 credit for next time. Why on earth would I return to a restaurant that made me sick?? Anyway, I was eventually offered a $11.99 cash refund. Which is a complete joke, not to mention insult. I will be contacting the health department this morning, as this is not acceptable. This place should be shut down for criminal negligence."}
{"text":"Solid place for sushi. Good portions and large menu variety with fast service. My boyfriend and I got the spicy tuna salad which was HUGE (a bit too spicy for my tastes but still tasty). We also got the Kai and Twilight rolls and they did not disappoint. 

All in all, great place if you're nearby."}
{"text":"5 stars for being the only sushi restaurant open so late (conveniently across from the Hard Rock!)  The service was on point when I went and the food came out very quickly.  Only downside I see is that there aren't any private tables.  The Saketinis were delicious! I tried the pomegranate and lychee and would highly recommend the lychee.  The rolls were delicious, and if youre a raw food/sashimi fanatic, definitely try out the Rose Roll!  My server was very attentive and continuously checked in/out with me and my SO.  If you're drunk or hungry at 2AM and you're looking for an amazing sushi restaurant, then stop by at Kaizen!"}
{"text":"I go to this place a few times a month for dinner because of the tasty food, shockingly good services and reasonable prices. Always stuffed by the time I leave.

Made the decision to go there for lunch and was happily surprised with their lunch menu.

Although I ordered my regular Chicken Teriyaki bowl, my friends ordered the \"boxes\" which is only available at lunch. Will order the Box next time since you get a lot of different types of food for the same price.

Love this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"JUST LEFT Kaizen. Sat at Sushi bar with owner/chef Danny- Let him create me dinner. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING. Charged me $162 for absolutly mediocre sushi...stay away from this RIP OFF place. NOBU across the street, might be just as expensive, but the fish would be fresh and taste much better. A total rip off- NEVER again. If you go, don't say you weren't warned. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kaizen sits across from the Hard rock hotel nestled in the corner of the CVS plaza. Between Capriotti's and Ferraro's Italian. 

Here is the breakdown according to me. It's in my area.. it's slightly over-priced sushi.. and the service is sometimes good, sometimes they forget things.. lol.. what do you want from a place that is often pumping until 5 am. 

We head over there for a late night sushi fix, and most importantly.. the 2 for 1 .. ANYTHING from the bar.. after midnight. Usually that equals cheap sake and beer.. but it does the trick for cheap. Also I always see Carrot top there.. which is good or bad? You tell me.. it just is :] 

You can find me there on any given evening with a crew or just me and one of my foodie buddies.. mostly for me it's about the liquor and the broiled yellow tail fish collar. Yes... you read that right. if you don't know, now you know.. check it out. It's not that you can't get fish collar at other Asian style eateries, but this one is close by so I'm there most :)

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Unique sushi like giant clam and abalone sushi..I didn't  like eating either one of them. The giant clam just didnt have much flavor. The abalone was like eating cartilage.

The fatty  tuna was good and some kind of fish belly sashimi was good. Service was soooo slow in the beginning. It took forever just to get started with our beer/sake. The sashimi is a bit better than an average place, but not great. Uni was not fresh. Sweet shrimp was not that great ($28 for 4 pieces).

We ordered 3 bottles of sake and 2 bottles of beer for 11 people. We couldn't finish 1 of the bottles of sake and asked if we could return it. They were ok with it."}
{"text":"Three stars it is, because the food is always fresh and tasty. I love the location and food, but the service needs major facelift. I've been here about 5 times in the last 3 months and the last experience was the one that made up my mind to stop coming to this specific location. 

In our seating area we were the first table to arrive and then a few other people arrived about 5 minutes later. We were immediately ready to order, but instead our waiter took their order instead...  [worst] thing a waiter could do.. in my book.

He came to our table 10 minutes later the came back with sushi that was completely drenched in sauce to the point where I could't eat it and the dish they served it on was so darn small  my food was spilling all over the place, so I asked for larger dish... weird... 

The place wasn't packed and it took another 15 minutes to get a check and get out. Ugh... Despite the repeated poor service at this specific joint, I still recommend Kaizen, but at a different location."}
{"text":"Delicious sashimi as always! There good here is always amazing and they have three best Miso soup. The staff is always great and it's spotless all the time."}
{"text":"my husband and i are complete sushi lovers.  it's not too often we absolutely love a sushi place, but Kaizen Fusion is great!  the environment is trendy with top 40 music videos playing on a large plazma tv.  the rolls are fresh and perfect for one-size bites.  our favorite was the \"sexy roll\" for spicy tuna lovers. price is reasonable (just a few that are $$), and the service is also friendly.  

afterwards we walk down the street to Hard Rock for some gambling and drinks to end the night."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. I liked the vibe of the place. The sushi was fresh and our waitress very kind. I would recommend it. Will be back when I'm in Vegas next time."}
{"text":"My Cali sushi style home away from home when in Nevada.  Was introduced to Kaizen by a local back in 2012 and now hit this off-yet-close-to-Strip spot most times I'm in Vegas (5-12 times/year).

They have a relaxed, nice vibe with friendly, efficient service and a great spread of rolls and solid quality fish.  

A great spot to sink some cold beer/sake and fill your belly with friends after a massive few days on the town ;)"}
{"text":"I came to Las Vegas during the SEMA convention, and I been coming here to eat every day! The food is amazing! The atmosphere is very nice as well! I highly recommend coming here to eat!  yummyy"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  We were happy to get off the strip for a night and find a good meal at a decent price.  It was small but perfect !  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Roll was refreshing and had nice cut pieces of tuna on top.  Ordered mango lobster roll.  Would order again here"}
{"text":"Closes at 4am but if you want to be served get there before 3am or they send you away. Really a bummer this place really used to be a great spot especially for industry and late nighters."}
{"text":"8/11/14 Came right when it opened so there was no wait and the host seated is immediately! I think we came to roll heaven!! There was a binder full of different rolls, it was amazing! 

The husband ordered the Rock & Roll, it has tuna, salmon, white fish, crab, radish, asparagus, radish sprouts and yamagobo, no rice and is wrapped in cucumber...I ordered the nabeyaki udon.

We liked the interior of the place all wooden tables with a long sushi bar and very nicely insulated, keeping us cool in the heat...We definitely plan to come back!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Kaizen establishment closer to my house on Eastern Ave. I had friends in town and they were staying at the Cosmopolitan. I picked them up and took them out for lunch to Kaizen. I was surprised to order my usual items that I was used to but they were served differently. Not a bad thing, but it did catch me off guard. 
The service was ok, had a little issue with my wifes soda being frozen. They did bring a new one out. Overall, a good dining experience. Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Sushi at 3:30am!  No, it's not a typo.  This place is actually open until 4am on a Monday night.  And it's the only place any of the bartenders, waitstaff, hosts, taxi drivers, and security guards at Wynn, TI, The Venetian, or Fashion Show mall knew about....  so I'll go ahead and declare this the latest-open sushi place I've ever been to on this continent.  (If you know of anything open later in Norcal, DC, or LV, message me.)

The taxi ride here from the strip was all of like $7.  Of course we spent more than that, because we first tried Tao for sushi, but it was closed.  Then Social House - closed.  Then Ra: cerrado.  Then Hamada: shut, barely.  Then here, after burning a few hundred walking calories and a yuppie food stamp on the taxi.  Once we got here, the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  And the place was actually about a quarter full - with the younger party-looking set.  No one raving drunk though.  The nigiri was a bit more expensive than that would've-been-$7 taxi ride per pair but not exorbitant for Vegas.  Not the cheapest or best I've had, but the salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna nigiri were all fresh enough and they did have some delicious, albeit very thinly sliced toro ($19/pair), again at 3am.  I mean if someone can satisfy my sushi craving at 3am on a Monday night making the fish taste good is gravy.  They also had some white tuna that is the \"pure white\" type we geigens love and large bottles of Kirin.  And we couldn't help but notice a group of 4 at the bar doing sake bombs dominoes style (which the undergrad in me says looked pretty cool I must admit).  

I doubt 3am sake bombs are even legal in Cali.  Along with most other things in this town.  Viva Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here before heading to the airport (leaving Vegas...so sad).

Thought that they had very inventive rolls, but was disappointed in the complete lack of a lunch special (was there at 1 pm) as well as the service. The waitress was pleasant and helpful, but was the only one working the entire lunch rush and couldn't handle everything. I sat at the bar and waited a good deal of time between each roll, and had empty water glasses the entire time.

I think the service is probably perfectly fine when there are more employees there, and the rolls were certainly tasty. Slightly overpriced in my opinion, but tasty. I'd say this place is worth a try if you're headed to the airport and want somewhere that isn't flooded with tourists."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, great ambiance (Olympics playing on multiple TVs....go Team USA!)"}
{"text":"Amazing service. My water glass was always full and I drank about 4 glasses of water. The staff was very polite and courteous. It was slow nut multiple staff members made an effort to ensure my wife and I were taken care of. The food was great we the new Zealand mussels in dynamite sauce it was one of the best appetizers I've ever had at a Japanese restaurant. For the sushi we got the T.T Girls and Crazy Girl rolls they were great. All Kaizen was a great place to grab an early sushi dinner. Thanks Kaizen Staff"}
{"text":"It was the afternoon after a crazy night and I was hungry and a bit hungover. I didn't want a fancy place. I didn't want a touristy place. We were staying at the Hard Rock so we dedided to check out the strip mall across the street. Kaizen Sushi was closed at that time, and even though I couldn't see what the inside looked like, the sushi craving kicked in.

We came back later on and I am so glad we did. I ordered a couple of rolls, one being The Hungry Roll.. oh my god! it was enormous.. I would have been good with just that!!

We went back another time with a pretty large group of friends and they were very accomodating. I tried some of the baked rolls, which were delicious and not so heavy as my beloved tempura rolls. Eveyone else's food looked good, and no one had any complaints. I had the Lychee martini which was very tasty. We also got the party started with shots with ty ku.. sooo yummy! I wish they had it in L.A.

Overall, I love how it is nice yet very casual. Also, they have such a big selection of rolls!!!!

My only complaint (which wasn't the restaurants fault) is that we had them call a cab for us and we waited for about an hour and they never showed up. We walked over to the Hard Rock and the taxi line was huge. It was hot and it was annoying..... not the restaurants fault, but something to keep in mind!"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI PLACE IN THE CITY. I've been here multiple times and the rolls meet all expectations. Freshness, Flavor, Presentation, Large Rolls, High End quality. Nice little setup too! The service is a little bit average but who cares! Drink and have some rolls :)"}
{"text":"It is fresh, gorgeous, delicious food! Exceptionally friendly staff. Prices are a bonus. You get high quality food without paying Las Vegas Strip premium prices. On paradise across from the Hard Rock. 

Order the Avocado Train! Yummmmmmm!"}
{"text":"The Sushi is amazing. The service and atmosphere is top notch. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas from Canada and I really enjoyed the sushi that they had and their wonderful staff and service. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the best I have had, fresh and the staff is great! If you like sushi you need to try this palce."}
{"text":"The fianc√© and I were staying at a near by hotel so we decided to give this place a try.  We were really surprised at how fast our rolls were served. Aside from the fast service this was probably the worse sushi I ever had in Vegas. The rice in the rolls was a bit on the hard sticky side, and every time we picked a roll it immediately felled apart. The rolls were on the smaller side and did not justified the value of the higher prices. The fish didn't tasted very fresh, in fact there was a fishy after taste to it. 

I came to the conclusion that the sushi we had was pre-made and had been sitting in a fridge for a while. My suspicion came from the very fast serving after ordering it, literally 3-4 minutes had gone by and we got our first and second roll. Our third roll came in at around the 7 minute mark. The third sushi roll was hot and it tasted like it had been microwaved, probably why the wait time was longer. My fianc√© and I had the Philadelphia roll, crunchy roll...nothing crunchy about this, and lasagna roll. I was greatly dissatisfied with the sushi and have no plans of ever coming back here again."}
{"text":"Came here late starving. Sat down and ordered. Food came unbelievably fast with great quality. Definitely exceeded my expectation! Recommended!"}
{"text":"We came here when another restaurant had an hour and half wait. We were unable to sit at a table either since all empty tables were reserved and tables were taken. This is a busy night on a Sunday. I was starving and just wanted to eat. We sat at the sushi bar.

The servers were nice and courteous. They were patient while we reviewed the menu. I had my mind set on KBBQ so I was trying to figure out what I wanted. I went with sharing the spicy tuna roll and ordered the nabeyaki udon. This was surprisingly delicious! The server cracked the egg in the udon and I asked for their spicy sauce. Their sauce was so good! The spicy sauce definitely packs a kick and they warned us to start out with a little since it's hot. I loved it! Delicious. The udon noodles were perfect and the broth was good. I don't usually eat udon at restaurants since I like to eat this at home so this was a great surprise. Thank you for making my night!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and music is great the servers are pretty knowledgeable about the menus and sushi in general, the sushi taste fresh and is a good size. Another little side note the sell some of the art pieces that are up for display at the restaurant. The happy hour is a pretty decent length only down side is there's no all you can eat but as long as you know what you want there should be no problem, my favorite roll is the Philadelphia roll :D"}
{"text":"The best sushi spot In Vegas. I always come here when visiting. Try the salmon killer it's the best. I can't believe how the fish is so fresh."}
{"text":"It was ok :/ and kinda felt rushed when ordering. Over priced to and no all you can eat"}
{"text":"3.5

we were craving raw oysters.. again. gosh, what is it about Vegas that makes me crave oysters all the time!?

we stopped in for a light meal. we got a plate of sashimi ($20), a roll, and of course, oysters (5pc for $12). 

the roll was just okay.. not to mention the spicy mayo was sweet (ew?) .. however! that plate of sashimi must have been one of the freshest and tastiest sashimi i've had. this was also my second time having yellowtail sashimi in vegas and i must say, Vegas gets shipped some darn good yellowtail. seeee ya tuna

our oysters were pretty good too but i like mine naked, how most oyster bars do them. Kaizen puts a little green onion, the orange eggs, and a ponzu sauce. still yummy and satisfying!

i'd definitely come back here again but only if im in the area for undftd/stussy or staying at the hard rock hotel.  also, come at night.. i think theyre popular for their sake specials during that time!"}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi. I had the Mexican roll and ate every bit of it. Fast service and a must to visit!"}
{"text":"Food is always good service is excellent love the quaint and family atmosphere the Miso soup is excellent the curry the chicken bone and especially the sushi is always good my favorite is the Monster Sushi"}
{"text":"This place is awful. One roll cost almost $17 and was the same quality sushi you would get at Von's. You can get better sushi at a convenience store. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Real good, but not exceptional. Priced slightly higher than average. Easy to spend $100 and not be satisfied (i.e full). Lot of rolls have spicy tuna so make sure you like spicy tuna! Cool modern design with decent service. 

Like to go at least yearly and would return."}
{"text":"fun and festive sushi spot off the strip. for those staying at the hard rock, this is a must. be careful crossing the street! it is a nice alternative 

sushi rolls are fresh and are made with some flair as well. the portions are fairly large (8 pieces) and make up for the slightly expensive menu.

watching the chefs prepare the sushi is fun too. the staff is very welcoming.

great for groups, or a casual hungover Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I only gave this a star because the food was good. 
Let's talk about the service...good lord they were so gosh darn RUDE I am baffled. I came in with a couple of friends and it's 12am on a Friday night, I would get if it was super packed, but it wasn't. So we had to share a menu, 3 waiters were \"waiting our table\" the reason for the quotations because they were doing anything but tending to us. Not like we asked for much. Just some more water since we had to wait so long to order, get our food just everything in general. Then we look over and see one of our \"waiters\" taking sake shots with his friends instead of taking care of other customers. Also don't asked for anything else after they bring you your food unless you wanna get hit with a nasty attitude like it's an inconvenience. Terrible service, whoever did the hiring needs to be let go cause they aren't a good judge of character."}
{"text":"A funning thing about the name of this restaurant \"Kaizen\", according to my Japanese colleague, means continuous improvement of something and is the motto for Toyota motors.  

They said nobody in Japan would name the restaurant \"kaizen\". I guess it's because it implies that the dishes are not at their best if you are constantly trying to improve. 

Anyhow, this place is somewhat of a novelty for the Japanese because they usually do not see nor tasted American-style sushi rolls. We ordered the tuna poke, 16pcs sushi combo, 20pcs sashimi, calamari tempura roll and a spicy rainbow roll.

Nothing is really out of the ordinary. The poke tasted a bit odd but the sashimi and spicy rainbow roll were decent. A bit on the pricey side.

There's an overhead projection of random music and videos playing. A large bar on the side. The location was easy to find with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! From the ambiance to the food; I have no complaints. I have been going here for about 3 years now & have had my birthday here twice. I work as a hostess at a restaurant on the strip and get off pretty late at night, so it is very convenient that it is open til 3 or 4 am. The staff are all friendly and accommodating; I usually dine at the sushi bar and always have a great time with the sushi chefs. The decor is modern and fun, which is a nice change from your typical sushi restaurant. The pricing of the items are reasonable and not too expensive which is nice. Everyone should definitely try the baked New Zealand mussels; I get them every time."}
{"text":"I've eaten quite a lot of sushi all around the country, but this was NOT good sushi.  It wasn't awful.  But it was about as good as the sushi you might get pre-made from a grocery store.  \"Mediocre\" is the best I could possibly rate it.   

The decor in the restaurant was beautiful; a lot nicer than I would have expected for a strip mall restaurant.  And the service was fine.  But the menus were that cheap laminated stuff you find in low-end Chinese restaurants, with poorly lit photos of the rolls.  And the descriptions were all so formulaic:  Inside - tuna avocado, on top - shrimp, sauce - ponzu.   They all read like that so that none of them stood out to you.  They all sounded pretty much the same.

But most importantly, of the 4 rolls we ordered, none were outstanding.  They were all just blah with a slightly fishy taste to the sushi.

I would NOT go here again and I would certainly not recommend it to anyone. We should have spent the extra $$ and gone across the street to Nobu (in the Hard Rock) for some seriously amazing sushi."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent! We were seated and served promptly. The kiss of fire roll is a great choice. Will definitely go back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Awesome quality on all sushi. All fresh. The food was amazing.....but a bit over priced and bad service. I will come back just because of the hours, open late and great food."}
{"text":"Amazing! Such a wide and delicious variety. Love it Have to come here every time I'm in Vegas. Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Happy to return.  This time sashimi. How do they get such fresh fish in the desert and I live by the beach local restaurants do not compare?"}
{"text":"Great off strip restaurant... Decent prices with good saki selection... Sushi was good"}
{"text":"The sushi here was great! Fun service and catering to any need. If you want a great time have V as your sushi chef and you're guaranteed a good meal!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places, for sure! Hands down, best Japanese lasagna roll I've ever eaten. I had it for the first time there and honestly, no where else compares. I took my friend there for the first time recently and she loved it. Not having had sushi much, I told her to look at the menu, read all the descriptions and pick something with the type(s) of fish she likes. She did and ordered the Alaska roll which she said was really good. They have a great menu and I love how it's decorated. My only complaint is that sometimes the service is a tad slow, but they really do try their best, and that is ok with me. A lady next to me this last time was completely rude to the server but he didn't get upset and was able to pretty much turn it around, which was awesome. I don't mind paying their prices for what I get.. I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is best place in town if you want to eat like a local across the street from hard rock olive everything about this place and prices don't bite"}
{"text":"Food is alright, nothing special tho. The restaurant itself is beautiful and servers are very polite.
They're always checking on you.
They have a nice menu, nice sake selection. They're not expensive or crowded. It could be a very good restaurant.

Here's why I'm giving this place one star, hygiene. 
As soon as we sat down I noticed a piece of hair on the small soy sauce dish, not cool! But I decided to ignore it since my husband gave me his, as I was the only one who was going to eat.
A few minutes after we started eating I asked for paper napkins and as the server was bringing them to me one fell down on the floor. Surprisingly she picked it up and put it together with the other napkin she was bringing me... After giving me the clean and dirty napkin she took the dirty one with her saying it was dirty, and I honestly believe that if she knew we hadn't seen it she would have given me the dirty and the clean one. 
That was the end for me, I could barely finish my meal as I was disgusted.

It's a nice restaurant with good food but they could use hygiene."}
{"text":"I wish I could say that I was drunk and stumbled upon this sushi joint... but instead, I came here to grab a take-out lunch while I was staying at the Hyatt Hotel supervising a group of tourists to a trip to Vegas.  It would have made it much more entertaining if I did.

In any case, Kaizen Sushi is not a bad place to get your sushi fixing in Vegas.  They specialize in fusion rolls, so right off the bat, you know that you should focus more so on them instead of simply nigiri or sashimi.  The atmosphere inside reminded me of a very fancy bar, both very dark and roomy.  They have a pretty sweet deal for those night owls (or those trying to be) where much of their food becomes half off.  Considering that this place is open late, this place is definitely for those post-clubbing events.

For my mini lunch, I ordered the Calamari Tempura Roll, which came out to be about $8.  I love eating fried squid, and was interested in seeing their take on combining it into a sick sushi roll.  What I really loved about this roll was that even though it came in only five pieces, they gave me the extra calamari on the side.  It also came with a sweet dipping sauce.

My roll was okay.  Nothing to rave about to be honest, but it was a good way for me to get my sushi fixing for the day.  Everything else on the menu seems to be way overpriced, especially in Vegas when there are so many other eating bargains out there.

Definitely worth a try, but go ahead and gamble at Hard Rock and make some moolah first before you come here.  Then you can fest like a KING/QUEEN!

Parking is available outside in the plaza."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Las Vegas and need a sushi fix. I only go to Kaizen Sushi. I have been to every sushi restaurant in Las Vegas and Kaizen tasted the best. The store is always clean and the food is super fresh. I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place! Spent 5 years in Japan - this is as close as it gets!! Fast service amazing fresh food!"}
{"text":"In essence...

No AYCE. Overpriced because it is so close to the Strip. $60+ with tip for 2 people.

My husband and I managed to land here for sushi on a Friday night. We did this because the line for Yama Sushi (which is my fave sushi spot in town) had a line waaaay out the door and to be honest I just did not want to wait that long. So. Enter Kaizen, which had good Yelp reviews, but alas, was somewhat of a disappointment. 

First with the good, the place LOOKS fabulous. Dark exterior, plays with lovely lighting and the tables are large with good spacing. Dinnerware and presentation is superb, but it better be since this place is so close to the Strip. Customer service is so-so. Although the entire staff yells as people enters/leaves, our service with food to our table was only okay. I ordered a hot green tea and it was brought out in a large cup, which I dislike because I enjoy my tea HOT. As it sits uncovered it cools down quickly and not once did a server ask to refill it. I prefer smaller cups and pots of tea for this reason.

Ordered:

- Edamame 
- California Roll
- Tuna Roll 
- Shrimp Roll
- Spicy Rainbow Roll
- Spicy Tuna Hand Roll

Pluses - size of rolls at least (kind of) make you not feel so bad about how much you are paying and that you cannot get AYCE here. PLUS, again, presentation is great and sushi is very good quality. The only qualm I had was with the Tuna Roll being a bit on the warmer side when it arrived at our table than I would have liked.

My husband is a super picky sushi eater (hence the very plain rolls we had). The place does have some interesting rolls, the spicy rainbow roll was decent, and large, I'm glad I ordered it as it did fill me up.

BEST - Edamame, just stinking amazing for some reason. Served steaming, with a good amount of salt, and a LARGE portion.

Not the best... again, price wise you can find just as good sushi elsewhere and Vegas, except you don't have to pay for the atmosphere and Jay-Z music videos in the background.... HOLY GRAIL!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in and for a second, i thought I was in a Italian restaurant. Everything was so fancy and the host looked Italian. Then i saw the nicely formed, eye appealing varieties of sushi on the white plates.  As i looked through the menu, it was so hard to choose which roll to get. I wanted to try them all but my bank account wouldn't let me. The waiter was patient and made some recommendations. As soon as it came to the table we devoured them up, thus no picture was taken.  The rice on each roll was fluffy and not overly sticky, the fish was cold, firm and tasty, the rolls that had tempura waa freshly made, evident from the crunch and warmth of the tempura as you bit into the whole roll. My favorite had to be the roll with fresh tuna and roe. The roe just pops as you bite into it. In all we ordered 5 different rolls and spent over 80 with tip. I don't usually spend this amount for so little food and if I do it has to be spectacular. This place hit it out of the ballfield."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekday around 8 and the place was nearly empty. Had very prompt service and food came quick. Food was very flavorful and food. Drink choice for other than saki was lacking but overall very good experience"}
{"text":"My wife raved about this place so when I just recently visited, we stopped by.  Not sure why there are any complaints about the service as I thought it was fantastic.  I'm guessing they have been working on their service and improving upon it.  We walked in and  were immediately greeted by a cheerful hostess/waitress (one that actually smiles).  Rolls were awesome, their eel sauce was amazing.  They had an appetizer I had never tried before, they were peppers that were sauteed- very delish!!  
I'd definitely come back foh sho!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing, the staff was super friendly, very clean and inviting. The feel of the place from when I walked in was exactly what I expected, perfect."}
{"text":"Ambiance was ok....food was delicious.  My husband had the Teriyaki Beef bowl and it was bomb! I had the Sexy Magura roll and it was pretty good but nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is always fresh and the service it great. They are open late, so we end up here all the time."}
{"text":"We are visiting Las Vegas for the second time and we are looking for a cheaper sushi place! I love sushi and had it in multiple places before, but this one is great !!!!Awesome food and pretty atmosphere! Not busy and great service! The prices are good also, average i would say, but perfect for the quality!!"}
{"text":"Good place for sushi i go here for lunch with friends they have good lunch specials and i also can go here at night there open late and its a nice place. Also the fish is always fresh which keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a trendy and current restaurant.  I liked the artwork, the decorations, and the environment is inviting. Great food options and the service was quick, pleasant, and everyone was hospitable.   Great place to meet with friends, or have a quick lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Freaking love this place! Come here every time we are in Vegas. Went in with a party of 18.. Awesome service and extremely timely. See you guys in a few months!"}
{"text":"Good food, service, and atmosphere. The only thing I didn't like was how loud the music was. The sushi and service more than made up for it though."}
{"text":"Always come here. The guys that make the sushi are the best at it. Always have great customer service here. My favorite dish is the salmon skin cut rolls and spicy garlic edamame. My go to drink is the lychee martini! P.s. they're open till like 5am...dont ask me how I know lol"}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com!!! Get the avocado train has got to be the staple! Servers are great sushi awesome bring family friends."}
{"text":"No doubt the best in Vegas. Top notch quality in terms of food, taste, presentation, service, environment, EVERYTHING! As a recent transplant to Vegas, this is absolutely my go-to place for sushi, a la carte or AYCE!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!!

This place is located across from the Hard Rock in the CVS Plaza. It is a cool place with a nice atmosphere as far as sushi places go.

It is not an AYCE place and it will cost you quite a bit of cash if you eat like you are at an AYCE place, but the sushi is excellent and the staff is very friendly. I use to get sushi to-go from here all the time when I worked in the area.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and great service! Super polite staff and they were really quick to make the sushi!"}
{"text":"First time coming here.
Service was friendly.
The rolls were so good!
A little on the pricey side but well worth it!

We ordered the avocado train which was my favorite.
It is avocado lobster soft shell crab and crab. 
I had my usual spicy tuna roll. 
And we had a rainbow roll.
We then asked for another roll that they recommend.
He made us the orange blossom I believe it was called. 
It was great too!"}
{"text":"The Japanese word \"Kaizen\" brings back memories of my B-school days, when studying operations management in the car industry.  Kaizen means \"continuous improvement\" - why would any restaurant want to name themselves this?  Maybe Kaizen Sushi is aware of its shortcomings and wants to strive to be the best.  HMMM...

Food & Drinks
I came here with a couple of girlfriends for lunch and we immediately ordered lychee sake.  Points for having this on the menu!  It might be the Boone's Farm of sake, but can't deny that it was goooood!  We didn't want anything too heavy to eat because we had early dinner reservations, so one of my girlfriends had sashimi, the other had a bento box of short ribs, while I had the ahi salad.  As you can see, the unifying thread was NO RICE  (we were going clubbing that night - we didn't want to look TOO bloated!)  Amazingly, these dishes were satisfying - the portions were pretty generous.  Because we ordered from the lunch menu, everything was reasonably priced.   No complaints here!

Atmosphere
Kaizen is located in a little strip mall, so we weren't expecting the place to look anything less than your run-of-the mill sushi joint.  However, Kaizen had some pizzazz - the walls were colorful and rock music was playing.  We felt like we had walked into a bar.  For what it is, Kaizen scores points for atmosphere too - no complaints here either!

Service
This is where Kaizen should practice some Kaizen.  Orders came to the table slowly and randomly.  The bento box came first, which had my friend & I drooling.  My order came last, and by this time I was ravenous!  They should have served our food all at once! 

So I'd give Kaizen 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll round up because their name suggests they are striving for perfection.  As far as the service goes, I should hope so!"}
{"text":"All the rolls were fab! Best sushi I have had in years. If you are the area you gotta go!"}
{"text":"TUNA POKE WAS AMAZING. Sushi was fresh and sashimi pieces were nice and thick. Everything was on point  even for being open til 4am"}
{"text":"I have sushi several times this week in Vegas and this is far and away the best that I have had. Tastes amazing (ask for the fresh wasabi!) doesn't break the bank and is super fast. I was incredibly impressed. I will happily drive from LA to eat here.  So good!"}
{"text":"Wasn't so impressed by this spot. The location is conveniently close to the strip, but the sushi wasn't anything great. Given that many of the Vegas sushi spots are AYCE, I expected the non-AYCE sushi restaurants to have higher quality fish. 
They have an extensive menu of Japanese fusion dishes. Seems like the popular thing to get here are their specialty rolls. My rolls were poorly put together, but I was okay with it, given that it was late at night and I was craving sushi."}
{"text":"You would think that when guests request two AYCE menus at the BEGINNING of the meal, the server would correct them. Clearly not the case in this half-assed sister location to Kaizen on Flamingo and Arville (who DOES do AYCE); paid for four to eat for two.
Outrageous pricing for mediocre food and minimal customer service. Get it together."}
{"text":"Went with some local friends while visiting Vegas. Did not look like much from the outside, but the interior is well done. Simple with an open feel. There is open seating in the middle of the room to utilize its space and to keep it from feeling crowded. Both the food and service were good. As noted by others it is open til 4 AM on most days which is a plus in Vegas. I was told by my friend that they have a DJ's performing during the late night. 

Will likely return when in Vegas next."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  We had grilled octopus, paradise roll and red dragon.  If truth be told 4 of us got 3 paradise rolls because it was so amazing!  I definitely recommend this place when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Vegas... I have to say the customer service is amazing.. staff is always welcoming and polite.. we frequent here so almost everyone knows us and our orders. That's the best feeling ever..."}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious sushis. We had intended to go to a Korean BBQ restaurant in the same plaza but the wait was over one hour, so we walked a few steps to find this place. The restaurant had a nice ambiance with the white Christmas lights and the fringe curtains that separates the restaurant to different sections to create a cozy atmosphere. Servers are super attentive and you don't even have to flag them down to get a refill. We did family style and we shared our sushi rolls. They are very large and beautiful presented. The avocado train was picture perfect and tasted delicious with a big ball of crab wrapped with avocado! It was so beautiful! Their Ninja roll was a perfect combination of just a little spicy kick without being too spicy. Rainbow roll was just average. I would recommend that you order their specialty sushis and not your typical sushi rolls. You will be blown away!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere and delicious sushi rolls. We had the TT Girls and the Orange Blossom.  Heavenly! Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great and the chefs know how to make any roll you can think of classic or otherwise. Service is good hot food is good, and best of all it's NOT gougey Vegas pricing. If your stuck at the hard rock for some convention or something walk across the street and have a nice Japanese meal with some cold unfiltered sake and forget about all the money you lost at the tables."}
{"text":"I eat here often
For the past 9 years actually
The sushi lasagna is incredible and a must!
Soy paper!!!"}
{"text":"I love sushi! 
I can literally live on sushi!
Kaizen Sushi so conveniently located, I come here every week.
It's a small restaurant. Everyone knows everyone!
It's like family! 
The waiters and waitresses are always happy.
They are always welcome us with a smiley face.
Our servers always know what we drink, but for curtesy, they always checking on our orders, asking if we like something else. Mostly we drink iced tea.
They serve passion fruit tea, always very fresh.
We tried the Sake (Lychee flavor) first time. It's great flavor, kind of sweet, but good, if you like sweet drinks.

My favorite items are: Sexy Rolls; Nevada Rolls; Crunchy Scallops Rolls.
I don't always eat raw fish, so I am happy to order the above mentioned. Those rolls are a very fine balance with great flavor.

Besides the rolls, I really like the Seafood Curry Udon. Personally, I don't eat very spicy food. So, I asked them to make sure the curry is very low, and a sauce is very light on my udon. They prepare it perfectly for me.
BF likes the Chicken or Beef Curry Udon.
Both of the meals are in great balance of either the seafood or meat and vegetables over the Udon (noodles) and the curry sauce.

For dessert, I really liked their deep fried green tea ice cream. It's a huge portion, so it can be easily shared. 

Love their recently remodeled dining room!
The white chairs are making the restaurant look much nicer than before.
The atmosphere is great. Music sometimes louder than I like, but high energy, so it doesn't bother me!

I noticed some art/paintings are displayed on the walls, and they are for sale. So if you like them, you can purchase it!"}
{"text":"This is the best bang for your buck on Vegas if you want sushi. Amazing."}
{"text":"Wow what an AMAZING sushi spot!! Came here on our way into town and were fully satisfied with the sashimi Eddie the sushi chef prepped. The ahi, salmon and yellow tail tasted like they fresh out of the Hawaiian Waters's. Bonus the lunch was only $12.95 for 9 pieces!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for his birthday dinner since we were in town. The menu is impressive. So much to choose from! Taking a shot of the menu won't do justice. We ordered the Orange Blossom, Spicy Tataki roll, & Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice. All were so tasty! The Orange tasty was the one we favored most and it was recommended."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for lunch!  They have these lunch specials and all are big portions for a good price.  The sashimi combo was very fresh and the tempura was good too!
I have been there several times and my boss goes there almost every day.  The only waitress i have seen can work the whole lunch by herself and does a great job.
I am sure we will be back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  We eat here every time we are in Vegas.  Reasonable priced, great selection, excellent rolls, and super friendly staff.  Have never been disappointed.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my happy place. Whenever I'm in Las Vegas, this is the very first place and very last place I go to as I'm coming and going - luggage and all. The atmosphere is great, the food is superb, the people are amazing. I can't think of a negative thing to say about Kaizen. Well, maybe that it's not in California???

It's not a touristy spot so it's not crowded. I've seriously been here at all times of the day and I've never had to wait to be seated. There is plenty of parking. I'm telling you, this place is so unassuming that I'm tempted to keep it my little secret. This place is so awesome though, that it deserves all the success and accolades."}
{"text":"The sushi at this place is some of the best I've ever had. The Shogun Roll is amazing. We ordered the bento box for our kids. They loved it. And had to order extra egg rolls because they are sooo good. We will come back for sure. The rolls are on the pricier end, $12-$15 per roll. Worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"A little pricier than my guy and I like, but we splurge here every once in a while. Or we'll get our taste in sushi and then fill up on capriottis next door. Definitely recommend the banana tempura roll. Its the reason we go here. Its way super weird but way super delicious, trust me. Always had good service here. They're polite about the fact that we order 6 miso soups."}
{"text":"Our fav go to sushi spot! Extremely fast service and the food is DEEEEEELICIOUS! Guaranteed to leave with a smile and full belly :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to Sushi place when I'm in Vegas. One of the most fancy but affordable spot to get your craving for sushi satisfied."}
{"text":"I love going here after work with my girls. Their sushi rolls are really delicious. My fave roll is the Avocado Train. Service is usually really good, but EXCELLENT when we get our fave server Jun. Yummmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Very good food. Nice ambiance. We for Nevada roll, Dragon roll and Rainbow roll plus Kaizen ceviche. Super fresh fish all around."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant when we were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel (another story) and needed a place to have dinner. It was within walking distance & after checking it out on Yelp and seeing some good reviews, we gave it a try. Very good sushi & the manager and wait staff were very nice & attentive. We both had sushi & edamame and I also had miso soup.  We were both full when we left & the bill was about $40, including my ice tea and my husband's beer. We would eat here again if we were in the area, but since we would never stay at Hard Rock Hotel again, that most likely won't happen. If you like sushi and are stuck at HRH, this place should be on your list."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town all fresh and amazing prices 
And also open 24 hours  . Everything on the menu tastes good, great services everyone is very friendly . We come here often especially late night because it's open late. Their happy hour specials are great !"}
{"text":"Very nice sushi experience with reasonable prices for Vegas. Cute atmosphere for a casual date. Off the beaten trail but well worth it."}
{"text":"Fish was very very good. Tasted fresh, nice presentation, and good prices. Absolutely would come again."}
{"text":"If you come and eat there on an empty stomach, you'll definitely get your money's worth! If I lived in Vegas, this would be my go to spot!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Kaizen (across from Hard Rock) 3 times and the one in Henderson once, and each time has been consistently wonderful!  My 3 favorite items are the spicy tuna rice crisp (2nd only to Katsu-ya in Studio City, LA, where I think this sushi originated), Korean BBQ Roll and Seared Wahoo Sushi (very rare to see this Hawaiian fish sushi anywhere).  The various  soju/sake martinis are great, the atmosphere is hip and relaxing, and this place opens until 4:00 am, 'nuff said!"}
{"text":"The sushi looks pretty, but it was tasteless to me.
Was missing something on the flavor area, soon can't give a great review when taste wasn't there."}
{"text":"We came out for dinner after a long day at work. There are so many choices in the area, and we finally agreed to stop here. We made a GREAT choice. I do not eat sushi, but ordered the chicken yakisoba. It was worth the extra to have white meat. 

Very good meal."}
{"text":"I am not a sushi eater but I had some of the a la carte items like the chicken veggie teppan and it was so good ! 

Definitely great prices, and from what I can tell the all you can eat sushi is a great deal. 

I recommend the cucumber salad and chicken & veggie teppan."}
{"text":"We ate here when in Vegas for Defcon last year and I LOVED this place! The food was really fresh and the wait staff was really nice and catered to our vegetarian needs.   This experience before I began eating fish again so that was really important to me.  I loved the cucumber Salad (Sunomono) and the way it was served in a martini glass, vegetable rolls, cucumber rolls, avocado rolls, we delicious and plated beautifully as well.  I would definitely come here again especially to hit up the happy hour specials & free sake bombs when you spend $15 :) Yuuuuuummmmy!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing :) would definitely come back again when I visit Vegas. Good ppl and fast :)"}
{"text":"Within walking distance of my hotel, this place was a great find!

What I had:

Jalapeno popper roll: This was good but the cream cheese they used had no flavor. The outside was fried lightly and had a great crunch to it, even ordering it for take-out.

Las Vegas Roll: I loved this one. Would highly recommend it! 

Ordering take-out was super easy. The staff is friendly, and it came out pretty quickly. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing and flavorful sushi, great happy hour (1+1 on alcohol, till they close). Very nice atmosphere, great service, it was the best food experience throughout this trip. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Service was ok, but not the best. Ordered dinner for two from the sushi menu. We were looking for some soft shell crab. They delivered a breaded and deep fried something - was hard to even tell it had crab in it. One of the unagi pieces I ordered tasted a little funky, but one was ok. I read many reviews before opting to come here. I can't imagine even going to an AYCE sushi restaurant. To those who complain about price, we paid $60 for a light dinner here, but would have much rather paid the $200 elsewhere and gotten ten times better food and service. Couldn't go there though, because it was Wednesday. :("}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Great for a little stop for a craving or an entire meal."}
{"text":"I love this place. My favorite is the spicy tuna salad. It's like a spicy tuna roll in salad form, minus the rise. I also recommend the grilled peppers and their fancy rolls."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!!


Took my girlfriends here for a birthday celebration and they can't stop thanking me!!! The presentation of these dishes are perfection!!!"}
{"text":"Been here since it first opened..  Still good to this day.  Love the music video playing..  Also enjoyed the strawberry nigori"}
{"text":"Love Kaizen. Come here quite often after hours. Good rolls and prompt service. The staff could be more friendly but I'll deal with it for good food at 4am. They should have a children's menu too, kids are not going to eat a whole bowl to themselves."}
{"text":"We have eaten multiple times at Kaizen and they never disappoint, fish is fresh and the staff is friendly and prompt! Being from LA we are blessed with great sushi and don't eat sushi in the casinos so it was great to find Kaizen a few years back on one of our trips to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  We were looking for a sushi restaurant that wouldn't be overpriced and easy to get into.  Kaizen fit the bill and was great. More selections that you can fathom."}
{"text":"Fresh fish good service nice buzzy ambience at a fraction of the strip prices. 
Amazingly broad selection of sushi rolls.
Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place that I intend to go here for my Birthday to have a drink and enjoy the wonderful rolls here. My waitress here last time was ultra attentive and nice. The prices are fair and food is just amazing like I mean really good. It had me dazing in class one time because I wanted to go here to fix my sushi craving."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I've had, reasonable prices for good sushi. Good sized rolls. We had five rolls, only one we really didn't car for. The raw scallop roll. Defiantly thumbs up!"}
{"text":"In a city of overpriced oversized greasy meals I am always happy to find some sushi.
Great ahi poke, farmed salmon :( 
Decent variety of rolls. Kinda pricey but I should expect as much since its Vegas and I'm from Vancouver!"}
{"text":"I must admit I was a little skeptical visiting a sushi restaurant a little off the beaten path on the strip. 

Boy was I wrong!

Excellent service and outstandingly prepared well tasting fresh sushi. Guess where I'm going again on my next visit to the City of Sin

Btw: avocado train is a must have!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"By far the worst sushi restaurant I've ever been too...

My friends and I love sushi so it wasn't a surprise that we came here considering it was right next to our hotel. We got seated really fast and we were kinda excited about the menu since there was a lot of variety. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 rolls since we usually get that amount of rolls at other sushi restaurants thinking it will fill us up. Once my friends and I got our sushi, we were pissed off because the sushi had like 4-6 rolls. We just looked at each other like are you freakin' serious? I had to order another sushi roll because it obviously did not fill me up. When we got our check, it was about $105 since it included gratuity already. My friends and I ended up putting $120 instead of $105 since none of us had change. So we're waiting..and...waiting for our change. The workers during that time were giving us dirty looks cause we were still there and probably wanted to clean our table. So it finally hit us, where the fuck is our change? We asked the lady if we can get our change back and she gave us a dirty look. That bitch thought that extra $15 of our \"change\" was her damn tip. Like really? The tip that was on the receipt was already $15. So this restaurant tried to get a $30 tip from my friends and I when there was only 6 of us. Really? $5 tip from each person when the food didn't even fill us up? Shake my head at those workers man."}
{"text":"Awesome food , excellent service & I like the ambience , it was our first time here & we really liked it ."}
{"text":"Great spot. I been here many times and definitely recommend it.  Food is fresh and service is always excellent. 
They have a late night happy hour."}
{"text":"Seriously underwhelmed. I came here after seeing numerous good reviews for this place. Wow, all I can say is wow this place was terrible. For starters I think it's in bad taste when they add mandatory gratuity for service. I feel a tip should be based on the service provided, which was decent but not out of this world. The iced green tea tasted like fish water. Waitress tried to tell me they add some special leaves or whatever but fish is fish is fish and that tea tasted like fish!!! The short ribs were greasy and burnt. The other rolls were decent but nothing I would come back for. Matter of fact we were left so unsatisfied we're on our way to get tacos now after leaving this place!"}
{"text":"this was like a Japanese haven in Vegas. It was late .. actually close to midnight... you'd think no one would want to feed us anymore. But Kaizen was still ready to feed us dinner! 
I had the steak(Japanese style ) of course and my hubby got the humongous rolls.. can't remember the names. but I took photos nonetheless. I was pretty hungry, so names don't linger in my head anymore at this point. got myself a miso soup to start. it was good.our server was awesome. he was extremely attentive. he suggested great appetizers, great dishes.. and he  constantly checked on us. the presentation and the dishes were exceptional. everything tasted great and fresh. for the price, it is also affordable. For Japanese, this is a place to visit. you should not miss this once in Vegas. The ambiance just needs a little updating.  it should match what they are serving I think. lol."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and fresh here. The servers and host are friendly and young. Very cool urban pace and great food. If you are on a low carb diet try the rock and roll roll it's wrapped in cucumber and pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Delicious food, great service, and a wonderful atmosphere. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"if your a fan of sushi, but cant stand all the hoopla that comes with the vegas casinos, all you can eat buffet, and ridiculous prices. Then this place is for you.  The first and most important thing is the sushi was delicious! We had sashimi, different rolls, seaweed salad, the works.  the atmosphere is is very easy going, their's no rush to get you out, the servers are very friendly and helpful, and best of all its open until 4am on most weekend nights.
Being from out of town and not being a fan of the vegas lime light. (I only go to vegas for work.)  this place is off the strip, across the street from the hard rock cafe/casino/hotel, in a corner shopping strip.  We asked our waitress (sarah) from Japonais inside the Mirage about a local place off the strip where locals go. She recommended this place.  HEY! Sarah great call thank you. 
i understand there's more than one location, lucky vegas residents.  i will be back to vegas (unfortunately), but now i have a place for sushi were the real people can go."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! We had the T.T girls roll and the Nevada roll and they were delicious! Try this place if you are here!"}
{"text":"I was craving sushi and staying down the street from this place, and was just plain not impressed.
To begin with they didnt have a great selection, so I ordered a baked salmon roll, that was TINY and so full of cream cheese that it completely over powered the taste of the salmon.
On top of that they are one of those places that charges you a fairly normal price for a soda, I want to say it was like $2.50 or something... But it's in a can, so no refills. 
Service was slow, they forgot my miso soup. 

Could have been better."}
{"text":"Nice lil' place.. great service!  I got the shrimp tempura roll, which came out with a side of tempura sweet potato.. I wasn't sure how I felt about that, as it wasn't on the menu like that.. but it was really tasty, so it ended up being a nice surprise!  The roll was okay, but not tight, so falling apart was an issue.  For my 2nd roll, I got the Crazy Girl and it was awesome!  Huge roll with great flavor!  I wasn't blown away, so I'mma check out some other sushi places before selecting my \"go to\" spot."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Tempura udon is to die for. I would highly reckoned this place. The monkey brain was also very good. They were nice and prolly didn't have to wait very long for anything."}
{"text":"Tried the garlic edamame, sunrise roll, salsa dancing roll, and spicy tataki roll. All the fish was fresh and were good portions. However, the base sauce that they put on the plate can be a little over powering to the point that's all you taste. It's not a bad taste, but it can make the flavor of each roll blend together. We got the Bomba for dessert and it was great! One can be split between two people. Overall a good experience and would come back."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never reviewed Kaizen before. It's THE GO TO spot for sushi, especially for those in the service industry as it's open late/early. I've never been disappointed with anything here. My faves are Charlie roll, yellowtail sashimi, and Kai roll. Definite date night spot!"}
{"text":"Just plain perfection. The sexy roll is to die for.  On our last trip to Vegas, we ate at Kaizen three times.  Skip Nobu across the street, and come here instead."}
{"text":"It's off the strip. Affordable. Actually pretty good. 

The number of roll selections here was really overwhelming, but people like their choices. I think it fits the clientele and location perfectly.

If you're right off the strip and don't want to wait for hours getting to some fancy location on the strip, I highly recommend this location to hold you over on a myriad of Japanese-American creations.

Particularly friendly location if you're in town and near the Convention Center as well!"}
{"text":"Dope af must have the rolls.
They have a nice vibe and the location is easy to spot when you are craving for Asian food"}
{"text":"Wow! In Vegas looking for late night sushi, Kaizen was close to where we were so we had to try it! The menu has so many amazing dishes it's hard to choose! We tried the orange blossom roll and it's so good! (And the Salmon deep fried shrimp) highly recommend coming here you won't regret! Friendly staff, parking, fair prices and nice atmosphere! Definitely try this place! We will return!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Oregon and had been here years ago with local & out of state friends. This was our 2nd visit and we love it just as much as the first time.  Everything we ordered was fresh & fabulous!  Great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Walked across the street from HRH for a late lunch Feb 26th, and we're glad we did. Our favorite was the Spicy Rainbow Roll.  We enjoyed the hip music and videos that were on, too."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, fabulous salad and soup.  Peaceful atmosphere.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me & my wifey have been here more than once. First time it was so good. Now this is the 3rd time and it was clearly not the same. Crab Lettuce wraps were not fresh they taste different from the first time. Service was okay could be that it was a little busy.. the cooks are always great."}
{"text":"First time at kaizen. Arriving at around 5am and there are still many people eating. Although it doesn't have an AYCE menu , price is decent and food quality is still great!"}
{"text":"I got the sea bass and tried my friend's unagi rice bowl.

Both were absolutely amazing. The miso glaze on the chilean sea bass was perfection and the piece they gave me was huge! I am happy with my dish."}
{"text":"Go for the avocado train if you're a fan of avocados like I am. From the outside it looks every other strip mall in Vegas. Whether you go 2pm or 2am, it's a funky nite-club with cute decor and great music! 
They are clever with their roll combination.  I can be funny about eating raw fish but this place dishes up some of the freshest seafood. Not bad for being in the middle of the desert!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day and was happy with the food and service.  I had the chicken katsu bowl and an order of California rolls.  Both were good and was a decent portion.  My friends had the kalbi short ribs and the bake muscles.  Both were delicious!  

If you have a sushi craving while in Vegas come here and you wont have to pay the outrageous hotel prices!   Decor was really hip and modern.  They blast hip hop music and have a large projection screen playing music videos while you eat."}
{"text":"Recommend Garden Salad with Ginger Dressing. The dressing is so good. Another one is Fresh water eel chirashi.
However, the waiting time for services takes so long. Not enough waiter and waitress."}
{"text":"I ordered Unagi Chirashi. It's awesome. The portion is bigger than I expected. There are 8-9 slides of unagi with delicious sauce. Price is also reasonable. Recommended! Unfortunately, checking process is tooooooo slow as there is only 1 waiter (who knows everything) handling all table."}
{"text":"All we ordered ( karaage, gyoza, yellow tail, scallop dynamite, jalape√±o poppers & ika yaki, are really tasting good. efl/bdb 6/30/17"}
{"text":"I tried the tiramisu glass for dinner tonight but I didnt expect the ice cream consistency. When it comes to tiramisu, I preferred a warm sponge cake texture better."}
{"text":"Ate here twice while in Vegas- once Friday night around 11pm... Place was packed but still sat down right away. Second time was Sunday around 9- much quieter. Tried 9 different rolls and they were all superb! Pricing is typical for sushi anywhere between $9-$20 per roll. Eat. Here. Now."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi in vegas. You must try the Silver state roll a lot of flavors going on that roll, also the crazy girl roll deep its a deep fried roll. Fast service everything we ordered is good. Try this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! I got the combo and couldn't finish it, and I've never been unable to finish sushi."}
{"text":"Cool place. Friendly servers. Very neat presentation. Food was good. Would bring friends or family or a date is recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at great LV prices. Gotta get the Golden Knights roll and the Ninja roll. You can expect to pay $17-$20 / roll on the strip. Average roll here is about $14. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love this place. I live around the corner so I order from here frequently and everything is always perfect. Best sushi in Vegas! I call in my order and it only takes them about ten minutes to have it ready. The girls who work here are all very sweet. And the prices are amazing!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place was ok at best I think.  Service felt a bit slow (maybe someone called out) and their food was sub par.  Don't get their Karage...it's simply chicken fingers.  Not good at all.  Their rolls are solid enough though.  It's the side dishes that were pretty weak.  I can't remember exactly what rolls we got, but I do remember them being good.  The decor and ambiance is nice though. Although the rolls and decor were nice, it just wasn't enough for me to bump it up to a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"We came here because of the good reviews on yelp. They had good food and good hours. Nice for sushi rolls off the strip!"}
{"text":"Very attentive service with great food.  Had the server suggest a few popular rolls and we were not disappointed.   Clam miso soup, orange blossom and TT rolls were excellent!  Will recommended when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great fast service, awesome selection of speciality rolls. I'm a sushi fanatic and I have no complaints. My favorite was the sunshine roll and the rock and roll roll. Give them a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love good sushi and sashimi. Fresh, the right temp, reasonable portions. I like to taste the fish, not have it hidden and smothered in sauces. 

Kaizen is a great place to go in Vegas. With so many choices in town, this place is a great place to enjoy quality sushi and sashimi. The food is spot on, and the prices are reasonable. The vibe is open and bright. They have the little things like fresh wasabi and know the difference between sushi rice and steamed rice.

The staff was helpful and friendly when I asked for recommendations and navigating the menu. 

I'm not a huge fan of rolls, but they do have a large selection if that's your jam. I had a rice less fish forward roll and it was delicious. 

This place is a solid 5 Star..if you like sushi check it out"}
{"text":"My cousin's don't even live in LV but they have made 5 trips this year mostly because of this restaurant. The fish always tastes fresh and amazing. The service is quick and efficient, and the atmosphere is cute with friendly servers. 

Some great dishes:
-ika yaki: never had anything similar to this at another Japanese restaurant and I'm sort of kind of sad I can only have it here instead of back home (although it is another reason to come back to Vegas..) it's soooo fucking goood. 

- bbq roll: such a diff take on a roll!!! I've gotten it twice now and it's so good. 

- rainbow roll: again, the fish is just so fresh.


I will continue to try diff rolls and update review."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Terrible service.
The restaurant is set up very nicely.  We were seated in an elevated area between two other tables.  We waited about 10 minutes before any employee came by.  We were ready for drinks and to order when a server came to a table next to us (only because a diner at the table hollered for her to stop by).  She almost walked away when one of our diners asked her to come to our table because we were ready to order.  She told us she wasn't our server and would have him come to our table.
A couple minutes later, he arrived.  He suffered through taking our order.  He was writing it down, but we still had to repeat ourselves a couple times.  I had our drink order memorized at that point and slowly said it to him again.  Then we ordered about 7 different items.  We were really worried about getting the right items.  
The food began to come to us, before we got our cocktails.  I chose to wait a couple minutes for my drink before I started eating.  We ordered quite a few items, but I only tried a couple.  The cucumber salad was fresh, crisp and delicious.  I thought the beef sashimi was delicious, but my friend thought it was bland.  I had the chicken teriyaki roll and substituted with soy paper.  I highly recommend it.  Inside the roll is piece of chicken teriyaki, crab, avocado, and cucumber and they are placed on teriyaki sauce.  It was delicious!  The best part was the serving of chicken teriyaki with broccoli, mushrooms, and onions next to the rolls.  
4 cocktails and 7 dishes came out to about 90 dollars; not bad.  The funny thing was, when we wanted our bill, the gal who said she wasn't our server was able to bring us our check when we asked her to have our server do so.  Next time we're in Vegas and want sushi, we'll probably go here, but sit at the bar for more prompt service.
On a funny side note... one of the nearby diners was Carrot Top."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi has been made here:The  calamari roll.

This was my go-to place whenever I had a lunch break. They have good lunch specials. I would always get a katsu bowl ($8.95, I believe for the price).  It is pretty good and my favorite bowl that they have.  I have tried the beef bento-box that they offer but it was not very good.

The service is great, the host is very personable and knows my by name since I used to go there on a daily basis.  

Great atmosphere and the sushi chefs are great people you can have a conversation with!"}
{"text":"Nigiri Sushi, Rolls and Sashimi was OK.  I just disappointed in Shrimp Tempura.  That was not tempura, but fried Shrimp.  Shrimp was fried with banko, I had to ask Tonkatsu sauce.
Rools and plates were beautiful, but I think most of dishes are bit over priced for that quality of fish."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place!  I tried it for the first time this weekend and liked it so much I went back the next night.  They are open late, the sushi tastes wonderful, and the prices are fair.  I can't wait to visit Vegas again so that I can eat here."}
{"text":"i can't believe i'd forgotten to review this place!  i was there last month and was so pleased by my meal here that i couldn't wait to yelp it.  but then i got distracted.  :/  it wasn't until a friend asked for vegas food recommendations that i remembered.  

anyway, this place is SO good!  here are my top 5 reasons for saying that:  

1.  it is open late... as ALL things should be in vegas, and sadly are not.  
2.  it is very reasonably priced.
3.  the traditional sushi is great, but some of the more creative rolls are freakin' rad!
4.  the service is polite and attentive... even in the wee hours of the morning.
5.  it's not quite on the strip but not on the other side of the vegas world either.

my only sad is the it's not in LA.  certainly belongs on my must-eat-there list whenever i am in vegas now."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I forgot to take any pictures. I only eat the veggie rolls so I had avocado rolls and veggie rolls. I also add jalape√±o to them. Not to exotic but very delicious none the less. I also had the delicious garden salad with ginger dressing and avocado. 
  Everyone else had  ninja roll, screaming O, nigiri unagi, monkey brains, t.t. Girls. By the looks of how they devoured everything in sight I trust their rolls must have been fabulous as well. 
  The service was friendly and fast. Drinks were filled as they emptied and they alway checked to see if we were ready to order more food."}
{"text":"I don't even know why we stopped here - we had just gotten done with a food filled day, ending at Dog Haus in the same plaza and I have such a weakness for sushi, I just had to check reviews. Once I saw the great reviews, I couldn't pass it up, no matter how full I was. So we stopped in to sit at the bar and just have a drink and two rolls, rather than my usual boat of sushi and sashimi. We got the Paradise and Ninja rolls and I liked the Ninja Roll, but I loved the Paradise Roll. It's rare that I order rolls, and when I do, I'm always disappointed in the lack of flavor and heat. I'm not a fan of reviewing a place after just getting drinks or just getting an app, but these were both so full of flavor that I just had to add a review."}
{"text":"Stopped thru for late nite craving and was pleasantly surprised. This place is quaint, chill, and the service was on point, very attentive. 
Sampled several of the rolls (had the \"baked Lasagne\" to finish the meal. I was thankful The fish was fresh and decent prices comparable any respectable establishment. I'd recommend if your on this side of town.. I believe they have ayce, but not sure, nice set up w televisions and bar special was half price beer."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating sushi. Absolutely wonderful experience. Great service and very prompt. The location is close to UNLV. Must try and I plan to come again! I recommend the KAI rolls"}
{"text":"Palm Springs roll was very good. The sauce was nice and the rolls didn't just fall apart when picked up.
Tuna poke bowl was good too. Just wished portions were bigger"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for some place quiet and peaceful off the strip and we found it here!! The food was outstanding!!! Along with the service and presentation!!! We had the \"Charlie Roll\" and the Lobster Mango Roll fresh and delicious!!! You should check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Kaizen is a great sushi spot in Vegas that fits right into the lifestyle here as it is open until 4am on weekdays and 6am on weekends.  When I used to work on the strip Friday/Saturday and get off work at 4am we would always hit up this place routinely for some good food and a drink after work to wind down. 

They have a nice sushi bar inside and plenty of tables for small or large groups. The lighting is dimmed a bit and there is always music playing giving off a fun vibe. I've become friends with quite a few of the staff that work here.  Good people, good service. 

The food is really good and the rolls are good sized. They have some great rolls like Silver State, Orange Blossom, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Avacado Train, Super White Tuna is really good too. Everyone I have ever taken to Kaizen from out of state while visiting us has really enjoyed it. 


There are a few Kaizen restaurants in Vegas but this one is by far my favorite. It is located right beside the Hard Rock Hotel 7 Casino.  When or if I start working on the strip at nightclubs again I will definitely be returning to Kaizen on the regular."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  A bit of a wait, but great food and friendly service.  Sake and sushi!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! We were starving and in a hurry. Super fast service and delicious fresh fish! Very nice staff as well. We will be come back"}
{"text":"We will always eat here when we come to Vegas (we come here every year). Unique rolls, traditional rolls, great service and no loud slot machines!"}
{"text":"Sorry fans, this place wasnt all that. The ambiance is good, but the food was mediocre.  The rice felt like it was old, not fresh, and that threw off the rolls. Maybe next time Kaizen!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot whenever I'm out on the strip and craving sushi.  It may not be the most authentic place, but the food is fresh and tasty, service is good, and the prices are extremely reasonable.  The atmosphere is casual and they always have good music playing.  The best part about this place is the fact that they're open really late.  I've been here multiple times and never been disappointed.  Whether it's 7 pm, 12 am, or 5 am, Kaizen is always a good choice."}
{"text":"2 for 1 happy hour from midnight to 4am Sunday to Thursday is great!  Prices are a little higher than I had hoped but they made up for it with the portions there.  Easily the best late night sushi place I've been to in Vegas and I plan on going back soon.  Its closer than \"I Love Sushi\" in Henderson which is my fav so I will just come here when I can't schlep it all the way over there."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I yelped this place when I was staying at the Hard Rock. I was getting extremely tired of eating american food (ie Cheese Fries and Chicken Strips) at Mr. Lucky's 24/7, me and my friend were totally craving for some rice. =) I was confused by the location on the google map because we exited from the back side of the Hard Rock rather than the front and couldn't see any street signs. After walking up and down Paradise Road we finally were able to find the location. It's really easy to find, just make sure you exit the Hard Rock from the front, walk over to the Hard Rock Cafe and walk across the street towards the CVS pharmacy. A few doors down is the Kaizen Fusion Roll and Sushi. =) 

I loved that they were really trendy, with trendy decor (70's looking partitioners that split the tables) and they were playing popular upbeat music that got me back into the mood to party again (I was feeling tired from Rehab, I wasn't feeling up to going to Body English later in the night). =)

We got seated right away, the service the waitresses were giving was very attentive, and we got our food right away. =)

The food was DELICIOUS!!! =)

We shared a tempura roll and edamame (they hook up the edamame!) and the chicken teryiaki bowl. But it wasn't your trypical teryiaki bowl... it tasted stir fried so it definitely added more flavor to the entree! =)

Plus the meal ended up being like $20! Super cheap! =)

Even if I wasn't staying at the Hard Rock Hotel I would still come by here again for Sushi... another bonus to this place is that they are open late! I believe on the weekends they are open until 4 or 5am!

A MUST visit if you're craving for more than just american fried food and don't want to make the drive out of the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"I am staying at the hard rock hotel and it's right across the street so it's a great alternative if you don't want to spend a crazy amount of money at the hotel on the same or sub par foods. I really enjoyed the food and the service was friendly and hospitable. The place itself is decorated nicely and has a good vibe with music and lights. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The fish is very fresh and the service was excellent. The atmosphere was comfortable and we were seated pretty quickly, there were so many choices to choose from and they all tasted very good, the price isn't that bad either!"}
{"text":"Good sushi spot in Vegas with some innovative rolls. The restaurant has a good vibe away from the strip"}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi that I have ever had. The baked tuna shoulder was amazing."}
{"text":"Great restaurant to get away from the hussle of Vegas.  Service is attentive and personable."}
{"text":"We ate here on Sunday night after a hard work day at JCK. I loved how I could pick anything I wanted from there enormous menu. I got the spicy tuna salad for which have tuna poke and seaweed salad along with an actual salad below and there amazing dressing. Worth it. Then I tried special roll which was great and it had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and yellowtail on top. Then I ordered just a basic spicy tuna roll and added cream cheese as  you can do that here. To top it off I have the mochi ice cream which is great! The only reason why this restaurant did not get 5 star is because the service was piss poor. Get more servers as a Sunday night, off the strip with great priced sushi is gonna be busy. Go here if you want some good sushi! :)"}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint! Fantastic sushi and price is decent. The only reason I didn't give it 5 is the service is always abit slow and my appetizer usually comes out half way through my roll. Kinda defeats the purpose of an appetizer."}
{"text":"The first sushi restaurant I met in lv, have a wonderful experience. I order Palm Springs roll and hungry roll.great service. I will come back next time"}
{"text":"It was just ok. Their rolls are creative for sure, but the few that we got just didn't have any special taste to them, they were bland. Nothing to write home about, you can go to many other places around town and get far better sushi for considerably cheaper and have the option of ayce too. The service was on par with the food. Just ok. At $14-17 per roll, I really expected more. I guess it's just a hard rock tourist trap."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced. They were able to accommodate our larger party very quickly which was nice. Service could have been more attentive. Pretty good overall. 

The beef teriyaki bowl & fried chicken sushi roll was really good :)"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Great sushi!! 
Perfect if you're staying at Hard Rock. 

Good prices especially when you consider the location and proximity to hotels here in Vegas. 

Bring friends!"}
{"text":"This is by far the number one sushi joint I have ever been to in my life I've probably been to over 100 sushi bars. There's no comparison!! Unfortunately there is no all you can eat but everything else makes up for it the service is amazing and the food is amazing. I'd recommend the energy roll and sit at the bar for the experience. You also have to get sake bombs.."}
{"text":"After my husband has raved for years about this place, I go a 2nd time to see if I will finally like it. It is AVERAGE. The tastes of rice, crab, fish are pretty flavorless. And the fact that this is not AYCE, their portions should be a lot bigger. This place tastes like an average AYCE place -nothing special. The one nice thing are the hours. At 2 in the morning we wanted sushi and went here. I guess if you're walking by this place and want some sushi, go. But otherwise you are missing absolutely nothing."}
{"text":"Irene and Takky are the best!! They were super friendly and very helpful with recommending food! I would highly recommend the Salmon Killer roll and the Chicken Katsu bowl! I will definitely be back on my next Vegas trip :) Thanks again ladies you were truly amazing!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place thru Groupon since it was close to my work. Rice was undercooked and I had scale in the spicy Tuna roll. Overall, sushi and rolls weren't tasteful much."}
{"text":"In a word? 

Omnomnom...

Wait? Is that a word? It's a sound, for sure. And we made it a lot devouring our dinner at this great place!

Fresh, plentiful, tasty, creative. Oh man. I have a new favorite, fo' sho'. A little slower than some places (as others have pointed out) but worth it, I think. They take their time to make sure it's executed perfectly. Service with a smile and we lacked for nothing. 

The shitake mushroom roll was earthy and perfectly balanced with the crunch of veg and a touch of crispy tempura. Served with some tempura fungi on the side, and it's a complete dish! 

The Rose and White Rose rolls have been entered into my foodporn um, brain bank... ;) No rice (perfect for me): it's amazing fish, sauce, and a touch of veg here and there... WRAPPED IN MORE FISH. #winwin

We also had a soft-shell crab roll (the name escapes me and it's not on the online menu) that was similar. More fish wrapped in fish. Really. #happyMuse

We had a few other rolls, including the Rock and Roll, the Firecracker, a crunchy scallop roll (served with additional panko-breaded scallops! Yum!), and an unagi/avocado roll. All very, very good. The sauces were not overly used - Bonus points! - just enough to go with the flavor profiles they were trying to create. No sauce-drowned fishies here!

To taste the fish on its own (as Bentern says in his review, without the \"tacky\" sauce), we did order some nigiri including salmon, tuna, and uni. The uni, my favorite but not that of my dining companions, was fresh, sweet, and perfect. Always a great sign of a great place, IMHO.

Again I have to point out that I like that they don't pack their rolls with rice (and have a LOT of non-rice options). The menu is *extensive* (the online menu is a fraction of the options you actually have). In addition to the sushi and sashimi, they offer some entrees as well.

I don't mind a lack of AYCE because I don't eat enough to make those \"deals\" worth it. However, I could see the draw in having something here... They can be on the pricey side. That said, Friday night we had a hell of a meal between the three of us... a ton of great food, a couple cucumber salads (meh... just a lot of cucumber in a martini glass... wasn't impressed), some soup, and all those rolls. For... 70ish bucks? Three people? Not bad at all for what you are getting.

And now I am hungry... Dinner, anyone?"}
{"text":"This gem was hidden in a strip, crowded with other food vendors. I ordered take out, as it was right across the street from the hotel I was staying at for business, and I was alone. :( 

I skimmed through the menu for a while, when the server came and asked if I was ready. I asked him to suggest some good rolls, hinting that I loved salmon. He recommended the sunrise roll, so I took that and an order of salmon sushi (2 pcs). 

I went back to my hotel room and was pleasantly surprised. The fish was very fresh and the sushi rice was nicely seasoned. If I am ever back in town, I'd love to try their other food!"}
{"text":"One of my most favorite sushi spots in Vegas. When I'm near the strip I always like to come here. The service is always great and friendly and the food is amazing. My favorite is the Rose Roll (I've attached a photo of it) I'm a huge tuna lover so this one is perfect for me. I also tried the chili crab lettuce wraps tonight and those were really yummy!! They have an awesome happy hour where you buy one alcoholic drink get one free! I'm all about that. If you are near the Hard Rock Hotel, you have to come try it out!! It's open super late too which is great for us industry people."}
{"text":"I really enjoy d this Sushi restaurant.  I went at lunchtime.The food at served d quickly. The waiter was friendly but didn't tell me of daily specials and promotions. I thick any restaurant who offers special should start with them at the opening. This isn't an AYCE, so go as a group if on a budget."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and even more fantastic rolls. I recommend Kaizen to all my friends and family! Be sure to get the deep fried cheesecake. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Uni was the only thing fresh to me
 Service was great. Just old fish not as fresh. For me i will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The beef tataki is so good, only place I've seen this dish and I loved it. Sunday through Thursday happy hour 12 - 4,  BOGO all alcohol."}
{"text":"The perfect spot for your late night sushi craving! We came a bit late (pass 3am) and still got greeted with smiles. The service, the ambience is great here and the food is amazing! It totally worth going off the strip for this one! Thank you Kaizen, we'll definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"This place is the worst.  I saw a cockroach running out of the kitchen and i don't blame him.  Same old strip mall sushi you can find on any streetcorner these days."}
{"text":"Love Kaizen I come here after work and fish is always fresh ... :) Avocado train is what I order every time can't get enough of it. It's delicious !! Service is great"}
{"text":"my cousins, friends, and i each ordered the two for one drink special and shared a couple large hot sakes. in addition to our drinks, we ordered the calamari roll, kalbi rib roll, crazy boy roll, and a tako appetizer that also had cucumbers and vinegar (i forget it's name). we thoroughly enjoyed our late night meal! i love how pieces of what is in the roll is also on the side, so you can tell what you are eating and enjoy more food! also, when we were ready for our bill, our waitress told us that we still had one more beer from the two for one special. she didn't have to do that!"}
{"text":"Freshest fish. Perfectly steamed edamame (not mushy). Great service. Oh, and ORANGE BLOSSOM ROLL.

That is all you need to know."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Came back two days in a row since we enjoyed it so much! The salmon cheese stick appetizer is super yummy. There is a good selection of rolls. I enjoyed the Unicorn the most. Great teriyaki as well, and better than your typical. 
The service and atmosphere is great for families and date nights. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone, and am sad that we don't live closer."}
{"text":"I found this place using yelp during our recent visit to Vegas.  The great part about this place is the late hours.  Me and my hubby was hungy at a late hour so I yelp the place and was pretty satisfied with the place.  Service was awesome.  It's close by the strip.  Awesome sushi and good food.  I would definitely go back there when visiting =)"}
{"text":"WOW!
So many choices of tools to choose from!
If you are looking to try many different types of sushi this is the place"}
{"text":"I love this place and frequent it regularly. It's perfect for industry folks who get out of work late because of their late night hours. Service is always friendly and quick. Their happy hour is awesome too. My favorite dish there is the Pepper Seared Tuna with Crispy Onions. Yum"}
{"text":"I was craving sushi during a business trip in Vegas, and feeling super jetlagged and exhausted i just wanted something quick for takeaway before passing out for the night. Kaizen got great reviews and was a quick drive from my hotel, so I called in an order and popped in. The food was okay, but not great. The sushi felt like it wasn't very fresh and it was completely warm by the time I got it home (to be fair, it was 100 degrees outside but the car ride was only 5 minutes and the AC was on... so I don't think that could have been the culprit!). Maybe eating in is a better bet for the future."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal and open super late night.  The quality is breathtaking and it won't break the bank.   I strongly urge you to try the kiss of fire.  They say it's super spicy but it's perfect and not to hot.  There are more expensive sushi places, I'm looking at you Nobu, but they aren't worth the extra scratch.  Come here when in Vegas.  It's across the street from the hard rock and it's skipping distance to the double down saloon.  Great service and great ambience.  Come hungry! The portions are big.  

Also don't just focus on the awesome sushi, their dinner plates, particularly the fresh fish, are worth ordering and are quite memorable."}
{"text":"First time here. We wanted to try a fresh roll and a baked dish. We were not disappointed. Service was also excellent! Would return."}
{"text":"Their sauce was amazing. The best sushi I've had so far. After a long night of drinking I was shocked to see they were still open. They did NOT disappoint I can tell you that"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come every time I am in Vegas. I have brought lots of friends there and now they do the same. The sushi is great and the prices are fair. The garlic edamame is to die for. I can't get enough!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad. I found it late night and decided to sit at the bar. I usually NEVER sit at the bar, but it looked inviting , and very casual, it was a friday night, around 11pm or so. They were playing techno music, I actually like the atmosphere. My date and I came in a for quick bite, and this was pretty fast and not very expensive. Both time that I have been there it has not drained my wallet for what i got. 1st time here i got a shrimp tempura roll ( 7bucks), not bad. and a cucumber roll(4 bucks). My date got the shrimp killer. ( around 8). Not bad at all. 

Second time I went i ordered to go, and I got a vegetable tempura roll,(7bucks) which i found to be VERY GOOD! They put avocado in it. I tried the spicy scallop roll, but I did not care for it. It has some kind of a red mixture, somewhat like tomato. I dont know. I have had better. Everything else was very good!.
Shrimp tempura roll. vegetable tempura roll. scallop roll, cucumber roll all came out to 24 dollars to go. I know i dont order extravagant rolls but thats cause im allergic to some of the stuff in those. So for me veggies rolls are wonderful. Ill prob come back again, because they pay attention to my fish allergy.
I come here alone sometimes after work, and I never feel weird. The sushi chefs talk to me, and they said they would remember my allergy if I came back, that makes me feel SO GREAT!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this late night sushi place and after 5 hours of playing blackjack I was grateful to find a decent sushi place open after 2am.  All the other late night sushi places seem to close at 2.  Sat down at the bar, at 3:10am the place was surprisingly seated with about 10 other late night eaters. I ordered 2 rolls: King of Ocean Roll (topped with lobster, shrimp, tangy sauce and contained avacodo, asparagus, cucumber) & Sunrise Roll (salmon,avacodo on top, with spicy tuna inside and ponzu sauce).  The food was satisfying and tasted fresh, moreover very satisfying.  Service was friendly and prompt, 2 young Japanese sushi chefs working at the bar preparing the sushi.  Waitresses were young and cute, overall a very satisfying experience and exactly what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty decent and the atmosphere was nice but they're serving AYCE-grade fish (we all know the difference) at high-end fresh fish cost. I don't mind paying a la Carte prices when the fish is high quality and worth it. Go to the Kaizen on Eastern, where they do AYCE with the same fish and menu, that way you're not paying $50 for 2 mediocre rolls just because of location."}
{"text":"Thank you Kaizen for the great meal that was needed before our night out dancing. Michael was our server and we applaud him for putting up with us...he was attentive and laughed at our bad jokes. The ambiance wasn't too casual and not too fancy, which was perfect even though we were pretty dressed up. The sushi was DELICIOUS, fresh and nicely prepared. Two girls in our party ordered the miso soup with lobster and loved it. The sushi we ordered was great and filling. The best part about this place was that it wasn't that busy. We assumed it would get busier later into the night, since they are smart and stay open until 6am. 

I plan on returning again to this cute spot off the strip when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Let me tell you the BBQ roll is spectacular. I felt like a little baby Buddha was dancing on my tongue. This place is awesome and they even surprised us when they told us that starting at 12am  they had buy one sake get one free. Sake Bombs here we go"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot because they have great food. I like them even more because they're open late. I've been here a few times after a night out on the strip, I don't know how exactly, but I've made it. I've had rolls and noodles and have enjoyed both with friends.

However, after coming here for a late night [sober] dinner recently I came to realize it really is a good sushi spot away from the strip. Especially since they have great deals - it was half off when we went for dinner.

It's good food, a great deal, chill atmosphere and great service. I must admit though, that i give them extra props for being open late and still delivering great service at such a late hour."}
{"text":"I walked over to get sushi from here and it was quick and easy. They have quite an extensive menu and the prices are very reasonable. I got the crab salad, Hard Rock Roll, and King of Ocean Roll. I don't feel like the crab salad was very flavorful, and they other rolls were good but nothing that I thought that was better than other sushi that I have had."}
{"text":"What a great surprise! In here our first time and the ambience, rolls, service and lighting was great!!
Loved the rolls and loved the late hours they're open."}
{"text":"average sushi and rolls, prices are a little bit on the pricey side... but not too bad.

i guess i went on the wrong night or something cus it was pretty crowded with only two waitresses. service was mediocre... it took me reminding the waitress and even the bus boy 3 times for hot sauce!! ughhh..... i was practically almost done with my rolls by the time i got it.

i even heard the table next to us ask the waitress if they were short on waitresses bc no one has taken their order..... :|"}
{"text":"Food is is good, staff is friendly and helpful.  Raspberry sake is bomb good!!! One place I always stop in when in town"}
{"text":"Came here after another restaurant was busy. Couldn't have been more pleased. The food was great, and the service was great. 

I'd happily come here again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas! The menu is incredible and hard to choose from. They have pictures of all rolls with helps you to decide. Absolutely the most delicious sushi!! Avocado train, golden knights, tune crispy rice, salmon killer my favorites!"}
{"text":"Easy to miss. Great food and service. Many items on the menu. So much to choose from. A must to go"}
{"text":"A great solid place for sushi, and even better for lunch. The bento boxes are probably the best deal on the menu in terms of quality, quantity and price. The thing that threw me off was the tempura shrimp bento was solid minus the tempura part. Instead of traditional tempura batter, they used the same batter as that of the chicken katsu which was a big let down for me as it was not as I had expected. My girlfriend had the pork katsu which bowl which was excellent as I picked off her plate as well as mine. If your in the area, give this place a try. I do hope though the tempura shrimp thing was a fluke and it was because they ran out of the proper batter. Otherwise, it would be a big strike against them as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"Love this place! The bbq roll is amazing and that Salsa Dancing Girl roll...  so delicious."}
{"text":"This is off the strip so it was decent.  It's located inside a plaza like corner with CVS, hookah joint and some other restaurant/stores.  The waitresses here were friendly and sat us down very quickly.  I ordered the rose roll and something else I forgot but it was good.  I do feel like it was a place to pick up hookers or something..."}
{"text":"Terrible that they don't tell customers that its not all you can eat!!!! Unlike the other restaurants named Kaizen. And aside from that took foreverrrrr for someone to approach us after we got seated & it wasn't even busy.  Food is Great though so its all worth it haha."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it's still great. Fresh fish, huge creative rolls and friendly customer service. They are open late and the atmosphere is sleek but not snobby. I've never had a bad experience at Kaizen. One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer satisfaction ... I don't say customer service because Kaizen sushi goes above just serving their customers they anticipate and satisfy every craving you might have..the sushi is phenomenal and the friendly smiles and sincerity  is beyond expectation... I am always so pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and mastership of their craft that i am left euphoric every time i eat here"}
{"text":"Came here randomly late on a Tuesday - the service and decor was good, but the sushi (rainbow roll and kiss of fire) blows. Will definitely not return!"}
{"text":"Decent rolls for a decent price.  I would put this on the same level as some of the sushi spots i frequent in the Bay Area.

What puts this place apart is that they're open late, till 6 in the morning!  Also, i was impressed with the service.  We ordered miso soup,  tempura & sushi and got our food in the correct order!  Its a win-win!"}
{"text":"Yup! Super good. Highly recommend the \"sexy roll\" good roll, great sauce. Late night happy hour for late night revellers. 

Buy one get one for ALL ALCOHOL from midnight to 4am sun thru Thursday."}
{"text":"Happy hour is awsome here on weekdays !!!  They open late till 4am !!!  Good place to come eat sushi and hangout with friends !!!"}
{"text":"Ended up coming here with a date to avoid the crazy New Years crowd on the strip! I was recommended to come here by one of the pit bosses while gambling. They had stated that this pale was open until 6 A.M. which was a major plus since It was past midnight at that point. Ended up getting to the restaurant around 1. We started off with a bottle of sake called \"nothingness\" which was pretty good. (Sweeter cold sake) The food was absolutely amazing, everything was fresh and delicious. The service was also very good! Since it was considered happy hour at that time they brought us an extra bottle of sake on the house. It was only a 5 minute cap ride from Planet Hollywood here which wasn't bad at all. I initially had doubts about this place number one because it was off the strip and number 2 because it was open so late, but I am glad I ended up coming here as oppose to anywhere else. The vibe was also very good. A nice place to take a date. For it being a sushi restaurant in Vegas the price was very reasonable, I was expecting it to be about doubled what I ended up paying! I will definitely come back here next time I am in town! I can easily say it is one of the top 5 sushi spots I have been too!"}
{"text":"How we found out about this place....amazing....

Kara and I decided to leave my boyfriend at the hotel for a girl on girl bonding dinner shennanigan.
I remember i was drunk...and emotional. and drunk.... and a limo driver gave us a free ride. 
He asked me where i wanted to go to. I said. SUSHI.

And luckily, without any attempt of harm, or kidnap or rape...we made it safely to the sushi spot...in a LIMO.

fly!

Tip: Girls. we just got lucky our limo driver isn't a douchebag. But do not attept to hop in, to any limo just because it's a dashing limo..I didn't think at that point. Thank god we didn't get killed in our short skirts.

Anyway....

So...my girlfriend and I ...along with our drunken hungry stomachs..ordered so much sushi, which we devoured in less than an hour....

Service on a saturday night was great. No long wait. and they are really friendly.

I had to take my boyfriend here....so we came back here on Monday...again....

What i've tried here so far..i really did like...

here we go: (this is from two nights of being here)

*First Kiss: Deep Fried Shrimp topped with soft shell crab, tuna and white fish. 
It comes with a subtle tangy sauce with a flavor that's just about right without overpowering the natural flavor and tast of the fish.

*The \"O\" Roll: Chopped deep fried soft shell crab, spicy tuna and avocado, topped with Yellowtail. 
As the name says.... This is a full blown Orgasm in your mouth. Definitely a must try. It gave me multiples. I had to order this twice.

*Palm Springs Roll: OMG. This is an orgasm within an Orgasm.
Cubed Tuna in Spicy Mayo and Ponzy Sauce galore, with crab, avocado and cucumber. Soooo Goooooood. This is really amazing.
We ordered this on our two nights we were at Kaizen.

*Kiss of Fire: If you like Spicy...you'll love this roll. Inside: there's crab, avocado and cucumber... Topped with Spicy Tuna, White Fish, Jalapeno. Sauce: spicy garlic ponzu and hot sauce..... Down this with Asahi or a shot of Sake. you're good.

*Kaizen Roll: Who doesn't agree that anything deep fried is just oh. so . good??? and unhealthy? whatever sushi pooper. This roll is a must try as well. IN: Deep fried soft shell crab, lobster, avocado, asparagus, yamagobo,cucumber, radish sprouts.. Topped with Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. sauce: eel sauce.

*Chicken Teriyaki Bowl: Even their Chicken Teriyako Bowl is not ordinary. It's yuuuummmmy!!!!

What i like about this Sushi Joint is that...it's not over-rated and doesnt try to be fancy shmancy like other sushi joints on the strip. They keep their quality and deliver freshness fish after fish..after fish. Service is fast and excellent. Prices are decent. Fish cuts are thick and generous. Selection is different and unique.

Definitely recommend this place to Sushi Lovers in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The girlfriend and I decided to try this place since we were craving sushi and it was walking distance from our hotel. The food was mediocre. We will probably not try this place again."}
