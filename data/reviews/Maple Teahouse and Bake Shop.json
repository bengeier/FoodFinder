{"text":"This place is a true gem including product and costumer service. It is run by a persian family (I think) who greeted my friend and I with an abundance of generosity even considering we were dressed poorly after just come back from the pool and gym. In the fridge area they have a myriad of exquisite pastries and sweets ALL freshly made IN STORE. They are made by a lady who actually served us and a proffessional toronto pastry chef who works for them 3 days a week. They had traditional sweets and many sweets from around the midddle east from turkish delights to baklava (a variety of flavours of course). We also had a look and taste of their tea menu, there was a PLETHORA of teas and a standard menu of coffee related beverages. As far as the ambiance the store is beautifully decorated with gorgeous persian rugs creating a runway for the customer, relaxing and in my opinion chosen in good tase paintings. Also something that I think gets taken for granted and that more stores need are INDOOR PLANTS, of course they had a few which adds more life and serenity to the space. Also they gave me and my friend (poorly dressed teenagers) a complimentary slice of chocolate cake and it was absolutely delicious. The prices were fair, the service was extremely hospitable, the food and tea was delicious and the space is overall relaxing and unique. Deserves every 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Very cute place, good for catching up with a friend. The lady working there was very friendly."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend to pick up some treats and it was the cutest little gem of Aurora!! If you are looking for something to do, come here! There was lots of seating and the treats were so fresh. The service was absolutely outstanding and so kind. Not sure if they do catering, but if so I would definitely look into it. I will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"This is clearly a family run business, and it shows.

Very decent coffee (I've had a latte with no sugar, and enjoyed every note of the coffee - shows the quality of the beans), with tasty sandwiches (tried the roast beef), and nice pastries to take home.

Will repeat, if the opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"Heaven under glass. I walked in the doors Ana walked up the long center aisle with the sound of angels singing and beams of sunlight dancing on a pair of large glass cases filled with a bear endless variety of heavenly treats. 

This is a new place, not part of a chain, and decidedly different. From what I could deduce, many of the desserts in the cases were Mediterranean. There had to be a dozen different varieties of baklava alone. Many of the other treats had very Greek sounding names. 

I fought for self control and picked only two items for a first try, especially after a massive lunch and an impending dinner. They were incredible!  I should have just stayed parked, since it was torture waiting for the next stop light so I could have another bite.  In fact, all I remember about the drive was every stop light. Strange."}
{"text":"This caf√© is spacious with simple wooden furniture.  The plants that sit around in the restaurant give the ambiance a lively kick.  Love their coffee; rich aroma and strong flavor.  Their kokakia (cream puff) and pistachio maple cake roll are both delicious.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe with nice ambience and a friendly owner. Their pistachio maple roll is definitely worth a try! It's the perfect balance being not too filling and not too sweet."}
{"text":"This local pastry will satisfy your sweet tooth cravings! 

We were around the area and decided to get some pastries for take-out! We were greeted promptly and the baker/cashier were very friendly. There were endless selections from mouth watering tiramisu to buttery cookies.

The place had a modern appeal and pretty spacious. You can bring a large group of friends and enjoy your coffee/tea & relax. They also have free Wi-Fi, so that's a plus !  

We got 6 mini cakes ($2.75 each) and the 6 cookies (6 for $5). I had the tiramisu cake - it was delicious ! It had a strong coffee taste but doesn't overwhelm the overall sweetness of the cream and sponge cake. The butter cookies with pistashico were pretty good- buttery & sweet ! Love it! 

The baker/owner also gave us a chocolate chip muffin on the house! It was freshly baked, so it was nice and warm :)  Yummy! Woohoo for freebie ! 

Next time I'm around the area, I want to dine in to try their savory food items!"}
{"text":"Finally! A worthy bakeshop/teashop.  As reported by other reviewers, this is a family run, featuring pastries that are made daily.  The atmosphere is very clean and modern, spacious.  I would say this place is family friendly, date friendly, single and solo friendly... friendly is the word. I'm planning to be back repeatedly to try all the things.  Not too sweet!"}
{"text":"Nice place to sit for a while. There's a lot of room in the store so it's a good place to have a conversation. Although the walls are somewhat blank and doesn't give off the cozy vibe that I'd expect of cafes.

Their selection of baked goods is limited, just a lot of  baklava."}
