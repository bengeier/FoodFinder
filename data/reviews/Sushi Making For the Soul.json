{"text":"Now that I know a bit more distinction and variety of sushi and how to roll rookie-style Hosomaki, Temaki and Uramaki...  I can make special ones like Raisinmaki, Mango-coconutmaki, and even YELPmaki.

\"Sushi Making for the Soul($30+)\" is a beginners course that was educational and hands-on for a couple hours, well worth the cost for kids/parents, bf/gf, and people that like sushi...

My friend falls into the liking sushi category, so much so that she would make it her last meal on earth.  I gave her the chance to like it so much she can learn about the food category that she has 100+ reviews on.

Master Sushi Chef, Shin Aoyama, and Sushi Impresario Sang Kim were very open to questions and corrected/commented some people's sushi-rolling techniques.  If you want to know how my friend did, you can know by seeing that her photo post of the Makis were all MY creations.   :P"}
{"text":"Recently I have started taking cooking classes. The first item on my list that I wanted to learn how to make was sushi. I eat it often enough, why not make it for myself? But come on! Let's be realistic here. Sure, there are many things that I like to eat, many of which I could probably make myself, but actually go through all the trouble? Not likely. But I was hoping it would be different with sushi. Plus, I was looking to impress friends at my next gathering by showing them my sushi creations. \"Oh yeah! I made that. FROM SCRATCH!\"

My friend and I had a great time in this class. I particularly enjoyed hearing about the history of sushi and like a big kid I got a kick of getting my hands dirty while I attempted to make the different types of rolls. I do suggest however that you invite friends/family to take this class with you. In this class you are bound to have a great time and learn a great deal because everyone was so friendly and Sang is very sociable, yet I feel that it will be a better experience for you if you partake on this sushi-making adventure with people you can be silly with. As my friend pointed out to me during the class as I pushed myself to make the 'best roll' in the class....\"Itanni relax. Just have fun!\" And I did have fun."}
{"text":"What's better to express my love of Japanese food by attending a Sushi Making class... When my Yelp buddy told me about \"Sushi Making for the Soul\", I am IN!! 

\"Sushi Making For the Soul\" ($30) is not only an opportunity to learn about the detailed and intricate art of sushi-making, it's also a way to help those affected by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. 

The event took place at Liberty Noodle which was really informative and it was so much fun with hands on sushi making that resulted in sushi that only myself enjoyed eating...(Think how it is in a kid's handicraft class!) 

Master Sushi Chef, Shin Aoyama, and Sushi Impresario Sang Kim did a wonderful job in making the evening entertaining and enjoyable... After attending I now know some basic history and knowledge about sushi and I know how to roll up some rolls just like a \"Master Sushi Chef\".

The good thing is the proceeds are directed to Doctors Without Borders, Second Harvest, and the Japanese Red Cross. 

Future events are in the making.. and they going to have a single event... What's better to get to know other singles that are interested in sushi and get to know each other with Shari rice stuck to the fingers!"}
