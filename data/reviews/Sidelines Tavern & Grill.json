{"text":"Making your way in Chandler today, takes everything you've got. Taking a break from all your hunger, should would help a lot. Wouldn't you like to get some wings? Sometimes you want to go where Megan knows your name. And she's always glad you came. You wanna be where kids eat free (Thursday), and the patrons are all the same. You wanna be where the bartenders know your name."}
{"text":"Service was pretty inattentive, even with 2 people behind the bar and only 5 patrons sitting at the bar. I asked for a menu, which came quickly, but it was over 10 minutes before anyone asked if I wanted to order anything. The women bartenders seem to spend most of their time chatting with the few regulars.  This was 5pm on a Monday, so who knows....."}
{"text":"Sidelines is a great place to come with friends, family, or by yourself. The service is outstanding!  They also have great food and drink specials. Sidelines also has trivia, poker, and a nice outside patio with misters. I would recommend Sidelines to everyone."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Place has had some nice changes. The outdoor patio looks great. I like the burgers I get here usually. Service was a little lax, but they did a good job on my tea glass."}
{"text":"Do you ever want to experience a home grown bar?  This is the place to be, great deals, great hospitality by the main waitress Meaghan, and great food.  They have revamped the menu, I would suggest the wings (Heather Hot flavor) especially if you want to start sweating the pours from drinking the night before.  The booths have TV's, so if you bring your kids, they can watch Hannah Montana.  There is this crazy promo that if you mention them on yelp, next time you come in, you get free pitcher of Kilt Lifter, you would think it is a bit of bribery, but Sidelines needs no bribery when the food is hot, drinks are cold, and the waitresses are even hotter!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times last time beer was totally flat. I came here tonight bar wasn't packed it's a Thursday and was greeted I walked outside because it's a decent night out and sat outside for 30 min with no one coming to take an order or ask me if I wanted anything. Going to spend my money at another bar instead. Wouldn't recommend this bar any more."}
{"text":"We went to Sidelines on Friday, Sept. 28, 2012. We  had a coupon from entertainment.com and showed to to our waitress. She said the coupon was valid and we could use it for what we ordered. We ordered fish & chips and a fish sandwich meal which was mediocre at best. After we ate and received the bill the waitress told us due to the computer not accepting our coupon we had to pay full price on the bill. It would have been nice to know this beforehand. The excuse about the computer was a pretty lame excuse. Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"Was contacted by the owner and given a free meal. I must state that we have come here many times after this first review, and have had a great time. This time was a bit awkward. Great greeting upon arrival but yes slow service. I really didn't mind as I was in no hurry, and it was not a \"prime\" time for food. Had a great time chatting with hubby. Ordered our food and was good but really could have been timed better by the kitchen. Mashed taters were half warmed as was the roast beef. Didn't try hubby's wings but half order was taken home. In these off hours of business have one extra on hand. Mom is a great asset but kinda got lost after the bill. We will be back , but during peek times when service is there. Add an extra server it will pay off. BTW I never saw anyone going to the patio where there were at least 8 people there. An extra server could have brought $200 per hr on them......."}
{"text":"I want to really like Sidelines.  I live so close.  The grilled wings are fantastic.  Best I've ever had, so big too!  The hamburgers are great too.  I've had the philly cheesesteak, but where's the beef!  Lots of bell pepper and onions, not worth the money.

Fairly clean but just look at the trash can by the drink station and kitchen and you wonder if the rest of the kitchen is that grimy.

The biggest problem is the atmosphere.  Like I said I really want to like this place but they overly cater to their \"regulars\", at the expense of the new or occasional guest.  You can definitely feel ignored, like your business is not that appreciated...and I tip really well!"}
{"text":"Rating is this high because it meets my expectation for what it is.  Reasonable prices and a good atmosphere for a local drinking spot.  Barstaff (Jessica in particular, in case management is listening....) really makes it worth coming back.  She is always energetic and friendly to everyone that sits at the bar.  Wings are decent, I just wish they would come out a little quicker.  I think if I stick to beer at Jessica's bar, my rating will stay high. 
Side note:  please, please, please bring the Devil's Ale back!"}
{"text":"Terrible food, slow service with attitude. Don't waste time or money on this place. Ordered two appetizers, both disgusting. The smell and taste of old grease was awful. Ordered a coke and beer. The coke was just soda water. Told the waitress and she said, \" I know, we are busy.\"  How about serve us water and say the coke needs to be changed. I guess they are use to serving SLOP."}
{"text":"Stopped in late Sat afternoon to watch the Nebraska Ohio St. football game.  Asked if we could get a tv out of something like 12 tvs for that game.
Nothing.  Then had to reason with them and was told they would have 1 on but no volume.
The place was not packed.
Drank our water and didn't order and walked out to a customer service recommended place to watch the game without anyone being rude.
Will not step foot in this place ever.
Stop telling me I haven't made any changes."}
{"text":"Personable, cold beer & good company. We enjoy coming in, kids love spaghetti & they have a special of baked chicken sandwich with green chili that is fabulous! Cheese curds are ok (says the girl from Wi) so normal people will love them!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night since it's close to our house and we were in the mood for a beer and some bar food.  Upon arrival, we thought this might be a place we would frequent again, given the sports bar type atmosphere and age group that looked like we fit in to.  By the time it was all said and done, we decided probably not....it wasn't bad really, but food was just average and the atmosphere ended up being a bit odd.

Waitress was over pretty quickly and was a dead ringer for Kirsten Dunst - super cute and spunky blonde.  I ordered a Miller Lite draft which was on special for $2.50 - awesome!  Hubby ordered a Dos Equis...not on special, but fine.  We then decided to order food and I went with the Bleu Burger which was on the wall as the daily special and came with fries.  It was a burger with bleu cheese, bacon and grilled onions.  Hubby ordered sliders and a side of fries. Food came out after what seemed to a bit long, given it was not crowded at all.  After I was into my burger about 4 bites, I realized it didn't have bacon on it.  Didn't want to send it back and I was hungry, so I kept biting away and eating it.  Burger was middle of the road...  Hubby said the sliders were the same and he thought that the ones at Uncle Bear's were better.  

The atmosphere here was a bit \"off\".  I think the music was coming from a 1985 boom box from behind the bar.  There were speakers everywhere, but it was coming from one direction and wasn't good sound quality.  It also was barely audible and that's saying something because I don't really love super loud music.  TV's were all around and very nice.  Booths had their own personal TV (we didn't sit at one of these, as they were all taken when we walked in).  I also thought it odd that several people brought there kids here.  We had a 3-4 year old sitting next to us and there were 2 other tables where parents brought young kids....to a bar.  Isn't that what Red Robin is for?  

All in all, not horrible, not great.  I'd say it's a place I'll keep to the Sidelines (put intended)."}
{"text":"The food is good here and the service is good but slow, this is one reason for the 4stars the other is I'm not big on wings and that is their specialty.  

Still a nice place to go."}
{"text":"I would agree with most commenters that that the service here is sub standard (unless you sit at the bar).. However the grilled wings are hands down THE BEST and the single best reason to keep going back."}
{"text":"Had been here a few times in the past and the food was okay. Went back last week to have a beer and grab a bite to eat. Ordered the Steel Curtain sandwich which claimed to have loads of corned beef. when my sandwich arrived it looked like something I would get at a school lunch and they wanted $10 for this week attempt at food. The server said she would speak to the manager and have her come by my table. 30 minutes later the manager finally arrives and proceeds to argue about being short staffed and that I should just be happy with the food I received. after further discussion I was told they would take the sandwich off the bill as the manager huffed and walked away. this place has gone downhill in a big way! I will not be back and I do not recommend this place for anything but alcohol and maybe not even that."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I certainly would. Not only did our waitress not check back with us after dropping off our food until she was leaving the check- she picked her nose right in front of us. The sandwich I ordered was sent out wrong, but since she never came back I couldn't say anything until it was time to pay, she then proceeded to take the food away - not offer a fix- and charged me for food I couldn't eat. 

When I emailed the company their reply was if you had told us we would have gladly fixed it!!!!
Seriously- who was I to tell when not even the waitress came back to the table. Never have I been in an establishment that had so little disregard for their guests.  I was also informed that their upper management was in the location at the time I received such poor service.

Horrible experience all the way around!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good (average) but the service is the worst Iv ever experienced. Will never go back simply because of that. Our server would roll her eyes if we asked a question about the menu items and she sighed with annoyance when we waived her over for a refill  after our drinks had been empty for 15 min or so."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. Fist two times sat at the bar, had a few drinks and enjoyed my time. Bar tenders were friendly, and accommodated everything we could ask for. 

My friend told me about a wing day here so we decided to go. An now why the low rating:

Waitress sucked! We gave our order. Before food came out she gave us a bill that didn't belong to us. We needed to waive her down from standing around to get refills. When the food came out(wings) she got my entire order wrong (because she didn't write it down). The fixed the order...but by time I got my order my friend had finished their meal already. Wings were good, not great. We waited for appx 40 minutes after done eating for bill to see that out amazingly intelligent waitress also tried to overcharge us. Horrible waitress. 

If you go: sit at bar."}
{"text":"I have lunch at sidelines on a regular basis. I don't think I have ever had an issue with the food. The wings are very good and the burgers, sandwiches and salads have always been good.  Megan makes everyone feel welcome as soon as they come in the door. I really like how quickly I can get in and out since I only have a short lunch break.  I highly recommend the place, at least for lunch, Sidelines is about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"There are dive bars then there are just nasty messy bars with bad food and service. This sadly would be the latter. There are lots of great spots near here but would recommend skipping this one."}
{"text":"We were driving through on vacation, and our friend recommended we get some beers and watch the hockey game there. He has been there before, and said the food and drinks were great. He ended up changing his mind on the restaurant by the end of our visit. There weren't many customers, but the service was crazy slow. Each of our orders were wrong. And the kicker: my husband found a hair in his sandwich. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Wings are hot, beer is cold and they have the baseball package with a huge tv over the bar. Why more do you need? Megan the bartender is awesome and will never let your glass sit empty.....great attitude as well."}
{"text":"First time I have ever been here.

This is a dive bar.  And let me tell you, I sure love dive bars.  Their wings are delicious.  Some of the best wings I have ever had in Arizona.  

We went on a Sunday on a Groupon deal so we splurged for wings and 2 burgers plus beer.  The pints were well priced but they didn't have a large selection though.

The burgers we had were delicious.  I had the \"Hot Burger.\"  It was the special for the day and was only $7 and change for a huge burger and a large helping of steak fries.  The wings we had were the sweet chili.  Yum.

The service was real good.  They were very attentive and speedy.  The atmosphere was nice and I was more than comfortable at the bar for my first time there.  TVs everywhere and what was cool was that there were TVs in each booth!  Pretty sweet.

Would definitely return to bar for some good bar food and some brewskis."}
{"text":"I went to watch the world cup final. Cheap drinks, a lot of TV's (several Big screen, and each both has it's own Screen as well). Service was ok (considering the place was full), but the food was terrible."}
{"text":"I thought it was kinda weird to have wings Tuesday & taco Wednesday!  but after trying these GRILLED honey hot wings....OMGOODNESS...I'm in love with these #wings!!!
Now I have to come back for taco Wednesday!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for lunch and we split a burger and tater tots. Average bbq burger. Nothing to brag about. We were in and out pretty quickly. I'd come here again to meet my husband for lunch. 
The service wasn't slow but it wasn't quick either. They were pretty nice and quick to the point."}
{"text":"Best wings in town. Great service. Support local businesses! The owner is so pretty and sweet. A lot of regulars. Reminds me of Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my boyfriend, we liked it but there could also be change that would make it better. We sat ourselves and the table was sticky, our waitress came over we ordered drinks, she came back with my drink & his water but forgot his beer. We ordered some appetizers and the wings and cheese curds were awesome, than at that time I finally asked for his beer which they didn't charge us for. We got our food & my pork sandwich wasn't too good, the bread was stale & the pork tasted old, he got a burger and said it was okay. We will be back one more time to decide if it was maybe a bad day for them."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We should've known by the yelp reviews, but figured we'd give it a try anyways. The TV in our booth was nice, but not enough to compensate for the bland, over cooked food and server with an attitude. Sidelines of Chandler was NOTHING like our beloved Sidelines of Brunswick Ohio! Will not be back."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed on our last visit to Sidelines on 11/10. There were 3 of us total, and we sat outside. We wanted to have the heater on beside us, but it wasn't working so our waitress said she'd send someone out to look at it. Nobody ever came out... The service was REALLY bad and when our food came out it was like it had been sitting there, done, for too long as it was only lukewarm. The food still continues to be great though, flavor wise, which is why we always go back. I just wish they would get some more servers in or something."}
{"text":"We stopped in on our motorcycles last Saturday afternoon. Not too busy. There is a lot of TV's. We could watch the Cubs while we ate some wings. I have to say these are some of the best wings I've had in the Phoenix Metro area. Make sure you get them grilled. Good variety of sauces and the staff was friendly and responsive. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went for the first time ever on a random Tuesday night.  4 words, I will be back. Really nice crew led by Jessica behind the bar.  Place was very lively and lit, perfect for a sports bar.  

I just stopped in to see the place, and the staff kept me there for for well over an hour.  

Great work, see yall soon!"}
{"text":"I see other people calling this a dive bar, to which I disagree with. To me a dive bar is a place to go and drink for cheap and there is very little else to do than drink (maybe pool, an old juke box, or shuffleboard).

To me, Sidelines is a sports bar... hence the sports reference in it's name.

I'll be honest, I really don't like Sidelines. Every time I walk in I feel like I'm not wanted. I've gone when it's busy, when it's dead, alone, with a group, when an event is on, and when nothing is going on. I feel like the staff just doesn't really care if I am there. I feel like I am in Scottsdale where if I am not belching and acting like a total jackass, I will get no service. 

The food has never wow'd me. Not at all. Ever.

Sure the screens are nice to watch some events on... but I'd much rather got to Zipps or tilted Kilt to watch."}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good.

Super unhappy with the wait times.... ordering, drink refills,  getting the check. 

Very unhappy with the fact that i went to eat there with my two girls on a thursday night, my wife ordered an entree, my kids two kids meals, and  i ordered a dozen wings, basket of fries, and a drink. (came out to like 13 or 14 dollars.) And the waitress only gave us one kids meal free.

Asked her about it and she said its only valid per adult entree. I dont get it, so if i would have ordered an 8 dollar hamburger and a water, i could have got the second kids meal free. 

First of all. You see we have two kids on a thursday night, if my meal isnt going to count as an entree. FLIPPIN TELL ME!!!!  UGGGHHHH, 

I guess ill just have to go back to Native New Yorker."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time to watch Thursday night football and have a meal. Dirty tables, disorganized and undertrained staff, and only a few tvs had the game on. 

Of course no one could hear the game because we had to have 70s rock on instead. 

The food was disappointing. Service was clunky. 

Had to ask for waitress to close the door to the smoking patio because a fog of smoke was flowing in.

Once, and done"}
{"text":"Ordered wings, extra crispy,  received wings burnt. Waitress very apologetic . Manager not so much. Wings smelled and looked burnt. Will not be coming back. Yikes! Service is extremely slow. Manager Nicole  is horrible at customer service. If looking for good edible wings, stay far away. Lol"}
{"text":"Pretty good experience here... Heather W. Was the first to greet me, she was extremely informative. Heather the bartender was very nice as well. Everyone was pleasantly nice to me. This was my first visit and I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went to sidelines and had a wonderful experience! The bartender Megan was so attentive to our needs.... just a breathe of fresh air. Food was outstanding, beer was ice cold. We will definitely be back.the place is a 10!! Don't miss out on this neighborhood gem. Say hello to Megan, she is fantastic."}
{"text":"Came here twice in 2 days! Tried it for lunch. $7 lunch special was a side salad and 6 wings. Good value for what you pay. Not sure why bone in wings are a $1 up charge seems like boneless wings would warrant the up charge. Whatever I did not wish to quarrel over $1 just seems petty. Moving on. The blue cheese dressing was really good not watered down but with actual blue cheese chunks! The wing temp for hot as in spicy was great. They offer a grilled wing option and I tried that the second time I was there and I preferred the grilled wing option.

For the NBA draft picks I chose this place for its familiarity and tried the fish and chips ! Great pick. Sweet delicious cole slaw and curly fries were also served up. Tried the fried pickles and they were just ok I wouldn't get them again because the breading slid off them too easily. Prefer the pickle chips fried up! Oh well! Alejandra G. was awesome as our server and had a great smile and attitude. Some other server came in and man you could tell she did not want to be there. Like her pet turtle got run over by a Harley or something. Salty is what I'll call her. 

Day before work sat at the bar and Megan was tending the bar. There are regulars that get all the convo and attention. She was friendly but didn't seem genuine like a Miss America is when they ask her an important question and she knows the camera is on. I like real not fake. And wolf tells it like it is. 

Anyways nice hang out place with nice jumbo  TVs. Love the shape of the bar. Good bar food! Stop in and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is TERRIFIC!  I have been several times with my family and they've got something for EVERYONE!!  Their salads are yummy as well as all of their appetizers and sandwiches/burgers.  Their wings are hands-down the biggest and best in the East Valley!  Our favorite are the Sweet Chili wings.  Sweet & Spicy all at once!
The outdoor patio with its comfortable seating and fireplace is such a great addition, along with the live music.
And if you wanna watch a game, this is definitely the place to be!  TVs everywhere!  And if you're lucky enough to sneak into one of their booths, you get your OWN TV!
The wait staff is always friendly and attentive, and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"I love this bar! The bar is big, has sports playing. The bartenders are really nice and attentive. I have eaten here several times. The wings are great. I love the shrimp tacos. The burgers are good too. It's bar food, but it's done really well. And I have met some really nice patrons there too."}
{"text":"To start, this is my first Yelp review! So here it goes! 
This is one of the best \"Dive Bars\" I've experienced. Great Bartenders, very friendly and attentive! Good beer selection, they have Blue Moon & Kilt Lifter so I approve :). Regular drink prices are not that bad!!  They have HUGE portions of food that I ate way too much of....and also for a really decent price. We started with a 1/2 dozen sweet chili wings. Holy. Moly. Huge wings, and beyond delicious! Next: the burgers. Another Holy. Moly. moment. They had to be at least a 1/2 pounder! I ordered the California Dreamin' Burger with Swiss, Bacon, and Avocado: YUMM!! You can also get this with chicken instead of as a burger, but I just had to splurge! What made this burger even more worth purchasing is that I have the other half of it saved for another lunch or dinner :) The atmosphere is great. Lots and lots of TV's for those sports fans, but they also play non-sports shows too for people like me to be entertained by :) They even have individual TV's at each booth! It is a very clean and fun place to hangout with friends. 
5 stars in my book. Everything about this place was enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times with some friends but just for booze and to watch NFL on Sundays since they have the NFL Ticket.  Last night the wife and I stopped because Blu Burger had no place to sit :(  .  Although this is no Blu Burger, the burgers are pretty good and so are the wings.  Staff was nice and food wasn't the fastest, but the place was pretty packed.  They usually have good beer at a good price.  And...the Cuban sandwich was suprisingly good."}
{"text":"Sidelines you are amazing especially on a Tues night  when you have the wings special. Cheap drinks relaxing atmosphere. Best wings ever! Try them grilled ....delicious!!!! Some of the best flavors are sweet chili and teriyaki!!!!mmmm a hidden gem and perfect with some PBR"}
{"text":"Being the first time into this establishment I found it to be a pretty neat little sports bar. The food there was good service was excellent prices were competitive with local establishments in and around the area. The Bar is reminiscent of your local neighborhood watering hole. The furniture and tables are what you would expect of a typical local hang out.  On the menu they had various bar specialties and the happy hour was pretty good with two dollars off selected appetizers. The number of appetizers was expansive so it was a good choice for anyone who is looking for something just light to eat.  I would go there again since it was casual, laid back and didn't require putting on any airs. Just local folks enjoying a beer."}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix area to get away from the brutal Chicago winter. To my dismay this joint did not have the NHL package on Direct TV. Really? There are only like a ton of snowbirds down here from the northern U.S. and Canada. We split and are bound for BWW. Who knows about the food?"}
{"text":"Been coming here since the opening.  My friends refuse to go due to all the bad experiences, but my wife and I usually enjoy it.  Issues with coupons they put in the paper each week,  but refuse to honor tonight.  Although we are regulars, we are never acknowledged due to the fact they seem to have different servers each week.  We spend over $1000 a year there, but tonight we are done.  Too many other places in the area that are now open."}
{"text":"Let me say this..... wings were awesome! We went to this place based on reviews that they have the best wings in Chandler and they weren't kidding! Three of our party ordered 4 different types of wings - honey garlic, salt n pepper rub, Thai chili and buffalo (medium). They said all four were amazing. Plus they let you order (for a tiny bit more) all flats or all rounds. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich that had tons of fresh avocado (most places skimp on the avocado likes it's being rationed), Bacon, and Swiss cheese. The bun was perfectly toasted and it came with a side of either fries, curly fries, tots, etc. I order d the tots and they were really good, too. 

Draft beer was $3.75 (Miller lite) for 24oz. Which is a great price (non-happy hour.)

We will definitely be back!

Service was great! The server said she was fairly new but she did a great job!"}
{"text":"I placed an order for pick up. Was told \"it'll be ready in 15 mins\". Got there 20 mins later,  paid and waited 15 more minutes.  No apologies, sorry for the delay, etc. I DON'T suggest ordering to go."}
{"text":"sat here for over 10 minutes to even get acknowledged from anyone. Finally 10 more minutes to get our drinks (water and one beer) and 20 more minutes for our food to get to the table. This is completely unacceptable. maybe 8 tables full in this tiny restaurant. This is really sad! Surprised they still stay open. Very slow service. Not the first time here but might be our last."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a bit of a dive, but it's close to home, so I get to call it my dive.  All of the food I've had has been great.  They have a ton of TVs, a great craft selection with rotating taps, and good specials most every night.  I often come here to watch a game with my wife and young daughter. They're kid friendly and even have TVs in the booths that we sometimes turn to cartoons to keep her entertained.  The only thing that is a little annoying can be the service. It's nothing against the servers or bartenders (who are generally very kind), we just notice that often they're under-staffed, having two ladies sometimes cover a half-full restaurant. However, it never stops us from coming back for more."}
{"text":"Went to watch the ASU game, place was packed. Always have the wings and fish tacos. Good service for as busy as it was. Decent prices on beverages and a great sports atmosphere inside or out on the patio. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Get the grilled wings. Some of the best I've had around Chandler. I'd give 5 stars but for a breakfast menu that doesn't end til 11. I wanted wings at 10. Otherwise, great place. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Low-end \"sports bar\".

I did not see anything that would attract me there. It has been around for a long time so some people must like it. When I was there it was mostly guys getting off work wanting a beer... nothing fancy, not horrible, but not a place I'd stop at again."}
{"text":"I've lived in Chandler for nearly 11 years and have never been before and I regret not trying sooner.  We were with a large group and I was pleasantly surprised with the excellent service and food. Our waitress was really attentive and efficient considering how many people we had.  The owner Kristina is very friendly and personally comes over to introduce herself.  The food was good, typical sports bar type food.  Hamburgers, wings, etc.  They also had salads which looked pretty good but I choose the Sun Devil burger which was delicious.

I also love the coziness of the restaurant.  I think its the perfect place to meet friends for dinner or family night out.  They have personal TV's in each booth to keep the kiddos occupied which is a huge plus.  There are also many other TV's throughout the restaurant so you can watch all your favorite sports.  Will defiantly be back.  Great experience!!"}
{"text":"This is a spot I have hoped was good because it is locally owned and has a friendly staff but food is straight up bad. Giving 2 stars because the staff is so friendly. Hope they can turn it around"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! We used to live right down the street, so we would go about 3 times a week. They have some of the best wings in Chandler!!

Also, the prices on the regular menu are fantastic and the happy hour is even better. The staff is so so so friendly and personal, most of the waitresses knew our drink order as soon as we walked in the door.

The booths are great as well. Each booth has its own television in it. I definitely recommend Sidelines to anyone looking for a very relaxed sports bar."}
{"text":"Stopped here for happy hour, dinner and to catch the NBA playoffs. 

I had the beer battered fried pickles and tator tots while my friend had the wings and regular fries. Pickles were good but a little too salty and the tots were kinda oily. Regular fries were really tasty but then I tasted remnants of bacon in them and as a vegan I was grossed out lol my friend really liked the wings and said they were flavorful. They also have a huge selection of craft and draft beer and drinks. I had a regular margarita and it had way too much tequila in it. I ended up giving it to my friend. 

Service was really great! Our server was nice, attentive and accommodating. A true sports bar, they have a ton of TVs everywhere (even in the individual booths!) so you can catch any and every game. 

Overall really liked this place! Will definitely come back when in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"The hubby and I have been meaning to try this place out for a while now. We decided to go in for a quick lunch to check it out. 

 Yes, the atmosphere isn't that much to write home about. We sat on the patio since it was a lovely fall afternoon. We had no issues with the wait staff as others have stated in the reviews. We were worried about being forgotten about since we were the only ones on the patio but we still got pretty good service. 

My husband ordered the Philly cheese steak and I got the Cobb salad wrap. We were both not disappointed in our food at all. For bar food it was very good. We will for sure be venturing back for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here about three times and did not like it. We were a group of five and it took them forever to pay attention to us.  The waitress didn't really seem to care.  Some customers were rude too as a couple of them made a nasty remark as we were leaving. This happened in '08 haven't been back since, I'm still very angered by this incident."}
{"text":"Zero stars would be more appropriate. Came in for burger and wings, was one of two tables of customers. Food was terrible, took 45 minutes to get out, the people that ordered after us were served 15 minutes before us. When I paid the check the waitress ran around for 40 minutes with my credit card. Every time i pass this place i wonder how the doors stay open."}
{"text":"I usually love this place,  but tonight my mother had a salad that a fly crawled out of,  they took it back (yay) she got the chili,  was barely luke warm and was honestly tomato soup with beans. Also it's  Team Trivia girl is an idiot,  she can't READ! Seriously, she couldn't even pronounce sergeant! This was a nightmare!  My parents usually love this place ands I like it when I've been here, tonight was a catastrophe!"}
{"text":"Pathetic operations and management in place. Social group had an event here and management was notified at least a day in advance. Only two or three employees on the floor for this situation. Why doesn't anyone know how to run a restaurant anymore?"}
{"text":"Their hot wings are so good, and we love the price on Tuesday. We are here every Tuesday for the wing special. The atmosphere is very welcoming. The wait staff is very friendly. I would recommend trying Sidelines, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great Friday Night Fish & Chips. Five big pieces!!!  Very nice Sports Bar in Chandler 85248."}
{"text":"Was here late at night for a beer it was a little slow but the bartender was nice. She told me that the wings are good and it's a good place to meet locals. I had heard this before for a customer of mine so I tend to believe her, have to find out in the coming months"}
{"text":"Poor food service . Took a half hour for a dozen wings . I would understand if they were busy . But it was slow . But they sure were sending out drinks quick though ."}
{"text":"We tried to give this place another try and I will tell you our server was named Nicole she was completely rude did not use proper grammar while speaking was completely jumping to the defense every time our food would come out wrong which with each time we ordered and had to send back the same item three times. Then when it was time to pay she argue back and forth because it was happy hour prices and supposedly they do not honor gift certificates during happy hour prices even though gift certificates equal currency. I witnessed a bartender picking her nose and not washing her hands after she use the bathroom. Nicole went on and on Ad nauseam arguing and becoming very defensive because the food was burned and charged a dollar more for grilling the wings when apparently they are fried. Horrible horrible will never go back do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food and great happy hour prices ! We were a family of 5 looking for some pub grub and boy did we find it . We ordered the sampler platter - really wasn't worth it for the price $10.99 . We ordered a dozen boneless wings $7.99 and chicken strip baskets $7.99 both we're phenomenal! If I had to choose between Buffalo Wild Wings or sidelines for wings I would take sidelines any day ! The trick is to go during happy hour to grab the $7.99 specials . As far as wing flavors go you can get hot , mild or bbq . For the fries you can have regular, curly or tater tots . The kids all had the curly fries and loved them. We will
Definitely be throwing sidelines into our rotation ."}
{"text":"Yet again another place I go to for beverages, usually after work and a long rough day. Super friendly staff, they always have the games on I want to watch. 
Probably my favorite sports bar around my house... I havent eaten anything here, but next time I'm gonna give the wings a whirl."}
{"text":"They advertise grilled wings but everything is fried.  Nowhere on the menu does it say the grilled wings are actually fried, not grilled, and they charge extra even though they cook them the same."}
{"text":"This is the best sports bar I have ever been too!! They have the best wings I have ever had! Flavor is amazing and great service for a reasonable price! The boneless- medium are the best wings I have ever had by far!"}
{"text":"Food was alright. Typical sports bar food. Beer selection on tap is a little weak. But what the atmosphere here is great. I think part of that reason was the bartender Megan. Delightful young lady who was friendly, always smiling and knew half the people there. I'll be back for sure to try some more food. Had the chicken and bacon Saturday special. Was ok. I'd order it again."}
{"text":"The grilled hot wings are awesome and the beer is cold. Lots of TVs for the games and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Average at best.  Nothing special.  Decent place to have a few beers and watch a game.   Food is a little subpar. Wings are ok but had buffalo wings but seemed a little under done so didn't bother eating them."}
{"text":"This review is purely about the wings-
I've been meaning to come back here since my last review about two years ago. I was there this evening with a couple friends and I have to say their wings are so good! The best wings in town! 
My hubs and I had today the honey garlic and salt & pepper rub. Both were grilled. They were both good and actually a good combination to have together. The honey garlic was a little sweet and had a very small kick to it. The salt and pepper was a little extra than basic wings and was a bit more dry and crispy.
I suddenly feel hungry again thinking about it!
I will be back soon and I'm bringing people with me!"}
{"text":"We had a mediocre experience our first time at Sidelines. The next time we went the service was incredible (I could not manage to empty my water even though I went through like 5 glasses). My burger was incredible. The curly fries were very good. We ordered jalapeno caps (per the server's recommendation) as an appetizer which I highly recommend and am now craving. The sandwich was very very good. We did not like the wings either time we went. Some people love 'em, they just didn't have a great flavor and they were not crispy. 

A fun touch for kids is that the booth tables have tvs at them that you can self-tune so that they can have their cartoons (or you can have your game)."}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood treasure. It's the local bar everyone loves to go to. They have everything and a friendly staff to boot. Great atmosphere and brining kids is a joy. 
We ordered a shot of Fireball, Bud Light, cheese sticks, their classic wings, the Meatloaf, Chef Salad, Grill Cheese for the boys. Really high quality food and at $69 for the entire dinner tab for the family , very impressed. Especially considering my wife & I each had our share of premium drinks. Not sure why we don't go more. One of those things that it's so close you never go. We'll keep trying!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood bar and grill has a very comfortable atmosphere. They serve a wide variety of food also. Wings are unmatched in the east valley. May I suggest wings prepared hot flavor on the grill. Wings and a cold beer can't be beat. The daytime bartender, Megan, is fun, with an effervescent personality."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the drinks, and the bartenders rock! Especially my beautiful Megan on Thursdays!! ;)"}
{"text":"I legit think Sidelines has some of the best wings in the east valley. Really great texture and not oversauced. I think ATL Wings are the best on this side of town, but Sidelines are definitely second choice for me. The grilled option  is really good. Otherwise, your typical sports bar. Plenty of TVs, with separate ones in the booths which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"After softball on Tuesday nights our team likes to visit Sidelines. Cheap drinks, decent bar food, friendly service and plenty of TV's to watch your favorite team, it is a good place to get together and hang out."}
{"text":"Nice space, decorated well. Good view of all tvs and the food was decent. I had the Friday fish fry and my wife had the \"all new\" pork tenderloin sandwich. The fish was good but my wifes sandwich was dry. Our food sat on the counter ready to be served for more than 10 minutes. The service was not good. Our server paid little attention to us."}
{"text":"We were at another sports bar when the service was not up to par so we left during the end of the first quarter of a football game and cam across Sidelines. We found a great spot by a TV, great food menu and they had my drink!! Which is a plus! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pathetic !!!  dirty, poor management, terrible food..... needs to close .. dont waste your time or money......"}
{"text":"Love this little sports bar, but tonight I was not thrilled with the fish fry.  For $10 you get 5 pcs. of fish, french fries, and cole slaw.  Who needs 5 pcs of fish (especially since it is awful fish)?  Too much breading that does not have any flavor, plus it was overcooked.  I would love a nice slice of marble rye instead of all that fish!"}
{"text":"YES please,,, lol, this place has been better than other local places since the staff here treat you the same as the regulars.. Kudos.. 

Good wings also, n just the right beers on TAP.. Love being treated equally, and hate other places that visibly take care of their regulars over the other patrons..  

Great Job,,"}
{"text":"Love Sidelines! Great service as always from Nicole and Paige today. Food was excellent. Best sports bar in Chandler"}
{"text":"Came here since Zipps had the first wait I ever experienced. I ordered boneless wings. Drinks and food took a bit. For a Friday night, the place was partially filled so it's not like they were slammed. Drinks were a bit slow. Server may have had too much on her plate (Nicole was her name). She was nice though, at least! 

Still prefer our regular Zipps but I do like their boneless wings! May be influenced by my broken wrist limitations and painkillers. Lol."}
{"text":"They were playing country music which was great and it wasn't too loud so you could actually talk.  Menu looked good.  Draft industrial beer was way too expensive for a locals bar.  They were clearly over-serving some very drunk regulars, so bet on that biting them in the near future."}
{"text":"I loved my experience here. I had great service and there are exceptional dishes here! I met one woman, she was such a friendly employee. Her name was Tiyler because of her i will be returning. My group and i had a great time here!"}
{"text":"The wings are usually really good, but they were way over cooked and tough this week. My chicken sandwich had a strange \"refrigerator taste\" and my husband was dissatisfied w the tough beef in his meal. We told the waitress our food was not as good as it usually was, and asked if it was reheated.  She said, \"I'm not sure. Are you ready for your bill?\" We paid for our gross food and left. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went to sidelines this evening and sat down at a booth in the back.  Waited 15 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders and no one came to our booth. So, we left and took our business elsewhere. I'd like to say it was very busy, but there were several open tables.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Service was a great, super friendly. I ordered a chicken sandwich, didn't have too much flavor but wasn't terrible. The zucchini's and skins were typical bar foods. Overall for drinks, the place to go and watch some sports."}
{"text":"Second time here and it's even the better. The wings are amazing and they have SECN!! The staff is all very accommodating and pleasant. It's wasn't crowded but just enough people. Great neighborhood bar!"}
