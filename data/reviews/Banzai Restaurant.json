{"text":"Went to the Banzai as it was showcased on one of the Dealfinds for a great price to try out a new restaurant, so I bought one.  The first time I went, it was a cold Saturday afternoon around 4PM ish and we ordered $30 worth of food and the Bento Box which I love the presentation and variety was okay.  The tempura was horrid as it was either refried or fried with oil that wasn't hot enough as it was greasy and lackluster.  The sushi wasn't anything to write home about but it filled the hunger and I am always willing to give them a second chance.  Our second time was a Monday night enroute to a night of errands and running around.  It's a great way to drop in for a quick bite as you order and grab a table and then your number is called and you pick up your food, so a more casual and relaxed not so fast food way of dining out.  The decor is nice and contemporary and the staff are friendly and warm and they came and checked at our table to ask how we are enjoying our food.  So, that is a really nice touch at a fast food type style venue.  The second time, the food was AMAZING and soooooooo good.  The sauces on the beef and chicken on the Mega Bowls was fantastic!  I ordered the smoked salmon and crab sushi this time and it was way better with piping crispy pork spring rolls which were not greasy as they must have found the temperature knob this time.  I will be going back often for great food that is no fuss and out the door if I am on a time constraint as they do take out as well.  They close at 7- 8PM, check their hours, as I made the mistake of going one night when they were closing after parking a half block away in the minus temperatures.

I am Craving it as we speak.....  YUM YUM!"}
{"text":"Calling all Japanese Village Fans!  If you want to go and get your crave-on you can get their steak sauce at Banzai!

They have a rice bowl with beef that you can get the sauce with yum!

They have a good selection of sushi rolls that are not that expensive.  Their bento boxes are super fun.  You can choose what you want in yours from sushi pieces to rice and meat.  They all come with a salad and soup!  The place gets a little crazy at lunch time during the week, but the cooks are quick and try to get everyone out the door and served fast!

They also have large sushi/tempura platters that you can order for your sushi party! sweet!

Its nice to have a place you can sit down and have a beer and some sushi during lunch (if you can get a table!) or you can take your food back to your office and relax.

This place is a def favorite for my friends and I, you wont be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel nearby and saw this place.  Very unassuming from the outside but surprisingly lovely inside.  Order at the counter and then when you get your order go find a seat. I went there at lunchtime just before the noon rush.  Ordered the beef and chicken bento box.  Plenty of nicely cooked and spiced beef as well as chicken.  You also get miso, salad, rice and vegetable spring rolls.  Very good value for $10.50. Free iced cold water as well.  Next time I'm in town, I'd definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Quality Japanese restaurant, minus the expensive menu.

I discovered Banzai by accident. We were at Southport Road by Macleod when we decided to look around for a place to grab lunch and we found it. There is a wide selection on the menu, from Donburi/rice bowls ( about $7) to sushi (ranging from $3-$12) to Udon/noodles ($8) and bento boxes ($9). The bento box combos are awesome. You can choose from a mix and match menu of cali rolls, tempura, beef teriyaki and chicken teriyaki and they all come free with salad, really nice and crunchy spring rolls, and of course, miso soup. All of which are very tasty and well-prepared. I always order the combo, as it easily satisfies my healthy and discerning appetite. They also have Japanese beer and sake on their drinks menu, aside from your regular soda, beer and juice.

Till staff's friendly. Banzai has two locations in Calgary, one in Macleod and one Downtown-4th Avenue SW. I frequent the DT branch and there you have a cozier and well-designed place as compared to the casual, fastfood atmosphere of the Macleod branch. 
Parking is available for both branches, though the DT place has only about 3 provisions."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my fave sushi places downtown! Decently priced, food is amazing and it's walking distance from the office!

You have to come around 11:30, it's set up cafeteria style so the tables fill up really quick.

I usually get the teriyaki chicken and tempura bento box and order some sushi on the side, you're pleasantly full for just under $15 (a rarity for places downtown!)

Plus they have a frequent customer card, so after 7 stamps you get a free meal!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place. The food you get for the price is quite filling, especially if you have the rice bowls. Very tasty food.

The area to eat in isn't overly huge, but it's decently spaced. Our food was ready quite quickly. I'd ordered the Sesame Beef bowl, and couldn't finish it. So filling, and so very good.

Definitely recommended, and it's somewhere I suspect I'll be returning to"}
{"text":"I first started coming here about 4 years ago, and now I try to hit it up at least once a month.  The counter staff is always friendly, and there is a nice amount of seating available.  If you are a fan of weird art, you can enjoy the 6 foot mural of some sushi rolls made out of torn magazines.  If this isn't your cup of tea (shame on you), you can get your food to go as well.  There is enough variety on the menu that even a picky eater like myself can have multiple favourites.

Banzai does rice bowls (I can't get enough of the Chicken Teryiaki), soups, Bento boxes (a combo where you choose two mains to go with your rice, salad, and spring rolls), and tons of assorted sushi (I especially like the veggie rolls, and they even do Alberta rolls here).  Everything is reasonably priced as well - the rice bowls range from $6.50 to $7.50,  and the Bento boxes are around $9.  More importantly, they have forks available for those of us who clumsily skewer our food when forced to use chopsticks.

They make all the food fresh, yet I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my order, and that was during the dinner rush.  Give this place a try - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm Asian...I wike my wice so when it's lunch time and I need my fix I will head over to Banzai. It's about a block away from my work which is perfect! A great alternative to going to your nearest grease based fast food joint.

I recommend going to Banzai at around 11:30-11:45AM which is the time where generally the restaurant is still fairly unoccupied. Hit up Banzai at 12:00PM and you might not find a seat to sit at to eat your delicious food.

The girls behind the cashier tills are fobby, cute and super nice - always greeting you with big smiles and prepping each tray and serving each dish as quickly as possible to get keep the flow going.

I usually only will get the Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl. The portion is perfect for me by the time I am done the bowl I am fairly full, got the itis, sometimes want to sleep after lol. The bowl is $6.25 which I think is totally fair for what you get. Again, better than spending the extra $2-3.00 for fast food that is deep fried.

Try it out!"}
{"text":"The sauce rice and salad is AAA. Japanese village sauces. Sushi is pretty good too. SAUCE!!!! I've been addicted since I was a small boy.  Im sorry but the meat w the rice bowls is not good. quit precooking your meat like edo. nobody likes pre-cooked beef - and if they do they dont know any better. COOK IT FRESH TO ORDER!!! still ginger sauce and sesame are beyond killer. i pick up steaks at safeway and rice sauce and salad from Banzai. Killer taste."}
{"text":"You are looking for FRIENDLY, FAST, INEXPENSIVE, and CLEAN?
You found the right place!
Like most places down-town, expect a crowd at lunchtime!"}
{"text":"Although I don't live near Banzai anymore, so I only tend to visit a few times a year, I love the food & if I'm in the area around meal time I'll make sure to carve out some time to visit.

I usually do take-out (it's been years since I dined in). They have a large seating area for those waiting for food, as well as tables for those staying to eat. I usually get the spicy chicken rice bowl - highly recommended. Got a good kick to it but not too spicy.

The staff is always friendly & the price is comparable to other locations in Calgary. 

Highly recommend a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here quite often few years ago, and I happened to visit here again. I remember foods here were OK but this time I was a bit disappointed. I had chicken rice bawl which was too salty. I suffered to complete it. my wife ordered lunch box. Tempura were a bit wired that shell is too crunchy and sauce was just like noodle soup? There was no customer other than us and all employees are doing nothing, bunch of dirty plates were stacked left on cupboard. I might try again just because reasonable price"}
{"text":"Banzai became a popular location for myself and my work colleagues when I worked downtown.  Conveniently situated only blocks from our office, we all pilled into this place on a few occasions.  My fiance & I also enjoyed a few lunch dates here.

Asian restaurants like this are a dime a dozen in Calgary.  Almost every mall, shopping centre, strip mall, or block has one.  But comparing Banzai to any other places in Calgary isn't fair or accurate.  Banzai is different for a few reasons.

First of all, the quality of food here is really good.  We never had any issues with our order, nobody got sick, and the food always tasted great.  Very important in my books, because I've had some pretty bad experiences with Asian restaurants.  It's a bit more expensive than you'll find elsewhere, but is to be expected when you factor in their location and the size of the establishment.

The service is good as well, but not fantastic.  Fairly typical of restaurants that serve this type of cuisine.  The decor here is really nice though.  It's very stylish and sexy (yeah, I have a rule about using sexy to describe anything that isn't a lady, but oh well).  It's a pleasure to sit here and enjoy a meal and it's always kept clean.  Two very important items for any location.  So the next time you're looking for lunch, stop in to Banzai, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Banzai wa, kakkoi desu. 

Like Thomas, I've been going to Banzai for at least four years. Clean environment, friendly service and prompt!

And the food? Oishi desu! I've tried nearly all of the bento box combinations and about half of the rice bowls listed on the menu. Every experience is delicious. 

If you get a Banzai card, every sixth meal is free. Yes, you can get a bento box with that free meal

My family and friends are now also hooked on the food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Calgary (albeit fast food sushi). I love the bento boxes and have them almost every time."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a takeout place.  If  you can't make the time to sit down for Sushi, this is a nice backup."}
{"text":"If you want cheap, you want fast and you don't want typical cheap and fast food, Banzai is a good place to pop in. I met a friend here for lunch earlier this week and treated myself to a Teriyaki Chicken rice bowl for $6.25. 

The bowl size was plentiful enough, there was a lot of rice, some sprouts and a good portion of chicken on top. I wasn't overly pleased with the chicken, nor was I expecting super quality cuts for the price I was paying. We also got an order of dumplings, those were alright, and I did enjoy the sauce they came with.

Maybe I just need to try ordering something else next time, the chicken just wasn't doing it for me. But the restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly. It's some pretty good digs considering it's housed in a bit of a rougher 1/2 block of downtown."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, but awful sushi. Rice tastes fatty, I've never had this experience before.. I got spicy tuna and banzai roll, both were horrid with too much rice."}
{"text":"Service was painfully slow. When we finally received our food the was very little filling in our maki and waaaay too much rice. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi option in the area!!... All sushi rolls are great, including the Calgary roll with beef... Also the spicy chicken or the spicy beef with rice are very good too. As it is the best around, normally is     Very busy at lunch.. I think this is my favorite sushi restaurant in the area!!.."}
{"text":"Stopped by Banzai on the way home.  Ordered the Beef and Tempura Bento Box - sizable box with a green salad, rice, tempura, beef and sesame sauce, and  miso soup.  Also ordered endamame, banzai roll, alberta roll (beef w sesame sauce) and spicy salmon roll and a plate of salmon sashimi.  Everything tastes good.  

The only pet peeve I have is the salmon sashimi.  What was presented to us was a little plate of paper thin salmon sashimi!  Not that great at all!  Disappointed in the thinness of the sashimi.  I like mine thick!!  

Note:  You know that wonderful steak sauce you get at Japanese Village Steak House, you can also purchase the same steak sauce here at Banzai!  Great for stirfrys at home.

Free parking available in the front of the restaurant.  Tight parking lot.

Food is good for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"It is a small location, and often busy, but for cheap rice and meat bowls it is hard to beat.   

I LOVE their Bento Boxes, as you can get tempura or sushi along with chicken or beef with rice AND soup and salad.   I've often asked for double salad instead of soup and its no problem. 

The thing that makes Bonzai so addictive is their Sesame Sauce - same as Japanese Village's.     We sometimes order a bottle of it to add to our steaks at home, and man is it tasty.   

One frustrating thing is when we DO order a bottle of sauce we have to wait in their queue system, so you might wait 10+ minutes for a bottle of sauce until it is your turn for them to fill the order.  Would be quicker to just have a bunch pre-made that day in the bottles to give to customers a la carte."}
