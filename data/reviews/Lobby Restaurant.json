{"text":"Oh snobby Lobby, are you good at anything at all? 

Secretly, I like it the way I like US Magazine and the odd Long Island Iced Tea. This is hands down my definition of slummin' it Yorkville stye. 

The mute bartenders are slightly Amazonian in that they are tall, overly tanned and they have cheap boob jobs. Drinks are way expensive considering the staff doesn't even entertain with speech.

The rotating cheeseball DJs run the gamut from faux-Monaco yacht selection to the roughest mixed mashups ever. The soundsytem is one of the worst in the city and they cram way too many people into the narrow, corridor-like space. I gave it 6 months when it first opened (that was years ago).

BUT, it's such a guilty pleasure! I usually arrive as casual as possible and chat up the girls with lies about almost everything: my name, job, marital status. I a completely meaningless and invisible to the patrons.

The clientele like their nightlife exactly like what it looks like: a bottomless pit of total vacuity. And sometimes, that's all you want."}
{"text":"Yes... I experienced much better. lets start with the entrance... so i walk in, and there is this guy at the entrance asking me if i am on the guest list... 'come on buddy' i have been through this show before.. why does he even bother asking me... nope. i am not on the guest list... and guess what... in 2 seconds he will welcome me in... so why even bother with making this 'show'. [I am sorry, I just cant get it... guest lists, and stuff, who do they think they are, open the gate, let me go in... now! :)]

anyway, 2 seconds and i am, I am going downstairs for an expensive coast check.. at least the lady there behind the counter was extremely nice.. on her Tip jar she she says she want to go to Paris... so i left enough tip to help her... and i also got a big big smile...

from there ... it is just going downwards...  the service is bad... not all the barwomen know how to make the rights drinks and how to shake them...  nothing was real... most of the things there were fake. 

this place has a huge potential... but they just dont leverage it...

i will surely visit again and will keep you updated"}
{"text":"Lobby is a good bar for a night out but a GREAT PLACE for a private function!

I was there tonight for my good friend's bridal shower dinner and it was an absolutely wonderful night! 

Apart from the originality of this bridal shower being a sit down dinner at an upscale place, there were so many good things about this dinner at Lobby.

First off, Lobby set up the backroom really beautifully, with a U-shaped table so people could still see each other and talk to their heart's content.

Second, the food was AMAZING! I started out my meal with a fresh mixed green salad with a honey vinagrette dressing, followed by an order of ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach and dressed with a fresh tomato sauce.

Then for dessert, I had melt in your mouth Vanille Creme Brule.

If I did not have my specific meal, I would have had another choice of soup for my starter, a chicken or salmon option for my main and either a chocolate lava cake or a fresh berries and ice cream combo if I was not in a creme brule mood.

Overall, I would recommend this place for a special private function! :)


As a bar, I have enjoyed Lobby in the past for drinks with friends, but if you are having a night out there, definitely bring an empty credit card or a pile of cash with you. 

The drinks are expensive but as they say, you pay for an upscale atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I stepped into the The Lobby to get out of a rain storm in the early afternoon and the place was empty except for on table of two.  I did not try the food

The beers and wine are priced higher than your typical bar.  This is apparently by design as they are attempting to attract a trendy and upscale clientele.  The staff was very friendly, talkative, and invited me back for their late night event.  

Upon returning later that night, there was a guardian at the door only letting the desired crowd in.  After entering, the place was packed and full of attractive and friendly people.  A DJ was spinning tunes, proffesional dancers danced on the bar, and Miss Canada 2009 was celebrating her birthday.  The staff was full of attractive bartenders and waitresses.

Overall, The Lobby met or exceeded the expectations for that type of bar.  The exclusivity and higher priced drinks are part of this.  

My only complaint is that they would not except credit cards at the end of the night and I had to pay cash.  No major issue.  I will return... if I can get back in."}
