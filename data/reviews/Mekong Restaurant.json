{"text":"Amazing! The atmosphere is quaint, everyone is so friendly, and the food is incredible (and affordable). I've tried several things on their menu and they're always delicious -- though I'm partial to the spring rolls.  They also do delivery, which is pretty quick.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Get the pho or the Vietnamese noodles! Place is run by nice people and the atmosphere is what you want from a little whole in the wall place like this."}
{"text":"It's pretty good owner was very attentive. . Went with a friend as her 21 yr old dtr recommended it.  I love Vietnamese food but my friend is new to it.  I think my favorite spots are still the restaurant inside the ne t and t pacific court off 36 st ne. . And 12th and Macleod upstairs. My favorite dish is chicken vermicelli with extra spring rolls basil and bean sprouts and their fish sauce minus the little red chili flakes as i like things mild! Yum now I'm hungry and craving this again!"}
{"text":"Good portions for the price. Ordered chicken lo mein and pork chow mein. Not bursting with flavor but good nonetheless. Very little noodles in chow mein but overall a good dish. Will definitely be ordering from them again at this price point."}
{"text":"I've given the place a few tries, and each time I've been sadly disappointed. The food was consistently flavorless. Not really much else to say."}
{"text":"Definitely a solid 4. Everything was tasty and good quality. They make everything to order, and the food was delicious. I should have taken food home, but I cleaned my plate. Try one of their Vietnamese noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu that my family has tried has been delicious!! The staff is terrific and always friendly. Their pho is the best in town and the Vietnamese noodles are fantastic!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Pitt.  Hands down.   The cashew chicken and spicy noodles with shrimp are excellent."}
{"text":"The food was good. I ordered the general tso's chicken and an order of cheese wontons. It is a small dinning area if you wish to eat in. The flavor was good and you got big pieces of chicken. A little bit more expensive than others but overall good."}
{"text":"Staff at this place are nice and friendly I don't mind going there at least once a week. The prices are reasonable and the waitress remembers people and makes you feel at home. The food is also pretty good!"}
{"text":"Some stuff is good. Others, less so. Finally thought I'd try the Mekong Noodles. Ordered pork--got shrimp. Hey, that's fine. But watch out, this dish has no sauce on it at all. It's just some dry rice noodles, a bit of saut√©ed veggies, and like 5 or 6 shrimp. Must say I expected more from a Chef's special.   Cheese wontons are pretty good. I always want to try new stuff beyond general's or lo mein, but every time I do I think, \"why did I do this?\"  Will go back. Mediocre, but not wretched."}
{"text":"P.I.F. (partner in fooding) and I were walking down Potomac on our way to Thai Spoon (love!) and sad to find it closed for the day. Oh well, why not try Mekong then? So we headed back up the street to Mekong. We assumed it would be the expected americanized chinese food like everything else in the south hills..meh, but were pleasantly surprised to find a smattering of vietnamese dishes on the menu. We were greeted with friendly service, complimentary tea and ordered the Pho with high hopes. We were not disappointed. The pho was outstanding. I'm honestly surprised to see the negative reviews. PIF and I are no strangers to Pho and agree mekong might have the best in the south hills. While I can't speak to the quality of the more mainstream chinese on their menu, I was impressed and will be back for more pho very soon!"}
{"text":"New management :( not the same at all :( very sad and the unique duck sauce is no more, back to regular plastic packets. Prices too expensive for it not to be prior amazing food. Probably won't be dining here now :("}
{"text":"If you look up unassuming in the dictionary you might find a photo of Mekong. Like many Vietnamese restaurants the interior is austere and utilitarian, but it's clean and homey. The first time I had lunch there I wasn't expecting much, I kind of had \"the usual\" the vermicelli with spring rolls and bbq pork. To my surprise it was really, really good and really, really fresh.   The appetizer was what really floored me though, the spicy beef on lalot leaves. I don't know exactly what a lalot tree is, but take it from me those who like this appetizer, like it \"lalot.\"   Since then I've become a regular, any time I'm in the neighbourhood. I feel almost guilty eating here because the food is so ridiculously cheap and good. They should charge more.  I should also mention that the service is also excellent and very friendly.   Try this place and thank me!"}
{"text":"Their Vietnamese dishes are unreal.  so tasty so good so evil.  Also had the wonton noodle soup and the broth was cooked with love I can tell.  They seem to really take pride in their dishes.  Beef Chow Fun was excellent.  There Rainbow ice drink is the only place in the city I know of where it's on a menu.  Everytime I come to the strip for groceries and my vice, Rivers Casino,  got stop at Dormont even though the tunnel and bridge is a mess.  If you're local, I'm jealous but may be a good thing I'm not cuz I remember the good ole days of Freshman 15."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a quick take-out lunch and was pretty pleased.  Deep fried spring rolls were long and quite thin, but had a great texture and nice seasoning. Fried wontons on the other hand seemed more bland, with no real ginger or scallion kick to the filling and a wrapper that had been fried to the point of almost crumbling to dust.  Curried chicken Bun is what pushed this review to above average though. Meaty chicken breast meat (a + or a - depending on your preference...I'm a thigh man myself) was coated in yellow curry and studded with flecks of dried red chili. The chicken had a resulting heat kick that was offset by the cool noodles and cucumber, and nicely balanced with the shredded basil that came alongside the rest of the veg. The basil, while common with a bowl of Pho, isn't something I've really ever seen on Bun anywhere else, but is a nice touch.  Ambiance is pretty classic 17th ave noodle house, though there appeared to be a woman (accountant? insurance agent?) working in an entirely separate glassed off office space taking up most of the window along the front. Would be supper easy get a tasty noodle lunch delivered, though could be a little awkward those days you just feel like ordering a pizza."}
{"text":"Mekong is a good place to stop for Vietnamese food.   I tried the vermicelli noodles (bun) with beef and special beef cubes on rice. Both of which were pretty tasty.   I have not tried their pho yet, but I will be back to try it!  It has definitely made it into my list of Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"I've only gone here once and got the veggie lo mein... It was terrible. Seriously could hardly eat it. Wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"We live in Mt. Lebanon and decided to give MeKong a try. What a great decision. We ordered take out and the lady who took our order was super friendly. When we went to pick it up, the same person was so nice in person and very welcoming. We ordered the Garlic Chicken and the Szechuan Chicken. Both were excellent. It's very small, with only 9 tables, and it's an old building, but that's part of the charm. We'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Small friendly place to grab some great PHO. Before you blink it is on the table. I do take away and eat in. Both work and are a decent price like when I was in viet nan. Well not quite but still great."}
{"text":"Mekong is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant  in calgary. Service is warm and kind. Food is even better. I go here about once a week. And they know my order by heart."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful dinner with my husband. We started with the Crystal Rolls which is their name for a fresh spring roll. They were delicious. We then split the Vietnamese Hoagie and the Vietnamese Noodles with chicken. Both were very good. We took the noodle dish up a notch by adding some sirachi and the peanut sauce that was left over from the spring rolls. Our server, Lisa couldn't have been nicer (I'm assuming she is also the owner).  It wasn't as crowded as we expected because of the construction that just finished on Potomac. It's a small place so we were pleased. We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place to eat in the heart of Dormont!!!! The service is superb, as this is a family run business and they all work together to make your dinner special. Not one bad thing to say about this gem. My husband and I used to live in Dormont and would eat here very often. We still stop in from time to time and couldn't be happier. I would suggest trying the steamed dumplings or the spring rolls as an appetizer. Their hot and sour soup is the best I've ever had, it has a delicious smoky, peppery taste to it. For an entree I usually get the green jade chicken and add mushrooms. That's what's so nice about this place, they let you customize your order to an extent. Definitely giving the customer what they want. Try the Emperor's Chicken for a sweet tang, or the Pho. Their pho will NOT disappoint you. I've sampled or tried probably everything on this menu and I've never been disappointed. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Pho! Flavored so perfectly you don't need to add extra sriracha or hoisin sauce. They also provide plenty of rice (asian approved) and are so generous with their entree portions that I always have enough left to take for lunch the next day. The family that runs the place is so wonderful and nice :)"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We always get the family meal deal and they are awesome about changing it up a bit.  When you ask for extra spicy you get extra spicy.  The only complaint we always have is about the fried rice.  Last night it was burnt. My boyfriend usually ends up adding soy sauce to it.  The spring rolls are delicious! My favorite is the green jade veggie dish. I love the veggie blend."}
{"text":"We came here this past Friday after my husband's tattoo appointment.  We walked in and nobody greeted us, but another table of diners said it was a sit anywhere. It is a BYOB establishment, which I wish I had known previous to entering and sitting down. The woman who waited on us said we could run around the corner to the Wine and Spirits shop, but we declined.  The drinks available are canned sodas (pop to the Yinzer population). The iced tea was a bit weak. The Dragon and Phoenix soup was extremely delicious. We ordered the Pu Pu Platter. The Teriyaki Beef that is on most all platters was not some thin strip of beef you can see through. It was thick and juicy while still being thin enough to skewer. The fried wontons didn't have a lot of insides to them, but they were very crispy. The duck sauce tasted homemade and I just wanted to eat a whole bowl of the stuff. The spring rolls have pork in them (you are told ahead of time about this) and were crispy but not fried.  We inquired about the Emperor Shrimp (chicken was available as well). They said it was their specialty and it was a combination of General Tso's and Sweet and Sour. Let me tell you, this was amazing. There was a spicy heat to it that was superbly balanced by the sweetness. I have eaten in a lot of Chinese restaurants and I have tasted nothing like this EVER!! My husband was definitely in love. The portions are nice sized and great if you are hungry or definite leftovers if you are not. I made mention of my enjoyment of the duck sauce and they enclosed a whole container of the stuff in our leftover bag. They also gave us some more white rice as we only had a small portion left from our meal. We are in Dormont frequently and will definitely be coming back with my BYOB."}
{"text":"This was the first time eating here. My husband and I were very pleased with the service and the food. It's a small place, and appeared to be a hot spot for take-out, but there was plenty of seating and it was very clean. The steamed dumplings were amazing. A must order...maybe two orders. The tea was tasty. We are really use to amazing Vietnamese food from Seattle and this felt very authentic. We will return for sure. If you are thinking about dessert, don't go to the yogurt place down the street."}
{"text":"The owner cooks really delicious authentic Vietnamese dishes. We always have the pho, and this time the pancake amazed us. Their dipping sauce is homemade, fresh and delicious. Mammasan's service is very welcome and good too."}
{"text":"We moved from Pittsburgh to San Francisco and this is the Chinese food we miss the most! The cream cheese wontons specifically! Family owned and operated and home cooked! You won't be disappointed! Staff are always overly friendly! :)"}
{"text":"What happened to this place!? We ordered the same Mekong noodles and Singapore Street noodles we'd been ordering for years that were so delicious, but these tasted nothing like before. It was like they dumped boiled noodles, a bunch of raw vegetables, and a packet of soy sauce in a container. I suspect that this place changed ownership, and it has changed for the worse. We will never get anything from them again. Everything we ordered ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"I love the food from Mekong!! The owners are very nice and the service is fast! The food portions are very big and delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have been to many.Chinese / Vietnamese  places. This one was by far the best..the owners are more than nice. The food was cheap, but amazing. A very nice experience. They go out of their easy to makev your study memorable. Incredible.. go they there."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was amazing!  I went with a friend from Vietnam and she spoke Vietnamese with the server/owner and she said it was very authentic.  We ordered fresh spring rolls and added hot sauce to the dipping sauce that comes with it.  We also ordered Pho Beef and the Hong Kong RIce Noodle Soup (they get the noodles from NYC I think she said they are special) and a vietnamese omellete with cucumber slices and fresh herbs on the side with fish sauce for dipping (which I don't even think is on the menu but I highly recommend it as it is absolutely delicious!)   My friend and I like to seek out Vietnamese food in the area and are very happy we found this restaurant!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Honestly I thought this place was pretty average. They serve your typical Chinese cuisine. It's edible, but nothing out of this world. Then again, I am Chinese so I could end up having higher standards for Asian cuisine than your average consumer. It is nice that they have pho but it's really quite ordinary."}
{"text":"I love the number 40, vermicelli noodles with spring rolls and a scewer of chicken.  Best in town because they add a lot of toppings like cucumber, carrot, peanuts, lettuce, sprouts and basil.  Most other vietnamese restaurants are not as generous.  I've only ever done take-out as I work close by."}
{"text":"A sad day for the Chinese food lovers of Pittsburgh.  Although I live in Cleveland these days, we'd still make excuses to pass through Pgh anytime we were within 50 miles, strictly to hit Mekong.  But last night we were in for a rude surprise.  First off, we called while still a couple hours out, and got a strange voice on the other end of the line.  Well, maybe they hired someone new.  Then when we got there, we noticed a subtle change in the decor.  And the menus were different.  But most importantly, no Theresa or her husband to greet us.  Things went downhill from there.  I ordered my usual, kung pao chicken, which I order at such pyrotechnic levels of heat, it would make a grown man cry.  But Theresa and I had come to an understanding over the years, such that when I walked in the door, she'd go to the kitchen door and yell, \"HEY, MOM....IT'S THAT CRAZY GUY!!!\"  I got it with hot 'n' sour soup, another slice of Mekong yumminess.  The soup was obviously wrong, but not unpleasant.  Nowhere near as good as normal.  Then came the kung pao, which not only wasn't spicy (by my standards), it was just....wrong.  Like the stuff you'd get from the worst kind of generic Chinese restaurant.  Nothing special about it at all.  My wife got her usual, broccoli and chicken lo mein, and it was awful.  I tasted it, and while my kung pao was no better or worse than average Chinese fare, hers was like what you'd get at the mall food court.  Horrible.  On top of everything else, the prices are all higher than what Mekong used to charge, so now you're paying more money for below-average Chinese.  I don't know what happened to the original family...since we only hit Mekong about once every couple months now, we never heard anything.  Does anyone have any information?  Did they move and hopefully start a restaurant elsewhere?  Did something happen to the chef, Theresa's mom?  What gives???  RIP Mekong.  Our most salient reason to visit Pgh is now gone."}
{"text":"So I'll make this one short like my experience. I went in for pickup during lunch since I work in the area. I ordered a pint of rice and a regular egg roll. I sent a coworker to pick it up so when they gave him a huge thing of rice and a shrimp egg roll he didn't know to not accept it. $8 more than what I wanted to spend. So the rice was greasy and the onions were too raw. The egg-roll was unexpected. The crust was good (I like a good crust) but something on the inside wasn't agreeing with my taste buds so I tossed it. Needless to say I'm poorer and still hungry after visiting here. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Mekong is one of my favorite vietnamese noodle place near my work.  When I come here, I usually have their #27 (Vietnamese Beef Stew with a choice of vermicelli, egg, clear, or rice noodles).  I usually order it with either rice noodles or egg noodles.  The reason I order this is that not every pho place have this on their menu and Mekong makes a pretty good beef stew.    Just to echo other reviews, this place doesn't cheap out on just giving you the bare minimum amount of meat that other restaurants do.  I have been coming to this place for years and will do so for many years to come."}
{"text":"Pleas read.  Under new ownership. What use to be a high 4.5 experience is now about a 1.  The food has no flavor."}
{"text":"Three times I've been here and three times I've left satisfied. All three dishes were excellent. ( Chicken and broccoli in spicy brown sauce , Pho  and Mekong noodles.) Wonton soup and egg rolls are home made and extra tasty.   Have only been here for lunch. But I'm sure it's just a good for dinner.   Staff is friendly and helpful. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Chinese retaraunts in Pittsburgh. The staff is super friendly and attentive, and everything I've ever tired off the menu has been delicious. All of the dishes are cooked fresh and to order as well.  Some of the highlights:  The in-house made Duck Sauce is amazing and slightly addictive. The Pho is delectable and always cooked to perfection, the veggies crunchy and the meat tender The Mekong noodles are excellent as well, blending flavors perfectly.  The only downside is they have no desserts."}
{"text":"This was decent and very fresh. I liked sitting inside, very cozy but they deliver too. We will try it again for sure . The Vietnamese egg rolls were great! We had the restaurant to ourselves, but they had a lot of to go orders. They deliver too! Spicy pork n noodle dish was solid."}
{"text":"New owners and new dishes!! They have pho and banh mi sandwiches now! A little pricier than most places I've been to but it's in walking distance which saves me time having to drive downtown. Staff is super friendly and the food is worth it"}
{"text":"Best in the burgh. A very nice, small, and very friendly Chinese restaurant. They have good lunch deals and there pricing isn't too bad either also they offer delivery service.   If you stop in I suggest you try there appetizers very good also ask for the home made spicy mustard its very sweet and tangy but has a good kick to it."}
{"text":"After multiple owners, the food has definitely changed a ton over the years! My dad use to own this place while I was growing up. Used to be called Bamboo Bistro. I've ordered to go from here several times and for the quality and quantity of the food. I strongly believe that it's overpriced and lacks authenticity of what the dish should be. Such a shame. I spent over 10 years of my childhood in this place."}
{"text":"Being hungry for Asian food in the south hills can leave one feeling a bit empty with the choices available, especially if you aren't in the mood for a belly full of cornstarch. Seeing that Mekong had Pho and good ratings, we were off to give it a shot. We entered a mostly empty restaurant with only a handful of tables and what seemed to be one woman running the front and back(I later found out there is another woman in the kitchen).  We were told to sit anywhere we'd like and immediately given water. We looked at the menu, standard american-chinese fare with some vietnamese specialties thrown in, including the Pho I had come for. My brother is a fan of General Tso's but wasn't exactly in the mood for it, so our waitress recommended he try the specialty 'Emperor' Chicken - apparently a bit more sweet and sour than your basic General Tso's.   Along with ordering, I indicated that my brother was severely allergic to nuts of all sorts, expecting to be given the standard response of 'oh, I'll check' or a vague 'they're cooked in the same area.. how allergic is he?'. No, the server, who referred to herself as Ma, explained that only two types of dished contained nuts, and that they were kept in a plastic container away from the other ingredients - completely reassuring us that no mix-ups could happen.  The food came out fairly quickly, the pho was hot but without standard items like sriracha and hoisin. No matter, the flavor was perfect, probably my favorite in the city. I was in the mood for spicy, so I did indeed ask for sriracha. She said she didn't give it because it gives the pho a lemony off-taste if you use too much of it, but that she could help me out. She went into the kitchen and brought out a small dish containing a finely sliced, bright red thai chili, warning a little goes a long way. I'm no stranger to this type of chili and throwing the whole thing in did indeed give me plenty of heat and burst of super-fresh chili flavor. I asked for a small bowl to share and she was happy to deliver that as well.  The Emperor Chicken was OK, full of large chunks of red and green peppers and onions if you like that - I prefer broccoli as my vegetable in dishes like that. It was bright and flavorful, though, and a large portion. Ma was friendly with us while we ate, asking whereabout we lived, and telling us anytime we needed to eat something good, just come see her.  All in all, this place has wonderful Pho. If you're trapped in the South Hills looking for something warm to fill you up, or just looking for a great family-run restaurant with friendly service and great chinese-american food, stop in and give Mekong a try."}
{"text":"\"Too much sauce\"! I use that slang term in a positive way! As in, it's fantastic! This is a wonderful small joint located in a small downtown area! The general tso's dish along with many others are flavored just right and the staff is so polite! Five stars!!!!"}
{"text":"A dish I'm always compelled to try if it's on the menu is Beef Satay.  I still hold number 52 at Bagolacs the best I've ever had, but Mekong's spicy beef number 19 gives it a run for its money.  Very nice flavour and really affordable at around $7 for a large.  The restaurant is relatively simple and service is OK, but the prices and food quality make Mekong a great spot for a good meal if your in the area."}
{"text":"We were in town for a film festival and tried this place on a whim...it did not disappoint.   Our waitress was nice & super attentive to our table. The menu was just the right size for the place & prices are average.   My wife ordered the lemon chicken & I ordered the orange chicken. When the food arrived I was brought walnut chicken instead of orange, but decided to roll with it. I was pleasantly surprised that the mistake turned out to be a win in my book. When we're in the area & craving Chinese food we'll be stopping here."}
{"text":"Wonderful Pho, great friendly service! We went very hungry and ordered more then what 2 people should eat, thinking we'd take some home with us. Lol it was so delicious we ate every drop! Very generous portions means we were real pigs! Can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"I ordered dinner from Mekong the other night while Darren was at a concert. The sweet and sour pork was tasty as were the steamed dumplings. Ordering was a snap over the phone (the employees are fluent in English and are therefore easy to communicate with) and the delivery was quick."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to start.  I see earlier reviews with 4 or 5 stars, back in 2013 and earlier.  Something must have happened.  New ownership?  New menu?  Cutting corners?  I don't know...but it most certainly is not 4 or 5 stars anymore.    Four of us went here for lunch - thought we'd give it a shot.  We each got a lunch special which came with either soup or a egg roll.  I opted for the egg roll and it was over fried and very doughy.  Borderline soggy on the inside.  It wasn't particularly tasty either.  I ate it though, because I was very hungry.  I ordered sweet and sour tofu for lunch.  When it came, the appearance was puzzling.  The sauce was brown, and the tofu looked like sandpaper.  The only vegetables that were in the dish were broccoli and bok choy (i think that's what it was.)  The sweet and sour sauce, which often times is too thick and pasty for my liking was actually way too thin and tasted like it was watered down. It also didn't taste like sweet and sour sauce either.  The rice was good - fluffy and well cooked.  The broccoli was well cooked too - crisp and not too over done.  Those are the only two things I can say about the meal.  I couldn't eat the tofu (appearance aside, it was also terribly cooked), and I left over half my meal on the plate.    Two of the other people I was with also did not really like their meals either, noting the chicken tasting freezer burnt and/or overdone in old oil.    The fourth person in our party said their meal 'wasn't bad'.  The whole place smells of fryer oil as well.    Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Meh. Just okay.  We ordered this for delivery because we wanted to try something in the area other than Katana. The Yelp app would not cooperate; fortunately, their website has online ordering too. Another cool feature is you can pay thru PayPal on their site, and add a tip too, so when they come to the door you grab your food and you're good to go! No more trying to sign your name in your palm or on your spouses back! Yippee! Technology!   On their website, the entrees do not specify whether or not they come with rice, even when you add it to your cart. So, I ordered 2 general tsos chicken dinners, an order of (2) egg rolls, and a small side of both fried rice and white rice. Well, it turns out they do come with a small side of white rice, so no need for all those extra orders of rice. *facepalm*  The order of egg rolls were fantastic and I wished I had ordered 2 for each of us because we gobbled them up in 2 seconds.    The chicken was just okay. Some pieces were just super soft and a bit gamey if I'm being honest. Also, it was notably much spicier than any other general Tsos we have had so keep that in mind! The fried rice was very good, and was actually rice fried with vegetables and egg, not just white rice with soy sauce dumped on it as so many places do now.  My other problem other than the 'eh chicken' was that unfortunately, when our order arrived, one of the paper takeout containers of chicken was on its side and the sauce got all over everything. Not a huge dealbreaker, but not the best thing to pull out a bunch of soggy, sticky containers that you could otherwise eat out of. It was probably an honest mistake, but hopefully they are able to pack it better in the future.   Im not quite sold on my first experience, but I know where I'm getting my egg rolls! Haha"}
{"text":"The location is convenient with easy parking.  The service was fantastic - fast, attentive, good attention to detail, and very friendly.  The food was fresh, hot, and tasty and met my expectations on all fronts."}
{"text":"NEW MANAGEMENT as of summer 2015. Short review: food, price and service each dropped a star.  Long(ish) review: Before I really get going let me say that the food is still decent, a little blander than before, needs a bit of salt in the noodle water, but I expect them to eventually work out those kinks. The Pho was over cooked and served with the plate of basil and limes that are supposed to accompany the dish. It was over flavored with black pepper and cilantro stems. If that had been the only issue I wouldn't be writing this. But there's more. -1 star for the food, with the potential to earn it back.  As for reasons to reduce my rating, Let's start with price since that's a simple one. The food here was always on the high side, but I'd gotten used to asian being $3 more in Pittsburgh than it is anywhere else. The thing that hurts this review are the additional $2 they now charge for any change you make to the dish. I understand charging a little extra for people who want double on the proteins, but $2 for a handful of veggies when the plate is already $12? No thank you, -1 star, and frankly is indicative of the attitude driving the next sad problem.  The service was an issue. One person manning the restaurant at dinner time for starters, but I can understand that when the place is empty. (That should have been a clue) She was openly rude to customers on the phone while we were sitting not 10 feet away. We were the only people in the place except for one takeout order and one delivery that came in while we waited and it took more than 40 minutes to get food from when we sat down. The old welcoming family owned vibe is completely and utterly gone. -1 heartbreaking to lose star.   All in all, for 3 people we spent $50 for a middle of the road meal in an unwelcoming, empty restaurant that, I fear, has put its better years behind it. I'll probably give the place a try again in 6-12 months because I'm a sucker for Vietnamese food, here's hoping that trip goes better...  Good luck."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for 1st time. Pleasant guy answered to take order & offered advice. Arrived to Beechview in ~35min piping hot by same guy who took the order. Really nice & his mother in law does the cooking. My fave chinese in town is sesame inn so gave it a shot. Hot & sour soup was on point. Real nice hotness & thickness. Chicken egg roll was average & it reminded me how good sesame inns are & i wished i had one. Rice was sticky but nice. Sesame Chicken & Orange chicken both interesting. I asked for white meat. It was good quality but was very soggy which can be typical for takeout. Plenty of tasty sauce but no signs of any vegetables in either. I'd try something different next time around.  Not my favorite ever, but far from the worst. Grade B for food & A for delivery service"}
{"text":"Very authentic Vietnamese food.  Friendly service with smile. Pork chop plate was juicy, Hong Kong style won ton soup awesome, and the grilled chicken salad was tasty. Menu has pictures to better present the menus."}
{"text":"The Pho is phenomenal!! You can only dine-in if you want Pho - the owner told us it is because the noodles can get funny if they sit too long. They strive for authentic and delicious food here.  Their spring rolls are also very good - they are fried, not the cellophane kind. Everything that we have tried on their menu has been great - especially anything pork. The family is so kind - they remember us and what we had the time before and suggest what we may want.  They also deliver within a 2-3 mile radius. Wonderful place."}
{"text":"Simply the best Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary. It's not often I'm in the NE but it's worth the drive to eat here. Really good flavours and satisfying sizes.   Most other Vietnamese restaurants are really bland but here, you'll find fresh ingredients, nice seasoning, tender meat and an assortment of sauces to use.  Would recommend either their Pho or vermicelli bowl. Definitely will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Not the same Mekong I know and loved.  I'm in the process of moving from Dormont so it seems fitting that Mekong has new ownership.  Got my usual Chicken Mekong Noodle and Spring Roll (they were out).  Wish they wouldn't have changed the recipes..."}
{"text":"Pretty average in my opinion. Nothing crazy special but nothing specifically bad either. We were in for lunch during the week so it was not busy. Our server was very nice and helped us promptly. Our food came out quickly. The cheese wontons were very thick and difficult to eat because of this. I thought it would be more like crab Rangoon type of wonton but it was not like this at all. I would not get this again. My pho broth was flavorful with many veggies, just how I like it. My husband liked his general tso's chicken but thought egg drop soup was oily. Prices reasonable. Would stop in here again for some veggie pho when I'm in the mood since it's a convenient location, inexpensive and good I but would probably like to try other places first."}
{"text":"\"We Do Not Guarantee Our Food!\"   And it shows.  OMG WORST FOOD EVER!  Sitting at my table with this mess infront of me.   The General Tso chicken consists of frozen nuggets with factory processed sauce poured over.   The vegetable fried rice is over cooked white rice with red and green peppers,  the egg roll is an undercooked spring roll.   I specifically asked if they served REAL  egg rolls and was told yes. Hot and Sour Soup was thick like lumpy gravy and had only the flavor of black pepper.   It was void of any thing but greasy brown liquid.  I had been looking forward to Chinese all week,  I am so very disappointed.   I called the restaurant to complain and then again to ask for my money back,  which I NEVER do.   I believe in buyer beware but this was SO bad I actually called and said, \"Hi, this is,  gave my address, again.   I want my money back.\" I was told that they don't guarantee their food.   I asked for a name so I could credit the quote but was turned down flat.  I was also informed that  I was not being helped because I was mean about how I talked about the food her mom cooks and feeds to them daily.  For the 30 dollars I got ripped off I recieved a traditional white box of General Tso chicken,  a traditional white box of white rice, 3 undercooked spring rolls and 2 LG.  Containers of sweet and sour soup. Small portions as well for the money.   Keep going through the yelp list for somewhere else."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I've ever had. Period. The wonton soup was bland and had a weird film on it, I guess \"waxy\" would be a good way to describe it. So sick. The craziest part tho was the general tso's chicken. Ok so we've all had this before right? So we're familiar with what it normally is... this general tso's chicken was *and I shit you not* those flat breaded chicken fingers that are normally on kids menus, floating in globs of that orange gelatinous duck sauce. Very bizarre.  I called the restaurant after I got it to ask what was up with this, but I had ordered pretty late and they were already closed."}
{"text":"Note to Pho lovers: They do have it! But I didn't try it. Someday I'll get around to trying Pho.   What I did have were the fried dumplings and General Tso's Shrimp.   The fried dumplings were quite a strong way to open our early dinner. The potsticker wrapping was wispycrispy and not without a little oil undrained from them, which I kinda like. I was told they were filled with chicken which isn't a variation I've ever tried before on this preferred Asian app of mine.  The General Tso's Shrimp was candy-coated, Tempura-battered rawk fury! A gluey, gooey, delight, it went well with that mound of viscous, fluffy white rice.   I tasted my friend's Sweet and Sour Chicken, and man it tasted like a pancake with some chicken inside! I liked it but would have preferred more chicken. With batter that good though, you could almost forgive that slight misstep.   The service was excellent also, and the restaurant itself is nice, clean, cool, and relaxingly informal, the menu moderately priced (2 people=$25. 95 not including tip) . The owner appears to be a fellow Gen-Xer and even had her two little ones bringing us drinks.  \"Mommy, the bald man wants another water,\" the little boy told his mom.    Adorable. I guess ya gotta start 'em young in this business, right?   Now the question is: Who has cuter kids? Tong Garden in Brookline or Mekong Restaurant? I'll leave that up to you to decide.   I'm glad we came here to eat prior to the Scorpions concert. We would have gotten pizza somewhere, but everything else seemed closed today. Thank heavens for people who party too much on July 4th, or else I might not have gotten to try Mekong.   Yeah, why do YOU think half of Pittsburgh was out of business today? Hmmmm?"}
{"text":"Great prices, owner appreciates loyal customers and everything is home made. Been getting Chinese from them for a number of years now."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a while now and I love trying new things. My favorite is the sesame chicken and rice.   I love the friendly staff too! The daughter once dropped a glass on the floor and it shattered and she screamed \"oh no I'm going to get fired!\" A couple seconds later she then said \"oh wait, no I'm not my mom's the boss\". They are just such friendly and down to earth people it makes you appreciate smaller businesses.   I'd love to see the restaurant get a makeover too because I hope they stay open and successful for a long time to come.   I like that they even deliver. When I'm craving good Chinese, I don't hesitate on where to go for a good price."}
{"text":"When my husband and I first moved to Pittsburgh in 2014, Mekong offered authentic-tasting Vietnamese food that was to die for. Everything tasted fresh and the owners handmade the noodles daily, which made them irresistible. We especially loved the shrimp eggrolls as the dough was also homemade and they always came piping hot with wonderful soy sauce on the side. Although the interior wasn't anything special, it was a delicious little spot in Dormont and we enjoyed tasting every homemade item on the menu. However, something has definitely changed. It seems like they have gotten new ownership. Gone are the handmade noodles, the fresh-rolled eggrolls, and the authentic Vietnamese flavor. These have been replaced with cheap, frozen, takeout-quality meals that you can get at any run-of-the-mill Chinese buffet. Actually, a Chinese buffet would be a better choice because it would be much less expensive. The worst casualty is the shrimp eggrolls, which we previously loved so much. The stale pastries are now filled with the chewiest, dirtiest, and most low-quality shrimp you could imagine. They are flavorless and you could find tastier eggrolls in the frozen food section of Market District. You should especially stay away from these \"shrimp\" eggrolls.  Mekong is now an overpriced, low quality pan-Asian takeout restaurant, just like countless others in Pittsburgh. I gave it two stars because the hostess, who is always there, is sweet and does her best to make sure you are well taken care of. However, the food is absolutely no longer worth the wait or the price. You may as well find a Magic Wok and pay less."}
{"text":"Great bowl of beef Pho... Tasty bun thit Nuong.. This is the pLAce I go for Pho whenever I am in calgary.. It is Near the highway and  the service is very good"}
{"text":"Absolutely dismal. We should have been tipped off by being the only 2 people in the place for Friday lunch. The \"server\" was hanging out watching a portable tv. Spring rolls were soggy and almost completely cabbage, plus having an overall odd taste. Wontons were bland as wallpaper paste. The dumplings were ok, but nothing special. My partner ordered pho which just....never came. We waited. And waited. The server kept going back into the kitchen, and we'd think, \"ok maybe now?\" Nothing. Finally having had enough we just told this kid to forget it, we'd pay for what we had eaten. He seemed surprised and his was response was \"oh, there was a misunderstanding, I think it's almost done\". Um, what misunderstanding? We were the only 2 people there. In the duration that we were there ONE person came in to pick up takeout.  In short, don't bother. There are MANY better options for Americanized Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"I found out too late, like many others, that they are under new management. I called in and ordered what I always do, and knew instantly upon opening the box that things were different. My normal order was cashew nuts with roasted pork and a Chinese vegetable soup. I ordered the same thing, but ended up with watery sauce, tough pork, and a really small order of wonton soup. It wasn't the worst thing I've eaten, but I'm really disappointed based on what it used to be. Will miss this place."}
{"text":"The family that runs Mekong is wonderful and it was a delight to dine in their establishment. We had such a nice, mellow meal at Mekong and it was my favorite meal of the trip. The food was as good as the family was friendly. The green jade chicken was my favorite dish of the many we tried. My friends and I shared family style and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"They're under new ownership now, but it still just seems like nothing has changed. My lo mein had no taste, which is a bummer because that's my fave dish. I also thought the chicken tasted weird. I clearly felt fine after eating it, but I'm wondering if it was frozen and then cooked, which makes it get a little mushy.   Funny enough, I'm still open to trying the Pho portion of the restaurant, which is new, but I still worry that it may not have the flavor I'm looking for. Crossing my fingers that dish will be better!"}
{"text":"Once again excellent food here at this cozy restaurant in Dormont.  The Vietnamese pancakes are perfect and so fresh and the spicy noodles and pork were excellent."}
