{"text":"Food was alright. Over priced for what you get. Refused the coupon I had gotten in the mail a few weeks after they opened even though it had no expiry date. Their hours are also inconvenient as they close at 8pm and are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Worst service and food! No one knows what they are doing every order is wrong and I have to go back. Ordered BLT they gave me toast had to go back to get my other toppings. Very overpriced for small portions and dirty place. Save your money go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Been there quite a few times, the food is delicious and service is excellent!! The Basil Beef and Ginger Chicken is a must try!"}
{"text":"I used to buy lunch from here but found it was very expensive for Chinese food or even sandwiches so I've only been getting breakfast from here. 

Most of the staff are friendly but I find they always make mistakes when it comes to putting your food together. 

They may also need a lesson on hygiene. Today, I ordered breakfast and noticed one of the staff cleaning the counters and washing a rag with gloves on. When I placed my order she used the SAME gloves to make my food. I nearly threw up!

When it started to get busy I noticed the cashier went to help out with taking orders/making the food, but she didn't wash her hands. She was touching money and making people's sandwiches! 

The food here is not bad but people deserve clean and healthy food especially if they're paying a lot of money. 

This restaurant has closed down before because they failed the food/safety inspection, I would not be surprised if they closed down again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I ordered food online and was waiting almost two hours for it to deliver. I called several times but nobody answered. Once I was finally able to get a hold of somebody to cancel my order, they said that my order was \"already cancelled\" and that \"they never even started cooking food yet\" and immediately hung up. I was beyond annoyed and then realized that I was going to pay $70 for 4 fried rice and a greek salad. Absolutely do not recommend. Will never be ordering from them again, you would be much more satisfied with some pizza."}
{"text":"So so food. Nothing to write home about, but decent enough for a quick and affordable lunch."}
