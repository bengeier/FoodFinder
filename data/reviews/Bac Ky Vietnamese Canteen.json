{"text":"Sorry Bac Ky, but this last Thursday was a real disappointment.

My fresh spring rolls were flimsy and barely had any shrimp in them. The rolls were skinny and fell apart easily. Not the kind of quality I have usually received from you.

On top of that my chicken pho came warm, not hot. As it was a cold winter night all I wanted was a nice hot chicken noodle soup to warm my soul and make me feel good. Instead I got a lukewarm pho with a ton of noodles, disproportionate to the bowl and also the soup...

Maybe the chef was new or was overworked, but come on, this is easy quality control...

Needless to say I was let down."}
{"text":"What the phock?

I've been to hundreds of Vietnamese restaurants and this was by far the worst I've ever been to.

The Pho broth tastes like sweet and sour sewer water. Inedible, I couldn't finish and had to go and eat elsewhere.

Go here if you want to throw up a little."}
{"text":"i really, really wanted to like this place but was disappointed.  i'm hoping they work things out but if they continue as is i doubt they will be here much longer. :(

i ordered a small beef pho to go.  what i received was a container with rather bland broth and overcooked beef ball halves and a container with mushy noodles, rare beef, onions, cilantro.  i also received chopsticks, a spoon, napkin and two ketchup style packets of hot chili sauce. sorely missed was the thai basil, chili peppers, lime, bean sprouts, and hoisin sauce that are pretty much standard with any other pho place. the soup definitely needed the extra help.  

perhaps it's a much better experience when eating in the restaurant rather than getting it to go. all in all very disappointing."}
{"text":"this place is terrible....Close to king west and by far the cheapest option but nothing to rave about.

If you want real vietnamese food and have the time, walk over to china town and save your money."}
{"text":"Very good, spring rolls need that crust though, excellent \"pork slice\", wonderfully charred with great porky-ness, bun rieu is fantastic!  Flavors have not been dumbed down for King West, good job, represent your culture!"}
{"text":"It took me a while to try this place because of bad reviews. However it's really close to me, so I gave it a go. The Pho Ga and Shrimp Fresh Rolls were really good. I can't say it's the greatest Pho I've had, but I think some are being a little harsh. It's worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. The ambience and the food. I like how it's a cool place to eat in and the food is well prepared and priced. Also quick for take out. I had the small chicken pho and ordered one each of the veggie spring roll and the shrimp summer roll."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly for about six months now. Since winter set in I visit at least once a week. Best pho I've ever had, at a great price, too. I have a very healthy appetite and the small beef pho is more than enough for me. Service is quick, you pay upfront so when you're ready to go you can just bounce. I love this place. Definitely underrated based on the stars it has. Five stars, no question."}
{"text":"i liked this place because the broth was flavorful although a little too light.  Their meat however could improve quite substantially."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like it, staff was great, good price point but the soup was sooooo bland. Throughly disappointed as I live close and was hoping to become a regular."}
{"text":"The hunt for good pho in Toronto continues.  I was really hoping that someone had finally come along and elevated pho beyond something more than just the late night chinatown stop or hangover cure.  Something along the lines of what Bahn Mi Boys did for the Vietnamese sub.  Unfortunately this isn't it.

Its the same old pho presented in the same way you'll find in any Vietnamese pho joint.  Although a bit more expensive and window dressed with cool music and an attempt at creating a more hip environment, this is King Street after all.

Pho Hung and Pho Pasteur is still as notch above, albeit possibly laced with MSG, of which I did not detect at Bac Ky.  A cleaner but less flavourful broth and with slightly thinner noodles.  The rare beef was hardly rare by the time it arrived to the table which like any other rare beef pho you end up having to peel its layers away in order not to consume half your beef in one bite.  Bac Ky does seem to be positioning itself as a healthier version of a pho restaurant with its Vega health smoothies.  An odd, but interesting choice.

Also long legged people beware.  If you hate Nana's recreation of the street food alley with its tiny plastic stools you'll find a similar experience here.  Short, although more comfortable, stools than Nana still leave my legs wanting a good stretch afterwards.

Bac Ky is still in its infancy and I'm hoping they can still find a way to raise the bar for pho.  Even a bit of creativity and ingenuity would be all it needs to raise itself above Toronto's sea of pho mediocrity."}
{"text":"Having been wanting to go this place for a long time, I finally went couple of days ago and actually enjoyed the food. Tried the Bun (Mixed Vegetables) and Pho (Tofu and the Vegan Spicy Tom Yum). I liked them both! The Spicy Pho was actually really flavorful especially with the lemongrass and its probably going to be my staple comfort food  in the cold/winter days to come. The Bun was also good but I felt it needs more flavor and spices. If it could mimic at least a bit of the flavor that is found in the Vegan Pho, this dish would definitely be a hit! Since its a vegan dish I was surprised when fish sauce was offered as a side. My suggestion to the owners of this place is when the dish is vegan the sauce should be vegan as well or else it defeats the purpose. The folks at this place were really warm and welcoming and were helpful in making us understand the menu. Highly recommend it and would definitely visit this place again!"}
{"text":"My go to Pho spot when I'm downtown. You pay before eating but that makes leaving easier. I have tried the vegan pho & tom yum soup, both awesome. The small is a good portion if you're looking to have no leftovers. Affordable with fast service"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and excellent. Not sure where Leesa's 1 star review is coming from but she's a hater and whats with the racist white references LOL. The other negative reviews are just not true.  The food here is fresh, tasty and Im sorry but going to Chinatown is sometimes a crap shoot and there is great pho all over the city and the pho at Back Ky is worth a visit and try.  The place is cozy, well decorated and at least isn't dodgy like some other pho places.   Stop being haters bad reviewers and grow up.  This place rocks."}
{"text":"Delicious broth. Fresh veggies. Good qualify. Great mango matcha smoothies! Staff are nice too."}
{"text":"Small but charming Vietnamese canteen on King street west with a small menu.  I've only tried their pho ga and it was one of the better ones that I've tried.  I can't comment on their beef pho or bun though.  A nice little place."}
{"text":"Co-workers have been reco'ing this spot for a while and I can now agree with them. Great food, affordable prices and atmosphere - chill decor and music (not blaring - why do places have to crank the music up to \"11\"?!). Definitely going back - we had the Pho beef, Pho chicken, pork fresh rolls, vegetable spring rolls and iced Vietnamese coffee. Everyone left full and smiling."}
{"text":"My husband tonight gave me a choice of Porchetta & Co, Pizzeria Libretto or Bac Ky for dinner.  I chose Bac Ky, and later felt like I needed to apologize for it.

While the food was okay (nothing special or better than what you can find in Chinatown for less $), it was the unwelcoming and seemingly uncaring service that was really disappointing.

With so many choices in downtown Toronto, we certainly don't have to go to an establishment where the feeling is that we're intruding rather than appreciated for our business."}
{"text":"I've been here probably ten times. It's really good, fresh, simple food. Idk how 'authentic' it is, but it's definitely tasty. It's fast service and really cheap for the area. Eat in area is small but very cozy and takeout service is very fast."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to King street, especially for lunch/takeout.  Have gotten the Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup) + shrimp fresh rolls a few times now, and I've enjoyed it every time. Need to check out the other options now. PS - love the hip hop / r & b playing."}
{"text":"Didn't have much expectations because of the bad reviews, but overall was great and would definitely come back! Highly recommend the rice rolls, we ordered the shrimp one, and the peanut sauce was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"A great addition to the area, nice staff but a bit of a let down on the food.
If you are used to visit other vietnamese, you may find this one a bit blend and not remarkable at all. Just ok."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while because I love Bun a ha and it can be hard to find in this part of the city (walking distance). The grilled pork was delicious, with a bit of char that I like. The portions for noodles were generous with a good mix of shredded veggies and peanuts. The only thing that could use some improvement is the sauce, which was rather bland. I am never one to add sriracha, but adding it made the dish a hit for me. Not sure if they have it in stores though because I got take out. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"What you'll get at Bac Ky is friendly service and a good vibe.  

There is usually one person on the floor and they function as both a server and clerk.  You may have to wait a little to be served/have your order taken, but they are highly efficient and thus quick to get to you.  They won't check up on you like other sit down restaurants, but they will be prompt with helping you while mixing in a little small talk.

Decor-wise, they use slightly worn down furniture with black, red and bronze making up the main colour palette throughout the small sit-down space.  The fact that the furniture has been worn down may make the room seem unsanitary, but it is actually very clean inside and the weathered look gives the place some extra character.  With retro music playing in the background that isn't  overpoweringly and set at just the right volume to allow conversations to be heard, Bac Ky creates a funky atmosphere for diners. 

The food, however, will rub you the wrong way. I decided to try pho here for lunch.  They serve various types of basic pho and even a vegan version for a more environmentally friendly appetite.  With beef as their most popular choice, I placed my bets on that and ordered it in size Large.  However, what I got was Small at best. Sure, they use a large ceramic bowl that is similar in size to what you would find at pho vendors in Scarborough/North York that also serve size Large.  Unfortunately, unlike other vendors, the pho here was mainly composed of broth with little noodle and meat.  I would have gotten the same amount of noodles if I ordered a size Small at one of my regular vendors in Scarborough. To pay more for a portion size that left me hungry was a bit absurd.  Also, adding fuel to the fire was the meat.  You get flank, red meat, and beef balls when you order the beef pho, but all three were sub-par when I visited. The flank was like chewing rubber, the red meat slices were thin and small in size, and the beef balls were not thoroughly cooked through.  Lastly, the broth, which is the heart of pho, lacked depth and a rich flavour, tasting much like water mixed with a light broth. I would not recommend the pho by a long shot and will most likely not return to Bac Ky."}
{"text":"I like having a Vietnamese place close to home. I've already been here about a dozen times and its usually quite good, although I have seen a slight decline in the quality of meat since we started going.  I'm worried that the quality of food will continue to decline, please don't let that happen! 

I love the avocado fresh rolls & beef pho. I always ask for substitutions (cause I'm annoying that way) and they're always happy to give in to my irritating requests."}
{"text":"Pho is my favorite food along with pizza. I love it. I've been a vegetarian for a while and haven't  found a satisfying pho, until Bac Ky. The mushroom broth is so good.  The service is really sweet. The ambience is great. The avocado spring rolls are awesome too. If you don't eat meat but are passionate about pho, support this place"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT for smoothies.

Ok - bear with me for a second. Yes, this Bac Ky serves Pho. Yes, they have an unreal location on King St. West. Yes, they have hilarious chalk signs in front at almost all hours of the day ...and YES, I did say smoothies.

Bac Ky's smoothie selection is great. Despite being known for Vietnamese food, their menu offers a wide variety of fresh and healthy smoothies that are great on the go. My work has made our trips somewhat of a smoothie routine, and I would highly suggest you do the same.

If you're looking for a healthy alternative to your morning frappuccino or are curious to see what kind of smoothies are available at a Pho place - definitely check this place out.

P.s. their bar server is a gem."}
{"text":"Pho portion was much smaller than other places, and at a higher cost. Beef was really dry and old. There are definitely better options out there for pho, not sure about rice dishes."}
{"text":"Broth tasted amazing. Chicken tastes like it was cooked in the microwave, my partner enjoyed the beef though. Noodles were thick and just okay.."}
{"text":"I do not understand Vietnamese cuisine but I know when I am eating healthy, authentic food with high quality ingredients, made with care. I had the mango salad and the chicken noodle soup and it was a nice combination of subtle herbs and seasoning, fresh meat and vegetables, almost no fat, so light and gluten free even!
For your healthy day! Not expensive and has an absolutely great (even meaningful) decor reminding us of a red past."}
{"text":"I live next to this place to decided to check it out and was glad I did.  I had the Tom Yum soup which was great!!!  I also had some spring rolls which were yummy as well.  I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and even better music. Every time I eat here I just sit with Shazam open the entire time perfecting my music collection."}
{"text":"Went here to try a new place for lunch and lets say 'save your money'.
I am not a Pho expert or anything but this place is a joke!

Location : convenience
Food : who are we catering too? I understand Caucasian people won't know the difference but we live in such a diverse city that I'm sure the whitest person can tell if it's good 'pho' or bad Pho.

I ordered a Pho Ga - which tasted like MSG watered down, and the bean sprouts were not even fresh! The chicken were cut into the smallest pieces. Ugh!
Next, I ordered an avocado milkshake which was the worst $5.50 wasted again!!!!! It was like 1/4 of an avocado maybe less? A ton of almond milk that was warm and maybe a tiny bit of condensed milk and no ice! It was so warm I couldn't even finish it. It was basically a blended almond milk with a little slice of avocado.

Do yourself a favor, go to Ginger which is probably better than this place OR talk a walk to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Shrimp fresh rolls: 3.5/5
I find the quality for these to be inconsistent. Sometimes, they are rolled well (nice and tight), while other times they're hard to eat. The dipping sauce also seems to vary - sometimes very spicy, other times not. I wish they would bring you extra side plates to eat these on because they can get very messy and the dish it comes on isn't good when sharing between a party of 2.

Beef pho: 3/5
I wouldn't say the pho is particularly good, but it fills the pho craving if you're having one. The small is definitely kind of small though, so order up if you're hungry!

Bun with pork slice: 4/5
Tastier than the pho. The pork is flavourful and the spring roll is good too. Comes with traditional sides of pickled radish and carrot. The fish sauce is pretty watered down though. I sometimes need to ask for a refill. However, I did grow up with parents who make a very potent nuoc mam so perhaps it's just preference.

Vietnamese coffee: 4/5
If you like Vietnamese coffee, this place does not disappoint. I've had some that were amazing here, and then others that were okay. Maybe it depends on who makes it for you?

Service: 3/5
You order at the cash register and pay first. You take a number to your seat and they bring the food out to you. Nothing fancy and nothing very friendly. Water is self serve. A couple times I find the self-serve water is low/cups are few.

Overall, I find Bac Ky to be an acceptable option if you're craving Viet food in the King West area and don't want to trek to Chinatown. Good for a quick meal that doesn't cost an arm & a leg.

P.S. - I do enjoy the old school hip hop and rap they play in the restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"I work nearby, and sometimes craving for Vietnamese pho and Chinatown is too far of walk during lunch. So this place is just right for me, however comparing with Chinatown the quality and the price are obvious not as good, but is decent and clean."}
{"text":"Horrible bland pho. Never coming back. It taste like water! I'm serious, there is absolutely no flavourful in the broth. More expensive and really bad food compared to most Viet restaurants"}
{"text":"I come for the vegan pho and it's good. Mushroom broth based and now a new option: vegan tomyum pho. 

Glad to have a decent Vietnamese option on King! 

They also have a blessed 90s hip hop and r&b playlist spinning at a nice chill level."}
{"text":"Contrary to the standard pho restaurant, this place looks like it has some personality. The interior decor is clean, has some flavour to it, and it doesn't look like the backroom of a warehouse. This may turn off some of the \"purists\" when it comes to Viet cuisine.

I had the beef pho and the Vietnamese coffee, and I have mixed reviews. The coffee was perfect - not too sweet and unlike some places, the cup doesn't come half-full with ice cubes. The pho had a decent broth, but it was somewhat lukewarm and the portions were smaller than expected. I didn't like the fact that you don't get to select the cuts of beef that go into the pho. I don't like tripe and beef balls in my pho, and I don't have the option to remove these parts from my meal.

Also, the place has a self-serve tap water station. I understand that it's a pretty bare-bones restaurant layout, but it's a chore to go up to the water station every time you need a drink."}
{"text":"food was good, I had the beef pho.  I'm not a huge pho connoisseur but I liked it.  wife and cousin has vermicelli, looked better than my pho.  feel as though there may have been some offal, nondescript  meat products to be sure.

I would return"}
{"text":"I did not have the pho like others so I cannot comment on the pho. But Viet food is more than just pho.

What we did try:

Bun rieu 4/5
less salt, less meat, and less egg than the norm. Overall theyre just going healthier with their recipe. It can use more egg, like the whole bowl should be covered with that tasty egg on top

Bun with pork slice 5/5
It's excellent, the pork tastes great, the spring rolls are pretty tasty. It's a great dish. But their fish sauce needs maybe more sugar and vinegar. 

Matcha mango smoothie 4/5
It tastes like matcha.. With mango.. And some small pieces of mango sunk to the bottom.

Note: you order and pay before you get the food."}
{"text":"As the only Vietnamese place on the block,  was hoping the pho would have been better.  Broth was flavourful, but lacked the aromatic aroma of other pho places.  I think they played down the authenticity for the neighborhood. Very little meat, and noodles in the large bowl for $11.95. 

The owners could make a killing if they turned this into a bar,  and served more authentic Vietnamese food.  Dim the lights and turn this into something cool Pls.  Average pho."}
{"text":"Loved the service here but the pho is meh...

OK I feel like maybe my review isn't entirely fair because the two times I ate here was through pick-up so I never really sat down and dined. I know that with noodle soups like pho, takeout always downgrades the quality, so hence the three stars because I'm giving Bac Ky the benefit of the doubt. 

Anyway, I have tried:
-Beef Pho, which was decent. It wasn't bad but I found the portion quite small for the price (like $9). Definitely wasn't the BEST pho I had, but it wasn't bad.

-Chicken Pho. Don't even. I mean my pho craving was somewhat satisfied but only after I drowned it in siracha and hoisin sauce... The chicken was dry AF, and it usually is for chicken pho but I could not eat it. On top of that, I had hella chicken bones in my soup... The noodles felt a little undercooked also. The taste was just off, I don't know if I had a bad batch or what but I don't recommend it. 

I LOVE the convenience of this place and how easy it is to order online + pick up but overall with the price and quality, this place is not a go-to. Also heard from my coffee-connoisseur boss that the viet coffee here is not good so maybe that's another thing to stay away from."}
{"text":"I tried Bun Rieu and it was very bad. Don't any meat, just fries tofu and tomatoes. Don't try this if you don't want to be disappointed. Expensive compared to other vietnamese food places"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Prices were reasonable. The pho...was the most bland pho I've ever tasted, period. It was basically warm water. The meat *in* the pho was so dry that it might as well have been cardboard. So yeah, I ordered pho and got back warm cardboard water. 

On the plus side, the spring rolls were good."}
{"text":"Good enough! Prices same as in Chinatown which was a pleasant surprise given the location. Not the best Pho ever, but so close to home and perfectly located for those hangover/craving days. A great addition to the hood and I hope it stays cuz I needs my Pho when I wants my Pho. Fresher herbs and beans sprouts and beer would be great, please!"}
{"text":"It used to be my favourite Vietnamese restaurant but lately their dishes are not so good as they used to be. We used to come in often for Pho (we realized that veggie Pho was the best - the most flavourful) and their Fresh Avocado Rolls with Peanut Sauce were divine... well, not anymore. Our last few visits left us disappointed as the Pho was missing taste - no salt, no flavour and Avocado Rolls barely had any avocado in it. I mean, they used to be full of avocado- so delicious. But now it's mostly noodles... no, thanks. And once the avocado was all brown and ugly, I had to ask for another portion. Will look for new place. Maybe their chef changed, not sure what happened here..."}
{"text":"3.5/5

*The term bac ky is actually a derogatory term for people from Northern Vietnam (like me). I'm not offended by any means and apparently the owners picked that term to pay tribute to their parents, who came to Canada from a city in Northern Vietnam.. Quite strange.

*The menu was pretty basic for any Vietnamese restaurants with a few options for each categories. I was surprised to see that everything is priced under $10, which is really rare for a restaurant in King Street West. 

-Shrimp Fresh Roll - $5
The roll was well-made and refreshing with lettuce, bean sprouts and the carrots were slightly tangy. The fish sauce was disappointing as it was extremely watered down. A bit more fish sauce and few slices of red chilies would do the trick :)

-Bun Rieu (vermicelli noodles, chicken soup broth, fresh tomatoes, dried tofu, crab meat balls made with ground pork, egg, crab paste) - $8.80
it was way much better than the one I had at Banh Mi Bar! It was light and not too oily along with stewed tomatoes that contributed a slightly tart and natural sweetness to the dish. However the soup was a bit salty for my taste and there was too much broth for the amount of noodles and meat in the dish. I also found that since the soup had been modified to be healthier, the broth doesn't have as much depth of flavor as the ones I had in Vietnam. But I supposed this will have to do if you are craving for bun rieu and unwilling to travel outside of Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was pleasant but really unremarkable. I had pho and the cabbage salad. Broth and meat were pretty unspectacular and not tasty. I ate it with hot sauce. It is a nice cosy atmosphere and the friendly service means that I would still go back if I find myself hungry and in the area in need of a quick easy bite."}
{"text":"new and promising. aimed at local residents as one of the few Asian offerings on King W, for lunch, after work or post-gym take away. more like a home made joint with cool music and that backpacker vibe, than a destination restaurant with iconic food. 

i had the bün which was ok, but light in the meat portions. spirng rolls were awesome though - packed with lots of chicken. they do vege protein shakes too with fresh ingredients mixed in front of you. 

hopefully they can up their game in the portion sizes, originality of offerings, and a broader range of menu items. right now, it may be too soon to tell."}
{"text":"This opened not too long ago (less than a month) and I was super excited to try it (King West does not have a lot of great Asian food options, except maybe CoCo Rice). I went in for lunch and it's canteen style so you order and pay first before sitting down.

I ordered a small bowl of pho with a side of pork fresh rolls. I like that their spring rolls and fresh rolls menu offer a lot of variety. Shrimp fresh rolls are more common but I prefer pork so glad that was an option. There are also vegetarian options as well. Overall, the food was OK. Soup is good, a little on the saltier side. Could use more meat. Pork is somewhat dry and flavourless in the roll but the sauce it comes with can help with that. Doesn't compare to the pho places on Spadina or Ossington, but if you're in the area and craving some comfort food it's not a bad choice. Total came out to just under $13.

One interesting thing about this place is that they offer protein shakes. You can even get a full size container of Vega protein powder. I would come back to explore their smoothies and dessert menu. 

Overall, it was okay. I'll come back if I'm craving pho and am in the area. Can see this being good for takeout too. So far it's a good spot for lunch hour since it's not too crowded (yet)."}
{"text":"original viet food bar with only a small dozens of items on the menu and some nice sin to milkshakes options. i had the rolls and chicken bo bun so cannot tell about the pho. food is ok and service is friendly. price is as already stated by others higher than the regular viet restaurant."}
{"text":"I love my Vietnamese food and this is definitely one of the worst places I've tried. Dry and bland pho, barely any beef in the soup, not a lot of garnishing (see photo). Spring rolls were gross.. they put yam and taro in it. Blech. NOT GOOD. Vermicelli was also tasteless and no flavour at all. Pork that came with it was dry. They topped it off with watered down lettuce and cucumber. To top it off, we waited about 20 minutes for our food.. the restaurant wasn't busy either. Don't come here if you want decent/good Vietnamese food, walk to Spadina!!"}
{"text":"Been eating Viet food religiously the last fifteen years.  This is the best Vietnamese in Toronto, full stop.  Meat is fresh and not chemically tenderized like a lot of the other spots in the city.  Moreover, everyone who works there is super friendly."}
{"text":"I had walked by this place a few times before noticing that King West now had a Vietnamese place, and was excited to check it out!

It was pleasing to see Bun Rieu (one of my faves) on the menu - ordered that and some shrimp rolls. One touch I really like is the self-serve water cooler - with both lemons and limes!

The rolls and soup came out quickly, presentation was nice, and portions were generous.

I was really surprised by the rolls - the veggies/herbs in them were super-fresh and crunchy, but what put them over the top for me were the bean sprouts inside, the added texture was very enjoyable!

The savory flavor of the soup was bolstered by super-fresh tomatoes and herbs, and was surprisingly (and enjoyably) light compared to other places I've tried it.

Had a nice chat with one of the staff before departing - she recommended the 'Homestyle' roll, which I'll definitely be returning to sample!

A welcome addition to the restaurants in the area, pop in and check it out!"}
{"text":"Despite the higher prices, this used to be our go-to place for a quick Viet fix. After tonight's dinner, we're reconsidering... We haven't gone there for a couple of months. Something definitely changed...for the worse.

The takeout tonight was simply disappointing. We had the rice with extra meat. The rice looked old and rough. The meat was overcooked and chewy. We also had the bun with pork slices. The rice noodles were uncooked hence hard to chew on. The spring roll seemed like it was reheated. Overall just very underwhelming...  

The only redeeming thing... Staff are still very friendly  hence the 2 stars...."}
