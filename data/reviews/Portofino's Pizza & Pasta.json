{"text":"Ive lived in Ingram for 2 years. Ive ordered Portofinos once a week for my family on average. Food is decent and location was close to home. BUT today I can guarantee I will never spend another dime there again! The customer service at this joint is horrible. I needed to correct an order I placed online. The man on the phone literally screamed at me over the price difference... Not a problem (if you're going to treat me like this) just cancel my order. He tells me that I would need to call the credit card company to stop the payment... who says that?? Not trying to be this big of a hassle, I say just deliver the food as is without my corrections. He starts laughing at me, hollars to someone else behinds the scenes, come back to the phone and tells me we will give you what you want this time, but never again! I should say, all this was over the fact that I wanted cheddar cheese on my hoagie instead of provolone, I just forgot to change the cheese type before I submitted payment online...! Ive ordered this same sandwich for 2 years!  Really Portofinos... ? Adios"}
{"text":"I gave 1 star only because I had to give a star.  Their chicken salad was horrible.  Almost 50% of it was lettuce hearts.  What a waste of money.  If you're going to serve salads have the decency to actually serve me edible lettuce."}
{"text":"We'v been ordering from portifinos for over 5 yrs & never been disappointed! !  Definitely our favorite in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food is good just wasn't happy that it took over an hour for us to not even get our delivery."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time last night. Perfect! The wedgies (we got buffalo chicken and four cheese) were the best we've ever had. Delivery was fast on a Saturday night. Prices were reasonable. We'll be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! They don't inventory what they say they do! You order online they call back to read you what you can have and can't have! Then they hold your funds and give you the run around which might I add is a major violation with their merchant services agreement! I guess they are in need of my 23 bucks more than I am! Well congrats you just bought yourself a 1 star rating for cheating customers! Shame on you! Their customer service is as tasteless as their dough!"}
{"text":"I love wings. Its one of the few foods I could eat daily and never get tired of them. Ordered a dozen garlic hot wings and fries the other day. The dude came fast and the wings and fries were piled into one Styrofoam container. The wings were dumped on top of the fries, coating them in the sauce. The wings weren't cooked all the way and I had to throw them in the oven for 20-30 minutes to cook fully. The sauce tasted good and, one fully cooked, the wings were alright. They lost brownie points for coating my fries in the sauce. Not sure why they couldn't have put them in separate containers or at least put the fries on top of the wings."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The delivery guy was especially nice. The wings are great, better than a lot of places in the Brentwood area that I've had. The hot sausage hoagie was good but not the best, sort of lacking meat in my opinion. The pepperoni rolls are great! They are bigger and less expensive than Vocelli's which is a plus! They have a large menu and great prices, it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Not only did it take them 2 hours to deliver my first order, but they forgot my breadsticks. When I called, they said they would deliver them quickly. We never got them. We paid for low quality food and something we didn't even get. Save the time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just got delivery from here . They said in advance
It was going to take 45 minutes and it got here around then . All I wanted was fettucine Alfredo plain without any chicken or seafood. Came to $9 and some change and it was a huge portion. You can tell its homemade. Creamy, thick, buttery, Alfredo-y. I loved it. The next time I crave Alfredo I will definitely call these people again (even though they aren't the friendliest on the phone)"}
{"text":"I wrote last week saying my stepdaughter ordered a pizza for us and it cost her $14.00 plus tip.  We had found a new great pizza place  - We ordered again tonight and I received a hard time from the driver saying that it was to far and that they would now require a $20 minimum order to deliver to our home.  We are less than a mile from my stepdaughter - THEY JUST LOST OUR BUSINESS."}
{"text":"When we called to order, the guy on the line said this was one of the best places in the burgh and that we wouldn't be disappointed. Well, we were. They got our order wrong and our food arrived luke warm.  With all the variety of pizza joints in the area, you're better off ordering elsewhere."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area last and wanted to find a pizza place to go to. These guys throw ads into just about every penny saver so we had about seven just lying around.  We went ahead and ordered for pickup.  They quoted a half hour (sorta long but whatever). I show up and the pizza took another 15 minutes on top of that.  I got the pizza home and was met with pretty mediocre pizza.  It was edible, but any of the standard chain stores have better pies than this.  And cheaper.  And nicer employees. And faster service.  Jonesing for disappointment, we decided to order a calzone a few weeks later just to make sure we disliked all their food (it was the closest place around...).  The calzone was literally a pre made pizza dough folded in half. There were not enough toppings included to justify the price and the taste was simply eh.  In short, they are not good at pizza or calzones.  You would be better served heading to a place that puts actual passion into their food.  They get 2 stars from me simply because I did not get sick from their food."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here.  great taste for a low price.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love love love portofinos!!! The boss is extremely cruel to his staff though.... don't tip the pizza guys or anything if you pick up, because the boss keeps all the tips!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from this place a few times now and I think it is growing to be my favorite delivery pizza parlor in the south hills area. Chewy crisp crust, sweet sauce, and good prices. My favorite is the mushroom and onion combination! Will pretty much be our go to place for delivery!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a pepperoni and bacon pizza...it was a greasy mess.  After a slice I just pitched the entire thing.   I just wasted about  $20.  It was gross and I now feel I'll.  I have had this combo from other places...this place...they ruined it...i opened the box and it just looked gross."}
{"text":"I've been ordering Portofino's for over a year, the food was great six months ago...but over the past few months the hoagies in particular have been super skimpy. The italian hoagie I received had less than a slice of meat on it and full of lettuce and onion - I returned it. Same with the meatballs hoagie, one meatball spread across the half hoagie - returned it. Now the wedgies - ordered the steak wedgie last night - could not find a piece of steak on it - I dug under the mounds of lettuce and onion and tomato - there might have been a Steak-um somewhere melted into the crust - can't be sure - done returning things. I'll stick to the wings and pizza if I decide to order again - they have always been good. Disappointed time and again. Hoping they get their act together soon."}
{"text":"My fave pizza in Pittsburgh. 

I always order the Cheese Pizza add Cheddar Cheese. Sounds so simple, but it's heaven in every bite!

I would have given them five stars instead of four but you usually have to argue with the manager for him to fix a mistake.  Although he often fixes it hate having to argue for someone to make something right."}
{"text":"I placed an online order with this restaurant. Their online system does not work and they are incompetent at using it resulting in virtually inedible food.

The online system confirmed the order for pickup but not the time. It indicated that the status would be updated when ready (or when some status was known). I checked the system regularly and saw no update.

They eventually called to tell me that my order had been ready for some time--20 minutes for pickup they said, as if their own ordering system did not indicate a completely open-ended order-ready time. There was never an indication my order was ready or when it would be.

Had I not paid in advance I almost certainly wouldn't have accepted this food in this condition: the food was cold and stale. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This pizza place has been part of our community as long as I can remember. We have a favorite pizza place that we go to but we decided to break out of our shell and try this place. I stopped in and ordered a pizza to go. The guy who waited on me was very nice. I ordered their signature pizza \"The Portofino's\". It has lots of veggies (tomatoes, onions, green peppers, black olives) and some meat on it. It had a nice portion of cheese that was gooey and stringy. The crust was baked perfectly. The sauce was tomato-y but not too sweet. We really enjoyed it and will put it on our list of places to order from."}
{"text":"8 guys just standing around behind the counter, no one seems to know what they're doing. One of them quotes a price higher than their advertised special, refuses to honor their own flyer, then actually yells at me when I won't pay the higher price. So much for customer service. There are lots of great pizza shops in Pittsburgh - don't waste your time with this joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Note-They have 3 locations according to their ad in the Pennysaver.

Note 2-They listed a website, but it appears to be down as I write this. 

My test for any pizza parlor: A mush 'n' pep pizza, garlic wings, and an Italian hoagie. If they can do those well, then imo you have a pretty good pie joint. 

And they passed. Professor Darren  (graduated Magna Cum Laude from the School of Hard Knocks)  would give 'em a solid B if this dinner was a dissertation. 

Yeah, those garlic parm wings were probably the most tender I have ever tasted. They came swimming in juices (oil? butter?) and loaded with parmesan. 

Did they fry these or cook them low 'n' slow for 12 hours? Seriously.

How many different ways can one say \"falling off the bone\" when it comes to meat?  

No complaints, so surprises when it comes to the Italian hoagie and pizza. The hoagie was one of those \"loaf of bread\" types, which always pleases me. They weren't stingy with the meat either, and the veggies were fresh and crisp. 

The pizza was a typical doughy, puffy Pittsburgh pie, generous in terms of sauce and cheese. Like I've said before, Pittsburghers each like their pizza a different way. I belong the the Universalist Church of Pizza. They are all God's errr...pizzas to me. Except for Beto's...and...ulp...Vincents. Shhhhh...

The delivery was fast too. No phone calls from lost drivers either. They deliver to Brentwood, Whitehall, Carrick, Overbrook, Brookline (that's us!), Castle Shannon, and Baldwin. Whew! Does Santa Claus deliver for them during the offseason? Who else covers that much ground? Jeez. 


Portofino's is a worthy entrant into the pizza wars. Try 'em."}
{"text":"Decided to order for the first time tonight.. Everything was great! My tossed salad was very fresh and nice portion the French dressing was great and the pizza was still hot and sooo good!!! They delivered pretty quickly and the man was nice on the phone.. Will be ordering again !"}
