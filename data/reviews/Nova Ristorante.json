{"text":"I was very surprised but this restaurant, considering the mall it was in, but was very pleased with the warm and welcoming interior and atmosphere. The food was fairly good value considering this restaurant is a division of Pizza Nova. I had the Pasta A La A Vodka with optional chicken breast. The chicken breast was slightly over grilled although the pasta and sauce were very good. Overall, I would recommend this if you're in the mood for Italian."}
{"text":"This is not just a pizza joint. Who knew there was this little gem of a restaurant in the middle of Scarborough? It truly is fine dining at a very reasonable price. The quality of food is excellent and the quantity is honestly enough to satisfy anyone's large appetite.   The first time I came, a few months ago I was blown away at the quality of food we had. We ordered the grilled squid for an appetizer and it was definitely the best I've ever had. The Fettuccine Alfredo  was perfect and seriously enough for two. The fresh bread was soft and delicious. The meal was so good, I had to come back.   I brought my parents here for a birthday dinner last night and we had to have the grilled squid - just as delish as last time!    I had the veal piccata which was absolutely delicious and beautifully plated. My parents both ordered the Lobster Gnocchi which was amazingly rich and flavorful. We had so much that we had to pack up food to take home.   This place is definitely date worthy. The interior is nicely done and the food is epic. If you are looking for a high quality meal indicative of downtown restaurants, I highly recommend this \"Pizza Nova\" restaurant. It truly is much more than just pizza!! Don't be fooled by the name.   I don't normally write reviews, I'm more of a lurker, but it just had to let people know about this place."}
{"text":"The family went out for dinner last week and we all decided to have a Caesar salad which was pretty good. My husband had a pizza that he loved and my daughters had a pasta dish . One had a white sauce and the other had a red sauce, they were both a little disappointed with the flavour of their pasta. I myself had a burger, although the French fries we're like McCain frozen fries the burger itself was absolutely delicious it was juicy and the flavour was perfect."}
{"text":"There have been few places I have tried grilled calamari and this place just does it right. Grilled calamari stuffed with garlic,  parmesan and parsley on a bed of roasted leeks and crrots- it was absolutely amazing especially with bread, the veggies were seasoned well. I would have preferred the calamari to been seared a little though.  For main, I had the handmade ravioli with beef, the sauce had so much flavor and the beef was perfect, not mushy at all.    My friend ordered the Tuscan pizza without the chicken, we know spinach and feta go together. We paid $16 for a small pizza which in my opinion isn't worth it so I wouldn't order it next time.  For desert I ordered the chocolate royal cake- layer of white chocolate mousse, milk chocolate mousse and devils cake. It was pretty amazing especially a great choice if someone really loves chocolate. The tiramisu could use some alterations...too much cocoa powder had us gulping our water and the masrapone cheese could have been made a little creamy.    The waitress was funny and witty, great energy and ambiance. Overall this was a great dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Very consistent. Very friendly staff. A gem in an otherwise desolate area for restaurant choices. Great chicken parm and pasta dishes. Careful attention to detail. Family favourite."}
{"text":"ok this is an old review, was there last in 2007 with my kids for lunch, but we used to frequent this place (when it was good) in the early 90's after my stints at Kennedy Banquet hall working the Bingo unit in the evenings..mondays and wednesdays made $20 bucks a night for charity..would go here after the smokey filled hall  It was soo good back then maybe being 20 something was the difference and we had a tonne of jugs.  When I went with the kids for lunch we had ceasar salad and a large pizza, it taste just like the delivery or take out nothing better, actually the people who own it seem to be a bit over the whole experience.  So if you need Pizza Nova just have delivery without the attidude you will get the same thing."}
{"text":"Traveling from Northern California was looking for good simple Italian food. Yelp comes through again. Great service and friendly staff. Seems a lot of local repeat customers greeted by name with traditional Italian hugs and greetings. Nice menus including seasonal specialties. I enjoyed a nice Veal Scaloppini and Salad with an Espresso to top it off. Looking for a nice Italian meal? I highly recommend Nova.   I will be back next time in town!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday with my mother and was pleasantly surprised. The decor was warm and inviting, while the server was very friendly.   My mother enjoyed her latte and I liked my Caesar. Just a bit spicy but with a definite alcohol kick to it!   We ordered a daily special baked tuna item as well as lamb chops. The lamp chops were juicy and cooked perfectly medium rare, not tough at all. It was nestled atop a massive bed of mashed potatoes, which were buttery and delicious but I do wish there was some sort of gravy to go with them. There were also some carrots. Always important to get my vegetables in!  Though we originally thought the server told us the special was a tuna steak, when it came it was more like a creamy risotto with mushrooms, nuts, and pieces of tuna. We were originally a bit disappointed because we hadn't listened properly to the server (though apparently, the server thought it was a tuna steak as well) but it ended up being very good. The risotto was al dente and the textural variation with the crunchy nuts, springy mushrooms and meaty tuna.  For dessert, I ordered a tiramisu and to our surprise, the server came out with a chocolate cake that my mother found delicious. It was quite sweet, but very rich in chocolate flavour.   The tiramisu had a distinct coffee taste and had just the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"First time trying this Restuarant and truth be told I loved it. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and given a table. The decor is that of a fine dining establishment without the exuberant prices My server Janice was a pleasure to deal with her service is second to none. I ordered the speciality pizza and it was delicious somewhat what you would get downtown in little Italy. I will definitely be back.Thank you Janice for a great dining experience"}
{"text":"This is an average Italian restaurant. The wait for the food actually took quite long. I enjoyed my dish which was the Basilicata. The service was also good, this place just didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"The new spin on this restaurant has done wonders. Great atmosphere and great food. I like the effort made to prepare dishes fresh in the spot."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant extension of Pizza Nova offering a wider variety of dishes in a sit down setting. The food is pretty much Pizza Nova food, but in a restaurant setting. They do have some additional menu offerings, such as risotto, pastas, soups, and they even take a swing at cioppino. Compare to the regular Pizza Nova offerings, this is definitely a step up. They put some effort into trying to recreate higher end dishes at more modest prices. But in the end, this is still Pizza nova, so the food does not compare to any of the multitude of Italian restaurants in Toronto. We had the minestrone, which was made in store but tasted surprisingly similar to Campbells canned soup. The cioppino is made with all frozen seafood so the flavour and texture are all lacking. The seasonal chestnut risotto was so sweet it could have been served as a dessert. If you think Pizza Nova makes great pizza, then you will probably like this place. If you know what real Italian food is like, then go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It been a few years since I went to the original sight of Pizza Nova. It was always a nice place to get a wonderful pizza. I was pleasantly surprised to find the location had been renovated. It's a bright and welcoming location and still service.   The menu has been expanded and my meal was fantastic."}
{"text":"Located in a somewhat lack luster stretch of shops and restaurants, Nova Ristorante is likely the joint to have the cleanest and highest quality.  That really doesn't say much, however, because it's being compared to the run-down takeout shops next to it.   My party ordered a variety of pasta dishes: - Tuscan Pesto - Basilicata - Ravioli Rose - Duck Bolognese  All were reasonably priced - that is, until we acknowledged the small portion size and the congruent flavour among all the dishes that screamed that it tasted like something pre-packaged and ''out of the box''.    You also get a plate of small dinner rolls for free to start your meal.  This is always appreciated to help one stave off their hunger, but be prepared to have whipped butter packages instead of whipped butter in a dish. This isn't usual, but it does enhance the fact that the restaurant is not high end and instead just a pleasant spot for lunch/dinner.   My server, the awesome lady with pink hair, provided impeccable customer service though. She was prompt, engaging and checked up on us regularly. Kudos to her for bringing her positive energy to the table!  Overall, if you're in the area, hit Nova up for lunch because its decor, service, and prices are still above what you may find elsewhere in the vicinity."}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving aimlessly for dinner. It was a toss between African cuisine vs. Italian. We spotted this restaurant as we drove by.  Apparently, this is the location where Pizza Nova all began. I've ordered the Salmon for the main, it was a thick cut of salmon and the garlic went well with it.   Shrimp Fra Diavolo Sautéed jumbo shrimp in your choice of spicy tomato garlic sauce or mild garlic butter. 14 The shrimp were butterfly but tasted very bitter, I am not sure if there were too much wine added or what happened to it. I didn't enjoy it.  The service was very pleasant, the waitress was helpful when we asked for suggestions which made the dining experience more relaxed. Overall not bad.."}
{"text":"Used to be good.  We went on a regular basis way back, and really liked this place, thr Chicken Parmesan was incredible.  But after a long absence we returned, only to find the Chicken Parmesan was now $17.00 each, no longer a double breast, there were no longer any leftovers.  The whole menu is now pretty much the same as Pizza Nova's (which is not a surprise, as they always shared a kitchen, but the restaurant always seemed to have their own menu.   Sad too, that it took more than thirty minutes for our food to come. I was expecting more from the new higher prices."}
{"text":"This place is Pizza Nova.  Not hidden beside Pizza Nova as some people think! I have been eating here a couple of times a year since my youth, many many years ago.  I have always liked the pizza here but now I am older I enjoy the new menu.  The client hasn't changed much though.  Still local Scarberians wearing sweatpants, lol."}
{"text":"My only choice for late night pizza, the place is always busy and the pizza is always fresh, well except the slices (only sometimes)  The manager also seems to have a very specific hiring policy when it comes to the cashiers."}
{"text":"Interesting to see Pizza Nova opening a restaurant to serve other Italian food.  (Pizza Nova was right next door!)  Our waitress was friendly but the restaurant seemed short-staffed. It wasn't busy on a Tuesday night. The appetizer came quickly but the waitress forgot our bread.  Our orders also took some time to be ready, so we were really hungry.  When the food came, we were all disappointed about the portions. The pasta was good, but just not enough, even for my friend who has the smallest appetite."}
{"text":"Delicious food great service. Garlic bread and Ravioli is delicious definitely ask for it with extra cheese baked on top it's mouth watering"}
{"text":"I had like the best pizza from pizza nova last night. We had a pineapple and chicken type pizza. It was sooo gooood! The pizza was hot and fresh and I tried the dipping  sauce jalapeno ranch.  So good. Whatever happened to my diet I do not know!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a quiet strip mall not far from the Lawrence subway station. You will probably see the Pizza Nova sign before spotting this place right next to it. Simple italian fair in a bright and airy space. You can of course get pizza (really? Pizza Nova is right next door), but there are pastas, sandwiches and main meals to choose from.   I got the veal sandwich with Mediterranean salad. Both were delicious and the portion size was enough for a dinner portion. Appreciated the good sauce to meat to bread ratio. Salad was fresh with plenty of olives!! Also, our server was really friendly and made sure we never needed anything. A solid dinner spot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple of years now and have always had good service. And their pizzas are the best I've tasted compared to pizza pizza and pizza hut well except for mine that is. lol"}
{"text":"Nice service. Standard food thou. I tried the meat lover pizza, lamb chop, mussels and risotto. I only love the mussels because the sauce is amazing. However the rest is meh especially the lamb chop is lack of taste."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this Pizza Nova last week with a colleague.  That last two times I was there (in the same week!) I'd ordered Pasta Al Forno and loved it!  So that's what I ordered this time.  It wasn't as awesome as in the past.  The pasta sauce was really thick and kind of bland.  I ate some of the pasta and ended up eating the cheese off the top.  The bread was delicious.  Our server was very friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"This was my favourite spot. I ate here weekly. New owners took over Andy first experience was terrible! Waited years to try again. Went a few months ago had an amazing experience. The bread with oil and spices served warm was delicious! My Greek salad with chicken was beautiful vegetables where crisp! It was amazing!! Went a few days ago and ordered the same thing. Again they changed their menu constantly so when you love something you go back and can't get it aka the bread. Then I get my Greek salad and the lettuce is wilted and it just looks soggy and was. Total disappointment again!! Then the Cesar salad dressing was changed to crappy Kraft instead of Renee's and you don't even get a lemon wedge!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is slightly hidden away beside Pizza Nova. It has a nice menu with many Italian options. They make their own pasta in house which is nice.   I chose a vegetarian pasta. It had a nice sauce and a good amount of veggies. Overall I thought it was pretty good. I've had amazing pasta on a recent trip to Paris so compared to that, it wasn't the greatest.   Service was really good. They also were very accommodating for allergies.   The interior was nice. It's actually quite spacious inside, although it doesn't seem very big from the outside. It's pretty casual as well. Not very full for a weekday night either.   I do think prices were slightly too high for the quality but otherwise pretty reasonable.   I'd want to come back to try some of their other foods."}
{"text":"Super impressed with this place!   Ignore the fact that this restaurant is located in a somewhat dingy mall, because the food here is fantastic. The executive chef here prides himself with using only the freshest local ingredients and puts in a personal twist with traditional Italian recipes, and it shows. I got a chance last night to try their new Spring menu:  1. San Marino salad: Roasted asparagus, cherry tomatoes and romaine lettuce - A good starter  2. The Tuscan Spring: Zucchini noodles, cherry tomatoes, shrimp, garlic and olive oil - Absolutely loved the zucchini noodles. I think this will be a big hit with the low-carb crowd.  3. Amalfi: Spring lemon risotto with asparagus in a light cream sauce and black sesame - this was very yummy. Love the light crunchiness of the black sesame and the light lemon cream sauce was perfect with it.  4. Adriatic: Grilled veal chop with mashed parsnips and beets - they did a great job with the chop and it was tender and juicy. The sweet parsnip mash was great!  5. Sicilian Kiss: Home-made light orange mousse in a real orange shell - This dessert looks very pretty but personally I am not a fan of citrus peel, so it was just ok for me.  We also tried items that were part of their regular menu:  6. Calamari Nova - I was very pleased that the calamari was fried perfectly (not chewy), and the breading was light. Yum!  7. Wild boar chop with roasted kale and turnip wedge - this was my favourite item of the night. The chop was very flavourful and tender. The roasted kale was a nice touch and it has almost a chip-like texture to it. Personally I would have like the kale cooked soft, but it was good nonetheless.  8. Shrimp Fra Diavolo: Sauteed jumbo shrimp with a touch of Italian chilli pepper and garlic. Yum!  9. Tiramisu - Very creamy and amazing! Yum!  I was told that the restaurant started the whole fastfood Pizza Nova chain, but I am not sure why other reviewers would compare this to Pizza Nova since the food there is not even in the same league.   The prices for what you get here is extremely reasonable (Premium items such as steak or boar chop are under $25), and it is possible to have a great affordable meal here.  Overall, I loved my experience here at Nova Ristorante and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since long before YELP days, so I'm happy to finally write how I feel about Nova.   They have really good food, the Pizza's r very good and the sauce.... Tastes so much better than all the Pizza Nova's.   Clean and spacious restaurant with plenty of parking and friendly staff. Especially the cute waitress with the PINK HAIR... Omg we LOVE HER and she's worked there for a long time but is as bubbly as if it's her 1st day!!  Only 1 complaint - and that is the HORRIBLE fountain Coke.  It tastes off, like it's not mixed properly or the lines need to be cleaned. Be sure to get a can of coke instead.  1 small complaint, but the pizza and service make up for ruining my beloved Coke. Hmm no Coke emoji   I recommend this place to anyone looking for a more traditional Italian flavored pizza without driving to Woodbridge / Maple. MEHHH who needs Woodbridge we have NOVA . No Italian hand-gesture emojis either! Ayyyy ohhhh I hope the i8 has better smileys"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with amazing food to spend some nice time with your loved ones! I wish heartfelt success to the restaurant and to the great team!"}
