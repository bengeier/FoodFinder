{"text":"Geier's Grill, the restaurant inside Holiday Inn Madison at The American Center, was a not expected surprise. Usually such hotel restaurants are at best so-so, but was most definitely not the case here. We visited about 4:30 Friday (had a coupon, thought we'd try this close-to-home place we'd never heard of), & were the only people there. First off, this place is EXTREMELY clean looking (in this age of food borne illnesses, this is a biggie for us; BTW, we did see the cook/ chef walk thru the bar area, & his uniform was very clean). The very friendly bartender/ attentive server, Merick, quickly brought us menus & a mixed basket of spicily seasoned popcorn, almonds, peanuts, pretzels & other crunchy things. The not huge menu had a selection of 10 appetizers & salads, 7 sandwiches & burgers, & 6 entrees (each came w/2 sides). My wife had the Monterey Jack chicken ($11.50) - perfectly done - w/cheese, bacon & tomatoes; sides of roasted pesto potatoes & a large portion of broccoli were fresh (not frozen) & perfectly done & seasoned. I had the fish & chips ($14) - 3 good sized pieces of beer battered deep fried cod that came w/a bowl of fresh, crisp coleslaw & a separate whole plate of in-house made thick cut browned & crispy potato chips w/a somewhat spicy seasoning (probably the best I've ever eaten anywhere). As my sides, I also had the broccoli & crispy (as I'd ordered) French fries, a pretty big pile. There was so much food we had to take some home, so there was no room for desert. We will definitely visit Geier's Grill again - some of the best restaurant food we've had in a while."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple times due to its proximity to hotel however, each time the food was less than desirable. No thanks."}
{"text":"So I am a local person who went to a hotel restaurant for dinner.  Ever hear of that?  It's unheard from since hotel restaurants can charge more knowing their guests without transportation are probably stuck eating there.  We felt their prices were well in line with any \"normal\" restaurant.

We just got our 2016-17 Bucky Book and we're on a mission to get the most value out of it for the next year and made Geier's Grill our first stop on this journey.

They did a good job for us.  We were the only ones in the restaurant which likely contributed to our top notch service.  They gave us a complimentary popcorn/pretzel mix with a salty spice that was yummy on an empty stomach.  I got salmon for dinner that came with two sides.  I chose the fries and broccoli.  Hubby had a chicken pasta entree with pesto fried potatoes as his side.

Both meals were hot and delicious.  There were no issues with our coupon so it ended up being very reasonably priced for us.  On our way out, we each snagged a cup of their complimentary lobby coffee which was piping hot.

Overall, a pretty good choice for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet is a great deal for $10 and comes with oj, coffee, eggs, muffins, toast, meat, and your other continental dishes.  Today, they had potatoes and French toast sticks too. Service is friendly but exceedingly slow. You can also order off the menu and the skillet sensation was good, albeit a bit greasy. Portions for breakfast are generous. Now dinner portions are definitely pretty skimpy.  I tried the tauscher's chicken, which is one of the signature dishes.  It is a blend of ice, black beans, chicken, feta, spinach, and peppers.  It came with a beef stew, which was very good.  The dish itself was flavorful and very comfort food-like. It was small but rang in at only $10.50. Also tried the pizza, which is on par with domino's. Decent but not spectacular. $12 for a 14\" 1-topping.  If you are staying at the holiday inn, they offer room service or dining service. The restaurant itself is pretty nice and the seating is comfortable with a bar and plenty of tv's."}
{"text":"4 star service, 2 star 'bar food', and 3 star breakfast.

Located in the Holiday Inn American Center.  Got in late on a Sunday night, and decided to grab a bite to eat as the bar serves food until 11PM.  First off, the bartender was great.  Personable, funny, and treated us right.  He was acting as server and bartender and always brought everything to the table which was nice.  Split some wings to start and had a burger and fries to eat.  Wings were adequate, but pretty small and nothing memorable.  Burger and fries we again passable, but not great.  They did have a good selection of local micros, so it was all washed down with an Edmund Fitzgerald Porter from Great Lakes Brewing, tasty!!

We were back again for the breakfast buffet.  Breakfast was way better than dinner the night before.  Pretty typical hotel buffet, with eggs, French toast, fruit, yogurt, bagels, toast, coffee, OJ, you get the picture.  It was kept well stocked and the wait staff was pretty quick with refills.

So a bit of a mixed bag, but alright for a hotel if you don't want to or don't have time to venture out for better food."}
