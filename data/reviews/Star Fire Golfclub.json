{"text":"Incredible service, amenable to changing any menu item to vegan or vegetarian. Absolutely stellar service. Food excellent !!!  Can't stress this strong enough!!!"}
{"text":"I golf here once a year.  I like that it's a city course that I would describe as tight.  You'll find homes all along the course and enough to make it a good challenge.  The price is right for what you get."}
{"text":"First off, I  not a golfer but I was on spring break here in Scottsdale and my family was looking for a unique bonding experience.   At $59 a round this seemed like a decent value.  The service as top notch, the course was well manicured and the pace of play was just right.  A great way to spend an afternoon with your family!   Ps the western cheeseburger at the grill hit the spot for lunch!"}
