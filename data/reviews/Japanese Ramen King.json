{"text":"The food was excellent and the service friendly! Definitely check it out!! I need up getting the Butter Miso Ramen, chicken karaage, and takoyaki; all quite delicious :)"}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place on a Tuesday for lunch with the BF. My first thought was that this place was so small. There were only about 6 tables and some seats at the bar. But we were here after 1:30 pm, so the place wasn't full, and it didn't feel cramped.

BF was immediately interested in trying the Jigoku (Hell) Ramen Level 3 ($10.95). I didn't know what I wanted since the menu was at good 10 pgs long. (And the more choices you give me the more indecisive i get.) The waitress (she might have been the manager as well) came over twice and when I still couldn't decide, she asked if I needed any recommendations. Even better! Now I didn't have to decide. She recommended to me the daily lunch special, which was a fish ramen in ginger broth ($7.99). Ok!

My fish ramen had so much ingredients in it. The bowl didn't look too massive, but I was stuffed by the end. It had 3 kinds of fish, tofu cubes, bean sprouts, green onion, cucumber, and sesame seeds. The broth was very light and the ginger flavour was subtle. I didn't feel thirsty after finishing my ramen, even though I drank a lot of the broth. Which was a good thing. The BF was a big fan of the ginger broth.

The hell ramen level 3 had cha siu, half an egg, black fungus, bamboo shoots, green onion, and sesame seeds. I tried a bit of the broth, and the spiciness really hits you afterwards. So you can taste the broth and get the kick afterwards. The waitress came by to check to see if the level 3 spiciness was too spicy for the BF. When the BF said it was ok for him, she informed him there was actually a secret level 4 spiciness that she only recommends to people who can handle level 3. For $1 more you can get a super spicy paste that the chief makes himself to add to the level 3 broth. The BF said he might try it next time.   

Service was good. The waitress came by a few times to check on us. She was very nice and chatty, to the point the BF wasn't used to it. She was also really good at promoting the place. She asked us if this was our first time here, and we said yes. She told us there was a $6.99-$7.99 special for lunch everyday that is not advertised. You have to ask them about it. She also told us the chef had over 20 years of experience, there was a lot of things he knew how to make. So if there was anything we wanted to eat that wasn't on the menu, they might be able to make it for us as well. 

I think the price was good for the portions you get. Especially the daily lunch special. So I think I will definitely be back again to try different things."}
{"text":"We tried the Hakata and the soft bone ramen and it was superb. It's not your ordinary ramen place. If you're craving for authentic ramen after shopping at Pacific Mall-- this is the go-to place. There are at least 10 different ramen to choose from and they also serve sushi. The service is excellent. Our server was attentive and friendly. You also have the option to customize your ramen like additional toppings. The place is small but cozy. We'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my regular go to for sushi and ramen. Like always my rating will be according to service, atmosphere and food.

Service: 5/5 - the server was super nice and accomadating. I loved how all the staff were knowledgeable. All the staff always had a smile on their face and accomadated to all our needs.

Atmosphere 4/5 - i love all the decoratings and how the place looks. The ambience is relaxing, but one thing I am not a big fan of are the chairs. I am super short so it is hard for me to get on stool chairs n my legs get tired from dangling all the time, but staff was accomadating and turned over the basket for me to step on, which was super nice and helpful. 

Food 5/5 - i love love love their deluxe sushi platter. The quality of fish was super fresh. Also the Uni in my opinion is mouth watering. It does cost $10 for two piece of sushi, but boy is it worth it. I sometime just go in for one order of Uni sushi if I am craving it. The ramen in my opinion is alright, but their was one that was delicious. They torched the pork belly and even the soup had the torch flavour. Drools! Oh yea their fried chicken leg bone in taste so amazing!

Since I've been here so many times I just pooled all the pictures together and stuff.

All in all I give JRK 4.5 stars. I have been there at least 5 times and the deluxe sushi and uni is what i go back for. LOVE!!! keep up the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ramen broth lacked flavor. Not enough pork.  My husband and I went away hungry.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The Ramen is awesome always ordered; as an addition to our order we tried some sushi and it was amazing!  (Lobster)  It was beautiful to look and totally delicious!!"}
{"text":"Ramen was very plain. Sushi seeweed wrap was saggy. Chairs are uncomfortable. The server was loud & rude.

The best of all is the sashimi, was quite fresh.

Definitely won't come back again."}
{"text":"So I returned! And they held up their good food standard and awesome service! I this time I ordered the butter miso ramen: it was amazing. All the components shone through in the broth, the pork, the miso, the butter, the negi, the roasted garlic, and the secret ingredient: the pungent bamboo shoots adding a very distinct aroma to each spoonful of soup. Delish! But what made the five star drop to a four? Well it's quite simple: I ordered a 12 piece Assorted sushi - on the menu it is depicted as 12 pieces of nigiri - what arrived at the table was six nigiri and a roll cut into 6 pieces. It was a bit deflating and it seemed lazy. It was really 6 assorted pieces and a sushi roll. What can I say? How assorted can six pieces from the same roll be? We were a table for two, if they could have given us two of each of the assortment of six we were served it would have been more balanced. Now I'm left wondering how the tuna, tako, and mackerel were."}
{"text":"When a sudden urge for Ramen came upon my wife and I, we relied on a simple Yelp search to find the best Ramen in our area. What a perfect pick!

The space is very charming and well decorated and we were greeted with enthusiasm. The hostess/waitress was eager to help us navigate the menu selections and specials and such a genuinely nice person. 

My wife went out on a limb (for her) and ordered the soft bone pork ramen which contained stewed pork ribs to the point where the bone was soft and edible. I ordered the spicy red miso with pork belly ramen. Both of us could not have been happier with the flavours that were presented in front of us just moments later. 

We had the best experience both in service and food. 4 thumbs up from the two of us!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Clean Restaurant. Most important of all, caters to vegetarian needs! Let them know you're vegetarian and they'll take care of the rest.
Probably one of, if not the best, ramen place in the GTA. Must try"}
{"text":"this is the worst place for Ramen in Toronto in the history of Ramen. If you like over-priced, instant noodle based, non-authentic Japanese Ramen then come here to waste your $13.99 on a lightly filled bowl of \"ramen\". Small portion, bad ramen."}
{"text":"I had the ramen with salmon hand roll special for $11.99 and was extremely satisfied. 
The ramen noodles was good, the pork was very tender, not fatty as well and the egg was cooked to perfection! 
The salmon on the roll was fresh, it was sooooo good that I wanted more.
Overall, food -great, service -excellent, parking -awesome, ambiance -"}
{"text":"+0.5. JRK is one of the few places where their soup is not overwhelmed with MSG and I don't go home after feeling I need to down litres of water.  

I love ordering their special items. There's usually something new or different from their Facebook page or their menu on the wall. When I went today, they had a special Toro and uni don, see picture. What I also really like about their menu is their Ramen + (don or handroll or whatever) combo. For just a couple of extra dollars, I can get a mini chirashi don. 

The waitress is really nice. I quite enjoy her friendliness though it can be a bit overwhelming for those who don't like the super attentiveness. She makes you feel like you're not just coming into a restaurant, it's like going over to a friend's place. 

Also, they don't take credit card here.  Only cash or debit!"}
{"text":"Japanese Ramen King is not that good. 

The Good

- Customer Service They treat their customers well and try to talk to you about the food, they're also very active on social media (facebook, insta) so you can see what they're up to. 

- Lunch: Cheap lunch specials on the week days. Their curry-katsu don is pretty good. 

The Bad
- When we went for dinner, they didn't turn on their air conditioning. It was sweltering hot! 

-  My friend ordered tempura udon and got half an order of udon with 2 pieces of tempura, and they didn't even give him tempura sauce. $10.99


- They don't really seem to know what they're doing with some of their good product. For example,  they use  cheap  wasabi and don't have the appropriate sauce pairing with monk fish liver (either a ponzu-based sauce, or you can also lightly salt it.) They also put mayo in my tamago which got on the fish I ordered in my chirashi. If you want a place that serves fresh whole fish, go to Fin Izakaya -- they treat their product better. 

- Compared to ramen places downtown, their ramens all seem to fall flat. To be fair, I've only come a few times and sampled some of the ramen (including tonkotsu), but each one I've tried has been painfully average at best. For a place called \"Japanese Ramen King\", I find it strange that their sushi/sashimi stands out a little more. Go to Raijin, Isshin, Santouka, or Sansotei (new Markham location coming soon) instead. 

- 

- Wait times: Every time I've come here I've waited exceptionally long for my food. (20+ min). It's never been packed any of the times I've gone either. 

Overall
This place is just barely passable. If you're in the area, you won't find any better places, especially not for ramen. There are significantly better places though. I don't think the price is worth it."}
{"text":"The service is far above average! The waitress was very polite and her english was perfect. They took into account my dietary needs and whipped up a special vegan Mushroom ramen. It was absolutely delicious. The decor is fantastic and it looks authentic! As a ramen enthusiast, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wandering around that Midland plaza for food and decided to have a try. It was a weekday and we were the only table there. The restaurant isn't too big but it was quiet. Our server was really approachable too and we both were joking around, asking about the food too. Service was great!

Ordered two pieces of uni sushi. It was pretty fresh but not enough to satisfy my uni crave! We also ordered takoyaki balls that came in six. Those were nicely made and delicious.

On top, we had a bowl of soft pork belly ramen and bowl of chirashi. I didn't find it super delicious or special in the sashimi or noodles. They were decent but nothing awesome. Meat wasn't super soft but still chewy.

Although I gave it four stars, it would be overall a 3.5 out of 5. I'm a picky critic on food itself."}
{"text":"Out for a walk in search of some great eats and found this little place in the Midland plaza area. The wait staff was friendly, helpful and attentive [Can't say enough good here]. The food was good - we had the Ramen [I regret I did not order any sushi - this really seems to be one of their specialities] - Soft Pork & the Spicy Pork Belly. It was pretty good. I am only giving it 3 stars because the prices on the weekend seem rather high for what we got."}
{"text":"Where do I start? The waitress is really friendly. TOO friendly...I'm pretty sure we are best friends after thus experience. When we tried to order, she kept trying to upsell us the foie gras even when we said no several times. She also kept bugging us to get the uni, and we ended up getting it because it was getting a little annoying.

The food is below than average, and their miso soup is just horrible. It was served in a mug and it tasted like water...
I asked them to remake it, and it still came back like water. When I told the waitress it still tastes like water, she told me it was suppose to taste that way. I'd like to think had enough miso soup in my life to know what non-watery miso soup tastes like.

The sushi roll was pretty good but the nigiris rice is a little hard.

If you aren't picky about your sushi, you should be OK with this place but DO NOT order the miso soup.

EDIT: EVEN AS WE LEFT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FOIS GRAS LOOOOOLLLLL"}
{"text":"Went there with my friend at lunch time. Both of us ordered rice but the size was only 1/2 of the bowl and charged us $8-10. We weren't even full when we finished the food. I don't get how they can charge me for $8(before tax) for a veggie tempura rice and the veggies were chopped into very small pieces, not even a normal sliced size. Would never go back again. Thumbs down!!!!"}
{"text":"Superb food with a HUGE variety and great environment even though the restaurant only offer bar stool seatings. The staff were really friendly and will give you great recommendations! Make sure you ask the waitress what's fresh for that day! (Oh and no worries, the waitress' can also communicate in English!)"}
{"text":"Great chirashi don and curry dishes, ramen was decent, small place which would make a cozy venue with friends or a date night :)"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant with only 5 small tables. We came here during lunch and the waitress was very friendly and attentive. The waitress recommended something new they were trying which was the pork karaage ramen.
The soup base was ok, and the pork karaage was soggy because it was placed with the ramen.
We also ordered the 12 piece assorted sushi for $12.99 
The sushi was average, doesn't really stand out"}
{"text":"I love this place!

I went in with a couple friends just to try out their ramen, turns out to be a pleasant surprise.

First, the reason why I took off a star: it's not the food, nor the service. It's the physical limitation of space in the restaurant, and for what I've seen, the store owner has already tried to maximize the usage of the space without making it uncomfortably tight. It is, however, predictable that if they receive too many customers the place would be clamped. Not their fault though.

The interior design is very appropriate. Instantly you will see all the small touches that will remind you a family style Japanese joint.

And the service reflects that. The lady that served us lunch was funny, welcoming and engaging. We instantly felt like we walked into my family room. Whatever we asked for, even for free items like glasses of water, they didn't hesitate.

But then all these are nothing, unless the food holds up the quality.

And they did. With 4 people in the groupno, we ordered 2 appetizers, the Japanese curry poutine and deep fried chicken wings, and 4 bowls of 3 types of ramen. For the love of god I can't recall the proper Japanese names, but I'm just gonna say we all agree that these are some of the best ramens we've had for a while.

We all tasted each others' soup base, and we loved all of them. A friend of mine had the red miso base: slightly spicy but nothing unbearable, and the flavor was really well balanced. The other 2 ordered the garlic pork bone soup base... OMG they are DELICIOUS.

For me I took on the challenge on the \"hell\" ramen, but only at level 1 spiciness - yes I'm a wimp. Spicy soup base is very challenging to make, because if it's out of balance, you will only be able to feel the pain. I'm happy to report that, despite I was sweating my a** off from the spices, I could actually taste the flavors under the spiciness. And that doesn't happen a lot.

I was really focus on my bowl, so I didn't have a chance to try others' meat and eggs. My bowl of ramen, however, was excellent. The poached egg was cooked just right: not too runny, yet not like a piece of rubber.

But the real gem of the meal was actually the appetizers. The curry poutine was new to me: imagine regular poutine, but instead of gravy you get the mild Japanese curry. They go together very well. The chicken wings... Oh man, the chicken wings. I'm not gonna spoil the experience, but it's something you JUST have to try. I'm just gonna say, it's not the regular Japanese wings... Hell, even with hundreds of choices at those franchised wings specialty restaurants, I guarantee you won't find this style.

The waitress was very nice, and offered us deep fried fish skins at no extra charge. They are slightly seasoned and crispy like no tomorrow. With the mayo dipping sauce it's an unbelievable combo. I'd pay up to 8 bucks for an appetizer like this.

We also wanted to try the grapefruit sake, even just for lunch. Unfortunately they were all sold out.

I'll definitely come back when I have the chance. If lunch is this good, imagine the dinner...! Too bad after we stuffed ourselves with their homemade green tea pudding dessert, we don't really have the room for their sushi and rolls anymore. Definitely something to look forward to for the next visit.

Sorry for the lack of pictures. Didn't think of writing a Yelp review until after the satisfying meal. We were too busy at each others company and devouring the food to take pictures anyway...

We ended up paying $72 + tips for 4. Unlike what I've read afterwards, this is reasonable for Japanese cuisine, and we were STUFFED. Worth a revisit."}
{"text":"It's at a good location, the staff was very friendly . Order the daily special pork cutlet with spicy broth and takoyaki. The ramen was good and they were generous with the tako. Wil probably come back to try out other things in their menu."}
{"text":"Trying this place for the 1st time. This place doesn't disappoint. Soup is pretty good, rich in flavour but not salty. Good portions, and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Service was great. Quality of the ramen and appetizer was decent but their curry was bland, watery and portions was small."}
{"text":"I definitely would not call Japanese Ramen King the \"King\" of ramen. More like a squire...or maybe a Duke/Duchess. I have been to this location 4 or 5 times now. It's good enough to fill my craving when I can't make the trek downtown. The ramen broth is kind of monotone in flavour. The hakata ramen has very decent pork flavour. In general, everything in the bowl tastes the same, apart from the pickled bamboo and egg. Actually, the egg is one thing I wished tasted more like the broth.

Sushi
Okay a bit of a disclaimer here. I have a blue fish intolerance which means I can't eat fish such as salmon without getting very sick. I still eat sushi (usually shellfish) and usually don't have a problem, but at JRK I *always* get sick when I have their sushi. One time my BF also got sick and we were both in and out of the bathroom all night. Clearly, there are some cross contamination issues!

Seasonal drinks
Ah the redeeming factor...JRK has some really great seasonal drinks made from real fruit. Mango smoothies are so thick that your straw stands straight up. I am doubtful they water it down with anything by the pure and blissful taste of it. Limeade has a lot of lime for the lime lovers. And watermelon smoothies are 100% watermelon without anything else. Really really good. 5/5 here

Honestly, I think JRK has the potential to be a really good restaurant. They have a beautiful interior. Wait staff are very friendly and always smiling almost to a fault. I just wish I wouldn't get sick from their sushi. There is something wrong with their food handling or supply chain here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I feel about this place. The food was pretty good, but for the location, the ambiance and the price, I feel like I should have gotten bigger portions.

Had:

Soft pork bone ramen - first, nothing like the picture. Looks like they dumped everything in. Pork bone was tender and quite good. Plus. Ramen was mediocre. 

Curry beef don - curry was good. Very little beef. Quite sad, actually.

Tuna tartare - got tricked. They have pictures of food on their menu that don't correlate to menu items. Their excuse was that these pictures were of \"special items\" their customers had requested. I wanted the one in the picture. I did not get that one because I did not order the right thing (which wasn't on the menu). Disappointed.

Ankimo sushi - 2 pieces per order. In the wrong section of the menu. Taste-wise, pretty interesting. My first time. I'll probably have it again, but I doubt it'll be here.

Deep fried fish skin - not on the menu. Chef made this for us. Compliments of the house. They said they were going to give us complimentary dessert because we ordered so much. When we asked about this at the end of the meal, they said the fish skin was the replacement for the complimentary dessert. Complimentary, but what a rip off. Dessert for 5, or 5 small pieces of deep fried fish skin (which some people deign unworthy of consumption). Texture for this was super crispy, but I wasn't sure whether that was crispy because of the skin, or a fish scale crispy type of texture. 

Crab fried rice - good amount of crab. We asked for them to make a bigger plate of it for us (more rice). They said they did. Portion ended up regular sized for every restaurant but here.

Flying fish sashimi - never seen this one on a menu before. Interesting. Not my favorite kind of sashimi, but definitely worth trying. Presentation was nice. Shredded ginger on top was a nice touch as well.

Geoduck sashimi - not cheap. Definitely not cheap. Presented well too. Texture was lovely. Not as sweet fleshed as I would have liked though.

Baked oyster - chopped up oyster with mashed potatoes and other fillings. Not worth $9. Oyster flesh was delicious, but one oyster covered in mashed potato? I'm paying $8 for the mashed potato and the baking process? No thanks.

Stools for seating. Bad for people with bad backs (poor grandpa). Very little space in this restaurant. One server. If it got super busy, I can see that, coupled with the layout of the restaurant, posing a challenge. Friendly service though.

All in all, a splurge night for us (costed us about $30 per person, and I was only about 65% full at the end of the night)."}
{"text":"Wow, Yelpers are feeling generous? Japanese Ramen King is \"Okay gum la!!\"  imagine this in a heavy canto/hk accent because that's exactly the people who run this place. Had this place been a 3 star on yelp I wouldn't have gone in with such high expectations and be as disappointed as I am now.

We made the drive down from Markham and was super excited looking at all the beautiful pictures and yelp reviews. On first impression the place looks a bit small but pretty sleek and well decorated. We were acknowledged right away and seated quite quickly, great service. As we're about to take our seat by the bar the waitress had started to wipe down the bar that is closest to us. The only way I can explain the smell that came from that table cloth is like something that is in full fermentation. I think the wet towel has not been rinsed or properly dried in a while. The side that we were seated at smelled like it for the next 10 minutes until we moved a few seats over. After that I was having mad anxiety over the kitchens state of cleanliness. We stayed anyways and the menu is vast and covers more than what you will find at any AYCE menu there is just so much to look at. They seem eager to have something for everyone and less effort in perfecting a single dish.

We had:

Crab Pork bone cheese soup, there was a little dash of crab meat barely noticeable, pork was great, tasty fresh, a bit fatty, cheese was not special and the broth was not overly salty which I prefer and rare in ramen joints. 3/5 

Uni and Taro rice bowl - okay, not a superior cut of taro. it was quite lean?? 3/5

Lobster maki roll - the picture looked big and beautiful. When the dish came out and the lobster tail was the size of my pinky 2/5

Fried Oyster Izakaya - okay, it's fried oyster 2/5

Asahi Black beer - 5/5 They seem to have a huge range of Jap sake and drinks. Probably do not have great mixed drinks

Complimentary Dorayaki- pretty good green tea flavored - however the green tea icecream was not the good kind. - 3/5 

When I got home I had an unquenchable thirst which means there were lots of MSG in the meal. 

This place is not a authentic Ramen/ Izakaya experience or anything to be wowed by but probably great for a casual lunch spot or on a night you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I wish I've never been to this place. It's such a waste of time and money. the portion is small and the food is pricy."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place when we were hunting for dinner. In a relatively quiet plaza - although there are a million little restaurants in it. 

I would say this is kind of like a modern boutique ramen place. 5 tables total and some seating at the bar. So definitely not a place for big groups. 

We had the fresh juices of the day - limeade and watermelon juice (those were two separate drinks). Absolutely delicious and refreshing. Starting with a cold tofu appetizer which was a nice change and salmon sashimi - beautiful and firm. 

Mains were ramen - the soft pork and the garlic pork bone. I may have a new favourite type of ramen! Service was friendly, definitely got the vibe that they are eager for new business. Having been on a ramen hunt across downtown Toronto, I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for some decent ramen."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Super small portion. Weird TV shows. Annoying waiters. 

Keep forcing us to come back. Make better food and give bigger portions people will come without you asking."}
{"text":"YAAAAASS!! Found this when exploring the finch and midland plaza for a new place to nom. The store itself is super small and can probably hold 20 people max (including having people sit at the bar).. the workers are super friendly and greet you with smiles that stay with them the entire time. 

We started with some drinks- fresh limeade and fresh mango smoothie. Yum! It was definitely 'fresh', no sugary substances or artificial flavours added, just like she advertised. The mango smoothie was strictly mango with no added sugar, which is easy to detect when you've tasted the real thing before and not only the pacific mall 2 for $5 mango smoothies. The limeade was made from real limes and that was obvious from the chunks of lime found in the bottom of the drink and the strong bitter taste more towards the end of the drink. We also ordered the california rolls, which was fresh but pretty standard. Lastly, we had the ramen bowls. The boyfriend got fried chicken ramen (..why am I not surprised?), which was the $8.99 special of the day and I got the 'garlic pork bone' (had another japanese name, but I clearly don't remember). Indeed both bowls were fresh and the soup had 0 oiliness to it, which is a plus. 

The server was amazingly sweet and came back in intervals to ask us if we liked everything after we've finished every new thing that came out. They have a extensive menu that I'd love to come back and try more of."}
{"text":"Update: went back this weekend and tried their Sashimi special.. Didn't disappoint..Very fresh!!!   

Tried their special pork bone soup ramen and the broth is very flavorful and hearty. Their noodles are not too soft or soggy with the just rite amount of elasticity & chewiness which I like my noodles to be that way

Also, on a recommendation, ordered the pumpkin salad. quite unique dish. never had it before..  

wanted to order the curry rice but didn't have no more room for it. 

There are more choices on the menu since the restaurant opened a week and a half ago.. and it is not just about ramen.  It also offers also sushi, sashimi, rice, izakaya items etc.   The restaurant also does take out. 


The owner Eva is also very nice and helpful when it comes to ordering. 

Definitely a must check place if you are in the area.

the only downfall the place is a little bit small 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This restaurant just opened today.  

Though I only got to try only a few things today due to this place having just opened officially at 12pm, I was quite satisfied with my bowl of ramen..the soup wasnt too salty. The ramen comes with pork, egg and some veggies. If u were worried about the saltiness, u can ask them to reduce the salt.... The noodles were quite chewy and quite fresh..very well made.

Their menu looks quite extensive..I cannot.wait to try the many items they offer next time since it wasn't available yet..ranging from ramen...to donburi ..to maki sushis.... To desserts.....

The place.is off to a good start... I cannot wait to go back during the week once they are fully up and running.. so that I can try the many things they offer on their menu."}
{"text":"Cold Ramen with Angus Tataki was a new treat especially on a hot Toronto day. Accompanied by the Matcha Smoothie with sweet red beans. What a find. Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I had the shaoyu based seafood ramen. The soup tastes great, however the portion is rather small for the price. Out of everything contained in a bowl there is only about 15% noodles, 10% toppings and the rest 75% is all soup.  That costs me around $11.

I also ordered  one seaweed salad for $4.5. The portion was equivalent to 3 teaspoons. I litterally finished the salad in 3 scoops."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night around 8pm. I must admit this restaurant is cute and cozy however the service was horrible. When we were ready to order the waitress said to us word for word with a cocky attitude \"but I'm not ready to take your orders...\" and stared at us. We asked why and she proceeded to say that there was a back order and it would take a while before our food would be prepared. I think we would appreciate it more if she notified us before seating us instead of having that straight up cocky attitude. At this point we were annoyed and just left."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Chinese-run ramen place. 

I got the Shio Ramen - I liked the soup and noodles.
-  good, hot, flavorful soup, not too salty
-  noodles - thick, yellow, wavy
- Comes with bamboo shoots, \"wood ear fungus\", cha siu, and  1/2 egg - too bad for my friends whose eggs were HARD BOILED! No need to pre-cook egg when traffic is low??

The Red Miso broth was flavorful too. 

Maybe not the best idea to eat ramen on a hot day. We were sweating and there is no A/C. At least she gave us some green tea icecream at the end!

We came on a Sunday for lunch and it was empty until after 1pm. The menu is very extensive (10+ ramen varieties, rice, sashimi, snacks...)  but they were sold out of croquettes.... 

Service was overly friendly to the point where it seems very fake, which I cannot tolerate."}
{"text":"A very tiny restaurant! Food is very good though for the price. Decent size and not bad at all. The interiors of the restaurant quite modern and clean."}
{"text":"Happened to find this place tonight via random search on yelp (for dinner ideas) and decided to try it out. My hubby and I love ramen but we have not found any good places in Scarborough. 

Place is new - opened early this month. Space is cozy and the decor is nice and clean. We were greeted warmly and led to one of the high table with bar stools. 

I ordered pork ramen and my hubby ordered one of their hot plate items (angus beef). Im used to the potent flavors of the ramen in our usual places downtown (my husband says salty but i say flavorful), so i find their soup milder. So I chatted with our very helpful server about it. She said they put less salt and no msg in their soups, and the broth is stewed for a good amt of time. Hubby wasnt blown away by the hot plate (he rates it 6/10). I rate my ramen at 7/10. 

The server recommended dessert options and we took the tree rain cake. I haven't had this before so i said sure. Surprisingly good - not too sweet, and not too bland. 

Price wise - could be better. Our tab came up to $40. And the items we ordered were specials. 

I give 4 stars for this place because the staff are really nice. And the place look clean.  And i want to give them a chance as it's new business :) The food, did not blow me away but it has potential.

They have a wide selection of food. Maybe i will try their sashimi next if I come back."}
{"text":"Just like others before me I must agree that the service is above average. It was like I was eating at my grandma's. However, I'm not too sure if the service would be as great if you didn't speak Cantonese/Mandarin. Didn't get a chance to test her English as I was speaking Cantonese with her but based just on the waitresses personality I would have to guess the service would be just as great. She was very personal and very easy to speak with plus she always had a huge smile.

As for the food it was pretty decent. Nothing mindblowing but comparable to other Japanese ramen places. She asked if I was feeling hungry when I put through my order and naturally I said yes since I'm such a big eater. She then said she would put some extra rice for me. That was so sweet of her. I got the basic pork ramen with grilled salmon rice bowl combo for $15.50. There were huge pieces of pork and the ramen was nice and chewy. Soup was very good and not overly salty so totally drinkable. The salmon was diced up into small pieces and served on rice with crispy seaweed.

They also have a lot of sushi options but didn't get a chance to try. The layout of the store is small and only had bar stool seating. Even the table seats were bar stools so it was difficult to find a spot to put my winter jacket. So I just ended up squishing it under my rear end and let it hang down the bar stool.

An extra 0.5 for service

{"text":"Japanese ramen king!! So this place is located so close to me it's a blessing! I don't have to go downtown to eat ramen since we found this place! 

This place is a small hidden ramen izakaya in the new plaza by midland and finch. There is lots and I mean lots of parking everywhere! The place is small and it holds like 25-30 people roughly. The staff are super friendly and very proficient in English!  

They have specials everyday and they will tell you them as it literally changes each week. I ordered deep fried chicken ramen and yum it was delicious. It wasn't a over the top crazy bowl of ramen, but a simple bowl! It was a good bowl of ramen. They are made fresh so it might take some waiting for your bowl. We also ordered California rolls and those were very nice. Definitely will try more sushi there! 
We also tried the lemon lime juice and mango drink and those were amazing! 

This place has a TV and blesss for Netflix on it! 

Definitely will come back to here!"}

History time!

The owners of Japanese Ramen King used to run Yokozuna. No, not the current one on Silver Star, but at Commerce Gate around 10 years ago. When Yokozuna closed, they moved to a similar Japanese restaurant at Woodbine/Apple Creek, which lasted around 5 years. The owners took a few years off to travel overseas and explore other cuisines, but finally returned to open Japanese Ramen King! Best thing was they still remember me. Shockingly. It's been at least 8 years since I've seen the owner or the head waitress.

After a long intro on what's available, we ordered a takowasa to start, as well as a Yokohama ramen. The takowasa tasted very good, and for those who aren't very tolerant of wasabi, it's not that spicy! The Yokohama ramen was decent for a non-authentic ramen. Perhaps the only issue I had was the soup base didn't have enough taste to it, as there wasn't that garlic addition I was used to in many of the ramen restaurants downtown.

As we were finishing our meals, the owner gave us a small order of okonomiyaki on the house. It tasted very good! It's not in the menu, but occasionally you would see it in the specials section in the restaurant blackboard. If you follow their Facebook page you'll see some additional creations they have that don't necessarily make it to the menu.

I'm super glad to see the owners back in business here! Highly recommended for sure."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new restaurant around my area and I decided on here after reading a few reviews. Jennifer K mentioned that the service was unlike any other Chinese restaurants and I have to agree - the people here were super friendly and helpful!

I had to get the pumpkin salad since I'm an addict to anything pumpkin. The price for this dish was seasonal. The dish itself was a lot larger than it looked on picture. It was a very delicious and I've never had anything quite like this. I would highly recommend it and it's definitely a dish I'll be going back for again.

Next, I got the garlic pork bone soup ($9.95). I can't say that it's anything special but the broth was not too salty which I enjoyed. I've had better ramen and I had worse so I guess this was average for me.

We also tried a few of their sushi and it was also average. I wouldn't recommend getting sushi if you were to come here unless if you have a serious craving for some!

The seating arrangements were not very comfortable in my opinion since I'm not a fan of stool seating. However, the food and the service were great so I'll be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Since it's -11 today and we were around the area, we decided to try this new place ... \"Japanese Ramen King.\" I've heard that they've been open for (just) almost 3 months (as of today) now ... fairly new. 

The ambiance and/or the interiors of the restaurant itself is different from the usual ramen house. From New York, Hong Kong, Philippines, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Toronto most of the ramen houses that I have been to have wood elements inside - be it walls, tables etc. 

Anyway, going back to the food. I ordered Hakata Ramen (one of the basic ramens that they have), while my husband ordered Miso Ramen. We also ordered Takoyaki on the side. 

1. Hakata Ramen (10.95) - not the typical (strong) pork broth with that certain \"creamy\" taste. It is not salty as well. The serving is really generous (well, for me I suppose). In terms of the pork itself, it's really soft. The owner told us that they did not use any MSG for their ramen, which is good news for all health conscious people! =)

2. Miso Ramen ($7.95) - my husband liked it! I trust his opinion 'coz he's a good cook. The serving is smaller than the Hakata one.  

3. Takoyaki ($6.95) - First of all, I want to say that it does not taste nor smell \"fishy\" at all.  I am kind of specific with the smell because sometimes it makes my appetite turn. There are 6 balls per serving, which is kind of fair ... and the size is just right. Perfect for one big bite =) The sauce on top of it was also commendable - i like it! Although I must mention that the size of the octopus inside the ball was kind of small. 

Addition:
We received a complementary dessert from the restaurant, they call it DORAYAKI. It's kind of like a pancake with filling (if I remember it right ... it has chickpeas with fine matcha powder). To be honest, I really don't eat peas in general ... but this dessert was just too good to say \"pass.\" I can finally say, \"Chickpeas virgin no more.\"

Service. Although we had to seat ourselves because the server at that time was attending to something ... I can still say that I like their service. The owner/server was really good in communicating - she can even discuss the ingredients of your food and at the same time, make recommendations. 

Overall, lovely experience!

Hope this review can help =)"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and great food.  My only gripe is the price.  It's not super expensive,  but it is more than other Ramen Restaurants"}
{"text":"Decided to come to this place by chance with a few friends (actually wanted to go to the Chatime across but was feeling hungry). This place did not disappoint! 


Interior:
The place is small and to some people that may be a throw off, but to me it was alright. It would have been nice if it was bigger but you can't get everything. 

Service:
Like many previous reviews, the waitress' customer service was on POINT. From the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave, these ladies treated you well. They were very attentive and friendly, and didn't have a problem with stirring up conversation (which didn't seem forced). One of my friends was a bit thrown off by this but it didn't irk her enough for it to be bad. It was our first time coming to this place and they made us feel right at home.

Food: We didn't make it for the lunch special, so just ordered straight from the menu. The menu had variety of options, from Ramen to Curry to Sashimi bowls to Maki. This is what we ordered:
- Katsu Curry $7.99: Both of my friends order the Katsu Curry. The portion was alright, could have had more rice, but it was decently priced too so I wouldn't complain (just need more rice *hint hint*). The curry was really good. I'm not a curry expert but if I was to come back, I'd probably get the curry.
- Cha Siu Ramen combo $15.99 (special requested order): I ordered the combination of Cha Siu Ramen + a 6 piece Spicy Salmon maki - which was not on the menu; I asked for a substitution which the waitress was happy to do for me. It did cost $3 more to sub the spicy salmon instead of the California that was offered, but I didn't mind, already in the mood for salmon anyways. The Spicy Salmon maki was bigger than I thought. It was more fish to rice ratio and you can tell the fish was fresh. It wasn't necessarily \"spicy\" but I've gotten use to Spicy Salmon maki not actually being \"spicy\" from other places, so it was fine. Nevertheless it was delicious. The ramen was pretty good. It might not be \"the best ramen\" but if you're craving ramen or just want ramen to eat, this is a good option too for someone living in Scarborough.  It may not come up to par to the Downtown and Markham spots, but for someone who isn't really picky about their food and enjoys ramen, I give my approval.
- Chicken Karaage $6.50: The chicken karaage was alright. I've had better in some places but I guess if you want chicken this is a good appetizer. 
All together our meal was approx. $44 and all of us were stuff to the bone.

Final thoughts:
I don't usually write reviews on Yelp but this place got me writing. Like I said, the food is decent but I wouldn't go in there with the highest expectations. It's just a cozy spot to eat with close friends/family and enjoy decent food. If you're in the area, give this place a shot cos I would go again!
Sidenote: didn't actually make it to Chatime... was too full."}
{"text":"found this little place and wanted to try it out for lunch.
server was really friendly and very informative.
chef has over 20 years of exp.
the lunch specials change on the daily depending on the ingredients that they have available as the chef picks ingredients at the market himself.
usually they will not be items that you can find on the menu but can be a combination of some sometimes.
another thing the server mentioned was that they are very flexible with altering the entrees to your preference, provided that they have the ingredients to do so. 
anyways, i was originally going to order a ramen but then when i skimmed through the menu and saw omurice, i decided that i had to try it because i LOVE omurice. i also ordered the japanese poutine just because i was curious.

the omurice is a chicken fried rice wrapped in an omelet. very simple. and on top there is ketchup. i tihnk the omurice was $10-11. based on that, i can't say i got my monies worth. the portion was smaller than what im used to and it was also $3-4 more expensive as well. as a lover of omurice though, here are ways that this dish could b better. have the rice be curry chicken fried rice. and along with ketchup have mayo on top. actually when i think about the portions, these were japanese sized portions. when i went to japan a number of years back, i remember i had to eat 2 japanese meals for every meal to fill my fat american gut.

anyways the japanese poutine. this was ok, but again, japanese sized servings. there were fries of course, and i believe also cubed potatoes as well. there may have needed a bit more cheese but mayb not, since instead of gravy, i think it was a curry that was poured over the spuds.

anyways, im inclined to give japanese ramen king another try as i feel like they can do better and the service was really good."}
{"text":"Came to this place after working out with friends. This restaurant is very small. There are three desks. We were a group of 5. We almost fill the whole place. 

We didn't do sharing as they mainly serve noodle soup and curry rice. The food came at a reasonable speed. However, the portion is small. Most of my friends ordered a second dish. The price is not cheap it is around 15 dollar for a noodle soup.

The server is very friendly. She is so passionate that It is kind of overwhelming. She kept recommending different dishes, and asking for feedback. She kept asking us how do you hear about us, how do you like the food, etc. It is a bit annoying while you are trying to enjoy the food.

In conclusion, this place is too pricey for such portion of food. The service is too good."}
{"text":"3.5 Star 

The staff here at Japanese Ramen King is super friendly and helpful, not your typical \"Chinese\" restaurant experience. I would come back again to eat just because of them.

$6.99 Lunch Special which changes everyday. It can be rice bowl or ramen or whatever the kitchen might prepare. 

I was a little disappointed when I dropped by for lunch today with the special being Squid Rice Bowl. I want RAMEN! Noodle Soup!! The waitress said they can change that to a ramen! They are just so accommodating!

I want to have a snack too. She suggested chicken karaage and she can put in as a half order for me, SOLD! 

Squid Ramen ($6.99) lunch special
I like the noodle of the ramen which cooked perfectly with a chewy bit. The broth was simple and light and served steaming hot!! Squid was tender and plentiful.  

Chicken Karaage ($3.50) was A-OK. The chicken was not overcooked but if they were cut a little thicker, the pieces would be more juicy and meaty.

Japanese Ramen King does have quite a few varieties of Ramen with different kind of broth, I guess I need to come back to give them a try. And of course Sushi and Sashimi! Maybe with some sake!

BTW, if you want anything or any combination, just ask. They are flexible and more than willing to make you happy."}
{"text":"Went and got 

Nagasaki ramen (seafood, meat) and the toppings were good, the noodles weren't hand made which wasn't as great.  The broth was average.  

Uni sushi was amazing.  Prob one of these best I've had.  Very fresh. 

Service was very nice, knowledgeable.  There was a new guy there. Was nice, but didn't really know the menu very well yet 

Overall pretty good"}
{"text":"Japanese Ramen King is a tiny restaurant located in a newer plaza on Midland. The restaurant is located on the right side of the plaza when turning in from Midland. 

Upon entering into the restaurant, we were greeted and seated promptly. Not many tables in the restaurant. 

Ordered: 
Miso Ramen- Decent, not as good as Santouka but definitely better than Niwatei (J-Town) 

Black Dragon Roll (avocado, cucumber and crab meat topped with unagi)
    - not worth $19.99 (RIPOFF!)
   -Theres no shrimp tempura (I've never had a black dragon roll without shrimp tempura) 

Grilled Salmon on rice (part of combo with Miso Ramen): 
     -didn't like it at all 
      -very oily 
      -very fishy (as in they didn't use ginger/ lemon juice/ onions to reduce the fishy taste enough) 

Crab Roe Salad:OK 
       -not much crab meat   

Service: Server was attentive but seemed to be way too friendly. 

Overall: Would return as close to home but definitely will not reorder the black dragon roll or grilled salmon on rice"}
{"text":"I'm in utter disbelief of the positive reviews received by this establishment. I came here for the first time today and asked for their lunch special and was disappointed that they \"did not offer lunch special on holiday\". 

Assorted 3 salad - fairly decent however for $7.50 this is a ripoff 

Pork rib ramen - broth was sour in taste, could not finish. Not sure why fried pork ribs came separately from the ramen??

Kimchi ramen - tastes like they dumped kimchi and ramen into water 

Overall, no thought given to the taste or combination of ingredients. Would not recommend. 

Ajisen ramen is in the same price range and tastes must better."}
{"text":"If I had gotten the correct order, this place would have deserved a higher rating. 

I came here with two friends and let me tell you, the seating here is very tight. We found a way to squeeze in and all ordered. None of us got the correct order (my bowl was actually given to my friend by accident, but the rest of our bowls seemed completely random). Since we didn't want to wait too long for another bowl, we decided to just eat what we were given (on the plus side, the bowls we were given were actually more expensive and they said they wouldn't charge the difference considering it was their mistake). Ramen itself here is okay. Nothing spectacular, but alright. 

I don't remember her name, but the waitress here is the friendliest person ever. Eerily enough, she looked exactly like one of my friends and acted like her too. I had to text my friend to ask if she had a relative who worked here because it weirded me out too much. Anyway, she was super friendly and made my experience so much better than what it could've been. 

I don't think I'd return just because of how tiny the place is, and the mix up with our orders left a bad impression on me."}
{"text":"Fresh and a variety of good sushi.

Small little Japanese place with friendly and knowledgable staff. The seats weren't the most comfortable of choices and the coat hanger is by the door, no place to put a bag. Went for the ramen but decided to get a sushi platter to try. The ramen was decent but nothing special and the grilled salmon rice was good. The best part was the sushi platter. Was going to try the assorted sushi but got the deluxe sushi instead because the waitress highly recommended it. Was not disappointed at all, presentation was amazing and it tasted great.

Overall, will definitely be back for more sushi platters."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is very attentive, this may or may not be a positive for some. The seats are all bar stools and the space is quite tight so if you are with small children this may not be ideal. Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant."}
