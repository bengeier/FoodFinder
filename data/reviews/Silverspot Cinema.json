{"text":"We had high hopes for this theater.  We used to frequent another version of the \"dine-in theater\" before we moved to Cleveland.

SUMMARY:

I spent $220+ to feed two kids under 8 and two adults (including 3 drinks and a $40 bottle of prosecco).  No apps or desserts. That's not including the movie tickets or popcorn. 

The food is average (think Ruby Tuesday/TGIF) but the price is steep.  I'd expect to pay a little more than a TGIF but they're pushing it.  Stick to the burgers and chicken strips.  Stay away from the entrees.  The Charcuterie board is a blatant rip-off.  My mixed drink was sad and while at the bar the middle-aged couple next to me were complaining that their drinks were weak.  Stick to wine and beer.

They are disorganized and ask you to keep to a strict time schedule that they can't adhere to.  Our theater wasn't clean when we showed up and we were invited to stand around and wait \"10-15 minutes.\" They never told us we could finally go into the theater, we had to just keep asking until they said fine. At that point a relaxed experience (everyone's seats are reserved) became a mob-dash to get in and order before the movie started.  To quote our waiter, \"once the previews start I'm gone and not coming back.\"  When you do get in, expect confusion and wrong food orders.  Order quickly, don't make it too complex.  There was waitstaff wandering the aisles with food praying someone would recognize their own food.  Our waiter had to call a manager because he insisted \"bucket of beers\" wasn't a thing (it's on the menu).  Even the manager had to ring it up as a pitcher + a note saying it wasn't.  When he finally got it entered and my wife asked for a bottle of prosecco he opined that it was too much alcohol for 2 people.  After alcohol-shaming us I passed on the beers.

If you actually want to see most of your movie, don't bother heading out to the bar if you need a second drink (or a first one because your waiter cut you off BEFORE you start drinking) or god forbid more food.  The bar was always busy and the staff was disorganized and in panic mode.  It took me 10-15 minutes each time to get another drink (just a beer).  At one point a bar tender took my credit card and disappeared with it for 10 minutes.  I tried to flag down a manager who literally looked at me then ran away. Not what you want when you're trying to get back to the movie.

It may seem like a fun place to take the kids but it really isn't kid friendly.   The lobby is a bar and there were no other kids (which we thought was odd since Incredibles II).  At one point the police were called (I'm guessing unruly patrons) and it became apparent that it just isn't a place for kids. 

The seats are comfortable and I'm happy to pay a few extra dollars for a reserved seat.  If I came back I would eat at one of the 1,000 cheaper and better restaurants in Beachwood/Orange and then come here to order a pitcher of beer/bottle of wine and relax on a date.  I will not be back until the reviews reflect that they're better organized."}
{"text":"The concept is great but the execution is lacking.

The girlfriend and I decided we would try out the new theater in town as a date night since we got a free ticket for signing up through the app.  With the app you can buy movie tickets and pre-order full entrees along with the normal movie concessions. 

We ordered a crispy chicken sandwich with a salad as the side, sliders, and pretzel bites with cheese.  That with 2 medium soft drinks and 1 movie ticket came out to $70.  So if you added another movie ticket it would be around $90 which is a little pricey but it is convenient to watch a movie and eat dinner at the same place. 

We decided to get there a bit early so we had time to take in everything.  This is where things started going south. 

When you walk in the front door, all you see is a staircase and an elevator down a hallway.  There is no signage telling you where to go.  Nothing that says go upstairs.  So you are left to wander down the hall and when there is nothing else, you walk upstairs.

The first thing you see is a 360 degree bar in the center.  But still there is no signs to instruct you.  so if you continue around the corner you will run into their guest services desk and self serve ticket booths.  From their you walk down the hall to a couple of attendants that scan a barcode on the app and tell you which theater you are in.

We found the theater and our seats with no problem. A waitress quickly came over and asked if we had been there before and explained the whole process.  Once we told her we had ordered the food already through the app she left and we never saw her again.  

The pull out trays were dirty with what looked like mayo so we had to find napkins to clean it ourselves. Kind of weird since the trays are designed to be super easy to wipe down and they place is better lite than a normal theater so you could clearly see that they weren't clean. 

Our food came out about 10 minutes before showtime.  Thich was great because it gives you the opportunity to see what you are eating.  The problem is that they brought out fries for her meal instead of the salad that we paid an up-charge for and they didn't pay attention to the request to remove an item she didn't like from the sandwich.  The good news is that when we told them about the salad, they promptly brought one out.  

My sliders were really good.  they dont ask how you would like them cooked but I lucked out that they were cooked medium-well.  She said that her chicken sandwich tasted like cardboard. But the true star were the pretzel bites.  They take soft pretzels, cut them up, and deep fry them to give a crispy exterior.  they are served with a beer cheese that was to die for. At no point did anyone check to make sure we had everything we needed.  When we had an issue, I had to flag a random server down.  For the price you are paying for the food, and the mandatory 18% gratuity I would think the service would be a little better.

After that everything was as it should be.  The power reclining seats are comfortable.  The staff we did interact with were all polite (maybe not happy to be there) but polite. 

I dont think we will go back only because for the price we can get better food elsewhere and go to Cinemark Valley View if we want to have seats that recline which is cheaper as well. We also weren't huge fans of all the distractions during the movie of servers constantly walking through."}
{"text":"Five-Star concept, One-Star execution.   My mom and I were excited to go see the new and great theater.  When we went into our theatre, there were dirty dishes and garbage at all the seats from the previous showing...quite disappointing.  It was sort of like going to what you thought was a nice hotel and then walking into a room that hadn't been cleaned.   The food ranged from fair to decent and the service was pretty bad.   Apparently people don't use napkins or silverware because we had to ask three times to get it and by then we had picked though most of our food with our fingers.  The actual theatre and seats were great, so the movie experience was good, which is why I didn't give it one star.    I might go back some day to give them a second chance, but I am certainly not going to tell everyone to go."}
{"text":"Went tonight for Jurassic Park. It's very disorganized from the moment you walk in - either walking up unlabeled stairs or taking an elevator up to an open bar area which is crowded and difficult to navigate around to find the ticket area. We had Arrived early as instructed but they don't let you enter the theater until at least 30 minutes before. We grabbed two drinks and an app while waiting. Lots of choices on the menu but the prices can be fairly steep if you order anything aside from a burger, sandwich or flat bread. Minimal healthy options. Can't comment on the alcoholic drinks but prices seemed on par with most restaurants in downtown Cleveland with fairly good selections. 

We ordered food on the app as they recommend you do, but no server came to check on us or confirm our order. We ordered chicken tenders, and two flatbreads. The chicken tenders arrived very cold without the extra sauce we requested. The flatbreads never showed up. At one point, the server gave us the wrong food and we had to flag them down to come back and get it, but never bought the right pizzas. After the cold chicken fingers and popcorn, we were fairly full and there was never another waitstaff person around to ask for the rest of our food. They refunded us the price of the pizzas and chicken tenders, but still it was an expensive trip to the movies. 

Chairs are very comfortable! 

Great concept but just disorganized and executed poorly. Not on par with other fine dining/movie establishments we have visited before. The waitstaff all appear so busy and running around chaotically - felt bad for them."}
