{"text":"I've never had pizza from here that I can remember. I only ever come for the chicken souvlaki. The Chicken is juicy and tender and you get so much on your plate for the price! I can never finish it all which honestly they should probably change their portion sizes especially the sides. It's good though!  I've been coming here for years and I've never had a bad meal yet. I'm hesitant on the pizza after reading some of your reviews. That's okay though I have other pizza loves in my life. The service is always good it's never too busy. The food doesn't take that long it's all good to me.  I had a take out lasagna from here once and it was good too. From what I remember the pasta was on the harder side which I actually like but it's not for everyone."}
{"text":"Staff was not very friendly. Called for a pick up order. Girl on phone sounded like she couldn't possibly hate her job more. Was quoted 20 minutes but waited 40 minutes for food. Pizza was alright . would not order again."}
{"text":"Somehow, this restaurant has become our regular go to for a nice, simple dinner out. The food is always great, albeit sometimes a little long to come out. The service is from the 'plain-dressed-and-call-you-honey' group, and they are always friendly and attentive. I much prefer the restaurant side than the lounge side, but that is likely just a vibe/personal preference for my wife and me.  I love their French Onion soup, and have enjoyed their pizzas and pastas. With some allergy issues on my wife's side, some of the ordering gets specific, and have never had an issue (and we can't say that very often)."}
{"text":"Greco's has the best beef souvlaki in Calgary. Souvlaki comes in many shapes and styles so to clarify, this Souvlaki is in the kebab/skewer style. When cooked medium rare this is arguably some of the best beef, let alone souvlaki in the city. The dish comes with the best greek salad in Calgary bar none and your choice of rice or baked potato and tzatziki. All in it's great value and prepared consistently every time. The only downside is that the restaurant is not sexy, it is a basically a family restaurant. But it's clean, service is good and the food is great. Try it."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here, Greek salad and lasagna!! I've ordered pick up from here for over 10 years and never disappointed.  I patronize a business because of what they do best and their Greek style pizza and sauce is so yummy."}
{"text":"I know my pizza. I am at least an enthusiast, possibly even an expert - I practically lived at a friends pizza shop when I was a kid and worked in one for years before graduating - and I was broke enough to eat pizza everyday because it was free.  I say Greco's is the best pizza in town. Loaded with toppings - perfect sauce, perfect crust, and the specialty pizza's are solid. Its a bit of a drive for me but who cares.   Complaints about interior design (the word sexy is a pro and family is a con when attached to a pizza place? Seriously?...Seriously?!) are ridiculous. You want to be pretentious go to Bonterra's or Teatro's they have ok pizzas - but you won't enjoy yourself half as much and the pizza isn't half as good. Trust me, if you feel you need to impress with a sexy/modern pizza shop just get a new friend/girlfriend/wife instead and relax. Greco's has the right look for what it is."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere. Had the onion soup and Greek pizza. Not much to say except that both were really cheesy and really tasty. The staff was friendly and it's open late which is a huge plus as well."}
{"text":"This place is centerally located. The Pizza is good. The portions on items like the Greek Salad(village or standard) are always generous. My Wife and I often share a Village salad and there Steak and Spagetti special. These two items fill us up with a bit to take home too. I bet we go here 20 times a year and have always been amazed at the freshness and quality time after time. It's not the fanciest, but the decor is what you expect from a family run Greek place. I'd rather have good food(with generous portions) and standard decor, that crappy food with a million dollar decor. What they are doing here is time tested and seems to work well. When we want delicous greek food and no surprises, we usually go here.  BTW there is alot of parking both in front and on the side street around this location."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pizza I've ever eaten; and that's saying a lot! What makes the pizza, besides the fresh ingredients, is the delicious sauce! They don't put very much of it on unfortunately, so I ALWAYS ask for extra sauce!  Everything else that I've had the pleasure of tasting on the menu so far has been great as well.  The only real downside is the interior design. A little dated."}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the yelp reviews. I did take out, a large half and half pizza. This thing was ready in 20 min, and rang in at about $21. Coming in to pick this thing up was great, the staff in this place are super friendly and the lounge half was totally bumping. Looked like a good place to be on a Friday night (kind of reminiscent of the Garneau pub - maybe a little cleaner - as reference for you Edmonton folk out there).   The pizza itself was a heavy, cheese laden beast. The crust is fluffy and thick, which is neccessary to support the load of toppings heaped on it! My pizza was not cut into squares as Matt B.'s was, which was kind of dissapointing because I was looking forward to that after reading his review! Maybe they only do that on the XL.   I don't mind this kind of pizza once and a while but it's really just too much cheese and bread for me. The kind of pizza where you start in on your second slice and wonder if you will be able to get up from the couch when you finish it.  I also think it's better to eat this stuff in house, by the time I got home (10 min drive) the bottom of the box was soggy...."}
{"text":"I had a craving a for a large, tasty pizza, so after much searching on Yelp we settled on this place.   I quite enjoyed the atmosphere here - it seemed familiar somehow. It reminded me a bit of a restaurant I'd worked in before they had done a major facelift.  I'd ordered the onion soup and a 15\" bacon, mushroom, ham, & pineapple pizza. The onion soup was quite good, and far more filling than I'd expected. There was a lot of bread in it.  When the pizza came out, I was surprised at how it was cut - rather than a traditional slice, they had cut a round pizza into squares. And with good reason - this pizza was so loaded with cheese and toppings there is no way one could lift a normal style slice and not have issues with keeping it as one slice. Very good pizza - the leftovers were still delicious a couple days later.  This is definitely another place I can see myself coming back to repeatedly."}
{"text":"You'd think that a Greek restaurant would make a good Greek salad.  It was the only thing I ordered.  It was a lot of iceberg lettuce in a soupy dressing, very little feta cheese and veggies were chopped too finely, like they used pizza toppings.    My friend had the baked lasagna which was dry, not enough sauce.  A real disappointment.  Absolutely no care or thought was put into our food.  Where's the love?"}
{"text":"Seriously....canned mushrooms. I wonder if I even ate at the same place as these other reviewers. I don't consider canned mushrooms fresh vegetables and for that matter the peppers were sliced so thin they became soggy. Another reviewer said that they don't put enough sauce on it, I have a sauce stain I my shirt that would argue that. The sauce tasted really weird (sorry I can't put my finger on the specifics of it)Yes there was a lot of cheese but that hardly makes up for the inferior ingredients. It tasted like it was a frozen pizza. Needless to say I will not be ordering from there again"}
{"text":"Created yelp account just to comment. My usual pizza place was closed today so gave Grecos a shot. Was charged $55 for a large pepperoni and a large feta, mushroom and spinach, $8 of which was a delivery charge. According to yelp I live 1.8km away and was charged $8! Ridiculous. Even the delivery guy thought that was messed up. The pizza was mediocre at best. Would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"We ordered a XL Greek pizza and a large meat pizza for $50.00. My bf found it way too greasy, but I thought it was tasty. Lots of topping and a crispy old school type of crust. I preferred the meat pizza over the Greek, which was pretty much like a vegetarian pizza as we couldn't find any meat. Pricey. I wasn't crazy about the cheese either. I think I'll checkout some other places just to compare. Hanni's is still best in my books. Service on the phone was good."}
{"text":"I love this place, the wings the platters, the pizza all Excellent and the bar specials are always great! Wish I lived closer so I could go more!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place, the lounge is a fun place to grab a drink and eat.  This week it was so cold we called in an order to pick up and take home, the food was just as good to take home!  The  crust is really good and the more than abundant toppings never miss!"}
{"text":"It would be nice not to be seated and then informed of kitchen closing within the half hour AND also offering water and explaining how; quote \" I'll have to wait until you're finished to leave\".  Maybe the staff can brush up on customer relation skills... Google how to."}
{"text":"Greco's is always a good time. Came here on a weekend night and were afraid we'd have trouble finding a table but it wasn't a problem.   French Onion soup was great, though perhaps a little too much bread, and the village salad was awesome, as usual. The portions are big, great value for money.  Both pizzas were well received, sauce is good, lots of cheese and toppings. All in all, Greco's is a neighbourhood place that I will keep coming back to over and over again. Looks a little dive-y and the decor is a bit dated but it just adds to the atmosphere.  (14/30)"}
{"text":"Greco's Pizza is located in a small strip mall and is often a busy place .  Favoured by locals in the area and those who love a good homey cooked meal or delicious pizza!  They also have a lounge right next door accessible through the restaurant dining area as well.  This is the place we love to come when I have a craving for their individual lasagne entree.  Comes piping hot and full of little strips of pasta smothered with meat sauce and topped with a crust of melty crispy cheese! My little niece now loves this choice as much as me.  Sometimes we take our whole family here and they enjoy the Greek souvlaki dinners which are quite tasty! We order the village Greek salad to start off and it's always a delight to eat with fresh cucumbers, tomatoes , olives and feta! My husband and the guys also love Grecos thick pizzas loaded with mile long stretchy cheese and generous toppings!  Comes piping hot and always a hit when we crave pizza!  Greco's is a place with great home cooking and my happy place to go to when I'm not in the mood to cook but love good food!"}
{"text":"Good food, excellent prices!   We ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce (not the baked spaghetti) and the Greek salad.  Had their lasagna and pizza last week.  The spaghetti didn't blow me away, but the lasagna was great.  Next time I might try the baked spaghetti.  The salad was very good, we really enjoyed it.  This is a great little place."}
{"text":"The food here for the most part is very delicious. They have daily specials that are all well priced. The staff are all very friendly. The pizza is good with generous toppings. My favourite dish of all time is their village Greek salad. Though the actual restaurant is a little dated it has the charm of a family run business. A great place to grab a meal during the week."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I do not have a review for their pizza, which (given the name) I'm assuming is their specialty. My cousin and I stopped here for a bite to eat because a) it's close by and b) she said it was reasonably priced for their bigger dishes. It's a small, neighbourhood restaurant which wasn't too busy on a weekday night. Old, but homey style of decor.   I had the chicken greek salad and swapped the chicken for shrimp that they happily accommodated at no extra charge, which was great because normally I would be seeing an extra charge for a swap like that. The chicken greek salad is already $19 which I think is crazy for a greek salad, but the portion size is quite large as were the shrimp and I got 6-7 pieces. Big tip, ask for the dressing on the side as mine was unfortunately SWIMMING in dressing. I wasn't able to finish just because it was just too much. My cousin got the 12 oz. sirloin dinner. It came with salad, rice, veggies and baked potato. The sirloin and the potato were cooked well and the price was pretty affordable for the amount of stuff that came with the dish. She was able to save half for lunch the next day.   Server was polite and didn't rush us as we spent some time just sitting and chatting after we paid. Overall, it was okay. While I wasn't too impressed with the $19 overly dressed greek salad, maybe their pizza is where its at and I'll come back to give it a go."}
