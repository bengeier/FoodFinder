{"text":"Although I was sad to see Chautara go, I was eager to sample the fare of the space's new occupant, Crandall's, which offers Peruvian-American cuisine.  First, I have to say that \"Peruvian-American\" is used in the loosest possible sense of the term here, since you can order an appetizer of fried Wisconsin cheese curds...And I can't say that if I had a hankering for lasagna THIS would be the first place I'd come to look for it.  But there it is on the menu.    Our server was excellent, and the atmosphere was relaxed and nice--although the music selection, which included Bruno Mars, was somewhat disorienting.  I ordered the Arroz con Pollo, a very traditional Peruvian dish.  I was not expecting chicken and rice to make a grand entrance on an absolutely gorgeous plate, but that's what was laid in front of me.  I also appreciated the portion size, which was not overly large.  On first bite, the dish struck me as hearty and savory, but a tad on the bland side.  Peruvian cuisine is not as spicy as some other Latin American cuisines, after all, and as I kept eating, it suddenly hit me.  The pickled red onion garnish was there FOR A REASON.  So I assembled a forkful of rice, chicken, and a slice of the onion pickle.  The sheer perfection of that bite was amazing: the pickled onion provided a perfect textural counterpoint and highlighted the subtle flavors of the dish.  The insanely reeky onion breath two hours later was well worth it.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Get the pisco cocktails, sour but delicious. Also the steak saltado is wonderful"}
{"text":"Our evening at Crandalls was a big disappointment.  After making reservations for six and mentioning we had a one year old grandchild, we were met at the door with a surly manager \"oh, I'm sorry...we don't have a high chair and we really cater to adults.\"  We decided to try the restaurant anyway. Our mistake.  That manager marched around seemingly angry at everyone, us, the servers, etc.  Baby and mom left after 20 minutes, and went back to the hotel.  The rest of us waited over 50 minutes for appetizers and entrees followed a few minutes later.  When we asked that they box the Mom's order, the manager barked \"we weren't TOLD about this!\"  Our entrees arrived  lukewarm but some were good flavor.  When we finished eating, we needed to remind them we had a boxed meal, which took over 20 more minutes to arrive.  Also cold.  As we left we talked to the manager telling him that his attitude had ruined our evening. He blamed our servers and the chef.  To us, the most amazing thing is all the good reviews we read online beforehand.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped in spontaneously for dinner with my family. Not much bang for the buck. We ordered empanadas, paella, and pollo a la brasa. The empanadas were fair. The chicken was done well but overly simple. We ordered a full and were given 3/4 plus some extra thighs due to a kitchen shortage. The paella was sub-par for sure -- rubbery calamari, small portion, little protein. While the meal was average, the cost was much too high for the quality. The space was also chilly for us all and the tiny speaker blaring dance music was a major distraction. Would have been happy at 2/3 the price."}
{"text":"My husband is from neighboring Ecuador, and since there are just a few South American options in Madison, we took the opportunity to dine here recently while holiday shopping on State street.  Our meal was fantastic. We has ceviche mixto, Seco de Cordero, and alfajores for dessert. My husband felt a taste of home. The ceviche was fresh and perfectly spiced, the seco de Cordero had amazing texture and flavor, and the dessert was homemade and delicious.  I also had a pisco cocktail with infused basil. The server, also the catering manager, told us there are other unique cocktail options with pisco. These cocktails should absolutely not be missed.   Service was extremely friendly and attentive, and it was a busy night. The tables were all occupied and there was a private party upstairs (I believe we were told you can rent the room for an event free of charge with food).  I will go back, and my husband agrees! For previous folks who said there were American items on the menu, that was not my experience. It is now an entirely South American menu, and it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Food is excellent. Authentic Peruvian. Everything was made perfect. Highly recommend the ceviche Great patio to spend last days of summer outdoors"}
{"text":"I've never eaten in at Crandall's, only ordered from them via grubhub.com, so that's what I'm reviewing. The food is fine, but they have no idea what they're doing at the restaurant. I've ordered from them three times and will never order from them again. The first time I ordered from Crandall's, I realized that I had entered the wrong address in grubhub so I called the restaurant to let them know. They had no idea what grubhub was and insisted on rudely telling me I had the wrong restaurant. The second time I ordered from them, I got a call - after an hour of waiting for the food - saying that they were out of what I had ordered. The third time, they packaged my order wrong and I received the wrong food. When I called to ask them to send me the correct order, they insisted it was the delivery guy's fault. I have no idea what goes on at that restaurant, but it is terribly run. I've never had such bad service. I've never written a Yelp review before, but I'm so annoyed with them that I felt it merited a review."}
{"text":"So this restaurant is new to State Street here in Madison. Until a month or two ago it was a Himalayan restaurant. Not sure if Crandall's moved here from another location in Madison or whether it's completely new to Madison.   Anyway, we thought we'd give it a try today (a group of 4 of us). It really didn't impress us at all, as you can tell from the rating. In fact, it was downright disappointing. When you order something for $13, you don't expect to get something that tastes like something I can get for $6 at a local Chinese take-out. And I don't know if it was a bad day for them or what, but the wait was too long AND they couldn't offer us half the things on their menu. So... what DO you have to serve us today? You could count on one hand the options we had. After we got our food, it was really unimpressive for the price and setting. Our food was bland and didn't have much taste. The chicken was bland (\"Rotisserie chicken\" from the menu), the Quinoa dish was bland and tasted like chinese stir fry, the tofu version of the \"lomo\" dish was ok, and the steak version of the \"lomo\" dish was ok.  Really, really not worth anyone's time considering the amazing other restaurants surrounding it on State Street - and DEFINITELY not worth the money they're charging you for these dishes. In one word: \"meh\"."}
{"text":"New restaurant here!  I came here for lunch with a few colleagues.  Check out the attached photos.  They serve Peruvian food with some traditional american items on the menu.  (There was a regular burger on the menu).  Overall things were pretty good.  Great service, clean restaurant, and a nice feel.    The empanadas are really great.  Extra flaky.  I would suggest the cheese or chicken.  I had the steak sandwich.  I think it was called the Pan con Lomo.  It was pretty good, but could've used a bit more meat on it.  Fries were so-so.     Overall, I'd go back for sure.  There are plenty of other items that looked great!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Good service.  I'll be returning, often.  We ordered chicken empanadas as our appetizer.  The crusts were amazingly flaky, the chicken tender, and the aji Amarillo pepper sauce had a nice bite.  I'd go back just for those.  My lomo saltado featured tender saut√©ed hanger steak, red onions, and tomatoes in a nice sauce.  It was tasty comfort food.  The French fries that accompanied them reminded me of Red Robin (meh), but were an excellent medium for the remaining  delicious sauce that came with the empanandas.  The ceviche mixito my friend ordered was quite good.  I sampled a few tender morsels, and only one had a hint of \"fishy\" flavor.  The rocoto pepper leche de tigre leant everything a delightful burn."}
{"text":"I have never been to Crandalls before but for many years I had seen the cars lined up on the street in front of their Middleton location on Fridays with everyone going crazy over their famous fish fry.  My husband and I went on the first Friday of Lent.  The place is small but they had several tables opened. We ended up sitting in a booth.  The server was great, though she had only just been there for a week or so. She was friendly and a little quirky which made us comfortable.   I ordered their fish fry opting for the traditional.  My DH ordered the Paella.   I have had Fish Frys everywhere, some great some just ok.  It's not like its a complicated dish.  This one was just ok, actually not really because I wont' go back for it.  The breading on the small fish filets tasted odd to me, and the fries were not crisp at all as if they had been sitting under a warming light for awhile.  I didn't finish my meal and left still hungry.  I couldn't imagine that this is what people were waiting in a long drive thru line to get back at the old restaurant.   My husband has had paella several places, the best being of course at La Paella when it was still open.  This was nothing like paella.  It wasn't cheap, and it was basically a bowl of rice, and not even a big bowl.  There were a few token pieces of seafood on the top but nothing like it should have been for what we paid.    I like that they are trying something new for their restaurant, but sadly we won't be back.  There are many other options on State Street that offer better food for the money.  I gave 2 stars instead of one for our waitress, because she was fun.  The food was not fun."}
{"text":"My companion and I found Crandall's a delightful surprise.  The Argentinian wine that I chose was a perfect complement for our appetizer order of the flaky empanadas and amazing lamb entree that I had ordered.  My very discerning companion loved the ceviche.  To complete the meal, I had the key lime pie: Exquisite. I highly recommend Crandall's.  The waitstaff was attentive and very personable."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food that I had! My boyfriend however did not. He also did like my good food though, ended up eating his and mine. Our server was a little awkward however. We had the most delicious dessert here! It was cookies and ice cream, definetly would suggest"}
{"text":"Great tasting food with friendly and quick service. I'm docking them one star for not having a high chair for our baby! Hello!! We will come back again if they get a high chair."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very attentive, but the kitchen was extremely slow. The food wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Okay food some are tastier than others not really expensive but I don't know if worth the price. Before ordering ask if your food will be unbearably spicy if so then don't get it. Peruvian food is NOT spicy that you cannot taste and enjoy the flavor, but the \"cook\" claims that is how he makes it and he is from Peru. Well not true at all, I'm from Peru as well."}
{"text":"I went with my husband and 2 kids (2 and 5).  We ate outside.  The tables were tiny, and the tops wobbled, so we couldn't fix them by stabilizing the bases. The empanadas were good, flaky crust and tasty filling. My husband had a quinoa dish, which they forgot to add chicken to. I had a rice dish with chicken. It was ok, but very heavy with the oil. The kids split fried fish with fries. It was pretty good. The service was slow for a table with children, but it seemed like they were not used to having kids. The best part of the meal was the pisco sour."}
{"text":"Ordered the ceviche classico, the ceviche mixto, and the quinoa salad. The food was mediocre at best and the service was amateur. First they directed us to sit at a tiny table in the corner when the rest of the restaurant was virtually empty. I politely asked to be seated at bigger table and they obliged.   The chef must have burned something in the kitchen, because a few minutes after we arrived the entire restaurant was filled with smoke. Servers were acting like this was normal, while I coughed and sneezed because of the smoke. I eventually went outside to get a breath of fresh air.  The food arrived relatively quickly and it was just okay--nothing to write home about. The real disaster was the quinoa salad. After a few bites we discovered, after biting into something sharp, there were mussel shell shards in salad. Not one or two shards, but dozens. We called the waitress over to explain the issue, she looked disinterested and like she didn't understand why this was an issue. I couldn't believe that she didn't apologize or offer to take the salad off the check. She literally asked us if we were done with barely eaten salad! Totally clueless.  For such a pricey meal, I am very disappointed and will never be returning to Crandall's."}
{"text":"I am so sad to give this place only 3 stars, but I feel I have to based on the extremely slow service we received.  We stopped by for lunch on Saturday because we wanted to try something new.  We sat outside, along with another family who had children.  A lady came to take their drink order but never returned with their drinks and also never came to take our order or the other table's order either.  We waited a good 15 minutes before I went to say something.  During that time, I saw multiple tables walk out due to no service (not even menus were given to them).  There were only 3 tables at the time that already had their food; so, I am not sure what the hold up was.  As I was about to ask for service, a gentleman ran in and suited up for duty.  He was called in on his day off (poor guy!).  Thank goodness because otherwise we may never have gotten service.  He was friendly, prompt, and attentive and did a lot of damage control for us and the other table that was sitting outside.  The food was good.  I personally loved the empanadas and their french fries (nice and light and crispy).  The tamales were good, but I found them to be a little dry.  I did find the pricing to be on the steep side for what you got.  I feel that for the price I paid, I should not have left the restaurant hungry.  I guess it wasn't a horrible thing because we were in the midst of a bike excursion; so, I didn't end up being too full, despite being ravenously hungry when I arrived (and then getting hungrier as we waited for service).  I may try here again, just because I did enjoy the food.  I probably would not go back if I was looking for a large, filling meal.  Maybe if I need a light snack.  I just hope the service improves!"}
{"text":"After seeing all their awards I thought this place could actually be good. The service from the start was terrible. It took the waitress 15 minutes to seat us and the restaurant was dead. After that we weren't spoken to until maybe 15 more minutes after being seated when I finally asked a waitress if I could order. If you ever had the luxury of eating food in Per√∫ you would be greatly disappointed. The ceviche was terrible, basically raw fish with no flavor. They had no spark to their \"leche de tigre\" sauce for the ceviche, it was basically plain. Now, if you know anything about ceviche you would know it's that sauce that makes it. We heard a customer behind us complaining about the flavor of the ceviche as well. Pisco Sour flavor was good but I could not even taste alcohol in it. If you ever had a pisco sour in Per√∫ you would know these are full of alcohol. While eating, I also found a hair in my ceviche. The waitress didn't offer me a new plate or even offer to take the plate off my bill. The service was absolutely terrible all round, they definitely lack basic customer service skills. The food is... not anything like Peruvian food. Never again."}
{"text":"We walked in at 7:29pm on a Sunday with a sign on the door that said they closed at 8 pm. A woman sat us then about 5 min later a woman walks up to the table and told us they wouldn't serve us because they were closed. It has been some time since I had been to Peru, and I was really looking forward to some Peruvian food. After a brief exposure to the hospitality at this restaurant, I can tell you it was nothing like the hospitality in Peru, so I sincerely doubt the quality of their food is anything to talk about."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim for an early dinner with two kids. It was a little more expensive than we'd normally do with kids, but the food came quickly and was delicious. I had a quinoa pilaf with shrimp, my son had sweet potato fries (made from the Asian type of sweet potato that are white inside and not so sweet), and we all split a side of fried plantains. It was the best meal I've had out in quite a while. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Friendly service & large portions. Solid food. Nothing spectacular. Pisco Sours were big, but with large pieces of ice."}
{"text":"Came for dinner before an evening show at 730pm. Arrived around 6pm to a quiet restaurant but it filled up relatively quickly by 630pm.   Restaurant was nicely adorned with awards and Peruvians wall hangings. Potential patrons will look into the glass window before making an entrance so if you don't like people to look at what you are eating, choose an inside table. We choose the corner table near the windows.   Hindsight is always 20/20. That corner of the restaurant seems to be a fly magnet. All the flies congregated on that window to have a party. It was really bothering me. I wished the owner did something about it before opening.   Service was slow tonight. Someone called in sick and there was just a wait staff doing her best to cater to everyone. Those who choose to sit outside may experience slower service.   Food was alright. We had the chicken with potatoes with rice topped with a bit of hard boiled egg and olive. The taste was good. Not salty but the presentation seemed haphazard. The other dish we ordered was their seafood paella. Decoration was better, the two halves of a mussel look like ears or antennas. There were shrimps and squid rings and that 1 mussel. The shrimps and squid rings were on the small size. The taste was pleasant, again not salty so I like it. The rice was too mushy for me. I love the Peruvian beans, don't know what it is called, but not a fan of the green beans and diced carrots. They looked canned.   I will try their other dishes in the future since I like not so salty food and the portion is just right."}
{"text":"Some of the most flavorful food I've experienced in Madison so far! Generous portions, well balanced robust flavors, and a pleasant atmosphere...updated yet keeping to its roots. Our server was very sweet and was just the right amount of attentive. The yuca fries with the amazing huancaina sauce are a must. I had the Pescado A Lo Macho, so good it made me not just eat but love my peas. Amazingly seasoned and a hearty portion. My friend had the Steak Limo Saltado which he loved as well. The prices are a tad high, BUT for the portion sizes and comparing to the rest of Madison, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this place 3.5 stars but that is not an option for users (Yelp dev team get working on that!).   As someone who has lived their whole life in South America, I can say the menu at Crandall's is authentic Peruvian food. They have several staple dishes from Peru, like Arroz con Pollo, Arroz Chaufa, Lomo Saltado, Pan con Chicharron, Pollo Asado, and a few others.   I ordered the Pan con Chicharron (braised pork sandwich). It was satisfyingly good. It came with a good serving of peruvian style fries (thick cut fries) for a side. They carry imported beer from Peru and even Inca Kola, which is Peru's most popular soda. This totally adds to the experience! The food has great presentation but in my hungry state I forgot to take pictures, maybe next time.   The reason I'm giving it 3.5 stars is because the food was kind of pricey IMO. Latin american food is very simple, nothing fancy, so I think the food could be less expensive."}
{"text":"I ate lunch at Crandall's last week, and used the Hooked iPhone app to get a $6 meal.    While it was affordable, it unfortunately wasn't very good.  The rotisserie chicken was way overcooked and seriously lacking in flavor.  I couldn't eat some of the meat, as it was too chewy.  The garden salad on my plate was fine, just a pile of iceberg lettuce with red onions and carrots and dressing.  The thickly cut fries were easily the best part of my meal.  The $6 Hooked deal also includes a soda.  I had a nice yet slightly inattentive server.  Overall, a pretty underwhelming meal.  I'll perhaps try the dinner menu sometime to see if that provides a better experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and thought it was quite good both times. I got the classic civiche which was delicious. It isn't a fancy place and the floor wasn't level so our food slid ever so slightly to the left of the table as the meal went on, which was amusing. It's much quieter than a lot of places on state Street and our waitress was very nice. It's a good place to go for a quiet but tasty meal."}
{"text":"Fairly authentic tasting Empanadas, Ceviche and Aji de Gallina...  a little pricey for what you get though."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat in Madison. And we love a lot of places, so that's saying something. The Sunday brunch is flavorful and unique and the coffee is amazing. Their coffee is as good as, if not better than, any of the coffee shops in town.   If you want something a little different for a reasonable price. This is the place."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Crandall's. I have been here once when it was a takeout place in Middleton and once downtown. We sat outside on the patio since it was summertime and the experience/vibe was great. We came for the fish fry and also had some glasses of wine. Their fish fry is amazing, but I am now gearing up to try the Peruvian food. I love Peruvian food, so I look forward to checking this place out.  I will say I am hesitant to come here in the winter as the inside is a little small. The patio on State Street made for a great eating experience and I don't want to give that up, so we may wait til spring.  Overall, some of the best fish fry I have had."}
{"text":"We were very happy with the food and service. I got the lamb which was excellent and my husband got the tacu tacu which was also amazing. We are excited to go back."}
{"text":"It was really nice to experience Peruvian food for the first time. The staff was extremely friendly and the food was pretty tasty.  We were on our way to a show and our waiter got us our check quickly when asked.  Our appetizer was forgotten, which I was a bit bummed about, but the main dishes were served promptly and tasted good."}
{"text":"First  Peruvian experience and it was  fabulous. Our waiter (big guy- didn't catch his name unfortunately) was wonderful. He answered all our questions with ease and elegance. He was funny and interactive. I had the Lomo Saltado and it was filling, flavorful, and large portion. Another person in the party had the Pisco Sour and it's a good thing we share - we both loved our drinks. I would definitely come back if I ever make it to Madison again."}
{"text":"The flavors are definitely correct and authentic at this Peruvian restaurant, down to the chicha morada drink. The ceviche tasted fresh, and the empanadas were tasty. The service was a bit lax, but not to the point of being problematic. Not an absolute A-lister among the Madisonian foodie greats, but absolutely worth returning to when craving Peruvian food."}
{"text":"Ok food at great food prices. The Pisco Sour was good, the Seafood Paella was below average with frozen veggies, rubbery calamari and average shrimp.  Service was not good, but I can look past that because it was busy.   For the price, I doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"I have an undying love of Peruvian food, and Lomo Saltado is definitely in my top #5 favorite dishes of all time. Since Peruvian restaurants in my own hometown are hard to come by, checking out Crandall's was an absolute necessity while I was in Wisconsin.  Lots of variety to be found on the menu with Peruvian Dishes but also with a smattering of Classic American fare as well including Roast Turkey, Pot Roast, and even Pasta Primavera. I love ceviche too, and they have a handful of those to choose from but I had to stick to my guns and get the Lomo Saltado with Steak.   I liked the crispy fries, and the steak was marinated well and had a nice depth of flavor. However, the steak was also very overdone, and very tough. There was also wayyy too little steak to justify the $17 price tag! It was mostly fries and rice!  Our waiter was attentive and friendly but we were also the only patrons in the restaurant at the time so that might also have something to do with it. The restaurant smells heavily of incense too, so keep that in mind if you're adverse to strong smells while dining. Although I finally got my hands on some Lomo Saltado, it wasn't as satisfying as I'd hoped it would be. My friend got the Seafood Paella and really enjoyed her food. It looked good too! Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but with so many other great dining options in Madison to choose from, I wouldn't waste my time coming back to find out."}
{"text":"The empanadas were quite good as was my rice and chicken dish (Arroz con Pollo). The Lomo Saltado was disappointing.   They automatically add gratuity to parties of 4 or more."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice, and both the times I did not find a reason to complain or be disappointed. With regards to food, I dont know which is worse. So, the first time I was here I ordered the Loma Saltado with tofu. My dish that day, though good was a tad bit acidic (could be the balsamic or any other vinegar that was used). The dish though flavorful, was not something I would come back to again. However, on my second visit (with my husband) we went through most of the menu. We got a Chicha Morada, (some regular beer), the Vegetable and Cheese Empanadas, Loma Saltado (again!, for the hubby) and the Arrozo con Pollo (without chicken, but with tofu instead).  The Arrazo was absolutely delicious! The cilantro sauce (without beer) subtly enhanced the carrots and green peppers in the dish. Fragrant and full of flavor and a lovely color, this dish is certainly a winner! I would come back for this! The Saltado was as expected, OK! nothing to complain about (the tartness being accounted for), but nothing to praise either!. I would skip the Empandas!(buy them off the food cart for half the price and twice the taste). On the whole, our dining experience was good, with the Arrazo emerging as the hero of our dinner! Go back for the Arrazo! Forget everything else and bite into the cilantro goodness :).   The dishes were a bit pricey too, with the exception of the Arrazo. I would certainly pay the $15 asked for taste and the portion. This is a 4 star review with 1 star exclusively for the Arrazo.   Go ahead and give Crandall's a try, I would go back only for the Arrazo though!."}
{"text":"The food here is great and my significant other and I have had several dishes over several visits and loved them all.  However, we had a very disappointing and deceptive recent visit and will not be back.  On this visit, we arrived well after the lunch rush on Saturday and found the restaurant less than half full.  The service was very slow, especially processing our payment (two people, one card) which took over 30 minutes and was only completed after we literally put on our coats and stood by the door.  Needless to say, we were very disappointed by the service. However, the biggest surprise came when we examined our check.  We were charged a mandatory 18% tip, which is only supposed to be used for tables of 4 or more people.  We were also charged $14 for a brunch item which was listed as $12 on the menu. Last but definitely not least, the amount shown on our credit card statement was $2.50 more than the final amount signed for on our receipt. We will be pursuing reimbursement with Crandall's.  Since other reviews have mentioned this practice, it's unlikely that this was a mistake or isolated instance.  It's a shame because the food is really good and unique in the Madison food scene but the slow service and borderline fraudulent billing practice make Crandall's a place that we won't return."}
{"text":"Overall a very pleasant food/drink experience. The first Pisco Sour was better than the second. The appetizer was better than the Paella entr√©e. The seafood was over-cooked and had a very tobacco taste. I am not much of a dessert fan, so I could have done without. But really it was a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I bet you're sleeping on this place because of its low review volume and location next to all the college bars, but you're missing out on some seriously tasty food. I don't have too much to say about Crandalls except that it's a solid place for dinner that serves food that you won't find anywhere else in downtown Madison.  I tried two of their dishes: seafood paella and steak tallerin verde.  The seafood paella is somewhat better than ok. It's flavorful and packed with seafood. This dish simultaneously reminds me of Chinese fried rice and Spanish paella. I like how the rice is not soggy , but the grains themselves just aren't as fat as I'd like them to be. Maybe that's only a Spanish paella thing though; I have no idea. Whether or not this is intentional, the seafood paella serves as a reminder that Peruvian food was born from Inca roots with heavy European and Asian influence from immigrants.  The tallerin verde is awesome. I know it just sounds like a pesto fettucini dish, but the flavor will really surprise you. It's not the bright and herbal pesto that you may be used to; it has a darker, earthier, and more mysterious flavor. This creamy, unique sauce combined with extremely tender, charred beef slices and thick, satisfying fettuccini noodles makes for a terrific comfort food dish. I truly think that this dish is a hidden gem in a town known for its burgers, beer, and cheese curds. Oh yeah; it also comes with some kind of potato.  I should also mention that while the menu prices can be high here and there, the large portions sort of make up for it. Eating a big plate of tasty Peruvian food in their outdoor State street seating on a nice day makes for a solid dinner experience. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Our foursome met here on a quiet Tuesday night. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Although he had been there only a week, he was knowledgeable And when he didn't know a term he asked for clarification from the chef.  The food was beautifully presented and quantity generous. I ordered the ceviche which is not the cilantro and lime juice version to which I am accustomed. It was interesting, but heavier on vegetables rather than seafood. They serve only beer and wine and need to do some serious beefing up of both of these lists. The IPA dark, intense brew drinkers in our group were NOT happy. Wine selections were marginal. And it wouldn't hurt to put some fresh flowers or candles on the table. The crisp white cloths and napkins with the large front windows are begging for them."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and good atmosphere. We found this new restaurant while walking down State Street and the waiter who caught us eyeing the menu was so friendly and enthusiastic we had to sit down and try it out. And we were definitely not disappointed. The fried quinoa was awesome! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We stopped in after our movie at the Wisconsin Film Festival. They were not expecting a crowd on this usually slow Sunday night.  Only one waiter and he was overwhelmed.  My 1/2 chicken was pretty good but the wedge fries were lukewarm and soft.  Wine pours were small.  My wife's entree was unacceptable and the waiter took it off the bill."}
{"text":"I had a post symphony dinner here with a friend early on a Sunday evening. The place is about as close and convenient to The Overture Center as one can get, and I was just curious about a place with both \"Crandall's\" and \"Peruvian\" in the name. I wonder if there is a Gonzalez Gaelic place somewhere in South America.  Seating was easy this time of day on Sunday, and we were greeted promptly by both the host and by our server. We took advantage of one of the Peruvian cocktails, the Pisco, and that turned out to be a good choice. It's similar to a Margarita but much less sweet and still pungent with lime goodness. I would highly recommend it.  The menu is just right in terms of choices and it offers the expected ceviches, rice and meat and seafood combinations one might encounter in South American cuisine. It reminds me quite a bit of Columbian fare, without the emphasis on beef dishes. There are however, a couple of tantalizing steak offerings which I will need to check out another time. I chose the Mahi mahi, which was a generous piece of sweet and fresh baked fish, with a sauce which included some mussels and shrimp. Accompanied by rice. My companion ordered the Arroz Con Pollo, which was mostly arroz with poco pollo. It was a 3-4 ounce grilled breast portion. I would have expected a little mas pollo, but the dish and especially the rice was very well-seasoned. I believe it was basmati rice-my favorite.  Our server was friendly and attentive, but for some reason our service was rushed (with the bill coming when we barely finished.) Otherwise, on balance the dining experience here met with expectations for good ethnic fare in a pleasant environment. And it was a good value. The bill was around $54.00 for two with two drinks. I will definitely be back because I'm just a sucker for delicous \"Arroz con Cosas,\" and kicky, flavorful sauces."}
{"text":"Intimate environment with a nice shortage of college kids. Beef empanadas were really good. I tried a piece of the beef heart but it just isn't my thing. I had the chicken aji and it was well balanced, filling and delicious. Wife had the chicken which was great, the fries sucked and seemed like an odd choice given the theme. Overall I liked it a lot. Beer & wine only, Sangria was good."}
{"text":"Probably great for the area but I've had much better Peruvian. The staff is absolutely amazing as well as attentive to your dining needs. Establishment is clean and food came out fast and a good temperature. I just missed a few staples on the menu."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Crandall's to get Pisco Sours a week ago. The waitress was funny and courteous. She described some other Peruvian food that was special called tacu tacu (I think) and my friend had lomo. We thought the tacu tacu was delicious and unusual. It made me want to try more Peruvan food.   We will be back to try the Ceviche."}
{"text":"Okay but pricey food, inappropriate check experience. Be aware and check your bank statement, for you may be overcharged!!!  We went there on a busy Thursday night before a show, it was the only place nearby that was not packed with customers  (should have rung a bell). We love Peruvian food, so decided to give it a try.  There was only one waiter working at the time, who was nice and accommodating to our needs. We were quite happy with him until he gave us a check with 18% tip already included, even though the check indicates that this kind of tip is mandatory for 4+ group only, and we were only a group of 2. (And no, it is not a suggested tip, the final number have the tip included.) It made us very uncomfortable, but we were in a hurry and were planning to give him almost the same amount of tip anyway, so we ignored this inappropriateness and left.   Then, a few days later, I was checking my bank statement, and realized that they charged 3.5 dollars more than what I put down on the check - even after making sure you paid 18% tip, they still want more! I guess people rarely do this kind of checking, and I highly doubt that I was the only \"lucky\" one they tried to pull this kind of scheme on. I contacted the bank and got refunded through a dispute. So, If you are reading this review, please be sure to check yours, too!  P.s. The interior design is not very pleasant at night-time with very dim light. Definitely don't recommend if you go on a date."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Waitstaff was very cool and knowledgeable about answering our questions, even the obscure ones about where an ingredient comes from. Try the purple corn drink!"}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised. Excellent food, wine and service. Good Colombian  - but definitely Latin.  Actually was impressed by watching a waiter run out across state street (in bitter cold) after a couple had left a pair of glasses on their table. Good kid - and our waitress (Holly) was great as well.  One suggestion for menu (based on Latin restaurant experience in Houston - see Churrascos - known for Venezuela - Venezuelan specialties) as an Appetizer: Add Fried Plaintain (banana) chips with a sweet Mango salsa (but not runny - and sweet/tangy with just a little bite at the end). - It is unbelievably popular.....and so good. Try it.  The Tres Leches dessert was excellent - good job of caramelizing (request) the top for me.  Excellent wine suggestions to go along with the meal. Will come again next time in Madison on State St."}
{"text":"First off; the name is the same as the former American takeout&catering service in Middleton, but almost everything else has changed.  About 80% of the food is Peruvian-inspired, there are just a few Americana options (turkey dinner, fish fry, 1 pasta dish, pot roast).  Crandall's accommodated a group of 6 pressed for time before an Overture Center show without a hitch.  The server was extremely helpful and polite and ensured we were served quickly, yet didn't feel pressed for time. Our party selected Peruvian dishes, which including ceviche (multiple types), chaufa de quinoa (Peruvian \"fried rice\" except with quinoa), lomo saltado (steak, veggie, french fry dish).    Everyone loves choclo, the roasted giant corn kernels served as a snack before ordering, and ceviche usually appeals to anyone who likes fresh fish.  Overall the sauces such as aj√≠ (onion condiment) adds a brighter element so even the heartier dishes like lomo saltado don't make you feel as heavy when you're finished.  The prices are all right-they seem dead on for ceviche, but the chaufa de quinoa, which is borrowed from fried rice, is a wee bit overpriced.  Our group was happy with our experience here, and we would return, especially as a good option prior to an event downtown."}
{"text":"worst Peruvian food I've ever had.  nothing was good.  i can't even start as i didn't finish my meal here.  i just asked for the check, paid and left."}
{"text":"Was a very nice place with a good variety of healthy breakfast/ brunch stuff. Got the veggie quinoa skillet and was pretty good. All of us enjoyed our meal except that the service was pretty bad. It took them about an hour to get us our food. It was a long long wait for food, that got us a little impatient. But, the people serving were pretty nice and got is free juices and drinks.   In general, the food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with how delicious and wonderful this place was! Walked in just after 9pm unsure of how late they were open.. Treated great even though closing time was near (I think!) The yuca was very good and the sangria was AMAZING! Overall great experience! Large portions made for great leftovers and another meal the next day!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Crandall's with my friends for dinner and drinks. Their menu options range widely in reguard to price, flavors, and portions, so there's really something for everyone. I usually get steak tacu-tacu or steak pan con lomo. I've tried a few other items on their menu and I've never been disappointed. My friends and I enjoy their Pisco Sours to drink (they're sort of like margaritas but they don't use Tequila and are frothy on top). Music is nice, ambiance is very pleasant, and servers are very accommodating. I plan on continuing to go here regularly."}
{"text":"I was in town on business today and wasn't certain what to eat.  Took a walk down State St to see what grabbed my eye.  You don't see Peruvian restaurants everywhere so I thought 'what the heck'.  Great decision!  The waiter was a sweetheart and guided us around the menu.  She gave us three recommendations.  There were three in the party so we each took one.  I went with the Seco de Cordero which was excellent and filling.  I would've grabbed dessert but I was stuffed.  They were offering $5 sangrias tonight which were awesome.  I would've had a few based on the taste and the price but they were so good I don't think I would've stopped.  Highly recommended"}
