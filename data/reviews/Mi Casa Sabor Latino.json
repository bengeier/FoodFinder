{"text":"Don't let the location intimidate you, this place, while small (only 3 tables currently inside to eat at, they do a booming carryout business) is big on taste.  I had the bacalao salad, which you just can't get most places, it was not overly salty or fishy tasting.  The cod was firm and the other ingredients were fresh and yummy.  The beef stew I mixed in with my rice and beans was so very good.  My dining companions raved about the pig's feet (not for me) and the steak was rated as \"way good.\"  Nothing tasted old, overly salted or so highly spiced you couldn't enjoy it.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Puerto Rican food here in Lorain OH! They've been featured on Channel 8 news out of Cleveland! We had the pollo guisado, steak and onions, papas rellenas, rice and beans, and mofongo with pork! The owner Ramon' brought us out a special treat only made here....Yucalou (cassava and cod fish) The hubby can't stop raving about the flavor of the pork!!! But everything was fantastic! The owner is awesome! You can tell he loves what he does. When mom is doing the cooking, you can't go wrong!!! When in Lorain, get here for your Puerto Rican food!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food here, with friendly service in a small, no frills carry out place with 3 or 4 tables.  There is a steady flow of regulars coming in to get some conversation and food to go.

All the food prepared ahead and is kept warm in trays behind the counter.  No menu is posted, so just go to the counter and ask what they have.  You'll find slow braised meats and stews, beans, rice and some deep fried filled doughs.

This is comfort food, good and flavorful, not spicy, but they do have fresh sauces you can add if you want some heat.  Try the green sauce! Just the beans and rice with some sauce is really good.

I was a really disappointed with the rice though.  It tasted great, but after sitting in the warming tray uncovered, MANY of the grains were dry and I spent the next 30 minutes trying to pick them out of my molars.

It's a little pricey for the amount and quality of food you get, but the authentic flavors make Mi Casa stand out."}
{"text":"Best Puerto Rican food in town! Daily specials are definitely worth trying even if you aren't familiar with it. Pork is always juicy and seasoned perfectly. Rice and beans are out of this world. It is family owned and operated by very friendly folks that put quality and customer service first. Try it and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"The food speaks for itself. Everything in here is phenomenal and it's the epitome of mom and pop style Puerto Rican food. Nothing fancy or foofy, just straight up good food. My kind of place"}
{"text":"Food is awesome.  Huge quantities and authentic like Momma cooked it.  Great selection"}
{"text":"Best Puerto Rican food in the area by far. Authentic, big portions, and delicious. Pernil is my favorite Puerto Rican dish so of course it is my go-to but everything on their menu is a hit. Skip on rainbow or el kefon."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I wouldn't spend another red cent here. Their food is greasy and cold.  The quality of the food seemed old. As if it sat around for days."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a long time and I absolutely wasn't disappointed. I took the family there on a lazy Saturday. We were greeted by who I think was the owner as soon as we walked in. He was very friendly and gave us a complete rundown of everything he had available.
    We got 2 giant dinners for ten bucks apiece, a steak dinner with onions and a pork dinner, Puerto Rican classics. Each came with rice and beans and each was big enough to feed one person twice. 
    We decided to eat there despite the small dining room. The food was absolutely incredible. Very very moist and tender, a very impressive accomplishment considering the food's served cafeteria style. We fed my 18 month old daughter pork with rice and beans. She kept screaming \" NUM! NUM!\" and grabbing at the plate trying to feed herself faster than we could. I was smiling and bobbing my head to merengue music the entire meal. I was so impressed I bough another pork dinner for later.
    In the Lorain Elyria area it is really hard to find great food and I'm really glad we finally made it out here. If you decide to go do not be intimidated by the location, the food is worth it. It really is a diamond in the rough. I can't wait to get hungry again so I can eat the leftovers. We will definitely be back sooner than later.
                                        5 STARS!"}
