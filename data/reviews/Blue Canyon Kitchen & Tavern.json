{"text":"Brought my Mom for Mother's Day dinner. I would actually probably give this a 4 1/2 stars if I could. The food was delicious and the atmosphere is lovely. We started with cocktails, a Gold digger for me and a sparkling Sangria for a couple of others and some wine. They have a nice selection of drinks and wines.  For an appetizer we had the Shrimp Casino Flatbread. At first I thought it was a little pricey for a flatbread appetizer until it arrived at the table. It was huge. Easily the size of a pizza. There were four of us and we had 2 pieces left. It was very good. The shrimp were a nice delicate pink, not overcooked at all and the bacon had a sweet maple flavor that was surprisingly good with the shrimp. They also served soft, warm rolls before dinner with a really nice herb butter. For our entrees we  had two at the table that had the beef tenderloin, one who had the bacon crusted pork chop and I had the sea scallops. I cannot rave enough about the scallops. They were large and perfectly seared with a love char on the outside and a soft center. They were wonderfully sweet and the smoked tomato corn butter was to die for. Really really good. You could smell the wonderful sweet corn aroma when the plate was set down and it paired so well with the scallops. I highly recommend. My companions all enjoyed their meals as well.  For dessert we split the BC Smores. Another hallelujah moment. It's not a traditional smore but instead had a  peanut crust  and peanut mixed with the chocolate. The homemade marshmallow was the a first for me and so much better than traditional store bought marshmallow. Much less sweet. I had only 2 small issues which keep me from giving the experience a fifth star - we sat in the small room adjacent to the bar that is enclosed in glass and the views were so lovely, but the tables are too close together. You really feel like you are dining with the tables on either side of you. The removal of even one table in each row would offer a little more privacy. The chairs are also very low. It was a little jarring when we first sat down. My mom is only 5 feet tall and she found the seat a little low for the table.
All in all it was a wonderful experience. The service was top notch. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local restaurants.  My family and I have been going here for years and enjoy both the food and atmosphere.  The restaurant is situated on a hill and consists of a lodge, along with a large outdoor patio area.  Inside is warm and inviting.  

My favorite dish is the lobster mac-&-cheese.  The calamari with sweet ginger sauce is great for a starter."}
{"text":"I'd give this restaurant a 3.5 to 4.

The service was very slow, which was frustrating, but the food was decent. An interesting mix of made-from-scratch and pre-prepared/machine-made, somewhere between almost-chic and quickie home cooking. 

The cream cheese pesto tapenade with white beans was refreshing and tasty. The accompanying bread was, too, though I could tell that it wasn't homemade bread because of the way the very thin, soft (almost same consistency as inside of bread) \"crust\" settled after it cooled in temperature. It was one of those rolls that you get pre-packaged and stick in the oven for quick prep.

I ordered a half portion of the lobster mac and cheese, which was presented well-- just right in proportion and aesthetically pleasing. Yet there was something amiss about the dish- the texture of the onion seems to clash with the overall texture of the dish, and the lobster could've used some sauteeing or more advance preparation to take away some of the bitter crustacean fishy-flavor. It wasn't the freshest/tastiest lobster (though I do commend them for not skimping on the lobster portion).

Overall, decent experience, but somewhere between a 3.5 and a 4. It would impress the average diner but wouldn't pass for a culinary snob."}
{"text":"For the money it's just meh. The waitstaff was super nice though. The decor is nice, warm fireplace with a rustic feel. The appetizers were good. Nice beer on tap. But.... The main course was crap for the price paid."}
{"text":"Brunch is wonderful. Have been here twice for brunch. Staff is extremely friendly, food is good! Beautiful views. Really enjoy coming here! Can not wait to try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"We were told it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait when we arrived. Fifty minutes later we were told it would be another 15 to 20 minutes. The restaurant was busy but that's ridiculous. We walked out with our three hungry kids in tow. The hostess called the owner over who did nothing but introduce himself and say goodbye."}
{"text":"The brunch is to not be missed, beef tenderloin , smoked salmon, shrimp, oysters with made to order entrees in an upscale rustic setting. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I am staying at the hotel next door and stopped in for a quick pint and some dinner.   The beer selection was not bad, service was A+.   Grabbed a chicken caesar salad to go. 

The salad was a good bit smaller than one would expect for $18..   but more importantly, I *really* didn't expect the chicken to have bones in it!

I'm in town for several more days, but I'll be eating somewhere else..."}
{"text":"In town for a business meeting in Hudson, and staying at the Hilton Garden Inn across the street. The interior of the restaurant is really nice; they did a great job with the space. Our server was very nice and friendly.

The menu and drink list was pretty intriguing, and we were excited to order our drinks and dinner. Unfortunately, the drinks were very weak both in strength and size, and the food, while tasty, came in unbelievably small portions. We were extremely disappointed, especially for the price. Won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Food great, waitress great, atmosphere exceptional. Upon walking into the restaurant, we were initially greeted by a rude, overwhelmed hostess - not a great first impression. Thankfully, the rest of the night was worth the hundred+ dollar check."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  Went to celebrate my birthday and they were amazing.  Service was wonderful and they even took a picture of us to remember the night.  They sent it to us via mail and it was a nice photo.  Love the atmosphere of the place very cozy and warm.  Food is excellent and the server was very knowledgeable about what they offered."}
{"text":"Just OK, but somewhat overpriced.  Love the interior and view.  Patio is great.  Menu could be updated.  Food quality has been uneven over the years.  Occasionally the food is over salted."}
{"text":"Just went to the Mothers Day brunch and was extremely disappointed. $40 per person for overcooked eggs Benedict, had to send it back twice, tasteless desserts and overall banquet hall quality food.  3rd time to this restaurant and will never go back. Disappointed every time we go."}
{"text":"We had a family brunch here today. Superb service, nice ambiance, really solid food. Very family-friendly, although those without kids could easily tuck away in a quiet booth and ignore the kiddos. Brunch buffet was lovely. Good seafood selection, plenty of well-made pastries (so many buffets use pre-made stuff - this stuff tasted fresh and homemade). The only tiny complaint I have is it would have been nice to have some healthier choices like more fruit, yogurt, etc. Overall, this is a wonderful place for a special Sunday morning with family and friends. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for a pre-wedding celebration with my bridal party. The service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive we received food and drinks very quickly. I had the crab cakes and Yukon chips appetizer and the lamb shank for my meal. The food was all delicious and left nothing to be desired. The other members of my groups were also happy with their meals as well. Overall, this place was excellent and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere I've dined here many times and never disappointed they steaks are the best eat inside or out on the patio.  The blue cheese chips are a great start and the chocolate bombs are the bomb."}
{"text":"I've been there twice.  First time was good, not incredible.  Calamari was however what brought us back.  The second visit was for my wife's birthday and we were there while the place was not busy, yet we were sat in a strange place, a table in a high traffic area.  THen the food was less than average.  Even the calamari wasn't as good as we remember it.  My chicken was very bland.  Margarita was expensive and lousy.

Doubtful that we'll be back."}
{"text":"We 'found' this place on a road trip through northern Ohio -- wanted to stay outside of Cleveland, so picked Twinsburg -- then looked for food.  Great ambiance - felt like we were in a western national park lodge! - and great food.  Adequate wine list (not enough California wine, for our taste! (smile))"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Prices are a bit high, but everything, even the wild game is fresh and brought in daily."}
{"text":"Very pretty place inside and out.  Unfortunately the service and food quality are lacking."}
{"text":"Called ahead , host recommend a high bar table since there where a long wait, got there for our resv.  and got a great table , food  was great, i had the 16oz steak wife had a 10oz, our server was the best knowledgeable of the menu and specials . Will be back again to try some GAME  meat when we get the nerve ."}
{"text":"Superb...
From the view approaching the restaurant, the welcome at the door and the food was phenomenal. Can't say anything else"}
{"text":"Once we got over fact that their advertisement was incorrect, and we couldn't have a clambake, we enjoyed our meal. The braised short ribs were excellent. Service good and a nice selection of desserts."}
{"text":"It was Saturday night when I just search the yelp for a restaurant and I pick it up on arrival at the entrance the vault parking was ready to take the car when we get in they adj the usual Q do you have reservation ? So I said No and I thought that my waiting time will be at least 30 min but I get really surprised when she asked how many kids menu and with in 15 min I was seated in nice table with high chair for my kid 
It was wonderful experience ad there special menu for 30$  only good value the biscuit lobster was so good the spice and gradient then the food did not take long time we where seated close to the kitchen so we can see how is the perpetration really fast efficient staff and the fish dish was huge portion delicious I want to finish it but I prefer to keep a space for the dessert which was so good. In the beginning I thought it is not a family friendly restaurant but I was wrong as my kids enjoy coloring with there menu and they treat them nicely.
My next visit for sure I will try to set in other area as the restaurant had many section."}
{"text":"Won't honor happy hour pricing while seated at 5:59p or 6:00p despite the menu stating that happy hour is from 4-6pm. Their computer \"changes pricing\" at 5:55p. If that's true, sounds like false advertising."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and I have hosted business dinners before. Tonight's dinner disappointed and I'm afraid it is a trend of dropping performance. We had a 7:45 Friday reservation and the restaurant had already out of the fish special and dessert special! Wine glasses were not clean and water service non existent. All this at a premium price- no wonder it wasn't busy. Three strikes and this place is out!"}
{"text":"I have never been to this restaurant,  but I have met the owner on several occasions.   The food must be fantastic, because each encounter I have with the owner he is always shouting \"Do you know who I am?\"  If the food wasn't great I am sure he would be nicer to the people of Twinsburg.  My experience with the owner gas truly been 5 star.  He is so important he can't get off of his phone to yell at you!  I can't wait to try the food!  I would treat his wait staff with the same curtsy that he has shown the people of Twinsburg over the years, but I am afraid that I am not important enough to act in such a manor."}
{"text":"We went  there today for the first time. We won't go back. The fruit flies drove me crazy. They did not seem to care, in fact they made light of it and joked about it. My scallops tasted like ammonia. I have been wanting to go there for years, it was not worth the drive or money."}
{"text":"Blue Canyon always sounds, on paper, like a great place to celebrate an event with a nice dinner. However, every time I leave the restaurant, I think, \"That was good, but not worth the price.\" I have tried several things on the menu and they are are all good, but I have never had a \"great\" meal there. I am yet to try the patio, which looks like one of the best in the city. I will plan on trying it soon and will review again after!"}
{"text":"To wind (or is it wend?) your way up to the top of the hill, though it overlooks a Hilton Garden Inn and a Bob Evans, is both fun and symbolic.  Better done after dark, as the twinkling blue lights could make you think you were overlooking - a canyon!

Brandt Evans definitely has his ducks in a row, cuisine-wise, and there's a great Western vibe here, from the lodge pine A-frame great room, to the cool bar that's always hopping with a good group for all ages, to the side dining rooms with big picture windows a la national park lodges.

The difference between them and Blue Canyon is the food - aahhhhh.  The menu is not huge, but that's OK, because whatever you order will be mahvelous.  Pasta - salmon - chardonnay - salads - creme brulee.  Mwah!  Perfection!  

Amy our waitress made the evening extra special, as super servers have a habit of doing."}
{"text":"We went here for their Clam Bake at the end of October. It was supposed to be unlimited sides with a dozen clams. Our waiter was an older gentleman who rushed us through our meal and never let us get the chance to ask for seconds of the amazing clam chowder soup. We also had a horrible fruit fly problem at our table and were literally swatting them away throughout our dinner. When we alerted our waiter, he just replied that yes, there are fruit flies. He also commented on us buying a bottle of wine, chastising with \"That's an entire bottle you know. I guess you can re-cork it when you leave.\"  I am only giving it 3 stars because the food was great. Everything else was strange and the fruit flies really killed the experience. I wrote up a \"comments card\" detailing all of the above but no one ever contacted me. For what we spent, I expected better service."}
{"text":"One of my favorites restaurants in the world they have great decorations and great service and food great artwork and very cool ice sculptures and great view of a the town"}
{"text":"I have dined at blue canyon many times in the past. I have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere, so I booked a dinner there with my family. First, let me say that I don't object to paying a higher price for a truly excellent restaurant, and I understood this to be the case here.  My problem was with the portions I received. I ordered a side house salad which was almost non existent. No joke. The next course was Airline Chicken which is a strange name for a grilled chicken quarter which is a chicken breast with a drumette leg flipped up in the air.  When my meal was served I was surprised to see a chicken leg with a small section of the thigh only.  I had a very meager portion of potatoes and asparagus along with it. I was very disappointed with the entire meal, and could not justify the price at all. Sorry to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing evening at Blue Canyon. First, when I made the reservation I specified that we'd like to sit on the patio. I was told it was first come, first serve, but they would note it on our reservation.  When we arrived on this beautiful Sunday evening, we were told that the patio isn't open on Sundays....what?  The explanation we were given was that the person who had taken our reservation was new. 

We were then seated in a cavernous room, air conditioned enough that we had to go back to the car for sweaters. My father in law was looking forward to ordering scallops, which he had had, and very much enjoyed, about a month ago.  However, we were informed scallops are not on their summer menu (he must have had them as a special). Note that scallops do appear on the Yelp menu online, along with several other entrees that are not actually available 


I ordered a cod special, but requested whipped potatoes and green beans instead of the orzo and asparagus sides. My meal came out with...orzo and asparagus. I told the sever I had requested different sides, so she returned a couple minutes later and told me they replated my entree with the correct sides. Fine, except both the beans and potatoes were lukewarm at best. My mother in law also said her potatoes were not hot.  My husband later informed me that it looked like a $5 up-charge was added to our bill for changing my sides?  Shouldn't the waitress inform me that my special request was an extra charge??  

Several times during our meal our waitress disappeared for long stretches (leaving us with empty drink glasses, etc.). I don't think this was her fault...I think the restaurant was understaffed and she was covering too many tables at one time. 

Overall, to spend well over $200 for a meal that was mediocre in taste, with slow, inconsistent service, while sitting inside on a beautiful August evening, is not my idea of a great, or even good dining experience. 

This was definitely my last meal at Blue Canyon."}
{"text":"I was in there on Friday June 3rd and like always the food was amazing. We ordered key lime cheesecake to go. I noticed some white fuzzy stuff on top of the blueberry when they brought us the cheesecake but I didn't think anything of it. I thought maybe its just some of the whipped topping. I got home and opened the container and it was not. It was mold starting to form on top of the blueberry that had started to go on to the whipped topping as well. Did anyone else there order the key lime cheesecake that night?"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood dishes. Well worth the money. Friendly staff and warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not a good value. Ate at bar, which wasn't busy on a Thursday night. Ordered sirloin mid rare and filet medium.  Steaks arrived filet medium rare and sirloin medium with a push. Bartender seen conferring with manager but manager did not engage with us. Bartender appears to be disgruntled with profession, employment and customer interaction. This will be our last visit. Food and service used to be so much better."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch. I've not had the pleasure of dining here for dinner but the Sunday brunch is delectable! It wasn't crowded and service was exemplary. The waiter is attentive and took the time to show us around the buffet since we were first timers. Some may think that paying $28 for brunch is expensive for Ohio but the delicious food and quality service are worth the extra bucks. I recommend it without reservation."}
{"text":"We came to Blue Canyon for dinner with a group of 10, and we had a great experience!  The interior decor of the restaurant is truly unique- I felt like I was in a resort at the Grand Canyon!  It's a little pricey, but the food does not disappoint!  I started off with a hot apple cider, and it was the right choice.  Fort starters, we ordered some flatbread pizzas, homemade potato chips with bleu cheese, lobster bisque (definitely get), and a baked cheese with bread.  We definitely had too much.  The complimentary rolls and housemate butters were awesome, too.  For my main dish, I had the salmon, which was served on a cedar plank and had a special root beer glaze.  It was some of the best salmon I've ever had.  The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  On a busy night expect to park in the hotel parking lot."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my father last week. Outstanding! Service was spot on, our meals were amazing. Would recommend this to all friends and family. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Blue Canyon on several occasions.  Love the food and the dining room is amazing.  Always love to get the Lobster Nacho's or the Lobster Bisque.  Great food and a Great atmosphere.  Like the Bar as well but need to start spending more time there.  Problem is if your in the Bar and you smell the food, you then have to Dine in there.

{"text":"Loved it!! Or waitress was outstanding and the food was great.  I love the jazz, it makes it so relaxing. The food is all homemade and tastes delicious."}
{"text":"You can seriously never go wrong with the Blue Canyon. I have been going here for years with my family, and the food is always so delicious. And, to my pleasant surprise, they just updated their menu! While they did keep some \"classic\" signature dishes, such as the lobster linguini and the salmon, they have some new favorites, like duck and waffles or the wild mushroom pot pie. I also love the atmosphere of the place ... we usually sit in the bar area since it is not as loud as the main restaurant, and we always receive great service."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great appetizers, great service. Thanks to Mike at the bar for taking such great care of us."}
{"text":"Tried the brunch today, and I wasn't impressed.  I have been here before, and like the place, but I've been to better brunches for half the price.  We came in about 12:30, and made our way to the buffet to find half of it empty, and the half that was there was old, cold, or both.  Crusty dry waffles with a side of empty fruit to (not) top it, old scrambled eggs, stale donuts, fruit that looked older than my niece, and cold pre-cut prime rib.  I have heard good things about this place and am hoping it was just a fluke, but I can only review what i experienced.  

On a positive note, the server was very nice, and treid her best to make the experience a good one.  I am not a complainer at restaurants, but had to mention that the food was empty, and she went right over to the kitchen, and told themthey need to get on it.  Unfortunatly, she was the only positve note to the meal, and that doesn't redeem anything when there were so many just plain mediocre foods on the buffet."}
{"text":"Have come here for their happy hour a few times and the food is excellent!   The Edamame Potstickers and their flatbreads are standouts.

The service has been great and the drink well prepared.   Good selection of beers on tap and a menu of specialty drinks.

Gets pretty crowded during the week.  The service has been top notch and I recommend happy hour here wholeheartedly!

Been back several times!"}
{"text":"Drinks were solid.  Trout was good but totally disappointing was the Angus burger ($16 w/fries) which was mediocre, forgettable and more bun than burger."}
{"text":"By far my favorite go to place when looking for something more upscale that will not require a second mortgage.  I have been about 4 times now and have never been disappointed.

This place has the exposed beams, open floor plan, huge fire place open on two sides.  The service is always flawless and extremely friendly.  The food is a good mix from meat to vegetarian.  They have fantastic apps, but be careful because they are a meal unto themselves.  They have a butternut squash and balsamic flat bread that is wicked good.  Burgers are some of the best.  They have a homemade bolognese that is out of this world as well.

Drinks and deserts are great value.  

So if you are looking for something a little more upscale to spend some good, un-rushed quality time with friends, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful. The servers were very nice and always asked when we needed something. I gave this a 5 star because everything was great even the building design. The food is a little higher in price but its one of those places where you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Went to Blue Canyon for happy hour, it was our first time visiting, and it definitely won't be our last! We sat in the bar area and we were greeted immediately by our server, and we quickly received our drinks as well! The cocktails are delicious and we ordered a Chorizo flatbread that was divine! ! They didn't skimp on the size either!! The atmosphere is rustic and high quality furniture."}
{"text":"Very busy on Friday nights. Staff overburdened and didn't look after our group of 11--with a reservation. 30 minutes just to get bread and water. 2 hours for the main course to be served. One person's dinner was stone cold.

The main dining area was loud. It was difficult to follow any type of conversation at the table.

However, the manager stepped up to the plate and admitted the lack of staff and took care of us."}
{"text":"I can't review the food as we only had drinks...Pete the bartender made one of the best marinis I've ever had.  He added a touch of Tabasco sauce that gave the drink a completely different dimension...exceptional drink."}
{"text":"Two of us, steak and short ribs, one drink which didn't fill the martini glass, $100.  Food fair, not great. Bad value, very ordinary experience for a hundred bucks"}
{"text":"It should be obvious, but after reading some of their reviews I see that other people haven't quite figured out that Twinsburg, OH, is not exactly the logical place to order lobster or fish. It takes about 10 seconds in this hunting-lodge style venue to see that they specialize in meat. They also fall victim to weird everything-but-the-kitchen-sink appetizers, too. The flatbreads would be so much better if they edited the ingredients to something simpler and focused on great flavors. 

All that aside, I do think they do a pretty decent job of providing meat-and-potatoes meals. I always get the short ribs and they're great. My husband always gets steak, and has always been very happy. 

In short, if you live in the area and want to have a nice meal without having to go too far, then it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Great food and overall feel of the place was great.  Was in town for work and loved all the great places to eat. This was the top on my list of places in the twinsburg area to eat.  Would love to come back if i ever get the chance."}
{"text":"Love love love it here!! Great food and atmosphere!! I always feel like I'm in a beautiful cabin in the woods!"}
{"text":"Even though the weather was terrible the night we had reservations for, in fact white out snow! We ventured about 30 miles to the restaurant. It was packed and we were seated immediately. Our waitress was cordial but somewhat hurried due to how many tables she had. The food was cooked to perfection and great portions. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was wonderful! Came in during Happy Hour, sat at the bar and ordered off of that menu. We had two flat breads and I wasn't impressed at all. The chicken pesto had entirely to much cheese, hardly any pesto sauce and even though there was a ton of chicken,  it had dried out when it went into the oven. I think with some tweeking this would be a good flat bread. To heavy handed with the cheese and maybe if you tossed the chicken in the pesto sauce too,  that would help!"}
{"text":"Took my husband to Blue Canyon for the Father's Day brunch.  They left no room for improvement.  It was outstanding in every single aspect.  What a great experience."}
{"text":"I was there a few years ago with my husband and we were both disappointed in the food.  The atmosphere is beautiful but I've had much better food in the Cleveland area, and even at DiAngelos (spelling) in Twinsburg.  I returned to the Canyon with my girlfriend a month ago, and was even more dissapointed in the food and embarrassed I told her this was a 4-star establishment."}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem. I dined there on April 14, and was pleasantly surprised. The wine and food are both great! I had the scallops, but tasted some of my boyfriends trout, delicious. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"POOR excuse for a restaurant ! Seriously the food is gross . Had the PORK belly tacos which was mushy . Pork belly should be crispy!!!  . Told the bar back young kid that the tacos were no good .... all he said was \"oh\" and had a stupid look on his face ! Place is very cold and totally outdated as well . If your a hillbilly you may enjoy this restaurant because the place has a large fake neon green lit up horse in the center of the bar which is goofy and you get the heehaw dismissive service like most hillbilly joints as you do at this one  too . ! Skip this dump and you will thank me later !!"}
{"text":"The menu was very intriguing but the portions were extremely small and it was very pricey.  The food was very good and I am usually willing to pay more for an upscale experience, however I think it was a bit out of line for the area and market based on the portions.  I would have loved to try more items, however for the price I will be going elsewhere.  There are other restaurants that compete with the quality of food and are more reasonable.  Maybe would go back for a very special occasion but won't make our list for frequent visits."}
{"text":"We had reservations one evening and were seated by the windows with a view.  (Although you could see the illuminated dumpsters at Cracker Barrel down below, the view was not that bad.)  The menu seemed a little limited but the food we ordered was fantastic.  Portion size seemed a little small for the price charged."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night with co-workers. The atmosphere and the view are wonderful on a summer evening. It has a luxury cabin feel. My NY strip was perfectly medium and seasoned well. I also sampled the Salmon, i'm not big on fish, which was great. The house cab is something everyone should try and I will definitely go here again if I venture out into Twinsburg again.. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went for the three course meal during restaurant week.  This place has such a cool cabin feel that I almost wanted it to be snowing outside to finish off the ambiance.  I had been to their awesome patio a few years ago but this was my first time dining inside.  The food was great. I got the bibb wedge salad, bacon crusted pork chop, and S'more.  I wish there wasn't as much down time between each course and their parking lot needs to be bigger.  All else was good."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed at the recent dinning experience. Poor service to say the least. Server wasn't paying attention switched entrees and messed up the orders big time. Very \" poorly prepared \"main courses . Looks like they dumped a lot of sugar syrup on the entrees . Nothing seemed right even after spending $150 . Would not recommend this place as the quality has gone down tremendously. 
Redemption: The wedge salad was ok
Thx

We all got together a fews year ago at Christmas, warm and inviting!"}
{"text":"I had my wedding rehearsal dinner at Blue Canyon last week. It was a big hit! It's a little out of the way, but totally worth it. The view was stunning from the back room. We felt like we were tucked away in our own private cabin in the woods! The service was great and the food was delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant especially if you have a large group!"}
{"text":"Come for Sunday brunch! Excellent options at a price of $28.95 - prime rib, oysters, mussels, pastries... So good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had reservations here for Valentines Day. We had been once previously to celebrate our engagement with family. This time around, we were excited to indulge a bit extra!

We started with drinks. I ordered a half bottle of Chardonnay, and the waitress said they were out of the half bottles of that choice but they did have full bottles if I was interested in that. I wasn't because my husband was drinking something else, but what I thought was interesting was that they had full bottles available and a recorking option. I would assume the half bottle got poured from a full bottle, which they had, so this was a bit baffling. I switched to a glass of a different Chardonnay and decided I'd order something else with dessert later on. 

We ordered a bowl of the bisque to share and it was very tasty. For entrees, I got the sirloin and my husband got the pretzel encrusted trout. My steak was good and cooked perfect medium. But my husband's fish was so. Good. He got the full size and it was two big pieces of trout. It was glazed in whole grain mustard and covered with capers. The mix of flavors was so delicious that I had more than a few bites of his along the way. 

For dessert, we split the chocolate bomb. I had an espresso martini and he had the spiked coffee, I forget what it was called. They were both quite strong, but tasty nonetheless. This is a great place to come for special occasions and even though the a very large restaurant, the seating is spacious and private while you dine."}
{"text":"I had the encrusted trout.  It was really good.  Nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great dinner. Wifey had the Trout. She loved it. I had the Lamb Shank. So tender, I didn't touch my knife the whole night except to butter some awesome yeast rolls. 

Service is top notch too.  We have been here a few times. Never a bad experience. Make reservations because the secret is out and everyone wants some."}
{"text":"Blue Canyon features fantastic food in a laid-back lodge-style atmosphere.  Although to me it seems like a steak and pork chop kind of place, and despite being nowhere near any kind of salt water, Blue Canyon serves up some great seafood dishes, as well as one or two freshwater offerings.  

The place features three or four separate areas: a bar with live music at times, a \"lodge\", a dining area, and a private room for parties.

A great deal is to try the tasting menus with wine pairings.   The term \"Diamond in the Rough\" was coined for Blue Canyon.

(The phone number is 330.486.BLUE, but Yelp would not allow me to put letters in there, and I am not sure I translated it correctly)"}
{"text":"Food is good but way too expensive for portion sizes. If you don't belive me, check out some of the pictures... The decor is different...yeah...very different...they really ran with the hunter...antlers on the wall theme which I don't really care for. Right now I'm too concerned with getting a \"bang for my buck\" hence the name...safe to say with unlimited dollars that I will not be back here."}
{"text":"foreword: i'm reviewing this place as a bar.

after a night of failure after failure, i went to the bar closest to my hotel room. i had three bacardi and cokes on my tab and the total came out to like 15.60. the bartender poured them strong and made sure i had a drink in fromt of me the whole time. i'm writing this drunk dramk as damn, cheers to you, pete. you make some good ass bacardi and chokes.

{"text":"Our family visited from out of town for the long weekend. We took them to dinner on Friday and were not disappointed. I had the trout, my husband had the Elk special, Sister and mom enjoyed the salmon and brother in law enjoyed the ravioli. The calamari and flat bread to start the meal were perfect. The service was well timed and we did not feel rushed."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best meal and worth the drive! My husband and I stopped in for a late night bite and were VERY pleased to know they offer smaller size entrees.  We each had the root beer glazed cedar salmon.  We were both COMPLETELY satisfied! So glad we we decided to make the drive. We sat at the bar to eat and were very pleased!  
Great experience! Great food! Great atmosphere!
Perfect for groups AND families AND ROMANTIC!  Blue Canyon has it all!!!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a group of work colleagues.

Ordered the house made chips with blue cheese and blue cheese cream and the semolina battered calamari as appetizers.

The chips were excellent. Very crispy and doused with blue cheese. The portion was so large that five of us could not finish.

The calamari was also very good with a smoky, spicy and smooth sauce on the side for dipping. The calamari were tender, lightly breaded and topped with a bit of seaweed salad.

As an entree I ordered the wild boar sauasge penne with spinach and a light parmesan sauce. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sausage was excellent with a wonderful porky flavor and a bit of spice.

The only detraction was the wine list was almost exclusively California-centric with a handful of Italian and French wines, none of them really caught my eye. 

The beer selection was better with some local brews and I opted for the Great Lakes Winter Ale which had a much flavor but was not at all heavy.

Service was attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Was beautiful restaurant! We were in a private room away from the other noise and customers which was accommodated wonderfully! We had about 13 people & had nice options starting with salad/bread then an entree (2 choices w/ our big group) & a dessert! The dessert was AMAZING! Big custard like chocolate ball that melted in your mouth & I had the steak which was mediocre. But overall experience was great! The waiter was a bit frazzled with a bigger group & was somewhat clumsy as if he was in training but we were patient! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great salad and scallops. Lot's of butter and salt on entree, so if you can't eat either, let waitress know!"}
{"text":"I've been to BC several times and enjoy the experience each time. This place is not cheap, but for the quality of food, reasonable. Servers are always friendly and efficient.

The Sunday brunch is really great."}
{"text":"I really wish that I could give this restaurant more than three stars, but an unfortunate run in with an army of fruit flies turned me off quite quickly. 

I was in town for work and some coworkers and I decided to stop in to the Blue Canyon for dinner on a Monday night. The exterior of the restaurant and its interior decor reminded me of a mountain lodge in Colorado. The place appeared clean and put together, which was surprising to me since it is located right off the interstate where you typically find run of the mill chain restaurants. 

Our waitress was extremely polite and helpful throughout the entire meal. She gave us recommendations on the local beers since we were not familiar with them and allowed us to try samples before making our selections. My coworkers went with the beer flight option and seemed to enjoy picking and choosing from the menu. 

The menu itself looked wonderful! There were a lot of choices and each one looked to have wonderful sides that came with it. The rolls they brought out early on in the meal were piping hot and fluffy - definitely better than your average bread basket. The blue cheese wedge salad was very flavorful and I appreciated the assortment of ingredients (blue cheese, lettuce, pecans, bacon, etc.). I went with the cast iron chicken for my entree and it did not disappoint! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and I could have easily split this with someone else or taken it home for leftovers. I did notice that the prices were on the expensive side taking into consideration the location (but then again I noticed this at all of the off-interstate restaurants in this Cleveland suburb so manbe things are just more expensive here).

The one disappointing factor of our trip to Blue Canyon was the swarm of fruit flies circling our drinks and food the entire evening. We had to cover up our drinks with napkins as they were longing for that alcohol and trying every which way to get into our cups. We mentioned this problem to the waitress and she admitted that they had been having issues with fruit flies and offered to replace any drinks that the flies got into. The manager also comped all of us a free dessert for the trouble, which they noted other tables had complained about as well. Hopefully they can get this problem under control because the food itself was actually quite tasty!"}
{"text":"ive saved all my yelp reviews for one day, and now im not wanting to write a long detailed review of a place that is well deserved of one with great detail.

everything i had was beyond bonkers-ly (made that word up since ive been using a lot of descriptive words today....) good. i tried several apps split between our table. sushi was most memorable. the complimentary bread they give you pre-meal is so gooooddd ... try not to fill up on it. 

i got a half portion of the pretzel crusted trout... now i dont even eat things call trout, or grouper, or catfish, but i had to try this. (i pretty much play it safe with salmon and tuna only). it was great. i would eat trout here again.

they also have a vegan option. im sure its almost nearly impossible to get something vegan in twinsburg.... so this is appreciated.

lastly, the decor and view are what seal the deal. walk around while your there. sit outside over looking the valley if you can. (i hope they just get rid of that abandon damons or whatever it is that is the only thing blocking the perfect view.)

Brandt is back at it again. And if you are in downtown cleveland.... check out his other spot- Pura Vida!"}
{"text":"Our first time at the Blue Canyon. We had a great time! Food and service were outstanding! completely enjoyed the entire experience!!  We highly recommend this restaurant as we will definitely be coming back. We are basic eaters who like our steaks and a good salad. I am very glad that we did not pay any attention to the negative reviews that some people have written. My thoughts are that you as a diner help create the experience for yourself. Many people are just miserable and you cannot do anything to please them. Overall this restaurant has  a great score and its well worth the drive wherever you live. WE love it!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here for three Genzyme dinner . They refuse to give you more then one piece of bread per person . Horrible at keeping v you drinks filled .i feel badly that Genzyme pays out a great price for a great venue yet customers are big giving a second piece  of bread !! Really . Customer service is not the best for the prices that are paid . When I ask management  t about the bread he said we could get more but out servers have refused to get them . Not a good place to hold a seminar !!"}
{"text":"We went there for brunch. It was probably at least 6 years since our last visit.
Nothing changed much.
Buffet was ok. Very good compared to other Cleveland's brunches. Typical choices plus you can order couple things from the menu which was part of the brunch."}
{"text":"While traveling on business, I decided to try this place since it was right next to my hotel.  I ordered the sea scallops and they were unbelievably salty, almost to the point it was inedible, and the green beans were very over cooked.  The only good thing about the meal was the mashed potatoes and the decent wine list.  Service was good and the log cabin decor is cute but I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Visited recently for drinks and dessert.

We love the dining room and bar's theme.  It's a great motif in a very well done room.  The bartender's service was great, the drinks had generous pours and the desserts were top notch.  We had both the Smores and the Ho-Ho's and enjoyed both.

For a trip just for drinks and dessert, it was on par, and we are fans."}
{"text":"This place has such a great architectural  atmosphere . Unfortunately, that's where it stops. Their menu is highly overpriced and the food is at the level of a Diner. I guarantee their chefs are warmed over short order cooks, with no executive chef in the kitchen.  The service is also a terrible, trying to up charge you with everything on the menu. I have been to Blue Canyon 10 times and it progressively is getting worse.  Do yourself a favor, and just order drinks and an appetizer."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable evening on the patio. We ordered a flatbread to start, then I had pulled pork tacos. It was a sparse dish, the pork, more pita style tortilla and a spicy cabbage. It was missing something. I drank a limoncello cocktail, good but too much carbonation."}
{"text":"I have been past this restaurant many times, stopped in for a beer after work but just today made the journey for dinner with some friends. 

I have to tell you this is clearly one of the best restaurants in this region for sure. 

The service was spot on, knowledgeable, honest and friendly. The food was perfect in every sense. This place is on the right balance between gourmet and easy to eat. Not too much yet enough to push your eating experience. 

I had the Chilean Sea Bass on the strong recommendation of our waitress. Getting me away from a strip steak for fish is no easy task and a risky one at best. I was blown away at this meal. It was fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation."}
{"text":"I have been there many times and service and food is typically outstanding. Our last visit was not even close. Our bill over $175 which again never minded before, but this time the waiter was completely unattentive and the food was over cooked. My husband couldn't eat his steak because it tasted charred (supposed to be medium) & my pork chops were burnt. We would have brought it to the waiters attention but by the time we got ones attention it was a kid who asked can I take your plates? At that point we said yes; paid and left VERY disappointed. Spending that kind of money you should not leave with regrets."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Blue Canyon. It is a very good menu, for rustic and satisfying dishes. I'd recommend this place more on a cold winter night than a summer evening, because the ambiance is like a great mountain lodge. This time, I had the braised short rib, which was a little disappointing because it was under-seasoned and there wasn't enough of the beef pan sauce to create the decadent richness that I hope for in a really good short rib. My first visit I had the BC Burger which was excellent and cooked to perfection, the fries were delicious too. 

Food aside Blue Canyon gets extraordinary marks for service. We were a party of 13 for a family member's birthday. Our server did not write anything down and yet every order was correct and arrived after only 45 minutes. All our drinks got refilled regularly. And she was incredibly patient while offering other easy food solutions to a couple of fussy children. Big, Big props to the Blue Canyon staff."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I had Easter brunch there today.  We have eaten dinner there on a few occasions and always enjoy the atmosphere, service and food.  It was the first time for the brunch.  It was rather pricey at 36.00.  The service was good as usual, however, the food was a bit disappointing.  They had set up carving stations with ham, turkey and prime rib. My husband and I both had some prime rib and ham.  The portions were so tiny, that they were gone in two small bites.  I feel at that price, that several ounces of meat would be in order, not a postage stamp size.  I asked for another piece of prime rib as I said it was mostly fat and the server said all the pieces were fatty and didn't give me another.  I heard other patrons complaining about the meat as well.  The rest of the food was adequate, but nothing to write home about.  Will probably return for dinner again, but not a holiday brunch at 36.00.  Oh well, it was better than having to cook I guess."}
{"text":"Okay. Food is good, but portions are small and very overpriced. Nice staff. Clean. Great atmosphere, but not worth the cost to play."}
{"text":"It had probably been close to 7 years since our last visit to Blue Canyon and I can honestly say, not much has changed. Same old ski lodge meets hunting cabin motif complete with painted wildlife murals and faux antler chandeliers. It's like if you had asked Ted Nugent to design your restaurant. Same old hyper attentive and slightly stuffy wait staff wearing the same old all-black uniforms. But what about the menu? Thanks to Yelpers of old, I can tell you that most of the main menu items are still there - pretzel crusted trout, lobster mac and cheese, scallops, braised beef short ribs, grilled salmon. It's a culinary time capsule. It's not totally wrong to stick with something if it works - I think everyone should offer a soft pretzel appetizer - I'm just saying that, as a restaurant, having a regular menu that adapts with the times and seasons is a good thing.

There's no denying that Blue Canyon's impressive. The place is massive, almost theme park like in its scale. Rough-hewn timber beams, giant outside patio, blue icicle lights adorning the eaves, weighty wooden front doors. There's even a huge fireplace that makes up the centerpiece of the dining room. It seems like a structure that would be more at home nestled on a resort somewhere rather than plopped down in suburban Twinsburg, Ohio between a Get Go gas station and a Hilton Garden Inn. And did I mention the wood? My god, the wood. Now I know what the Keebler elves must feel like. So whether you call it rustic, cowboy chic, classy trailer, it's definitely something. It's like Great Wolf Lodge without the waterslides.

The service during our meal was really good, I can't deny it. If anything, it just felt a bit forced and pretentious, especially for a place that seems to have such a laid back aesthetic. I'm not suggesting they have buckets of peanuts on every table that you shell onto the floor, but they could dial back the \"butler\" a little. Some of the highlights of our service included:

Constantly filled water glasses
Well-paced delivery
Attentive but not hovering server
Speedy removal of spent plates

The menu at Blue Canyon does not cater to the healthy eater. It's full of meat, cheese, potatoes and butter. There's even meat encrusted with other meat if you're so inclined. The bottom line - come to indulge or face some limited choices. I, unfortunately, chose the latter and paid the price.

Crunchy Ooki Sushi Roll - My wife ordered the half-size plate of this appetizer and at 4 large pieces, was glad she did. Imagine your typical sushi roll: sticky rice and nori wrapped around a center of crab, cream cheese, and pickled jalapeno tempura battered then fried. Served atop a drizzle of sweet soy glaze with sides of pickled ginger and wasabi paste. Not a bad dish although I found it to be very sweet with the sweet rice and sweet glaze on the plate. I also got very little crab meat and it tasted artificial.

Sophia Salad - Mixed greens tossed in apple cider vinaigrette and mixed with spiced pumpkin seeds, goat cheese and dried apple chips. This is a great fall salad. I really loved the combination of goat cheese and apple (they were stingy on the apple with only two small, paper-thin chips) and expected the pepitas to have more heat than they did but overall a solid offering.

Lil Greens Salad - Mixed greens, red onions, cucumbers and tomatoes with a maple balsamic vinaigrette. About as good as a salad comprised of these ingredients could be but a bit too much syrup for my taste.

Lobster Linguine - Your typical lobster linguine dish. Pasta, butter-poached lobster, lemongrass butter sauce and scallions. Again, not a bad dish just dated. It was my wife's selection so I can't fault the dish too much (not my thing) but I found the lobster to be tough and the sauce heavy. The half portion is more than enough for a single serving.

Skinny Grilled Chicken - I went the healthy route and I should have known what to expect. First, the breast, all 6 ounces of it, was cooked skin-on and bone in. I'm sure this was done to increase the moistness of the meat during cooking - it did not work. The meat was tough and dry and the potatoes, steamed red skins, were unevenly cooked. The asparagus was tasty and cooked fork tender but I could have done without the tomato olive tapenade. Healthy eating doesn't mean boring and lifeless. This dish was both.

I was pretty uninspired by this visit and doubt it will challenge us to return again. Blue Canyon reminds me of a place where you'd hold a corporate sales strategy meeting before heading to the golf course to discuss margins and market share. It's overpriced, the menu is dated and the most exciting thing about it was the giant horse statue rearing up over the bar. But don't count it out completely, your grandma would probably love it."}
{"text":"This is likely the best restaurant in all of Twinsburg. Try the pretzel crusted trout, the sauce on it was creamy, mustardy and wonderful. Everything else we have tried on the menu has been nothing but superb. If it's tough to park, there's valet, great for winters."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurants  my town picks to hosts one of their dinner and show nights and one we look forward to most. Since this part of a discount group package we only get the choice of Salmon or chicken both with amazing mashed potatoes and green beans. The baked bbq chicken is good but the salmon is A+. And did I mention the mashed potatoes?? YUMMMM! the portions are a good size, fairly big, definitely filling. I never leave there hungry. We also receive dessert which is usually this chocolate bomb thing. Its chocolate cake with mouse then covered in chocolate and drizzled with raspberry sauce. Not my favorite but is still pretty good. 
The service is very good considering we come in with 200 people or more. Everyone gets serviced quickly with no mistakes. And they have no problem making changes to the pre-planned menu for us if someone has a special dietary need. 
I think given the location, not too far out or crowded downtown, this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience with Blue Canyon. We had a lunch time wedding reception in the Lodge room and from the time we booked it all the way through the day of the event, the staff was accommodating and delightful. Mary Grace was super responsive. The ladies at the hostess stand, the servers during the lunch, the young gentleman outside and the bar tending staff... all of them gave top notch service. 
Now, the food. I received so many compliments on the food including multiple \"best pork chop I've ever had\" and \"best salmon I've ever had\"! 
We will definitely be back for our future anniversaries and events. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have dined here numerous times, most recently on New Year's Eve. The atmosphere is \"upscale western lodge\", kind of like dining in a Jackson Hole resort for millionaires. Despite the fact that the staff all wears jeans, most of the guests will be somewhat dressed up-- nicer pants, sports coats, etc. 
The food is really quite good. Our favorite items here include the Lobster & Bacon Mac & Cheese, Mushroom Bread Pudding, and the Flatiron Steak.  OMG, almost forgot the Lobster Nachos!   I've never eaten anything here that was not well-executed.  Generous portions.  Most appetizers sized for 3-4.
Solid wine list, good cocktails. Wait staff have always been friendly & knowledgeable. 
The downside?  Well, it's not a cheap night out.  You wouldn't expect it to be, would you?  Budget about $100 for dinner for 2, but it's money well spent."}
{"text":"It was a good time spent with family and fiends, but there were quite a few missteps.  Hostess were slow to acknowledge we were there, not overly busy when I arrived for my reservation. The table was set for seven, but I had affirmed eight just the day before.  Overly salty steaks and overly lemon in the scallops; just let the quality of the meat
Do it's job.  The steaks were over done.  I think it was a timing thing with the meal.  Now the short ribs, best meal at the table!  Perfect!!  I am not typically a critical reviewer, but if your dropping five bills on a meal, you expect it to be outstanding.  The waitress was super nice.  Friendly and welcoming.  I do not blame her for the food issues."}
{"text":"I booked Blue Canyon for Easter brunch for a party of 4.  The table was ready on time and the hostesses and server were friendly and attentive.  Once we got there we noticed the menu was not the same as what we had found on their website when I booked in March 29th and were told the changes were upgrades...which was debatable. My husband was disappointed with the changes and posted on their Facebook page, they responded that the menu was from 2012, but I have a screenshot dated March 29, 2017 from their website. The old menu has since been taken off the website, but rather than just apologize for the confusion they chose to say we found the old menu \"somewhere online.\" The carving station and the bussers were pretty bad. The carvers were inconsistent with serving sizes and didn't offer things like the au jus...and the bussers kept slamming the cutlery drawer next to the table, cleaned off tables in use while people were at the buffet and weren't thorough wiping down the tables. The food was decent but nothing special, especially for the price. The desserts weren't made in house but were premade cakes and donuts bought in from Peace, Love and Little donuts. The dining room was a cute lodge decor but freezing cold. I'd say for the price point you can't find a better meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best brunch and service EVER. Top notch establishment. Highly recommended. The dinners are wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Appetizers were good. The steaks were dry,  not much flavor, and over priced.   The waitress misled my girlfriend about ordering her steak.   She originally asked for a $26 steak,  but we ended up with a $51 steak on our bill.   The waitress took no responsibility for this mixup and was rude when I asked about it. 

I would NOT go again,  and I would not recommend getting any of the steaks.   If you do,  make sure you are 100% clear on which one you order,  some of them have similar names.  And they will undoubtedly charge you for the more expensive one."}
{"text":"22 members of our family needed a brunch spot that could accommodate people who ate seafood but not meat, people who ate meat but not pork, and people who were fussy about food.

Blue Canyon set a nice tone with its hunting lodge atmosphere.  Great service.  The brunch food was fine; some of it bland, some of it interesting (mac and cheese, red and yellow tomato salad).  What was out on the buffet tables was supplemented by made-to-order pancakes, omelets, and eggs benedict (the waitress takes your order and brings it back from the kitchen).

I really like the fact that my cranberry juice came in a wine glass.

BC was a good choice for our family event."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing staff...great evening out w family and friends.What a gem ! A little pricey for our budget but not unreasonable we will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night and everything was excellent. Ordered a Moscow Mule to start. Very flavorful and strong which is always nice for a $10 drink. Ordered the double bone porkchop and my date ordered the steak with mashed potatoes. Food was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Will definitely be returning soon. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing scallops. I actually ask to replace the lobster meat with scallops in their lobster pasta which has THE best lemongrass butter sauce and fresh pasta. FANTASTIC! Highly recommended for a special evening out."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great atmosphere is great if u never tried this place try it had the shrimp flat bread it had bacon on it bacon was sooooooo under cook this was bad experience here for this meal first time maybe a new cook service was very good  bartender  was very attentive"}
{"text":"very good. pricey, but they do have quite a few lunch specials which make it good for groups, at least during the week. impressive rustic stone walls and lodge atmosphere, with a better view than you'd expect as they are right off of the highway.

awesome pasta. lobster nachos were excellent. burgers come with a choice of fries, and in a huge and lovely wax paper cone, unique and delicious."}
{"text":"All I can say is DA BOMB!!! Visited here while in Ohio for work and I'm pissed they don't have one of these spots in Michigan. The Yukon Gold Chip w blue cheese was by far one of the best appetizers I've ever had (so much so I ordered a second one and this this is HUGE enough for 6-8 people to share. For an entree the waitress recommended I try the lobster linguine (with spinach added) and it did not disappoint me. I'm not sure how I was able to eat two appetizers and my entire entree but I did and I'm happy I did. 

I read a few reviews about this place and I'm not sure what a lot of the rhetoric is about saying this place is too expensive/overpriced and or the food was not good. But looking at the overall demographics of the negative posters profile PLEASE disregard those post those people must me Sunday diners only. I've spent more on a hamburger than some of the entrees they offer. They even offer small plate portions for only $15. Entrees range about $20-$35 not bad and all look and taste GOOD. 

I plan on making the 3 hour drive just to take my wife here for a nice romantic surprise dinner."}
{"text":"Very weird service tonight. Ordered half order of trout and full arrived. They took it back and brought less than a third of it. Under the fish were about 4 small potato wedges. I ordered the beet salad and wanted to take it home and the server tried to whisk it away! He said he'd box it up but he never brought it back! For some reason, they sent us a side of potatoes which we thought we'd take home- completely untouched. When we said we were going to take them home, he already had dirty plates on top of them! That box will stay on the table! Bad drink service and we only had water! 

We also had the worst seats in the house! 

Boyfriend  talked to manager, which wasn't helpful. He offered us 25% off our next visit? Why future visit? Why not now? Will not return."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey, but the atmosphere is phenomenal... We've been here a half dozen times over the past two years and we've never been disappointed of anything we ordered... The most difficulty we have is deciding what to order because it all looks great. I highly recommend reservations on the holidays and weekends. The Hilton Garden in is next door and a great place to stay after a great meal here."}
{"text":"I have never had a more disappointing meal than the one I had at Blue Canyon. Our appetizers tasted reheated and my short ribs were extremely dry and flavorless. 
Our guests wanted to try the bread pudding so we ordered two servings for the table.  After one bite we asked for our check and left.   We will never return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a group! Friendly service. Overall food was good but VERY SALTY!  They really need to watch how much salt they put on food.

My husband, dad, and I enjoyed the wild boar. My in laws felt the potatoes had too much seasoning.

We will go there again and recommend to friends but over salting needs to be addressed with management and the kitchen.

Recommendations: calamari, maple bacon flatbread, wild boar!"}
{"text":"Came for Easter brunch. Had a party of 13, was never told ahead of time we wouldn't be sitting together, so when we arrived and found our table split up we were very disappointed. If we were told ahead of time we wouldn't have made the reservation and made other plans.  When we asked if there was another arrangement we could make, we were just told NO, repeatedly, shown other parties that were also separated, and we were told they have over 200 reservations today. This is terrible customer service and we will not return...If I was a manager I would have comped some drinks or gave a discount on the total as a good will gesture, but that was not offered. We were looking forward to seeing everyone and share the holiday, which we couldn't unless we awkwardly switched tables and tried to mingle. Moving on,  the prime rib was extremely tough, flavorless and dry as well as the ham, and for 40 bucks each, I expected a properly prepared meal. The mimosa was one of the smallest I've ever seen. While the atmosphere is nice, the service and food were not worth. Customer service makes or breaks a business and it broke this one for me."}
{"text":"Not being from here and the restaurant being right next to Hilton Garden Inn, thought I would give it a try. Great surprise and meal experience. Lodge like environment, great beer and wine selection, and one of the best salads I have ever had ( you have to like Kale and Beets). Enjoyed it and the atmosphere, especially while traveling. I will be back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"It's great that Twinsburg has a restaurant like this, but it's too bad the food isn't better. It's definitely the kind of place people from miles around will take out-of-town guests to, but don't expect to get much for your money.

We ambience is great, the place is hopping, and the menu sounds inspired, but the food is just plain bland. Every one of our entrées, fish, steak, and pasta, was so flavorless we had to cover it with salt and cheese. How do you make flavorless grouper? How do you take the flavor out of steak? Even flatbread pizza was limp and flavorless.

The only thing with real flavor was the s'mores dessert, and that was actually a bit of a problem. They added peanuts to the chocolate and the \"graham cracker\" and it overpowered the rest of the flavor. Other desserts (crème brûlée, ice cream) were obviously fresh out of the freezer and nothing special.

I really wanted to like Blue Canyon but I'm afraid it wasn't to be. We may come back if we find that our guests really love exotic game, but we won't be back for our own meals. The chef should try some of the food, especially at this price!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with both the service and the quality of the meal. Our waitress was scattered as she left a drink order out, abruptly left us after drinks were ordered. We wanted to order a few appetizers and eventually did. 
The calamari was good especially the Asian type dipping sauce that came with it. I ordered the veal schnitzel and so did another person in our party(6). As I began to sample a piece I found that the schnitzel was undercooked and gummy.-both orders were sent back and in less then 5 minutes we were given new orders that must have been thrown into the fryer. How else could they have come back so fast, so dry and so over cooked. Yuk. The place was dead except for another table of 8-10 people. We would have ordered another drink and definitely could have used water refills. We didn't stick around for much longer as the other table of drunks started singing.
The manager did offer anything on the menu and free dessert. But how many chances do they get to make it right? Two should have been enough-it certainly wasn't a complicated dish and attendance was low. The Brussel sprouts were heavenly seasoned with garlic and oil."}
{"text":"Got the vegan ravioli.  I am a vegan, and it was tasty.  However, it could have used a little \"oomph.\"  A splash of toasted spicy pecans, a dash of a good olive oil, and a little more of the balsamic reduction.  It was slightly boring, although very flavorful with all the herbs.  It just needed a little \"wow.\"  Also, I requested olive oil dipping for the bread; I was brought the vinegar and oil which was highly disappointing.  The olive oil was smelly and rancid.  It would be great to have a good olive oil and herb for dipping.  The cream cheese/white bean spread for the bread was very good according to my date, but not appropriate for the vegan.  My date, who is a kitchen manager/chef had the pecan crusted trout and said it was great. 
Dessert: BY FAR the BEST creme brulee I have had in ages!!  I used to be a pastry chef, and hence I am very particular about dessert quality.  This dessert was fantastic.  I bent my vegan rules and tried it, and was highly impressed.  It was better than fine restaurants in San Francisco and LA.  
Food:  Overall the menu offers many interesting, creative, and seasonal dishes, mostly for meat-inspired dishes.  I was impressed with the menu and wine list.  The patio was closed for the season, but was very appealing.  
Service:  On the spot!  Very impressed, as sometimes I feel like a restaurant critic in the way I expect superb service and food, but he was excellent.  
Ambiance:  Most people were dressed in a nice casual way-no T-shirts, tennis shoes, etc.  Children were present, but mannerly.  I appreciate that it is a little upscale (It basically has to be because the prices are higher, affording dining to only those who can afford it) It is nice to have a nicer choice for dining in northern Ohio, where there are few good options for such.  
Overall:  great choice for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"Not good. It's like some new culinary school grad planned the menu. Just a mishmash of good ingredients ruined by poor creativty. I mean, they screwed up the bread and butter! Why not just give out some fresh simple rolls and fresh butter instead of the tough (not crusty)  sun dried tomato and herb roll with garlic and pine nut butter. Poor texture on top of too many flavors that didn't really match up well. Yuck!  And that was just the bread.
       I had the lobster linguini. Here's a thought: Why not let the lobster be the star? Why feel like you have to botch it up with a ridiculous grainy and viscous  lemongrass sauce?  It was poor. 
        While not \"terrible\" the fact that they charge so much for this nonsense gets them one star. You deserve better Ohio. This is mediocre fare trying to pass itself of as fine dining by using a very pretty setting and long descriptions with a lot of fancy sounding ingredients and then charging a lot for it.

Oh, and on a side note, if Im paying 30 bucks for a plate of food, maybe the waitress shouldn't be calling me \"honey\" everytime we interact. They do that at diners."}
{"text":"Wonderful food at reasonable prices.  My ravioli special was as good as any pasta I have ever had.  Our favorite waitress, Mary, makes every meal special.  She is a real delight.  One bad aspect of the meal was when our server's helper handed me my meal, instead of placing it in front of me.  It shows a lack of training.  Mary promised to bring this up at the next staff meeting."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise - beautiful and spacious dining rooms, friendly and competent wait-staff and excellent food. Had the salmon served over mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked green beans. An amazing chocolate dessert topped the meal. We shall return!"}
{"text":"Food was not even hot. Horrible service! Was with a party of 14. Took us 4 hours and 20 minutes to eat and cash out. Will not be back"}
{"text":"As the reviews indicate, a diner does not know what to expect.  This place is like a good-looking person with a snarky disposition.  I think that the comments that the food is over-priced are in keeping with the average or below quality that my friends and I have experienced.  Pretty much any price for food that simply does not live up to the hype is way too much.  I live in Twinsburg, and went here on the recommendation of neighbors.  The first meal was so-so.  I gave it a couple more chances--over the strenuous objections of my thrifty husband--and I was never impressed.  Because of the location and lack of other \"fancy\" restaurants nearby, though, I took a group of friends for a celebration.  Of course, I made a reservation well in advance and knew I'd be paying a hefty \"service charge\" imposed by management.  (Just pay the darn servers, management! The tipping system sucks--when it becomes a tax, it is not a \"gratuity\"!)  

The food was nothing, nothing, nothing special--the twelve of us agreed, and we all ordered different expensive things and tasted the orders of others at the table.  What really rankled was the terrible service.  Had I been able to determine the \"gratuity\", I would have demanded that the \"servers\" fork over money to us, as an apology for bad attitude.

When we arrived just before 8:30, there were TWO other parties there on a Saturday night when no major sports events were taking place.  That struck us as odd.  What got us all more burned than the wild boar tenderloin (ordered medium rare) was that the waiters treated us as if we were intruding on their leisure.  The tenderloin was complained about, and the waiter glanced at the plate and said that it looked fine to him--end of conversation.  Wine flowed freely (well--expensively, but in quantity), but the teetotaler among us had to ask for more water every time her glass was empty, and had to wait to ask until a waiter could be located--in a nearly empty restaurant.  

About 9:30, despite the problems, our party was going strong just because we were together.  THEN the waiter appeared--and started removing plates without asking.  \"Uh, I'm not done with that,\" said one diner, determined to get whatever value he could from his blah meal.  The waiter heaved a huge sigh.  He reappeared two minutes later and said, snippily, \"Looks like you are done now!\" and took the plate.  We ordered desserts--passable flan, no other standouts--and they were brought to us around 9:45.  We were also served the comment: \"You are aware that we close at 10, aren't you?\"  We reassured him that we were indeed aware. He returned a few minutes later to survey our eating progress--saying nothing, but sighing mightily.  One of us remarked that he felt as if he were eating at Grandma's house and that Grandma ignored complaints and5 punished dawdling.

Sure enough, at 9:59 sharp--I checked my watch--the waiter announced, \"We're closed now.  You have to leave.\"  Of course he sighed again--and glared--when we asked if we could at least take our desserts with us (Chocolate Bomb, S'mores, and something else I can't recall.) Getting to eat the food we were paying for was apparently too much to ask.

The experience was memorable, that's for sure.  We often joke about it now, but we felt anything but humorous at the time.

OF COURSE THIS CANNOT BE TYPICAL.  Even my previous experiences had not been like this.  You may love the food and have the best service ever.  But this is Yelp, where we are supposed to share our own experiences and judgments.  What I can say is that not one of the twelve of us there that night has been back to the Blue Canyon--and not one of us has any intention to return."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a wonderful deal.  Lots of great food choices and excellent drink selection.  The Tavern is warm and inviting.  The children's menu is diverse but buttered noodles was a small portion. Flatbreads and burgers are the best options.  Their chips are covered in delicious blue cheese and so good."}
{"text":"Mixed review.  We had the rehearsal dinner for my son's wedding there and it was excellent.  Very good customer service and the food was wonderful.  Two days later we went there for the Sunday brunch.  What a huge disappointment for $40 a person.  Buffet food was not hot.  A waste of money."}
{"text":"It had probably been about five years since I had been to Blue Canyon. Thought I would give it a try again. Unfortunately it was average at best. I thought the drink I had was very low-quality. I had ordered the peach sangria. It said there were supposed to be peaches in it, and there were none. Honestly I would say it only had a splash of alcohol. Very disappointing. There's another restaurant that I will leave unnamed that has an awesome happy hour seven days a week that makes the most awesome peach sangria. We had a strange waiter also. He was so overly friendly that it was actually obnoxious and fake feeling. He actually made the drinks which I don't think he knew what he was doing. I don't understand why they don't have a bartender when this is supposed to be a more upscale restaurant. The food was not terrible though. Very small portions for the price I paid. We sat in a booth because I thought it would be more comfortable, but it's one of those horseshoe shaped kinds which for a couple is not very good. Unfortunately I could not recommend this place. I believe there are much better choices. It's a shame because it's in the city I live and would like to support local. Oh well!"}
{"text":"If there was a way to give 0 stars and still write a review, I would have.  This is probably the worst dining experience I have had in years - not the service and the food.  We sat on the patio and when we sat down there were probably 10-12 other tables out there.  I am not sure how many servers there were, but there were a lot of people in orange shirts running around.  The speed of service was super slow and very inattentive for the ratio of employee to tables.  We ordered our drinks and they came about 8-10 minutes later, which for an iced tea, Pepsi and Sangria seems a tad extreme.  We then ordered our appetizers, which came quickly but were not hot, they were room temperature at best.  Also, no appetizer/sharing plates were brought to the table and we had two appetizers and three of us- that makes sharing a challenge.  We also watched the food runner try to take our appetizers to three other tables; we had to claim them.  While we were waiting for our appetizers to come we asked our waitress if we could order dinner, and she then disappeared for a while.  We were seated for 25 minutes before she took our dinner order and we asked multiple times (and multiple people.)  In this time, someone else dropped off two waters at our table (there were three of us.)  We had to ask what the specials were.  I ordered my Elk medium-rare and it came out medium well.  My son ordered his steak medium rare and it came out medium.  My mashed potatoes were clearly old.  My son's green beans came with fried onions that were super soggy and tasted like they were fried in old oil.  No steak knives were provided which made cutting my super over cooked Elk and my son's steak hard to cut.  All three of our dinners came out lukewarm.  I ordered a cup of soup that never came and our server was so absent from our table that I could not ask about it.  I saw other tables get bread, we didn't get any - not sure if bread is brought upon request or not, but again, our server wasn't around to even ask.  No manager came to our table so we could even express our extreme dissatisfaction.  My son's dinner was supposed to come with ice cream.  We had to ask for it - and it also took forever.  It shouldn't haven't taken us almost 2 hours to have dinner.  

The bar drinks were good and well balanced.  This was the only good thing. 


HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE- I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best tasting meals I've ever had in my life!

While on business in January, I was taken to the Blue Canyon.  From the outside, I was impressed.  This monsterous log cabin \"spoke to me\" of warmth, comfort and a good meal...

The interior was very warm and charming as well.  

I ordered the Pretzel Crusted Trout.  First of all, I'm not a fish person, per se, but it was recommended and it did NOT disapoint.  The portions were pretty large yet, not overly imtimidating.

Although my associate ordered Lobster Mac and Cheese and it was MASSIVE!  She didn't even get through half of it before she was full.  :)

We had dessert too, I can't remember the names, but something apple and a chocolate torte.  HEAVEN!  

It was pretty loud in there, so conversation was a little difficult, but the food more than made up for that!  Definately will be heading back there on my return to OH.

Make sure you make reservations, as this place was pretty packed even on a Tuesday night.

A memorable evening with fantastic food!

Service was also very warm and friedly.

Overall, one of the most memorable restaurants I've ever been too (and I've been to many many many!)"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've ever had! The building is beautiful and quite cozy. Perfect date night. Our waiter was extremely prompt and very friendly. He was also really helpful with recommendations on food. Our wait was very short and our food came out really fast. 

We started out with the Margherita flatbread and it was delicious. Perfectly crisp crust and just the right amount of cheese and tomatoes. My husband ordered the wild boar and it was cooked to perfection. Had a great taste and the sides were just as wonderful! I had the lobster linguine and was simply amazed at the amount of lobster in it! The lobster was cooked just right and had wonderful flavor. The entire dish was one I would happily order again. The portion was fairly large for me so I will definitely be able to have another meal out of it. 


If you haven't been to Blue Canyon yet, I don't know what you're waiting for! Get in your car and GO. I promise you, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I go here often and they get it right 8 out of 10. Service is always good, but food comes up short every now and then. The most important thing is they take care of mistakes when I am dining in, but it's not ok when I get carry out and I get home and can't enjoy my food."}
{"text":"Been there twice now. Food is good but the service is not so great. Both days I went there I sat at the bar. While the servers and bartenders were very polite to me I witnessed the manager yelling at employees at the bar. The first day I thought it was just she was having a bad day but then I went back the second day and she was at it again. Made me feel very uncomfortable. It shouldn't be happening out in front of customers like that. The food however was good. I got the salmon the first night. It was a little rarer than I expected but it tastes good. I got sirloin the second night and that was very good. The blue canyon Cabernet is also very good as well as the CMS blend."}
{"text":"So disappointed in their $27 brunch.  We thought it would be a nice family outing, but was an expensive mistake.  Shrimp cocktail was warm, potatoes practically raw, most food was cold.  There aren't many choice, so many family members struggled.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. My husband and I love this place. The calamari, 4 cheese dip, and lobster bisque are some of our absolute favorite items on the menu. The service is always wonderful. This is usually our go to for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"I've been to the Blue Canyon a countless number of times. (I have family from Twinsburg). Birthday's, anniversary's, company X-Mas parties and other occasions have been celebrated here. 

The first thing you'll notice when approaching the Canyon is it's trademark blue LED lights illuminating the outside perimeter, the wooden log type construction and lodge type appearance. Inside, it's more of the same. A lot of wood, rustic decor, chandeliers made of antlers, framed pictures of cowboys and wild game on the walls, fire places blazing and big picturesque windows. It's a truly remarkable looking establishment. 

Each time we've been there, we've been treated exceptional. The service is always knowledgeable and accommodating. The menu is what I would describe as \"Rustic Americana\". Most of the offerings are familiar dishes, mixed in with some interesting wild game variety's. 

The wine list seems adequate.They also offer various cheese trays to accompany a pairing. The beer list is a tad scarce. If you want a draft, there are 3 options: Great Lakes Dortmunder, Labatt or Blue Moon. Everyone who's ordered from the cocktail menu in our group has seemed to like them, especially the Key Lime Gimlet's. Personally, I didn't find anything appealing on the cocktail list as they all seemed too sweet to me, ie: a lot of fruity martini's. 

On our latest visit, we started with the Crispy Duck Wings in jerk seasoning & the Lobster Hush Puppies with a chipotle maple butter. Both were decently presented and tasted just fine, but neither wowed me. 

For an entree, I chose the Beef Short Ribs braised in BBQ and onions with a side of spoon bread and green beans. The Short Ribs were falling off the bone, tender and delicious. If I were to pick out a flaw though, I'd say the Short Ribs seemed to be a bit oversalted. The spoon bread, served in a mini cast iron cauldron was excellent. Just the right consistency with butter and corn flavoring. Overall, this meal was very satisfying. It was most certainly appropriate for a brisk fall night as it was very comforting. 

The dessert menu consists of a variety of coffees, after dinner martini's, malted scotch, ports and of course desserts. In the past, I opted for the Canyon's take on a Ho Ho or the Smores. This time, I went for the Root Beer Float. The float consisted of brownie ice cream, IBC Root Beer, Dolce de Leche caramel, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, all topped off with a chunk of peanut brittle. The dessert was heavenly and served as a nice night cap to a well had evening by all. 

Chef Brandt Evans certainly has an impressive dining destination. I'm sure we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Here for an 8:00am - 3:00pm business seminar.   

Upon arrival the parking lot and entrance are beautiful and inviting.   The landscape and building are absolutely stunning as is the view of the valley. Front door opens to a welcoming foyer and host stand!  Walking thru the facility to our private room,  the decor is rustic and very high end.  Open view kitchen brags the high end furnishings and equipment.   Staff is dressed professionally in uniform and all are polite and friendly!   

Our room is exceptionally appointed and perfect environment.   We are served a great breakfast buffet with all the fixings and a wonderful lunch with great dessert. 

I cannot wait to return for a dining experience that is independent of work!  His place is on our list of go to locations for next month!"}
{"text":"My experiences here have been great. The place is gorgeous and pricey so it's a special occasion place for me. I love the scallops, squash ravioli was good, and the s'mores dessert makes me purr. Service has always been very nice with no problems.
It's in Twinsburg next to a freakin' major highway but it feels like you're in a fabulous lodge in Colorado. I've never been to Colorado but it's how I would imagine it would be. I don't know, maybe there's a place in Colorado that feels like Twinsburg."}
{"text":"Had wild boar here for one of their specials. AMAZING!  Tasted like really good ribs but leaner.  Others had iron chicken, lobester pasta, and filet mignon.  Everything was great.  Should have a better beer list to go with the look. Only knock I can think of.... Good not great service as well. Didn't see our server as much as I would have liked. But attentive when she was there. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"What a rip off. Ridiculous beer prices during happy hour. $7 a pint, regular price is $8. No need for that price. Will not go back again!!"}
{"text":"We've gone here many, many times. I do love the food and the service with Jen was excellent. My problem each and every time we've ever been here is with the hostesses. They are always extremely rude. This last time they actually told us how long we could have our table for when we were seated. Ironically, we couldn't have been out as quickly as they wanted us to even if we tried because the kitchen didn't get our food to us fast enough. Don't get me wrong, the kitchen got our meals to us perfectly and since we had appetizers, soups, salads and entrees it took a while and was perfectly timed. That being said, the time allotted by the hostess was only possible if we'd have gone straight to the entrees. To make it worse we saw the hostess talking about us speaking to the manager about her to a co-worker as we left. Honestly, they simply need older hostesses that act more professionally. The hostesses are always much younger than their more proficient wait staff (and surely make less.) Blue Canyon would get 5 stars if not for their hostesses."}
{"text":"They could use a new cleaning service... Looks old and not very clean.  The plates on the table were dirty.  Server was clearly bothered when we chose not to booze and from that point on she was a bit standoffish.  The cheese bake ap was disgusting but she kindly removed it from the bill which was nice and not expected.  Salads were good but not once I noticed the hair in mine.  If you're a big eater and decide to go w the large portion, be prepared to be disappointed.  The plates are huge though.  Definitely not worth the money to eat mediocre food and look out the window at an empty Damon's."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat for that special occasion.  We love the decor, the wait staff is excellent, and the food is always great.  I have had fish, chicken, and beef dishes over our multiple dishes and they were always prepared perfectly and served in style.  The price is a bit higher than my regular place to eat kinds of places but for special occasions, it is a great place for my family."}
{"text":"This is our fourth time here for various dinners and parties. The food is above average and quit interesting. I am a little surprised you don't get a dinner salad with a $30 entree but times are tough. The potato chips on the appraiser menu were really tasty. The short ribs were also very good if your looking for low carb. The service was not what you hope for when your spending $100 pp. I think our server had a large party in Hudson so we didn't see her too often ;-) She was very pleasant when she was around however. My main complaint is the automatic 20% service fee. We did not know this was the policy (I did not make the reservation, so in fairness they could have informed my assistant) BTW we had a party of 6. We had a wine and bar bill of $400+ and I didn't feel too good about giving her a $80 + tip on that part of the bill. She also had the nerve to circle the word \"extra\" on the credit card bill in case I was feeling generous. The view didn't include the Manhattan skyline."}
{"text":"Just a word of advice - do not go there for Mother's Day Brunch!  My family was excited to go to Blue Canyon and try their Mother's Day Brunch.  I have been there for dinner on a couple of occasions and really enjoyed the atmosphere, food, etc.  Also attended their regular Sunday brunch a year or so ago - for $20 something.  Mother's Day Brunch price $41.95!  Therefore, I was expecting excellence - NOT!  Food was cold to luke warm!  Lettuce bed that shrimp and other items were on - wilted!  Their beef tenderloin was luke warm and so tough -
a person cut not cut it - with the butter knife that was supplied as a place setting.  You think they could at least provide a steak knife?  I finally gave up!  For anything hot - omelet, pancakes, french toast, and eggs benedict you had to place the order with your waitress - then after waiting some time you received what you ordered which was o.k.  So final thoughts - no longer will attempt to go to Blue Canyon on Mother's Day - not worth it!  And service was sub-par.  Year before my family attended a Mother's Day Brunch at Burntwood Tavern in Cuyahoga Falls - it was $26 and food was nice and hot and a lot of variety - including a person on line who made your omelet to order!"}
{"text":"My first meal at Blue Canyon was October 2015.  Excellent service, great atmosphere and the food was fantastic.  Couldn't wait to return!  This week (February 2016) I had dinner at Blue Canyon twice.  Monday evening - very attentive service, ordered the double bone pork chop...  what a disappointment!  Over cooked and dry - couldn't finish half the meal.  Okay - maybe a mistake, so I can back on Wednesday evening and ordered the special Bison slow-cooked ribs.  This was the most disgusting meal I've ever been served in an upscale restaurant.  Covered in greasy fat, I couldn't eat this meal after two bites.  I asked the server if they had changed their chef recently...  They changed chefs in November 2015...  

This is only rated two stars for atmosphere - great place to get a drink - maybe an appetizer.  Do not waste an evening on a meal, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Always a great food choice and different menu items. Nice bar!"}
{"text":"A TOTAL class act!  This has always been a unique experience each and every time we dine at the Blue Canyon. The food is fabulous and their Sunday Brunch is outstanding!! We love Scott...always spot on service!!"}
{"text":"My friend and i went here to grab drinks at the bar. The restaurant is beautiful and very rustic. We both ordered beers and split the baked cheese appetizer. It was huge and delicious. I ordered burger too but the appetizer was so big that I ended up taking most of my burger home. The best part was the bread they serve with a pistachio butter. Everything was delicious and the atomosphere was beautiful!!! I will be back on my next visit."}
{"text":"We met friends for a party of six 2 days before Christmas.  It was nicely crowded we had a reservation. Ww had a drink in the bar waiting for the rest of our party. Great service nicely done cocktails. We were seated, had a wonderful waiter who could not be more accommodating while not hovering. Food magnificent, great tastes and textures all perfectly cooked and seasoned. Coming from San Francisco we are restaurant and food selective. We will recommend our friends will recommend and we will most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Just an awful experience tonight, all around. From the start of our evening with a rude, overwhelmed hostess, to a scattered server, to downright uninterested valets, this place - which was previously one of our favorites - gets a huge thumbs down. 

We go out to dinner every Saturday night to nice restaurants. We are very accustomed to paying fair prices for well executed food. $150 was way too much to pay for my husband's fish-stick-sized halibut, awful salads, my short ribs with wilted, overlooked green beans and a bottle of wine. 

I'm so disappointed. Blue Canyon has always had a soft spot in my heart, as my husband and I have had many great meals here...and even ate here the night we were engaged. It has changed in quality so greatly. 

To top it all off, the service was horrid. Not well paced. And they routinely brought us other people's food. 

Just a horrid, horrid night...especially the hostess who refused to look at anyone and barked when anyone spoke to her."}
{"text":"We hosted an adult birthday party for 35 people on the Terrace.  The entire event from start to finish was 100% perfect.  The appetizers were beautifully arranged on platters and were delicious.  We had egg rolls, mini beef wellingtons, chicken and shrimp quesidillas, pita with artichoke dip, antipasto skewers and baked brie encroute.  We had an assortment of desserts.  The service to our room was great.  My niece who made the arrangements said that the staff was wonderful to work with in planning the event."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it's okay. For the price okay simply isn't enough. My most recent trip was probably a mistake because we went on NYE. I understand that NYE is a very busy night, but waiting 15 mins for someone to take our drink order is unacceptable. I had the pretzel trout. It was basically a piece of fish over some spinach and 4 or 5 pieces of potato chunks. Not very good and would recommend skipping it. She had the salmon which was tasty. The saving grace was the wedge salad and the bourbon cider. Overall I've  probably made my last stop at Blue Canyon. For the prices they charge I can get better food in Hudson, Solon, or Chagrin."}
{"text":"The service is very slow and the staff was not attentive. After we were served drinks no one followed up. After waiting over 45 minutes we were able to get the attention of a waiter and asked for our check which then took another 30 minutes. Beautiful place, yummy food but poor service."}
{"text":"A friend was coming to town and I was under pressure. \"Find us a lovely, comfortable dining spot near Twinsburg!\" were my marching orders. 

Enter Blue Canyon Kitchen & Tavern! 

Atmosphere: Scrubbed up casual; no t-shirts or flip flops. While there's certainly no need to don your tuxedo, this place is a smidgen upscale and asks you to make an effort . 

Food: Menu was creative, seasonal and diverse with the dinner specials being even more so. \"Braised Elk, anyone?\" 

Service: Fantastic!!! Friendly, attentive (although sensitive about barging into ones dinner conversation), knowledgeable about wine selection and food prep. Very impressed. 

Overall there's something for everyone here; fish people, steak people, veggie people...and...well...elk people alike. They also offer half portions of some of their more popular dishes (a feature that I absolutely ADORE). No need to stuff yourself with 3 days worth of calories; order the half portion of the tilapia or cedar plank salmon! You'll thank me later. =)"}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and always enjoy the food.  My favorite is the salmon with the root beer glaze.  Always delicious.  We always leave this place very full.  Great dining option in Twinsburg."}
{"text":"A wonderful Sunday brunch- perhaps the best I have ever had anywhere.  The nicest part is the eggs, omelets, pancakes, and the eggs Benedict of the day are ordered to table.  The latter, which I had on one occasion, was delightful.   Toasted muffin, grilled beef tenderloin, perfectly poached egg, crab meat and wonderful sauce.  Vast amount of brunch items including a seafood table (oysters, shrimp, et al).....just perfect.  Lunch and dinner can be hit and miss- which is why I did not give this restaurant a five.  This might be due to the fact that the chef has out of state restaurants to which he must also travel.  I've probably had 5 good lunches, 5 fair lunches, and two inedible.  One of the last times I was there we sent the food back because it had an off odor (gyros).  Chef Evans was there and did not even approach our table to inquire about the problem.  Another time the hamburger that I ordered had gristle and bone chips in it.  After two bites I couldn't eat any more- and when the server removed my plate she didn't seem too concerned that I hadn't touched my meal.  It took me two years to go back after that.  My suggestion- stick to brunch,  but if you go for lunch they make a good pot roast- but don't expect it to be served on homemade pierogies as the menu states- mine came on Mrs. T's!  Any questions about Hudson-Twinsburg restaurants or eateries on Cape Cod, feel free to email me at maudetyler@aol.com"}
{"text":"Beautiful place with excellent food! Make reservations and ask for a window seat. Blue cheese potato chips are the best!!!! Lister bisque is highly recommended also any steak or fish is always fresh! Cozy place with excellent food! If your in the area this is a must!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area. Great atmosphere, excellent food, and top notch service."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with Blue Canyon. Instead of looking rustic and vintage I thought the decor looked dirty and old. Short ribs were great. I was anxiously awaiting my seafood mac'n'cheese and was very disappointed. It tasted nothing like mac'n'cheese - it was like a fish bomb went off in my mouth. Not to be gross. The dessert was great and the service was excellent - we got the s'mores dessert. It was my birthday and we actually ordered one to split but there was a miscommunication and all 6 of us ended up getting our own, which we had one bite of (oh, well!).  I went last August and I'm in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Saturday night.  Mon cher chou et moi arrived without reservations.  Silly us!  The hostess said she could fit us in at the chef's counter, by the kitchen, if we wanted, otherwise there would be a very long wait.  We were game-- and ended up getting the coolest seat in the house!

I'm a fan of the recent spate of Gordon Ramsey programs on the Food Network.  The moral of all Ramsey's tales:  running a restaurant is not just about creating really good food, but doing it efficeintly, consistently and well.  To say this kitchen operated like a well oiled machine is simply not good enough.  These fellows exemplified what it meant to work a a team-- seemlessly attending to their own portion of the art while assisting collegues who got in the weeds with nary a misstep.  Amazing!!  

We got a chance to chat with them after the rush-- they were really fantastic!  The chef himself was really nice and obviously in love with what he does.

The food was good, really good!  The polenta crusted calamari was an interesting, crunchy/ chewy take on the classic.  My seared scallops were wonderful-- and there were 6 or 7 giant scallops!  Great value for the money!  The skin-on mashed potatoes were God's food!  the real stand out of the night was Mon cher chou's pretzle crusted trout.  It was moist, tender , flavorful and balanced.  Get that."}
{"text":"My fave restaurant around!  So delicious and inventive.  Nothing has ever been bad here and I'd eat here every time I go out if possilbe! I want to try EVERYTHING on the menu. Not so great for kids (they just wouldn't appreciate the food)  - but the decor is comfy and rustic.  Have also been here for several working meetings and the staff is terrific."}
{"text":"The moment I walked in, I wanted to square dance. This place is hillbilly chic.

I took my fiance here for his birthday because he appreciates a nice cut of meat without all the frills and fufu details. I asked around for a good steakhouse... upon further research, I decided to take him here. In retrospect, I should've taken him to the other steakhouse. 

We ordered a couple of apps: beet salad and a seasonal fried oyster dish (which happened to be the best thing there), and our entrees: me, chicken and him: steak. Nothing special. The birthday dessert is not complimentary, but they will but a candle on it. I ordered the bread pudding because they can add a scoop of ice cream to it, and he likes ice cream. Dessert was not good. 

3 stars= 1. Fried oyster app 2. Catty-corner quasi indoor/outdoor seating 3. Server was nice."}
{"text":"Don't bother. For four years my husband has requested Blue Canyon for his birthday dinner. And for four years we have been denied a window seat. This, even though I reserved a week in advance requesting a table by the window for his birthday. We arrived at 4:45 pm to an empty restaurant and still were denied a window table. The menu is overpriced and not vegetarian or health friendly. After spending $150 each year here and having a bad experience, we won't return."}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment. You walk in and feel as if you have entered the house of a dear old friend who lives on a ranch in Montana. The cabin in the mountains interior overlooks a gorgeous patio with a very well planned out landscape. But then, your food arrives. The lobster and crab bisque tasted like the lobster and crab had been born in that broth. Then they went to school together and graduated together and are now growing old together in that very same broth. This roughly translates to a rancid tasting soup. And then the mushroom pie was floating in something that was denser than the mushrooms itself because the mushrooms were floating. I would def go back for the atmosphere, but I would only order drinks and never order food.

Just FYI, if you are staying at the Hilton Garden Inn next door, if you show the receptionist your receipt from the Blue Canyon, then you get 1000 extra Hilton honors points."}
{"text":"Great food, albeit a bit too salty, but not great service. Really excellent appetizers and salads, but the entrees were salt bombs. Also everything came at the same time. The bread, our appetizers, and our entrees all came within about a minute of each other.
The service left something to be desired. Our waitress had to be reminded numerous times about our order.
The desserts were also great, and I highly recommend the chocolate bomb. We'll have to come check out their happy hour next."}
{"text":"Second visit, first time the place was packed, ordered the short ribs which were good after I sent them back because the food was not even lukewarm. Another in our group had the chicken and sausage skillet, in which the chicken was so overcooked and dry it was inedible. Server only asked about it when clearing the table, too late.

Last night the restaurant was not busy,  ordered wedge salad and tenderloin. Salad appeared tired, balsamic was so strong it was hard to eat. Tenderloin ordered medium rare was over, more like medium well, and not seasoned. Mashed potatoes barely warm.

One glass of wine, salad, small steak with tip 60 dollars.  Expect flavorful hot food, disappointed again

It is a lovely setting, but likely will not try again."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. Service was great and so was the food. Great atmosphere and overall a great place to spend dinner! Ps. Get the prime rib!!!!"}
{"text":"For the most part, I have had good experiences here.  The food is always delicious.  We came here a few years when my guest had a lot of food allergies.  The chef actually came out to our table and wrote down everything that the he could not have and what he could have and made a custom dinner just for him!  And it was so good that I was jealous of having something \"ordinary\" from the menu!  I have been here on several occasions and tried many different dishes, all were great (e.g., Bacon-crusted pork chops, steak, pasta, calamari, soups and more!).

The reason why they do not get 5 stars is that one time, both my guest and I ordered the bacon-crusted pork chops, and it arrived raw right around the bone on both of our orders!  Don't get me wrong... it was still delicious, and of course we didn't see it until we got to the end of the meal.  When I let the waitress know, she simply apologized and that was it. They always give a comment card with every meal, so I filled it out and let them know that the pork chops were undercooked this time around.  I gave it to the hostess when we were leaving, and when I was waiting for the valet to pull the car around, the hostess came up to me to apologize and said that a manager would be in touch with me shortly to make amends.  No one ever followed-up.  I would not have expected that anything would come out of a comment card (let's be realistic... it's rare!), but the hostess set the expectation that a manager would address it, and it was never addressed.  #1 principle of any service-related business: under promise and over deliver.  That clearly did not happen in this case.

I would have probably given them 3 stars, but their food really is very good.  And I have been there several times, I suppose they can't be perfect every time!

Also, if it is a holiday or if you tell them that you are celebrating a special occasion, they will come to your table to take a picture and mail it to you!  It's a nice keepsake and service!"}
{"text":"Just had our worst Sunday brunch ever. Our server was rude. The food selection is poor and food taste just ok comparing to the price for each person. We waited forever for the server to take our payment and we ended up with paying cash because we could not wait anymore. I would never come to this place again."}
{"text":"We went here last Friday night and sat in the bar area.  They weren't busy - I saw several people walking around \"checking\" on things.  It took several minutes for us to get our server over - no water etc. until then.  Our server had ZERO wine experience, not even the basics.  He admitted that he doesn't drink wine.  I would think basic wine knowledge would be required to be a server. The food was ok - nothing special - but the service was horrendous.  The menus sat on our table throughout the meal, dirty glasses remained, dirty dishes.  At one point I looked over and our server was leaning against something in the bar - rather than checking/cleaning his tables.  I would not return."}
{"text":"Gosh, a fancy place that is legitimately good in this area? That's about as rare as a politician who doesn't lie! 

Anywho, Blue Canyon is amazing. I was concerned that this place would mostly be hype and have little substance to it, but I was happily wrong. We came here for my parents birthdays and we got a nice table by a big set of windows. Our server was very nice and she knew everything about the menu and the specials--and we asked a ton of questions. She was also one of those kinds of servers that is very engaging and she had no problem engaging both my elderly grandfather and my picky parents. It was really fun to watch!

The food here is just top notch. A lot of it changes due to seasonality (as it should in a place like this), and I was really excited by their changing game meat section. They had some kind of wild boar while we were there (which I got) and I loved it.

We ordered: Lobster and Crawfish Bisque, Cast Iron Cheese Bake, BC Yukon Potato Chips, Wild Game Feature, Brick Oven Faroe Island Salmon, Bacon and Pasta, and the Roasted Cauliflower and Summer Squash.

The bisque was good, but I've had better other places (but there isn't anything wrong with this one). The cast iron cheese bake was F****** amazing. It was oily and cheesy and heart clogging and delicious--how could it not be? The blue cheese potato chips were also out of this world. My Dad pretty much destroyed them before anyone else got to try any, they were that good. I've already mentioned the game feature and how I was pleased with that. Both my Dad and my Grandfather got the salmon and they loved it. I could see even from across the table that it was perfectly cooked (it had that translucent color). The bacon and pasta was exactly what you would expect, delicious. However if you're looking for a 'light' option--that item is not for you (neither is the cheese bake). And for all you vegetarians out there, the roasted cauliflower and squash is so good. The curry spices on it are very complementary and both my Mom and I enjoyed it very much.

So if you're looking for something new, someplace nice to go for a special occasion, or just really good food, check out the Blue Canyon. I don't see how anyone could be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I was excited to give this place another try because the reviews are so good!  I was with a large group for dinner and drinks over the weekend.  They had a spread of hors d'oeuvres on a table right when you walked in with some pinwheels, flat breads, crab cakes, and some type of sandwiches.  The crab cakes were hard and cold. The pinwheels consisted of chives, roast beef, and cream cheese.  The roast beef was very dry.  I didn't try the other two appetizers.  The service just doesn't match the price tag here for me.  Once again the service was not so great.  The bartender was rude and so were the servers. The server didn't even ask us how we wanted our steaks prepared.  She literally ran away before I could tell her. I got the filet as my entree and it was nicely prepared.  It was a Little more well done than I prefer but still very good.  The portions are smaller but it just left room for the wonderful dessert they served after dinner.  

In the end I will not be going out of my way to dine here again.  They do offer quality food but the service is lacking"}
{"text":"Food fantastic, service fantastic, ambience fantastic. Only complant is portions small. For instance, my side of vegetables, green beans, why be cheap with green beans? the dessert portions were huge along with the appeitizer. Overall it was really good and we will return. By the way always check yelp and opentable for reservations for some reason they both have different times available."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious.  We just had our wedding reception for 75 guests and the service, attention to detail and food was incredible!  They know how to make a special event seem so seamless."}
