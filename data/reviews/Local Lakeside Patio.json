{"text":"Everything was as we expected last Saturday; Drinks came out quickly, food was tasty and the view was great.  Our server was funny and polite and really took care of us.  Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"I write this as I wait. And wait. And wait. It is the first day of the season they are sorry service is very slow. Strike that. Very slow doesn't describe it. We have been waiting at least 40 minutes. They have thought to bring out anything for the kids like the fries we ordered. Even a hamburger bun would be welcome. Stay away from this place at all costs unless you just had a snack and mind a long wait."}
{"text":"Good location but super slow service and I didn't receive cutlery and napkins with my meal, food was ok!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink on the patio. They have a few cocktails on the menu but stick to the beers and you should be fine!"}
{"text":"They advertise \"handmade artisanal thin crust pizza\" out the front. But the pizza tastes exactly like cheap frozen pizza from the store, and the crust isn't exactly thin crust.   The view however is nice... Right by the lake.   Wings were pretty decent"}
{"text":"Great patio right next to the live music. A fun Sunday  afternoon. A few empty tables, I was surprised it wasn't packed with a line up considering the wait at Amsterdam Brewery. Cold beer and fish tacos"}
{"text":"The location is the only good thing about this restaurant, great view of the water and the CN tower.  The food however is awful! Coleslaw lacked any sort of flavour, the fish and chips batter was not tasty and was soggy the tartar sauce lacked the proper flavour. The service was slow, we were given one small glass of water and never offered a refill."}
{"text":"Beautiful day in Toronto and we were sat quickly. Our waiter (who, despite everything that was going on around him) was great. We got some drinks and ordered a burger and fish tacos. 45 minutes later, the burger came out.   No complaints - it was great, and with good weather a small wait is ok. Was told that the fish tacos were 'coming right up' more than 3 times. After the burger plate was cleared, they admitted that they're pretty sure that the kitchen lost the chit. Totally fine - but when we asked if there was anything we could order that would be faster, that wasn't an option.   90 minutes after we were sat, and no less than 4 tables received their fish tacos, I spoke with a manager. They comp'd a great deal of the bill, but that's unacceptable.   Amazing view and great for drinks and conversation - avoid ordering food at all costs."}
{"text":"Went there after a Jays game. Full house patio, service was slower took about 10 mins for drinks to arrive, another 20 for food... Got the cheese burger with additional caramelized onions & mushrooms. The meat was a little dry, additional add ons were not worth the 2.50.. Fries were good. Our coronas didn't come with lemons.. Had to ask for ketchup multiple times.. And server didn't bring an item that we ordered. Not recommended if the place is busy.."}
{"text":"Really bad quality food. And overpriced. Great if you just want a beer and a patio but that is it!"}
{"text":"Since the Spicy Food Festival was lacking, well, food, we decided to stop in here for dinner.  Yes, it sits on the water and has great views but the food and wait time was subpar.    We were encouraged to order quickly as the food would take a while.  Two of us ordered fish tacos but then learned that they were \"out of stock\" so my friend went with a pizza and I ordered wings.  I can't comment on the taste of anyone else's food but the fish and chips and caesar salad looked good.  Pizza - meh ... my \"one pound\" of wings were more like half pound.  They were room temperature and had no seasoning.  The saving grace was that they were cooked to perfection - only if they added salt ... I didn't complain because I knew it would take an additional hour just to get another serving. The beer on tap could have been colder as well.  All in all, prices are decent and a nice place to hang out by the waterfront.  Very good for tourists.  P.S. I thought this was really odd: my friend asked to pack up the rest of her pizza so they gave her a container but said they couldn't provide a bag because they don't offer take-out on the weekends.  So you only have bags in stock Monday to Friday?"}
{"text":"Food isn't very good.  Fish tacos and brisket burger were a little nasty.  BUT the location is nice.  If you're looking for a place to get some drinks with friends, then I recommend this place.  But have dinner elsewhere first."}
