{"text":"Had dinner here with some friends and we all left very pleased with our meals. The cheese plate was very tasty with an atypical selection (could have included more crackers though).  I ordered the seafood pasta and it was probably the best I have ever tried.  It was flavourful, a little on the spicy side, with a decent amount of seafood.  Another person in our party had the arctic char and thought it too was great with its accompanying vegetables.  We also had the tiramisu, which was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Food was great and so was the service. Bread was a little dry but all in all a fantastic experience. Canolo (their version of cannoli) was excellent although a wee bit different than a true cannoli."}
{"text":"Totally delighted to have a delicious restaurant near my workplace! We had the family style t-bone steak, grilled fillet, roasted potatoes, roasted vegetables, the seafood platter to begin with, and a few other delectables.   Will return!"}
{"text":"Taverna Mercatto is conveniently located which is how we came to eat here. Gazing upon the menu we had very high hopes!  My wife got the Gluten Free Penne Di Mare which was a terrible rice blend that was undersalted. The mussels, squid, crab and scallop was fine to say the most.  I ordered the Vongale - a squid ink pasta with clams, guanciale and fresh chili's. The guanciale was criminally undercooked and the pasta bland; however the clams and chili's were a saving grace.  Dessert came and it managed to save this review from a 2 star as my wife's caramel gelato and my connolo were excellent if slow to arrive.   Here's what to come for...an excellent beer selection and nothing else."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but the dessert was underwhelming. I ordered the trio assortment of gelato and of all the flavours she named beforehand, she brought three flavours that were not named. This would normally not be a big deal except she brought hazelnut and my friend is allergic to nuts and took a bite not expecting it to be hazelnut. My friend ordered the tiramisu which was very runny."}
{"text":"Good service, but mediocre food for way too much money.  We had the margherita pizza, ragu and carbonara. The pizza was made with a spicy red sauce, cheap mozzarella and two basil leaves. It tasted like a typical greasy red sauce pizza. The ragu was rich but was ultimately not interesting enough for $18. Carbonara is a tough dish to get right and ultimately they copped out by not even making the sauce. The portions are very underwhelming as well. Ultimately the food is just not worth the prices they are charging. There is a much better option just up the street."}
{"text":"My new favourite Italian restaurant  Located between the ACC and Skydome, Taverna is the perfect spot for a business lunch, a romantic dinner pre-concert or a game night out with friends. Entering, my friend and I were immediately thrilled by the gothic inspired decor filled with found objects and dramatic chandeliers. Too early for our reservation we first sat at the bar overlooking the buzzing open kitchen, ordered some vino and a few dish of the bar menu. Their chicken thighs were fantastic, a good amount of meat and the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. If you want something more decadent, get their succulent fried artichoke and dip. When the friendly hostess finally directed us to our table, I saw the banquets were made out of reconstructed church pews, how fun is that!? I've been a regular Mercatto customer for a couple years and looking at the dinner menu, I was super happy to find my favourite items topped by a good amount of unknown new dishes. We were really excited they now offer big items to share like a full roast chicken or T-bone. We wanted something fresh so chose the whole fish, garnished with clams and vegetables. Beautifully plated and served with antique silver cutlery, it reminded me so much of home when my mom used to cook all day for a celebration. Great memories revived thanks to executive chef Doug Neigel and chef de cuisine Jackie Chau. Taverna with it's fab decor, extensive wine list, beautiful ingredients cooked the right way, really is a great addition to the Mercatto family. It's officially my new favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto and I'll be back, no doubt about that!"}
{"text":"Had a work get-together here and it was a great night out!   We were seated in the semi-private room and it was excellent as we could enjoy each other's company and have dinner with our group. The ambience of the restaurant is wonderful and warm.   The food was excellent (I had the lemon ricotta ravioli) and staff were fantastic."}
{"text":"Had lunch here at the bar this past Friday. The place was buzzing and the barkeeps were great. A pretty standard tap list with some fun surprises.  The 'Friday special' burger and fries was AMAZING - even at $21. It's 50% ground brisket and 50% ground short rib. The truffle butter and brioche bun rounded out the best lunch I've had in a looong time.  Glad to have Taverna in the work hood - I'll be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Sorry it does.  looks great from the outside but that's it. The pizza looks like it isn't so bad, but the pastas were both brutal. No flavour and the beef was dry. For the price point there are a TONNE of better options for Italian."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and left hungry.  I had the ravioli which came to a ridiculous $21 for 4 raviolis...it wasn't even that good.  I'm not a big eater by any means but that's completely unreasonable.  I did mention it to the waitress and I got a shrug and a \"that's the portion\".   A couple people in our group had pizzas, I didn't try it myself but it looked a little sad...just not as sad as my 4 raviolis.  The tiramisu was ok, personally I didn't think it was great but maybe it was just mine since everyone here raves about it."}
{"text":"3.5/5! I definitely agree with a lot of the other reviewers - this is one of the best restaurants near ACC & Rogers Centre. It has a fantastic ambiance, good service and it is great for large groups. It is also a good place to go for after-work drinks. The pastas and pizzas all looked delicious. I recommend the Pappardelle. Unfortunately, this place lost 1.5 stars because I was somewhat disappointed with my main (don't order the pork). I am going back in 2 weeks for a farewell party and I will be sure to stick to the pizzas & pastas. I will update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant that's close to Air Canada Centre and Rogers Centre. It's a convenient spot to go before a game.   The service is friendly and efficient. The decor is very nice.   The food is very good. The pizza is delicious and so is the seafood linguine. The prices are reasonable.   I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Large restaurant. Seating outside is nice, looks out on Bremner and depending on where you sit you can see the ACC jumbotron. Seating inside has a nice atmosphere too. We had the duck ragu and the butchers' ragu. Both were decent, but nothing memorable. Price was great for the area. So I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"There are such a small amount of times when you eat a meal like the ones they sell at Taverna Mercatto. Tonight, I ate the Duck Ragu and it was TO DIE FOR! The duck was fresh and tender, placed on top of a bed of thick pasta and melting shredded cheese on top. It was really a well crafted meal- I was considering hugging the chef! My family also ate the Spicy chicken, which was also EXTREMELY TENDER and FRESH. We also dined on fish- so fresh it was like they had just pulled it from the Sea. As my first time and meal in Canada, I hope that it will set the standard for food in Toronto. I would also like to thank the friendly and happy waiter that was very nice to my family and I. She made sure my water was filled and ready to drink! The atmosphere in this restaurant is happy and alive, you are guaranteed to smile. If you see this review...PLEASE GO HERE! YOU WILL WANT TO COME BACK!  No, we aren't done yet... now let's talk dessert. I ordered the Gelato eSorbetto while the rest of my family ordered the Tiramisu, Budino, and the Canolo. It was okay...but if you REALLY want to order dessert, don't waste your calories on other desserts...GET THE CANOLO! IT IS SOOO GOOD! Crispy Canoli shell topped with powdered sugar. The filling- apricot mascropone with white chocolate and pistachio- was amazing! So, if you want dessert, ONLY GET THE CANOLO!  -----------------------  List of food I ordered (and recommend): 1. Duck Ragu  2. Spicy Chicken 3. Fish (fingerling potatoes, micro greens, celery purée)  Desert: 1. Budino 2. Gelato eSorbetto 3. Tiramisu  4. Canollo (GET IT!)"}
{"text":"Guest of four. Overall impression was OK, not bad. Decor was unique, service was efficient but not very friendly. Noise level was high, so it was very difficult to hear each other. Food was OK. Carbonara was good, squid ink pasta over done. Char fish OK to good. Its a nice addition to an area with not much other option close by."}
{"text":"I went to experience this place today for lunch with a friend, food was decent, but service was bad when it came to an incident where I ordered pappardelle braised duck ragu, padano, I had encountered a very sharp bone that looked like a dagger in my mouth, when I was eating this dish. I brought it to the attention of the persons who worked there and quickly put the bone in his pocket, nothing was done about the situation, good thing I didn't choke on that bone. It didn't happen, thank god. Just thought it was strange the way the situation was dealt with. Nothing was done and my friend and I just paid our bill. So just wanting to warn anybody who eats at this resteraunt , they  are not the most careful with their food and I feel the situation was not handled properly either, my friend and I felt very taken back, they acted like nothing happened, I would think,  it was not a good thing to have a customer get jabbed in the mouth by a sharp bone when your eating a pasta dish.Service was not professional in my opinion, and being a foodie, I appreciate excellent service, with excellent food. So if you happen to try this place, please search through your pasta, and make sure, that no bones or any other crazy objects are in your food.!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is far too highly priced for the portion size. The portions are small. Added to that: the flavors were a little muted; I felt that I could make a better dish of pasta from scratch myself. Our server was pleasant, but a little snooty and would often pass duties off to other staff members -- staff that ended up bringing us the wrong dish, and the wrong drink. Pluses: the atmosphere is great & the bar is nice, although the washroom was rather hard to find. I probably won't return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere but the food ia only so - so. Dined recently with a group of friends and all but two of the meals came out cold. I had the cavatelli with the beef cheeks. It was mediocre. You can get better food at the same prices elsewhere."}
{"text":"I normally go to Real Sports Bar prior to a game at the Air Canada Centre.  It was booked so went to Taverna Mercatto as a secondary option.  Reservations were available a couple of days prior.  Place looked full when I got there (Friday at 6:00pm).    Décor is nice, modern yet casual.  Lively atmosphere.  Staff was friendly and my table was ready even though I arrived early.  I ordered the linguine seafood dish.  It was quite good and enough seafood to ensure there is some with every bite.  My only comment would be that I would have preferred a bit more quantity as I was still hungry after (but I did not order an appetizer).  Good selection of wine and lots of craft beer options.  I believe for my friend and myself, dinner plus beer and tax (before tip) was $60.  While Real Sports is a fun place to go before a game, it can be loud and difficult to have a conversation - Taverna Mercatto can be a good alternative.  I would recommend.  As a note, if you are going to the ACC and it is poor weather, you can go through the Telus building and get to the ACC through the above ground PATH walkway."}
{"text":"Only eat here if you're on a FULL stomach.  What a huge disappointment!  I ordered the pasta with marinara and got about 7 mouthfuls.  Complained to the waiter but nothing was done about it."}
{"text":"After a concert at the Air Canada centre  last night we were hoping to get a beer and a bite, there was none on the patio and we were pleasantly surprised that we could sit outside. The seating, lighting and music level were great, staff friendly and helpful as we just wanted to share a couple of appetizers. Apparently the hopbot beer was great, wine that was recommended in place of my preferred Malbec was perfect. However, the only thing I would say that the last time here on a Thursday night the music was a bit loud to chat. Would I go back? Definitely."}
{"text":"Came on a weekday for a lunch date with a friend. We picked this place to try black squid ink pasta which they said was freshly made on the menu! My friend had a carbonara and I went for the squid ink. It was a bit underwhelming. The portion sizes were medium to small but the ambiance and service is really nice.   Both of us agreed we'd had better pasta elsewhere. Maybe the pizzas are a better choice?   There is definitely a mad lunch rush with all the offices around but there wasn't a wait which was nice. The interior is spacious and the tables are a good size but it can get quite noisy during the rush. Try going at 1 or 11 to avoid. The server was nice and food came at a good time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Sat on patio. Funky and modern interior design. Quite the spot for business people downtown during the week. Nice variety of items on lunch menu. Decent wine list. Service was good. Had wine and the antipasti grande. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday for lunch. it wasn't busy and we were seated quickly.   We ordered the Salsiccia Pizza and the Pappardelle pasta. Both were delicious and the pasta came with a generous amount of duck.   My only complaint was the wait for our food. We waited over 45 minutes and the restaurant was only about half full. The waitress never checked on us. By the time our food came, we were starving and had to scarf it all down because we had to get back to the office. I don't suggest coming here for a quick lunch, but since the food was good, I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"We popped in here due to weather and it being close to our hotel. Very pleasantly surprised, decor very nice, we had no reservations, but got great seats at the bar. Very glad we sat there because Danny the bartender was amazing. Helped us pick the wine-and it was great. Also they had new fall menu- he made some suggestions which we took and were very pleased with those choices. Topped off with deserts for a wonderful evening. Thanks Danny!"}
{"text":"The interior is modern and fancy, but the food is disappointing. I had the squid ink linguine alle Vongoli. The portion was so small that I got hungry 30 mins after the dinner. The pasta was too greasy and not enough seasoned. I don't get the crispy crouton thing on the pasta. Why is there such a thing on linguine alle Vongoli ? Well, this is def not the best Vongoli I've had. In terms of pasta, Terroni beats it."}
{"text":"Very nice place!  Ordered the chitara alla carbonara and thought it was great! Also am a total sucker for egg, so that was a nice touch.  Our table got the meatballs to share and those were good! Would say a little difficult to share with the bread, but would recommend ordering.  Waitstaff were really kind and courteous, also have to say the ambiance of the place was really nice!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with my wife. Nice decor (hence the 1 star).  They asked us if we had reservations - to which we answered no.  We were seated immediately. Within 5 minutes the waitress came to give us water and we placed our order.  We waited 30 minutes and still no food.  When we asked the waitress how much longer, we were told the kitchen is backed up and they said \"as soon as possible\".  Unfortunately we had to get back to work and left after 45 minutes of waiting.  Don't come here if you only have 1 hour for lunch.  What a disappointment....we are still hungry!"}
{"text":"Decor was on point with cute chandeliers and a \"farm to table\" feel. Great location located downtown near the CN Tower. Staff was attentive and quick. My Linguine di Mare entree was flavorful and the fresh pepper added a nice kick - yum! Unfortunately, the calamari (extremely salty), tiramisu (watery???), and cheesecake (ridiculously tart) were not what I expected."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a bunch of friends and had pretty high hopes because of the great reviews. However everything was mediocre.  We ordered the calamari to share, which was pretty good. They were just as crispy as I hoped and was the highlight of my meal.   For my entree, I got the linguini de mare (seafood pasta) and it was pretty bland... the flavour of the sauce was not strong enough and the seafood was over cooked and flavourless as well.   My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti e bufala and it was also pretty bland and nothing special.  The price seemed reasonable when I looked at the menu online- $15-20 per dish. However the portions are SMALL. As soon as it arrived to the table, I thought \"that's it?\". I'm usually not a big eater but even I was still hungry after the meal!"}
{"text":"Good find for lunch while walking around. This restaurant offers brunch on Saturdays until 4 pm. They have a nice variety and good atmosphere. Seating was quick as the restaurant was not busy at all around 1pm. I ordered the brioche French toast and a side of fruit. The entire bill was about $20 including tip so I'd say it was priced pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food! Service was great, very friendly servers. Will be back again. The rib eye was cooked correctly and had alot of favor without any sauce. The oysters were fresh and meaty."}
{"text":"An Italian restaurant with the decor of a Grandma Lees!  For this price I would have thought they could have had a more modern decor.  Don't pay the designer.  However the food is really good.  I have had the Carbonara a number of times and it is always delicious.    Had a group dinner there with an assortment of appetizers.  Were all very good.  Service was very professional although had one experience at lunch where it took far longer than expected."}
{"text":"A bit upscale restaurant serves Italian cuisine. The restaurant is gorgeous and very modern and spacious! There is available seating outside as well with plenty of room. I sat outside and the seats were in the shade so it did not feel too hot! Thank goodness!!   The menu is great! There were plenty of options to choose from and they have different endless amount of drinks and a beautiful full bar. I ordered the Spagetti Bufala which is just regular Spagetti. My dish was good and the perfect amount, not overwhelming! Before the main course we ordered the cheese board that I highly recommend! It comes with jam and coated walnuts that my friends loved (I personally don't eat walnuts). The cheeseboard was a perfect appetizer and it was 6 of us! The wine was perfect with the cheese!   The service was great! We loved our waitress she was so nice and always checked on us. The food was served quickly too.   The food wasn't pricey but the quality was great!   Overall I enjoyed the experience and I would recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"I've been here two times so far, and counting! The last time I was here was with some family friends for a weekend lunch. We were lucky it wasn't very busy and we got a corner window table.  We decided to order a bunch of dishes to share - beet salad, calamari, a couple of pizzas, pasta carbonara, lamb, and of course, a bottle of Chianti (afternoon drinking FTW - there's a reason we all get along so well). Everything was pretty good! We all enjoyed the food and had a good time. I think my favourites were the calamari and the pasta.  The other time I was here, we had lots of fun and enjoyed our meals. Consistently good times here so far!"}
{"text":"There's three sessions of this restaurant, indoor dinning, indoor bar area and outdoor. I saw the booth on the left bar session and requested to sit there with my two young kids. BIG Mistake!! My table at the back were way toooooo noisy. I should have asked to change a table which would be so much nicer on the other side. Food-wise, it's not nearly impressive. We ordered the Arctic Char and the fresh squid ink linguine which highly recommended on the menu plus one extra pasta with sausage and pepperoni. Have to say everything is just on the average side. It's still a very nice modern and chic restaurant but I think, in all, I should not set my bar too high."}
{"text":"Service rapide et courtois. Nous avons adoré la nourriture et la serveuse. Nous n'avions pas de réservation un samedi soir et ils nous ont placé dans la salle à mangé."}
{"text":"Location location location!!! This is the only thing going for this place.    Finally got to enjoy a patio in this year. Right off of bremner, the streets were buzzing with people. With the fire pits going...this was an enjoyable spot!  The food was ok. Had the wood oven pizza, tasted like any other. Had the antipasto, like any other. I did ask them to replace the prosciutto with grilled veggies....they gave me a few walnuts instead :/  this was just nuts !!!   Service was ok. The server didn't know the menu to well when I asked her about the dishes. And parking is insanely expensive so carpool! I parked in the delta next door, $10 after six.   If your in the area, enjoy the patio. Have a drink and some munchies.   Good for a group hangout :)"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and was quite pleased.  Good menu with lots of varied choice.  We had the carbonara and the mussels with the charcuterie as an appetizer.  All was good. Portions are a good size. Sommelier was very good and made an excellent choice for us. My only comments would be that the restaurant is noisy and it was at time tough to hear conversation and the service was not the best. I made the reservation a week before and not sure how we ended up being seated in the bar area.  Rarely we were checked in and we waited about 15 minutes after we were completely finished and even then it wasn't our waitress. We were not offered dessert or coffee."}
{"text":"This place is lovely! The interior decor is really funky and modern and is a nice Intimate setting for a night out or date! They have a nice selection of  Appys and drinks to pair. Service is friendly and helpful if you need suggestions for items and was very fast all evening. It's a pretty big space for dt so it's pretty good for big groups or gatherings. It is slightly pricey but is a lovely spot for a special occasion of outing!"}
{"text":"I had heard such great things about this restaurant and really wanted to try it out. It's located next to the Delta hotel and steps away from Rogers Centre and Real Sports. The pasta we had was undercooked -- both the ravioli and the squid ink spaghetti. We had to send it back to the kitchen to be redone. Flavour-wise, the food was okay. It didn't wow me but also didn't disappoint. The staff is nice and were quick to respond when we asked for the pasta to be redone. Overall, I think I would give it another go and possibly order a dish that wasn't pasta. I heard the lamb was good!"}
{"text":"Rustic style Italian restaurant. Haven't try out the pizza, but I see a lot of people ordering it. It is a decent size and looks good. Recommend you to try the restaurant's recommendations. Be ware of the kids' portion, the half size portion is too small for any kid older than 6."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere. Good food, excellent pizza, service can be a little quicker. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and was not disappointed. Service was spot on and the food was delicious. We had the heirloom caprese salad which was perfectly seasoned and fresh. I had the artic char and my husband had the spicy chicken and we both cleaned our plates. Wonderfully balanced meals and just all around perfect. We will definitely eat here again next time we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"When I walked in here on a Monday night with my friend, I was shocked at the size of this place! It's monstrous! But I think that they do a lot more business when games get out and people pile in all at once. On this night, it was pretty bare bones.  I should have asked for a different table because I hate being sandwiched next to a wall. Especially when the place in empty. But I get that they have to seat certain server's sections in rotation and my friend was happy with the seat so I sucked it up.  The menu looked good and the server was happy to recommend a bottle of wine for us to share.  We had the beet and burrata salad, which was quite nice, but the charcuterie board was pretty stingy for $26. Three tiny pieces of cheese and the meat was laid out flat to cover the board over and fool you into thinking there was more food than there really was. A few small olives and one small piece of pickled cauliflower. Kinda sad. We also partook in the Diavola pizza. It was good. Definitely not the best pizza I've had and certainly not the worst, either. The inside of the pie was a little gooey.  Generally, I like Mercatto for their value and the wines by the glass. Perhaps I we would have had more success sitting at the bar, as the server didn't seem very knowledgeable about all of the selections. I've also found that the value for money is good, but not on this occasion. Perhaps the prices here are designed to gaugue the sports fan who's already been fooled by spending $15 for a tiny beer.  I probably would visit the other locations again, but not this one."}
{"text":"Loved the Mozzarella cheese, beets and arugula appetizer (: split a prosciutto pizza, also split the lamb raviolis- my favorite dish were the raviolis  great service- beautiful scenery- extremely attentive and happy staff :)"}
{"text":"Excellent choices for food and drink and exceptional service. Can't say enough about the Pork Chop and I know my wife really enjoyed the lamb shank. Will be a challenge to decide between here and e11even when we're down for events at the ACC."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to try it at first because of the 3.5 star rating. I took the plunge and it was worth it. The seafood pasta is absolutely amazing. The Vongole pasta is also very good. Good price for positions, good service. I recommend this resto !! Have funn"}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood linguini. The waiter was very nice and personable. Even though the restaurant seemed full, the orders came quickly. We sat on the patio near the street so it was a bit loud but a nice environment. The pasta itself was great. The sauce wasn't too heavy and the mussels and other seafood was a very good complement to the dish. I've had many seafood linguini dishes and this one did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, a restaurant experience is typically 50% about food and remaining about Service and Setting... While I would give full points to the service and setting, I think the food was average.  We ordered for beet root salad, pizza and Italian Rice balls. The beet root salad was off balance on balasmic vinegar and the pizza had a bitter herb, which I did not like.   The rice balls helped in satisfying the meal, but I ended up picking up desserts at next door Soho."}
{"text":"The servant didn't have appropriate behavior and led us the worst seat at the bar however there are many seats were available and she said you can't change the table but at first she mentioned you can just seat here for a while and then we prepare for you table by reservation but she didn't care what she said first and twisted the truth"}
{"text":"Pretty good! The ambiance here is very nice - trendy, modern, and a touch upscale. There's a generous amount of bar seating and outdoor seating available.   Portion sizes are a little small for what you pay, but the food was delicious. I had the pappardelle pasta with duck ragu and my boyfriend had the pollo fra diavolo (spicy chicken). We also shared the veal and pork meatballs as an appetizer. Service here is very prompt and our waitress was super friendly. We had a million and one requests, all of which she fulfilled quickly. My only complaint is that tables have to request bread, rather than it just being provided from the start of the meal.   The veal and pork meatballs were a tad overcooked, but the sauce that complemented it was delicious. It's served in a mini cast iron pan, which was cute. I loved my pappardelle pasta - definitely tasted fresh and did not skimp on the duck meat. My boyfriend's chicken was cooked perfectly - very juicy and tender and the kitchen was able to accommodate his request to use less cream.   All in all, this is a cute little eatery just down the street from the CN Tower with many other locations around the city. I would definitely eat here again if I were in the area and craving Italian!"}
{"text":"2.5. Rounded up to 3 for ambiance. Had the lamb dish for $28 or $29, and it was underwhelming. It was cooked to medium  (although I had asked for medium rare). There was not much taste to the lamb. It didn't have any lamb flavour. It sat on a bed of grains and carrots which also seemed to lack in flavour.  Also tried the pork chop dish because my friend ordered it. The salad it came with was nice. The fries were overdone (too crispy and dry). The pork chop itself was a bit dry.  That being said about the food, the decor was nice and it's a convenient location."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the service was really fantastic. The server suggested a great wine and was very attentive to our needs. The food on the other hand, was not good.  I ordered the carbonara, which I had previously ordered at the Mercatto on Toronto street and enjoyed. Unfortunately the carbonara arrived and tasted like burnt garlic; there were visible black flecks throughout the pasta. When I raised this to the waiter, he immediately had the dish re-made for me. When it arrived at the table, it was only marginally better with burnt pancetta. Had our waiter not been so kind, I would have refused to pay for the dish as I only ate about 1/4 and was no long appetized.   We did however order the meatballs as a starter and they were phenomenal. If I ever end up here again, I will take the meatballs and wine please."}
{"text":"A nice upscale Italian place in the heart of Toronto.  I highly recommend the tuna or the pork.  The pasta dishes are likewise well-spiced and have an interesting flavor."}
{"text":"This place was near my hotel so I gave it a try. When I first walked in, I didn't realize the hostess stand was all the way to the left and instead I paused by the stack of menus. I finally realized so that was a little odd as far as placement. I was seated outside on the covered patio, which was very nice and had a cozy feel. I was poured water quickly. My waiter was friendly and came over quickly as well. Food came out pretty fast too. They had no problems substituting potatoes for a salad. The sauce my steak came with was very flavorful too and really surprised me on the first bite. I did have a section of steak that was tough to cut through but by the time I got to it I was full and mostly it didn't bother me. Overall, a very good meal."}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday night at around 6 for a little date night. The restaurant was probably half full, with people clearing out for the upcoming raptors game.   We got seated at a booth which was really nice and intimate. It was comfy and also had outlets for phone charging! Very nice touch there.   We decided to get the lamb rack entree and the berkshire pork entree. The lamb rack was cooked to perfection, and the veggies and grains (Im not really sure what it actually was) served as satisfying side dishes.   I had a taste of the berkshire pork and it was extremely tender, and the fries were crispy, skinny and seasoned well.   For dessert, we decided to get the cannoli and the ricotta cheesecake. It was so yummy! The ricotta cheese was light, but had the right amount of cheesy taste. I think I prefer this more than a new york style cheesecake.   Overall, great place to come with friends or to have a little date night. Great italian food! I'd love to come back for some pizza and pasta next time!"}
{"text":"Staff is nice but the food is just ok, maybe  less vinegar on the salad and appetizers would be better...find them too sour...nice patio though"}
{"text":"I didn't like our server that afternoon, and that set the tone for the entire meal and this post.   He had this air of superiority over us, (and I'm only guessing here) because we didn't want alcohol during a work related lunch, we didn't want soft drinks (didn't want all that sugar), and just went for the Toronto's finest water. We skimped on the dessert because we just weren't that hungry.   Having a clumsy waiter was slightly annoying, but to have a dirty fork fall off a plate and onto a diner (in their clean pristine work outfit) is inexcusable.   Food was just OK. It's better than the food court, but it's just that, OK. Tolerable because we needed a restaurant with service and a place to talk."}
{"text":"A few friends and I were looking for places in the area for dinner after work and we decided to come here. We walked in and were shown to our table immediately by one of the staff which was great, however it took forever for the server to come and take our orders. Luckily we weren't in a rush. We decided on this place because the menu online seemed pretty reasonable for what seemed like an above average Italian restaurant. We started off with the calamari which was really good - as per all the reviews, but the main dishes were quite disappointing. I got the carbonara, and although the taste and quality were decent, the whole dish was probably enough to feed a 3 year old. The restaurant is over-priced and over-rated, and they don't even have complimentary bread/olive oil/balsamic vinegar which is pretty much a staple at any Italian restaurant. Wouldn't recommend coming here on an empty stomach unless you feel like spending $100 to walk out with a full one."}
{"text":"I visited Taverna Mercatto on a Saturday evening at around 6:30pm with 3 friends to have a pre-concert meal. We were accommodated on the very cute patio immediately (the inside is also a very nice space), and the staff were all really nice. I never felt rushed and my water glass was always full (yay).   My friends and I shared the burrata beet salad, and I had a margherita pizza, my friends had spaghetti buffalo and the squid ink pasta dishes. The salad was really well done, and my pizza was decent, though I have had better. My friends said the same about their pastas.   My main issue was that after I ate the entire pizza...I was still hungry!  Huh??? I mean, I can really eat, but usually I can only finish about half of a pizza.  I was really disappointed because after a $20+ meal, I would hope to feel at least satisfied, but I felt like I hadn't even eaten. I was kind of embarassed about this and thought that it must just be me who has a black hole stomach and was still hungry, but then the others in my party echoed my exact sentiments! We were all very surprised to feel this way.  TLDR: cute place, nice service & ambience, don't go hungry or you will leave hungry :("}
{"text":"Came here to get out of the cold with gfs lol... the place was not packed so initially we were worried the food won't be good but turns out they had great pizza and extensive selection of beer. I went for the salted caramel peanut ice cream though. It was topped with marshmallow...very yummy. My companions also seem to enjoy their pizza and drinks"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight wanting a change from the hotel restaurant. It's close and a fun restaurant. A little loud for me but everyone there seemed to enjoy it. Zsolt was a great waiter and recommended the Octopus as the appetizer and the chicken diavolo as the main.  The octopus was okay. It was tasty but a little tough. The pasta underneath and sauce were food. The chicken though was amazing! There is a sauce that was quite spice and was a wonderful surprise. I'd go back just for that dish."}
{"text":"Good place to go before a game. Pizza is good and service is fast. Summer patio is nice as well."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!   Was my first time here, for Mother's Day actually, and I was really impressed by how great the food tasted (we had brunch). I came with a big group so I got to try a couple of different dishes and everything I ate--the insalata di salmon and French toast being my favourite--was so flavourful and hearty. I got the blueberry, lime and banana smoothie to drink which was made to perfection (didn't taste like an overly sweet, processed drink).   Service was so good. Food came out fast after it was ordered and our waitress was nice as well.   Overall I would % come back! I'm even excited to try dinner."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my friend's on a game day so it was a generally packed with customer's but not to full where you have to scream to talk to your friends. The decor was pretty, decorated with many old fashioned light bulbs and pots on the wall.   For appetizers everyone got the Italian style  meatballs. The meatballs were cooked fine but the sauce on top of the meatballs didn't have much seasoning in it and didn't add any flavour to the meatballs but everyone else loved them so you probably will too. For main course 2 of my friends and I had the margarita pizza which was so good it wasn't overwhelmingly cheesy like some pizza's I've had and there was a perfect amount of sauce. The dough surprisingly added another taste to the pizza it had a good charred taste that tasted really good with the sweetness of the sauce. Overall one of the best pizzas I've ever had. You will probably really enjoy it so I recommend you get it. It was a 5 star pizza. One of my friends had one of the pastas, I don't recall which one but what I remember was that it was brown and it had a raw egg on it. When it came I realized it was surprisingly small. He ate the pasta in about 5 minutes, he told me that he only got 6 spoonfuls of pasta. He ended up having to share with someone who got a pizza that couldn't finish it. For dessert we got a tirimisu to share and I got a canolo for myself. The Conolo wasn't as great as some of my friends had said it was. It was just some crust with a paste on the inside. Nothing extraordinary. But the tirimisu on the other hand was so good. It was very thick and soft with some kind of powder on the top. It reminded me a lot of cheesecake. So overall it was a 5 star meal. I recommend you get whatever appetizer you like, margarita pizza and the tirimisu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and open quite late which came in handy as we were staying closeby and only decided to go out at 10pm. We enjoyed the Italian food, wine menu and the servers were quick, helpful and friendly. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"2.5/5* Food - food was not what was expected from a welcoming ambiance. Came with a group of 16 for a birthday in the private room. Seafood linguini ... Just puréed tomato sauce with seafood (mussels without the mussels, just shells). Ravioli.... More like ricotta cheese wontons.. Did not taste the brown butter.. Not flavorful. Calamari... Salty.. Arancini was the best (stuffed risotto balls)    Service - 1* server only gave one napkin to the one person who asked for it (came in with a pile of napkins but gave it to one person...) Server asked if we need them to cut the cake and I said we can cut the cake so that the cutting fee doesn't apply (waiter told us that there would be no cutting fee if we cut it ourselves) waiter then came back and told us that he made a mistake and that there will be a cutting fee (only charged us for half the people)-- should have been taken off because it was his fault.   Ambience - should have labeled the private dining not room for what it was because people kept walking into our room thinking it was a washroom."}
{"text":"Came by after a visit to the aquarium.  Lamb chops really good. Great ambiance and decor.  Large place and lively."}
{"text":"Ok so let me start by saying when I travel and visit new areas, which is quite often, I ALWAYS choose where to eat on YELP.   I have a selection criteria that my fiancé and I decided worked for us (AND NEVER BEEN LEAD WRONG) When we search, the establishment has to have at least 100 reviews and be rated at least a four star. So based on that alone, I would never have come to the Taverna Mercado.  So why did I??  Because my fiancé had eaten here on a couple of other occasions when on business in Toronto, and frankly raved about the pizza. So we gave it a go.  I ordered the pizza (not called pepperoni but was essentially that) which my fiancé recommended.  Simply amazing - 5 star. The service - 5 star. The experience overall - 5 star. So then I have to go back and look at all the other reviews to try to understand why did this place only have a 3 1/2 star rating! I am going to be honest and say - please help me understand why anyone would low rate an establishment based on price??? First of all I didn't think this was grossly expensive $19 for a pizza, all in 30 bucks, but you can easily find out the cost of a restaurant and if it's out of your price range don't go there. But I look at several reviews that say the food was quite good but it was expensive. Hmmmm Does not seem fair. Others say it's the go to place before or after games because it's just near the stadiums. They talk about how packed it was and then say service was slow so low rate it. Hmmmmm Slow service is not unusual when a place is packed and standing room only. I just think it would be more fair to consider rating your experience by the food quality, taste and overall service. Only my opinion, but if I could add more stars to this review I would  so I could offset those who low rated them for what I think are simply unjust reasons."}
{"text":"Another overpriced downtown Italian restaurant. However, I really like their Tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Venue- 5/5. Beautiful, classy interior and big sidewalk patio plus superb Italian food = a pretty solid night. Located in a touristy area between the ACC and Rogers Centre, TM is perfect for dates, family or friends gatherings, or touristy night out.  Food- 4/5. There's not many vegetarian options unfortunately. Pescatarians can rejoice though - the platters feature many seafood options. I ordered the albacore tuna, which came on a bed of greens and green beans and boiled potatoes. The tuna steaks were fatty and well cooked, but smelled and tasted a bit too fishy imo. My partner ordered the margherita pizza, the only vegetarian pizza option unless you consider the salsiccia, which can become vegetarian by replacing the sausages with veggies. The crust was very thin and the dough was quite tasty. Reminded me of a via mercanti pizza. However, the cheese was so-so. Our favorite dish was the arancini appetizer - 3 fried risotto balls coating chewy provolone cheese on a bed of tomato sauce. Strongly recommend this dish - unhealthy, puts you into a food coma, but soooo delicious.  Value- 3/5. Pricy, but reasonable for date night. Pizzas and pastas are $15-20 while protein platters hover $20-40. Tonight for two without drinks we spent $60. No complimentary bread here (though we never asked), so load up on orders!  Service- 4/5. We had a wonderful waitress. All the staff in fact were young, poised, and chill/friendly. Have to subtract 1 star for the speed and attentiveness - appetizer came after the mains since was forgotten and everything took a while to happen, from waters to orders to food arriving to billing."}
{"text":"I was fairly disappointed with Taverna.  It was nearly empty when I came in for dinner and to watch the Raptors game, so we took a little time to ask our server a few questions about the menu. We were intrigued by the dall'acqua (seafood platter) which was described as \"king crab legs, wild shrimp, albacore tuna crudo, moroccan octopus & bay of fundy scallop salad, house hot sauce\". We asked about the portion size, and we were told that it was a very big portion, with 4-5 king crab legs and a bunch of everything else. He said that to feed 2, all we would need was the platter and a pasta. King crab legs are expensive, so at $45, we thought this was a steal.  We ended up ordering the dall'acqua (seafood platter) and chitarrine e vongole (squid ink pasta with clams). I noted that we placed our order around tipoff time (7:30pm).  The first quarter was nearly finished when our seafood platter arrived at 8pm. We were disappointed with the portion size. The platter was large alright, but it was at least 80% ice. On that ice lay 5 shrimp, a small bowl with 4 pieces of tuna crudo, a similarly small bowl of scallop/octopus salad, and one crab leg/claw. The portion size was not \"large by any means\".  The food was decent, however. The albacore tuna was really good - seasoned perfectly. The salad had a few tiny pieces of scallops/octopus mixed into a green apple salad. I enjoyed the scallop pieces but the octopus was quite tough. The shrimp was pretty meh - sizable but tasted pretty generic. The king crab leg/claw was very tasty, but there was just so little. We also weren't given a crab cracker.  So we finished our seafood platter and waited for our pasta. We didnt receive our pasta until after halftime (9pm). Prior to the pasta finally being brought to our table, different servers would come by us, see our empty table, and ask us if we'd like to order any more food. Each time, we told them we were still waiting for a pasta ordered a while ago. A 90 minute wait at a restaurant is unacceptable, especially without any reasonable explanation. Luckily, we were there to watch a game so we weren't in any rush, but I was very disappointed with this.  The pasta itself was good, though, I'm a fan of the food, just not the value for money or the service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so beautiful and vibrant.  I love everything about the decor.  The service was really fast, perhaps too fast, but we happened to visit on a game night, so I think a lot of diners were rushing in and out to go to the game.  The food.  The arincini was probably the best I've had in a while.  It was so good, we ordered another plate of balls!  Unfortunately, my entree was not as impressive.  I ordered the sweet potato gnocci with short rib, spinach and ricotta salata.  It was A-OK, definitely not mind-blowing.    Despite this, I probably will make a point to return.  It's pretty good italian food for the price point and I would be open to trying other menu items (and eating more of the arincini!)."}
{"text":"I had the spiedini(grilled octopus) / arancini(fried risotto balls) / spaghetti e bufala / chitarrine e vongole and it was amazing! Everything was seasoned perfectly and nothing was too heavy nor overpowering. Overall, a wonderful Italian dinner I enjoyed with my mom who is a tough critic to please! Probably one of the best Italian food I've had in the city. The staff was also lovely and the decor was very pleasing and inviting. The warm edison lightbulb fixtures made the spacious venue feel cozy and comfortable. I'd definitely come back to try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Thia place is awesome. Everything i had was incredible but especially the lasagna special. I'm a born and bread NY Italian and have had some of the best lasagna growing up...this one tops it! Shhh, don't tell my Mom. Also, that pork chop they have was perfection too. Yeah...i probably ate too much but I couldn't help myself. Beautiful restaurant with really nice service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this new place.  I've always enjoyed their food. We use to have to walk to the Eaton Centre and I'm SO happy that they've opened one by my home! Tonight I had a good ol bowl of spaghetti with veal and pork meatballs. THE BEST outside of Italy. The grilled calamari was also delicious and well, the teramisu- I wish I could lick the bowl. Lol .   I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Catching up with my friend over lunch today. This place was packed even on a Monday, speaks for itself how popular this place is.   The quality of food prevails - i ordered a Linguini di mare and my friend ordered a pizza. We always knew the quality of food is high but when it comes to accommodating client's dietary restrictions, they are not as flexible.  The lactose free options were quite limited and not left with many alternatives. My pasta was a bit disappointing- how could a seafood linguini not come with shrimps but only with small pieces of scallops, mussels and calamari? The pasta was al dente but the ingredients could be more robust.   Their desserts are always to die for- the caramel icecream cup was to die for and so was their tiramisu! If i were to choose, i would jump right into desserts if possible!   All in all a great place to catch up with friends!!   Have fun and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located near my office in Toronto and it is one of the places we like to go as a team.... the food is very good, the ambiance is perfect - whether you are going as a couple or as a small group and the location cannot be beaten.  The group had meat and pasta - and all loved their dish.  I once had the beef and once had the chicken and both were really good. The chicken had a little twist giving it a bit of a different personality.  This is definitely my go-to place with colleagues or even by myself when traveling."}
{"text":"I have only been here for Brunch but it is now my favourite brunch place in Toronto. Their patio and decor is rustic and  beautiful! We ordered the Carbonara and Pizza. The pizza had sunny side up egg on it and it was delicious.  Their Caesars are also very tasty. Service was great. Looking forward to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner. Staff very friendly and foods great.   Our group had: Lamb shank Meatballs Calamari  Beet salad  All very good.   Have a decent Barolo by the glass so I'm happy happy!"}
{"text":"Went for a pre-Raptors game meal. As this was a Friday, the place was busy but we had easily been able to make an appointment the night before via the website.  We were seated promptly. We liked the decor of the place. Most people there were either doing the same as us, or were having a group meal after work.  I would say the waiter had patience with us, as most of my group were more interested in Pizza Pizza style food.  We got the calamari and arancini appetizers and happy with both.  We got very basic pizzas and enjoyed them both.  I got a Tagliatelli pasta with duck ragu - flavors were ok, but I found the duck a bit tough.  Overall the bill for four of us, with appetizers, but without alcoholic drinks or desserts, totalled $100 which was reasonable.    Overall a good choice for a pre- or post-ACC meal. Would return."}
{"text":"Popped in a few minutes before noon and we were seated quickly. The place filled up really fast.   We ordered the squid ink pasta and carbonara and both were great! The carbonara comes with an over easy yolk to stir into the past. It is a rich dish, so go easy on the apps!!   Service was great!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and the pizza margherita was fantastic!  The Taverna Burger was very bland tasting and not sufficient/proper condiments that you would expect on a burger; my bad for getting a burger; The 'Bacon Side' consituted of 3 pieces of yet again bland bacon that was grilled and had a charred taste;"}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant for business lunch when I'm in the area. I've not been disappointed with any items on the menu. My favourite has to be the spicy chicken, not spicy enough for me but they have a great chilli sauce you can ask for. The Arctic char is always cooked to perfection and quite tasty. And all the appetizer are amazing, the best has to be the grilled octopus, so tender with right amount of char and good combination with the fregola. The pistachio cannoli for dessert is so good, very light and just the right amount of sweetness.   There's another Mercatto in the Eaton Centre with the same menu, but it's never quite as good. In fact falls below mediocre. The spicy chicken was a bit dry and pastas were bland. So don't go to that one."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Excellent cuisine (try the linguini Di Mare).   If you're at the ACC or the SkyDome (I will never call it Rogers Centre), this is a great pre or post stop."}
{"text":"Great service here. They know their wines. Had a variety of things such as pizza and pasta. Loved the burratta beet salad."}
{"text":"Decent food but nothing to write home about. The lamb sausage was disgusting. The atmosphere and service were good. Not a high quality Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Taverna Mercatto is conveniently located near the Delta Toronto hotel in the Entertainment District of Downtown Toronto.   For drinks, we shared two Moosehead Radler on draught. This is the first time I've heard of blending beer with grapefruit juice. I liked how it was sweet, light, refreshing and surprisingly not sour or tart. I sampled the Blackthorn Cider but felt it was too dry and strong for me.  For lunch, we ordered a variety - Spiedini (appetizer), Pesce (fish entree), Chitarrine E Vongole (pasta), and Margherita Pizza (pizza). All the dishes were delicious in their own way.  My mom ordered the Spiedini, which consisted of grilled octopus on top of fregola (pasta resembling Israeli couscous), panna fresca (Italian cream), tomato, and olive tapenade.   My dad ordered the Margherita Pizza, which consisted of buffalo mozzarella, sprigs of basil, and San Marzano tomato sauce. We liked how it wasn't too cheesy.   My brother ordered the Chitarrine E Vongole, which consisted of fresh squid ink pasta, topped with savory clams, guanciale (cured meat), and bone marrow pangratatto, and garnished with sliced chili peppers. We liked garlicky and savory aroma and taste of the dish.  I ordered the Pesce, which consisted of Arctic Char served over roasted vegetables (e.g., cauliflower, fingerlings, escarole) and chopped almonds in a lemon vinaigrette. The fish was tender, skin was crispy, and the vegetables were cooked to perfection and quite flavorful.  It was probably my favorite meal from this Toronto trip."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend last night. My friend noticed a long hair in his pasta. Our server took care of it and brought a new dish 10 minutes later. We were charged for the pasta - which is fine - but I'm surprised that they didn't do anything other than replace the dish. Other than that the food and service were good."}
{"text":"Leaving this restaurant. Spent 300 for poor service and food that was bland. Enjoy service somewhere else! I shouldn't have to ask for more water let alone anything else."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out because we saw the pretty decor from the outside.  DRINKS:  Beer - Peroni  Appetizer: SALUMI (3/5) (local and imported artisanal meats) The jamon was delish!  The pretzels that came with it were a great mix with this charcuterie board.  Mains: CHITARRINE E VONGOLE (3/5) (fresh squid ink pasta, savoury clams, guanciale, bone marrow pangratatto) The clams & squid ink pasta were good. I liked this pasta compared to the tortiglioni that I've ordered. This pasta gears towards the lighter end of taste buds.  TORTIGLIONI (2/5) (butchers ragu, lamb neck, wild boar, provimi veal) There wasn't enough sauce and they added too much salt onto the pasta. But! The meats within the pasta were pretty good."}
{"text":"my wife and I tried this place a few days ago, and overall we were both happy. Its a typical italian restaurant so I wont bore you with the selection of food, but we had pasta and a panini for dinner, both tasted fresh. For dessert we shared one canoli, i would recommend two.  Wine list was a little short but they will have something you will like.  Service was good and there is lots of space to move around.  Highly recommend coming here. The only reason it is not a 5 is because there are better Italian restaurants in Toronto, but this is a good option."}
{"text":"Average italian place, but a decent option in the area. I prefer the other mercatto locations more. The pasta didn't taste freshly made, but the seafood was good, especially the clams and octopus. I may come back if looking for something in the area."}
{"text":"I loved the meat balls and the sea fruit appetizer. nice place to have good conversation, romantic dinner, or even a birthday gathering."}
{"text":"I work at the adjoining building and this is one of the best places for business lunch around the office. This place is pretty crowded in the afternoon and you should make a reservation. They have some good wines. For food,  my favourite there is the Salmon Salad with the Avocado. I simply love it. The staff is efficient and waste no time to get what you want. After lunch coffee has some great options. Compared to the nearby places out there (like Eleven), this is perhaps the best pick for a business lunch where you can get a great ambience, a classy environment and good service. If you are here for drinks on a night where there is a game or concert at the ACC, be prepared to find a crowded restaurant- the wait time can be up to 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Horrible service and very mediocre food. Great job on the design though. Waitress threw the receipt on our table, no eye contact. Salad was over dressed in blue cheese. They did regularly fill our water though."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The restaurant itself was really nice, staff service was excellent, food was great! Definitely need to try the calamari! It is so good.   I had the linguine and it was so delicious! The sauce was just perfect. If you are into seafood on your pasta, definitely try this dish out!"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, perfect September outdoor lunch seating. Erin was amiable and quick to make recommendations when we asked. She was engaging and nearby when we needed something but didn't hover. Her recommendations were spot-on. We split the misticanza salad, arancini, and diavola pizza and I would come back for all three again. The salad was just a salad, I know, but the sherry vinaigrette was flawless in its flavor and application - perfectly tossed and completely coated without pooling. The arancini are mid-sized and the three are a great shareable - crispy shell with gooey provolone center held together nicely by the risotto. Really pleased we stumbled on this place on our way from CN Tower to ACC between events."}
{"text":"Went for after dinner drinks. Place was quiet for a Friday night. Asked the hostess for a bar top table and when I asked for another location, the hostess just rolled her eyes like she was annoyed that I had to make her walk 10 more steps. It wasn't even busy! I hate it when hostesses give attitude when I was asking politely for a different table. Starts the whole evening off by the first person who greeted me. Like smile for goodness. If you hate your job, get one that makes you smile!   Good thing my server was friendly, patient and personable.  Drinks were interestingly different and decent price points. Would go back again but hope I don't get that moody hostess."}
{"text":"Five stars for sure! I've been here a handful of times and I'll continue to go back as their food is consistent - always delicious. I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but what I have tried and would recommend is the: Calamari, Pizza (Margherita is my fave), Meatballs (omg!) and last but certainly not least...the Tiramisu which is just the right portion. The staff is nice also. :)"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical walking into Taverna Mercatto, since they've basically become a chain (ie I was expecting a classier East Side Marios). But I was ultimately quite pleasantly surprised by an above-average Italian meal.  We started with the Arancini (chive, risotto, provolone, spicy tomato sauce). It arrived to the table hot and fresh, and was quite delicious. The inside of the ball was gooey and cheesy, while the sauce provided for the exterior was a perfect complement.  I ordered the Spaghetti e Bufala (tomato sugo, mozzarella di bufala, basil, padano). This was a simple yet effective tomato-sauce-based pasta dish. I really enjoyed the little pockets of mozzarella that kept popping up through the dish. I suppose my one complain was that it might've been a little *too* simple (ie it could've used more spices to give it just a little more flavor).  The service was slow but attentive."}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Service: 5 Value: 1 Presentation: 5 Overall: 3.9 rounded up to 4  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. For starters we are trying out the fried calamari and meatballs. The main will be a veal parmesan with a side salad. Let's dive right into the review.  The fried calamari wasn't a big plate but boy did it look good. Fried calamari is one of my favourite starters and this dish strengthened my claim. The meatballs were very tender on the inside but I would've prefered if the outer layer was slightly crispier. The veal parmesan looked sooooo good. The cheese was very stringy, but it kind of fell apart when I was cutting the meat. The side salad was surprisingly very impressive, arguably better than the parmesan (veggies over meat what am I thinking)!  Italian food is generally on the more expensive side, and the costs on these menus were ferocious. I generally wouldn't come here too often unless somebody was willing to subsidize my meal ;)  The service was fantastic. The waitress came by frequently to pour us water and check on how our meals were doing. Couldn't expect any less.  In conclusion I enjoyed this meal and thought that it was very delicious. I would define this place to be one of the better food places around Union and am excited to try their pizza next time. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember that food is life!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: excellent location (probably a good idea to make a reservation), decent food, unique ambience, and excellent service.  You're probably not going to end up here if you're searching for the most authentic Italian cuisine. But the food by most standards is still pretty good. I had the pizza and it was delicious, although expectedly not quite at the same level as some specialty pizzerias. A few of my companions had the pasta dishes and they were all pleased with their selections.  The decor is interesting, bearing a bit of a steampunk-ish kind of feel. I was seated inside one of their rooms, which kind of felt like a church with stained glass and all. Our server was pleasant and checked our water glasses regularly.  While I wouldn't recommend it as a place that you'd travel from far and wide to come and check out, it's nonetheless a pretty reliable option if you're going to be in the area and are feeling for some Italian food. Because of its proximity to the financial district and sports district, you'll probably want to make a reservation during peak hours if you want to be seated quickly."}
{"text":"It's only ok.  Came here with a friend for lunch.  Service was great but my lunch was meh.  We got a warm greeting at the door and were promptly seated just before noon.  It was quite empty then but the restaurant fills up quickly.  I ordered the seafood linguine and she ordered the margherita pizza (we didn't share so no comment on the pizza).  For the price, I thought the pasta was a bit on the small side (though admittedly I was hungry), though there was a decent amount of seafood in the dish.  More importantly though, while it tasted just fine, the flavours just didn't pull together like I expect a restaurant quality pasta to.  It was only marginally better than if I poured a jar of (high quality) store bought sauce over (high quality) pasta made at home.  I also ordered a coke which tasted kinda flat and a bit too sweet, which some people may prefer (I like my pop bubbly).  Refills are free though and was enthusiastically offered by our server before our glasses got empty.  Overall, I have to admit that though the ambiance and decor was great, I was disappointed with the food, especially since I'm a fan of Mercatto and have enjoyed my meals at the Bay Street, Toronto Street, and Eaton Centre locations.  I work downtown though so I'll likely end up back to give Taverna Mercatto another try.  However, at this point if I wanted Italian food in the financial district, I would still choose the other Mercatto locations and Terroni on Adelaide, or Aria and Modus on the higher end, over this one."}
{"text":"I have visited Taverna Mercatto in the past and have to say the food has taken a turn for the worse. We had a few appetizers at the bar including the steak skewers, calamari and bruschetta and I have to say each dish was underwhelming. Perhaps appetizers is not a way to go here.  They have one of the large bar areas downtown and service at the bar is generally quick. It's proximity to the Rogers Dome makes it ideal for drinks prior to a game. As for the main course meals, I have eaten here before and thought the portions were nicely sized and the quality of the food was good. However, not that \"memorable\"."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly great! After reading reviews and contemplating if we should come here before a concert we decided it was too close to the stadium not to give it a try. The wait was about an hour. We ordered the Calamari and meatballs for appetizers. Calamari was delicious and so were the meatballs. It was a great portion for 2. We decided to share the plate of ravioli. The plate was smaller than we thought. It was four raviolis for $22 (I believe). Kind of steep for four raviolis....it was tasty though. Great ambience and great location!"}
{"text":"Drinks were a bit weak but the food was delicious, especially the lamb. Great outdoor seating area and warm even on the chill nights. The service as good as well."}
{"text":"My guy and I came here after a show at the ACC. We we're looking for an interesting place to eat while in Toronto and this one hit all of the right spots for us! We were excited to see the variety of authentic Italian fare and wine which we greatly enjoy.   The food arrived and it was nothing short of absolutely stellar. We started with the Spiedini, Carpaccio Di Manzo and Frutti Di Mare. We enjoyed the amazing appetizers so much, I actually ordered a second Spiedini! Lol the octopus was grilled perfectly while still tender and flavourful.   After savouring every bite, we decided to actually get some entrées. My guy ordered the Chitarrine E Vongole (Squid Ink Pasta with clams) and I had the Striploin steak. Both meals were absolutely delicious. My steak was grilled to absolute perfection and his pasta was nicely done, the clams were a lovely touch. The food was incredibly fresh.   The second thing I have to point out about our experience is the phenomenal efforts put forward from our server, Zoey. He suggested appropriate wine pairings for every dish that we enjoyed. His attention to detail and extensive knowledge on Italian wine really made our dining adventure outstanding. He thoroughly explained everything and answered all of our questions. If you're lucky enough to have him as your server, you will be in for a treat! Thanks Zoey! :)  Overall, it's one of the nicest dining experiences we've ever had in Toronto and we will be sure to return there once again when we are in town!   5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I've had better Italian food.  The diavola pizza was better than my dish.  The vongole with clams had too much sand every bite.  It lacked flavor.  Also they asked us if we had reservations but looking inside almost every table except for one or two tables was free.  Really? Also no bread offered which I thought they would do. The portions for lunch were a bit small for the prices."}
{"text":"This is one of my best Italian foods experiences in Toronto. I'm always late for my dinner, so I found my delicious Ravioli here at 11 p.m."}
{"text":"We ordered the meat/cheese board, carbonara pasta, and pancetta pizza. All very delicious with great presentation."}
{"text":"Had Arancini as an app which was Very delicious. For entrees we had Pollo Alla Diavola (Spicy Chicken) and Orecchiette Di Pugliese (Sausage Pasta). The pasta was a bit dry but was still fairly good probably just needed a bit more sauce. The Spicy chicken was cooked perfectly and the sides where very good and fresh. Can't remember the wine name but the waiter recommended a great wine as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and quick bite after a Leaf game. Try the salciccia pizza! You won't be disappointed. Awesome sauce, best crust ever. Melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"This place was much better than I expected. When I go south of King St. I expect generic corporate blandness but we had a really good meal here. The menu had lots of Italian choices snd my calamari and ravioli dishes were delicious. Wine list is well thought out and we were very pleased. Lots of beer choices! Yes, they get it. Comfy room, cheerful service (yes, we were in Toronto) and overall a good    Relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"I am guilty of going to this restaurant way too often. This is my go-to restaurant whenever I am too lazy to walk far for a meal.   I keep coming back though, especially to sit at the patio to people-watch and soak some vitamin D from the balmy summer weather.   The decor of the restaurant makes where to sit a tough choice. The interior is absolutely lovely: gleaming counters, low set ceiling lamps, open bar coupled with an industrial-looking ceiling. It's chic, trendy and upbeat. Despite the gorgeous interior, I always opt for the patio.  Highly recommend their Chitarrine E Vongole, with fresh squid ink pasta, savoury clams, guanciale, bone marrow pangratatto. Seasoned perfectly, the squid ink is very well infused into the pasta. I would also recommend the Insalata Di Salmone with chilled salmon, romaine, cucumber, avocado, farro, orange vinaigrette. Salmon is fresh and the vinaigrette dressing is very refined.  I am not a fan of their brunch menu to be honest. I find the selection to be very limited. The pasta is a meagre selection of Spaghetti E Bufala, Chitarra alla Carbonara and Orechitte di Pugliese. The Margherita pizza was mediocre. I was not impressed at all.   Props also to the very Gatsbyesque postcard they give you when you pay the bill."}
{"text":"Pretty good! We went for brunch. I got the egg sandwich. Everything was very good, but not amazing. I would go here again."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I will be back again. The pizza here is excellent. They use very few ingredients but what they use is very high quality. The sauce is made from fresh San Marzano tomatoes which absolutely make this pizza. Reminds me of the pizza we had in Italy. I had the Diavola pizza...a bit of spice but not too much. The Burrata with beets and arugula was very good, but it was not burrata, just very good fresh mozzarella. Burrata should be filled with cream and curds. The wine list has some very good choices. We had the Barbera. Perfect wine with what we had to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered Calamari and Tonno.  Calamari was excellent. flavourful and was not too chewy or rubbery.  The tuna had a tomato sauceish base, topped with the arugula, potato, and green bean. and on top of that had the albacore tuna. lots of strong flavours here. tuna was seared to perfection. my one dissatisfaction was that it was a bit too salty."}
{"text":"Taverna Mercatto has a few chains. One used to be on Bay and Adelaide but it's closed down. Also there's a location inside the Eaton Centre. I've always enjoyed the food at all the locations so I was very excited to learn that the new location was located in the building next to my work! I frequently have lunch here. The ambience is nice and modern with a nice covered patio in the summer. There always plenty of room in the bar area if you don't make reservations. Also it's conveniently located right across from the ACC. Great place to go for a pre-game meal. On Thursdays they have their lasagna special for lunch only and it's amazing. If you get there late they will sell out since they only make one batch that day. It's a must try. The pastas are all fresh pastas. My favourites are spicy sausage with orecchiette pasta with rapini and olive oil base dish. Also the seafood linguini is delicious. The carbonara pasta is also amazing and their pizza are to die for. They start you off with their fresh bread and you have to ask for their fresh chilli soaked in chilli oil. If you like it they also sell it by the jar in-house for around $15.  My favourite dessert that I always get there is their tiramisu! It's small so it's a nice finishing touch."}
{"text":"This was right in the same building as our office so it was convenient. A bit pricy but the setting is comfortable. Staffs are friendly and attentive. Food was good but didn't wow me that much. Your call."}
{"text":"Outstanding place for dinner. Excellent service. Creative menu. Italian with New American flare. Top notch. Great spot for work dinner or cocktails"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed recently to learn that my favourite dish here is no longer on the menu. It was a squid ink pasta with clams which was delicious and worthy of 5 stars on its own! It has been replaced with a shrimp bucatini with pistachio pesto which was alright. I also really like one of their desserts - the Caramel Copetta which is a salted caramel gelato sundae with peanuts and marshmallow."}
{"text":"Vibrant scene with a mix of suits downtown and casual eaters heading to the game. We had the burrata beet salad and the burrata was really generous. I had the parpadelle (awesome) and a glass of moscato for a nice balance. Great food and attentive servers!"}
{"text":"The food was okay- wasn't particularly good but not bad either, but for its price you're paying for, the portions are very small.  Pastas cost between 15 - 20 dollars but getting two small burgers from McDonalds would be more filling.  I have a very tiny girlfriend and yet she was still hungry after the meal (we got appetizers as well). Can you imagine how hungry I was after this??!"}
{"text":"Since Taverna Mercatto is near my building, I have always wanted to try it since I have a deep love for pasta. However, every time I ask about the wait times, it's always at least an hour. I finally gave in and went on a Friday night around 5:30pm and got on the wait list. They gave us an estimated 45 minute wait time and were right on the ball about that; we were promptly seated 6:30pm.   The ambiance was cozy but lively. The interior was beautiful and classy and it paved the way for a nice evening out. It's a short walk to the ACC and one block away from the CN tower which made it very convenient.   My party and I ordered the calamari starter, the salsiccia pizza, the bucatini gamberetti, and the polla alla diavola. The calamari was a good sized plate and the caper cream dipping was delicious. I loved the shrimp that came with the bucatini and the pasta was made just to my liking - on the harder side but very tasty. I especially loved the pesto sauce in this dish. The pizza was okay; the dough was very thin but was a good add on to go with the rest of the dishes. As for the spicy chicken, it was cooked well - not dry at all. Overall, I was very satisfied with the plates that we ordered and was very pleasantly surprised. Prices were reasonable and were at about 20-30$ a plate. Service was great and we always had what we needed.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would say that I'd come back for another meal. The only slight deterrent is the wait time but given how I had a great time here, it seems that everyone else does too so it's no surprise that wait times are long. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Just went for a light diner with my wife and I must say we have been disappointed. The food was just ok. Service was not at level. While the restaurant was fairly empty the servers were mostly busy preparing tables and cleaning instead of carrying for service."}
{"text":"I work fairly close to this restaurant so I dined here twice recently. My first visit was for a coworker's birthday so we had a large group. The restaurant was very accommodating and obliged our request that we needed to be out in an hour. They also provided a complimentary slice of cake for the birthday boy, which was much appreciated. During my second visit for a dinner, service was less attentive. One thing that bugged me was that I had to ask for bread, or else they wouldn't give you any.  Small issues aside, the food was great- especially the pasta! I tried the chitarra alla carbonara and the pappardelle with braised duck. The carbonara was creamy, rich, and delicious, albeit a tad salty. It's a good one to share. The pappardelle was also very tasty and hearty. However, the standout dish for me was their lasagna, which sadly was a daily special. My coworker ordered it and let me try a few bites. I loved the savoury browned crust on the top layer and I would order it in a heartbeat if it was available again. All my other coworkers also seemed to have enjoyed their dishes.   Small issues aside, I enjoyed dining at Taverna and will probably revisit in the future, given its proximity to my workplace!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We showed up about 30 minutes before the hockey game and got the last available table outside. It was kind of cold so the restaurant had some blankets available.   I ordered the fried risotto and the albacore tuna. It was so good. I wish the fish was seasoned a little more but everything under the fish added more flavor. Pretty good but could still refine flavors a little."}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere. Get the Arancini if you're looking for a starter. They are very delicious. We ordered a pizza with prosciutto and onions followed by a pasta with fresh sausage and arugula which was amazing. The waitress said they are known for that dish and I can't remember the name of it. Service is great. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for my friend's birthday. It was a short walk from The Rec Room and the tables were all ready when we inquired at the host stand. We had the back section near the open kitchen; split between the booths and high tops.   The reviews recommended the carbonara and the photos that I saw confirmed my decision. The waitress was pretty attentive for the group of our size. There were around 30 guests in the group. The dish was as delicious as I thought it would be. It was confirmed that the other dishes I saw around me were equally as good.   The one thing that wasn't as pleasant was the cake cutting fee. I understand we didn't order dessert from the restaurant and the restaurant may impose a fee for storing, cutting and distributing cake from another establishment. What I didn't appreciate was that each bill was charged $2 for cake cutting. To me that seemed a bit excessive as I'm sure there were more than 15 bills that night."}
