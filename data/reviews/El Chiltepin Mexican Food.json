{"text":"I have been to El Chiltepin about 4 or 5 times now and every time, I am just impressed with the quality of their food. I consider myself well versed in South Phoenix Mexican restaurants and this little dive is easily top three in terms of taste and quality. Don't let the exterior fool you, this is a hidden gem in South Phoenix. 

So what sets it apart? First of all, the salsa, both red and green, are perfect. They have a subtlety of flavor that is absent from the salsas of other Mexican joints. The have the right spice level and both have a unique taste. I can't tell which is better, but they are different and add interesting complexity to the food. 

Second, the food is well made with quality ingredients. I have had tortas from most of the restaurants in the area and they are not as tasty as here. The bread is quality as well as the meat used for the carne asada. The cheese is quality Mexican queso and it has a rich creamy flavor that is missing when I go to other joints. Finally, the quesadilla montada de carne asada may be one of the best quesadillas I have had. If you go, check out this item. It is fantastic.  

Finally, I like the portion size. Definitely enough to fill you up, but they don't overdo it like so many other places do. Quality of taste and ingredients is the first priority here, not quantity. I guess some people want a burrito the size of an infant, but I appreciate a restaurant that can give you enough without making it feel like you are in a speed eating contest.  

I know I am waxing poetic here, but I promise if you go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I work next door and make sure to come here atleast once a week.  By far the best mexican food in the area.  Everything they make is incredibly fresh.  I love their pork and their Carne."}
{"text":"We had the quesadilla montada, and the al pastor and green chili empanadas.

If you like meat lovers pizza, then you might like the montada.  But after 3 bites we found it too cheese and greasy meat heavy.  It's mozzarella, bacon, and carne asada.

The meat in the green chili empanada was terrible.  It was like some kind of really cheap ground beef.  I could't eat more than 1/3 of  it.  

The only highlights were the al pastor empanada and the horchata.  The al pastor was delicious with a hint of pineapple.  I would glady get this again - although there was not a lot of meat there.  The horchata was also very good with a distinct cinnamon flavor.

We really wanted to like the food after reading the New Times review but alas....."}
{"text":"I go to this part of town sometimes to visit.  We've gone several times to Chiltepin, as there's this dish called blondie or 'guera', I believe, that my sister's rave about (the name may not be advertised that way).  I tried it and it was damn tasty - loaded with lots of veggies (pico-style) and other mexican-style ingredients (meats, beans, etc).  They are good with portion sizes as I bought a burrito here that was ginormous... and the beans were yummy.

The owners are a Latin (don't know their exact background) husband and wife couple and I'm pretty sure they do all the work themselves (ie. prep, cook, serve, clean, etc) as I've never seen anyone else there.  They are very friendly and I think that friendliness/neighborliness and their food quality is the main reason my family and I still go here.  They seem to be improving from the first few months when we had tried them and their service was sssslloooow.. they are much quicker now (experience, I think) and their quality is still good.  I think they now accept card, but I usually pay cash to small businesses...

I would suggest they keep their menu limited and not so vast.. especially for a new start-up, you want to make sure you can deliver what you say in a timely manner and not waste product.. if you have a surprlus of product because your menu is vast, you are wasting and not meeting your cycle time for customer service... 

Out of all the shady taco/burrito/tostada places on Central in SoPho, I choose this one to go to because of the owners and operators."}
{"text":"heard about this place from my bro. the cooks and the ladies that work here are SOOOO stinkin' nice!

the carne asada and lengua are muy deliciosa! tacos are about 99c-1.10! quesadillas are about $4-6. the quesadilla montada is a quesadilla topped with refried beans, carne asada, cheese, bacon, and jalapenos! yummmmmmm.  the quesadilla con camarones is AMAZING and comes with guacamole and sour cream.

the burritos are about $4-7 (seafood goes up to about $9), and so tasty. personally, i hate beans/rice/potatoes in my burritos, so i recommend the burritos with just meat and cheese. 

haven't had one single thing that i didn't like here. super fresh, authentic, and NON-GREASY!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay i intern next door and showed up real early to my meeting and was hungry so i decided to walk on over there and grab a bite.

WOW so worth it! the owners are sooo friendly and were talking to me about how everything is made fresh and \"all natural, no msg\". They also gave me horchata \"rice water\" which was a homemade recipe and amazingly delicious. I hate horchata normally but this one i could drink all day! 

To be honest i am glad i stopped and finally found phoenix's good and authentic mexican food. (it isn't good if it isn't authentic).

oh yeah, i got the breakfast burro cause i was itching for some eggs this morning...i am pretty sure i found the place i want to try menudo at..

I am going to be back... A LOT"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with my sisters after a hike up South Mountain.  

We tried the carne asada tacos, which had a good grill flavor.  We ate in, not sure if it's different if it's to go, but we got two little trays of salsa-red and green which were both very good.  We both had horchata which I liked but my sis didn't.  I thought it was real because it was grainy like just made, but she thought it was a powdered mix and milky..anyhoo....

I had a side of beans which I thought were really good but my sister was pretty sure they were canned.  I don't believe her and I don't think she believed herself because she also ended up getting a bean and cheese burrito after she was done with her tacos and loved it!

Along with my tacos, I tried their green chile empanada, which was cheesy and really good but also really big!  I tried to eat it all.....The prices were decent for the food.

We were satisfied with our experience and would like to try some of their other items on a future occassion.

Staff was really friendly, and it's covered outside seating"}
{"text":"Great food.  my absolute favorite is the quesadilla con camarones!  

i ended up going here 3 times in one week after the first time i tried it.. and the cashier remembered me after the first time i came and remembered my order!

tried some tacos and burritos... all of them were great!"}
