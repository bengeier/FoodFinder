{"text":"Oh man....there is a reason Dave is famous for BBQ--try the babyback ribs here."}
{"text":"We had never been and some out of town family suggested it! What the heck?  Why had we never tried it before? We tried the large sampler platter.. everything was beyond delish!  That chicken tho!  Unbelievably delish.. been thinking of it ever since! Service was fantastic too! Will be back! Thank you for surprising us!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout for our outing. We had both chicken and pork. There was plenty of flavor on the meats . We also ordered their beans and macaroni and cheese . Lover their corn bread . There was plenty of food to go aroud"}
{"text":"I am not a big barbeque  fan . However  this restaurant  has an extremely  good potato  soup with bacon and cheese it is like a  full meal . Gotta try their macaroni  and cheese"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today & it was delicious! Was too hungry to get a picture that's how good it was! I definitely recommend the BBQ brisket Sandwich with the side of mashed potatoes, also got the mac & cheese (has jalape√±os in it) but didn't really like that very much. The cornbread muffin was amazing! The ribs were good! Everything we had at our table today was tasty. The service was also delightful. The waitress was very polite, smiled a lot & brought my daughter a balloon to the table when we were paying. The hostesses were also very polite they opened the door for us on our way out, which I though added a little something extra to our visit. Will definitely come back when we're in town!"}
