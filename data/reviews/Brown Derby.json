{"text":"I was visiting my family in Ohio from my home in Arizona when we went to this restaurant. My father and I always enjoy getting drinks with our steaks when we go out to eat. It is a huge tradition to us. When I ordered my drink I was denied due to the fact my Arizona license expires in 2058. I spoke to the manager and he said my ID was \"un-legitimate\". I had multiple forms of ID with me as well as debit cards that had my name on them but he still said he couldn't allow me to drink. He even talked to the owner of the restaurant and they still denied me. The manager was rude and very disrespectful. We left due to the fact that I did not want to give them my business. 1 star*"}
{"text":"So far, not good. I ordered fried battered mushrooms, and there was raw flour in one. The wait for our server is a little long. Let's see if the rest of the meal goes better.  It's taking forever to get out salad and bread. Just got the mushrooms and they have cut them in half, and charging the same price! I'm used to the mushrooms being large. It just looks better visually. The baked potatoes were cold. Now we have to wait another 10 mins for our potatoes. And out meat is cold. They got our orders wrong. The wrong drink for my guest, her potato had sour cream and she didn't want it. This is just sad. I've lost my appetite. Won't be back....UGGHHHH!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this new \"throwback\" of a restaurant from the 80's. If you like average food at high prices, than this place is for you. Nachos, salad, and pulled pork sandwich were all just ok. 10 bucks for a glass of average wine. Inside looks ok but bare and nothing on the walls. Wish it was better but will stay with longhorn as my steak provider and with a couple extra bucks saved in my pocket."}
{"text":"Not the 'Derby I remember growing up.  A family outing to Brown Derby was a highlight of my childhood, and while I didn't expect a salad bar, I was a bit put off by the dressing being served in a plastic cup...and a small amount to top it off.  I had a Kansas City Strip which I figured was a smaller cut of NY Strip.  The meat was thinly sliced, looking not at all like strip, but prepared as I ordered it.  I opted for the french fries, hoping for plain old french fries or maybe even steak fries if I was lucky.  What I was served were the kind with the saline-binded spices sprayed on at the processing plant and the fake gold spray.  My mom wasn't impressed with her chicken salad either.  I'll drive the extra 5 miles to Outback next time."}
{"text":"I was treated to the Brown Derby to celebrate my birthday.  Everything was PHENOMENAL!  I would definitely come here again.  The steak was nice and juicy, potato was great and when I told them I didn't like brownies, they switched out my birthday dessert to something else.  THANK YOU FOR A GREAT MEAL!"}
{"text":"A really great place but not just for a special occasions. Food is plentiful and expertly prepared. Service is always attentive. And prices are competitive and reasonable."}
{"text":"We ignored bad reviews and chose this restaurant for dinner. Was dark inside of the dining area. We ordered porterhouse steaks medium well done. Got t-bone burnt on edges and near uncooked inside. Did not discover that until we got home and into the light. I called spoke to the manager and explained what happened. I asked for some type of adjustment. He 
denied my request . Will never go Back!!

{"text":"This place was kind of deceiving online was a lot nicer of a place than I expected. The salmon was great ! And so was the shrimp and steam . Even my daughters hog dog was good. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Found this classic old school steak joint on my travels. Love these kinds of places: chilled salad bowls, family style servings, steaks, seafood, prime rib and stiff drinks! Big portions for a decent price. Reminds me of places I use to go with my parents as a kid!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato and loaded baked potato were absolutely amazing and enormous - no restaurant makes them better.  I am giving this restaurant 2 stars, however, because I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the place.  The ladies restroom was NASTY. It smelled and was dirty! It was obvious that whoever is cleaning it does not know how to clean. I arrived at the restaurant at 4 pm - as soon as they opened, so there was NO EXCUSE. There was months and months of caked on dust and dirt all over everything in the bathroom. GROSS! The booth I sat in had a large tear in it and the large mirror on the wall was filthy. I do not feel that $20 for a meal should be in a dirty environment, so I will no be going back or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed dining at the Brown Derby. They have changed the atmosphere a little. Very nice decor. The food is great and one of my favorite places to dine. I had the salmon and it was very good but I had to give 4 stars because they took a little too long to serve  it."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided we would try the new place out since we were considering it for our daughters Graduation dinner with about 20 family and friends.  We were happy that when we arrived, the atmosphere was very nice and there was no wait for us to be seated.  The menu was nice and uncomplicated, which is nice to see in a time when places try and have so many pages it makes choices very hard.

We were promptly greeted by our server, a drink order and appetizer order was placed, but then we waited. Granted, this was a new place only opened for less than one full week, but the lady who was our server we recognized from other establishments in the Mentor area, so she is familiar with serving customers.  We never were brought any bread to our table and we thought it just wasn't offered, but when we left we did see just about every other table was given bread. 

Our appetizer (French Onion soup) was brought, and it was very good.  The price I thought was a bit high for the area, but it was very flavorful.  We placed our main course orders, and then about 10 minutes later someone came by to tell us that they were all out of baked potatoes.  Since we ordered steak, we didn't find anything else that we wanted with our steak, so basically all we received was a steak for our main course.  

A few minutes went by and the salads were brought out.  My wife ordered a tossed salad, and I had ordered the Blue Cheese Wedge salad.  The salads were very good, but it would be helpful if a butter knife were on the table for the salads.  I had to use the steak knife on the table for my wedge salad, and when it was taken away, the steak knife was taken also and I had to wait for some time when my steak was brought to ask for a new knife.

The steaks were cooked perfect for us but they had absolutely no flavor or seasonings on them.  They were also a bit tough and fatty.  Not something I was expecting for a place who calls themselves a steakhouse.  Also, with my wife's Grilled Fillet Medallions, we were told that it was Fillet medallions were of the same cut of beef that Fillet Mignon is from, but this most certainly was not... it was more of a sirloin cut and was quite tough and fatty which is not the norm for beef fillet.  In addition, no place on the menu does it say that the medallions are server over rice pilaf.  Not something that we were pleased with.

The service was also quite bothersome.  Our waitress (and others) was at our table about every 5 minutes just chatting... not asking if there was anything we needed.  We could hardly get a word in edgewise, enjoy our meal, or have a conversation between my wife and myself.

At the end of the mean, when we received our bill, we were quite upset that nothing was deducted off the entr√©e price because of the running out of potatoes, and all the prices seemed a bit high for what you get.  Bottom line, I doubt we will be back anytime soon.  There are many other mid ranged steak houses in the area that have far better service and quality, and I wonder how long this place will last in our area."}
{"text":"I have been coming here as a regular since 2010!! And my experiences have always been top notch. The owners Jim and his wife Pam are very friendly and care about your dining experience. I usually sit at the bar so that I can watch TV and talk but I want to give Kudos to Matt, Keith, Rita, Evelyn and Marina!! If you want to have good time and great meal without breaking your bank then please give Girves Brown Derby in Lyndhurst a chance!!! The cajun crusted salmon is the bomb!! The baked potatoes are huge and the filet medallions are tender and seasoned well. This is my home away from home!!"}
{"text":"The place looks nice, food not good. It took forever to get the food and it was cold. The server tried to overcharge us. Definitely not going there again."}
{"text":"Poor service, unwilling to provide lunch portions from the NYE menu at 1pm. Horrible attitude by waitress. The entire meal there was fruit flies including a giant fly in the middle of winter swarming the bread."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a very good steak at Brown Derby.
It was my husbands birthday and my girlfriends significant others birthday. The service was very good. Food was hot. The waitress took time to make certain the order was correct prior to leaving the table. The portions were very big! I enjoy going to Brown Derby. I enjoyed it last year at the same time. The food then was very good also."}
{"text":"Talk about being pleasantly surprised! We looked through the menu prior to having dinner here and honestly didn't expect too much because the prices are so low. But, it's right around the corner from our house and we both wanted steak, so we decided to give it a whirl. 
Our service was great! The decor reminded me of being home in the Adirondacks. We LOVED that they served the salad family style and brought us each our own dressings. Their rolls taste like my homemade yeast rolls. The steak was so tender and I did get the bleu cheese on top which was enough for both of our steaks. The potato was GIANT!! I had lunch for the next day too. We were too stuffed to try dessert. 
If you haven't tried this place, you need to! What a great value."}
{"text":"This is a great middle of the road steakhouse.  Has kind of an old school vibe to it, but not really.  It is open and bright on the inside.  The booths and tables are large and can facilitate larger parties.  The staff is nice and polite, but can be a little slow.  Only real issue I had with the waiter was that he did not quite think through the process.  You remove the bread plates and the appetizer plates before you bring out the main course.  There was a lot of plate mombo number 2 going on at our table.

So the food...
They brought out bread and butter to all of the tables.  Nice and warm.  We have the onion rings as the app.  They were huge thick cut, hot and crispy.  They are beer battered, so if you are not particular to beer batter, I would avoid.  

The youngest had the hotdog.  It was one of the huge all beef dogs.  Grilled nicely.  I had the ribeye, cooked medium rare.  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The meat itself was not a top quality meat, but then again, you are not paying for prime.  So for the price, I was really happy.  It came with a baked potato that was one of the best I have had in a long time.    Finally figured out it was because it was actually cooked in an over.  Great flavor.  There was also a chicken sandwich  ordered.  This was a hit as well.  The wife had their specialty salad and was extremely happy.  In the end, we had to haul away some Styrofoam. But they made for good left overs.  

Given that we fed 4 with an app ad got out for less than $50.00 with tip, I was really happy."}
{"text":"We arrived at 830 and was seated promptly.  The place wasn't at all busy, maybe 15 people in the whole place.  Took a few minutes for our waitress to arrive.  

Ordered the steak salad and the coconut shrimp.  Steak was prepared well.  Coconut shrimp was ok, not great.  Wouldn't order it again. 

Had to ask for refill on tea.  Waitress not attentive.  Could see this if place was busy.  

Just not happy this visit."}
{"text":"We only went here because my friend thought it was a longhorn steakhouse...
Anyway, the salad was fabulous! Had egg and cheese and everything in it!
The steak was enormous. But a little dry.
The baked potato was fabulous and enormous! Made me think of GMO potatoes though.
The mushroom topping was disgusting. looked like snot with mushrooms.
The stuffed mushroom appetizer was good, according to my friend.
The dinner rolls were very good.
Over all, it was average. I still like Longhorn better."}
{"text":"One of our favorite happy hour spots. If you can sit at the bar tables, you can get a great deal on wings, mozzarella sticks, mushrooms and onion rings! Service is great. Get a margarita!"}
{"text":"Four of us dined here for lunch this afternoon. including the appetizer it was around $120.00. This was 2 steak specials, smothered chicken, and a salmon dish (entrees included salad and a side). The food quality was all good, except for the onion appetizer which was dripping with grease and harder to eat then you're standard steakhouse onion plate. Mashed potatoes were good... saut√©ed muchrooms and onions were good... two steak eaters were happy (though not over the moon). Smothered chicken was flavorful and salmon was \"pretty okay\". And our waiter was a nice guy, cracked a few jokes, and had fun with us. So in the end it's pretty much the definition of a 3 out of 5. It wasn't bad really. It just wasn't anything too special. If I had a choice, I'd probably do Longhorn instead - especially based on the price."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and were seated right away.  Server came over quickly and explained daily specials. Food took forever to get to us. Considering it was not very crowded, this is not acceptable when you are on your lunch hour."}
{"text":"With all the choices to eat in Mentor, Ohio you'd think customer service would be a priority.  Not at the Brown Derby at Diamond Center...  

The prices were a tad high but the food was OK.  Our food came in a timely fashion and the waitress was attentive albeit a little cranky.  The decor and ambiance were average.  There was no room between the table and wall to get to the back of the booth (I'm not a \"big\" guy either).  We found it weird when we asked our waitress about menu items she disclosed she had eaten absolutely nothing in the restaurant.  Then the fun began.

(The short version) While in a group of 8 we requested separate checks for 4 different parties (understanding the gratuity would be added in).   We were told it would be best to keep the order on one check so the food would come out at the same time (huh?).  We were then told she'd break it up the orders at the end of the meal for payment.  Nope!  One Check!  45 minutes after dinner  we were fuming as we finally walked out the doors (for the first and last time).  The manager couldn't care less when discussing our situation. 

There are to many great places to go for dinner in and around Mentor.  This Brown Derby will no longer be one of them."}
{"text":"Gave this place another chance after a disappointing earlier visit. This one was just as bad. Don't want to get anyone in trouble, so suffice it to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"I went into (what is now a) Girves Brown Derby with very low expectations, especially since I assumed the experience would be comparable to those I had when this was Lone Star (peanuts on the floors!), Roadhouse, etc.  But given these low expectations, I left my meal completely and pleasantly shocked -- the food and service were nearly wonderful.

I sampled one of the steak dishes, which was cooked perfectly to order and full of flavor. Though the dish was a bit expensive, the meal was complemented with a large salad option and warm rolls. The service was kind and well-trained, and the management appeared to be well on-top of operations. 

As it turns out, this is a locally owned restaurant chain based out of Hudson, Ohio, which originated in the 1950s-60s. Though there are several locations, the Brown Derby name is exclusive to Ohio -- which is certainly an honorable and neat note.

Indeed. Girves Brown Derby is no Fleming's, in terms of ambiance and overall experience, but the somewhat lower prices, Ohio heritage, and food quality make for a nice steak-night option.

Grade: A-"}
{"text":"Ordered steak medium well.came raw blood rolling out.server returned with same steak burnt.was this revenge for sending back.i told server and nothing was done and was charged
Answer I ate salad and rolls
Yikes that is terrible."}
{"text":"Was Roadhouse ... new owner has taken over and returned it to Brown Derby ... very good again.  Salad, steak, sides are very tasty.  Revamped interior and menu.  Service was very, very good.  New owner is Jim and his wife are nice people who know how to run a restaurant.
Try it again, I liked it a lot and best of all it is very clean."}
{"text":"The steaks at this restaurant were really good but that's as far as it goes.  The rolls were dry and tasted old and the baked sweet potato was so over cooked that it was total mush. The waitress was really poor and didn't offer us condiments until our meal was more than half over. We won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Oddly quiet on  a Friday night at 6:30.   Overall the food was good and the service ok but nothing special.  No wait for a table.  We ordered drinks from a server then another person brought out our drinks and gave my wife my beer and me her iced tea.  Ok, whatever.  Then we order our meal and it arrived timely, but again another person brought out the meal and tried to give my wife my entr√©e.   They just seem really confused which was concerning given the place was pretty dead.  Honestly you should just go to Longhorn or Texas Road House if you want a steak dinner as the prices are the same."}
{"text":"I rarely order a steak but I did on a recommendation. The steak was cooked to order and was a nice cut but a lot of fat. The service here was fast and courteous. You can't go wrong with a baked potato here. Good stuff. There wasn't anything exceptional here but it seems to be a reliable steakhouse."}
{"text":"Ordered the scallops and had to send them back because they tasted like they were rolled in salt. Horrible. Was offered something else but everyone else was almost finished eating so declined. to my surprise, the waiter was told by the owner to charge us for the vegetables that were left on the table. When I asked to see the owner she came to the table with a nasty attitude. She was so rude, and told us 'you may have a problem with it but we don't\". How do they stay in business, zero customer service. A crappy meal, crappy attitude and a filthy interior."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give it no stars. First off not sure what the other reviewer was talking about when they said unlimited salad when it says right inside the menu no refills on salad. So maybe that has changed since June. I also noticed the hostess when people wanted to sit for instance near the fireplace gave people a difficult time. Now I understand about seating people according to a rotation so the waitstaff isn't cut out of tips, but if someone wants to sit at a particular table or like I said near the fireplace (and I mean it's not the customer's fault they only have one fireplace) then I really don't think the hostess should be arguing with the customer. In fact this happened twice in the span of ten minutes and the second time the hostess gave in which made me wonder what about the first people who asked. And I mention this because the whole place seems to run that way. Now our waitress was pretty good and actually the only thing about the entire experience that didn't just out and out suck. It was just me and my mother and we both ordered the Top Sirloin. I am a stickler for food coming out hot and the steak was at best warm heck even the plate it was on wasn't that hot, but I was almost going to let it go because the giant baked potato (why they put the butter and sour cream inside of the potato is beyond me) was relatively hot so I figured maybe I should just quit while I was ahead. That was before I looked at my steak which (and I have never seen anything like this before not at a restaurant or when buying steak at the grocery store) had all of this sinewy stuff in the middle of the steak. Sinewy is really the only word that comes close to describing it and my mother's was the same. Plus we ordered them medium and they weren't medium. So when the waitress came to check on us we told her and she took them back and then the manager came out and though he didn't seem to really care all that much his attitude got a little better when he came out a second time. Okay so when the second steaks arrived (and it took forever) they looked better and were hot, but now they were beyond tough. And when the manager came back out to check on us and I mentioned this to him he said he would adjust the bill, but because we were taking them with us he couldn't comp the entire bill. News flash we didn't want anything for free WE JUST WANTED STEAK AND DARE I SAY ACTUALLY EDIBLE. Not something passed off as Top Sirloin that I wouldn't even feed my dog if I had a dog. And then I started to notice that a number of other tables around us were also talking to their waitperson about adjustments to their bill and one gentleman mentioned that he saw only one person in the kitchen cooking. So ya if you're going to call yourself a steakhouse then have someone who knows how to actually cut a steak properly and then also how to cook it properly. Oh and Brown Derby for the $17 that one of these Top Sirloins cost how about at the very least having it actually being Top Sirloin. The manager did end up comping us one of the meals, but again that's not the point. If you want a middle of the road steakhouse steer clear of this place and also steer clear of Austin's on Wilson Mills which when you order a steak they slice them so you're only getting half of your steak. Instead of all of these companies trying to come up with clever ways to screw their customers why not just serve a quality product because if you did that people would actually come back to your establishment and wouldn't write reviews like this warning other people of your nefarious practices. Oh and hire a hostess who actually understands what it means to be a host because she was just rude."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here roughly 4 times over 7 months or so. Out of the 4 times 3 of them were bad and once was semi decent. Our most recent visit was Last night 12/10/2014 We had a little bit of money to spend left on a gift card(Which the first time we tried to use it they claimed there card reader was down and we had to have another form of payment) When you go with a gift card you don't go assuming you really need money! Any ways back to what I was saying We went last night for dinner. My wife and I always get the top sirloin steak. I asked for mine to be medium rare and mine came out medium and my wife asked for medium and hers came out well done. Now I can understand if your jam packed or busy and overcooking or messing up a order but honestly there were only 2 or 3 others and they were all at the bar so this establishment was pretty dead. Needless to say I ate 80% of my steak and my wife ate less then half of hers. Our rolls were old stale and crumbly. No issues with our salad we did order 6 wings since on Wednesdays they  are 50 cents each. we got 2 bbq 2 garlic butter and 2 teriyaki. The teriyaki seemed to just be dipped in soy sauce not actual coating or sauce on it the bbq were average local bars do it better and cheaper and the garlic and butter were horrid with canned bitter garlic piled on top of my two wings yuck! Our server was just average never really came to see if we needed more to drink or anything else for that matter. If I'm paying 1.99$ for pop I expect refills to try to get my moneys worth.Like I stated above 1 good meal out of 4 does not make this place worth our time and certainly does not make me want to spend my hard earned money on them. You can certainly get a better steak at outback or Texas roadhouse. I just don't get paying roughly $40 on two meals and a drink and leaving unhappy. We won't be going back. I suggest reading all the reviews on yelp first before deciding whether or not you want to try this establishment."}
{"text":"Medium Well Porterhouse, Loaded Baked Potato and Crispy French Fries. 
My meal was amazing. Steaks are a little bit over priced but their sides are pretty large. My steak was cooked perfectly. 
They didn't have many side options. \"Mixed Veggies, Baked Potato, Rice Pilaf and fries\" are their main sides."}
{"text":"It was T-Bone Tuesday and the steaks were Great!   Our waitress Nicki was friendly, provided exceptional customer service  and made excellent recommendations!   
I can't rave enough about the ice cold beer, the homemade rolls and the warm brownie sundae with the melting ice cream- save room for it!   Visiting from Michigan but will make a must stop when back this way."}
{"text":"Dependable food, service is really good, bar serves amazing drinks. Prices are very reasonable especially the drinks. Salad bowl, yeast rolls, gigantic sweet or white potatoes. Steak is king, but fish is also good. Not fancy, not expensive, not boring. Give them a try. We go a couple times a month. Tell Jim (owner) hello. Joyce is amazing."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a relative. She said she had not eaten here in 30+ years, so I am assuming there is an \"original\" location somewhere.  This one is located in a strip mall and not a stand alone restaurant.  I noticed right away the parking lot was full on a Sunday and only 2 other businesses were open, so figured that was a good sign. And I was correct. Ordered the T-Bone, on the recommendation of the waiter, and it was awesome!  Cooked perfectly! The price was right, too--16 oz steak, choice of potato and a salad for $19.99. What a bargain!"}
{"text":"Now that I've eaten here...I know for d@mn sure that I won't be going back. The prices are fair for a \"meh\" steakhouse, but this place is not worth venturing out for. I had the NY strip with steamed veggies and we split an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms. The steak was a bit overcooked, my veggies arrived cold and the mushrooms were just a glob of oil and sauce. Ended up literally sick to my stomach by the time we got home. Never again."}
{"text":"I hate this place. The food is loaded in MSG. And you leave feeling sick . Service was not that great and food wasn't prepared right."}
{"text":"The food was Great with friendly service. And there was an unlimited salad, which was a bonus. The prices were great based upon the quality of food. We were seated quickly on a fairly busy Sunday afternoon. The food was served hot as well. This is definitely a place that my family and I will visit again. We also noted that there are specials during the week that we cannot wait to try out."}
{"text":"Silly fun at the bar. Yes, the neighborhood is going down the toilet. But the folks at Brown Derby are fighting the good fight. Where else can you get a really decent T-bone steak with all the sides, salad, and bread for 1599? Sandy, our bartender makes Incredible martinis. Service all around is top-notch, and the value is truly unbeatable. We're going to come back just for dessert next time. Their fudge brownie sundae is insane. It's like eating a whole chocolate cake, made in house and just fantastic. We hope they can hang in there. Monday Tuesday and Wednesday is an amazing bargain. Besides the aforementioned T-Bone, they have twin pork chops for $14. Expertly prepared and all the sides were perfect. Again, a truly great value"}
{"text":"The potatoes was cooked great. The shrimp were pretty tasty but the steak was not the best. Price is great though. I used to go to the brown Derby in Sandusky. This is not the same ambiance but it was clean and the food was served quickly."}
{"text":"Horrible dining experience! Went for my brothers birthday. Lisa Case the owner has ZERO customer service skills. My family dines here often and I have absolutely no reason why. The food is lack luster and their service is sub par! After this experience I will never return. I ordered the seafood platter and my lobster tail tasted like over cooked squid TOUGH! We sent it back and received a very minimal adjustment to the bill. When I spoke with Lisa she said that was as good as it was going to get. It wouldn't have taken anything to adjust the bill appropriately. While I understand there is a bottom line but after sending the tail back the cost of the meal was still $30 for 12 shrimp, a baked potato and two mushroom caps. This is Brown Derby and not Hyde Park right?  Won't get another dime of my money. I have other comments but those are kind of rude so I'll keep those as thoughts."}
{"text":"I have been to this Brown Derby twice in the past two weeks and have thoroughly enjoyed thed chicken dishes.  I like the one with the BBQ sauce, cheese, and scallions.  Add the delicious salad and rolls and it's a great meal for the price.  My mother enjoys the Filet tips which have been properly cooked per request each time.  I noticed that this Brown Derby recently removed the \"Roadhouse\" from their name and has gone back to the classier \"Girves\" sign.  Prices and menu seem the same."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to brown derby to enjoy what we hoped would be the best meal that we've had in a while.

Our check ran to around $100 with two beers, two steaks, two lobster tails, potatoes, and calamari as an appetizer.

The waiter was good and prompt. He made sure everything was okay and checked for refills.

Although cooked properly, the food was not really all that great. If I am in mentor and I want a $20 steak I will go to longhorn. Their food is just better. Everything at the brown derby was relatively bland."}
{"text":"My party and I arrived at 4:00pm when the restaurant opened. When seated in a booth I could pick up a whiff of something that didn't smell good but could not locate it. Looking around everything was clean except for the front door glass that was covered by fingerprints. I normally order a steak but decided on the fried shrimp with sweet baked potato. I also had their side salad and very warm delicious rolls and the service was good."}
{"text":"6/8/2014:  YOU CAN NOT BLACKMAIL INTO WHAT I DO AND DON'T SAY.  YOUR SERVICE AND RESTAURANT SUCK.  PLAIN AND SIMPLE.  You claim you wrote me; yet I never got the email.  Anyway can \"fake\" sending an email.  

I called.  I called.  I called.  YOU NEVER CALLED ME BACK.  Messages \"were taken\" - my 24/7 cell phone number was left with my messages.  When I asked the message taker to repeat my number to me I was told \"I have it... no problem\" and they hung up.  WHICH MEANS - 9 times out of 10, they NEVER WROTE IT DOWN!!!!  I was probably speaking to you.  And that's when I contacted home office.  YOU CAN NOT IGNORE PEOPLE - and if you do - you lose business and customers.  LIVE WITH YOUR DECISION.....  

I can't believe the home office even allows you to use their name.  This is a huge HUGE reflection on their part.  As well as trying to talk with me about the problems we encountered.  Blasting me on Yelp --- it's AMERICA bud - and I can say what I want and when I want too. 

Everything I said was TRUE - Believe it or not.  I don't care.  But other people out there WILL CARE - infact - check out my wall.  Two friends read my review of your crappy service and cold food and said they would NOT NOT NOT ever eat there.

I hope your doors close - you deserve it.

{"text":"I was soooo hoping the other reviews were wrong. Our service was great today. Unfortunately, the food wasn't. They used to have a half chicken with a side of garlic red skin mashed potatoes that I would travel 2 hours for! What a disappointment. They have neither on the menu any more. They have a $1 off happy hour through out the restaurant, tho, from 4-7. I liked the hypnotic drink on their menu. Yummy, fruity and loaded! It was enough to make me forget the huge let down of the terribly wilted salad and crumbly bread they call \"rolls\". Unfortunately, this place is no longer on my list of favs when it comes to food. If I HAVE to come back, will stick to drinks."}
{"text":"5/8/16 6:30 pm reservation. WOW what a disaster. Party of 7. MOTHERS DAY.made reservations a week ago. Wanted to make sure the mothers in this party could have PRIME RIB!!. actually we wanted 7:00pm but made a 6:30 appt. To make sure they did not run out of prime rib. Everyone showed up and we're seated on time. Drinks came slow but ok. Prime rib was ordered and our waitress even left and came back to confirm that they still had prime rib. 40 minutes layer our waitress came back and said there was no prime rib. NO PRIME RIB!!  everybody had finished their meals and finally the people ordered got whatever kind of steak in a Styrofoam container. HAPPY MOTHERS DAY. REALLY IN A FOAM BOX???? and this also happened 2 weeks ago for a 75th birthday party we were having. The horse face manager laughed and thought it was funny. So we got the owner over to our table, the guy in the wheelchair. Telling us basically it was our fault??? Really?? I did not even eat and was charged for.a 10 oz. Fillet mignon, and I did not even eat, no food came for me. At all nothing. It took forever for them to figure out if they brought me a steak or not. WOW this is a brown derby, I thought this meant something of quality. SAVE YOUR MONEY, GO ANYWHERE ELSE. WHAT BS I would give negative stars if I could"}
{"text":"i dont feel like writing a long review so heres the low lights and high lights. 
my dinner guest's meal was wrong , she didint complain or send it back, she liked it actually. my meal was good. the server was ok, my main complaint is i ordered desert and i got a standard vanilla ice cream, she asked me if i wanted some chocolate or Carmel, i asked for a little bit of chocolate, what i got, was alot of chocolate. the waitress saw me scraping the excess chocolate  and didint ask about it or anything. then i get up to go to the rest room, when i get back my desert was gone. i came back and asked where it went. she said \"oh well i thought you were done, so i took it\" there was a good 3rd of it left. she didint even ask the people i was with if it was ok to take it. my dinner party actually asked me if i wanted another one, not the waitress. she made no offer to make it right. so im gonna write a letter to their cooperate office and let them know how unacceptable this is. i will never come here again."}
{"text":"I always pass by this place, but never really bothered to stop by until a friend suggested we eat here one night. It's a fairly large place, and we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. We had a group of six, which they were easily able to seat quickly-even without reservation. 

I was in the mood for surf and turf, so I got the lobster tail and filet mignon. The filet was alright, not the best I've had. Maybe a bit more tough than I would've liked the meat to be. The lobster was decent, although I can't imagine how you could mess that up. The servers were nice, and overall we had a decent meal and good convo! It's not the fanciest steak place I've been to, but they will fulfill your meat cravings and save you some money!"}
{"text":"How I wish I could rate this restaurant with zero stars. Seriously. This is a steakhouse that should truly be ashamed of itself. I was dragged here on a family event and - surprise, surprise - during Christmas vacation it was DEAD. I should have noted that hugely bad omen since any other restaurant in the area would have been packed to the gills for the holiday.

I knew I was also going to be in trouble since I was a vegetarian at a steakhouse. I had gone in though knowing that there was a 99% chance I was only going to be able to eat a house salad, and I was correct. Everything else is meat. When the salad arrived, I noted that it was standard, straight-from-a-plastic-bag salad with those indicative red cabbage strips and whiter-than-Igloo-Azalea iceberg lettuce. But the true horror were the cherry tomatoes which when I popped one into my mouth, I immediately had to spit it out. Brown, clearly rotten tomato gunk oozed from it, and I dashed to the bathroom to just get away from it. (Bathrooms were satisfactory but nothing to write home about.) I had ordered a baked potato as well and it was fine, but after the salad fiasco, I had lost my appetite.

Now, this is a steakhouse, so my vegetarianism should be noted AGAIN. However, I also noticed that every single one of my relatives' dishes were improperly cooked. The cousin's filet was very well-done despite being asked for medium-rare, the sirloin blood-red for my grandmother who only eats charred meat. It was very much a mess.

I feel bad for the waitstaff who were very courteous and who probably made close to no tips since this restaurant was deserted. But this is 2015: put one vegetarian dish on the menu and if you're going to be a steakhouse, please, please, PLEASE properly cook your flagship dishes."}
{"text":"Dined here with my wife and MIL. Rolls were delicious, salad was fresh and house dressing tasty. MIL and myself both got sirloin and both were cooked exactly as ordered and were way more tender than any sirloin has a right to be (albeit with a healthy chunk of fat on hers). She also got the grilled shrimp which she enjoyed. Wife got chargrilled chicken and rice. She liked the rice but found that the chicken was dry and lacked flavor except for the char-grilling. The waiter was polite, professional and just attentive enough. Nearly perfect experience minus the chicken."}
{"text":"Just went to this locations with friend.  Our server Eveline was wonderful.  However my friends streak came out well done when she ordered it medium.  Second steak came out rare.  When we spoke to the manager Lisa who offered an third steak or to comp the meal if we left the one on the kitchen late but if we wanted to take the raw steak home it would cost us $22.  The supermarket offered far better price if I want to cook the steak myself.  By the time the second steak arrived I had completed my meal.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Boyfriend & I came here as another place we were going to locally was out of steak! So we came here as a second choice. OMG, from now on this place will be our first choice! The best steak I've had in years! Beautiful brown crust on the outside, and moist, tender, juicy steak on the inside. Cooked to perfection. Prices are not bad either. From now on this will be our go to steak place."}
{"text":"So I walk into the Brown Derby, hatless myself, looking for somewhere to feast. I remember the Derby from when I was a wee lad and my aunt ordered the Grogg (which they still have). It was a nice place for our family to go and eat.
     My how times have changed. This place is darkly lit, which I guess is to hide the many empty seats. I'm seated pretty quickly, and a friendly waitress takes my drink order. Well that's a good sign, right?
      Then I open the menu. Pricey, but it's pricey compared to steakhouse chains, not fine dining expensive. So my expectations rise as I order filet, with a baked potato.
     The salad comes out, large with a nice grouping of ingredients. It's just short of a chef's salad, and it's a pleasant start to the meal.
     Now comes the steak, and I order an old fashioned to wash it down. The steak is a 10 oz filet, and it's not bad, but it's not blowing my dress up. The baked potato with bacon, scallions, sour cream, cheese, and butter is much more flavorful and filling than my bland steak. 
     The more I eat, the less pleased I am with the filet. I finish it, but that's the wnd of the meal. The service was pleasant, the old fashioned wasn't bad, but at this price point 'not bad' might as well be, in the words of Gordon Ramsay, 'bloody f#@king awful!'"}
{"text":"This is a solid three star  mainly because the waiter was great and my steak was cooked to perfection. I just think it is a bit overpriced!

The place was clean - time from order to eating was good and no issue with parking!"}
{"text":"I'm new in town and just wanted a decent steak. The prices matched the quality. I'll be going back again when my parents come into town. Don't expect some fancy top of the line steak house. As someone already said, it's a great middle of the road steakhouse."}
{"text":"The Derby!!   The 4 stars are primarily for the steak special they run M-W, 1-lb plus T-Bone Porterhouse Dinner for $14.95 (up from $13.95).  The steak is nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection.  This steak with the baked or sweet potato and unlimited salad is enough to be clutching your sides as you wobble out of this place.  

The bar is large, restaurant is open, kind of a log cabinish feel, and they do have cold beer on tap along with a few nice wines.  It's comfortably lit and real 'homey' inside.  I've got nothing but the steak because why would you?  I will say that the last two I've had there, BD slacked a little on the filet side of beef but made up for it by giving me a HUGE strip portion.  Just look at the photo tagged along with the reviews and that's darn hard to resist in my eyes. 

We are such carnivores!!  Now go get you some.  For you anal beef types, it is USDA Choice and USDA Prime."}
{"text":"We have fond memories of the old Brown Derby, so we were looking forward to trying this one.  We were very disappointed.  It's just OK. 

The menu's description of the spicy onion appetizer led us to believe that it would be similar in taste to a Bloomin' Onion, which is my husband's all-time favorite.  Not.  The onion rings themselves were great, but not at all spicy, and we couldn't taste the advertised horseradish in the sauce.  

Our server told us that our salad would be served \"family style\", so I asked her if dressings would be brought to the table. No, you get the house ranch.  My husband hates ranch, so she had our salad made with Italian dressing.  But we wouldn't have known even that if I hadn't asked.  She also didn't mention that it comes with cheese, which he also dislikes.  

Our steaks were perfectly cooked and very tender.  My husband liked his, but I found mine pretty tasteless.  And \"butter and sour cream\" on your baked potato means you get a scoop of each slapped on top.

No reason to go back -- there are several steak restaurants in the area that serve much better food for about the same price."}
{"text":"Not worth the prices they charge. Food was ok, service was mediocre, decor was average. This restaurant wont last long with the way it currently is. Shame!"}
{"text":"Here is my thoughts on this place... we decided to do dinner 1 night here the food is partly the issue... for example for salad had no taste ( it was bland ) and even though the food was okay... the prices are extremely high ( 20 bucks most of their dishes ) the main problem was our service.... but a big piece of advice... do not order the pulled pork nachos... its a huge disappointment.. all that was on it was chips, a little bit of cheese, and barely enough pork for one person :( I recommend you stay far away from this place"}
{"text":"I am not happy with the meal tonight. I ordered the New York Strip and this is a sad looking piece of meat. The steak is mostly fat. We also ordered the Lobster Tail and for some reason it was tough as shoe leather.

I do not know if I will come here again for a meal."}
{"text":"I had the t-bone wife had the ny strip.  Both was cooked as ordered.  They bake their bread/rolls fresh in house. They also cut their own meat so don't be surprised if you come late and they have run out of that cut of steak.  Overall nice dinner."}
{"text":"Really great food. I had the T Bone it was fantastic. The service is great.  We really enjoyed this restaurant. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The salad and bread were good. The service was okay - he'd forget stuff he said he'd bring.  The steak was poor - little flavor and poorly trimmed for a filet.  Add to all that - high prices.  Just doesn't add up.  Listen to the reviews, find another place."}
{"text":"During our annual visit to Ohio we were treated to dinner here.  There were eight of us on a Friday night.  Downside:  we ended up waiting almost one hour to be seated because of some mess up.  We were comped on our drinks and received a giant appy platter and excellent service from out waiter.  In a nutshell, the food was so delish and everything else went so well after we were seated I had to give them five stars!

The atmosphere is casual and cozy, the front area has about four  or five chairs and is large enough to accommodate our group of eight without being squeezed in.  I like the barrel of peanuts at the entryway, you can help yourself while you wait to be seated.  Also, you can see the kitchen and watch them cook up the steaks behind the glass windows.

The comped appy included french fries, giant onion rings, large pieces of chicken and mozzerella sticks.  They have very good fries and the mozzerella stick were good too...I'm not an onion ring person so didn't try that and didn't want to fill up before my steak was served.  There were four dipping sauces, ranch, horseradish, salsa and one other tomato type dip.  All very good.  The bowl of salad was so huge we couldn't finish it all but it was very tasty!  Their house dressing was delicious!  And the rolls they brought out, wow!  I had difficulty not eating more, they were soft and tasty as well.  I ordered the 9 oz. Choice Sirloin, done medium with rice pilaf.  The steak was SO tender and juicy, yum!  The pilaf was a bit salty, I normally use salt, pepper and ketchup on my steaks but didn't add anything since the pilaf made up for it.  

This meal was really delicious from beginning to end!  The waiter was on spot with our orders and filled out glasses quickly.  Great service from him!  

All in all I would definitely go back on our next trip to Ohio!"}
{"text":"My friend is a regular, so we went there. I was pleasantly surprised! They were very very busy, so we sat at the bar. The service was great, the staff very friendly, I had salmon which was fresh and huge! My friend had a strip steak which I tasted and it was fabulous. Definitely a place that I will go back to. You can tell that the owners are very hands-on and the staff enjoys working there."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Matt, our waiter, was wonderful! The steak was prepared exactly how requested. The sweet potatoes were ... HUGE!   Matt even gave us the inside scoop as to why the potatoes were so big- and helped us with directions to the freeway when we left."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with my extended family. I was not expecting much since my past experiences here have been underwhelming. Our hostess handed us dirty menus. The menus had food remnants on them. Also I am very allergic to mites and had the unfortunate experience of sitting in a chair whose prior occupant has mites. I began itching almost immediately.  I switched chairs and tried to carry on and survive the family lunch. The server was friendly but not well trained. He attempted to serve a 10 person round table by standing in one spot. Which resulted in him reaching over plates and asking guests to pass food around. The food itself was poorly prepared our appetizers were burnt. My steak was well done and not Medium as I requested. The second steak was medium but not seared thus flavorless. Also the bathrooms do not have hot water so I wonder how clean the employees hands are???? Overall I would say do not waste your time or money in this restaurant."}
