{"text":"Great place.  In a dollarstore / wild wing plaza, shouldn't be amongst these establishments.  Service at times is a hit and miss, it all depends how busy they get, which they do.  If they are busy and they're storming by you, flag them down.  
Huge delicious dumplings and one of the species kimchi I've tried in Toronto. 

4.5 baby!"}
{"text":"DO NOT eat at this restaurant. I felt i got ripped off ! I and my friend ordered the spicy hotpot and $15 for one person. The plate came with little bit of veggies, 2 pieces of mushroom, 1 thin piece of potato, 1 piece of carrot, 10-15 tiny pieces of beef. The whole thing cost $33 after tax for 2 person. The portion was way too small for this kind of price. However, I had to ask the server whether this combo comes with a plate of noodles as it mentioned on the menu. They didn't give it to us until we asked.. I felt like the restaurant was ripping people off....Don't expect any services. All the servers don't speak English...speak only Korean...so don't bother to try this restaurant out unless you are willing to waste your money"}
{"text":"Despite this restaurant being open for a while now, this was my first time trying it. The food was so good, I'm surprised I didn't hear about this place earlier! Perhaps its the name of the restaurant. I was actually recommending this restaurant to someone else yesterday, and had quite a bit of difficulty communicating the restaurant name. I'm sure in Korean it is probably less of a weird mouthful of words. 

I'm surprised that people were told not to take pictures. My friend Jess and I took lots of pictures and nobody came to give us any trouble. We even asked one of the waitresses to take pictures of us in them!

After we ordered the waitress brings us a huge pot (not those usual tiny petri dishes) of store made kimchi. It was some of the best I've had; it was sweet and didn't have the strong potent smell that is sometimes too much for me to handle.

We ordered a table top (shabu shabu) cooking for 2 ($14.99 per person portion, and you need to order at least 2 portions), which had a good mixture of vegetables, thinly sliced beef, glutinous dumplings, and noodles. Really good quality ingredients, and the noodles that come with it are exceptional! We cooked them last so they would soak up all the flavours from the soup. yums!

On top of that we ordered Mixed dumpling and rice cake soup ($8.99). The waitress thought we were crazy for ordering more food on top of the shabu shabu, but we couldn't resist! Like others say, these dumplings are gigantic! They are jam packed with ground pork, shredded egg, seaweed, and other good stuff. Absolutely loved this!

At the end of it, my friend and I left very full and happy :)"}
{"text":"Still delicious! We had noodles and dumplings this time. The bowl of noodles was large, and had some veggies and minced meat. The noodles are housemade and tasted good, but was a tad overcooked. Dumplings are still the best dish here! 

Restaurant was pretty busy even though it was late on a weeknight. Definitely a local favourite!"}
{"text":"Love the noodles here and the large dumplings are the best. Although, the soup base taste a bit like the instant noodle kind. Anyone know if it's home made?

WARNING!! It is a sauna in here. It's hot hot hot. They need better ventilation. I'm not sure how they do business in the summer."}
{"text":"Terrible! A total rip-off!

First off, the menu is very confusing as it says the lunch special is for 2, yet the menu price is for only 1. We ordered it anyway. It is a very small amount of food for the price. A few thinly sliced pieces of beef and a couple of vegetables. That's it! I've had shabu-shabu many times in my life, and never felt hungry afterwards. 

Second, we ordered the king dumplings to fill us up. They were huge, but tasteless. Like eating a lump of newspaper. And there aren't many options for making a sauce to add some flavour to them. 

Third, none of the wait staff speaks any English. I realize it is a Korean restaurant, but I didn't realize speaking Korean was mandatory to get service. 

Overall a pretty horrible experience. I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"As of recent, I believe they have purchased a neon \"Open\" sign. 

In any case, the first time I was actually in the restaurant, I was rather impressed. The environment was clean, crisp and humble, nicely air conditioned and well lit. My party of 4 (of course, every one of them spoke Korean but me...) walked in at about 8:40pm, not knowing that they close at 9pm. We should have figured considering it's in a residential area, but being oblivious, we walked in bowed and said our hellos in Korean. 

They were quite courteous and although the woman seating us looked a little tired, she did not give off any angry or \"leave now!\" vibes. Upon placing the menus in front of each of us, she let us know (in Korean) that Shabu-Shabu is not available at this time, and we may only select from the noodle/soup selection. 

What we ordered:

2x Man Doo Guk- Fish stock/broth base with sliced rice cake, and their signature giant dumpling, with slivers of sliced vegetables

Kal Guk Soo- a hot noodle with what I believe is the same fish stock/broth base with a little spiced oil, minus the dumplings, with sliced leek

Hwang Man Doo- Signature KING sized dumplings... These are GIANT!

Still not realizing that they close at 9, we waited for our food, chit chat-ed and were graced with some of the best kim chi I've ever had. They serve the kim chi in a separate mini urn type jar, so as to give us a good amount, so there is no stingy ban chan (Korean appetizer dishes) attitude, but is still hygienic. To my surprise, however, the kim chi is actually the ONLY ban chan they serve. Along with the kim chi, they serve cold water to start. 

When our food came, I was delighted to be able to touch my bowl without burning myself. The bowls they use to hold the soup and noodles is a thermos-like, insulated bowl, so it is not hot to the touch. The portion is quite large and filling, I could not finish the entire order of my man doo guk, but the taste is absolutely wonderful--- it was clean tasting, well flavored and very genuine in Korean taste. The dumplings were gigantic but also savory. 

I later came back to try the kal guk soo and the shabu-shabu, both of which were to the same level of quality and scrumptious satisfaction as the first in-store visit. Personally, I was never fond of the cold soy noodle, so I don't think I'll be testing that out, but I don't doubt it also exceeds standards."}
{"text":"I love this place! They don't have a lot on their menu in terms of variety of options but what they have, they do very well. I always get the noodles with an order of dumplings and go crazy with the pot of kimchi as the side dish. Their kimchi is amazing! It goes really well with the noodles and dumplings. The only thing is that if you're not a fan of garlic, that kimchi might not be for you. The garlic is strong but that's the good part in my opinion because it brings out the sweetness in the kimchi which pairs well with the main dishes. Nice, clean, modern interior is also good too. Service gets the job done.

Overall, I definitely recommend this place. I always go when I'm back at home because I missed that sweet kimchi."}
{"text":"Dammit Dammit Dammit, my girl met up with her girlfriend and 2 kids and went skating and decided to come here, I decided to join them and showed up late, I had 3 leftover Kingsized dumplings and some cold kimchi noodles and it floored me, it was great tasting, left with it replaying in my mind until I bossed my girl back there after 2 months, this time we had the shabu shabu special for 2 and it topped my first experience, wow, next very next week (last weekend) we went back with a friend and now he's got dumplings on his mind, I dropped the dumpling info on my sister and can't wait until she tries the food, she's going to go bonkers with the dumplings she's going to flip the tables after she's done!  No joke, this is in my top 2 korean restaurants in all of ontario."}
{"text":"Will never go back to this resto. Menu and Pics deceive customers. Pic of menu posted mention it is good for 2. Price is for one person. If you don't check the fine print you will think the price is for 2. Many have been shocked liked they were charged double. I don't understand the reason for the price per person thing. This is the practice in Korean restaurants. Most of them even require you to order 2 main courses when some of their food is good for 2 already. If food is good for 2 they should post the price correctly. It is not worth at all for another reason. The raw beef to be cooked shabu shabu style does not resemble how much it is in the picture. We actually counted 59 pieces of beef in the menu picture. Actual number of pieces was 22. I call this deception. It would have been acceptable if the difference was minimal. Furthermore, the first server who barely speaks English confirmed to us that the price posted is for 2. Then the 2nd server came around to tell us that the price was to be double because posted price was for one person. We ended up paying so much for little. Will never go back to this resto."}
{"text":"When you view the menu and you only see a few items you know the house specializes in that cuisine. The dumplings are to die for!, especially when you use the hot chilli soy sauce with it. The kimchi is never sour and the soup is light and refreshing, especially on a hot summers day! I enjoyed the casual and prompt service and would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Cross my fingers and hope to spit, this place has some good kimchee and hot sauce.

Co workers were craving some Korean food and suggested we go here.  The menu seemed sparse but I was told they specialize in a few items.  We ordered the dumplings and soup noodles.  No shabu shabu for us today.  The dumplings were pretty good.  The experience with the dumplings was probably enhanced by their hot sauce.  Hot sauce had a good balance of heat and flavor.  

The noodles were decent, noodles had a good texture, however, the soup kinda tasted like instant noodle soup. Dump in a few spoons of the hot sauce and the soup is transformed.  Abracadabra...from instant soup to a awesome broth.   Although busy, service was decent.  

As for the kimchee, this is one of the best kimchees I've had.  This kimchee is not overly sour and has a fresh taste.  Some prefer stronger more fermented flavor of kimchee but not me.   Minus the kimchee and hot sauce, this place is just average.  That being said, the 2 condiments will get me coming back."}
{"text":"We visited this place a couple of times. Not many choices on menu which is fine. The service was TERRIBLE!! Waitresses were too busy chatting in the back. We have seen better services and even smile from waitresses to Korean customers. We chose to go there because there are not many quality options in the area."}
{"text":"Bad bad food!  Bad services !!!!   U can find better Korean somewhere in town !  Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Few variety of food on menu. Not many choices to choose from.  Huge dumplings were tasty, although soup was really salty.  
It would be even better if the soup does not contain that much of MSG !!   Service was so far so good."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends last Sunday after hearing that their dumplings were huge! I love dumplings....I'd probably say that they are one of my favourite things to eat...so I had to check this place out! 

The restaurant had a fair number of korean customers...a good sign in my opinion.  My husband and I both believe that if an ethnic restaurant has a fair number of customers of its particular ethnicity going...it's probably a pretty decent place to eat (for example....you don't seem many Chinese people eating at Manchu wok).  

We ordered the dumplings to share and it came with 6 large dumplings! They were stuffed with meat and leek and were absolutely delicious.  It was perfectly seasoned and juicy! So good! 

My friend and I ordered the rice cake soup with more dumplings which was delicious.  The broth was flavourful and I love rice cakes! haha 

My husband and our friend ordered the other hot noodle dish which I thought was even better.  The texture of the noodles were perfect and I felt that the broth tasted even better.

I felt that the price was a little more expensive than what you would get at a typical Chinese dumpling joint.  Overall, the dumplings and noodles were delish and I would definitely recommend it and come again!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday. Fairly busy, but not busy enough for a lineup. 

I'm usually not a huge fan of Kimchi but this one was amazing! It had a strong garlic flavour too, so better avoid if you cannot avoid to have garlic breath for the next few hours! The kimchi is a starter, and also free. 

King-sized dumplings are ginormous! They are flavourful and can be pretty filling too. Definitely recommend! 

I got the dumplings + rice cake soup. Highly recommend this if you want to try the dumplings but don't want just dumplings."}
{"text":"We wont go back to this place!  Big dumpling,  but not so tasty!  Noodle was okay only.  Hot pot is very expensive with small portion!!!  Don't waste your money here!  Also the service is so bad, and rude! !"}
{"text":"Below average food, bad service, way too fucking overpriced. Do not order the hotpot they charge you $32 for a plate of stuff thats worth 15$. I just moved near the area but definetely never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"It is full when we walk into the restaurant at 6:30pm.  We have to sit a while before a table is available.

Eye catching is the king of the dumplings. It has 6 of them with leek and meat.  The size is gigantic.  Although the meat portion is more than the leek, you won't have a stuffy and oily feeling.  The dumpling wrap is thin enough but can still hold all its content when lifting up without breaking. You can easily consume them all.  So that's why we continue to have an extra order.  

I heard all noodles are made by the restaurant.  The texture is very good.  It has the elasticity and slight chewy feeling.  The Noodle has a small topping of small quantity of beef pieces, onion and cucumber.  If you stir it, all these toppings will mix with the broth and hard to get them unless you drink all the soup.  The soup is very tasty.  It is a custom to drink the soup together with the noodle.  Another noodle is in Cold Soy Bean Soup.  The bean soup is quite thick but the bean is blended to be very fine.  If having the noodle and drink all the soup, definitely will fill most of your stomach.

The stainless steel bowl is hollow inside so even the soup is very hot, when you hold it, it will not burn your fingers.  The Kimchi is served in a porcelain pot like restaurant in Korea.  The only item I find that is different from a Korean restaurant is that it doesn't have the metallic chopstick, instead bamboo chopstick is provided.

The price of the noodle is medium, more pricey than Chinese but less expensive than Japanese.  At the end of the meal, you can pack anything but not Kimchi.  Hmmm..."}
{"text":"I dream about their kalguksu and dumplings, they are so delicious! I don't recommend ordering the shabu shabu since I don't think it's worth it and it's nothing spectacular. 
If you are to order anything, just order the kalguksu and have the dumplings to share since it comes with 6!

The kalguksu noodles are freshly made and you can taste the difference in its texture, although the broth is light, it's really flavourful.  The dumplings are really big  and juicy. I am drooling at the thought of them. The service is average, nothing impressive but not bad. They give you a clay pot full of kimichi for your meal and you get to refill your plate until your heart content. Their kimichi is better than most restaurants' banchan. Will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"The food as always is impeccable. But what motivated me to write this review was my dining experience today.

Ordered the $8.99 soup noodle as usual. Finished in around 15 minutes. Went to the cashier and left $11 on the counter. When I was on the way out, the cashier called me back for more tip. 

Never in my life have I been called back for more tip.

The $11 I paid already includes the tax and a 10 percent tip, but she insisted on more tip. In the end I didn't bother to argue and replaced the loonie with a toonie, which translates to a 20 percent tip.

Can't say I'm not going to go back, because the noodle and the broth is really legitimate. But given the many Korean food choices in the Yonge and Finch area, I probably wouldn't be back for a very long time."}
{"text":"Ginormous dumplings, awesome soup base and really delicious (spicy while sweet) kimchi. The menu here is small if you don't want to do the table top grill or hot pot options, but they are very good at what they do serve. Great for lunch as the price is around $10-15 per person, although you may need to order a few items are share to get variety."}
{"text":"We always go here when we are in the area. The big dumplings are always good, and sometimes you can even see the people hand making them. The Kalguksu is always good, most of the time we come here we always get Kalguksu and dumplings. The Shabu Shabu was great too, it was a little but small, bit we just asked for some beef and we got it"}

Extra information:

* Parking in the plaza

* Family friendly

You know those days where it's so grey and depressing all you want is just a bowl of hot noodle soup to warm you up? MyungDong KalGukSu is just the place for that.
Myung-Dong is a area in Korea where this type of noodle is very popular at, filled with shops for tourists and shoppers. KalGukSu is a type of noodle made with flour in hot soup, home-style and simple.

Served with kimchi in a stone pot, you take out how much you want to eat out on the plate. Kimchi that is served with MyungDong KalGukSu is meant to be quite spicy with lots of garlic. I love this type of kimchi with KalGukSu since the noodle itself isn't too strong on its own. How to get rid of major garlic breath after eating at MyungDon KalGukSu is something you need to figure out on your own..

Ordered: King Size Dumpling 5/5

* 6 large pork dumplings for $8.99
* Make sure you rip into the dumplings since it will come out piping hot
* Add some soy sauce to your likings and it's good to go
* It is nice to order as a side to share between 2 or more people

Ordered: MyungDong KalKukSu 3/5

* Noodles made in house, bowl of pork noodle soup for $7.99
* You can add some spicy peppers that are on the side for extra flavor
* Unlike Chinese beef noodle soup, the broth is lighter to drink
* I don't crave this often but when I do, it always hits the spot

Summary: MyungDong KalKukSu is a nice place to drop by if you want a bowl of hot Korean noodle soup. They also serve Shabu-Shabu (Korean hotpot) as well so check it out!"}
{"text":"average food and  Bad services, most of the time, korean restaurant has some nicer service but this one is one of the worst."}
{"text":"You've got to try their soup (dumpling soup). It's just the best. The focus here isn't about excellent service or anything, but the place is clean and the food is great.

You can see them making their dumplings fresh from time to time. I like this place. It's a classic for me."}
{"text":"This place has THE best fresh kimchi in the GTA. Frankly, it may even be at the top of the best kimchi list in North America.  That being said I love tucking into their Kalkuksu and a pot of kimchi. It is truly heavenly with the generous garlic seasoning and crunchiness of the cabbage.  

I highly recommend this place for kimchi lovers. The menu caters to diners who want a no fuss meal to accompany the delicious kimchi.  Many yelpers may feel incredulous about this fact but it speaks to the type of restaurant Myungdong is.  

The king dumplings are good for meat lovers and for diners who feel they are bland, I would suggest trying them with the preserved chilies which are on the table.  

I have brought my many kimchi loving friends to Myungdong and by the end of the meal they are making plans to bring their loved ones for another visit. It is just that good.  

David Chang said it best, \"It is ugly delicious.\""}
{"text":"The dumplings soup is good.  The beef shabu shabu doesn't worth the price. The portion is so little and definitely not enough for 2 people.  The service is bad especially  the server that can speak both mandarin and korean has an attitude for diners that ask question about the menu. She makes you feel like idiot.  Overall experience is doesn't worth a second chance....."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the strip plaza where Wild Wings is on Bayview Ave.  I passed by this plaza very often but never noticed this place until my Korean co-worker told me about it.  The Dumplings were huge and tasty and the noodles were good.  Parking is easy to find in this plaza and the place itself is pretty clean.

{"text":"Saw this place for awhile now and been meaning to try it out. It's a good thing I decided to :)

Place is somewhat small and can get super busy at times. Maybe fits a total of 25-30 people at once? Waitresses are friendly and helpful. We ordered the spicy hot pot style Shabu Shabu and it tasted pretty decent. Got lots of veggies, some meat, seafood (mussels and shrimp) and some mochi filled taro and sweet cheese things that was in a peanut shape and chewy. We also got some sauces to dip the food in and a LOOOOVELY urn of kimchi goodness! In fact, the urn of kimchi was spicier than the hot pot but nonetheless still tasted wonderful.

There are not many items on the menu which keeps it simple and generally helps you remain directed. You either get noodle soup or the hot pot pretty much. There is however King dumplings offered here which I'd loooove to try! They look humongous and yummy! Would def return to give that a shot and also their noodle soups cuz who doesn't love korean noodles/ramen?!"}
{"text":"Dropped in late Thursday evening after a long day at work and no motivation to cook dinner at home. We didn't really think about the time and we're just happy there were tables available, as we've seen this place packed out the door on weekends. My family and I have been eyeing the place for its apparent popularity with lots of Korean people, and finally we were able to try. I'm not very familiar with Myungdong cuisine or Korean cuisine, and my spice tolerance is minimal compared to the stereotypical East Asian individual. With that, I came in really to see what the place is about and with no expectations at all. 

We were warmly greeted by a younger waitress that spoke English, and it appeared the other servers were avoiding us because they really couldn't communicate. She was great to give a few recommendations and explain the menu since it was our first visit, and we ended up going with a soup noodle bowl and an order of king dumplings. The menu is a quick four-pager with one page on single portion items, one page of double portion shabu items (think Korean hot pot), another page of larger group shabu sets, and a page for drinks. She quickly took our order and come back with the plates and bowls, and kindly explained what each one was for - super useful as she set out about 5 different plates and bowls that kind of all seemed to have interchangeable functionality.

The dumplings came out first and they looked like Cantonese shrimp and pork wontons but three-maybe four-times the size. They were piping hot and had pork, onions, and some other green mixed in. The skin was thin like a wonton, so it broke easily and got a bit messy, but was nonetheless tasty. These were thankfully completely not spicy, so we happily ate them without concern. As they cooled down it becomes apparent the pork texture is pretty rough, but they were still good dipped in soy sauce. The size of them made the order of 6 a generous portion. 

The soup noodle featured a ramen type of noodle with bits of pork shreds and onion. There was a bit of spicy oil added on top but still a tolerable level for us. The soup was tasty though on the salty side, and tasted to be a pork and veggie base. I thoroughly enjoyed the noodles' texture as they were chewy yet soft, and retained their texture the entire way through. The spice and the metal bowl kept the soup and noodle hot all throughout the meal, which suited my slow eating pace very well. There wasn't much else to the bowl, but I take it is a simple menu item given it came off the single portion page.

Overall the experience was positive and satisfying, as we sought a lighter dinner that would still be filling. There were aspects that encourage us to revisit, such as trying their shabu pots next time by coming in earlier, and coming back for the huge dumplings. Things leaned towards the saltier side, but I appreciated that things were not bland. The price was acceptable for a simple casual dinner, which matched the ambiance of the place. I'll be returning to try more menu items and update my review for sure."}
{"text":"Took my order wrong and no apologies. Seems they don't care your business if you don't speak Korean. Won't go again and sorry, 5-cent tips for that lady"}
{"text":"Best place for dduk mandoo gook and king dumplings. There is nothing in Toronto quite like their broth. Anytime I have a sick friend or family member, I always do take out of a bowl of dduk mandoo gook. Any sick person feels a lot better after having this broth. Esp alongside some super garlicky kimchi. 

The only side dish they have is their kimchi. It's not fermented, it's super fresh. It compliments the meal very well.

Their hot pots aren't worth it. The portions are super small. If you do order it though, at the end, you have an option to opt for hand pulled noodles or congee/ rice porridge. Definitely get the congee. So so sooooo good! 

Owner makes a lot of money with this establishment. You can tell. He's always wearing a Burberry or Lacoste polo and drives around in an Audi A7. His establishment does well, that's for sure. 

Downside to this restaurant, other than the lack of side dishes, they close everyday at 9pm sharp. Also, be prepared to have super stinky breath. The chives and garlic kimchi is not attractive. Bad to bring a first date here."}
{"text":"Well known for their king-sized dumplings, this small korean restaurant serves several traditional dishes that are difficult to find in other korean restaurants. Servers are friendly, many and quick to your service."}
{"text":"Went there since it's close to where i live, the dumplings are huge and good taste. Recommend for those are really hungry. We wanted to order beverages but all they have are Soft drinks( they have juices and others on menu which are all sold out) We also ordered spicy hotpot for two which is 15.99 for each, it looks beautiful and large amount on the menu when it comes we were surprised about the portion of the food., So little that we can still take a burger after all. Services are average, I asked for water they forgot, and we also asked extra order of meat they forgot too.. Overall I would give 3 stars for its dumplings lol"}
{"text":"Are you craving dumplings like I was today? Then definitely come pay this cute little local Korean restaurant a visit for their MASSIVE \"King dumplings\".

Looking for some sort of \"clean eats\" that was nice and hot and satisfying, I found myself drawn to the Yelp pictures and reviews of this place. I ordered a dumpling and rice cake in soup and it was everything I expected it to be - not oily, not too salty, piping hot, and 100% satisfying. It was a filling meal and when paired with their homemade kimchi, the balance of tangy spice and savoury broth was delicious.

I had no problem scarfing down all the food and it wasn't too expensive ($12 for my dumpling soup, $13 for the king dumplings alone). I'd be glad to come back another time when I'm craving it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for a late lunch. Delicious!! We ordered the king dumplings (6 giant dumplings for $8.99) and the spicy cold noodles ($8.99).

Complimentary bowl of kimchi before our dishes came. So much kimchi! The dumplings came first, and they were oh so delightful. The filling (i think it's pork) was juicy, and when you dip it in that soy sauce...ohhh man. The cold noodles came with the spice on the side. Not sure if it usually comes like this, or if it's because we asked for less spice. Delicious as well.

Would definitely recommend this place (and am already planning to come back to try their signature hot noodle dish which we saw that most of the others in the restaurant had ordered). Great service and great atmosphere.

Until next time!"}
{"text":"This is a very specialized small place - the best thing they serve are the king dumplings - delicious! Kimchi is wonderful and we like their noodle soup - broth light but very tasty with the fresh noodles."}
{"text":"Favourite Korean dumplings ever...! And the most garlicky & addictive kimchi. This place is always busy though it's tucked away in the deep suburbs of Richmond hill. Very limited menu.. so you know the they do them well. Let's just say... You will need those homemade mints at the end of the meal lol."}
{"text":"Menu is limited, but love their noodles and dumplings. And did I mention the fresh kimchi!!! Probably one of the restaurants with the best kimchi!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it first opened and over the years, this place has gotten busier and busier for good reason. The food here is wholesome, hearty, and delicious every single time. My family and I usually order the dumplings with rice cake and soup and we love the complimentary kimchi. The dumplings are huge and after eating one, I already feel so fulfilled but the great thing is, it comes with two more! And the soup...oh man...it looks like it's just there to keep the dumplings and rice cake moist but it packs a lot of flavor as well! I really enjoy the kimchi, however, it does make your breath very garlicky for quite a long time and the mint they serve at the end of the meal doesn't seem to do much, so just be aware of that if you are taking someone there for a date. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everything is little and small, especially the Hotpot. Not worth the price 20.99/per person. Taste is not bad, but I won't come again. Service is also bad, forgot some of our order but calculated in the bills. Not recommended. There are too many better choices of Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Best kimchi I've ever had. Dat homemade flavor. My friend just came back from korea 2 months ago and he agrees that the kimchi here trumps any he had there. Other yelpers have already pointed out the limited menu. These guys literally serve just 3 things. Shabu shabu (korean hotpot), GIANT steamed mandu (dumplings), knife-cut noodles. I always get the noodles and mandu whenever I come. The mandus are nice and plump and super filling.

Parking is not too bad in this plaza. The service is hit or miss here. The boss sits in front of the cash register and the waitresses all have uniforms. Some of them are really nice others are not so nice. Generally during peak hours they all get a lil cranky. If you don't care about service try this place out! They make pretty good food. All kimchi tastes pedestrian to me now after eating it at this place. They've ruined me haha."}
{"text":"Dumplings are good and they look and taste like home made. The skins of the dumplings are so soft and thin.. A plus!! Hates dumplings with thick skins. What I like most was the free kimchi .they gave each table a jar of kimchi. I am not a kimchi fan but I actually finished the whole jar. Cabbage is very soft and full of flavors but not too spicy .. Perfect for me. As for the hotpot (shabu shabu).. I do think it's a little over priced; they could have added more beef. They gave you noodles at the end so I was pretty full at the end. Don't forget the hotpot comes with 6 big dumplings too. The service was okay but didn't expect much. We came during Sunday lunch time when there was a line up..after we sat down they seemed to be rushing to take your order. Overall, the food was good. I will come again."}
{"text":"I discovered this place through Instagram. What drew me to this place is the King sized dumplings. 

I decided to go on a Saturday for dinner at around 7pm. The place had about 15-20 four seater tables and pretty busy. There were 3 groups in front of us and the wait was about 5mins. People ate pretty fast! 

Food: The menu was pretty limited, 4 soup and noodle options, King Dumplings, and a couple different options for Shabbu Shabbu. 
We ordered King dumplings and one Kalgooksoo for each of us. The food came out piping hot. The dumpling were good but just taste like a standard dumpling, nothing special. The Kalgooksoo was good though. The noodles are house made and had the perfect amount of chewiness to it. The broth was light complimented the noodles perfectly. The portions for both were huge! One order of dumplings comes with 6 and the noodle bowl looks like a medium sized metal mixing bowl lol. 

The service: The servers spoke limited English but we had no problem ordering, most likely because of the limited menu. After placing our order, we were served tea and kimchi. Our dumplings came out pretty quick, within 5 mins of ordering but the noodles took a little bit longer to come. 
Overall the service is like other typical Asian establishments with minimal interaction but I don't mind it lol."}
{"text":"9 pm hunger setting in, I knew it was time for dinner.  I drove to the first place that read NOODLE and dove in.  Apparently, their last call is 9 pm when I asked them afterwards.  I was greeted on my way in and out as well.  I was offered the bench seating along the walls where the tables here have installed induction ranges.

I got the Myungdong Kalkuksu(Handmade Noodle $7.99) and in a minute I was served Tea and Kimchi then the next minute the Noodles came.  I started taking photos as usual, little did I know it was the same place Jennifer K. got CAUGHT.

I was served Kimchi on a plate while the couples and families were given a small JAR to pull their Kimchi from.  Pure discrimination, they don't think I can finish a jar of Kimchi on my own?!?

The Noodle Bowl was metallic and huge as per most Noodles I've had at Korean places.  I still don't understand the TINY spoon thing which has no purpose, it's a stir-stick for your Tea if you wish.  Pick up the whole bowl and start sucking in the Soup.  The Noodles aren't that great but not the worst I've had.  It's hard to make me believe its handmade when the Noodle shape/size are all so uniform and consistent.

The Noodle has a small topping of BEEF pieces, Onion, Carrot, Chives, Cucumber.  I didn't think it would be a spicy item but either the boiling Soup got to me or it had some spice to it because I was feeling the heat.  By this time 9:30 pm, I was alone with 3 Korean women sweeping, chatting, mopping while the men seems to be stationed at the register most of the time or goes inside the kitchen.

I forgot my WALLET in my car so they let me go grab it.  It's probably the first time the woman heard of such thing as she was talking to me, having a laugh.  The other tables of Koreans were having Noodles as well while the family of Chinese had the Shabu Shabu too.

The DECOR has nice solid dark wood style tables and the walls were in the style of the once existent Tofu Village(RIP) in Markham.  Food photos line the wall that are shown on the menu as well.  I was about to try the Soy Milk Noodle but someone's review is actually affecting my choices unfortunately and it's totally my own fault.  I was looking for the Dumpling Noodle which Man Doo Hyang has but this place doesn't have it.  It's either Noodle or Dumplings, not both.  

Speaking of Man Doo Hyang, I much prefer the Noodles there than this place therefore the 2.5 *Stars* I give to this place because the 0.5 *Stars* is for the NY Yankees & T.O. Blue Jays game being shown on the LCD for people like me that have nothing else to do while waiting for my meal."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite spots! Not overly crowded and delicious food. The fresh kimchi is mouth-watering and the dumplings are huge! The menu is limited to noodles, dumplings and hot pot but its so delicious that it doesn't matter. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you're craving korean dumplings then you really don't need to look any further because Myungdong Kalguksu has got you covered. With such a simple menu, they excel in what they do: ALL daily-made dumplings, noodles, and perhaps one of the best pot kimchi around. But that's all you need!

You start off with kimchi in a cold, clay pot: it looks thick and rich with all that redness and garlic radiating. It isn't for the weak: It's spicy, it's bold, it's crunchy, this is some amazing kimchi. The garlic might be overpowering for some (we could still taste it the morning after!) but more garlic is always a blessing of extra flavour. 

Next comes the six large steamed mandu with heat and steam emitting from them. They're perfect dumplings. The skin perfectly encloses the large amount of filling and holds it quite well. It has a nice light chew to it and is neither too thick nor thin. The filling is magnificent as not what you would expect of a chinese or japanese dumpling. The ground pork filling is looser yet is incredibly moist and the chives and shallots were refreshing. Six dumplings was surprisingly enough and we were plenty full sharing three each. On the side of the table there was a sweet and sour vinegar, chili peppers, coarse salt, and some chili powder. The vinegar provided a pleasant sweetness and eaten together with the kimchi was delightful. 

Lastly we ordered the spicy guksu noodles which were absolutely spicy! Do not order this if you can't handle spice. The noodles were amazing and again, had the perfect amount of chewiness and bite. They were sitting in the spicy sauce and were served with spring mix greens and a half a boiled egg on the top. 

Service was efficient and seamless, and the value was excellent. On a day where you don't want anything heavy or greasy, these king sized dumplings deserved a king sized thumbs up."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go because they have magnificent green pickled chillis as part of their condiments tray. I have asked the boss to sell the chillis to me, to no avail. (Boss, if you are reading this, please reconsider!!)

I usually order the giant dumplings and my kids enjoy the hot noodle soup. Dumpling skins are thin but hold their contents well. Each dumpling is packed with a ground meat & veggie filling. The noodle soup broth is tasty but the bowl only has thin slivers of julienne vegetables and bits of ground meat, not great value for money compared to the dumplings. The menu says their dumplings are made fresh every morning ~ I believe it!

Business is brisk, patrons generally eat fast and leave. May have a line-up at the door during peak dining hours. Service is typical of Korean restaurants, waitresses speak English but are more fluent in Korean. So it's really those chillis that keep me coming back ;-)"}
{"text":"This place has been in my bookmarks for a while now and finally, FINALLY !!! I had the time to give it a try on Friday. 

First off menu wise, it was VERY small. Like very. I was expecting there to be like a couple of different types of Kalguksu to choose from, but nah. There were really only like two. However, there were a lot more shabu shabu options to choose from than compared to the kalguksu. 

What did I order?
I got the regular noodles and the king-sized dumplings. Tbh I only came here to try the dumplings AND I was pretty fking upset. The noodles were okay, but for $8.99 or $9.99 (I don't remember), there were ONLY noodles and like pea-sized amounts of little garnishes. They could've added in like half an egg or SOMETHINGG. AND THE DUMPLINGS. YEAH THEY HUGE YEAH THEY ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU FULL, but jeez I actually REALLY hated the taste. I'm not entirely sure what they are called, chives ?! ( gau choy? gow choy?!!) There was SO MUCH OF IT LIKE WHY?!  Personally, I think the dumplings would've been fine WITHOUT THE USAGE OF CHIVES BUT THATS JUST ME. I had one dumpling and I wanted to call it a day, but of course, because I ordered it, I had to tackle this hell of a challenge. (Good news, I think my sister ate the last two :') Tears of joys my maties.) One good thing about the dumpling was the skin. I really liked the skin. Honestly, I just wanted to throw out the meat and eat the skin. MMmmMMMmm 

Banchans:
This place is probably the FIRST korean restaurant that I have been to that doesn't give you free side dishes and honestly speaking, I'm not too happy about that. They DID give us this pot of kimchi which WAS pretty good. BUT!! BUT!! GARLIC OVERLOADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

!!! !! iM NOT A HUGE FAN OF GARLIC AND WOW JUST I CANT. DONT YOU GUYS JUST HATE THE AFTERTASTE AND THE LINGERING TASTE OF GOD DAMN GARLIc DEAR GOD  ITS tHE DAY AFTER I ATE IT AND THE LINGERING TASTE IS STILL JUST AS STRONG .. HEP ME 

So anyways, it's generally an okay place. If you guys can get over the hella garlicky kimchi they give you, the under-garnished noodles, the monstrous dumplings taken over by chives, the small menu options, and the fact that there are no banchans THEN BE MY GUEST AND EAT HERE BUT I KNOW FOR DAMN SURE, I'm probably gonna spend my money else well 

(and my journey to find the best dumplings live on ~~~~)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars
This place is known for their king sized dumplings and knife-cut noodles (kalguksu), so my friend and I ordered one of each. 

Their dumplings came in a group of six, and as the name suggests, they were gigantic. Each one was at least double or even triple the normal size. The skin was thin and the inside was stuffed w/ pork, onions, and chives. I found it to be pretty decent on its own, but eating it w/ the kimchi further enhances the flavor. 

As for the kalguksu, they were alright. I liked how the broth was light and not too oily, but the noodles itself was mediocre. It wasn't springy and didn't absorb the flavors of the broth. Also, it only came with a few garnishes so the cost wasn't worth it either. 

Perhaps the highlight of this meal was their pot of kimchi; it was a lot more garlicky than most other places, and I found myself craving for it here & there."}
{"text":"Started off with kimchi and since I don't any spicy food, I was told by my friends that this was excellent! Great - but they don't allow you to take the rest (unfinished portion) out! 
We ordered 3 things - 1 dumpling, and two bowls of noodles.
They were all very freshly made, hot, and juicy!  All the food was very, very well done with lots of \"stuffing\" and I would definitely come back for these next time around! It was moderately priced and fairly reasonable.
It would be great to try out the hop pot here though I think, judging by the presence of the hot plate on the table.
The decor is pretty unique, and their utensils are fairly quirky too (e.g. extra long spoons!)"}
{"text":"My all time favorite dumpling and noodle place to go to. Their kimchi has a unique taste to it compared to other places (has a nice sweet tangy taste). The dumplings are huge and it goes perfectly with a bowl of their noodles, topped with either the kimchi or their own special dumping sauce. If you find the noodles too spicy, you can ask them to separate the sauce and mix it to your own liking. 

I'm only taking a star off because this place is PACKED on weekends, so service is lacking."}
{"text":"I always come here for dinner, either with family or friends. The best dish I love is their Kim chi. Also the famous noodle. You won't be able to take any Kim chi home but this is authentic stuff. If your looking for a nice meal then this is the place to be except service is on the down side. Don't go here if you expect a quick meal. Love this place for the food only, the staff will give you face if you ask for more than water. The proportion are very filling and they always give mint candy in the end. Always room for improvement *service*"}
{"text":"Food: 2 syllables. 2 words. Kimchi. Dumplings
Review: 3 syllables. 1 wordAmazing

This is the go to hotspot for kimchi + dumplings. Their kimchi is straight up bomb. They use a mustard paste for it to get it that extra kick of fire. When you go here, I strongly recommend getting the large dumplings. The dumplings with their homemade soy sauce gets my tongue watering as I'm writing this review! I honestly wish this place was closer to Toronto as it would be my go to place for hangovers or a nice hearty meal with friends. Regardless, oh boy, this place is always busy and hustling whenever I go. Still, you will be able to get served quite fast. No place can compare to the kimchi here (I heard it was homemade? and not from the supermarket) and the servers were all very nice.

I went with a couple college friends are had a great time. The one problem that we had was that we couldn't get multiple bills and just one. Don't worry about parking as it's in a plaza with tons of room."}
{"text":"Ordered the dumplings shabu shabu which came with their signature king-sized dumplings (boiled), veggies and few slices of beef, kimchi on the side, and option of rice or noodles to end the meal. The beef was really soft & good. The dumplings are kind of bland.  Not a fan of the noodles - covered with flour, they make the whole pot of soup very thick/gooey and make everything else taste like flour. The noodles itself are very slimy, overall just not a good flavor & texture for me. 

There was a small fly constantly flying around during the meal. Service is not the best. The server came over at 9pm to tell us they close at 9:30pm - we were clearly still eating, so I wasn't sure if she wanted to kick us out right away. She stirred the pot a bit, then came back with the bill and I had to pay right away and was unable to finish the last bit of my meal (but I didn't like the noodles anyway). 

Overall a decent meal but I prefer other types of Korean food."}
{"text":"All the Koreans I know say it's hard to find authentic Korean restaurant. However this noodle house gets their grudging approval.

The noodles have a nice bounce when u chew into them. The broth itself is light and not too oily with a good amount of flavour. If you can't handle spicy food, don't even bother with the spicy option. Your tongue will be deaded.

The kimchi is the star of the show. Not only is it free, but it taste damn good.  That shit so good you wanna take some home...except your not allowed. Have to go mission impossible on that shit.

the thing that kills me is that their super large dumplings have gotten smaller over the years. Couple what with crap service and well that's all she wrote."}
{"text":"Got the dumpling combo shabu shabu for two, and noodles. Kimchi was fresh and dumplings were great, and really filling. Noodles were bouncy and delicious."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service. My mom and I were standing by the door for 10 minutes waiting for someone to seat us when there were two tables available. We were trying to catch the servers attention but they would just look at us and look away until we finally walked over to one and told her we were waiting for a table. At this point I was very annoyed.

We both ordered manduguk (dumpling soup) which came out fast and tasted great. After we finished, we ordered a set of dumplings for take out and paid for the bill. It was taking a while for the dumplings to come out so we called down a server to see if it was ready and they finally brought it out. When we were getting up to leave, the server was questioning whether we paid or not and we told her we did. With hesitation, the server quickly walked over to the counter to check with the man dealing with the bills. They clearly don't know how to serve or manage this restaurant. If anything, she should have checked at the front to make sure everything was paid for before giving us the dumplings, rather than questioning us if we paid or not. Very unprofessional and rude.

I'm not sure if I would go back after this experience because their service totally turned me off and this definitely wasn't their first time giving me crappy service, with this being the worst. They need to work on their management and teach their workers some manners."}
{"text":"I didn't seem to have a problem when it came to taking photos - but it was on my phone - so I guess that was the difference.

My friends and I came here on the Saturday.  They first gave us some delicious kimchi to start off with.  We decided to order everything that wasn't on the hot pot menu - so this includes 5 different dishes.  The names?  I have no idea.  King dumplings, soy bean noodle soup, a spicy cold noodle, soup with some king dumplings and rice cakes, and this other noodle dish that was absolutely delicious!

I definitely recommend the king sized dumplings and the last dish that I can't seem to identify.  Stay far away from the soy bean noodle soup... It's possibly the most bizarre thing you'll ever eat.

Nothing too special.  In total - with the 5 dishes, it was about $48 in total.  So definitely no complaints there!"}
{"text":"Anytime I am craving mandu aka Korean Dumplings, this is where I go. Their homemade dumplings are delicious and be prepared to be full as they are huge (there's a reason they call them King Dumplings). Nice thin dumpling skin with generous meat filling. I like to put a little of their homemade kimchi on the dumpling since it adds a slight sweet and spicy crunch to it. They also have kalguksu (aka knife cut noodles), and shabu shabu (hotpot). Usually when I come with my husband for lunch we order 1 mandu and 1 kulguksu and we are walking out stuffed.  I try to come early since the restaurant is usually pretty busy."}
{"text":"Seems this place is for shabu shabu but of the multiple times I've been here...I've yet to try it....cause i'm hooked on the spicy noodles, king sized dumplings and their homemade kimchi.  It always seems to be packed no matter what time of the day it is.  Will definitely return!  HOOKED!"}
{"text":"I came here one cold evening and ordered the Shabu Shabu and dumplings. While I enjoyed them both, I don't think I would be back - the Shabu Shabu, as others have noted, isn't really worth it. The dumplings are good. 

I should have listened to a friend and gone for the noodles. Perhaps next time if I ever come back :)"}
{"text":"This place has become a favourite of ours over the last two years. 

I find that simple menu makes it easy for me to decide what I want to order. 

Although they don't have the typical banchan, their kimchi is like one of the BEST I have eaten. 

This place is known for their GIANT steamed dumplings, but I'll tell you something, these aren't my favorite on the menu. 

 If you are dining in a smallish group (like 1 or 2 people) you want to order their dumpling in soup with rice cakes - this is my favorite, mostly because it gives you the 3 of the large dumplings with rice cakes in a beautiful pipping hot bone broth. 

The service is friendly enough and you will have a good experience. It isn't a super wow knock-your-socks off. But as everyday casual place, this place will hit that A+ all the time."}
{"text":"Love the jumbo dumplings here! $10.99 for 6 which seems like you need two orders to fill up but try one first because they're huge! I live the dumpling ricecake soup here. Two of my loves!  Consistent quality and good service makes this a long time favorite."}
{"text":"Limited menu, but that's all they need. This place kills it with their kimchi and dumplings, with a nice bowl of noodles to accompany your meal. Will definitely visit again!

RESTAURANT:
Located in a small plaza in the Thornhill area. Parking may be tough on weekends. Seating was comfortable and spacious.

FOOD:
- Giant beef dumplings with the perfect filling. I enjoyed it with their chili sauce which can be found on each table. 
- Their kimchi is outstanding as well - may be the best kimchi I've ever had.
- Noodles were hearty, hot and perfect to go with the meal. I enjoyed the soup.


SERVICE:
Standard"}
{"text":"I'm a huge dumplings fan - wontons, xiao long baos, mandus- you name it. They specialize in king mandu with ultra thin skin. The filling is loaded with minced meat and chives and they have the best kim chi in all of Toronto - they don't let you take left over kimchi home!  I also order kalguksu and its broth is delicious, very earthy with shitaki flavors."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt one of the best restaurants in GTA. The service is great and the food quality is authentic."}
{"text":"Dumplings and noodles are one of my biggest weaknesses....much like crack to a heroin addict, I absolutely can't say no to dumplings and noodles.  Trying to go low carb??  F*ck it!!  Not when there's dumplings and noodles around!

Myungdong Kalguksu is a local authentic Korean dumpling, noodle and hot pot joint that serves some fantastic Korean fare that I've been wanting to try for a while now.

The menu is small but everything they serve is fantastic and homely.  The Giant Korean Dumplings (Wang Mandu) are large thin skinned steamed dumplings stuffed with a wonderful ground pork and chive filling.  An order comes in a set of six which in itself is enough as a meal for one. 

The Kalguksu is a delicious knife cut wheat noodle in a flavorful beef broth along with pieces of ground meat and veggies.  

To top it off they give you a big container of the most garlic intense home made kimchi that is made daily.  Do not and I repeat do not go to an important date or meeting after you eat the kimchi as your breath will reek of garlic despite a ton of breath mints!

Service is very efficient and the food comes out quickly.  Price wise everything is reasonable as entrees are about $10 and hot pots are about $20.  Definitely a great place to satisfy my dumpling and noodle weakness.

4/5.  Great job!"}
{"text":"We tried it out on the recommendation of a friend. We go the king dumplings and kalkuksu noodles.  It's a different kind of Korean cuisine, apart from the regular soondobu stew, pork bone soup, and bbq.  It was flavourful.. but that's about it.  It's the kind of soup you can have on a warm day and won't be overpowered by sweat from the spice and sweat from the sun (if you know what I mean). 

Portion sizes were massive, we split a soup and an order of dumplings and were full and could still walk comfortably to the car.

The service was quick and attentive, looked like a lot of local frequent.  

Not sure if I'll go back, it's a bit of a ways for me to get there... However, I'm already craving that wonderfully-garlickly kimchi!"}
{"text":"Easy choice on a cold winter day, giant dumpling soup! Both the noodles and rice cake soup are very delicious and made fresh in house. Do not expect any service because the servers expect you to know Korean. You'd get a big jar of kimchi to eat with dumpling and noodles before your meal is served. I'm a big fan of the tea served in the restaurant. Most people come in mad eat the dumplings, hot pot seems good too, will try that next time."}
{"text":"Myungdong Kalkuksu Noobles and Shabu Shabu is a real find.  Personally this place has the best Korean mandu in town which alone is well worth the drive out from downtown.  Also the kalkuksu is excellent.  The kimchi is unbelievably garlicky but quite good as well--we always have to ask for more.  It can get very busy on the weekends for brunch so come by noon so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Small menu but good at what they do! Shared the noodles and dumplings with a friend and it was a good portion for the both of us. The dumplings were large, full of stuffing, and piping hot. Noodles were really springy and the broth was yummy. I particularly loved the pot of kimchi - it has a more garlicky kick to it!

Pretty busy on Sunday lunch but turnover is fast! Service is attentive and efficient. Their basic interiors are typical to your casual Asian eatery and there were quite a few multigenerational Korean families, which is always a good indicator."}
{"text":"Named after its signature dish, Myungdong Kalguksu tends to those to crave a nice warm noodle soup, especially this winter season. Despite their small selection, everything they make is fresh and delicious! If you like garlic, this place will be a match made in heaven for you.

Their noodle soup is essentially hand-cut noodles with some ground pork and vegetables. The soup is very clean and flavourful and they're meant to be paired with an order of their fist-sized dumplings (an order comes with 6). The two pair together really well, although if you're eating alone, it's a lot of food. You'll end up having to pack some dumplings home.

The kimchi though.... Oh. My. God. Try doing this the next time you go there: take a bite of the kimchi and drink the barley tea that comes with it. I don't know why, but it tastes SO good together. The spice, garlic, and barley tea just works... trust me on this.

I've tried everything but the cold noodle dish there, but rest assured I'll try that some time..."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are SO GOOD! Each order at about $9 is 6 giant dumplings that's so flavourful with leek, meat, and white pepper. The Myungdong Kalkuksu (hand cut noodles) for $8 were not bad, but tasted amazing with the BEST KIMCHI I have ever had, as well as the dressings they have at the side of table - all sorts of spicy chili and powder.

If nothing else, come here for the kimchi and dumplings. Worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings at this restaurant.  It's always packed with customers and service is pretty quick.  I highly suggest the soup with dumplings.  Each of the dumplings are massive and full of ingredients.

Service is a little bristly and they do not allow credit card splitting.  Also the menu is a little limited.  Basically they specialize in dumplings."}
{"text":"I just wish that this restaurant is closer to where I live ... Take my word, if you like dumplings, try it ! We were there like 1:00 pm and our food came out so fast !"}
{"text":"This is an update since my last visit more than 5 years ago!

Came here for lunch and ordered Shabu Shabu for 2 @$11.99 each. Portion though smallish if you are a big eater but everything was fresh and delicious.

Love the Jar of Kimchi which is super garlicky but quite addictive.

Service was efficient.

I will come back have some of those giant dumplings next time!"}
{"text":"After reading a few YELP reviews, I was hesitant coming here for the first time but I knew I had to try the dumplings and they were definitely a hit. 

The menu is limited but there's still something to get and the meal comes pretty quick. What I didn't like about the limited menu was that there wasn't much English description so I was left asking the waitress a bunch of questions. She definitely started giving me attitude (that I can brush off) after a while. I ended up getting the Myungdong special (forgot the name) and asked for no spice at all. Though the onions still came spicy, it was delicious and gave my broth a little kick.

As I was craving noodles and was really hungry, I considered eating the \"Serves two\" menu BY MYSELF however the waitress said that if I wanted to do that, I would have to pay the amount twice which disappointed me.

Overall I would come back for a quick meal if I have a random craving but it wouldn't be a usual spot for me.  For someone who doesn't eat much spicy food, maybe it wasn't the right place for me."}
{"text":"This is Korean style hotpot. We came in very later after a longer day trip and the restaurant was very hot and was almost full. and we got the last table. Nice people here and very enjoyed the dinner."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is its simplicity. Simple flavors, simple menu. Noodles, shabu shabu, and OH MY GOD THE BIGGEST SUMO WRESTLER DUMPLINGS IN THE WORLD. Myungdong Kalguksu is cozy Korean restaurant tucked away in a Dollarama plaza that isn't heavily populated with restaurants, so it's easy to overlook it on the road. But damn, this place is a must-try. ESPECIALLY THEIR KIMCHI HOLY!!! The yelpers do not l i e.

But despite my enthusiasm for the really good food, the service was absolutely terrible :( The servers seemed apathetic throughout all of service. I had to repeated ask them for tea, and sometimes they would forget about my request. And worst of all, they shoved the bill at us when we weren't even done eating! They told us that it was because the restaurant was getting busy and people were waiting, but still! I just wanted to eat my sumo dumplings the way I want ... When I went up to pay for the bill, the server came to my table and took away my unfinished food too! That's one dumpling I will never able to get back :'(

It's a tragedy that this restaurant lures me with their food and kimchi, but fails to deliver on the experience side.

Overall, if you can tolerate poor service, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"i came here couple of times... first time mainly because they have giant dumplings.

Then i fell in love with their noodles which taste exactly like instant noodles.. 

unfortunately the service from the korean ladies here who NEVER smile.. and unattentive service .. and expensive menu.. kills their rating.

its definitely pricey for what you get.  The cheapest noodle on the menu is 8 dollars and does not have any meat... litterally taste like a premium instant noodle.   

the manager is nice.. but overall  i leave here always wondering why i came here when there is phoenix next door...which is probably a fraction of the price with bigger portions to even take home."}
{"text":"I wasn't planning to go here for dinner on a weekday evening but I remember it was so busy during the weekend. So I decided to try it and it was very pleasant experience. 

The menu doesn't have many items. It has cold noodles soup with homemade soya bean milk,  hot noodle soup with group beef, zucchini and onion, and the giant dumplings with pork. We ordered  those 3 items. I noticed most customers in the restaurant ordered the same items as us. 

For side dishes, they served the homemade kim chi.  I didn't try them but my husband said they were very fresh and yummy. 

The giant dumplings came first and the skin were so thin and soft, the filing had ground pork and veggies and tasted so good.  Even they were big and came in 6 pieces, it didn't take us long to finish all because they were that good. 

The soya bean milk noodles totally blew my husband's mind. As the soya bean milk was homemade daily in the morning, it was a lot thicker than the chinese soya bean milk in the supermarket. I think it is probably the best cold noodles I've ever seen in Toronto. 

I also enjoyed my hot noodles too, but perhaps I shouldn't had too much of the soup as I felt a bit thirsty after. 

I like that they have their own specialty which are different than other korean restaurants. Most importantly, if their menu only has a few dishes , it is likely they are fresh as everyone order same items."}
{"text":"Agreed king size dumplings are delicious. And the kimchi here is amazing. You can ask for refill for the kimchi.

Also, enjoyed the shabu-shabu. Friend warned me first that the quantity is limited.. so I was not disappointed. Yumm... They gave us noodles at the end which we ate last with the remaining broth. Was very sticky and found it strangely good - I guess this is the filler."}
