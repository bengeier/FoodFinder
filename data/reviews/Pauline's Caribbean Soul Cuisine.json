{"text":"I was walking through north side on my lunch break. I stopped at the window front to look at their menu. A worker (possibly one of the owners?) was sitting outside and went in to grab me a full menu.  I went with the vegetarian patty. It was amazing. Customer service from everyone was  so so friendly. I tipped them the same price as my lunch and was more than proud to do so.  I can't wait to come back.... good food and nice people.   Support local business!  Delivery via grub hub  No minimum on cards"}
{"text":"So I stopped by tonight,  they had been quite busy and sold out of most of their menu items. They only had curried chicken and curried goat left. I got both. The food was absolutely delicious! I am excited to try more of their menu items. They also have a variety of fresh made juices. I tried the Cantaloupe Strawberry - it was very refreshing."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant today for the first time and I am SO glad I went. The oxtails with rice & peas and cabbage were delicious!!!!! I am in heaven right now. I cannot wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a good Jamaican spot in the burg!!!! The oxtail was on point and the homemade mango ginger drink was refreshing."}
