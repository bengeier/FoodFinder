{"text":"This place is great. Staff are nice. Big bench seating, good for a group. Food is delicious, great with kids.  The only problem is the coffee. It is the WORST COFFEE we've ever had at a restaurant. Please fix! Very watery.   Otherwise 4 out of 5 b/c we really like this place."}
{"text":"A great place to get a basic breakfast, but can take long and lineups are inevitable on weekend mornings. Nothing fancy, which can be great depending on what you're after. Waffles are pretty good and the hostess was super gracious and apologetic when we didn't get our extra helping of waffles we ordered. Come for the food, not for delight/surprise."}
{"text":"Convenient location from where we were staying--delicious food and HUGE portions. We came twice while we were in town and both times neither I nor my companion could finish! Simple food, but well cooked."}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast spots in town. Fresh ingredients and great food! Great place for groups and families. The service was phenomenal. Rachel is a great server; friendly, fast and attentive! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"been here 3-4 times and overall the food is above average. nice hearty omelettes but leaning towards pricey.  for the first time i noticed they give a 60+ senior's discount that made up for it.  that said they only get 3 stars - a side order of 3 sausages was $6!!!!!!!!! that is insane even with a discount. never would have ordered it had i realized the price.  *nota bene: on a return visit i read on the menu it is $6 for 5 sausages which is not a bad deal but it appears they shorted me 2 sausages the last visit.  also irksome - you need to use a spoon to serve yourself pepper. salt too. sorry that is just taking the rustic farm nonsense too far.   drinking water out of a mason jar and sitting on long benches is my limit."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Monday. Restaurant was as hot as a oven, when we asked if she had a.c. or a fan owner became extremely offended and gave us attitude. Food was mediocore at best, fruit tasted like it had been sitting on a counter for weeks and turned to mush. Better off getting McDonald's breakfast save your time and money!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, staffed by the friendly owners. The menu is full of affordable staples. Owners have full time jobs and run the place on weekends and holidays 8:00am - 2:00pm. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh, they're nice, and trying soooo hard, but I'm sorry to say our meal was very mediocre and rather overpriced.  I sincerely hope they can stay open long enough to get good"}
