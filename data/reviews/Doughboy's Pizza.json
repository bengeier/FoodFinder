{"text":"Tried it today for the first time, loved it! Had the lunch special and wings. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few slices after walking by with an empty stomach. They warmed up (not nearly enough) a few choice slices of cheese pizza, which were pleasant but forgettable. Doughier crust, which maybe was to be expected from the name."}
{"text":"We tried Doughboy's looking for a new pizza joint and....we regret every penny we spent here the wings were soggy and the crust of the pizza was so buttery my husband literally said the only good thing they had was ranch. We should have ordered papa johns honestly that would have been better then what we got  
will not return
will never recommend"}
{"text":"Top notch Pizza and hoagies.  Great white pizza!  Try a juggernaut, you will love it!  I have never had a bad meal.  From steak salads to wings, and pizza to hoagies, I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My younger brother was craving pizza and I agreed to pick one up for him before I went to work. We went, got the pizza and everything was fine. Put the pizza on the counter and opened the box. Two flies flew out of the box. I had to head to work otherwise I was going to be late so we just ordered chinese. He was really put off about the whole thing and called the manager who said he could make us another one. That was nice of him, but I couldn't go back to get him another one. We went back a few months later to try again and the pizza was really plain and we only ate a slice each before tossing it out. Really, not worth it. There is a Streets of New York pizza right behind this place. Go there, it is much better."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Ready in 15 minutes.  Crisp crust, awesome flavor on the meat lovers.  And the cinna pie was good too."}
{"text":"This place has some great tasting pizza, at a very reasonable price...The best thing is, they make it just the way we like it....light sauce and well done. GREAT JOB DOUGHBOYS...we will continue to patronize your establishment."}
{"text":"the best pizza. fresh great sauce. hot  when delivered try it . bellisimo.white pizza  is tasty with fresh tomatoes and  good garlic flavor. hoagies  fresh , hot   great"}
{"text":"Simply delicious pizza. House made Dough for the pizza is chewy and crispy, and the sauce is flavorful, not over powering.. Alway hot out of the oven. Fast and friendly people at the counter and on the phone.  We will be revisiting often."}
{"text":"Order often but honestly... WIPE DOWN THE DOOR. It is so off-putting... the handle, the frame, the knob... it is SO dirty. It is covered in SOOT fingerprints. Cleaning this FIRST IMPRESSION should be a part of closing and opening prep. It takes a single Clorox Wipe a night. This alone makes me downgrade a 5 star pizza to 3, because I cannot get over it. I cannot tell you how many people comment on the dirty front door and said they can't bring themselves to order again. Such an easy fix and I don't understand how it isn't a daily priority."}
{"text":"We have had some decent pizza from this place in the past. The problem is not with the food but with the employees and management. We ordered a couple pizzas tonight which they stated would be delivered in 45 minutes tops. An hour later they showed up. No big deal, its Friday night, they might've been busy. I checked the pizzas before the driver left just to make sure they were correct. I'm glad I did because they had been flipped upside down presumably en route. The driver ended up taking them back. I called the management, they offered to deliver new pizzas. Now an hour and half after making the initial call I finally receive my pizzas. The moral of this story is, this company needs to invest in a pizza rack for their delivery drivers. I'm sure a hard corner or quick stop slid these pizzas from the seat to the floor of the delivery driver's car and he just picked them up and acted as nothing happened. I will be contacting the owner next business day."}
{"text":"I completely agree w/ John D. I am from
Out of town, but I have eaten my fair share of pizza in the west valley over the past 5 yrs & this place \"Sucks\"!
Horrible food, horrible service. They messed up my ordered & did nothing to fix the problem. Sauce & toppings were not good. Avoid this place at all cost...."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place in our house. Awesome pizza and my husband swears by their hoagies! We love their turkey hoagies. Pizza is always great. Super friendly, love the fact we can order and pay online. Super convenient!"}
{"text":"We ordered 40pizzas for a school family night. Two deliveries of 20 pizzas each so everyone would be served hot pizza. The pizzas arrived hot and on time. The delivery driver was friendly. Ryan was very easy to work with. And the best part of all....Everyone loved the pizza. The dough is great, like fresh bread out of the oven. The sauce, cheese and pepperoni tasted great too.
Thanks Doughbys!"}
{"text":"Hoagies are hands down THE BEST YOU WILL EVER EAT! My favorite is the Italian. No other pizza shop can touch doughboys hoagies. Would have given 5 stars but the pizza is a hit or miss and they don't have homemade ranch. I've had excellent dough and terribly hard dough as well. I stick with the hoagies at doughboys."}
{"text":"The food is ok, nothing very special.  It would be worth at least a three or four star rating if they were able to take orders consistently without mistakes and then acting like jerks about it.  As it stands, I will avoid them, plenty of other mediocre pizza places around."}
{"text":"so yummy!!! I love there pizza and wings. Definitely nice to have when I don't feel like leaving the house but want something that will really satisfy my cravings"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Doughboys pizza! I prefer it over any other pizza take out! The staff is always so friendly and kind! Also very polite in person and over the phone! The pizza has awesome flavor! They have the $5 medium pepperoni pizzas too! It's a really good deal for really good pizza! Breadsticks are good too! I order pizza from here very often!=]"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and they were there to please you. I didn't hear employee drama or goofing off. Quick friendly service and pizza that is good1 My friend ordered a hoagie and was told ten minutes AND ten minutes it was. Give it a try if your into pizza and hoagies. They also do single slices."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be brutly honest.  The pizza is average and nothing special,  the wings arell also average. I don't see the big hype in this place cause the pizza just taste like an average pizza place and I know my pizza."}
{"text":"Always fresh tasting, flavorful and hot pizza. For $5 you can't beat this deal with a stick, it IS that good! Their customer service is top-notch and make you feel welcome in their little storefront. Great food, great people and definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great service.    Placed a large order online.   Order was ready as expected and great service.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"wow!  great pizza!  i work in avalon and there's plenty of mediocre pizza in the boroughs..doughboys is by far fantastic!  was well worth the wait and pizza was delicious and arrived piping hot even after traveling all the way to avalon..i was pleasantly surprised at the amount of cheese and toppings!  you gotta try this pizza!!"}
{"text":"When we moved here. I used to order from another Pizza place. 
My position for work changed. So, the staff at my job started ordering from Doughboys...it was like night to day!
We usually order the same things. My husband only likes the regular pizzas and hoagies. We order the same sandwiches, at least once a week.
Once out of 15 times, we ordered. There was a new person that took my order. He messed it up. I called back to report how it was. They gave me a $10.00 credit for the next time I'd order. 
They have your good to you got and delicious!"}
{"text":"Delivery takes entirely too long for just a Pie I live down the street and it takes a hour and a half to get my pie delivered to me that's insane"}
{"text":"Grab & go? Paid for then stood around ten minutes waiting for a dark brown, crunchy crusted pie that was about 30 seconds from being burned. Good quantity of ingredients though. I'll probably give them another shot."}
{"text":"I used to love this place ! Recently not so much yesterday I ordered a pizza and zucchini planks. The pizza looked like it had been dropped upside down all the cheese had fallen off. The zucchini was soggy. I never had a bad experience here u too now but I won't be ordering again after being so dissatisfied ."}
{"text":"We love the pizza and the prices at Doughboy's Pizza.  The Manager is almost always there and treats everyone there like family.  The ingredients are really good and...MAN... The Sauce!!!  It's awesome.  I usually go in and take it home.  It never has taken me over 15 minutes for any Pizza.  My neighbors tell me that when you get delivery that they have never waited more than 30 minutes.  We highly recommend Doughboy's Pizza.  Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ordered a Sicilian pizza tonight...which Ive never been real big on..I must say we loved it! I don't know why but the sauce and crispy crust hits the spot...we have ordered regular round pizza before...just ok...also the white pizza is better than a lot of other places.."}
{"text":"Just had the Juggernaut.. . finally. My awesome brother n law loves this sandwich and always orders it. 

The sandwich was packed with all fresh ingredients and was very tasty.  Its like a top of the line italian hoagie but without the salami etc.)  The \"Shanz Sauce\"  intrigued me and wondered what that was all about but I couldn't really taste it.  That was disappointing.   I could not help but to wonder if the sandwich would have been even better with regular mayo?  Like regular hellmans.."}
{"text":"Great texture, fresh ingredients.  We've had a couple pizzas from these guys so far and been happy each time.  The pizza tastes much better than the usual chains and the staff were willing to custom make what the kids wanted."}
{"text":"I still order just the one thing and its still fantastic. Price has increased slightly but this is the real deal. Best pizza in the city. Awesome prices, huge portions, tastes great and more filling!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large white pizza. No tomato. Added pepperoni, sausage, onion, bell pepper and extra cheese. I'm not a big sauce fan. 

The pizza was great. But the guy running the shop coulda been a bit nicer. Went to counter and heard what do you want. I've never been to this place and was kinda taken back. Maybe just a few manners and I coulda given it 5 stars. 

I would recomend"}
{"text":"Doughboy's is easily the best pizza place that delivers in the West End.  I started ordering here just because of the glorious online ordering, and now they deliver to my place at least 3 times a week.
The pizza is a little different than the norm.  It's a little thicker, with lots of cheese and heavy toppings.  However, aside from occasionally getting smothered in toppings, I have no complaints about the pizza.  Bonus points for using real bacon.
The sandwiches and wings here are also very good.  Nothing particularly stands out, but nothing has ever been bad either.
Honestly, my biggest beef is that they're closed on Sunday, AKA National Hangover Day, which is a crime against hungover humanity."}
{"text":"Horrible service- I work at a large facility and we spend a lot of money ordering from Doughboys. When you place an online order they say in the ordering platform- (Allow 60 minutes). That means to me as a consumer that your order will be delivered within 60 minutes not over 100 minutes. Called twice to check on the status of the driver and was told both times that he/she is on the road, where is he/she, on the other side of the City. At the time of writing this, I still don't have my order and we're going on over 100 minutes now.  When I commented on the (Allow 60 minutes claim in their ordering platform) to the phone rep, he argued with me and told me \"that is absolutely not true) when I am staring at their ordering system and it says (allow 60 minutes ). I don't appreciate being told that I am a liar and don;t appreciate an employee arguing with me on the phone when we are giving you business."}
{"text":"Very good. 15 minutes on time like they said. The cheese wheel is good and it's also very big not small like something you would get at pizza hut. The cinna pie is very good as well. The menu is  affordable. The food was nice and hot when we got it and everything tasted very good. The service was also friendly. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"***Update***

So they've done nothing to remedy the forgetfulness. I ordered and mayo and ranch was missing so they just gained $1.50. I've also been waiting for 1 hour and 40 minutes for my food. Probably a terrible Friday night pick.


Still the same amazing food BUT the service is lacking. The last 3 times I've ordered they've forgot things or given me wrong items. It's especially annoying when you order ranch at .75 and they don't include it. You're better off picking your food up."}
{"text":"I would have to say that I'm disappointed. After reading the reviews on this site I was expecting it to be awesome. Unfortunately that's not really the case. Its super greasy and the sauce taste cheap. It honestly taste like a slightly upgraded version of Little Caesars or pizza patron. It's a great price at $5 per a medium pizza, but even that's not enough to make me go back sorry guys, no good :-("}
{"text":"Delicious!  Really friendly staff and excellent oysters and sushi!  You can't beat the happy hour specials on the oysters.  We will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"We just got 3 grab and go pizzas, $5 each, they were very YUMMY.  The service is top notch, very nice on the phone.  I will be going there again and again!"}
{"text":"One of our three favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh. Definitely have to give these guys a try if you haven't tried their pizza yet. Sometimes the weight can be a little long, but this is a good sign. It can be expected when you find a pizza shop that makes excellent pizza that is in demand."}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza from here yesterday and it was Good. The only problem was it was around Dinner time and Friday Night so they were Very Busy.  

From the time I placed the order to the time of Delivery was over an HOUR. 

May order from here again but Not on a Friday Night."}
{"text":"The Italian hoagie is the best you will EVER eat. They put a combination of mayo and dressing on it. It just melts in your mouth! Any new area that I go to I always try an Italian hoagie and no other hoagie comes close to Doughboy's Italian hoagie!

The buffalo ranch fries are also the best fries I have ever tasted. I've tried buffalo fries from other places and they are laughable in comparison. 

This place is hands down a wicked delicious restaurant. One of the best pizza places."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings the kids loved it too no toy needed I will definitely be returning for more of that amazing perfectly crispy yet doughy pizza mmm"}
{"text":"I was very excited to order from a place called Doughboys. We got a medium pepperoni pizza delivered. They said it would take an hour but in came within 35 minutes. The pizza was hot and not soggy at all. The crust was incredible and puffy, sauce was alright and pepperoni a at flavor. Yum!"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, and affordable!!  I wouldn't go anywhere else after tasting this pizza!  The dough is fresh made, not frozen, and the wings are tasty too!  The staff is always nice and helpful PLUS the place is soooo clean!  My family LOVES Doughboys!!"}
{"text":"Its so good!  We got the supreme equivalent and the veggies lost a lot of water and made the center very soggy.  Despite this, we enjoyed the pizza very much - the crust is crisp and chewy, there's just the right amount of sauce that doesn't taste weird, and there is plenty of cheese and topping.  This would definitely be our go to pizza place if it was near our house.  Next time we'll probably go with just dryer veggies like mushroom or olive.  Other than that, its non-fou-fou, non organic, straight up old school pizza for movie night."}
{"text":"Ordered some take out from there recently. A whole hot sausage hoagie. It was actually twelve inches, unlike some other area restaurant hoagies. Absolutely delicious. I had a \"small\" meatball calzone. It was ridiculously big, and I could only eat half of it.
It too was really good. Fresh dough, meat balls, cheeses, sauce, etc. $25.00 total for the two items, but easily enough food for 4 meals."}
{"text":"Wednesday night I had a HUGE craving for pizza and was extremely tired of getting Pizza Hut , I wanted something more like Real pizza would taste like. After spending hours on yelp & google maps looking for a close enough pizza place I finally decided on Doughboys and I enjoyed everything of it . Customer service was average , but the pizza and the price can't be beat . I got the Special with and XL 1 topping pizza with 20 wings ( I got the buffalo ) for around $25 with tax , done within about 15 mins from ordering over the phone , sitting in the car I just couldn't wait , I had a wing & I was in heaven , so meaty , and far from dry and skinny like most other pizza places . As for the pizza I did wait to get home to eat , definitely saved the best for last , pepperoni and cheese pizza heaven"}
{"text":"Pizza has fresh basil and spices on top. Better than any big joints out there. Not much to sit but it is definitely worth way more than the price! 

Best pizza I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but I saw the same thing where the guy making pizza did not wash his hands after handling money and the phone. No more. too bad too."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of nights ago to pick up a pizza with my fiance after it was recommended to me by a coworker.  Said coworker explained to me that I could order online and I was impressed with the ease to place an online order.  I ended up ordering a plain 18\" XL inch cheese pizza to go which the website said would be ready for pickup in 30 minutes.  I arrived at the restaurant just after the 30 minutes and was told that it would be another 2 minutes.  It took 5 minutes which gave me some time to look around the place which seemed to be decorated with photos of the owner and his family.  There were a ton of them and they kept me busy for almost the whole time that I was waiting.  I also noticed that while I was waiting a customer came in to return his pizza and get a new one.  While I couldn't hear what was being said I did notice that the bottom looked a little burnt and also heard the end of the conversation where the man was dissatisfied after the owner explained to him \"that is how we do it here\".  After I arrived home with the pizza I eagerly dug into it.  The first thing that I noticed was the more than ample amount of cheese on the pizza which also tasted very good.  It helped to cover up the fact that the sauce was a little less viscous than I would have liked and lacked much flavor.  Finally the crust had an odd chewy texture to it which while I did not dislike it, I did not actively like it either.  Since the pizza was quite large we ended up with some leftovers and I think that I liked the pizza better cold as the crust had a different texture.

The bottom line for me is that I would not line up to head back here in the future but I would be going along with someone else if they wanted to.  My favorite part of the pizza was the cheese and how much was on it, now if they could only get a nicer crust and a thicker sauce."}
{"text":"I've only had their food delivered, but it has always been good! When I volunteer near-by we often call for delivery, I've had subs, pizza and salad. The white pizza was delicious!

Tip - the pizzas are HUGE and filling. I almost always over-order, even when I think I'm not ordering enough.

The delivery has been pretty reliable, I just suggest calling as early as possible and asking for a specific delivery time, rather than waiting until close to lunch time."}
{"text":"Dude this pizza is the best love the hot sausage... And the honey mustard wings are to die for.... The family special is what I always get: 1 large pizza, 2 one whole hoagie, 3 a dozen of wings, 4 a two liter of pop ... My favorite... Keep up the good work... hometown boys..."}
{"text":"Doughboy's makes a very good pizza. Not a great pizza but very good. When you add their prices into the pizza equation it brings them to the top of the list. 

The first time we ordered, we went for take out. Not a clue what their pricing was like. After placing the order and hearing the total I figured we in for a really crappy pizza night. Got the pizza home and dug in and were pleasantly surprised. Good flavor, good crust, toppings were tasty, since then we've been back probably a half dozen times and have never been disappointed. 

A little tip, they have a pretty good lunch special. 2 slices of cheese or pepperoni and can of soda for $3.50. Can't beat that..."}
{"text":"We order from here once or twice a month (if not more) from work.  Their pizza is always great, especially the CBR and so are the wings.

The only down fall is the garlic parm wings.  Unless you like a lot of parm on your wings, there is a bit too much for our taste....and smell.

Overall though, it's two thumbs up!

I had to add this update.  Yesterday, I ordered a \"small\" Hawaiian calzone for lunch.  Holy Cow!  I wouldn't want to see a large one!  Not complaining by any means, but it will feed a few.  It was as big as the box, about 12\" x 12\" and yes, it was really tasty!  I was definitely able to share with the guys.  

One thing about Doughboy's, you don't only get quality, but you get a lot of tasty quality for the money!  :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings! The cinnapie is delicious as well. I like the wings because they are baked. I drive over here from Goodyear. I wish they had one on my side of town!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Burgh hands down! Friendly service and fast delivery to many locations!"}
{"text":"It's my first time trying Doughboy's Pizza after hearing how good it is I had to give it a try and they were right its some of the best pizza I have ever had.  It has a authentic taste and everything taste fresh its different from Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  I will be back whenever I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with Doughboys until today.. It's a Tuesday night and I've been waiting for my delivery order for 2 whole hours!!! I called to get the progress of my order an hour ago and the woman who answered the phone told me my order already left!! Oh wow my order just arrived and its ice cold!!! Never Again!! Don't order here people!"}
{"text":"Love this place! $5.00 one topping pizzas ready in about 15 mins. Blows Little Caesars crap right out of the water! This is my go to pizza spot for sure. I recently suggested that my office coworkers pitch in for a few pizzas and give it a try, they are addicted as well!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of another pizza company in the local area since I was a kid. Buy since my sister took me here I changed my mind. This pizza was amazing. Great dough and fluffy crust. I was so good I went back two days later and got another pie. The staff was nice any helpful too. I was uninformed of the special and they ensured I didn't over pay and got the best deal for the wife and I. That shows integrity so you have made a new customer."}
{"text":"Now our 'go-to' place for pizza. I haven't had their sandwiches yet, because the pizza offerings are so well made and at reasonable prices. I'm a fan of their Sicilian option, but thick or thin, I think this is the best pizza in the Kennedy and Stowe region. Definitely worth a trip here."}
{"text":"3 stars? or 4 stars? but def. not a 5 stars.
Nothing special about this place.
Maybe my expectation was too high from reviewing the reviews.
But the pizza that i got was nothing special."}
{"text":"Glad I stopped here and picked up my pizza. This place was very clean and the staff was helpful and friendly. I received my pizza quickly and it was beautifully made. Took some time to get home and the pizza was still hot and the cheese was perfectly melted. The crust was the right thickness and had the perfect crunch. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I definitely miss your pizza, because it was my #1 favorite in the Burgh.  I've been meaning to see if you delivered to downtown Pittsburgh.  You'll certainly be my #1 pizza."}
{"text":"Look, it's Mckees Rocks.  I am happy to see any non-industrial business thrive in this town.

When someone mentions that a place has the best pizza around (which seems to occur more times than I can count) I'm game to try it out for myself.

Surprisingly,  for has many pizza slices I have inhaled in my lifetime, I can't recall ever labeling any particular pizza place with the best pizza around.  There was one place in New York City that came close,  but it is out of business due to the retirement of its owner.

Let's just say Doughboy's has great tasting pizza.  Very fresh due to the amount of business it generates . 

The shop is full of character, starting  with the seasoned employees, the various walks of life who stop in for their \"regular \" pizza by the slice order.

Take out only.  There is a small picnic table out front ,where you are bound to see a few of the locals enjoying their daily nourishment."}
{"text":"After living in Brighton Heights for 3 years, I've heard so many people sing the praises of Doughboy's and last night I finally tried a cheese pizza from them. 

I was SO disappointed! Let's start with the good - 
The sauce was great. I have to give them that. The sauce had great flavor and I really enjoyed it. But that's all I enjoyed. 

The pizza arrived with this like, thin sheet of plastic over the cheese? Maybe it was there to keep the cheese from sliding all over the pizza during the car ride? But it ended up making the cheese taste funny. It locked moisture into the pizza, which made little moisture bubbles form and it was SO GROSS. The whole pizza was just soggy and horrible. I like the cheese on my pizza to be a tiny bit brown, showing where the cheese bubbled a bit in the oven. This cheese was all white and had the moisture bubbles and it just locked in the sogginess more. It just looked unappetizing and after giving it a fair shake, it absolutely was. 

I'm sure the fluffy crust was good, but i couldn't get over how bad the pizza was to even enjoy that. So disappointed in this local staple. What am I missing here? Why was this SO SO bad??"}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty amazing actually. We went out of our way to try this place due to the great things we'd heard and we were definitely impressed. Their prices were pretty decent and the pie was amazing. Definitely in my top ten ever. (maybe I should start a list...)

I really wish they had more space for tables. I was disappointed that the only plausible place to sit was outside, but I understand t hat this place specializes in takeout and delivery...it's just that I live over 20 miles away so delivery is not an option for me. 

But yeah, $5 medium one toppings that aren't Little Caesars? That demands some consideration.

Try them!"}
{"text":"Gee...comes up on a search for 24 hour food...but close at 12\"45am on a Saturday.  Yippee."}
{"text":"We have always ordered pizza from doughboys but after today, we will Think twice before going back. I always do carry out and today went in to pick up our order and the cashier who took my money, was also taking phone orders, no big deal right? Well that was until he gave me my change and went and started making pizzas WITHOUT washing his hands. He grabbed two hands full of cheese and put in a cup, poured it on the pizza then grabbed sausage and pepperoni and spread all over the same pizza. Then he came back up answered the phone and took another order touching the computer and phone then went back to making pizzas again! The phone rang again and the manager on duty came up answered the phone touched the computer and he too went back to touching food without washing his hands or putting on gloves! I then asked for my $$ back for my 3 pizzas and breadsticks and even after giving me my $$, he still went back to making pizzas without washing his hands. Neither one even cared or said they were sorry! They were very busy but that is no excuse for what I saw tonight! Please take caution when thinking about getting pizza from here!"}
{"text":"I wish y'all would deliver to dormont. I had the pleasure of trying the \"juggarnaut\" about 2 years ago and your wings. Both of which were very delicious! I would be happy to order from y'all if yall delivered to dormont."}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes they are well worth it!  A real good quality pie, at reasonable prices!  What more can one ask for???  Well for me, eatable wings!!!  Their wings were baked, but seemed almost microwaved!  I've never had in my 32 years on this earth worse wings then the ones from Doughboy's.  I will certainly keep going back for their pizza, but wish their baked wings would never see the light of day again!!!"}
{"text":"We had seen the storefront, then checked them out on here.  Wow, they had 4 1/2 stars!  So, we decided to order for our football watching pleasure.

The pizza was not good.  It is sooo heavy!!  I can still feel the one slice I ate sitting in my stomach...almost 10 hours ago.  The crust/dough had no flavor, the cheese was incredibly greasy (not in a good way) and each small slice felt like it weighed 5 lbs.  Not enjoyable at all.  Let me put it this way, there is almost an entire pizza still sitting in our fridge (probably going to be thrown away), and if you knew my hubby, that never happens.  There's usually barely a slice for me to enjoy the next day.

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars...the BBQ wings were very good and the ranch was good.

Very disappointed, because we were really expecting a lot better."}

{"text":"Atmosphere was great and servers were kind. Food is also good, but the wait for 3 meals (2 of which were kids meals) was over 45 mins....thankful that they brought free appetizers for the kids or we would have had to make it a to-go order!"}
{"text":"Coming from the land of flatbthin pizzas, over the Smokey mountains to find this smokin' hot pizza joint.  I didn't expect a place like this.  The most welcoming and friendly staff. They sang and danced while I walked in. I was coming in from out of town and they made food even so close to closing no complaints.  The smell was soooo good I had to pullover on a side street and sneak a slice on the way back to the hotel.  I've eaten a lot of food in my life and a lot of pizza, let me tell you I would not hesitate sneaking an extra slice of this pie away from a friend even if it meant he wouldn't get to eat.....that delectable."}

My favorite? Large supreme with extra jalepenos."}
{"text":"I had to stop a second and think: What is my major complaint with Doughboy's?. hmmmm. None. I love their pie. It's not a traditional fluffy crust type. It's a little heavier, but that matches their toppings. They have a 2 topping 12 incher that is 2 meals for me. It's 8 bucks, not too bad. The sausage is ground and they heap it on, m m m m yummy. They also have some great wings.

EDIT: Well after sitting, waiting an hour and a half for my pie that I ordered via the website, I decided to call. It was great to get a bunch of attitude and hear how I didn't use the website correctly. I've only been ordering that way for months. Somehow it's my fault and did I check my bank account.? Really? The owner got on the phone and offered no help. He just kept saying \"What do you want me to do?\" I want food! He should have offered to take care of the situation instead of beating around the bush. For the owners ignorance and the girl who answered the phones attitude towards a good customer, you get 1 star.
 You will never see another dollar of mine."}
{"text":"Wings were good. Hoagie was decent, pizza was a 3/10 maybe. Not at all a huge fan. They do have a larger menu. So wouldn't be against trying other items delivery was quick."}
{"text":"$5 medium pizzas? Yes please!! Their pizza was very delicious for the price! It had lots of oregano on it which was awesome! I loved it! They also have a lunch special that consists of 2 slices and a soda for $3! Crazy!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. We are always looking for another pizza to see if they can beat doughboys, but have yet to find a place that stacks up. They are decently priced and quick. We get the cheese or mushroom, there veggie pizza came out soggy on top from the water in the veggies. Other than that, pretty good!"}
{"text":"This place is very interesting. My initial thought on location was, \"They are right in front of a Streets of NY ...and they sell Pizza?? How does that work?\"

Let me tell you I was blown away! Their sauce is really what did it for me. It was some of the best sauce I have ever had! The crust was a good texture, and they put a layer of cheese OVER the toppings. This in my opinion is WIN.

The prices are super reasonable, and the pizza is great! I can see why they have no issue staying in business where they are. I would consider making the drive here just to eat. 

The only thing I wish is they had more dinning room space. As nice as it is outside right now, it doesn't stay nice for long in AZ. That's the only down side.

A+ Guys...you know how to make a pizza!"}
{"text":"The medium pizza special is hard to beat. Good food for a good price. Not the best ever, but good. I haven't tried their other menu items."}
{"text":"The following morning, after infiltrating the clan of pizza lovers at my place of work who worship Doughboy's and fight in its name, their deaths be damned, I was about to meet my own...with no other weapons than my fists!

Blades were dodged, strikes were thrown, a small amount of blood was shed. 

\"FOR DOUGHBOY'S!\" they shouted into the shining frost.

\"FOR YELP!\" I retorted. 

The battle stopped. 

\"So, Darren. What is this Yelp?\" one of my black-suited peers asked. 

\"It's a reviews site and a social networking site.\"

They dropped their swords, looked at each other, and began to listen to me. 

\"I just wanted to promote Doughboy's. That's all. I am a warrior for quality. Doughboy's IS quality, right? The more business they get, the longer they'll be around...right?\"

\"Y'know what, D, you have a point.\"

\"Besides, I just wanted to try them...once.\"

\"Well, we'll let you have some once more, but that's it. We can't have the mongrels getting in on this.\"

\"That's fine.\"

\"Ok, next time we're getting it with meatballs. You in?\"

\"Of, of course!\"

And wouldn't you know the pizza would be better the second time around? Everything I said about the pie has been magnified by my return experience, especially by the dunes of ground chuck, egg, bread crumbs, and herbs. 

A flaky, ample-of- meat Italian Hoagie was also had along with scorching, plumpish chicken wings. 

\"Y'know, man, if you want, you can do this with us regularly. You can hang with us,\" one of them told me casually, belly full. 

\"Ahhh. But I must move on. There is more pizza to review, to conquer!.\"

\"You. Are an eater's eater. Darren.\"

With that, they all bowed to me and I to them. Respect had been earned and was mutual."}
{"text":"OH boy, Doughboy!  Use to have the pizza on a regular basis when worked nearby but sad to say that was a few years ago.  We were in the area and took a pizza home.  Delicious with a thicker crust and a nice sauce.  If you are in the area a good stop.
Take out only.  They do have pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"Good crust. Overall an upgraded little ceaser or howies. Mostly take out setup. Hugh delivery area."}
{"text":"Got a stack of pies for my HS students. They're tough critics, and they loved em. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I'M SO UPSET THEY CLOSED! But this place was my favorite spot to eat pizza! It was so good, super bummed they're no longer open."}
{"text":"I should have known better, when I saw the wings are baked... But, wanted to try anyway. Waste of time and money. Tastes like chef boyardi"}
{"text":"The cinnapies are sooo yum!  And their $5 pizzas are great for last minute potlucks.  Every time I've ordered from them my pizza was always fresh and generous with toppings.  If I had to mention a downside it's that they don't take Discover and I like when business take all forms of payment.  But that still isn't enough to mark them down."}
{"text":"A group of us had the spinach & chicken without the chicken, and the white pizza - both were astonishingly good. Make sure to get the thin crust. The wings were average, but the pizza? Well worth it.
And as a bonus, it was just as good the next day, reheated in a small toaster oven!"}
{"text":"Everyone loves the pizza. My office orders it on a frequent basis and I don't get the hype. Maybe  it's because I've had it so much. I don't know. I've had better and I've had worse. To me this is just average pizza at best."}
{"text":"Takes forever for delivery. Grew up in a town with a pizza place on almost every block, but honestly this place is the best pizza and breadsticks I ever had, ever. They aren't greedy with the toppings and they make the effort to put crust on the pizza, my favorite part! I like the taste of their marinara. It's unfortunate I have driven past this place all my life and not once had it til now. What a blessing lol"}
{"text":"Pizza tasted ok but was pretty greasy. Pizza box bottom was covered with grease when we got home. However, BBQ wings were excellent. Some people may like this place. My families vote was to get pizza somewhere else next time. Sorry I like to support local businesses, but they need to improve the quality of their pizza."}
