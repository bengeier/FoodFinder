{"text":"Recently changed ownership so if you've been to the \"dive\" before,  give it another try,  it's been redecorated and the menu updated,  not gourmet food and I hate that only the worst brewed beers are ever on special (local other places discount ALL beverages... Draws a bigger crowd,  hint hint) but an OK local bar"}
{"text":"Time for an update.  The whole place has been remodeled, new kitchen, 16 +/- 52\" flat screen tvs, desperately needed new bathrooms (yeah!!!)

It's a local bar, with some decent and some great foods. The appetizers have a buffalo chicken flat bread that is great, really good coconut shrimp, decent hoagies ( try the meatball or pot roast), and some great sandwiches fish, grilled chicken, and really good hamburgers (good quality, no filler, and decent size).  The dinners and salads are good, and very ample amount of food.

Their specialty is wings. The whole wings look like they are turkey wings. They are huge with tons of meat. Or you can order 1/2 cut wings. They are on special every day now.  I love the buffalo. I like to order them crispy.  But they have a wide variety of good sauces, or dry rubs.

The crowd is friendly, there are some groups of regulars that will keep you entertained, or leave you to your peace.  The staff will do anything you would like,  need to watch a favorite game... they will put it on the nearest screen for you, just ask.  Your drink won't go empty.  The prices are very very reasonable,  there is an area to the side away from the bar that is convenient for families, pool tables on the other side, and an outside patio open for smokers.

Drop in, say hi, and have a drink.  It's a fun bar.  And if Chris the owner is there, which is all the timeLOL, he loves to talk about what new changes might be coming, or the latest game.  Ok see you there!!"}
{"text":"Ok.  This is my local pub.  About 1.5 miles from the homestead.  I could write a book about this place. 

First and foremost the driinks are cheap...very cheap.  Top.shelf is under $4.  Drafts on special $1.25.  Enough said.  

Food is decent bar grade.  Wings are HUGE!  Wing special is Tuesday for$ .75. Sounds pricey but I dare you to eat a dozen. Other food is ok.  Bartenders are all good looking, first class and very attentive (except for maybe one).  Jenny is my favorite. Your glass will never to empty and her attitude is beyond reproach.  

If the owner, Gerry ia sitting at the end of the bar don't be surprised if he buys you a drink.  

Local watering hole....the best!"}
{"text":"Six of us went in for lunch, we were all surprised at the amount of food that was served to us. We all had cod sandwiches and fries, the fish was awesome."}
{"text":"I went to visit friends in Sewickley this August and they invited my wife and I  to visit the Hangar on a Saturday night.  I was little apprehensive at first, knowing that it's a sports bar and normally the quality of the food is not the greatest.  Well this place shut me up.  I ordered a steak burger with bacon, cheese fries with bacon and a nice cold Coors Light.  The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly, the fries we fresh and crisp with a wonderful coating of cheese and bacon.  The manger Scott came by the table and asked us how everything tasted and if we comfortable.  That to me is a way to make me a repeat customer.  Shortly after eating, a DJ arrived and started playing music.  Needless to say, after a lot of dancing, drinking and overall great time, I'm waiting to make the drive from Detroit back to my favorite sports bar in Pennsylvania."}
{"text":"Higher prices and lower quality under the new ownership. For ages this had been one of my go to places, but now I'm exploring other dive bar options in the neighborhood.  There is plenty of competition. Everybody has beer and wings."}
{"text":"I don't care who wants to be our server or who is suppose to be our server... If I walk up to the bar privately to put an order in TAKE IT, and worry about who's going to get the tip later.

Instead we sat here at a group table with empty beer bottles and no pizza orders. It's not important that I WAS going to order for multiple people (the reason I came up privately to order) to not interrupt the group meeting. 

Thanks hangar servers, for being so helpful"}
{"text":"Had a great time here last night! Great food and drinks, I ordered a buffalo chicken salad and a flatbread. They had a really good DJ and a good crowd."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I used to routinely come down to the Hangar for lunch and happy hour but each time it would take at least 40 minutes for food and sometimes our drinks would get mixed up. The lunch service was usually subpar and it never made sense because only 10 patrons, at maximum,  would be there at the same time. Lately, our food has taken over an hour to come to us and it's simply unacceptable. Drinks are cheap (though sometimes skunky) and the food is generally pretty good and tasty. But we don't have the time and patience anymore for this place."}
{"text":"Great special dollar tacos on a Thursday!  Tacos were filled nicely, no skimping here!  Drinks reasonably priced!  Very close to home.  Three of us, we ordered basket of fries, a total of 7 tacos, 2 big beers and a jack/ coke, $23..... can't beat it!"}
{"text":"A group of us descended upon this bar on a night where partying was in order. The exterior reminded me of the bars the Terminator would go into when he first landed on earth and take some biker's gear by force. 

As we entered we were happy to see there were only 2 people there (more room for us to engage in buffoonery). The bartender was eager to serve but I can't say she was happy. She seemed to want our business but it seemed like it was a chore for her to attend us. Whatever, we didn't care...the drinks are ridiculously cheap. Liquor, beer, shots...it was about 3 bucks for anything. 

We went over to shoot pool and the tables are a whopping 75 cents. There is a jukebox too but the software was a little outdated and it made it hard to pick the song you wanted. For some reason it picked the song above or below the one you tried to select. The songs on it weren't the most popular ones of the artist's either...it was strange. As the place got packed the bartender seemed to get a little backed up at times but to give her credit, we were thirsty and she was alone. 

There is food on the menu but we didn't try any. It's not a bad little dive, nothing special but not a bad place to grab some drinks and shoot pool."}
{"text":"We ordered take out at dinner time. They shorted our order, but fortunately, we live close by and returned to pick up the missing food. Everything, from my steak wrap to my wife's chicken salad, was so salty that it was almost inedible. The homemade potato chips were coated with so much seasoning that they made your tongue go numb.  Avoid this place if you are looking for quality food, there are too many good options near bye."}
{"text":"First off, we sat in a booth.  Server/bartender (only 1 on duty since it was early afternoon) came over took our drink order, returned and took the food order. When I asked if they had fresh cut fries, she replied \"we can\".  What kind of answer is that.  Not sure why, but I ordered them.  We both agreed she was a bit rude.  But when she returned to the bar her friendliness magically appeared.  Apparently, she's nice to the five men at the bar who seemed as if they were all regulars.  Wouldn't you want us to become regulars??

We were the only ones eating and it probably took about 20 minutes for the food to be served. Way too long for what we had.  I had the buffalo, bacon dog which was battered, deep fried & wrapped in bacon. Was a good beef hotdog and actually was pretty good.  Husband had the hot roast beef sandwich.  While he said it was ok, he also said it  was more like a pot roast.  Now back to those fresh cut fries.  We both got them.  While I know they look different than frozen, they were way more brown than most places, and they were very grease-soaked.  I told her so, and asked if I could get frozen.  She obliged, and they were much better.  For some reason my husband ate half of his and ended up feeling nauseous  a little later."}
{"text":"Being from out of town I was looking for a neighborhood dive bar. This place is it. Service great. My blonde bartender was great and friendly. The regulars at the bar made me feel welcomed. Food was average at best. Got the steak hoggie. Lot of bread / lettuce / tomato. No meat. Should of got the wing special. I'd go back for the drinks and wings special. But only if I wanted the regular vibe type of place."}
{"text":"I'm new to Yelp and wanted to make sure I gave The Hangar a great review. I held my husband's 50th party here in February and it was terrific. Chris was great to work with. Great prices and they even decorated for us. Everyone loved the food and the waitress who took care of us did an excellent job. We also go for dinner a lot and we recommend to everyone !"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch.A. hogie,potato skins and a root beer. Nice clean place. Pricey but very good. Slow as molasses 45 min wait for food and there were only 8 people in the Place Good Pirate game on tv so I won't  complain"}
{"text":"Great place for the games !!! Wings are fire ! Place is great local or if you are in town by the airport go stop in."}
{"text":"Took a little over 35 minutes to get a sandwich and salad, waitress never offered to refill drinks. Sandwich was good but a Mediterranean flatbread was a big disappointment for $11.29 (no sides included). Not worth the wait or price."}
{"text":"I got a chuckle that this place was listed under \"Dive bars\".   I wouldn't call it a dive bar, but but it's close.    It does need a through cleaning, but if you can get past that the (bar) food is pretty darn good.

The beer selection isn't the biggest, and I can't speak for the bar prices but the food is decent and the prices are pretty good.

Opt for their homemade chips instead of fries and thank me later."}
{"text":"Guys,  I'm a big fan, but your Bang Bang shrimp is a joke and embarrassment. $5.99 for 5 lame salad shrimp sauteed? The sauce wasn't even hot. I would have said something but didn't think it would resonate w the bartenders. The one bartender almost seemed embarrassed to serve it. Keep trying guys. You have an awesome place."}
{"text":"Right outside the metropolitan areas of Pittsburgh sits this little bar called Hangar. No, its not an an Airplane Hangar, which would make it 10x cooler automatically- but it has the makings of a great little bar. Decent food, good beer on tap (Octoberfest), and ample space on the patio to have fun with your friends. Nothing amazing but I had a pretty good time here at a minimal cost. So I couldn't give it 3 stars . Maybe a 3.5, it would be nice if they used the outside speakers, but I don't like country music anyway. 

Food was normal bar food- I didnt eat any of the pizza, but the cheesesteak and southwest burger hit the spot. 3.5/5

It was cheap, it was fun, and it was chill. 

3.7/5- lets round up..."}
{"text":"New ownership still has a way to go, all bottled beer was warm, new paint and bathrooms are a little upgrade still has a long road ahead"}
{"text":"Good place to be this is my first pick to get a drink or some thing to eat good food great people i try to get here as much as i can cant wait till i have a chance to go"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to love going to the Hangar.  We hadn't been there in quite awhile so we went yesterday early evening for \"Taco Night\".  

Draft beer was flat and the tacos weren't as good as they used to be.  Had to go find silverware and napkins as none were provided.  

Service was horrible.  Took 25+ minutes for our order to arrive.  Owner eventually came by after a very long time of seeing no one and it turned out that the bartender was our server and she got busy at the bar.   My husband ordered another taco and that took another 25+ minutes.  

Very disappointed   We won't go back.  New owner needs to seriously consider hiring some servers instead of trying to save $$ by doing it himself.  Maybe he's working the kitchen too... for as long as it took for our food to arrive."}
{"text":"The Hangar has been one of my companies favorite places to meeting places for the past 3 years until our last couple of visits after the ownership change. The last time we came it took over an hour to be told our order didn't happen. But not only that, Prices are up, Portions and quality are down, and service has become incredibly slow. It's really tough for us to say that we won't be coming to the hangar anymore."}
{"text":"Well, a great classic for local society and people visiting ! Great food, pleasant atmosphere  . Can't really go wrong with this place  ."}
{"text":"I found myself at the Hangar after a Meetup HH was going to end too early. Good enough. ordered 2 vodka w soda water and splash of cran juice and lime...did not get the lime-  these are called a Rose Kennedy but no one knows. Now this place is listed as - Dive Bars, American (Traditional), Sports Bars-- 1$- To check out-OMG  $4.50 for each drink an $1 for the cranberry splash.  This is not Jackson's for the love of everything holy. The server apologized- I know it is not on her. Where do I upload the receipt!! I will not buy a drink there again."}
{"text":"Had a party here with lots of friends. Owners were super helpful in planning. Wait staff was great, food was good & my party was awesome!"}
