{"text":"Another small gem in Queen West. Great tasting food (you have to try the Koubideh), relaxed yet original atmosphere, good service. All round good times."}
{"text":"Great vodka cocktails with a unique middle eastern twists; and the food is pretty great too!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Kabob was very juicy (maybe cause it's not Halal.. not sure though). Cool political theme within the restaurant.   However... Pomegranate wine is wine with pomegranate juice. That's thievery. Service is horrible. I swear my waiters were drunk.  The worst thing about this place is how expensive it is for no absolute reason.  It's part of Persian culture to give meat with rice. They charge you for rice. Rice costs about 2 cents. They charge you like 5 bucks.   I get they're trying to be this higher-end Persian place, but don't it's insulting to my intelligence when you charge me for rice with my koobideh.   For two people, the bill came up to $120. I left hungry."}
{"text":"Food here was excellent. Really chill restaurant with a good vibe. Everything we ordered was great. I recommend the BBQ chicken. i was hesitant to order it at a persian place and miss out on something else, but it was totally worth it. Also, they had mixed drink with lime and mint which was bomb. I polished off three. The place wasn't exactly cheap but i walked away incredibly satisfied that they could have added an extra zero on my bill and i'd have been fine with it. if ure looking for a really pleasurable dinning experience go here."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. We had a large group and it took 3 hours for food to come out.  They were out of most of the dishes and some of the beer."}
{"text":"It was a terrible experience for me. Don't recommend this place at all! First, the quality of the food is very low( oily, salty and old). Second,  quantity! Portions are unbelievably small!  I paid 18$ for lamb shank, and what I got was just 2 small pieces with out anything on the side!! Third, it is way over priced! My husband and I paid around 100$  and we were still hungry! Because everything was just a bite!!  Don't waste your time, money and appetite by going to this place!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the food itself was quiet good.  However, I will echo what others have said about the service.  It felt like they didn't want us, as customers there.  We were in a larger group (around 8) so we got charged the \"service fee\" even though the service was horrible.  The bad service included unfriendly waitress (the one guy working there was nice), removing of drinks before they were finished (and then arguing that they were finished even though it was witnessed by other people on the table that they weren't), etc.  The biggest reason I want to point a warning on here is that their menu is misleading.  They have two prices on the menu and it leads you to believe that the higher price is for 2 skewers and the other price is for 1 but in reality the higher price is for one skewer and the lower price is for a half portion!    If they were upfront with it that would be one thing but I feel like they are purposely misleading people by the way things are worded.  There are better options for Persian food out there and for me the quality of the food isn't the only reason to visit a spot.  I want good /friendly service as well.  Also, a quick note that I e-mailed the restaurant about our experiences just so they were aware and they never even bothered to respond to my e-mail to even acknowledge it."}
{"text":"Love this place! One of my absolute favourite restaurants in Toronto. So delicious, every single time I ago. Not only is the food incredible, but the people are just as amazing. EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Nice flavors, but very very very overpriced for  regular dinner menu.  I have no problem paying high prices, but I just felt like the prices were too high for what I got.  I will say, the food tasted great .  Wouldn't mind going back for lunch or a dinner special."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places of all time. Best Iranian in the city."}
{"text":"I went there for winterlicious, and was glad i didnt pay more for that food+service combo. The potage was bland, the smoked eggplant was a bit too smoky and flavorless. The vegeterian main course - Baghali gatou was highly okay with a ton of rice and small portion of stew (the dill in it was the saving grace). The server seemed very cold and businessy. The decor is a bit cheesy, and even the cutlery they used was in-consistent."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. Salad e Khaneh and the kabob were excellent. Great service. Recommend"}
{"text":"A large group (15+) of us went there for Summerlicious lunch. The food was delicious. The staff was good and they got all of our orders right, ensured that we always had water, etc. The atmosphere was fine -- we were upstairs which is not as good as downstairs. I have no complaints about that though as we were too large a group to be seated downstairs.   What I do have a complaint about is mandatory gratuity (hence the lower rating). When we were brought our bill, it had 20% gratuity already added to it. That is 20% after-tax, so about 22% on the original amount. The after gratuity amount was what we were told we had to pay and we were told that it is their policy to add it for large groups (even though it is not on the menu nor were we told in advance).  I have no issues with paying a good tip for good service, and the service was good. The amount of it is not a big deal either as just a dollar here and there, but it is the principle of it. I have an issue with not being told upfront. 22% is a rather large amount (we were told that gratuity \"after-tax\" is standard -- I have rarely seen  that so it is hardly standard, and nor have I seen a 20% mandatory gratuity). Usually it is 15-18% and the restaurants make the amount very clear before we order (either via menu or being told by staff).  So, good food, good atmosphere, good service, but be sure to ask about their gratuity policy if you are in a large group."}
{"text":"I'm really glad I came to Banu this evening. The food was delicious, elegant and unique. I loved the pomegranate wine (it reminded me of a summer sangria). For appetizers my party of two tried the Kashk e bademjoon (eggplant dish) and Laboo (beet salad). Lovely fresh flavours with delicious aromatic herbs to compliment.   For a main I had the Torsh kebab. The marinate was divine. The meat melted in my mouth.   The service was superb and friendly, always checking on our table to see if there was anything we would like.  Definitely one of the best Iranian restaurants in Toronto and the GTA."}
{"text":"I've tried just about every Iranian restaurant in Toronto, but I keep coming back to this one since it is hands down the best. I usually get the mast o moseer (a garlic yogurt appetizer), the chenjeh (beef tenderloin in a citrus yogurt marinade), and a glass of pomegranate wine. For a gourmet restaurant that serves organic meat sourced from the Healthy Butcher, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. The last time I went, I had to get a doggy bag for the leftovers. The place is owned by three siblings, two sisters and a brother, all of whom are super friendly and nice. The food does seem to taste better on the days that the brother is at the grill."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant. First of all the servers were extremely rude and the service was terrible. Server didn't greet us nicely at all. She was almost throwing the dishes in front of us on the table It was my second time at banu restaurant, the first was few years ago and I had a great experience in terms of service and the food itself ; that's why I decided to take my friend there after a long time. It was pretty obvious that the food quality has changed over the years. Food portion was so small and extremely expensive. I will never ever go to banu People it is waste of your time and money !!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious lunch. Everything was amazing from start to finish. Great food, great service and great drinks. The lentil salad, roasted beet soup and koobideh were all delicious. The almond baklava cake dessert was the perfect finish. Definitely recommend it for some good Iranian food."}
{"text":"the good stuff first - the food was fantastic - from the eggplant dip (i don't remember the iranian name) to the koobideh to the pistachio iceream - yum!  the flavours were divine.  even the sparkling pomegranate wine, which was actually a sangria with some pomegranate seeds in it, was worth the $8.  but here's the not so good stuff - the service was torturously slow.   i was there with a friend and we waited over 45 minutes for our entrees and had to ask the wait staff not once but twice for when we were going to get them.  in all fairness, it was a fairly busy winterlicious night but shouldn't they have planned for this?"}
{"text":"the food is amazing. Meat is tender and all dishes are prepared fresh. Eggplant w turmeric, yogurt w garlic and lentil salad are my favourite appetizers. all meats dishes are delicious and the veal shank stew is outstanding."}
{"text":"Only the bread took my attention. Lack  of authenticity is significantly shown by missing important ingredients in authentic persian dishes such as mirzaghasemi which had no eggs. Over priced. Small kitchen. 2 cooks only. main orders too much time to arrive. This was my first andclast time there."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner with a girlfriend. Loved the ambience. The staff were friendly and readily willing to answer any questions annoy the menu. The bartender recommended some great Martina's with shaved cucumber ....delish would highly recommend Banu"}
{"text":"Living downtown Toronto there is definitely a lack of good quality Persian food, actually that's a general comment for all of Toronto. Normally \"Persian Food\" consists of mystery meat drenched in oil. Banu is the exact opposite. All meat here is organic, which is a massive plus just on it's own. Not only is the kabab torsh the most delicious kabab torsh I have ever tasted, and trust me I have had many, it really does melt in your mouth. The Winterlicious is really a bargain. For lunch at $15 and you are getting organic meat, I would say run, don't walk to get a table, run. The dinner which I have also had because did I mention that this is my favourite restaurant in the city, is equally as amazing as you get to try different items that are on their menu. The fesenjoon which is the same flavour base as the kabob torsh is not only vegetarian it's delicious. Honestly I don't know what is wrong with the person below, he obviously has some sort of Persian complex as most persians do. Not only do I recommend going for their regular menu but also Winterlicious is honestly a great value. The staff is extremely friendly and very accomodating, I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"horrible experience. too expensive and rude waiter/waitress. they must think people are fools to put up with this non-sense."}
{"text":"Went to Banu for a birthday dinner during Winterlicious. The beet salad was nice, though the soup was mostly tasteless, too salty and thick. The one non meat main dish offered, a vegan lima bean stew, was grey and sticky and frankly inedible. Two people in our party had the kebabs and one couldn't eat it either due to the texture of ground beef and unpleasant odour, which  also greeted us in the restaurant when we arrived. The final dampener on the evening was when the waitress spilled an entire glass of water on the inside of our coats, leather gloves and bag, and half-heartedly sponged it off, offering us paper towels to help her. She evidently told other guests about it, who appeared to find the incident amusing. As it was a cold winter day, we found it less so. She had placed our coats to dry on the back of bar stools, where we later retrieved them beneath one client who was seated on it and another's scarf. I had to ask them to close one of the double doors at the front as a cold wind was making it unpleasant even in the back.  The best part of the meal was something they didn't cook themselves- ice cream from Death in Venice. $160. for 4, for beet salad, ice cream, 1 beer and 2 uneaten meals was a bit much, and why my partner nevertheless left a 15% tip is a mystery."}
{"text":"From the moment a patron steps into a restaurant, they are subconsciously reading various cues that are helping them build perceptions around the quality of food, the service and the overall dining experience they can expect to have. On entering this restaurant, I was impressed by the pleasant decor, jazzy Persian music playing in the background and soft lighting set to the perfect amount of illumination. I was liking it so far and having looked at the prices and the overall ambiance, I had already set expectations about the eating experience I was about to get.  Sadly, there are times when what you get is very different than what the restaurant has prepared you to expect. Banu is a perfect example of this dichotomy.  We went to this restaurant in a group of four for their Winterlicious prix fixe lunch. Things were off right from the start. The servers were clearly unhappy about something; maybe it was the stress of Winterlicious, maybe they were short staffed, or maybe it was one of the scores of other problems that frontline staff in service industry experience. In any case, it is well known that the server's mood at a restaurant directly influences how patrons experience the place.  The prix fixe menu, priced at $15, included an appetizer, a main and a dessert. Between us we ordered two different appetizers and they were both ordinary. I got the smoked eggplant + mashed tomato dish and I was expecting something more than a just a blend of eggplant and tomato, but there was nothing more to it. My friend got a beef main (excessively salty and very tart) while I got a dill-based vegetarian dish with beans (also very salty). All of us were left thoroughly unimpressed with the food - drenching it in oil and salt is not going to help anyone. The prices might have been okay for winterlicious, but otherwise it is simply off.  With three points for service.and one point for food I'd say \"meh\" is a good way of expressing the experience at this restaurant. I suggest if the restaurant wants to do a god job for that price point, quality of food and the service is something they cannot afford to be sloppy about."}
{"text":"Went and had their summerlicious menu. It was delicious! Some may think this place is expensive but u get what u pay for! Skewers are good quality meat i personally like that they don't give you a huge side of rice. Service was good :)"}
{"text":"Dear Banu owner,  Thank you for the delicious Iranian food that you consistently serve at Banu. My friends and I always enjoy the food and the drinks--however, what we do not enjoy is the confused wannabe hipster persona that you have attached to Banu via your ignorant attitude.  IMHO, on your next day off I recommend you visit one of the following restaurants to take notes on what the underlying key to the art of hospitality is. ie. Scaramouche, Bar Isabel, Agua Y Aguacate, etc.  I hope you see this review not as an attack on your personality, but as positive criticism to improve the total dining experience at Banu for your patrons.   Warm regards, -gw"}
{"text":"Banu is so great. I love the food and how consistently excellent it tastes. The service may seem gruff at first but after a small introduction the staff is as classy and polite as anywhere I've been. I've been to banu about 25 times and loved each visit.   I simply can not understand the occasional poor review this restaurant has received.   Definitely a gem in the Toronto restaurant scene."}
{"text":"If you are Muslim stay away from this restaurant as the owners have some 36 year old chip on their shoulders and really hate them."}
{"text":"Best Persian restaurant on the west side of Caspian sea! I live in NY and dream about Banu's Kabob Torsh. Must go while in Toronto. Don't let the false rating fool ya, Or even try to school ya! Oh, no!"}
{"text":"Banu is not only the best Persian food in town, it is one of my all time favourite places to eat. I love their original decore, the mabiance but specially the food. The Kabob Torsh is amazing, Koobideh is one of the best I have ever had and the Chicken kababs are to die for. They have a great wine and cocktails selection. I also love the service. It's unpretentious but friendly. You walk in there and it's like you have walked into an extension of your home.  I understand it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those of us who get the concept, it's a heaven sent."}
{"text":"I'm loving the diversity in the Queen/Bathurst area where I started working!! There's never an end to exciting lunches :)  Awesome place with nice decor, friendly service - $10 lunch is worth it for the yummy freshly grilled Koobideh, bread and fresh herbs all wrapped up. Also really love the olive dip they have - Zeitun Parvadeh - never tasted anything like this before!  Would love to stop by for dinner one day!"}
{"text":"Very average food that is overpriced with horrible customer service. Our server was very demeaning and rude. Never going back."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes passé pour Winterlicious avec nos amis. Tout d'abord, la cuisine : excellente. Relevée, avec du goût, d'une authenticité vérifiée et de grande qualité. Le service, c'est plus compliqué. Notre serveuse était très sympathique mais l'ensemble du service semblait dépassé par de petites choses, d'où une certaine confusion et une lenteur épisodique.   Rien de grave cependant sauf un tout petit détail : pourquoi mettre '20%' de service sur le premier écran à cet effet sur la machine à paiement ? C'est courant de mettre 15 % comme option générale et proposer au client d'autres modalités sur les autres écrans, cependant dégainer à 20 %, c'est un peu gros ! Rien que pour ça, je zappe une étoile."}
{"text":"I love Iranian food so even before I entered this place it started with 5 stars and could have only headed downhill from there. It came strongly recommended by both our hotel and Yelp. Honestly the food was pretty good (four star quality), but I dock a star because of the attitude. I dislike restaurateurs with attitude - fact of the matter is even if you're the owner you're not an avant-garde artiste redefining the meaning of existence.. You are someone working within the SERVICE industry and are (or should be) beholden to your customer. It's flabbergasting to me that a waitress could have such a degree of cockiness and disregard for her clients, especially if she's quite a mediocre waitress to begin with. Next time, check your pride at the door and focus on making your customer's experience a good one. It's your job.  Oh, and the portions were so small and miserable it was a joke. I'm from San Francisco so don't go around saying I expected Kansas City-size meals, but these portions were almost an insult especially when paired with those prices and a very average unassuming atmosphere. I don't know if Toronto has any better, but if not, just move to SF.  One last point: scroll down to the bottom of the page and you can see 7 \"filtered\" reviews... Most of which speak to the same shortcomings that I highlighted in this review. Somewhat shady, no?  EDIT: I think the restaurant's response to me speaks for itself. I'd like to add that they've also sent me multiple messages through Yelp with the same anti-consumer drivel as below. Shrug, dock a star, and move on."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, both for food and ambiance. You just have to \"behave\" yourself, or you'll get the \"soup Nazi\" treatment."}
{"text":"Its casual but from the menu its more than just a fancy entre. The place is small so the atmosphere is very laid back.  The mint tea is by far my favorite,  The yogurt with spinach was absolutely amazing I was really dissapointed with the chocolate nougat with cranberry. Its actually just 4 slices of chocolate, plain and a bit too rich for my liking.  all in all, its not a bad place for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Who knew Iranian food was so delicious! Great experience! I didn't know anything about this food and I felt like I was in Iran"}
{"text":"Delicious high-end persian food. Definitely a bit fancier than your normal persian restaurant but great food quality. Very nice environment, very classy but still Iranian style. Been here twice and quality remains excellent. The staff is extremely nice. And the best thing Ive had here is the Torsh, and Pomegranate wine in the drinks! Amazingggg!"}
{"text":"Food quality   Horrible.  Food Portion    Less than all other Persian Rastuarant. Price     The most expensive and unfair price .  It was my second time in last 6 years. I was hopping that  I would experience different Banu this time!!! Not only I didnt , it was worth than the first visit. I should have listened to all my friends who already faced this bad experience.  Never come back to this Rastuarant."}
{"text":"To Samira:  What you have written does not add up and you've made several leaps of logic and false claims.  Your responses to me and all the other yelpers who have provided honest feedback that was not favourable to you are incredibly pretentious and arrogant.   Using the excuse of 'organic' does not justify the kinds of prices you are charging for the food that you are serving. I've noticed that you have been regurgitating this same argument again and again to anyone on yelp who has criticized your restaurant. While I am well aware that price adjustments to cover the expense of quality organic ingredients is necessary, it is not to the extent that you claim.  My family, like you, owns a restaurant that only uses the freshest of ingredients including grain fed cattle, free range organic chicken and certified organic new zealand lamb and we are still able to keep our prices within reason.  Similar to your establishment, we too have notable celebrities including Bob Dylan, Dan Akroyd, David Usher and the Tragically Hip who frequent our establishment.  Unlike you however, if one of our customers has a criticism or complaint about our restaurant, we would not be so pretentious as to use that celebrity's tastes to add credence to the quality of the food at our restaurant against a regular customers point of view; that is just arrogant. Whether Nahlah Ayed enjoyed the food at your restaurant or not is a redundant and cheap argument to use in defence of your restaurant against me.  I am sure Nahlah herself would be disappointed with your elitist leap of logic.   Although I agree that I should have been more specific in my review, weather I had the khoobideh or another dish does not lessen the credibility of my experience at your restaurant.  I am speaking of MY dining experience.  I cannot comment on those other dishes, nor is it an expectation that I comment on these other items.  Accusing me of being 'dishonest' is disproportionate and underhanded.   Similarly, whether I enjoyed the food at Super Khorak (which you sneakily found out by doing a background check into my yelping activities) or not is also a completely presumptuous and redundant point.  When I mentioned other Persian restaurants I was not equating your establishment to Super Khorak ---which is a completely different kind of place--- rather it was to other comparable fine dining Persian restaurants in the city. Also, I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about when you write this \"we also do not bring you the compulsory...\" and so on... this made no sense to me at all, although yet again you do sound very arrogant.   I find it very insulting the way you described the actions of my friend in such a dishonest manner.  My friend simply asked why it would not be possible for us to switch to another table.  As I mentioned, we did not hold that against you because we recognized that there were several reservations.  This completely false idea that he tried to 'bamboozle' his way to another table and 'belittle' the waiter is absolutely ridiculous.  We had a pleasant experience with our waiter, and at no point did he express frustration at our request.  All this proves again is the kind of cheap, personally insulting and underhanded tactics that you use to defend your restaurant.  It is pretty obvious by now that you have made a habit out of insulting anyone who gives honest feedback about your restaurant on yelp.  You are by far the most pretentious and arrogant owner of a restaurant I have ever come into contact with and it is clear by now that many others feel the same way about your poor service."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious. The menu was impressive, good flavors, good service.  It was a good break to try out Iranian cuisine."}
{"text":"Very bad service! Waiter was rude and confused, he put everyone's order on the same bill and refused to separate it so we had to do it our self, which took over an hour, and then the owner's son came to see what's happening but then ended up being more rude to us telling us \"you wasted my time\". I'M NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"I think I set my expectations a little too high for this place to begin with.  Maybe I've just tried too many Persian restaurants in North York where I can get twice the quality for half the price but this place felt very westernized when it came to the taste.  Now the food is not terrible, it's good for what it is, but the value just isn't there for what they charge."}
{"text":"Horrible quality,  small plates and overpriced. I live on the west coast where you can try different Persian restaurants. Shockingly,  this place is worse than the worst that I've ever seen. So disappointing on my first visit to Toronto..."}
{"text":"1ere expérience de gastronomie iranienne! Le banu est un restaurant assez chic avec éclairage tamisé et musique traditionelle. J'y étais avec 2 amis iraniens donc le choix des plats n'a pas été d'une grande difficulté, j'ai commandé le kabob au boeuf, et là j'ai pleuré..... Le plat est servi avec des feuilles de menthe, tomates et galettes + une sauce. Au niveau des boissons vous pouvez commander des sortes de smoothie \"carbonate\" qui ont l'air très sympas et les desserts sont composés de glaces et baklava. Possibilité également de commander une chicha. Attention vous pouvez faire monter la note facilement à 50$ mais je pense que ça vaut le coup pour les grandes occasions.  PS: un nombre impressionnant de vodkas à la carte; innatendu!"}
{"text":"We went today for lunch and had the koobideh. Fantastic. Tastes really good. The portion size is equivalent to the price ($11). If you are really hungry you will need to order other stuff. I believe it is a great cost-benefit. Will be back for diner as it seems they have more options at night."}
{"text":"Wow I am kind of shocked that Banu has received so many poor ratings, that being said I am sure folks has their reasons, but I will share my thoughts and experience on Banu  First and foremost, the food is AMAZING, yes I am been to many Persian and middle eastern restaurants  The best organic KOOBIDEH I HAD EVER TREID, its just perfect the Chef and Owner ( Amir ) knows what he is doing and has been always amazing to me, my co-workers, and my family   I would ask you guys to give this place shot of their food, Sheesha and their unbelievable Mint tea  We had staff parties, birthday parties, going away parties, party of 4 dinners taken over the whole restaurant without making it a private party  and we were always happy with everything"}
{"text":"All in all a great meal, would come back again to try more of the menu! I'd been wanting to check this place out for a while, and winterlicious was the perfect opportunity.   Started with the roasted eggplant/tomato dish which was delicious, and the grilled romaine which had a nice vinaigrette to top it.   The saffron chicken dish was wonderfully flavourful and the rice with cranberries balanced in out nicely. The vegan stew was underwhelming and lacking flavour.   Dessert was the baklava - a yummy & dense almond cake, along with the saffron/rose water rolled cake - on the lighter side."}
{"text":"I'm torn writing this review. The owner is so nice and the food is delicious but the value is not there and the service is inconsistent.   There have been times where the service has been outstanding (typically when the owner is serving us) but also been times where it takes forever for someone to take our order, no water refills and no check-ins to see how the food is tasting. I also find the portions are super small for what you pay. The pomegranate wine is truly amazing but again, you pay a premium.   When I come here and it's amazing, they out do themselves but I've also come here quite a few times and have been disappointed. I think they need to re-evaluate their value for money for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tiny but beautiful, with excellent well portioned food that is not halal for people who do not eat halal and Sikhs who would like to try Iranian food.  The Yoghurts are a delicious appetizer, and the Koobidah and  Bareh Torsh - are divine. The atmosphere and decor is gorgeous.  Good for groups of 4 to 6 people, the restaurant is tiny, so don't think it can hold larger parties, unless you reserve the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed my experience here. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious and the service was extremely good. The server had great knowledge with the menu and was extremely friendly. I tried their traditional tea which was strong with a unique soothing taste. I got the kebab and the meal was a little salty but flavourful. I got here earlier than normal dinner time and once customers came in for dinner time, at one point, it seemed as if the workers got together and all took a shot together? Either way, my experience was good."}
{"text":"Went there for Winterlicious lunch. The place looks old outside, you can even barely notice it when passing by, but the inside is delicate.  Had the postage for start. The soup was thick but tasted like it has goat dairy in there, not my thing.  The koofteh was really good, beef with herb and peas mixed the flavour, two pieces of naan are perfect for the gravy.  The cake tasted special because of the saffron and rose water, plus sprinkled with pistachio, very yum."}
{"text":"Every dish was amazing but in particular the Torsh. The restaurant is small but comfortable, without it feeling like you're too close to the next group. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes. I was very impressed. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place    Great food, warm service.   I would recommend to all, having the torsh, spinach yogurt, laboo salad and an Emerald Isle!!  Best meal"}
{"text":"The food and the place are amazing! The staff are sweet. The decor is simple and elegant, well complimented by the beautiful 60s Persian music playing in the background. We had Kabab torsh and Dandeh, and both were nicely done. The salad shirazi and zeintoon were also amazing. Definitely recommend it if you are debating were to have a nice dinner with friends or even a date."}
{"text":"Fantastic Persian food! Having lived in the middle east most of my life I have never come across a restaurant in Toronto where the meat melts in your mouth. The chicken is especially succulent and tender as are the lamb chops. The olive walnut appetizer served with warm sesame break is delightful as is the yoghurt dip and salad. Also the beets are great. Desserts are nice and refreshing and overall the food was just yum! Server was very friendly and they accommodated us without a booking on a Sat nite but luckily we were early. Cosy atmosphere and delicious food and filled with Persians so it has to be good. Definitely a place to revisit!"}
{"text":"So I walk into this place which advertises itself on Yelp, google maps and others as a Persian cuisine and Hookah lounge place and the first thing the waiter says is \"we're out of hookah and haven't had time to restock\"!!! Really, if you are a Persian food place would you run out of Persian food? If not then how exactly do you run out of hookah! If you run out of one of your two main items, how reliable can you be? What a disappointment of a place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the last time was for Winterlicious just yesterday. I have to say that this place can turn a vegetarian into a meat eater. Im not a huge fan of Persian food or meat for that matter but the beef tenderloin was the tastiest I've ever had. Very homely food - the vegetarian dishes are as well executed as the meat based ones. Beautiful and comfy decor . Go buy some shoes at heel boy when you're done ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely a 5 star food, is it expensive for the portion size? YES, does it worth it?!  The answer is ABSOLUTELY,  Liked the cocktail menu and tried the saffron infused vodka with cherry, the unique taste that you won't get anywhere else, we had Kashke bademjan as an appetizer...tasted  exactly as it supposed to, which you don't necessarily get that in every Persian restaurant, as a main we tried the koobideh and kabab torsh, both   amazing with the thin bread that they provide to make small sandwiches. For the ones that you don't know Persian cuisine you can ask your waitress for informations on the taste to.order the right food for your taste... Friendly staff and nice atmosphere. I'm sold and will go back sowto truth rest of the cocktails and other foods"}
{"text":"A for Iranian Food!!  The Winterlicious Menu for $15 + 3 courses = perfect sunday afternoon.  Went with a friend, for the appetizer, I got the LENTIL SALAD - with yummy bits of parsley and green onion, topped off with fresh zesty lemon tasted so fresh.  My friend had the IRANIAN LEGUME, MIXED HERB, AND BUCKWHEAT NOODLE POTAGE - was like a delicious stew with bread.  Main course, we shared the platter - GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST with saffron and citrus and the GROUND ANGUS SIRLON KABOB, they kindly put it on the plate together with wraps where we could wrap it ourselves.  Toppings included fresh rosemary and mint leaves, yogurt dip, grilled tomato and Iranian saffron - which was deelicious... The wrap tasted fragrant and flavourful, was a little wet and hard to manage because the bread was very thin.  But I just got messy and dug my hands right in and it was worth it!  For dessert, I had the ALMOND BAKLAVA and the CHOCOLATE PLATE.  Amazing, I really enjoyed the chocolate plate, it was melted down dark chocolate with nuts and dried cranberries.  It was a great way to top off a meal.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Almond baklava, but that's only because I'm not a huge sweets fan, I did try some and the almond tasted fresh and fragrant.  It was more like a cake than like the traditional greek baklava that I'm used to eating.  All in all, the flavor was well-infused, fragrant and well put together.  I am extremely impressed with the ambiance and it was clean and cozy.  The service was amazing, the servers were attentive and informative.  I also had the fresh mint tea that hey made fresh for me, which was delicious.  All in all, a great experience, must go, right now."}
{"text":"Ate at Banu last week for Winterlicous. My friends and I were greeted warmly at the door by one of the servers and she promptly took us to our table. She took her time to explain the different dishes on the Winterlicous menu and answer and questions (friends were not familiar with Iranian food). I had the roasted eggplant appetizer. It has a strong flavor, very bold but appetizing. Kebabs for the main course were excellent and at par with what I've had in the Middle East (yes I know Iran really isn't part of the Middle Easy, but plenty of Iranian restaurants). The desert was okay and took over 45min to come. We had the rice pudding - very bland with no sense of flavor to it. Hence I'm taking out one star. Overall great experience and I would return."}
{"text":"Ive ate here a couple of times, and I must admit that the food quality and flavour is outstanding. The kabob torsh here was phenomenal. Must try.  The atmosphere is quiet unique and definitely unlike any other Iranian restaurant in Toronto that I have been too. It's got a tradition yet modern feel. Pretty cool concept.  The food portions are fair, but the price is a little higher compared to most other Iranian restaurants. Service is pretty fast and orders come out to your liking.   They do have hookah also I believe."}
{"text":"You know what, I'm usually a pretty nice guy when it comes to restaurants and lounges. Honestly, this place was below what I expected. Don't get me wrong, the ambiance was very lovely, but I must admit that the food, service, and shisha were less than desirable.   A good place to sit and chat, but they could be so much better if they improved a few minor things. The biggest issue was the shisha.  We were very disappointed. We're used to having a large shisha when we have four people. They gave us a tiny one...  At beat a 6/10, and that's only because I like the design of the place."}
{"text":"Banu was on my dine list for the longest time and all I can say that my experience has been just good. Nothing more and nothing else. Service was top notch especially when our server recommended the daily special which was Iranian pulao with chicken (highly recommend). It is only served on Saturdays. I also loved the Torsh and Kubbideh. The only downside of the place is that they compromise a lot on portion size. Every time I've dined at Iranian restaurants I always noticed the portion size of most dishes were never compromised, whether the place was expensive or a hole in the wall. However at Banu the food quantity served is comparatively less than what should be served for the price they charge. Again great place for quality and taste of food and the service but not the best when it comes to portion sizes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a waste of time and money. Don't spend your money there. They are so unprofessional and rude!!! the food was old and taste bad. I wouldn't go back there."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Just OK. Overpriced with so-so service. The food is good but the Shisha is very disappointing. Herbal only, burns fast and costs $21. It is ok for food but go elsewhere for shisha. There are also better Persian food options on College and in North York. I would not go again."}
{"text":"Great hidden jem! The ambience was great! We've been looking for a delicious Iranian restaurant for a long time. However as a group of 4 we ordered the Fam Jam ($100) which really was only enough for 2-3 individuals. We were all disappointed with the portions. The one skewer of beef and 2 skewers of chicken is not enough for 4 people.  We all agreed that if we were to go next time we would get individual entrees  Also felt it was slightly over priced"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 2.5.   The decor was nice.  Lots of room at the tables. Waiter was really nice and attentive but the place wasn't busy at all due to the weather. Our first meal which i thought was the Mast o Khiar but it may had been something different.  It was great for sharing and quite tasty. The 2nd dish which we also shared was the Laboo (oven roasted beets, sheep's milk cheese, fresh herbs and watercress.  I would return for this.  The beets are amazing. The 3rd dish Koobideh Loghmeh had a hair in it.  :(  It was a long hair.  The waiter had this dish remade for us and did not charge us for this. The Torsh was ok.  All items are easy to share. The hair found is disappointing and comping the meal and replacing the dish is the bare minimal that any restaurant would do.  But I think that finding that did set us off as we looked closely at the meal afterwards before eating."}
{"text":"Hmmmm..... ok. So. No. We had a party of 7, and we're stuck in the dim back-room. My boyfriend and I ordered two starters, and two mains. The mains were served on a big plate; for everyone to share...The other guests apparently didn't know that they had only ordered one meal, so they ate one and a half of ours. Happens when all of it is served on one big plate? My bf and I had two small pieces of meat each, and a couple of spoons of rice. I'm still hungry. I somehow thought our second meal would arrive! As the wine was $13 per glass, I decided to order a bottle instead for me and my boyfriend. Ordered it, went to the bathroom. Came back to my seat, and my glass was full. But the bottle was empty! The waiter had filled up everyone's glass, lol! Two different waiters who served us, spilled food on me. And then the bill came. For the one $61 bottle of wine of which we had two small glasses, one beer, two small glasses of wine, one starter, and basically 4 small kebab pieces: $250. They had generously awarded themselves a 20% tip which was added to the total bill. I don't mind paying well for good food and a bottle of good wine....if I get to eat it and drink it, and enjoy it in a nice place! Didn't happen. Sorry."}
{"text":"As modern Persian restaurants go, a very worthy attempt but falling short. What's good: the (hipster?) concept, menu, taste of almost everything on the menu. What's not: service (smile, people!), overpriced and the hipster concept! Somebody please tell them there's actual COFFEE (usually with chocolate) in a Cafe Glacé, not just a bit of syrup drizzled over store-bought ice cream.  Badly wanted to give these guys 5 stars and hope they survive and improve enough to one-day update my review, but for now, three-stars would have to do."}
{"text":"Service was friendly but became rather inattentive by the time I asked for the bill. There weren't that many people dining when I was there and it still took 10 minutes for the server to notice me and get my bill. Decor was beautiful and made me feel like I was in some trendy, timeless but contemporary restaurant in Iran. The stew that I had was filling and the lamb was tender. Prices were a bit on the higher side but aren't too bad, considering that the food was good. I look forward to coming back again. Hopefully the service would be better by the time I do come back."}
{"text":"I would like to update my review by letting fellow Yelpers know the owner of this restaurant (Samira M), instead of fixing the bad quality food and service offered at Banu is diligently responding to Yelper comments in a very disrespectful way here. Goes to show the kind of restauranteur she is. Feel free to read the post she did on mine and fellow Yelpers. Once again proving my point - Buyer be aware!"}
{"text":"Classy, calm atmosphere with beautiful Persian songs and delicious kebabs, food is pretty filling, non-greasy, yummy!! if you are in town for kebabs recommended, enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, to Banu. Food, drinks and service are about as good as it gets.   Banu bills itself as a Persian vodka bar. The second you're walking into the room you feel like you're in 1960's Tehran, sitting on low white leather couches and listening to Iranian pop music.   Despite the vodka bar tag, Banu is one of the few restaurants I frequent where I rarely order alcohol. That's mainly because I am addicted to their Pomegranate drinks and  the never ending mint tea that complements the food perfectly. With the curtains drawn and the hookah being smoked at the next table (don't worry, there is excellent ventilation and it never gets bothersome) you really feel that you're thousands of miles from Queen West.   The food is where Banu shines brightest. Meat is organic and well chosen. Kebabs in all their manifestations dominate the menu but vegetarians need not worry, there's plenty of non meat choices.   The food is incredibly fresh, juicy and flavourful. Mint, lemon and basil are dominant flavours, backed up by green olives and walnuts.Everything is served with a wonderful flatbread to mop up the juices.   Service is friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. For us, Banu is one of our favourite places in Toronto."}
{"text":"So I just moved to Toronto from Vancouver and was excited to try out some Persian restaurants here since Toronto has a much larger Persian population and probably has some good spots. I went out for dinner last night with my bf and he has never had Persian food. I suggested we try it out.  I come on yelp to help me find a spot downtown that could also possibly have hookah. If you type in Persian food or hookah bar in yelp Banu is the first place that pops up so I figured this is the place to go. Here are my thoughts: - Not authentic at all - The kabob plates don't come with rice (all kabob should come with rice) - each dish is 27 dollars and up (without rice might I add again) - the servers don't speak Persian (which is totally fine) but when I asked her if they had vaziri she looked at me angrily and said \"I don't speak Persian, speak English\" - they do not have hookah/shisha (maybe remove it off the site then lol)  If you want a modern style Persian tapas type of place then this is ur place, but for a nice Persian dinner definitely not and they do not have hookah"}
{"text":"Tried this place last month with my husband.  We are both Persian, so decided to try a new restaurant and we were so unhappy.   With my meal I did not get a tomato or any salad.  I had two tiny pieces of cut up chicken with rice. For 20 dollars!   My husband did not enjoy his meal either. We will not be going back, and I am thinking that these reviews have got to be fake or written by a 3rd party."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn writing this review b/c the food does not deserve 2 stars...probably a solid 3.5 stars.  This Iranian restaurant is tiny but lovely.  Great place for smaller groups.  We tried it out during Summerlicious and while busy I wouldn't say the restaurant was beyond crazy busy.  I started off with the watermelon salad which in the last few years has become one of my fave things to eat b/c it's so fresh tasting with dome savoury flavours to it (feta cheese, mint, spice mix).  My friend had the chilled cucumber soup and she really enjoyed it.  The reason for the lower star rating is the service.  We waited almost an hour for our main (chicken and rice).  I'm pretty sure the server forgot to put the order in and realized it later.  There is no way chicken and rice take almost an hour.  It was ok but a bit underwhelming.  Or maybe b/c we were so hungry that we almost ate our napkins we couldn't care less what it tasted like.  Desert was ok - I had the baklava, which is more of a dense sponge like cake made with rosewater.  A little heavy for me but ok.  It would have been perfect with a nice cup of tea.  Overall it took 2hrs from start to finish whereas it should have been only an hr meal.  Service was definitely slow, albeit pleasant.  I may decide to try this place again but I think there are definitely better Iranian restaurants out there."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are in Toronto. I visit my sister in Toronto during the summer, and we were allured here one Sunday. It was the highlight of the summer. I knew nothing about Persian food back then, but since then I have become very invested in it. It is by far my favorite cuisine by now.  Unfortunately, I do not live in Toronto, and have not been able to find Persian food that is even half as good as Banu's (Yes, nothing in NYC is as good as Banu, even though I've been to the Michelin guide recs here). Not to mention how gorgeous the decor is, and how thoughtful the service is.  When we went in, we had no idea what to order, but the waitress sat down with us to explain each dish to us and make great suggestions. She was super kind and super patient with people who knew nothing about it.  The food is AMAZING, especially the mast-o khiar yogurt, and the bareh torsh.  I have been here a good number of times now, and it never disappoints me. I find the portions here to be pretty big, my sister and I can barely finish our food, and we don't even order dessert. The tea is also great, excellent to finish your meal. The decor is gorgeous, and I really admire all the effort that goes to making the basement into a space where you learn more about the current situation of certain activists in Iran. The ambiance is relaxed and comfortable, no dress code or anything. It is clear to me how thoughtfully put together this place is, and how cuisine means a lot more than just \"service\" to the owners. By far my favorite restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Banu is hands down the best place I've been for Persian kebabs. I'd say Zaffron comes close, but I think they serve much better meat at Banu, and the chef there cooked them just right. Everything we had was really juicy and tasty. Banu only servers kebabs; you won't be able to get any Persian stews here. The meal was about $42 dollars each when all was said and done. (We split 8 orders of kebabs and a starter between 6 people; 3 of us ordered hard drinks, the others soft drinks.) Compared to other places I've eaten at, this is a deal, but compared to other Persian places its a bit pricey. (My wife and I both ate at Darvish for less.) That said, Banu really is a superlative Persian restaurant; I think it's worth splurging on. Banu a nice looking restaurant with great service and excellent food -- what else do you really need?  They also have a great selection of vodka, a big plus."}
{"text":"One of the things about randomly choosing a place is, you just never know.  You can read all the reviews but ultimately - until you try the food it's the unknown. LOL  This time around, I had a craving for middle eastern food.  I chose Banu based on its location to my next destination.  I am extremely glad to have gone there.  It was incredible!    I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with not only how full I felt but what I discovered from this food experience.  I ordered the Koobideh.  Two skewers of soft tender beef over naan served with fresh herbs (tarragon and basil), eggplant garlic, roasted tomatoes and sumac (a sweet herb you place over the beef to your liking).  I was advised by our server to combine all the elements to get the flavour of the food out. She was not kidding!  It made my mouth sing with happiness!     I also had it with a side of basmati rice. Though a simple side dish, it had a distinct flavour difference from say, a side of basmati at an Indian restaurant.   The food gave me a new appreciation of middle eastern food I had not experienced before.  I would even venture to say,  my best food experience in Toronto so far.  The only thing I would wish for, more choices on their menu.    This place is a strange mix.  It's modern and beautiful  on the other hand it has graffiti in the foyer and graffiti all over the bathroom.  Took me completely by surprise.  I haven't figured out to resolve that one in my brain yet.  You'll find Sook Yin Lee`s autograph on the foyer wall for those of you who are her fan's."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. By far one of the worst restaurants I have been to. The food took 1.5 hr to hit the table and I don't even want to comment on the servers. argh! Did I mention that they completely messed up the order. This restaurant is a perfect example of awful service and poor food. Save your money. To top it all they added a 17 pct service fee for such a shit show. Oh by the way, my sincerest advice to the manager would be to enroll herself in math 101 to learn how to split a bill. The server thought he was too cool to work in restaurant; constantly playing the blame game with the chef for screwing up the order.   Definitely a no go. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. If for some reason you still decide to venture out that way, refrain from ordering koofteh, murgh, kobedeh wrap, and some cashew porridge.  Enough said!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we were really looking forward to trying Banu since we just moved to this neighbourhood. We love Persian food and were delighted to find a local restaurant serving this cuisine. We ordered take out from here on a Friday night for 3 people. We all wanted to try the Koobideh full dinner but when we called the waitress said there are too many customers and we can only have one Koobideh in our order. Now I am not sure how it would make any difference to make one or make three. So we ended up ordering a full Koobideh, Torsh and Bareh dinner and medium rice. So the total came to about $90+tax and tip.   We made our way to pick up the order when they said it would be ready but had to wait about 15 mins. After we got home we were really surprised to see the portions and were really wondering how the medium rice would be enough for 3-4 people. It's rice, you don't need to be stingy on that. The food tasted pretty good so it was just a shame that we were still unsatisfied at the end of the meal with all three of us looking for something more to eat. I do have to mention that I never manage to finish my meals at any restaurant and always end up getting left overs to go.   If it were for the food alone this restaurant would have received 4 stars but the abysmal service and portion sizes left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my experience at Banu. I found it to be way overpriced. The food was pretty good, and the ambiance was unique, but the portions were very, very small. After spending nearly $50 for my share of dinner, I was still hungry. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The service was very good here and everyone was quite welcoming. The food however was only average. We got the eggplant dip with barbari bread, gheymeh stew with veal tenderloin and the chicken thigh. All the meat was very tender, but the flavours seemed alright. The price was definitely reasonable, but not sure I can justify a higher rating."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. I've never been to this restaurant and I don't plan on ever going. I've dealt with them over the phone and can truly say their customer service is lacking. I wanted to book our work Christmas party here, and was looking forward to it. However reached out to them to get a menu to decide. The person over the phone promised me twice (as I reached out to them twice) he will email me. I have yet to get an email from Banu. It's unfortunate because I was looking forward to introducing Persian food to my co workers. Please consider improving your customer service."}
{"text":"Banu is without a doubt one of the most unique restaurants in the city. The food is delicious and obviously high quality.   I got really trashed that night, so I don't really remember the names of the dishes, but the koobedeh was really tasty, and the testicles were just marvellous ;-)  I'm amused by all the yelpers comments complaining about service. To be honest, I see where they're coming from, but I don't think they \"get it\". I kind of appreciated the wacky personalities of the workers at Banu, it practically highlights their passion. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Great torsh kebab and sheepsmilk cheese app. Also hookah was very good - watermelon. Good wine as well - rhone. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"We love this place. 2 nd time there last night . Great friendly service , fantastic high quality food. The beef skewers are fantastic. Great ambience . We will defn be making this a regular dining spot ."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious with some friends, great experience! We all ordered something different, I loved the beet salad, and chicken kebab! Food was flavourful and portions were decent. Dessert however was a bit lacking (rice pudding was very dry).  For Iranian food this place can be a bit overpriced, if you're looking for something more rustic my friend recommends going to Pomegranate."}
{"text":"Everyone considering going to this restaurant should read Banu's response to Human E.'s post below. This is exactly the way you should expect to be treated by the extremely rude staff. [Although, to their credit... I would be cranky too if I was forced to work in a place that smelled like mildew and urinal pucks.]   Often I will even put up with bad service if the food is decent, unfortunately Banu failed to deliver on the food front as well. [Although, the long dark hair I removed from my Kabob really made the meal feel authentic.]   If they devoted as much attention to cleanliness/customer service, as they do to (judgmentally) tracking  the number of drinks their patron's consume it would be a significantly better experience.   Next time I be sure to find a restaurant that doesn't single me out on Yelp(!) for having more than one cocktail.   P.S. for the record, it was two gin and tonics.... and if they were doubles (which I didn't ask for) that gin was watered down."}
{"text":"cool restaurant. the experience was unique, especially with the Persian music being played in the background.   the food was delicious, especially the lamp chops. this was my first Persian food experience and it was great. the customer service was fantastic, especially when the food was served. i was with 3 other people. the food was served on one group plate, which made eating more fun.  the prices were a little expensive though. i think the restaurant is trying to be trendy by charging more. despite this, next time i'm in the area, i will eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent! On the word of a good friend we tried this Iranian/Persian Restaraunt while we were in Toronto. One visit turned into several to try most of the menu. Service was great, food excellent and ambience matched both. A definite must try and must return! And don't even get me started on their cocktails. Absolutely outstanding with excellence and creativity. Yum yum yum yum!! All of this and a sense of humor also.  WE LOVED THIS PLACE!! And couldn't get enough of it! Being from out of town we miss it already!"}
{"text":"Amazing Rivas stew ( summerlicious menu). I loved my drink as well: a perfect combination of gin and rose water syrup!!"}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised at the rating this place has. We ate at Banu last night and really enjoyed it. And I grew up eating Persian food and tend to be rather fussy about it!  First, yes, the portions aren't overwhelming like they tend to be at Persian restaurants - that's a hospitality thing in Persian culture but it does tend to lead to wasted food. That said, I'm a big guy, and was not hungry at the end of my meal.  My partner, who eats meat, got the qeymeh (a stew) and really enjoyed it. I got the spinach yogurt and Adasi (lentil) salad, and both were fantastic. They were served with triangles of toasted barbari bread. We also shared the kashk-e-bademjan (\"sour cream and eggplant\") and salad olivieh (Persian-style Russian potato salad) and they, too, were absolutely awesome. Between my partner and me, the plates were clean.  Our preschooler daughter enjoyed her koobideh loghmeh (basically a ground-meat kabob in lavash bread), and she can be a fussy eater.  For dessert we shared Persian ice cream (pistachio, rosewater, saffron) and a flourless chocolate cake with sour cherry preserves. Again, everything was spectacular.  We had the pomegranate wine which was more like a sangria (served with ice); it was a great accompaniment to the meal.  My only gripes were the lack of any vegetarian stews like ghormeh sabzi (although they did have rivas/rhubarb stew which I'm kicking myself for not ordering) or faloodeh, but frankly the 3-star rating here is so undeserved that I'm not dinging them for that.  The service was fantastic, and the pre-Revolutionary Iranian pop music was an awesome added touch!"}
{"text":"Stars are for the ambient only and also nice staff. Super small portions which is very funny to look at. Veryyyyyyy Expensive you pay for nothing. Beside we paid 18% tip on after tax bill for tables more than 5. And the policy is : no seperate bill Its all because of the 18% Bull shit"}
{"text":"Great food. Very nice service. Try grilled beef heart main and kaske bademjan appetizer"}
{"text":"One of the worst service i have been ever provided in the city of Toronto. The weightress was beyond rood. I know persian restaurants are very welcoming. Was very shocked with such an attitude. But the food was great. A bit pricy for the portion but still very tasty."}
{"text":"Banu was my first experience of Persian food in Toronto and although it started out a little awkward it ended wonderfully!  I'm from LA so ive seen it all when it comes to Persian restaurants, and I can say the decor in Banu was unique! The torquise-ness is nice, the picture of the beautiful woman behind the bar, and the wall full of signatures from famous people. Drake the rapper even signed the wall!!  As me and my friend had arrived on a flight the night before, we took the trolly here from our hotel for lunch. When we walked in, we were told that the chef had an emergency and he will be back in 20 minutes. We found this kind of weird, but we actually did some decent shopping on Queen street for a little while as it was our first time seeing this area.  When we got back from our quick shopping spree, we were greated with great service! I was unsure of what to order, and was given a sample of their \"Torsh\" kabob. It was so amazing we had to order it. I thought I had eaten it all, but apparently \"Torsh\" is a special recipe from the north of Iran which won't be found at your local Los Angeles Kabobii.  We ordered Koobideh and Torsh. It came with sides of yogurt and lavash bread. The meat was very tender and good. You could really tell the quality of meat being used was top notch. I'm not sure what kind of yogurt it was that was served on the side, but it was very similar to mast-o-mousir. It added an extra kick to the kabob we were eating.  To add to the amazing food was the service we got. I think our hosts named was Salumeh (not sure). But she was amazing and made us feel at home. She accommodated us with backgammon boards and made us feel comfortable with unfamiliar food. Her genuineness and aura made our experience at Banu a great one. She also recommended a Persian Play for us to go to later on that week (\"Mahmoud\" and we went and it was great). I wish i could thank her for her great service, hope she sees this. She seemed like an all around amazing person and felt like more than just a host or server.  I noticed numerous amount of other reviewers complaining about the price. I did kind of find the the prices high, but you get what you pay for. Not only great food, but a great experience. I have already recommended this restaurant to friends around the world who make frequent trips to Toronto since people think highly of my critique on food. I look forward to my next trip to Toronto to have another experience here."}
{"text":"Edited due to Owner response: A phrase that is very commonly used in Persian society and very appropriate for this situation- 'Javabe ablahan khamooshi hast'   Original Review: Food is not bad but expensive IMHO. The atmosphere is not that of a Persian restaurant really. The chairs were not the most comfortable to sit on given they are more tailored to looking good than being comfy. The sisha/water pipe/hubbly bubbly service was quite weak relative to other establishments. They had to replace the waterpipe 3 times and there were still issues with it. I hope my experience was a one time glitch but if its Persian food you are looking for there are better options."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was so good. The place is very nicely decorated and the service was fast and very friendly. I got the Koobideh Loghmeh and i loved it, it was sooo tasty. The portions aren't huge but it seems a good place to get a number of starters to share and then maybe a main dish. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious but we were very surprised at the portions. We barely got any rice with either of our main dishes. We ordered the olives which for $14 should have come with some sort of side bread (usually olives are less than half the price at more fancy Persian restaurants). We finished all of our food and we're still hungry. There was barely any rice given which we have never encountered at any Persian restaurant. For the price they charge they should at least give you a decent amount of rice. Everything was tastey but do not go there if you want to get full on less than $100."}
{"text":"We just got home from enjoying a $25 Summerlicious dinner at Banu and I can't stress enough how much I think you should get on the phone and make a reservation there. It was truly AMAZING.  First off, sometimes during Summerlicious the food at restos is just 'meh', and the service even worse. Tonight, the food was great, and the service was really incredible.  For starters, hubby had the Salad Olivieh - an Iranian style potato salad that was so flavourful and really unique with the pickles added. I had the Adasi lentils, which had such a bright flavour full of lemon and parsley - yum.  For our mains, we ordered the Murgh chicken breast and the Chenjeh chunks of beef tenderloin. Maybe because I'd never tried Iranian food before, I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was 2 skewers of perfectly moist, tender grilled meat, served with abundant flatbread, yogurt/garlic sauce, a dish of ground spices, and some mint and basil leaves. You take a little of each, make yourself a small packet with the flatbread, and pop it in your mouth - OMG - so so good. It was great to see the chefs cooking your skewer in the open kitchen as well.  For dessert, hubby ordered the SOMA Chocolate Plate and I ordered the Almond Baklava Cake. Some other diners suggested the chocolate (plus ordered more to take home!) and I'm so glad we took their recommendation - it really was an amazing blend of flavours. Plus the cake was much more than I expected - a perfect blend of honey, cake and pistacios.  Add that to the mint tea we requested, and I was in what I think might be Iranian food heaven. The mint tea was served in our own pot with traditional small glasses along with a few little dessert treats on a silver tray. Just awesome.  They have a great vibe, there's a small private area upstairs, the staff are friendly, knowledgeable and really helpful - I can't wait to go back. Starting to think about whether my birthday party might be at Banu this year!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Persian food I've had! Seats were very comfortable. Wasn't crazy about those rectangle plates. And it's a little pricey... Should be 3 $, not the two."}
{"text":"My experience at Banu was nothing short of excellent. It is by far the best Iranian food i've had including Iran itself. You could taste the quality of the ingredients.  The service was on point, attentive, descriptive, and comfortable. I'm just disappointed in myself for not having come here sooner.  What's really disturbing however is the mixed reviews on here and responses that makes me want to not bother with coming back.   In Banu's defence, i think the price is absolutely worth it. At an average of $25 an entree, this is comparable to any italian restaurant or even chain restaurant in terms of price....and i feel you get more for your money here.  But in a lot of the Yelp community's defence here.....calling out reviewers like that is just not good business, and not nice as a moral human being. You can't mould your customers to be who you want them to be just as you can't do that to any of your friends."}
{"text":"We walked by the other day and decided to give it a try :) my boyfriend is Persian and his mother is a decent cook, so we are a little spoiled when it comes to Persian cuisine :)  We took the Kubideh and the herb stew. The Kubideh was extraordinary delicious, the herb stew too sour unfortunately. Service was also really really great and fast in bringing the food, beverages and always checked on us if we needed anything. We definitely had a great stay here! 4 stars because it's a little pricy... See pictures for more details on the food :)"}
{"text":"I love banu. The kabab's are always the best options.the cocktails are good too. Tonight we booked a table for 7,but although we changed it to 6:30,they were so accommodating and the service was great too. I ordered the vegetarian dish,pomegranate wine, and shole zard, my big ordered beets salad, koobideh(lovely) and ice cream. All great as always. I am Persian and know good quality kabab, and banu never disappoints. Both owners are always friendly and nice and I think the service has improved significantly during the past 3 years. The portion since is also better now, specially since it's served with basmati rice. They brought us Persian tea at the end, on house and it was a great ending to a delightful dining experience."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars. The food is fantastic - like, really good - the location is great, the ambiance is nice, and the servers (at least the female server I had) are pleasant and efficient. But I came during Winterlicious and they added a compulsory %15 tip (AFTER tax) to my bill. Excuse me? Since when does a restaurant dictate to me what I tip? Let alone forcing me to tip OVER the standard, which is 15% on the PRE-TAX amount. I asked the male server about it and he said it's something they do during Winterlicious because \"We have problems.\" This does not satisfy me as an excuse for what is basically a dictatorial, money-grubbing practice. If I want to tip, I'll tip. If not, you have no right to force me. When I asked why they had calculated the tip on the post, not pre-tax amount, he looked uncomfortable and couldn't provide any answer.  Sadly, this left such a terrible taste in my mouth after what was otherwise a pleasant experience that I probably won't go back. Too bad.  UPDATE in response to Samira M's comments below--  1) Yes, it's true that the compulsory gratuity was noted on the menu. Doesn't make it right though!  2) I will most likely be back because, as I noted, the food and service were very good. Especially the food. Yum.  3) Please note, Samira, that there is no such thing as a \"minimum gratuity\" when dining unless the restaurant chooses to impose one. Tipping is, and always has been, OPTIONAL. There is no law that says a customer has to tip.  4) Similarly, the suggestion that 15% \"was the standard 25 years ago\" simply makes no sense. Yes, it was the standard 25 years ago, and it still is today. Are you suggesting that the rate of tipping should increase with the rate of inflation, increasing by 2% every year? By that logic, the average tip in 2012 should be 55% of the bill. In another 25 years, the \"standard tip\" would be 100% of the bill. Huh? The standard tip is the standard tip and this does not change, which everyone except Toronto's restaurant owners seems to understand."}
{"text":"Came here for a date for summerlicious. Given the location and area - we chose this place for the type of food and location. We arrived and the decor is nice. We were served promptly with the waitress offering water. We order off the summerlicious menu where the options was pleasing to the eye. We got our app fairly early where the question was what happened after that ? We had to wait for our main for over a 1/2 hour where I believe they may have mistaken the table after us with our main. The food was tasty as we had the kebobs, and stew for the mains. The flavours were on point. The only reference to the dishes is the dessert was not as appealing as they were described. The kebobs were my favourite as I enjoy a good piece of grilled meat.   Overall the experience was satisfying."}
{"text":"Banu can be ranked as one of the worst Persian places in the town. The portion size of their dishes was surprisingly much smaller than a usual Iranian dish served in the town. This place was very expensive in spite of their small portion size.  The food quality was also bad. I had never seen such low quality rice being served at any Iranian restaurant. We ordered Ghormeh Sabzi and Bareh Torsh. The stew was very salty and contained not enough meet in it. Bareh Torsh portion size was also very small and not delicious.  I don't recommend anyone to dine there for food."}
{"text":"Have you ever paid $60 and left a place hungry?!!!  Well I have!  Lets with the positive: it tasted...good.  However, it was waaaaaaaay overpriced for the small portions. I was gonna ask where the rest was!! Ordered a full chenjeh and 'half' a bareh with no rice! (Which Persian restaurant do you know where you have to order rice separately?!! And for $6!) it came with half a grilled tomato, two leaves of basil and mint. The shallot yoghurt was one tablespoon! I was thinking of ordering yoghurt as an appetizer but it was $12! Seriously?! No thank you.  I wouldn't categorize this as a restaurant but a snack bar. Way overpriced which is not even justified. The atmosphere is meh, the washrooms are third world. Even if it is organic there's no reason for it to be this expensive!  Btw, this is the first time i'm writing any review for any place. It was that bad that I needed to go out of my way, download this app to write this essay."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service was really warm the first time I went, and since then has \"cooled\" a bit down. They're still nice though. The vodka drinks are quite delicious. I find the phrase where they explicitly state that they don't serve rice to be a bit angry but funny at the same time. I don't eat rice so whatevs. I LOVE the appetizer with the sheep cheese, herbs and sour cherry jam thing. It's absolutely delicious. Since I first went they appear to give more cheese, which is good, because they would skimp on the cheese before. Their kebabs are absolutely delicious. I'm disappointed that they changed their provider from the Healthy Butcher to Cumbrae's. They're trying to tell me that it's still organic but every time I go to Cumbrae's they never sell organic meat, just naturally raised. I think they're mistaken. It's unfortunate because their prices don't reflect these changes, as Cumbrae's is cheaper and lower quality than the Healthy Butcher (but I love the HB so I'm partial to them I suppose). All of the flavours are just right at this place. They really know how to combine different ingredients to blow your taste buds away. They are very impressive. Nice place, just don't sit too close to the washroom... but if you need to go to the washroom, it'll warm your heart to know you can write all over the walls with sidewalk chalk."}
{"text":"Very double minded about this place! The place is gorgeous, the waitress was very nice and friendly, great atmosphere and great food but THERE WAS TOO MUCH SALT! We got a gheymeh and a ghorme sabzi but we couldn't finish any of them. The taste of both would have SO MUCH better without! I would've given this place a 10 out of 5 if there was less salt!"}
{"text":"We went today for Summerlicious lunch ($15)   The decor of this place is great, I'd probably go back for a drink one evening just to experience it in the evening hours, I bet it looks incredible.   As mentioned in other posts, the service here was 100%, VERY good. Our server topped up our waters, brought extra bread when we asked, was super friendly and was knowledgeable about the menu.  The food was really unique and very flavorful, but we were disappointed with the portions.   I realize this is lunch, but the appetizers were tiny and the mains came with a small meat portion with no veg or anything on the side. My friend's lamb chops, for example, were two tiny little 1oz pieces of meat and nothing served with them besides small \"flat bread\" which is a small paper thin square like an egg-roll wrapper.  I think I had too high expectations for Banu after reading other yelper reviews. But overall, this place has great food, ambience, service; the works.  Would be great for a date!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend went for Summerlicous here. Food was good! Their kabobs are awesome! We got baklava for dessert and it was alright, nothing special.  Service was average. They were friendly and helpful but it was just two of them and a lot of the food took quite a while to come out and quite often we found ourselves with empty glasses of water for a while.  Overall, would recommend to try once, but probably won't go there again."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. Don't expect a high level of service when dining in and make sure your order is correct when getting take out."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good! The food was beautiful. Just beautiful. The service was great too. What else can I say? Beautiful!"}
{"text":"Based of the reviews I can see a lot of inconsistency in this restaurant. Luckily for me I had a good experience.   The food is pricey. But let's face it, it's downtown Toronto and it's a dine-in restaurant. I could see the same food being 50% the price in a take out restaurant in the suburbs - try there if you aren't satisfied with pay $30 for kabobs.  We ordered the Salad E Shirazi, Kashk E Bademjan, Koobideh and Torsh kabobs. All of the food tasted delicious. The kabobs and sides were served on a sharing platter. Koobideh comes with 2 skewers while Torsh was only 1. The sides were saffron rice and grilled tomatoes, and we asked for bread as well.  Service was great. All of the food arrived quickly and the waitresses were friendly. The restaurant wasn't very busy however, which may have worked in our favour."}
{"text":"The food is way too overpriced for the portion you get. The rice was salty and my friend found a piece of hair in his koobideh dish."}
{"text":"Went again lastnight.  It wasnt busy for a Tuesday night but the service was excellent!  The food is great and is made to be shared!  Its good for groups!  Smoked Mint Chocolate Shisha MMmm...  The best part was that they dont have a \"set time\" that they close. They told us they close when people stop coming !!   I think i might throw my birthday party there next week! :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely abysmal service! Inflated prices seem to match the inflated egos of the owner/wait staff.   They have a very heavy-handed condescension about them which made everyone at our table very uncomfortable. Additionally, charging extra for coal on a shisha is absolutely ridiculous, especially when they only have 2-3 flavours available from their long list of 'advertised' flavours.   Food is not bad, but the portions were so small for the price. It is as if they confuse small portions for an avante-garde experience, but forgot that people also want to eat.   Would recommend many other restaurants for shisha and Irani food. Avoid."}
{"text":"I went to Banu for dinner, the restaurant is small with a unique style. The staff were all very polite and we never waited too long for anything. The food seemed to be fresh and prepared nicely. However, the reason this review is only getting two stars is because the portion sizes are extremely small for the price you pay.   We had their salad which consisted of 6-7 long pieces of romaine and a crumble of cheese, all for $13. The mains were also priced extremely high, for a small portion of protein and a side of grilled tomato and mint you're paying $23-29. Overall we spent $100 on food alone for two people. If they want to serve smaller portions then they need to price their dishes accordingly.   Though the meal was good I would not return to pay that much for so little."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for this place because like the other reviews mention, it's overinflated prices for half decent food.  It tastes fine but no wow factor - making it really not worth eating a meal here. Pictures can speak louder than words in regards to their ridiculously stingy portions. We paid for almost $60 for an appetizer and two half portions of skewers."}
{"text":"Up until this week I have never considered writing a Yelp review, but after my experience at Banu I felt compelled to sign up and share my experience. We visited the restaurant after coming across the Summerlicious menu which looked delicious and a great price for $15 per person.  The restaurant was very quiet when we arrived but I think it was coming to the end of lunch so I don't think this was a representation of the usual atmosphere of the place. The decor and music was all very authentic and we were greeted at the door and taken to our seats in a reasonable manner. The service in general was just fine, nothing out of the ordinary but also nothing to complain about really. The food was delicious, and was delivered in a timely fashion, we weren't left waiting for very long between courses. We would definitely recommend the Koobideh if anyone decides to go there. However, what we experienced as we were about to leave was nothing short of unbelievable and meant that this potential 4/5 star review has to go down as a 2. We paid for our order on card but accidentally pressed the wrong button and didn't leave a tip. We realized our mistake so asked to put a tip on the card afterwards. The waitress was okay with this and put it through, no problem. However, I think the owner or manager must have seen what was going on and reprimanded the member of staff right in front of us. What felt to us like a minor issue turned in to a full blown rant from the owner/manager who then told the waitress to leave and never come back.  Understandably this was more than a little awkward for us as we were still at our table while this was going on and feel partially responsible for what happened. This has tainted our entire experience and mirrors some of the reviews I have since read on here about how this woman speaks to her staff.  So all in all food was fantastic, a great culinary experience, but the inappropriateness and unprofessional manner at which the waitress was spoken to is just unacceptable to me and I would not be inclined to eat here again for this reason."}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot. My go-to for tasty protein! You can't go wrong with their char-grilled items like the well-seasoned Koobideh and lamb chops. The koobideh kabob is the best - so tender and juicy, it's the perfect compliment to the roasted tomatoes and herbs! Far better than Pomegranate on College...hands down heartier and more flavourful."}
{"text":"From a couple of years ago...Persian Food!!  I got the LENTIL SALAD - with yummy  green onion, with fresh zesty lemon tasted so fresh.  I also had BUCKWHEAT NOODLE POTAGE - was like a delicious stew with bread.  Try their ground angus sirloin kabob, they  put it on the plate together with wraps where we could wrap it ourselves.  Toppings included fresh rosemary and mint leaves, yogurt dip, grilled tomato"}
{"text":"Went out for a tea w/ a friend. Tea was ok but a little  bit pricey $5.00. Cool and bright inside."}
