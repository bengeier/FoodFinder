{"text":"We went to JT's based on a recent article on the Cleveland area's best diners in Cleveland Magazine.  It's a 12-table restaurant with a small counter area as well, situated in what looks like a renovated house.  They serve typical diner fare at very low prices, and it was packed at 10 a.m. on the Sunday morning we arrived.  The owner is a very loud, and at the time very pregnant, woman who is known for being terse with customers in a friendly manner - their slogan is \"East and Get Out, Dork!\"  And with seating for only about 30 people total, you can understand why they want turnover ... campers cost them money.  Within about 3 minutes of sitting down at the counter, the owner was there asking what we wanted, and she wanted an answer right then.  I didn't mind the rushed atmosphere, or the shouting - it's a small enough place that the owner, the kitchen staff and many of the regulars converse with each other by shouting across the room.  My partner, on the other hand, found it a little to rushed and a lot too noisy.  All in all the food was fine - I got eggs and pancakes and he got biscuits with gravy.  The food was exactly what we had imagined it would be and tasted perfectly fine, and the bill was only $9 (before tip) for a very filling meal.  I'd give this place 4 stars, but I wanted to be circumspect about the difficulty getting a seat and the loud, busy atmosphere - some people might not care for that.  Still, I'm a fan of local color, and this place has it.  If you want to eat somewhere that is unique to Northeast Ohio, and you have no place better to be than Willoughby on a weekend morning, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot!! Food is always delicious and on point! Love the atmosphere, service and everything is very reasonable. Tina (the owner) very engaging with customers. If your on the sensitive side, this is not the place for you.  Absolutley love this place!!"}
{"text":"Best place for good food fast! If you got shit to do and your hungry come here I love the new place and the owner is always graciously lovely! I would have posted my breakfast but I ate it so fast I forgot!"}
{"text":"Always great food with funny staff.  Bring your sense of humor or stay out!"}
{"text":"Foods fast and amazing. Hilarious place to go start your mornings. The owner Tina is great. One of the best diners in north east Ohio. By far."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some eggs at lunch and we did not want to go to a chain. We arrived to find most of the tables full.  I took this as a good sign.  Sat a a roomy booth.  Server came by with menus I ordered an omelette.  It came to the table hot and filled with everything I like.   Potatoes were crispy. We were in and out in under 30 minutes.  This was an added bonus due to the travel to get to Jt's from my work.   As I looked at what other people were eating the meatloaf looked amazing. I may be tempted to try it on my next visit."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, quick service, tasty food, and super reasonable prices.  They refilled my coffee cup so many times that you couldn't drain it an inch!  My wife loved the strong coffee too:)  Will come here again next time we are around!"}
{"text":"Large portions, low prices, and speedy service. Oh, and there's Tina"}
{"text":"Just recently ate at the new location did a fantastic job simply awesome in there.  Luckily was not too busy the day we went it was on a weekday about 1030 got in right away. Great service great atmosphere  Great prices.   But on the flipside in my  opinion the food is just OK nothing to write home about actually I think the food is a little bit better at the Lakeshore eatery up the street keep in mind I'm talking only about breakfast.  The main thing that attracts people to JT is the price I got an omelette and coffee for six dollars very inexpensive.   I went back there on Saturday to take my wife and show her but it was so busy we could not even get into the parking lot. Like I said before the food is just average and there's no way I'm going to wait in a line for average food so we turned around and went to the restaurant up the street for breakfast no wait excellent food and the waitress actually said thank you have a nice day instead of being rude."}
{"text":"It was amazing and the owner is hilarious. If you are sensitive don't go. Life is to short to not enjoy a great laugh."}
{"text":"Was my first trip to JT's and I will be back.  Food and service was very good for lunch!"}
{"text":"AWESOME food at an even better price! Fantabulous service with an attitude!! Quaint cozy atmosphere. If you want a home cooked breakfast or lunch, this is the place."}
{"text":"This place is nice.  The food is pretty good but not great. I had a gyro omelette and it was over  filled with tzatziki sauce.  That was too much for me.  You can have some fun with he help.  The like to harass you in a fun way."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming here for years. Teena  is the owner and server. If you read some reviews people will say that shes, loud, obnoxious and rude. She might be all those things but like she says \"If you don't like it then go to Bob Evans\". She will take away your cell phones, Ipods or any other gadget and tell you to talk with the people at your table. I think its awesome! Food is great and the price is even better."}
{"text":"Quick, simple, and wholesome. For a quick, cheap breakfast or lunch, you can't really beat this place. Only complaint... Coffee could have packed more of a punch."}
{"text":"A classy place with great food and excellent service. Never had a bad experience and always left satisfide.  The Eggs Benedict is superb. This place serves generous portions of food. Hooray for their new place!!"}
{"text":"I was a little nervous to try this place since I constantly heard how rude they are. With in 2 minutes it's quite clear that the rudeness is just a joke and theyre very sweet people. Our server had me in tears I was laughing so hard.the \"rudeness\" is all in good fun.   The food was decent especially for the price. It came out quickly and our service was great. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice diner!!!  Good food, fast service!!!  My only complaint is that the direction of the parking lot is backwards. You should enter on the right side of a building. Owner must be left handed. Haha"}
{"text":"Fun place!  Waitress was hilarious....but a really bad singer!  Fun was good especially the breakfast sausage!  Great prices!"}
{"text":"Everything a great diner should be and is .... loud sometimes, but service and food are first class... highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place was great! Yummy breakfast! Gals that work there are awesome! Great sense of humor! Everything came out fast and hot! Great service! Cheap!"}
{"text":"If you like a place that is commercialized and boring, do not come! Place seats about 30, and no tables were open so my BF and I sat at the bar! Quick and fast service!  Tina was hilarious! I ordered and then my BF ordered like 2 plates worth of food. She called him a fatty and said he better eat it all. He did and she laughed and stuck the bull down his shirt!   We had a fun time and delicious breakfast! Definitely loved the sarcastic humor Tina has and will return!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is good! The omelettes are good size, coffee is hot and plentiful, and prices are awesome! My only complaint is the toaster must be on the lowest setting - it comes out barely hot but my husband loves his toast that. Other than that, we've never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"The food here is reasonably priced and usually pretty good..  unfortunately the last few times I have been there I got to go orders and got home to find hair in my food.  Whoever is cooking needs to wear a hair net get it together because there's nothing worse than getting home and having to throw your money out. Probably won't eat here for awhile if ever.."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! Awesome service and fun atmosphere and the food is always delicious and inexpensive.   Update: IGNORE the negative comments. This place is incredible. The owner is hilarious. I love when she sings happy birthday. Anyone who can't handle the sarcasm and humor is a total pussy. Take your boring ass to Denny's."}
{"text":"Sorry food was just ok, felt rushed...I can deal with rude but really? How do they what mood you are in or feelings that day. I decided to try with brothers on a somber day for us dealing with illness in family and such. We just wanted breakfast and some coffee. They just wanted to flip table.... we'll stick with Bob Evans where we talk and relax and not be comically insulted. If it's your thing this is the place."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have been going here for a few years and absolutely LOVE this spot! Great people and fast delicious food every time. The owner is hilarious and always makes for a great laugh! We especially love the new spot! Still the same great food only this time delicious bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"My wife had a ob baby check up this morning at 9:15 so we decided to head over to jt's to grab breakfast beforehand. I have been to jt's a few times a long time ago at the old location at the end of lost nation rd. This was our first time at the new location. Very nice inside spacious great booths very roomy (they could use padding as it hurts your butt a little). My wife got French toast with a side order of hashbrowns and I got a cup of coffee(was really good and mellow not bitter at all) as well as a veggie omelet with rye toast and hash browns, my omlet was not bad but it was what it was a omlet. What I really enjoyed was my hash browns. nice chunks of potatoes that make make me think of pillows. Nice crispy out sides. My 2 year old son was making a mess and tossing plastic coffee cups and silverware on the floor and the owner was totally cool with it. It gets a bit loud in there and I heard words like dork loser and sush being said but that is just what this place is and I'm good with that. We spent about 14$ for breakfast and that includes our tip. I recommend coming here diffenetly if you live in the area. oh and one last note I asked her to only fill my coffee cup on half way and her response was do not tell me what to do lol made me chuckle at 8 am"}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner is awesome. She filled my mouth with whipped cream as she was walking past me. The best hangover wake up ever. The food is absolutely delicious the coffee is delicious even the god damn water is delicious. I love it. She's the best"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot!! The staff feels like family. I love the chocolate chip pancakes with bacon."}
{"text":"Cheap breakfast food done right. Nothing special, just exactly what you need and nothing you don't. They were not overly rude like past reviewers have stated, but maybe that's just because I'm a good customer. My theory is if you are a bad customer you get bad customer service. It's simple"}
{"text":"Soggy and cold waffles, mediocre bacon and \"stuffed\" pancakes that have the stuffing on the outside. Next!"}
{"text":"Great breakfasts at reasonable prices complemented by the wonderful ambience of owner, Tina, who always has a friendly hello for old and new patrons alike! Love that she has my order committed to memory too! Have been going here for years and highly recommend for a quick, inexpensive, great breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Great place , wonderful food, good price . Love it est here alot. Could not be better."}
{"text":"We have gone back numerous times since my last review and I must say my opinion has changed. The food is still great and the owner is still hilarious and awesome but the atmosphere, which I criticized last time, has grown on me. The culture of the restaurant is unique if it's your first time there. Imagine going to a family reunion where everyone is yelling at one another in jest and rolls are being thrown by your crazy grandpa. That is JT's diner. The staff sucks you in like your part of their family, which can be a little off putting the first time you are there. However, once you go a few times, you realize that the staff just wants you to enjoy your self and feel at home. Well,  guess what JT's - mission accomplished. I will definitely be going back again and will be recommending you to many more people!"}
{"text":"I would compare this place to Denny's, but less good food and more unpleasantness. If you are unopposed to being yelled at in the morning, by all means visit JT's. I have been there one time and will never go again. Maybe I'm too sensitive? Or maybe I'm just too polite?  Two of us walked in, asked for a table and were promptly yelled at by the waitress who had us share a table with two girls mid-meal.  The waitress told us it was THAT kind of restaurant and if we didn't like it then too bad. Being shy, I didn't complain or say anything to her. I ordered as quick as possible to keep the conversation to the minimum. The space was crowded and uncomfortable. All I'm saying is that if you are okay with loudness and rudeness, you will fit in just fine. I beg of you, DO NOT bring your shy girlfriend in for breakfast. She will not have a good time. Sigh."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome and funny, was in town for the boat races and came for breakfast. The owner Tina is the funniest owner/waitress I've ever met (and cute, as is all the girls). She started breaking our balls as soon as we came through the door. Food was really good, I can't wait to visit again next year, see ya then Dorks ;-)"}
{"text":"JT's invites you to enjoy a menu of many simple choices in two manageable, plastic coated pages. Waffles and breakfast food and a flip of the menu later you are greeted by pot roast, goulash and a panoply of sandwich choices.  Grabbing a seat at the counter near the kitchen, my waitress greets me in a t-shirt that good-naturedly invites me to \"Eat and get out, Dork!\"  Service is swift and exact, as my double cheeseburger arrived in less than five minutes during a Thursday lunch rush.  The meat is juicy and beautifully seared, the cheese melted into each nook and cranny without leaving the patty, and the veggies are crisp and cold.  Fries were crisp, hot and tasty, but clearly from the freezer.  My only complaint?  When you make a burger this good, don't cheap out on the bun, which is instantly overwhelmed by the heat and moisture from the meat, with the bottom falling apart by the third bite, forcing me to flip the sandwich to finish.  (First world problems, right?)  The clientele this day is a mix of construction workers, laptop workers and regulars, judging from the familiarity the staff shows towards most patrons.  Cleanliness = Superb Organization = a place for everything  Speed = Rapido! Taste = **** out of 5, echoed by my countermates who ordered a Philly and another burger"}
{"text":"JT's diner is a blast with good food for very cheap. Tina, the owner and waitress is over the top. She shouts at customers, insults them, tweeks their nipples now and again and they love it! If you are uptight or conservative this is probably not your place. If you love banter with a funny broad who won't take your sh!t, then this is all you! Try the eggs benedict. It is the best. And protect your nipples."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast spot in Lake County! Been going here for years and now with the new location its even better. Great service, food, amazing food and always consistent! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wasn't able to get over the extremely loud din of customers (try some sound proofing, people) let alone the make-my-head-vibrate screeching voice of the proprietor. Rude, perhaps, is one thing - but downright mean is another. Unless they're serving crack with their food I can't figure out why people continue to go there. Just mho."}
{"text":"A great place for the family to go for a quick morning breakfast. Very fun atmosphere, the kids will love it! The waitress (the only waitress) is so funny! Don't go if you don't like people who yell or have a big sense of humor. I have been going there for quiet some time now and enjoy going so much. This is my favorite place to eat breakfast. They also do serve lunch later on, but they close after lunch time. Otherwise, enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had the best breakfast today and we love Tina 2 ate for 18.18 Have a good new year"}
{"text":"JT's Diner slogan is \"East and Get Out, Dork!\" so if you lack a sense of humor avoid this place! Always yummy food at very reasonable prices. The best biscuits and gravy. Fresh homemade soups,awesome onion rings and burgers- your order is cooked quickly and to perfection. It's a small place and tons of fun. For an adventurous soul try this place, you'll really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The only thing wrong with JT's Diner is they are not open 24 hours. If they were I would be there all the time. I have only had the breakfast and it's fantastic, and they make it fast. From the time you sit down to the time you pay the check is less than 30 minutes. They always bring my food in less than 10 minutes. So if you're in a hurry this is the place to be.   **warning** the \"T\" in JT Diner stands for Tina. And make no mistake she is the queen bee! Her motto \"eat and get out\". If you don't mind being yelled at and told to shut up then this is your place. Wow! A MUST try without a doubt. But hurry, they close at 2pm!"}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and helped each other out. Food just eh. Sliced cheese in and on omelet, huge chunks of potaoes and barely warm toast. Did not see the rudeness routine but there were lots of signs on the walls. Owner was cleaning right next to us so all we could smell was cleaning solution."}
{"text":"Really great foods. Came here on last Saturday for breakfast. And you can't beat their price anywhere else. Beside the foods n the price, they have super great lady who was so friendly. I just love how friendly she is n she just makes you feel so welcome. I will be back since this is a place my brother n his wife love to go. Thank you for amazing foods."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place to eat breakfast!  Teena is awesome....she looks nothing like, but totally reminds me of \"Flo\" from the old sitcom Alice.  Nothing like having a great mean and then being told to \"GET OUT DORK\"!"}
