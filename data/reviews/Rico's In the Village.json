{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant in the heart of the Village! My husband and I went to Rico's for our anniversary dinner.  We had several different dishes, was hard to choose though! They were all so delicious, fresh, and just the right amount of spice/seasoning. The roasted potatoes and to die for! Service was excellent and our dishes were always promptly removed when we were done. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Rico's was a fun place to have a few drinks and a meal.  My wife and I have been twice now, once for an anniversary, and once with a group of 6 friends.  Both times we have been pleasantly greeted, seated, waited on, and served.  For those that dont know, this is a TAPAS house - everything is served with the intent to share, there are no full size entrees on the menu.  The Proscuitto wrapped asparagus is great & the shrimp amazing!  Great accessable wines to fit whatever youve chosen.  The chef is outgoing and happy to take feedback.  Once he came to our table and asked us if we would sample something new he was working on for a future menu - free of charge!  Overall, great small location adds character, staff is friendly, would recommend to anyone - but make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Well we have eaten some places... Never have we ever in a long time had something so tasty, so delicious and so delectable. My recommendation eat what ever you can it's all sooooo good... O desert was so delicious I had 2. Rico and Nicole were fantastic, very friendly and extremely nice. We booked again for valentines weekend. Sooooo impressed at this hidden gem..."}
{"text":"Great little out of the way spot .....  food is different and very enjoyable ....  service is top notch .....  restaurant is very small so you should make reservations. I enjoyed all the dishes I chose.  Certainly worth the trip."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Rico! Are you single? Alas, I am not but I felt like I was cheating a bit as your cooking won me over and tugged at my heartstrings!  This place was recommended to us by a couple of people. My husband is Spanish and we love tapas style dining. I have gotten wayyy better at sharing my food as this new genre of food has made its way into so many communities!  Wed night - we did not have a reservation (recommended to have one esp. on weekends) but the 4 of us were seated upstairs in this house converted into a restaurant. (there is parking to the rear)  It was said that the house is the 2nd oldest in Airdrie! The decor was simple with Latin influence and I liked the paint colors up and down in the different rooms. On the upper level there are 2 separate spaces that would accommodate private parties of 6-8 people nicely. The Spanish music really made the atmosphere, it was wonderful.  Now for the good part - the FOOD! WOW! We each chose a tapas plate and vowed we would all share fairly. The plates are staggered so that you get the plates at different times. The chef is made aware of how fast or slow a particular table is to gauge food delivery!  We ordered a bottle of Chilean red wine (they were out of 'Fat Bastard' our company's first choice), white wine and Estrella beer from Barcelona. All good!  Soup of the day was a potato and corm chowder, really good. Baby roasted Potatoes with a lovely dipping sauce. Chorizo and Sirloin skewers - needed 2 orders for 4 people. Worth it! Steak was cooked med.rare, chorizo very good quality. Portobello mushroom, stuffed. Served nice and hot, beautifully done. Stuffed jumbo shrimp (my choice!) OMG, stuffed with jalapeno and goat cheese. MMM Pulled pork on crostinis. Melt in your mouth excellent! Dessert Trio which are said to come from a local bakery. The white cheesecake was my fave! Everything was well seasoned!  The sauces that are served with the dishes are mind blowing.  TIP Make sure you try the green peppercorn one if you can! They need to bottle that stuff up for sale!  I wanted to order the mussels and was told it was the one thing they did not have tonight.  TIP for you mussel lovers - they come in on Thursdays so they are nice and fresh for the busy weekends.  Alex was a great waiter and raved about all items on the menu - kudos to him for going up and down those stairs all night delivering the food and drink.  We had the pleasure of meeting the Red Seal chef/owner Rico himself just before dessert. He is a wonderfully humble guy, French trained and has used his techniques to make his South American food sing. Rico is from Chile and it is obvious that he is proud of this fact and the food he puts out. He works long days getting up early to go and hand pick his veggies and meats for the day. I could absolutely connect with this food on so many levels. I loved the space and the ambiance and we had a wonderful time with our friends.  I want to go back ASAP to try the mussels, crab cakes and chicken and bacon skewers.  A real gem of a restaurant in Airdrie and I could not think of a reason why this restaurant should get any less than 5 stars. We were impressed!"}
{"text":"The over  priced food is merely adequate at best.  The decor  is good but I wouldn't return. I rate this  place a 2 but only because of the decor. Save your money & don't  waste your time there is much better places out there. I also was put off that the owner /Chef didn't stay in the kitchen but felt the need to constantly be apart of our tables conversation. Don't get me wrong I like a congenial host but when you are out for dinner with your sweetie or friends. You don't want a stranger constantly coming to your table and interjecting and interrupting your dinning experience."}
{"text":"Amazing metropolitan restaurant located in the heart of Airdrie. The restaurant is located in an old residential home that was located blocks away from my childhood home. With it's location to the downtown area of Airdrie it's easily accessible by car or foot. It's much different than the usual plain-jane restaurants in Airdrie like Brewsters, Mr. Mikes and Average Joe's and has character.  The tapas that are served have decent portions but are delicious. I especially enjoyed the fiery roasted potatoes. \"Rico\" of Rico's in the Village even came out to our table to see how our food was and had a brief conversation with our party, adding to the character and warm feel of the restaurant. In my opinion Airdrie needs more locally owned and operated restaurants like Rico's."}
