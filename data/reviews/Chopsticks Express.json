{"text":"Sub par mall Chinese food without the hassle of the mall.  I don't really know what I expected but even with the low expectation I was annoyed. It's like a glorified Panda Express. It has a drive thru, and some tables of seating inside, it's pre-made Chinese food in a Panda Express line type of set up and that's really it. I got some lo mein, honestly how can you screw up lo mein?! Welp they did. It was so sticky, my noodles were literally a giant ball of noodle. They have he usual general Tso, teriyaki, orange & sesame chicken, all waiting in their warmers so you don't honestly know how fresh your food is. Price wise it's the same as any other mall Chinese, 2 meats and a side for whatever price.   I was hoping it would be more upscaley (sp?) like a P.F. Chang's but no. This place probably won't make it seeing how a Panda Express is right up the street and they can at least get lo mein correct.   As far as inside, it was super clean and smelled good, which was a great sign, the sidewalk wasn't shoveled so it made for a great game of when will I slip. I give this place 2 stars out of generosity for the nice staff that were friendly and helpful, but it's gonna be a hard no from me."}
{"text":"Way better than panda express, the fried rice is the best I've ever had! The only complaint I have is the setup, I had a hard time figuring out where my food was when it was done and none of the employees knew either, it took a minute to find my order..it was very busy and chaotic and I'm sure they will get the hang of it all someday as they haven't been open for too long.."}
{"text":"Only one option if you're vegetarian or vegan. Mixed veg. That's it. It is not worth it if you don't eat meat. Hard pass."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I thought the food was very good and they give large portions and have excellent prices!!! I have seen other reviews that compare this place to the mall Chinese counters! I ordered the bourbon chicken and it is comparable to the mall but everything tasted really good! And this place is a lot better than a lot of the local Chinese restaurants around! And I wouldn't even compare it too nasty Panda Express!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how satisfied I was with Chopsticks Express. This new restaurant near the Shoppes of Parma has delicious food and large portions at an inexpensive price point. Be prepared to wait in line. The line was long and slow, the employees not extremely efficient. The restaurant offers prepared Chinese food that you can get in portions that include 1, 2 or 3 main entrees in your meal. I ordered chicken teriyaki and noodles which reminded me of the old Parmatown food court favorite, Sakkio Japan. Be prepared that they're cheap with their yum yum sauce. Only one is included with your meal and you have to pay for any extra. I took leftovers home and ate them 3 days later and they were just as delicious. I'll definitely become a regular at Chopsticks Express. It was so delicious!"}
{"text":"Called ahead not realizing the set up. Food was ready upon arrival. Service friendly. place was nice, new and clean. Food was good. Not too salty or seasoned. Better than Panda Express!!!the teriyaki chicken was great. The teriyaki beef was a little bland. Definitely go with chicken next time. Wanted to try lo mein but they filled my order with rice. Rice was ok not good or bad. Will go back kids really enjoyed their lo mein with orange and bourbon chicken."}
