{"text":"Great stop. Clean. Different. Lots of great Amish fresh braked goods.  Nice gift products.  Unique wood products.  Ice cream is too much. Small is a Large in other stores. Produce looks fresh. Watched them make a Sub for another customer. Looked soo gooood!!  Next time. And there will be a next time"}
