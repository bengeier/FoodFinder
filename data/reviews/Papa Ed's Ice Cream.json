{"text":"I have been here once but they are close and today I got opportunity to check them out, they're right at down town Glendale, can be easily missed because its a house but also a ice cream place which is located in the back of the house, Papa Ed's Ice Cream is a nice, cool and fun place to be, there are outdoor seats that is nicely shaded and cool which would be perfect for the summer time. They also take party request like birthdays or group events. The ice cream are very tasty which are from shamrock but the waffle corns are homemade which is the best. I'll be back again and will bring my little cousins and family."}
{"text":"unless you hate ice cream and friendly people you will love Papa Ed's! It's tucked away in Caitlin Court in downtown Glendale.  Walking towards the front you can't help but notice all the love and care that went into the garden and flowers - the flower bed still makes me smile!  Walking through the front door it's easy to forget where and when you are - the wood floors, Vintage coke machine and friendly staff all most made me forget why I was there... ICE CREAM. good selection and great ice cream..   Now let's talk about ice cream pie... Papa Ed's makes to order (with advance notice) ice cream pies. I love the Peanut butter cup with Oreo cookie crust. The lemon and Raspberry sorbet swirl in a  graham cracker crust and my Holiday Favorite - Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream in a graham cracker crust!"}
{"text":"Exceptional ice cream, friendly service, & they just remodeled the patio so it has a fresh new awesome look! Their sundaes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Cute!  Cute!  Cute!  We walked in on Saturday afternoon for dessert, and there was just us and another family.  The gal working the front was sweet and super helpful!  We will definitely be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great little place in Downtown historic glendale. This is our hangout for ice cream especially in their garden. It's very refreshing to see and feel like you are back in time . No drama , no traffic, just friendly customers service and great ice cream."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in downtown Glendale and have a hankering for some Ice Cream, this is the place to go.  It is right in the heart of things, in a wonderfully renovated little square of merchants.  As you walk down the long sidewalk to the entrance, with plenty of arrows and pictures of ice cream cones to guide your way, you will feel as though you are stepping back in time.  Once inside, you will be greeted by the extremely warm and hospitable staff.  The inside is a cute little shop offering about a dozen flavors of ice cream to choose from, as well as a few old-fashioned candies.  There are a few small tables inside, but there are plenty of other seating options and open space in the courtyard that surrounds this and the other neighboring shops.   The prices are extremely reasonable, so even if you are just walking by on your way to another destination, you can easily stop by and get your ice cream fix and be on your way to your destination in no time, without spending more than the spare change in your front pocket."}
{"text":"Not only some of the best ice cream, homemade waffle cones & other treats, but the location, atmosphere (dog friendly patio!!!) & most of all the people are all wonderful. Worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Visited here again tonight and had another great experience. The actual location is great!!  There is a secret garden with plants around and nice little touches all around.  The woman is such a delight! Very nice and helpful.  We had the lemon sorbet & watermelon sorbet and they were both delicious. My son got a tiny little cookie dough cone and that was delicious too.  Was $7 For 2 Scoops and the tiny cone and a water bottle.   We will come back & encourage you to as well."}
{"text":"Adorable little ice cream shop, nestled in the historic district of Glendale. We wanted to take the kids somewhere outside of your average fro yo shop and happened across this little gem on yelp.  We pulled up at 6:13pm and the sign was still outside, however the hours posted said that they closed at 6pm. As we approached, the owner was outside watering the flowers and she waved us in, happy to serve us even though she had closed for the night.  The girls each ordered rainbow sherbet in a cup, I had the strawberries and cream in a sugar cone, and my girlfriend had the butter pecan in a waffle cone. Waffle cones are made in house, and everyone was satisfied with their choice. The total came to $9 and some change (after using the 20% off a regular cone check-in offer, of course).  This is definitely one of those places that I will go out of my way to visit again because the overall experience went above and beyond my expectations. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Excellent ice cream (I got the delicious butternut pecan on a cone) in the unique and super cute Old Town Glendale. Miss Linda is such a nice person, and the ice creamery is just a little jewel! Go get pampered in her cute garden and enjoy her delicious ice cream when you get a chance!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love place. I came all the way from 36th Street and Bell and found out it was close at 530 pm on a Friday. According to Google and Yelp they're open until 7pm."}
{"text":"My boyfriend stopped in here after lunch last week, it was a typical hot AZ summer day and we were both in the mood for something cool. We love downtown Glendale and all the little shops so we decided to stop in for a cool treat. Cute little shop, nice staff, good ice cream, what else can you ask for!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of ice cream and was happy to find a place that served freshly made ice cream sandwiches. Unfortunately, my visit left me very dissatisfied. It began with the service of the two girls working. One took a very long time to make my friend's root beer float and the other just stood there. She rang us up for our order even though I had not actually placed mine yet. Once the girl making the float was done, the other girl asked me what I wanted and There isn't much of a selection on ice cream and though the butter pecan was yummy, the ice cream sandwich needs to be rethought here. I took a bite and the cookies were so hard that they squished the ice cream completely out. I tried to scoop it back on and was very unsuccessful. I went back in to get a spoon and told the girls what happened and their reactions were \"oh.\"  It is a cute place, but the ice cream is regular ice cream and service is terrible."}
{"text":"Great place to get out of the heat when checking out the historic district of Glendale.  Staff is awesome.  And the ice cream, naturally."}
{"text":"The ambiance is super cute! Just wish the ice cream was better. My cone was scooped to perfection"}
{"text":"Stopped in for just a couple of scoops, and I absolutely loved the environment! It's in Historic downtown Glendale, and there's a cool little walk way to the back of this cute little cottage where you'll find the best ice cream in the West Valley! They are local owners, which means they have really unique flavors; on this day I had a vanilla cherry and also a chocolate covered orange I think it was called orange truffle, and it was amazing! Plus they're super friendly, it was an awesome stuff, I truly did not get enough ice cream, but I will next time! If you get a chance to visit downtown Glendale, do not miss these guys especially if you like ice cream!"}
{"text":"This is one of the small business I been wanted to try and today is the day that I finally got the chance to, it's a house that had been converted to a business, the ice cream store is behind the house, it's a neat little place to hang out in a hot Arizona day, would be really awesome and busy in the summer time. I'm really happy with the visit and looking forward to coming back soon. But one thing is I thought since they are a small business they would make their own ice cream but it's shamrock which isn't bad either. And you could also reserve for a party or a big group."}
{"text":"Coming here was an awesome adventure. It was a beautiful day matched by a cute little ice cream shop. I definitely owe this one to yelp for recommending it to me.  Whenever I'm in the mood and I don't know what to eat I always check on yelp for my recommendations. If I hadn't I wouldn't of discovered this awesome little ice cream shop!!  My girlfriend and I decided to go on a week day around 4ish. They have parking right in the front of the area. At first when you get out you may be confused because the building doesn't say ice cream shop! But there is a small sign/walkway that says \"ice cream this way\"  It takes you on a small path behind the building into a garden/backyard where you can find the delicious ice cream shop.   It's very clean inside and organized. They have tons of different flavors to choose from. My favorite part about this ice cream shop is that the police station is near by and you can actually buy a police dog stuffed animal and with the police dogs photo on it! It's pretty epic!   I decided to go with the strawberry ice cream! I added a few sprinkles on top and I have to say it was a pretty damn good ice cream!   I overall rate my experience a 5 star. The only downfall is just the parking. You may have to walk a little bit of ways to reach it but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Sweet little ice cream shop. Whenever you get near downtown Glendale stop by and have a cone. It is good for your soul."}
{"text":"This is our favorite ice cream shop and it's not just about the ice cream but the whole experience! It's tucked behind another business in downtown Glendale, just follow the ice cream cones down the driveway to Papa Ed's! The owner, Miss Linda, is a sweetheart. Ice cream flavors change but some of the staples remain the same. We love the inside and outside seating. She has a little garden that my children just love, they always like to find out what's growing at that time.  If you want to find a place in our big city where you are recognized and greeted like a friend, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Looking up ice cream places near by. I forgot about this one and I love supporting small businesses owners. I've passed by this place when visiting the Chocolate Affair back in February. I'm so glad I got to try it and bringing my 5 year old to try the last batch of Superhero ice cream was a real treat. He downed that ice cream and shared mine. I'll definitely be back and spread the word."}
{"text":"Best hidden secret on the valley!  Nostalgia, sweet treats, fun flavors & a perfect garden to host kids parties.  Extra points cuz they're pet friendly :)"}
{"text":"Really neat place hidden in the back of the 1920's bungalow called The Country Maiden  in the Catlin Court Historic District in downtown Glendale. They have a nice selection of ice cream, and the courtyard is very relaxing.  Here is a couple of tips, They carry Karen's Kreamery ice cream and Frosty Paw frozen treats for your dog! I never knew they were here, glad I found them on yelp!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4.5 Ice cream: 3.0  I want to start off by saying how I really really wanted to like this place. It's set up behind a cute little house and has a creative outside seating area with beautiful flowers and other interesting installments. However, my ice cream experience there was not as great. I went in with a friend on a weekday afternoon to satisfy my sweet tooth craving. I initially sampled the cappuccino flavor, but found it to be a bit tasteless and somewhat freezer burned. I then sampled the monster cookie flavor and settled on that for the day. I grabbed 1 scoop on a sugar cone and was satisfied with the ice cream, but felt like it was pretty average in terms of taste and texture.  When I checked in at Papa Ed's on Yelp, a 20% off coupon popped up. However, the person behind the counter seemed really taken aback by it which made me feel slightly ill at ease. I wanted to use the coupon, but at the same time, I didn't really want the 20% off if it was going to cause too much grief.   Overall, I love the location, but the ice cream itself left much to be desired in terms of flavor. I would be down to going back and trying the cold brew or some of the other treats, but I have to say this is not my go to place for ice cream."}
{"text":"First time here and I love it.A very nice clean place with a friendly staff and enjoying a bowl of yummy watermelon sorbet."}
{"text":"Great small town feel... The ice cream was divine and the service was just as sweet! Definitely a must while in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Who knew that in downtown historic Glendale, there lived the most adorable little locally owned ice cream parlor called Papa Ed's?  I didn't... until today!  I made the thirty minute drive to Glendale from Old Town this afternoon for a meeting and was lucky enough to get a tour of some of the cutest businesses around town.  Papa Ed's was one of them...   My friend Danica walked me inside and introduced me Linda, the owner.  For those that aren't lucky enough to have their private tour guide like I was, Papa Ed's is tucked behind the Country Maiden house turned retail store (which happens to be yet another adorable Glendale business that I will review in due time as well).  Papa Ed's carries both Shamrock Farms and Dreyer's ice cream... it reminds me of a smaller, more local \"Ben and Jerry's\" kind of place.  It's bright, colorful and welcoming...  While I passed on getting an ice cream today, I did take advantage of their outdoor seating; you see, I had a conference call smack dab in the middle of the afternoon.  It was fun to see people go in and out with their ice cream treats.  There's also plenty of beautiful landscaping right outside their door.  Next visit to the area, I'll have to go for an ice cream from Papa Ed's... if you make it there before me, let me know what you think?!"}
{"text":"It was delicious and very welcoming!  we will be back. I had blueberry with Cookie Monster. My son had The pineapple and hubby the cherry Pistachio!"}
{"text":"This location is by far the most relaxing, cutest, & most wonderful place to get some great ice cream! The service was super nice and friendly they have both outside and inside seating but trust me you'll want to sit outside! The only downfall is that they don't have much flavor options. The butter pecan & Cookie Monster flavors were delicious! They also have coffee which I would be interested in trying next time! This place is such a hidden gem and I'll definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"I like being a tourist in my own city from time to time. I think walking around the local downtown Glendale shops gives me that vavcation feel, especially on a comfotably warm day in February.   Papa Ed's had been on my bookmarked list of things to try for a while and this day just seemed so perfect to finally go for a visit.  The location is just so cute. They have a small garden in the front yard of the house and the whole atmosphere is just very charming.  The ice cream itself was very tastey. I think they only sell Shamrock Farms ice cream, which is although not made in house but is at least supporting another local business."}
{"text":"Very nice little hidden ice cream parlor behind one of the Catlin Court shops.  Very much enjoyed sitting in their garden having the softest, smoothest ice cream.  Not sure if it's homemade but it sure tasted like it.  Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"This is the cutest ice cream shop ever! I love going in here and trying their new creations. My husband and daughter also love the choices. I think it is amazing that they are so creative. Their newest edition-the fairy house out front is adorable and I think my daughter could have looked at it for hours! Great scenery and amazing treats!"}
{"text":"Like another reveiwer said, i was hoping for some homemade icecream. They offer a couple of brand ice creams and thats it. Nothing special. It is a really neat location in downtown Glendale and the lady is really nice. I think they should atleast offer a few homemade ice cream options and see how it goes and weed out the brand stuff :-("}
{"text":"Such a great place to get good ice cream. I love the little baby cones they have my nephews love it."}
{"text":"On a visit to Glendale this week I remembered a friend tell me about this cute ice cream shop they thought my kids might like. Right when we pulled up I knew they would. Visible from the street was a cute sign with ice-cream cones painted on the sidewalk to light your way.  Walk a little further and run into A flower garden made out of an old bed and tub. When we went they were out of a lot of flavors due to a late delivery, but we were still able to get something we enjoyed. It was a bit more expensive than I would normally pay for a scoop of ice cream, but for treating the kids to a new adventure it was worth it."}
{"text":"I think this location is way cool and the atmosphere is from the 50's but the ice cream was just Dryers and Shamrock.  I was wishing it was homemade since it would fit the ambiance.  This is a small house behind another that have both been converted to businesses in downtown Glendale.  We went out of our way to support this business since we were at the Chocolate Affair and did not want to just give the money to a temporary vendor in the area."}
{"text":"I took my grandparents here and they absolutely loved it.  Papa Ed's is a relaxing, little hidden gem in Glendale's historic district.  The business is nestled inside an attractively decorated guest house or shop in the backyard of what I assume to be the home of the owners.  The proprietors are very nice and accommodating even minutes before they are scheduled to close.  The little gardens reminded us of home in the Pacific Northwest and their shady trees helped provide us with a much needed respite from the sun.  I would love it if they made some really good milkshakes, but it didn't look like they offered any.  They were also out of some flavors, but that's okay.  The ice cream was delicious, which made the experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"They didn't have any chai tea ! Which is my go to drink. Therefore I didn't get anything. The coffee is a kind of make it yourself. She hands you a cup of ice. That was weird to me. The place is really cute and offers discounts on ice cream for checking in ."}
{"text":"This place is adorable!! From the quaint decor, painted ice cream path and friendly staff to the delicious ice cream... This ace is totally worth going to!!  I love love love the cappuccino splatter ice cream and the pumpkin!!  Also with the check in deal- what more could we ask for?"}
{"text":"Nice ice cream shop! Small cozy place in downtown Glendale. I live close by, so this is my place to get a good treat. Staff is friendly. Some neat retail items too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have had a baby shower here before I had my son. Linda the owner is so awesome and caring. When planning the shower Linda was very helpful and organized. She went over everything with me from top to bottom. She really wants to make sure you have a special day. When we got there the morning of the shower Linda had everything ready the table for the food, she had the coffee and tea ready, the ice cream and waffle bowls, and all the decor was all ready. We had some personal touches and Linda was extremely flexible and kinda to let us use them. The girls that help the guests with ice cream where very nice. Overall my shower was very meaningful and special.   For my son's first birthday (which we promised Linda we would come) we where still very welcomed as always. We got my son a small ice cream cone for his birthday and my husband and I got a ice cream to share. We loved sitting out on the porch and enjoying the garden and my son got to run around the nice grass area.   We soon after had my now sister in laws bridal  shower here. I had called Linda a made a reservations for a open Sunday for my sister in laws shower. Linda was more then helpful. She made everything perfect to a T. We had a every lovely time and everyone loved the ice cream!   I can honestly say that this is a perfect location for all the different parties from birthdays to showers. Linda and the girls are fantastic and very helpful. I love this little ice cream shop. The people really make you feel like family. I will definitely be having my son's birthday here when he gets a little older."}
{"text":"What a sweet little ice cream shop! Located in a historic part of Glendale, the atmosphere was quaint and quiet.  There are a couple of national brands of ice cream served along with a local brand. The locally made ice cream won out hands down! If in doubt, ask for a sample before purchasing, they are happy to accommodate.  There is also a nice sitting area outside. Yummy. Go get some!"}
{"text":"Quaint and lovely place to enjoy some ice cream. The ice cream connisusier let us sample some flavors before we committed, which was fantastic and helped up decide on a flavor. Loved it."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem of a place here on Yelp. Papa Ed's Ice cream shop is a tiny family owned local shop in downtown Glendale near the location where Glendale glitters and a hand full of other events are hosted. It's tucked away behind a shop that transfers DVRs but it's easy to find with all the cute small signs and pathway.   With a check in we got a 20% off our ice creams and we enjoyed our ice cream on the patio. Enjoyed the ice cream and the experience!   We'll be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Super cute ice cream shop in downtown Glendale! The owner was friendly. The ice cream was delicious. We will definitely be back if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome ice cream and people. I have really loved the treats here and also the people. You cannot go wrong with any flavor you choose. There are specialty ice creams made for the shop. Come by and and have a great treat."}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for local, ma & pop shops, etc. But I won't be back to this one. It was quaint/cute, & the staff was friendly. But you offer 16 favors, 13 of which are Dreyer's (yuck)! The other 3 were from a ice cream shop in some other city. Now, $4.50 for 2 scoops, ya really can't complain about (if it was ice cream that was MADE THERE, on site). But noooo, I could of picked up a 1/2 gallon of Dreyer's (junk) if I wanted to go that route. So, there you have it."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place but could never find it. It's tucked behind another shop and is very easily missed from the street.  I love the Old Town Glendale area and Papa Ed's Ice Cream fits in perfectly in the neighborhood. Everything about Papa Ed's is charming and you can tell that a lot of love and care has been put into this ice cream shop. I think it being tucked away behind another shop added to the charm. It was nice to sit outside eating ice cream with two friends away from the hustle and bustle just a few feet away. From the sidewalk until you step into Pap Ed's, the charm  really creates a lot of build up, I felt a bit let down when I saw the variety of ice cream offered. While the ice cream was tasty, it was kinda of a disappointment that it was the same brand and mostly the same flavors that I can purchase in any grocery store. I was hoping for some homemade ice cream or at least some unique  flavors or something to mix in like fruit or candy.  So close Papa Ed's! So close!! Still a positive rating though!"}
{"text":"Went in for an ice cream this afternoon and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. The young lady working the counter was very friendly and helpful and their ice cream and waffle cones were excellent. This is a good spot to get some ice cream on a warm day."}
{"text":"I was walking back to my car and passed this place.  Ice cream is my favorite food.  Did you think I wasn't going to stop? ;-)  I walked inside and was greeted by a super happy, cheerful young lady.  I browsed their selections for a minute and decided on a double scoop in a sugar cone.  I forget the exact name of the ice cream I got, but I know it was made by Karens Kreamery down in Avondale.  It was a cookies and cream type ice cream with something else mixed in.  $4.50 and I was out the door.  The ice cream was pretty good!  Nice and rich and incredibly smooth.  Tons of cookie pieces throughout.  The only reason for 4 stars was the lack of variety.  As others have said, most of their flavors were regular Dryers brand and they only had 3-4 selections of \"good stuff\".  The building is cool, and the service was excellent.  I would come back if I was in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Cutest ice cream place ever!!!! I lovveeeddd it and there Chicago pop fly ice cream is the bessstt"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE coming here!! It's like stepping back into time and for a minute you kind of forget that your in the city. I had a small birthday party for my daughter here and the owner Linda was so sweet and helpful. The prices are great, the ice cream is yummy, and the garden is great for photos. I plan on celebrating many more birthdays here .!"}
{"text":"The ice cream is delicious, the owner is the nicest person ever, and it's a local business I love to support. What else is there to say?? Go to Papa Ed's to cool down and enjoy yummy ice cream and delightful service!"}
{"text":"This is a great little shop for ice cream! Located right in the middle of downtown Glendale.. the owners are very friendly and helpful when we asked for local restaurants to eat at. I'll definitely be back."}
