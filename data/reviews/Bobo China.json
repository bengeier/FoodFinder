{"text":"This place has the worst chinese food I've ever eaten. I have been to quite a few chinese restaurants and have chinese friends who often let me sample their food. This food does not even begin to compare. The flavors were all over the place. Its a nice place with nice service but when it comes down to it I think the food plays a big part in the review of a restuarant."}
{"text":"Great service, quality Chinese.  They even served me soup while I wait for my take out :)"}
{"text":"The food was incredibly good and extremly well priced. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Bobo China was just what I needed to fulfill my chinese take-out craving.  It is tucked away in the Smart and Final parking lot at Sahara and Durango.  I usually call ahead and pick up.  I wouldn't recommend dining in as there are only a few tables and the ambiance is nothing to write home about.  The food, however, is everything I wanted.  I ordered the pork lo mein and the mongolian beef.  The lo mein was tasty and had a decent amount of pork in it.  The mongolian beef was good but had a lot of onions.  Definitely don't order if you don't care for them.  The portions were generous so I'll definitely be having left overs.  The girl at the front is great, always making sure everything is just right.  This place is a hidden gem perfect when you're craving some Chinese take-out....4 stars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas. The owners are always nice and friendly. They treat me like family. The food is fantastic. The service is impeccable and the prices are more than fair and lower than some fast food restaurant. I won't go to any other Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Thank you BoBo."}
{"text":"Quality take out for sure! I had the orange chicken and the pieces of chicken were tasty and seasoned great. This is my new spot for reasonably priced, delicious dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I was a first time customer, went on the recommendation of friends.  Ordered the General Zao's Chicken as a lunch special.  First, it was a lot of food for one person. The soup was a yummy egg drop soup, exactly as you would expect. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the level of spice was lighter than I expected. But not to worry, the owner's wife (who was also my server) brought me some fresh made dried chilies in oil. The fried rice was not oily (which can easily happen). She also gave me a side lo mein, it was perfectly cooked and slightly sweet. The sweet was something I didn't expect but fit the dish well. I figure if a restaurant can do a good job making a twice fried entree and it comes out crispy and the chicken is not over cooked, they can make anything.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was searching for something affordable and good with good portion sizes..tried it on the 24 Dec..
The lady there was personable and friendly. 
The food great..I love the portion sizes enough for me and my family to eat the next day..depending on how hungry we are...for the amount of money he'll yeah .it's my new Chinese food to go place now
I thought I had found it with Chow Mien  house..but they are not consistent with thier portion sizes and a little pricey for mwahh..."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Delicious - the kung pao and Mongolian beef are amazing! And what tops it off is the best service you will ever have at any restaurant. I will be going there again and again!"}
{"text":"Great Food and the staff is outstanding. Good size portions and very reasonable prices. They will make things extra spicy if you want, and give you soup why you wait for your to go order.  Customer service is a lost art these days, but these guys nail it.  I always have a great experience here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Gteat food great food at reasonable prices very friendly staff very generous sized portions"}
{"text":"I have been ordering food here for years, love how accommodating, friendly, genuine they are. Not to mention the delicious food!!!! I personally recommend their soup, noodles, rice, and veggies (so pretty much everything) I also love how they remember who you are. To them you are more then an order number, you are their friend. I will continue to come back hungry for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"Small little place but the food and the price was really good. I went there with my husband and my toddler and we had a really nice and delicious dinner. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have ever had!!!!! I get orange chicken and fried rice every time!!! It's unreal. My boyfriend and I order takeout like once a week! It kills me that they're closed on Sundays!! The owner is so kind, she remembered me and my order after two times of calling in- she's wonderful. I LOVE Bobo!!!!"}
{"text":"Great price, great food ::orange chicken:: I will never step foot in a panda express ever again, Bobo's is just better & my Mom loves it too! Shelly is super nice!"}
{"text":"I love this mom and pop spot. At frist i was alittle put off by the waitress until i realized its her sense of humour is sarcastic...so we got along great. The food was great and the price is right. I would have given 5 stars but my egg roll was cold in the middle but rice and entrees were on point"}
{"text":"This place is the best. The staff is awesome really funny and friendly. The food is delicious. I totally recommend the general tso's chicken. The prices are fair and reasonable!"}
{"text":"My Pho was really poor compared to other places,on spring Mountain, the portion was small and I had to ask for changing the beef - it was chewy and dud not looked good. Luckily they changed the meat but still no taste and small portion for the price."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome!!!!!!!!!!! And the lady there is amazing !!!!!! A+++++ definitely recommend this place. Also I was looking at the comments and the person that said that got food poisoning from the rice is an idiot :D!"}
{"text":"Aunty Bobo! This is our go to place when we're feeling lazy. I absolutely love the egg drop soup. It's the simplest thing, but sometimes simple is perfect. I'd recommend the beef chow fun and chicken with garlic sauce.

I wouldn't recommend this place to someone who is very traditionally Chinese (e.g. my mother), but for Hapa kids like us, it's all good."}
{"text":"I love this place!   I'm there at least once a week.  Great variety of rice and noodle dishes.  Every dish is served hot and made to your specifications - and if you go back Shelly WILL remember exactly how you like it.  Reasonable prices; family run.  Lots of repeat customers originally from the East Coast (New York/New Jersey) and Midwest (Chicago)  where we (speaking as a Midwesterner) have many choices and KNOW good Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 3 years, the food never gets old. Shelly is so cool and kind. Definitely recommend the crab ragoons, they are the best I've found in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love to go here, reasonably priced, quick and eatable. Not to mention the server/hostess is really awesome. Its small and they really make you feel like your at home. love it :)

beef lo mein is really good, give it a try."}
{"text":"Shelly and her husband know good food for a great price .. plus know you after just meeting you! I always feel special when I go in. 
You can't beat the lunch price and menu. I take everyone I know! And have for the 3 years I've lived in Vegas. 
You can't beat the place. It's fast. Good and they really try to keep you happy. 
My favorite spot when I need a little TLC."}
{"text":"never eat here! i was at seattle dan's pizza a few doors down, the owner told me the water system was shut off for a few hours in the whole complex and by regulations business has to close, with the water shut down, cant wash hands, cant wash dishes, cant flush toilets, they stayed open without water turned on, health dept had every right to come in and fine them! they will serve you dirty and it is not healthy!"}
{"text":"Great food, hilarious and helpful host who I assumed is the owner. Ordered chicken and broccoli which is great for people watching their figure!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients you can taste, authentic taste, absolutely delicious and inexpensive - not cheap."}
{"text":"Im born and raised in las vegas and bobo china is the best Chinese food in town. The lady that runs the register is there 6 days a week and shes so awesome.. The place is very very small so i get my order to go, always done fast and everything is so fresh."}
{"text":"Love the egg drop soup and the mongolian beef extra spicey!! This is my top take out choice 4 chinese food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Personalized service (she knows my name and order when I call) and genuinely nice people and dine-in quality food."}
{"text":"I ordered the lemon chicken, hunan beef and lo mein.
The lemon chicken is to die for. So good and the crispy coating made it all the way home. Hunan beef could be spicier. Take out order was fast, service super nice and I will go often. A great neighborhood joint!! Priced right too!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here because I was craving salt and pepper fish, and it did not disappoint! Both my husband and I were skeptical but damn, it was so good! Highly recommend! Prices are cheap and the lady who served me was so damn sweet, I even gave her a hug because she made my day! I love her customer service! Go here if you're craving great Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Hardly any neighborhood Chinese restaurants get Peking pork right. Bobo China nails it.  Service is always great and friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I loved the sweet and sour pork combo meal. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I get the mapo tofu dish all the time. It is delicious. The owner is super cool and kind too. I definitely recommend this place for some Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Such a great find! Everything we've ordered is so fresh. Best egg fu yung and shrimp fried rice!"}
{"text":"Small Place of Deliciousness. I searched yelp went by reviews and am Not Disappointed. Food is Great and Service was Nicer!! Very Generous plate for amount charged..We don't live here but visit often enough to make it a Return for Yummy spot. If someone was unhappy I would venture to say it was Not because of the establishment. Personally we are Delighted. Ample parking in strip mall by Smiths and other shops. I should have snapped a Pic but my tummy took over the thought"}
{"text":"Tasty food, very flavorful. Good prices, spunky service. Had the string bean beef and was impressed with the tender beef and firm beans. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I love BoBo!! Our family has been coming here for years.  You can't beat the prices for the amazing food!  Whenever we have family in town, this is where we get take out from.  There is not much room to have a sit down dinner, but the take out is so worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the best chinese ever! Was looking forward to going today (Sunday) but sadly they are closed. So I had to go to the second best chinese spot here in Vegas. Can't wait to get my favorite again. Their beef and broccoli is amazing!"}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying the lady in front was a little rude to me on the phone. Not only did she try to tell me what not to order, she told me what to order. I guess you can't order what you want here. Then my wife goes in to pick up our food and the lady tells her \"your husband is lazy, I can't believe he sends you inside to get his food\".  That Pissed my wife off right away.
 We ordered our usual order that we normally get at any Chinese takeout. Pork fried rice (it comes with the burnt taste for free) not good. Chow mein that come with extra mushy noodles and kung pao chicken that's  nice and extra oily. Not good at all."}
{"text":"Mongolian Beef & Shrimp -n- Lobster sauce with steam white rice. REALLY good Chinese F word, we will return for the to-go order because theres only 4 tables. JKKUHL LLC"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!! This place is so so so good. I've sent a lot of people in over the last 4 years. Never one complaint. My girlfriend LOVES them!!! Sweet n sour pork or chicken is awesome. I love the BBQ pork tried rice. Or any fried rice, really. SPRING ROLLS, general Tso's chicken, and of course, the egg drop soup is to die for. I have eaten there sooo many times I can't count. Please do yourself a favor and go!! If you're from New York, the owner will love you. She is sooooo funny. Her laugh is infectious! She remembers me and my order the whole 4 years. She treated my mom so well and made her feel happy and welcome before she passed away. She ate there all the time  :)"}
{"text":"I'm sad to have to write a negative review, we had high hopes for this place based on the other reviews.
We are new to this side of town, and tonight we were at our new house painting - none of our dishes are here yet so we figured why not get Chinese? So we ordered from Bobo - Mongolian beef with fried rice, 2 egg rolls and a wonton soup. 
It came in about 40 minutes (a little slow, but the delivery guy was nice). When I opened the package up I was disappointed to find no spoon - I have no dishes so I can't eat my wonton soup. However, after looking at it, I didnt want to eat it anyway...it was super oily and had some kind of gross bright purple mystery meat in it (pork? Chicken? Something more sinister? Honestly I couldn't tell). My boyfriends Mongolian beef was okay, although not at all spicy like I had ordered. Fried rice was greasy and bland at best. 
Sorry Bobo, you won't be our new Chinese takeout place :-("}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Vegas. Owner is always so nice and helpful. She really cares about the food and the quality. 

This place will continue to be a weekly stop. 

The egg drop soup is excellent and you get it with all meals, even when you are waiting on your take out. 

So far, we have eaten the pad thai, general tsao, 2 different shrimp dishes, sweet and sour pork, and the Mongolian beef. All excellent. 

The crab Rangoon for starters is a must get."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food in Las Vegas. Very small inside, so would recommend as take out."}
{"text":"Finally found my place!

We decided to check out the nearby Chinese food places. This one had great reviews and we see why! We went about 30 minutes before closing and ordered the daily special. My bf got orange chicken unspicy and I got shrimp and broccoli. She explained it would take about 7-10 minutes to make. And she allowed us to eat the soup although we were ordering to go. The customer service was excellent. And the food was hot and delicious. When we got home the egg rolls were still steaming hot! We were full and happy. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Thanks to you yelpers,  the food is excellent and decently priced! The place is not really a sit down deal (small dining area),  but definitely made for takeout. My son, who's a really picky eater, loved the egg drop soup! Will be coming back for more..."}
{"text":"Agree with the other reviewers. Tasty Chinese food that is super cheap. Portions are generous too. Friendly service and they obviously have many regulars which is a good sign. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"CLOSED!?!?   Drove some distance on 14th after seeing a 6/8 review and windows taped up. Hopefully just a move....please advise."}
{"text":"I love Bobo China!  I forward to coming here as often as possible for lunch.  The $4.95 special is a great deal for a sit down meal. The food and service is always excellent.    I've tried just about everything on the menu and there's nothing I would avoid.  The orange chicken is amazing!  Server is always extra friendly with my young daughter."}
{"text":"The food was good and everything tasted fresh. I ordered the Mongolian Pork on the all day special menu and you get a good amount of food for the price. The location is rather small with just a few tables so take-out is best. The cashier has a unique personality that can come off as rude but I feel it ads charm to the process. I just stared working down the street from this location so I will definitely frequent Bobo China."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and already I'm in love! The owner has a great sense of humor and awesome customer service! She gave us a few recommendations for our take out order since we were so indecisive and ended enjoying our meal! She even gave us complimentary egg flower soup while we waited! (Which was soo yummy) 
I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST chinese food ever. This is my first time here and I was amazed. They cook the food when you order and its affordable."}
{"text":"We have come here twice so far and both times have been amazing, the food is super delicious and part of what really makes this place stand out is the lady who waitresses, she has a good humorous attitude and makes you feel very welcome. We love this little gem and will come as often as we can. Thank you all who work here for always putting out the freshest, tastiest chinese food!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! The food is soo good here. Probably one of the best chinese i've had for a while. Also, the lady who took my order was super nice."}
{"text":"Had my first meal here today...definitely won't be my last. The food was fresh and plenty of it. Prices were reasonable and the owner was caring and friendly. An amazing gem in the city of fabulous restaurants."}
{"text":"Ordered the kung pao, general tso chicken, and Mongolian beef. Really impressed with both Mongolian beef and general tso chicken. They say the general tso chicken is spicy, but if ordered right off menu the way it is, I think anyone could eat it because it wasn't spicy to me. They can also make it spicier if you prefer. The Mongolian beef was well seasoned and if you are used to this dish being spicy and like it that way, ask to order it with some spice because just off the menu there is no spice at all, but it is still excellent. The kung pao was okay, more impressed with other two dishes."}
{"text":"absolutely not consumable, so salty so msg we left 90% of what we ordered... very upset, very disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch. I was hungry cause I did not eat breakfast. 

As we entered, it is a small restaurant with about 8 tables. There was dark tint on their windows. The nice waitress welcomed us inside. 
They have lunch specials from 11 am to 3 pm which include an egg drop soup with a main entree, Lo mein, and your choice of rice. Not bad. We all had cold waters to drink. 

I ordered the Mongolian beef with fried rice and came with noodles. The noodles were really good. Soft and flavored with soy sauce. I was a little disappointed in the Mongolian beef. It was good but they gave me more onions than meat. A little stingy on the meat. The fried rice was good. The best Chinese food I have tasted so far here. 

Service was great by our waitress. She was telling us it is a family owned business. She was talking to my daughter and made her feel better. Waitress  gave my daughter an egg drop soup on the house because she wasn't feeling good. She even massaged my daughter's head. Wow! Super nice! 
I definitely will return here if we are in the neighborhood. Good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food we have had in a very long time. We love the owner!   Egg Foo Young absolutely the best!! Just like in Chicago!! Love the egg rolls & potstickers.  Small place, but the food is awesome! !"}
{"text":"One of Las Vegas' best kept secrets! An incredible value, and the food is SO much better than you might expect. Every dish I've tried is delicious, with orange chicken being my favorite. Lo mein is another irresistible dish. Friendly server Shelly (who remembers your last order, from your last visit, down to the special requests), and an intimate dining room, of just four tables, that feels like home (just with much better food). A must-visit restaurant. You'll absolutely love it. I'll be building a Web site for them soon, and trust me, I'm taking my payment in amazing food!"}
{"text":"Love there Singapore noodles with shrimp! Sooo good! It's been over 2 years since I've been here since I've been out if state. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time.  Small restaurant but the value and taste for lunch is unbeatable.  Kung Pao lunch options were outstanding and they were willing to make the dish more or less spicy according to one's tastes.  A delicious egg drop soup is the starter for all lunch combos ($4.99 and above) and the main entree you order (Kung Pao Chicken in my case) comes with noodles (lo mein/chow mein style) and steamed or fried rice-your choice.  The flavors and ingredients are top notch here-portion sizes are very adequate!  Our server (potentially the owner?) was friendly, efficient, and had a great sense of humor to top it off!  I really enjoyed her personality!  She was very nice and brought out extra items to satisfy my craving for spicy food-white pepper, Sriracha, and there was also hot chili oil on the table.  

My gf loved it here too.  And the people sitting at the table in front of ours were also exclaiming how good the food was!  If you like Chinese food, I really don't think you can go wrong with Bobo China!"}
{"text":"Great food! Such nice caring and quick service. I hope to eat here at least 1-2x a week, soooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"We eat here several times a month... The food is good and affordable. Shelly, that answers the phones and serves customers, is amazing. She always remembers you and seems to uncannily remember your order from last time. Very personable. Makes you feel welcomed. Not a lot of tables, small eating area. We usually order for pick up."}
{"text":"I've never left here without a smile :)

The owner Shelly makes everyone feel important & it's because you are. She's the type of character you'll never forget. She's friendly & warm & remembers everyone & everything you've done in her restaurant or said. We adore her! 

The food is great and it's one of the best values around for lunch or dinner. You'll never leave hungry. It's the type of place where you find yourself ordering your favorite dish each time you come back. We also love the egg drop soup which she always adds her magic ingredients to at the table which take it to the next level (chili oil & white pepper). 

This place is tiny with only a few tables but somehow we've never had to wait and we love grabbing takeout on extra busy days and the food is just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. Your dishes will come with all sorts of extras like egg rolls, cream cheese rangoons & fried shrimp. I love dipping them in the sweet & sour sauce or hot mustard! Everything we've tried here has been really great!

I also want to point out that Shelly pays attention to your habits & if you don't eat something she'll say I can make you that without the water chestnuts. She'll customize dishes to your liking & you'll stop wasting food :) 

I also left my favorite pair of sunglasses here months ago & Shelly held on to them for me. This is one of our regular spots for the food & of course the owner!

*Closed on Sundays"}
{"text":"excellent food and service.  Shelly is in charge and is a gracious hostess."}
{"text":"Bobo China is our new go-to Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas.  We discovered it on Yelp - it had so many positive reviews that we had to try it out.  

The high ratings were completely legit!  For a mere $27, we enjoyed a batch of crispy, flavorful potstickers with a selection of dipping sauces, honey walnut shrimp, general Tso's chicken, beef chow fun, and steamed rice. Everything was fresh and delicious. All white meat chicken, sauces to perfection.  We stuffed ourselves last night and still have leftovers today.

I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. It may be a bit of a drive from Summerlin but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"One of those days when takeout Chinese and the TV are all you can handle?
Come here and place your order, while you wait you get a complimentary bowl of egg drop soup, then it's back home to your sweatpants and Netflix. You know what I'm talking about.

Best option is the lemon chicken- it's like the chinese food version of junk food, but the version here has two gigantic servings of chicken and is practically swimming in a generous amount of the perfectly sweet lemon sauce. Mad cheap with a side of rice for like $8.

If you're going the healthy route, the shrimp and vegetable stir fry with brown rice is also a good option- lots of snap peas, broccoli, carrots, and celery in a flavorful sauce with several shrimp. Combo also comes with an eggroll, rangoon, and a fried shrimp, also for $8.

Order both and add in a Big-Gulp-sized Thai tea and a tip for a date night around $20.
Service is friendly and relatively quick, can't beat the price for the quality."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is cheap and good, the two criteria for being a Yelp favorite. Throw in friendly and efficient service and you got yourself a winner.  Stopped in for a quick lunch of Moo Goo Gai Pan, which was fresh and delicious.  Drank about six glasses of water too.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"YES! YES! YES!, someone finally got the flavor and the texture right when it comes to making Vegetarian tofu and vegetable fried rice. My husband and I visited Bobo's New Years Eve. Not wanting to fight the Las Vegas crowds we elected to pick up dinner and bring in the new year with sparkling cider, noise makers and a big sloppy kiss @ midnight. Though we had never heard of Bobo's. And it didn't really sound Chinese to us. We decided we had little to lose. So we trusted our faithful GPS system and headed to the closest Chinese restaurant to our location. Let me tell you we were not disappointed. The customer service was wonderful. And both my vegetarian meal and my husbands Lo Mein w/ chicken & vegetables and his chicken wings were on point. Very seldom have I found a place that is able to satisfy my Chinese itch. It was so good the first time, I had to go back a few days later to find out if my taste buds were dreaming. AND GUESS WHAT? They weren't. Even the second visit was beyond satisfying. And when I heated up my left overs for lunch the following day. The vegetables, rice and tofu were not mushy or oily the way some dishes get from reheating them. I recommend not only this restaurant for the quality time and energy they put into their food. But also for the care and concern for their guests. I would have given them 5 stars however I was unable to have a spring roll because they fry them in same oil as meat products. :(  so I was left wanting. But do let that deter you from and excellent meal.

I really had a great foodie experience. I was glad I capped the end of the year off with Bobo's. I have already recommended the restaurant to family. And IM recommending it to you.

Love Jordan"}
{"text":"After some research for Chinese, my husband found this restaurant and called in a pick-up order. As he was making our order, he asked about the ingredients in the wonton soup. Unfortunately, he was unable to order it due to his allergy to an ingredient in the dish, but when he went to pick up our order, the female owner who had taken his call asked why he had decided against the soup. He explained his allergy and she offered to make the soup special for him when he calls in again.

While we were both very pleased with the food, I'm even more impressed with the owners. The offer to make something special shows me that the owners truly care about their patrons and their satisfaction with the food. This action goes above and beyond. We are grateful, well fed, and impressed. We will definitely be returning, very happily."}
{"text":"Yes, it is cheap... and small... and dingy... the food is average, usually drowning in whatever sauce is part of the dish. They do use excellent breast meat in the orange chicken and the pot stickers are excellent. I am not crazy about anything else I have had here. Average at best. The woman who runs the place is sour and dour, unsmiling, abrupt, curt and rude most of the time. I want to always give my money to hard working family business, but not here..."}
{"text":"Was awesome, the lady that helped us was really nice and ever gave us some soup while we waited, which was really good. We ordered the pork fried rice which was really good, and the chicken lo main which was also really good. Overall this place was amazing and I would recommend"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood chinese. Affordable, delicious, and great customer service. Volcano Shrimp will change your life!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! Had been looking for a good Chinese restaurant with lunch specials and take-out. This one is above and beyond my expectations. The food is great and the staff is helpful and attentive. Dining room is small, but very cozy and clean. The lunch specials are a real deal!! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for tasty, consistent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Wanted to like Bobo..I loved kidding around with the hostess..She's got a FABULOUS personality..

The food? Semi tasty at first but once you realize how low the quality of the meat is..man! I stopped eating..my wife took one look and wouldn't even try it"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had, the chicken was under sauced. The won ton soup was mostly pees and vegetables and flavorless, tasted like it was from a can. The fried rice was dry.. pretty much everything was bad, very unfortunate"}
{"text":"Come here often and the food is amazing and the service is even better. This place deserves more recognition for sure."}
{"text":"It's a tradition in our family to order pizza or Chinese the night before Christmas.  After reading all the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try Chinese from BoBo China.

Boy, am I glad that we did!

I placed the order on the phone with a super nice lady that I could tell was a very happy soul. :)

We ordered:
*Chicken Fried Rice
*Chicken Lo Mein
*Crab Rangoons

They said they would be about 30 minutes, but the food was here in about 15 minutes- what a pleasant surprise!

Everything was FULL of flavor!  Probably my favorite fried rice from a takeout place EVER!  My mom ordered the Chicken Lo Mein and ate the entire thing (to her surprise!) cause it was that good!

I was happy to see that the Crab Rangoons came with spicy mustard, which is one of my favorites and it was super good!

This is now my 100% go-to for Chinese delivery!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious food! My husband found this place online and insisted we give it a try. I'm so glad he insisted. Let me tell you .... if you want delicious Chinese food, this is the spot! I love mom and pop places. They always have great food. This place is small and cozy. They greet you immediately as you walk in... something that is rare now a days. So I ordered the shrimp fried rice which is full of plump juicy shrimps unlike most small Chinese food restaurants. This dish was delicious. They have a house chicken lunch combo. It's deep fried chicken with teriyaki sauce. It comes with noodles and fried rice.... omg.... just so flavorful. An explosions of wonderful flavors just roaming around your mouth! I also had the egg drop soup, I can not have Chinese food without egg drop soup. This soup was delicious as well. If you're looking for great Chinese food, affordable ( and I mean affordable!!) and delicious ... this is THE spot!"}
{"text":"We probably eat here at least twice a month...and I've converted many neighbors. We even stayed loyal to Bobo after moving a few miles further away. Why? An unbeatable combination of low price and ALWAYS made-fresh food. Unlike a lot of cheap Chinese places where the food is made ahead and soggy, Bobo always makes it fresh and to order. How do I know? Because it's become a tradition that we always bring a red bell pepper in, so my friend can have it in her pepper steak, instead of green bell pepper. One of the reviewers called the proprietress \"Madam Mao\", and Shelly can be ascerbic; but you grow to love her :-) I've encountered this particular brand of Chinese humor before, and actually feel honored that she treats us like friends in that way. She always knows what you like (BAM, the chili oil goes on the table as soon as we walk in; or is always in the bag with our takeout!). They don't need my review to get more business, b/c they're busy as He##, but they do deserve my praise!"}
{"text":"If you just want a small, family owned Chinese cooking, this is the place. Don't come here expecting anything super fancy, it's just down right good Chinese food. My family is from west Canada, where there is plenty of great Chinese restaurants both in food and service. We haven't found a place that compares to any of those restaurants until we came to Bobo's. You'll always see the wife up front and she will remember you and your order. You're greeted with a smile and sassy attitude. I absolutely love her. Her husband is behind the kitchen deliciousness. 
If you come in and order to go, or stay and eat, you will always be welcomed with a small bowl of egg drop soup... come on who doesn't want some delicious egg drop soup?! If you need a recommendation just ask and she will guide you- just have to pick you're \"protein\" (chicken, pork, beef). 
The dumplings are a must. I love the volcanic shrimp- it's a different kind of crispy. It's not tempura but it's not a heavy deep fry. Well I think it's deep fried, it is, but it's not a regular kind of deep fry. Today my mom and I went in and we had this garlicy sauce dish- oh my goodness, perfection. Not overly garlic, no chunks of it, just a good garlic sauce. 
I really just recommend this place if you need a full belly of Chinese food. Always hits my Chinese craving right. 
PS- Closed on Sundays. (Much love and respect for this family place.)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat here about every other week, always great service, delicious food, and great prices. The waitress remembers or faces and is always quick to take care of us. Will recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Love this place! The lady that is at the front is a riot! Food is priced well, everything is cooked to order so wait that wait! Chow/lo mein with the lunch combo was a bit soggy, but the main dish (kung pao shrimp/honey walnut shrimp) was hot and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Bought the Orange Chicken Lunch Special for to-go. It was so good, even when it had cool down. Plus the service was so nice & quick. Totally recommend it! Definitely would come back soon :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  The best fried chicken wings in town.  Their egg rolls and Egg Flower Soup is equally as good.  Everything I have ordered is fresh and hot.  I eaten here several times and plan to return many more times"}
{"text":"Boba is the greatest Chinese spot off of Spring Mountain. Great prices and amazing food. After my first order the lovely lady who works there remembers my special instructions and the extra sauces. Love it!"}
{"text":"Looooove this place!!! This is the only Chinese restaurant that I go to. My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves Shelly and her delicious food. Always fresh and hot, plus such great prices. She always knows what we want no need to even order."}
{"text":"Finally there is a Chinese takeout place close to where I live that is actually good!  It's a very small restaurant and they seemed swamped but handled it well.  The server/phone operator/take out staff (all one person) gave me a bowl of egg drop soup while I waited for my take out, which was nice.  All while handling two dine-in tables, phone orders, and other people waiting for take-out.  

The food came out in 15 minutes like she promised, was very tasty, and for $20 there was a ton of it!  We tried the Hunan beef, the Kung Pao pork and the wonton soup.  All were excellent.  Yay! Thanks Yelp for another great suggestion!"}
{"text":"Great food... amazingly low price for the amount and value of the food served. 
Small and obviously local hangout... a \"hole in the wall\" find for great Chinese food!
I gave 4 stars because there just was not enough room in this place... lucky you if you can get a table for 4!  Mongolian beef was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Solid, tasty, friendly neighborhood Chinese food with off-menu Szechuan skills. Very reasonable prices make you want to order more than one dish per person. Will make brown rice for you if you call ahead 60mins before arrival.

Really impressed by the Szechuan Chicken (not on the menu) - perfect spice, complex flavor, and very good quality ingredients. Tastes like home-cooking, and the food is good-looking and colorful with fresh vegetables. Kung Pao Chicken (on the menu) is similar to the Szechuan, and is also made with generous slices of white meat chicken. We ate our food there, but from the looks of it, this would be really good take-out and would heat up well the next day. We ate our entire plates clean, really quickly. 

Looking forward to trying a lot of other stuff on the menu. Don't be fooled by the unassuming storefront, this place is as good as China One, if not better and definitely more authentic (and friendly goes a long way.)

Thanks to fellow Yelpers for their trailblazing on this shop. A small UYE would pack this joint, as there are only 4 or 5 tables (maybe 20ppl max?)..."}
{"text":"This place always puts me in good spirits. The food is DELICIOUS! the owner is wonderful. She is a sweet lady who remembers everyone and remembers everyone's order. She works extremely hard and has a kind spirit. I always order the lunch special which is like $7. I get orange chicken, 3 crab ragoons, fried rice, and egg drop soup. So so good."}
{"text":"my favorite place to eat chinese food on my lunch break :) General Tso & house special chicken, yum!! friend service too"}
{"text":"I didn't even get to try the food. I tried to order delivery, the first time I called they hung up on me without saying anything. The second time I called in they said they only deliver within 2 miles and hung up on me again."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place based on reviews & the fact it's right around the corner from me!! First the service is amazing & second the food is the best!!! Can't beat the prices either, they give you a pretty large portion. I ordered a combo plate of beef & broccoli and for $7.55, are they kidding me?!! It's like a full size order with fried rice, egg roll, wonton and a fried shrimp. Also got an order of garlic shrimp that has plenty of shrimp & veggies. Very, very good!! I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Best mom and pops Chinese in the city! And man is it hard to find a good spot for Chinese even with the Health Districts favorite row of restaurants on Spring Mtn./Chinatown.
Food is consistently hot, fresh, flavorful and comes with an amazing price.
The place itself is small with only a few tables but you won't loose quality taking it home-which we always do.
Love love love this place and so will you!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious!  BoBo is not a five star or even a four star restaurant by any means. The people there tend to be short and to the point BUT the food is delicious and probably the cheapest you will find in town. This place is definitely a locals only secret for sure."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! First time here & I'm definitely coming back!!! Had the chicken Pad Thai & my friends had Kung Pao shrimp & Sweet & Sour chicken & all had very good flavor! Get a Thai tea too :)"}
{"text":"Came here with classmates during fall semester and it was really delicious. The portions were very generous, more than what we could eat.  Not a lot of seating so would recommend take out. We just got lucky that day and was able to get the big table. Overall,  we plan on returning during our spring semester."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Fast food hands down!! Great service and great prices. Cant beat the deals they have for the amount of food they give you!  
YOU won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten my whole entire life !! The service was amazing the owner she was so polite and sweet I felt like I've been going there my entire life!! The sweet and sour soup was the most delicious soup I ever had it was just perfect and it tasted so healthy!! The lemon  chicken was delicious as well !! I can't describe in words how delicious the food is I promise you must try it I'll be going again soon very soon I will be a regular"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fried rice, beef and broccoli and shrimp chow mein. Everything tastes great! & the owner here is so nice! She gave me free soup while I waited on my to go food. & even offered to wash my daughters bottle when she dropped it. Great customer service , great food & great prices! Thank you."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I will differently return soon. My friend and I always come to Bobo's when we are in town. I tell all my friends about this place."}
{"text":"No complaints. The staff very friendly and welcoming. This little hole in the wall is a hidden gem.
 Reasonably  priced. Food is fresh and very flavorful. 
This is our go to place for good Chinese food.
I really enjoyed the Kung Pao shrimp....DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I love discovering small businesses like this one! It's a total hole in the wall, but offers extremely affordable lunch specials from 11-3pm. They also offer a cheap $7 all day pricing menu! You won't find anything over $10 here! This place is a neighborhood staple when we're looking for fast and satisfying Chinese food. 

Lunch specials range from $5-$6, they come with your entree, complimentary soup (dine-in only), half low mein and half simple egg fried rice. We always receive hospitable service from the owner Shelly, she's very sweet and quirky. She treats you like a regular right from the start. If you order takeout and arrive before the food is ready, she'll bring out fried wontons and soup for you to enjoy while you wait. She also offers these treats as complimentary appetizers when you dine in.

Here's what I've tried:
*Walnut shrimp $8.95 - the classic Chinese/American guilty pleasure. They use really plump and juicy shrimp here which never taste frozen. It's cooked to crisp perfection and the flavor is always delicious! 5/5

*Combination/ House fried rice $6.50 - it comes with tender chicken, plump shrimp, fluffy egg and vegetables. It's moist, flavorful and pairs perfectly with most of the items on the menu! 4/5

*Egg flower soup $4.95 - Hot and comforting! The right consistency and also lots of silky egg ribbons throughout! 5/5

*Crab Rangoon $4.50 (6 pieces) - Classic and tasty. Fried just right and filled with lots of creamy and flavorful cream cheese filling. 4/5

*House special chicken ($4.95 lunch special) - lightly breaded chicken, fried to golden brown and then topped with their house special garlic sauce. It reminds me of a fusion Chinese/Hawaiian katsu. It gets soggy quick though so maybe not my first choice. 3/5

We like this place and always recommend it to friends looking for a cheap fix! Portions aren't massive but it's usually enough to share between 2 - the quality & flavor really make up for it! 

PRO TIP: They are closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The chashu in the pork fried rice is extremely fresh, not the fried up chunks you usually see at Chinese places. The sesame chicken has never disappointed me.. it's perfectly breaded, fried, and have never bit into a weird piece"}
{"text":"You know those hole in the wall places that are so elusive but that you love finding? This place is one of those. The 5-star is for:
1) great food
2) exceptional value
3) hyper local atmosphere
4) friendly, attentive staff

This seems to be a small family restaurant and everyone seems to know each other. Everyone talks to each other. Fun and engaging.

$4.99 lunch special is a little appalling honestly; I don't know how they can do it. Pot stickers were awesome. Volcano shrimp was awesome. I don't think you can go wrong here. Orange chicken was perfectly battered...I think you get the point.

Go.Eat.Enjoy.Repeat

Peace!"}
{"text":"The only place I have found in Vegas that makes excellent Chinese food. I have never had a bad meal. It is a tiny place so it's not built for a big group. Shelley knows how picky I am and always makes my order special to my needs. Can't go wrong with the lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the manager is awesome. Small place but great special's and good place for a quick bite that will satisfy your Chinese food cravings."}
{"text":"We've lived here about a year and half and had seen this place right next to our house but never stopped in until tonight, and boy do I wish we had gone sooner! Amazing prices, excellent food, fantastic service! They have all day combination plates that are a very good portion, complete with soup and a little variety plate of tasters. I had the Orange chicken combo plate with fried rice. Definitely one of the better orange chickens I've had. It was very flavorful and hearty, while also light and fresh. My husband had the Hot & Sour soup, which I tasted and it was very good. He really enjoyed it! We both left completely satisfied and looking forward to our next trip. We'll be back soon!

**Update: went back a couple days later to try the Wor Wonton Soup- excellent! Also had the General Tso's Chicken combination plate, my husband had the Kung Pao Chicken combination plate. All the food was delicious, very fresh and made to order. So glad we found this spot! New local favorite!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas! The owners run it and make sure everything is fresh and value their customers. They're family now!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. It is always fresh tasting and the tase is wonderful.  I am happy I found the perfect place for excellent food and cleanliness."}
{"text":"It's a hole on the wall, but truthfully sometimes those are the best restaurants.  I was craving good Chinese food, I found this place on yelp. After reading reviews I decided to go with my husband and kids. I was expecting a bigger place, the restaurant has only 6 tables. 1- sits 6 ppl, 2-sits 4 and 2-sits 2ppl. It was empty when we walked in, we got to pick and choose the table we wanted. The waiter was very nice, she gave us water right away and waited for us to make up are mind.  I did noticed a lot of orders over the phone. They were very busy with all the phone orders. 

We decided to try the pork wontons, Mongolian beef, sizzling rice with shrimp, low main with chicken and vegetables. They give you complementary egg drop soup and it's delicious. I liked everything I had, except for the sizzling rice. It was ok, I'm was not crazy about. It might just be me but not my favorite. However; everything else we had it was great. The best part is that it's very inexpensive and delicious. We paid $34.32 including 3 sodas. We will be back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is as good as ever. We moved to Henderson & we weren't able to come to this amazing restaurant anymore. Shelley, the owner, still remembered us after all this time. Her memory never fades! 

The food was as amazing as ever. It really did not disappoint! The atmosphere was the same. It had a very welcoming, family feel to the place. Everything came out fast and everything tasted fresh. We order the usual stuff that we've ordered for years, honey walnut shrimp and orange chicken. Shelley even mentioned that we always order the same exact thing lol. 

They except both cash and card, but I encourage  you to pay with cash. Just to support a local business :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese in Vegas. Great food and amazing service."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is great.  Cheap, fresh and delicious Chinese food right by us.  The value is beyond fantastic ($4.95 lunch specials with fried rice and $6.95 dinner specials, amazing in 2018) and so many items on the menu are great.  I'm a big beef with broccoli fan but I'm eager to try some of the spicier options too.

Also, the lady who owns the place is hilarious, she's very talkative and sassy, remembers what you order and adds/removes ingredients based on your preferences.  For examples, with my B&B I like more bamboo shoots and less water chestnuts and she took care of it without even asking me (she noticed the first time I had it, talk about attention to detail).  The egg flower soup is terrific too and she'll make giant bowls of it for only $5.  All the locals seem to know this place well and are friends with the owner, and often while you eat there they'll be striking up conversations with her. 

This is one of the coolest local diamond in the rough restaurants I've ever seen with a staff that really cares about the residents and repeat customers.  It'll be our go-to Chinese place for a very long time."}
{"text":"Awesome place-really reasonably priced.  Not the BEST Chinese food I've ever had, but pretty good. Their hostess is really friendly & the food never takes too long to come out. Good lo mein, pepper steak, fried rice & eggdrop soup. Their egg rolls are yummy too! This is a good place if you're looking for some lazy day takeout."}
{"text":"FOOD 5/5: Enjoyed the beef and broccoli combo and the general tso's chicken combo. The beef in the beef and broccoli combo was ultra tender and flavorful. I loved the water chestnuts and the bamboo pieces in the dish! My boyfriend always orders either orange chicken or general tso's chicken at Chinese take out restaurants and he says that this is the one here is the absolute best he's ever had. The chicken they use is only white meat and the outside is very crispy. You know how you normally feel really weighed down and heavy after eating Chinese take out? You won't get that feeling here because the food and ingredients used are such high quality and prepared very well. 

SERVICE 5/5: Our combo also came with the egg drop soup and if this hasn't been reiterated in the reviews enough already, it was amazing! The woman who took our order (owner?) was super helpful and recommended we add chili oil and white pepper to the soup which took it next level. She also asked if we liked hot mustard and brought some out for us to try with the fried items (egg roll/crab rangoon/fried shrimp) in our combo. She customized the hot mustard for us by adding chili oil to this as well along with soy sauce which was MONEY. Our complimentary water cups were always refilled without needing to ask. 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I've always left other Chinese take out restaurants feeling like my Chinese food craving was satisfied but never felt that it was amazing - similar to how you feel when you just need your junk food fix. But this place definitely takes the cake for me and my search for amazing Chinese take out has come to an end with Bobo China."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there. Amazing!! Price, quality and flavor. Probably the best that I have ever had. For anyone in the mood for a great Chinese lunch you won't be disappointed. I will definitely be back. Jeff A"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have ordered here twice now and love it!

The first time we sat in the dining area. Our server was funny and nice. She took care of our orders quickly. I felt very welcomed and enjoyed my broccoli and beef combo meal. Yum!

The second time I ordered carry out to pick up on the way home from work. Again, my order was all ready to go. I ordered the chicken and broccoli this time, and again, it was delicious! (: the same server/cashier was there and helped me out that night because of my silly self left my wallet at home before work! (That's another story for another time)

I've never had someone at a fast food Chinese restaurant be so considerate like she was!! I recommend eating and ordering from Boba!!"}
{"text":"We love this place, it's our go to Chinese takeout. Food is great and the owner is hilarious."}
{"text":"To satisfy my desire for shrimp egg foo young I looked for a Chinese restaurant close to home. BoBo China satisfied my criteria. It was listed with a 4 1/2 star rating and was close by. Good choice. Excellent shrimp Egg Foo Young to go and while I waited the complimentary egg drop soup distracted my hunger pains. The service was good and friendly. And the Egg Foo Young --authentic from the gravy to the crispy, fried skin."}
{"text":"My spicy since was tingling when I saw Bobo out of the corner of my eye and it was 10/10 the orange chicken is to die for and everything is authentic for extremely good prices I highly recommend"}
{"text":"PUT A MENU ONLINE!

FB page doesn't work - hurting takeout business!"}
{"text":"One of our regular delivery spots. Love the fried shrimp, cream cheese crab wontons, kung pao chicken, and orange chicken! Fast delivery. Order is always correct. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Smells appetizing in here!!!

Worth the wait.  Our chicken dishes were cooked extra fresh since they ran outta chicken from their most popular Orange Chicken plate.  I later learned General Tso's chicken is another variation of orange chicken.  And so we contributed to their loss of wanted protein.  Go figure how they run out though...  All day plate combos $6.99 to $7.99.

While waiting for my to go order, the super nice lady served me egg flower soup with crunchy wontons.  It was nice and warm for the hungry stomach.  Too funny also, when food was ready she didn't say, \"Thanks for waiting.\"  She said, \"Here. Now go home! Go and feed somebody at home!\"  Hahahaaaaa needed that laugh when really I know, she knows, that customers know, she needs a restful break. 

Four F's and for my personal gratitude; fresh cooked food, friendly, funny, five stars *****."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Chinese food in Las Vegas!  My mom and dad drive pretty far to get their food from here, and my husband and I can't wait to go there when we are in town. The owners are very special people who care for their customers, and have great foot to boot!"}
{"text":"I was craving some Chinese food when I came across this place. I'm so happy I stopped in! I got the Mongolian pork lunch special. It can with an egg roll, fried shrimp, cream cheese Rangoon, soup, fried or steamed rice, and my entree... for $7! That's a lot of food at a great price! But what was more impressive was the fresh quality food that was served! It was hot off the stove when it was served! The flavor of the pork was so delicious! I couldn't stop eating it! The cream cheese Rangoon was upsetting, that I only got ONE! It's by far the tastiest one over ever had! The egg drop soup was delicious too, it had so much flavor! I'm definitely excited to have found this place."}
{"text":"First and foremost the service was excellent. The food was good. Better than average  entry for Chinese food and best when eaten fresh. There is not a lot of seating though. Would go there again if I was in the area. I would give it 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times since moving to Vegas, and I'm not sure if I could go elsewhere! The amazing food and how fast your meal is delivered to you...plus the amazing prices! I can tell I will be a regular for years to come. Looking forward to my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"I live nearby. I eat here as often as possible. I feed my clients here. Everyone loves it. My employees, as well. The Walnut Shrimp is of the charts and my personal favorite. But the quality of ingredients and culinary skill in this place makes every dish some of the best take-out I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food! The prices are great! The service  is great! 

A coworker told me about this place and showed me the menu... I saw they had Sizzling Rice Soup! Not since I was 11 I have had this soup! Great childhood memories started flashing back! 

Friends and I ordered Kung Pao Shrimp, Sizzling Rice Shrimp,Chicken fried rice , so much yummyness! 


The food was great! Probably the best Chinese I have had in a while! Shelli is so awesome! 

Next time I will try the Thai Tea! Heard thats great! This place is 20 minutes of a drive at least from home and I will totally drive here Every time I get the urge!"}
{"text":"Real imitation Chinese food otherwise known as American Chinese! Had orange chicken which was decent and not too heavy on the breading. Think of a large chicken nugget sliced and slathered w orange sauce. Also got chicken teriyaki which was questionable in flavor but same chicken nugget base. I am giving a 3rd star because the woman helping as was so friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood. I really like the food but I LOVE the service. We've been going here for years and the owner knows my number and my favorite order."}
{"text":"Bobo China looks like your typical take out Chinese spot, but on the couple nights we've stopped by there's been several locals dining in. Maybe the draw is the good food or friendly service where the owners seem to know all their customers. Either way, this place is a step up from most other spots of its kind. Beef chow fun ($8.95) was mild in flavor, but still good with plenty of beef, onions, green onions and noodles. Portion sizes for the pan fried noodles were equally as large. Noodles were extra crispy, just how I like it with veggies, chicken and shrimp covered in a light sauce. They also offer combo plates which come with an egg roll, crab rangoon, fried shrimp, and rice. The cashew chicken combo, in particular, was quite good."}
{"text":"We went in and had the dinner specials that comes with soup, egg roll, Rangoon and a piece of fried shrimp. We had the orange chicken, beef broccoli, sweet and sour chicken and ma po tofu. Everything was excellent and very well priced."}
{"text":"This is the kind of Chinese take-out place you expect find in a place, say like Kansas, where you imagine there are only one or two Chinese people in the whole state.

The food is not bad, but in Las Vegas that's not good enough. Yea, it close by and they deliver, so there is the whole convenience thing, but you would better served by driving a few miles to Chinatown, where you WILL get good Chinese. 

Good Chinese is just one of those things that can never be compromised."}
{"text":"I adore this place, and most especially I adore the matron owner who I lovingly refer to as Madam Mao. I am continually disappointed with the Chinese food in Las Vegas. Vegas has some great Asian food, but for some reason Chinese food is often little better than fast food quality, or chain style Americanized Chinese. Sadly, after visiting China a couple of times I have become a Chinese food snob. 

Welp, Bobo satisfies my Northern Chinese food needs. The quality of the food is fresh and well made. The meals have a a good, strong, Chinese flavor. The meats are not over cooked and the veggies remain crisp. The sauces are succulent and not full of sugar which is so often he case in American Chinese food. For the food alone it is worth the trip across town. Couple this with the fact the proprietor hasn't raised prices in more than 6 years. You can get in an out with a huge delicious meal for two people for less than $25. 

There is a down side. The dining room is tiny. Just four tables. Most of their business is takeout. They do a brisk take out business so you have to be wiling to wait for your main dishes as they only have one cook and one server. 

Speaking of the service, the proprietor is a bit of an acquired taste. Some might view her as abrupt with little tolerance for indecisive customers, but I adore her. She can cast a disappointing gaze in your direction if she is not happy with you. However, she is also very kind and rewarding if you are a good guest. She has an excellent memory for good guest which has helped her create a very loyal customer base. Half the reason I enjoy eating there is because of my totally inappropriate crush on Madam Mao and loving sternness. 

if you are craving Chinese it is worth a trip to check out. You might not get a seat right away, and you might get dirty looks from Madam Mao if you decide to wait instead of just ordering the food to go, but the food and for show are the best you are going to get for the price."}
{"text":"Just picked up a little Mongolian beef and Lo Mein dinner special (not on dinner menu but paying a little extra will get you special order). I just want to say that this totally hit the spot. Just ridiculous. The beef is super tender and full of flavor. I knew I had a craving for a reason. Thank you so much!!

Also, I want to note that this is my \"Go-To\" spot for a quick and delicious meal. The owners offer a $4.95 lunch special that includes an entrée, a side (fried rice) and an egg drop soup (dine-in only), I believe. The all day $6.95 special offers an entrée, a side (fried rice and lo mein combo I believe), one spring roll, one fried shrimp, cream cheese rangoon, a baggies of fried wontons and a soup (dine-in only). It is a massive amount of tasty food for a low price. I come here quite often and have gotten to know the owner very well, she is my favorite person Ever and for a buck or so more, she will customize my all day special with lo mein instead of rice and two spring rolls instead of all the other fried stuff. 

I love supporting this business and while it is not a fancy or a big place by any means, I feel more welcomed and appreciated here than at any other food joint I've ever been to in Vegas (and I've eaten this entire city many-a times over). I'm always engaged in a conversation and humor, which is definitely not a normal occurrence in Asian or ethnic food joint. 

PLEASE support these wonderful people, stop by and enjoy their awesome specials as well as rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"I've been here probably about 6 times or so. Its most definitely good for Chinese take-out food. Shelly, the server, is a nice woman that remembers your name and makes useful suggestions if you are stuck.The food is reasonably price for the amount that they give you, and the past couple times she has given me complimentary soup while I waited for my take out. So rather than stopping at Panda Express or another generic Chinese cuisine place, stop by Bobo China and enjoy."}
{"text":"Bobo China was all right, but I would probably not go back.  We ordered shrimp fried rice and chicken lo mein.  The chicken lo mein tasted okay, but the shrimp fried rice looked and tasted pretty meh.  There were barely any shrimp or flavor.  It felt like we were just eating brown rice.

The lady who took our order was very nice.  She was friendly and kind of humorous.  

Maybe the other menu items taste better.  Everyone else here on Yelp seems to love this place."}
{"text":"I had this when I first moved here 3 years ago and it chow me in was super greasy. Also the fried rice has way too much soy sauce. I'm a Chinese food lover so I can't really give this place one star. But maybe I should. Eh."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food my family and I have had! We were looking for an authentic Chinese food place and that is exactly what it is. The orange chicken is the best we have ever had!"}
{"text":"Bobo China baby! 

Fresh! Tasty! Generous! Wok! 

Fantastic service!!! 

I have eaten here many times, take out and dine in! Is great either way! 

I love my FREE cup of egg drop soup while I am waiting for my takeout order! 

Garlic chicken is really good! 

Crab Rangoons! MMMMM Yes order these tasty critters as an addition to your meal! 

They also have great dinner combos that include, a jumbo fried shrimp, egg roll and crab rangoon! Can't go wrong! Filling for a great price! 

I have to thank my Yelper sis Nikki H. for introducing me to this great find! 

Great food and great service every time I visit, you can't go wrong! 

You will be hooked once you try it!"}
{"text":"To start off, I give this restaurant 3.5 stars. I am basing this on the best Chinese food I have ever had. Loved the potstickers. The Chicken with garlic sauce was good. The egg flower soup, some of the best I have had. Reason: wasn't overly thick and had a really light but tasty flavor-egg was present but fluid. The shrimp fried rice was bland and missing something; unfortunately it was the shrimp. The orange chicken was really good. There wasn't too much breading and the flavor spot on. One unfortunate thing-forgot soy sauce for a take out Chinese order, even though I requested it twice. The lady at the counter-was good people."}
{"text":"I found this place when i was trying to go any chinese place near by.

Here sweet and sour pork is the best !!
People should try sweet and sour pork !!!"}
{"text":"The nicest lady serving the food. And the best chef in the back making it. Can't complain. Especially getting the ABSOLUTE BEST $5 lunch in town. Try it."}
{"text":"I tried that boba drink...wow amazing taste me and my wife really enjoyed thank you so much and would be back again and referral your restaurant to anyone good customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I love Chinese food and can't believe I didn't find this place sooner! We've never had a dish we didn't love...even their chicken wings! It's family owned and operated. The lady who runs it is nice, funny, and very informative about the menu. They only make things with fresh ingredients. We have become regulars  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Well, it's 4 years since my last review, this time I ate on the premises.  Same counter person was there if my memory is not failing me, and she's as nice as she was 4 years ago.  I took a pass on the egg drop soup (hot n' sour kind of guy), ordered the pepper steak and potstickers.  Both were good and solid.  Yea, I'd definitely make a return visit.

btw, there are only 4 or 5 tables in the place, and looks like they use 1 or 2 for prep work, so seating is limited."}
{"text":"My bf and I moved here from the East coast where we've had amazing Chinese food.  Being Chinese, my bf was craving authentic Chinese food.  Based on the yelp reviews, we chose to go here, NEVER again, we got food poisoning from here just from the fried rice!"}
{"text":"Seriously so good and the prices are great!! We went last night and already want to go back today but unfortunately Sundays are closed, but we will see you Monday sweet and sour chicken!!"}
{"text":"I visit my dad in Las Vegas twice a year for a few weeks each time. In the 20 or so years, I could not find a Chinese restaurant with a GOOD egg flower soup (we call it egg drop on the east coast) that had flavor and not the peas, carrots, whatever added. Not only is the soup good, the meal was great!  It was worth the 7 mile trip.  My wife and I had the cashew chicken which was outstanding.  Dad very much enjoyed the shrimps in lobster sauce.

It's small store front restaurant, clean, with about 7 tables, doesn't look like much on the outside.  The owner was very cordial and even laughed at my 85 year old dad's jokes.  Looking forward to our next trip to Las Vegas, we'll be coming back to Bobo."}
{"text":"Love this place. Don't let the look fool you. The food is very good. We went their on Yelp reviews an were very pleased.  It's a  small place with only 3 tables as they do  alot of take out.  But we have always eaten there. The service is great. The girl there always makes us laugh. She now knows us when we come in an already knows what we want. The orange chicken is yummmmmy as well as the kung pow. Love the fried rice. The combination plates are they way to go. Very reasonable an you get your sides with it. I try to have something new every time an I have yet to be disappointed.  like I said the food is very good an everything is very fresh. This has become our favorite place.  Traditional Chinese food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm really conflicted about this place.  The food was good, but not that much better than any other take out in my general area.  We ate in which also colors my review.

The first thing that struck me when we went in was how messy every table was.  At that point, I asked my wife if she wanted to do take out instead, but she said we'd wait.  A gentleman who just finished his complimentary egg drop soup while he was waiting for his takeout, got up from his table and offered it to us.  It was at this time that the woman showed up.  She cleaned off the table and we were seated by the door.

From then, it was a bit of a wait for her to cover the few tables in the place, answer the phone, and give take out orders to people as they came in.  After a fair amount of time--nothing outrageous--she came to take our order.  My wife wanted the garlic chicken.  I wanted the pork with garlic sauce which was listed on the menu as hot and spicy.  She questioned each of us on what type of vegetables we liked.  I didn't understand this, but when I ordered, I guess she assumed we would be sharing and since my wife already had ordered a garlic dish, I wouldn't want the same.  Again, a discussion of what kind of vegetables I liked.  She then suggested I get one of two other pork dishes.  I ended up ordering the twice cooked pork.  I really didn't come for a discussion on vegetables as well intentioned as that might have been.

We got a complimentary cup of egg drop soup which was good.  My wife liked her chicken with garlic sauce and I liked my twice cooked pork, but it wasn't spicy.  And, during the meal, I couldn't help look at the table ahead and to my left where every dirty dish from every other table ended up for a temporary home, but they stayed there during the hour plus we were in the restaurant.  I realize it's a mom and pop operation but when there are only 4 tables, it becomes an issue.

I liked the woman.  She was quite friendly and had a good sense of humor.  If I come back, it will be for takeout only and I'll call in advance.  I think I've sworn off Chinese food in the neighborhood.  I'll stick to Thai food and get Chinese in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. Maybe I am just missing something about Chinese food. I can't find a place in Vegas that gives me the wow factor. I like spicy and it wasn't spicy at all. To be honest I think it tastes better the next day. Had good flavors and the lady was a Super cool waitress. She definitely has regulars who visit there. Kung PAw Chicken was differnt.  Guess on to the next place."}
{"text":"Decided to come try this place out since we don't have any food in our fridge at the moment and it was well worth it. The server was really entertaining and nice. We got the honey walnut shrimp, general Tso chicken and Mongolian beef and it was all really good."}
{"text":"The best family owned Chinese restaurant in the Lakes area. I found this place 6 years ago. The prices are great and the food is even  better. The owner, Shelly, has a fantastic memory and remembers what you ordered the next time you come in. This restaurant has 4 tables and does a huge volume of take out. Although there are Chinese restaurants that are closer, I drive the 1/2 hour from my neighborhood to dine. The sauces are fresh and each dish tastes differently seasoned. The lunch portions are generous. Shelly and her husband are from China. The checks will be handwritten in Chinese."}
{"text":"Warning 1- 6:30 pm, no customers. 
Warning 2- Waitress noticed thar one of the person in our group is Cinese and kind of \"hint\" us that this is not the restaurant for true Chinese.  

Result: 3 of us got really sick after dinner. Will not go again! 
Don't easily believe any \"good\" review on yelp."}
{"text":"First time here. Yelp reviews made me decide this is the place to go. I Ordered takeout. Kung Pao and Beef and Broccoli meal size. Very good and great value. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"Do not judge this place by its looks! 

Food was excellent. Fast, cooked to order, and delicious. And extremely cheap!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a bite...The food is delish... Shelly the owner is sassy and sweet, great customer service, the food is always hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Ordered shrimp fried rice to go and cashier served me a cup of egg drop soup while I waited. Absolutely delicious and great prices!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. I come here for the lunch special. Great sweet and sour chicken. The lady is also very friendly and engaging. Makes you feel very welcome! The service is very quick. Less than 5 minutes to get the food out. The food itself is delicious and flavorful. Portion size is more than enough, and I'm a big eater!"}
{"text":"Shelley is the sweetest she even offered me soup free of charge while I was waiting for my order. Will definitely return in the future :) thanks Shelley!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I walked up to this establishment with hesitation. My co-workers don't have the greatest taste in food and I was walking in blind (hadn't checked the Yelp). It looks a bit sketchy from the outside, but usually the hole in the walls are decent. So in I walked while quickly scanning reviews.

It's located on Sahara in the Smart & Final shopping center a couple businesses down from the Biscuits Café. 

One of my co-workers has been frequenting this joint for 6 years is what I've been told. So the nice lady did not bother to give her a menu because she was getting the usual. I quickly scanned until I found the lunch specials. Lunch specials include your entrée choice, soup, low mein and fried or steamed rice. I decided to go with the Cashew nuts chicken and steamed rice. She provided us with a Styrofoam cup of arrowhead water that she kept cold and full the entire time. I wasn't totally keeping track, but the soup came first only about 2-5 minutes after taking our order and the food followed maybe 5-10 minutes after the soup. Food was extremely hot and totally delicious. I actually had to let it cool off before I stuffed my face. The one thing that stuck out the most for me was the chicken. It wasn't chewy and rubbery like I normally find while eating Chinese food. There was plenty of food in each portion, so much that I couldn't finish mine completely. 

There was nothing negative about my visit. Fast, friendly and good food! I'm looking forward to trying it again!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place!!  You can sit and eat your delicious Chinese food. the lady upfront that's been there for years has always the best customer service."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a year now. And they are definitely one of my favorites n the valley . Best deals and of course food. I would definitely recommend the wonton soup ."}
{"text":"Ok, came here based on Yelp reviews.  I was skeptical when I saw the outside and even more so inside.  All the tables were not cleaned when we arrived.  Not hard to do since there are exactly 5 tables to choose from and 1 was taken.  I continued to be skeptical.  The prices were better than reasonable.  They were quite low.  What's up with this place?  

I order the cashew chicken combination, my husband ordered the broccoli beef and our son ordered the chicken lo mein.  We had water to drink.  Water was served from an Arrowhead gallon jug.  Still skeptical...

As we waited for our meal numerous people came and went.  I then realized this was a popular local take out place.  The tables were only there for the few of us who aren't there for take out. I started counting.  4 people dropped in before we got our meal.  Another 6 came while we ate and 2 more while we visited after dinner.  This is a local hot spot for take out and let me explain why.

For 6.99 each we ordered combination plates. With our meal came our entree, fried or steamed rice, 1 egg roll, 1 crab/cream cheese stuffed won ton. 1 fried shrimp and soup.

All our meals arrived hot and one at a time.  These dishes are cooked to order fast and fresh.  The chicken and beef were super tender and sliced thin so sauce was coated on each perfectly,  the flavors were amazing and the texture of the ingredients were so fresh.  The chicken cashew had lots of cashews, water chestnuts, onions, peppers and carrots.  It was so good.  The broccoli beef had water chestnuts, onions, bamboo shoots...  Nothing was less than fresh and hot.

This place earned every star they get.  I highly recommend this little spot for a great meal."}
{"text":"This is a great little Chinese place tucked away in a strip mall. Great prices, generous portions, and quality ingredients.  I had the all day combo plate and it was cheap, tasty, and filling. The chef has been cooking for 40 years. They have a couple tables, but they mostly do takeout. Will return again!"}
{"text":"I needed to grab Chinese takeout on my way home and saw that this place had good ratings, and I love trying new places, so I decided to give it a try. It was a hole-in-the-wall place, which seemed like a good omen. The lady behind the counter was super friendly! She gave me the soup of the day while I waited and chatted with me a bit. 

I ordered the orange chicken combo and the beef & broccoli combo. The fried rice was delicious! The broccoli in the beef & broccoli was perfect- not too soggy. The orange chicken was a little sweet for my taste, but my husband loved it. The combos also came with fried shrimp, egg rolls, and wontons, which were all delicious! I didn't even have leftovers for lunch"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese restaurant we've ever been to. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! The owner has a great sense of humor & very warm personality. The food comes out so fast, hot & is delicious. She is very attentive & friendly. The prices are ridiculously reasonable for large portions. Can't go wrong with the daily deals. Can't wait to come back & try other entrees!"}
{"text":"Great prices friendly staff and good food. Ordered take out and could see them transfer the food straight from the cooking pan to the takeout box!!!"}
{"text":"Located in Smiths Shipping Center. Plenty of parking. This place gets busy during dinner time. Dine in or ToGo. Delivery 

BoBo China is one of the best in Vegas! I've been coming here for 3 years and the food only gets better. 

Everything is great including my favs, orange chicken, egg foo young, salt and pepper fish (to die for), egg rolls, BBQ pork, shrimp lo-mein, fried rice, egg flower soup....it's all yummy. 

Plus they have to nicest, sweetest owners. Husband and Wife duo. Shelley is so personable. It's always a pleasure to stop in and chat with Shelley or on those days when I don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Have ordered from them before without a problem. I had to meet the minimum requirement of $15.00 for delivery so I added a few items to my order. I live walking distance to this restaurant as it's next to my local Smith's grocery store. The woman on the phone was very rude and tried to argue her Mapquest location that I was a mile away. I definitely am not as I walk about five blocks and cross the street to get there. After her rudeness, I was put off and didn't feel comfortable receiving any food from them and couldn't believe there wasn't a care in the world to being polite or trying to attempt great customer service given that I am a repeat customer who has ordered from them several times before. This woman wanted to argue with me. I called back and cancelled my order. She didn't seem to care. I got a \"OK I will cancel, bye\".  It's only a matter of time before they go out of business if this is how they treat not only customers, but repeat customers."}
{"text":"I was craving cheap, and delicious comfort food, so when I saw this small Chinese joint nearby, I had to try it! It was 6pm when I stopped by, so I couldn't get the best deal on the menu, which were the lunch specials that they have for $5! Although I did have a combo special, and I ordered orange chicken, and every item under the combo special comes with steamed or fried rice, an egg roll, fried shrimp and soup! Mind you, this is all for $7, and it was so good! The lady that helped us was very friendly, and spoke with guests who were regulars, she knew what they wanted when they came in! She didn't hold back either, she'll tell you what to try, and if you don't eat all of what's on your plate, be prepared for her to say something! All in all, the food was great, the prices were great, and the staff had personality! Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! My husband and I were looking for a good Chinese place and this definitely hit the spot. We got the pork fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, beef and broccoli, and walnut shrimp. It was a lot of food and I ate way too much but I couldn't stop eating it was just too good! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Vegas, hands down. Every dish is absolutely delicious AND a good deal. If you have never been here you should try it right away."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've had in Vegas for awhile. We had the lunch special. I got the sweet and sour chicken. It came with fried rice, a fried shrimp, a crab Rangoon, an egg roll, and a cup of soup. Everything was delicious. Good quality chicken."}
{"text":"This place is very small... definitely isn't very pleasant.. the lady that orders the food and answers the phones.... is quite uneasy to talk too... I asked to order a couple of things a certain way... and she was not having it...  she insisted that the way she cooks her food is the only way u can have it... I SAID I WOULD NOT LIKE MSG, AND I WOULD LIKE MY EGGROLLS CRISPY... she said no im not cooking it that way... its considered over cooked... im giving this place this rating because the food wasnt bad.. but im sooo not ever coming back..."}
{"text":"The lady here is AMAZING!! I came here once about a year ago and the fact that she remembered me is phenomenal. Not only is the customer service amazing, food is BOMB!!! I got the orange chicken combination plate with an egg roll, cream cheese wonton, fried shrimp for $7 and a side of potstickers for $5. Everything was so good! My favorite chinese place from now on"}
{"text":"I almost didn't want to leave a review because I wanna keep this amazing spot to myself. But this is definitely a little hole in the wall that leads to Mama's kitchen! Plus I've never been anywhere with $5 full size lunch specials! Honey walnut shrimp is $8 or $9 and most Chinese places charge a few bucks more. Only down side is that it's super small, 5 tables total. It seats 4, 4, 2, 2, and maybe 5-6 on the bigger table. It wasn't busy when we went so I'm not sure if this place ever gets packed or not. But this was definitely a great find that I'll be returning to."}
{"text":"Since I just moved to the area I have been scouting out new places to eat. Stumbled upon Bobo China and OH MAN, I am glad I did.   The food was amazingly delish!  Shelly was extremly helpful accomodating my requesst for NO MSG.  My food prepaired fresh, served promptly with Shelly's flair for humor.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for Chisese food!  Thank you for you commitment to quality food and excellent service.. See you guys again for SURE.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved in around the neighborhood and thank god we found this gem! Our new go to Chinese food place.

You can't beat the prices! For $6.99 you can get a dinner special which includes soup (dine in only), an egg roll, a fried shrimp, a crab Rangoon, rice and main entree choice. I choose the orange chicken which was delicious! The breading was crispy and just the right amount of batter and the sauce was great without too much orange flavor. My boyfriend had the sweet and sour chicken which looked good too. They also provided us with extra spicy sauce in case we needed it.

The service was also top notch! They're super friendly and like to make jokes with you. That alone makes me want to come back all the time. 

Almost place! So glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Chinese takeout and I checked out the reviews and all were pretty great! Soo glad I checked this place out! The food was amazing!! While waiting for my order, the nice girl that worked there gave me a bowl of Egg Drop Soup, which tasted soo good! I opted for the Orange Chicken combo meal with steamed rice. It came with an spring roll, a crab puff and cream cheese type wonton. Soo good! The meal size and price were just right and everything tasted fantastic! Def will recommend and return in the future! Thanks BoBo China!"}
{"text":"Decent food and good prices. Nothing too extraordinary as far as flavor but good value. For $6.99 the dinner special included an entree, veggie roll, crab rangoon, fried rice, soup and one fried shrimp. 
The service was quick and friendly, but the place only has four tables so it can fill up fast if you're dining in. Overall, a good place to try for a quick cheap meal!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little casual place.  But styrofoam cups?  The front desk is a little messy.  I don't know how to describe the decor.  The soup and the beef/broccoli were very good."}
{"text":"I will never ever go to China A Go Go, Panda Express, China One or any other place (besides Bobo China) ever, ever, ever, again. 
My boyfriend and I come here even when we're not hungry. Yeah... it's that great. I get the sesame chicken. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here last night & I love this place! I'm from the east coast and have yet to find any Chinese food restaurant that can compare except this one! The service was great and the woman who was running the place was hilarious. All the food was so fresh and delicious. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is decent. One Of the better picture menu Chinese restaurant out there."}
{"text":"Food: excellent
Service: excellent
Price: excellent

Stoped in next door, saw this place and decided to stop in for lunch. We had beef with broccoli, lo mein, and sweet and sour pork w/ Thai teas. All the combos came with soup, an egg roll, a cream cheese rangoon and a fried shrimp. Everything was fast, fresh and delicious. If we are ever in the area again, we will stop by."}
{"text":"Just moved here and looking for good old Chinese food!! This is the spot!! Great food!! Hardly any tables and very small, go early or do take out!! The reviews on here about the lady upfront....she was nice to us. She made suggestions on ordering, but they were good ones. Prices were great too! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I never get tired of coming here. Best lunch specials around and the service is great!!! I recommend trying this place out at least once and you'll become a regular!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this little place. Everything tastes delicious. The food tastes even better because the owner Shelly is delightful. I appreciate how hard she works and her dry sense of humor. We are headed there now for our tasty Chinese fix"}
{"text":"Deeeeeeeeelish!!  I had the house special, chicken lightly fried with house sauce.  Daughter had sweet sour chicken, both amazing!  Best fried shrimp ever.  Loved the egg drop soup.  Bringing my man back for sure !  Oh, Super nice too."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and priced very cheaply. We ordered the veggie and tofu soup, pad Thai, and the orange chicken combination plate. Was very impressed with the quality of the food. The service was wonderful as well. She noticed that my little sister liked broccoli and put extra broccoli on her plate for the entre. She was so friendly and funny. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"everything was fireeee and shelly was so dope.   got the generals chiccen and it was a fat ass plate"}
{"text":"Ordered the Kung Pao Chicken all day special and was impressed by everything I got. Wonton, Shrimp, Egg Roll, Fried Rice, and obviously my Kung Pao. I would've also got soup but the lady assumed I wasn't staying in so I just decided not to. My only complaint would be that there wasn't much chicken in the Kung Pao Chicken."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant with PHENOMENAL tasting food.  Been here 4 times and EVERY dish I've had has been FANTASTIC!  Bobo's recommendations are superb!  The food is not too salty nor too bland.  Pricing is MORE THAN REASONABLE!  Bobo remembers her customers and their likes and dislikes!  I've had the potstickers, crab rangoon, egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, orange chicken, Cantonese fried noodles, walnut shrimp, and salt-and-pepper pork chop and EVERYTHING HAS BEEN RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS!  

People have given her less stars due to it being small but let that not steer your judgment of the quality of food!  She's been there for 11 years.  

I recommend dropping by and giving it a chance!  I'd eat there daily!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've found in this town and with very reasonable prices! The lady that runs it is hilarious and very friendly.. My only advice is to pick up rather than dine in as the dining area is quite small, other than that it's 5 stars"}
{"text":"The service was very good,  but what we ordered was overall disappointing.  The thai tea did not taste good.   It's as if they made up the recipe and got it wrong, way wrong.  The tea had what I could best describe as an instant creamer taste.   The crab rangoon, fried shrimp, fried rice, steamed rice, and egg roll were good.  But the main entrees were lacking in flavor, and one of the entrees could have been hotter in  temperature."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food because we were turned away because their were no tables to seat us at which is funny because out of the 3 tables there, 2 were occupied and 1 was being reserved.  The service was horrible. We walked in were confronted by an upset angry employee. 

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is great ive been coming here for 6yr now. The food is great as well as the service. Shelly the waitress is super nice."}
{"text":"The Thai Ice Tea lacked flavor & watered down. The Chicken Fried Rice was good and the Walnut Shrimp was okay.. I don't think I'll be coming back. The service was good :)"}
{"text":"WORLD'S BEST! The food is fresh, tasty and always delicious and hot! Great price for lunch and I have used them for catering as well.  Always perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I love it. Great prices, great food and excellent customer service! She remembers me when I come in. Last time I ordered, I mentioned I was going to save some for leftovers and she had them put the sauce separate for me so nothing would get soggy. Very thoughtful."}
{"text":"Had my first visit here a few weeks ago in my search to find a new local chinese spot. Walked in to order and it smelled fantastic inside. Very small place with only 3 or 4 tables. Obviously mostly take-out. The young lady at the counter was very kind and even gave me a cup of Egg Drop soup to try while I waited for my order (I told her I wanted to order soup to-go but they only had one size and it was way to big for me). I usually don't enjoy Egg Drop soup but this one was amazing. I ordered a dinner combination to-go. If I remember correctly I ordered chicken and broccoli (my fav). The food is fair priced and was very good quality as opposed to most chinese hole in the wall places I have gone to. Looking forward to my next visit. Would give 4.5 stars if I could but they get 5 for the server being so kind. Only gripe is I wish the portions were slightly bigger.

Great spot for local take out once you find it. I drove by it once looking for it."}
{"text":"Really good food, very loving people. My experience was awesome and the owner made me a special tea. :) thank you... awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I usually get the shrimp with broccoli and the chicken with broccoli, always with extra ginger and garlic. The food tastes fresh and great authentic NY Chinese flavor. The prices are very reasonable. Shelly the owner remembers your name and how you like your food. When's the last time a restaurant owner remembered your name and how you like your food?! Very fast takeout service. This is an excellent place for takeout and this is from a picky East coast guy who knows good Chinese food."}
{"text":"5 stars for service. Placed an in person takeout order and the waitress have me soup and nice conversation. Will update with food. Nice to go into a place and not be ignored!

EDIT: Had the shrimp kung pao lunch special - delicious. And cheap!"}
{"text":"I owe it to Yelp for helping me find this place. I've been to the Smart and Final and Del Taco a gazillion times, but I never noticed the Bobo China in the same shopping center. Even If I had noticed it, I'm not sure I would have tried it. I am absolutely in love with this place. The lady who always helps me is very nice and pretty sarcastic which is pretty much how I am. 

    I order from here at least once a week. I get pickup and delivery and I'm always pleased either way. If I had to be critical I think one time it wasn't really as hot as it could have been. But that's out of like 20 times ordering so far. Another big note is that delivery is free. That's rare! Obviously you still need to take care of the driver but hopefully that doesn't need to be said. 

    I first had the Egg Drop soup when I was waiting for a pickup order. The lady behind the counter brought it over which was so nice! That little gesture was appreciated. It was delicious. One of the best Egg Drop soups I have had yet. It probably helps that I'm a little plain and there isn't any crazy other ingredients. Since that day I have ordered it several times. It comes in a pretty good sized container. You can definitely share it with at least one other person if not two. They even give you this spicy chili sauce to add to it if you like it spicy. It adds a great spicy kick to an already delicious flavor.

    I also am a fan of their wings. I don't get wings often at chinese restaurants but I have here once or twice. I love the way its breaded.

    Their potstickers and dumplings are delicious as well. I'm not sure the difference between the two here. They were very similar. Maybe just the way they were cooked. 

    I also love their Kung Pao Chicken. It's pretty much what I always order, though I'm tempted to try more things soon.

    And to top it all off the prices are so reasonable. It's the ideal little hole in the wall Chinese takeout spot. Clean, cheap, friendly, and the food is delicious. A big thank you to Yelp for helping me find this place."}
{"text":"Overall I was pleased with Bobo. That said it's a place I would go to pick-up food or have it delivered as the seating inside is very limited. I had their General Tso's Chicken lunch special which came with more than enough delicious food for a lunchtime meal! Oh and pretty darn good prices too!"}
{"text":"Because I did so well at work and possibly because my boss sympathized with me being sick and all, she decided to treat me to lunch.  I chose this place for the reviews and affordability.  

I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken that came with fried rice.  Too bad it didn't come with soup or spring roll.  But, can't be too picky.  Kung Pao Chicken was very tasty and for the price we paid I would order it again.  The rice was also pretty good.  It just needed egg.  My boss also ordered Egg Drop Soup.  That tasted pretty good too.  However, it lacked corn.  I think I've become a fan of Egg Drop Soup with Corn.  Egg Drop Soup to me will always need corn now.  Otherwise, I won't have it unless it just comes with it."}
{"text":"The food was okay! Good prices. But it was nothing crazy good. It was definitely not a place you want to stay and dine... better to take-out."}
{"text":"Thx to yelp found this place close to my friend's house,funny she has been there many times and did not remember the name,as it is a strange name for a chinese restraurant.. The place is a small in hole in the wall,,maybe can seat about 12 max,but mainly to-go is there business ,which is ok with me,as I usually take to go most places. I got the combo lunch/dinner,,it comes with 3 single apetizers,, the crab ragoon was smooth and tasty,the butterfly shrimp,was deep fried good,but the egg rolll,was bland,but then again I am not a big fan on egg rolls..
The combo was reasonably price,which was a great selection for dinner to go.. I got the shrimp and broccoli,the shrimp were huge,not those tiny ones and lots of them.. Hmmmmmmmm sounds good, too bad I live on the other side of town, I would go there more often for cheap good lunch.."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a friend.  We were the only ones dining in.  The waitress was super helpful with the menu - pointing out where the Americanized Chinese food was (score!, back panel) and offering some of the more authentic dishes (mabu tofu).

For the both of us, we got the General chicken special ($6.99), honey walnut shrimp, and mabu tofu, with a nice pot o' rice.  It was too much food, and we could have done without the general chicken, but it was all delicious and super cheap!  The total bill was $24 and some change...for all that food? 

Would def recommend this place.  I will totally be back to try other things."}
{"text":"We'll be back. I have had two experiences at Bobo: once by myself doing takeout and just recently with my Taiwanese husband in tow and dining in. On the first round, I thought it was just ok, but I wanted to give it another go. Second time, I think having an Asian brother with me assisted in the flavor department! It's a strong call for quick, semi-Americanized Chinese eats. The menu isn't huge, but more than likely, they can make things you may not see on the menu. 

The owner is a hoot, and she took a great interest in the husband's nationality. Based on his Taiwanese roots, she made suggestions and even offered up some off menu items. I think the key is talking to her and describing your dream dish. More than likely, they can make it! Heck, she even offered to make brown rice if we called an hour ahead of time to let her know we were coming.

We had the Kung Pao and Szechuan chicken. Both were fresh and flavorful. Everything is also cheap. The all day $6.99 special comes with egg drop soup, egg roll, fried shrimp and crab rangoon, but I may just stick with the dinner orders in the future. The little extras weren't worth sacrificing the size of the entree. 

Fun fact We asked about Bobo, and we were told it is a play on the Chinese word for baby."}
{"text":"Quality food at a great price. The lunch and dinner plates are very well priced and the portion sizes are large. The food is always super fresh and tasty.  I usually have to wait when coming in to eat since it's never empty and is a small, family staffed place."}
{"text":"Great food and nice, friendly staff! I went in about 30 minutes before closing time. I wanted to eat in, but I was hesitant because restaurants can get grumpy with last minute diners, so I was going to place an order to go. But the waitress was so kind and welcoming - she insisted that I was welcome to stay and eat, so I did. My shrimp with vegetables combo was fresh, hot, and delicious. And they didn't rush me. The place seems to be run by a family - the waitress said her husband is one of the cooks. It seems that they care about their food and their customers. It was my first real meal in Las Vegas after a long day at a work conference, so I was glad to enjoy the food as well as the experience. If I lived here, I would eat here often because their prices are also a great value."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices."}
{"text":"Very good value, I wish they would deliver to my location (I am a block outside the zone) but the food is very good especially for the price, Shelly (I think she is one of the owners) is very personable, this place is very casual it is not equipped for big crowds or formal dinners but is extremely comfortable for informal dining or if you are in their delivery zone.
   Thanks Steve"}
{"text":"Fantastic food for great prices, especially the lunch specials.  The hostess could tell I am Korean and immediately brought me a pair of real Korean chopsticks!  She picked up that my boyfriend is Filipino and suggested dishes that Filipinos would like. We are definitely going back since the prices are great, the food has been hot and fresh and it's convenient to where we live and work."}
{"text":"Shelly who runs the front counter is amazing.  All the food is amazing. The best fast food Chinese in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Love this place tucked in a small shopping plaza, you walk in and there are only 5 tables but, the food is great very fresh and inexpensive. Every dish I've tried has been so yummy. It is a little comfort food gem for us we love it. And the owner has a quirky sense of humor she is funny ,once you get you know her you understand her personality. Would recommend this place hands down.  Try the orange chicken it's soo yummy."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've had takeout from here and I am still unimpressed. The cashew chicken was bland and lacked flavor. Even with the unusual addition of bell pepper in the dish it still was quite bleh. The fried rice and noodles that accompany the lunch special were underwhelming as well. The hot and sour soup I ordered tasted more like egg drop soup with a lot of pepper and pork thrown in. I have friends that love this place, but for my palate I have to disagree."}
{"text":"Just tried this little gem. It is more of a take out, but has a couple of tables to eat at. The was was very good and the service was great"}
{"text":"Tender chunks of chicken, fresh veggies, good service. The sauces were flavorful. Great takeout option or dine in if you can't wait. While we waited for our order, we were treated to a hot egg flower soup."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! And service was by far the best I've had in a long time. The owner was sweet, quick and very helpful. There are plenty of Asian restaurants near me, although this place is far from me it's well worth the drive and I can't wait to eat there again!

Food priced very low for the quality and amount you are served. $8.00 gets you a plate of food and enough leftovers for another meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! You can tell that the man and woman who own bobo really take pride in the food they serve. They even made a special chicken and mushroom dish for my one year old, and gave us a homemade hot mustard for our kung pao chicken, beef with broccoli, and chicken lo mein. The complimentary wonton crisps and egg drop soup were a really nice touch, and the prices are great too. I will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Love this place and don't mind driving a bit out of way for it. The owner is so nice! Fresh and super good prices - I'm super picky with Chinese food in Las Vegas and glad I finally found an awesome spot!"}
{"text":"Small, Family owned, good place for quick yummy Chinese. They have a great deal $7 for individual meal - entree plus rice or noodles. 
Basics are great like Beef and broccoli, chow mein, breaded chicken with garlic chicken are all really good. Would skip the king pao chicken. 
Overall a good place for take out nights!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was amazing and for Asian cuisine this is not my first rodeo. I consider myself a good judge on Asian cuisine because I am willing to explore the menu and I live and grew up in an area with a lot of great Asian restaurants. So in this city I can't compare locations because I am from Los Angeles but I do know great food when I taste it and this place put its mark on my list of go try. So I was here on vacation and I of course I search for a good lunch spot and this one came up. When we arrived it was the day after Thanksgiving so it was empty with just two customers during our meal. The lady that served us was amazing very friendly, informative, and just all around hospitable. She served us an egg soup that my wife loved but my son and I were not into because of the texture.  We started with the pot stickers that the nice lady mentioned she makes fresh daily and they do run out occasionally which is cool to know. We then had orange chicken, egg rolls, lo Mein, and Mongolian beef which were all amazing. My son definitely wants us to come back here when we are in town so I think it was a winner for us."}
{"text":"When my husband suggested a quick Chinese lunch, obviously I was down. He brought me here to this place he had been to a few times when he worked in the area. 

Let me say, there is nothing special about the inside. And as I waited for my food, I was thinking about how they should definitely re-do the place. BUT, then my egg drop soup came. Then my delicious Kung Pao Chicken with chow mein and rice arrived for 4.95 and I had no complaints left at all. 

It's a small place with maybe 4-5 tables, kind of dark and our server was the owner. She was so kind and funny and told us how her husband has been cooking for 40yrs. The prices are so reasonable, like beyond, but the food did not taste greasy or poor quality at all. It was so delicious. SO DELICIOUS. We will definitely be back. Like a lot."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas. I ordered Singapore noodles, crab rangoons & pot stickers. All was yummy. The Singapore noodles weren't excellent but okay. Good flavor but I only had 3 shrimps in it & was a little dry.
Would like to try something different next time.


So this is my 2nd time coming..& I showed up early to pick up my order, because I came from work & the lady up front is such a sweetheart. She gave me a bowl of soup while I waited and remembered that it was my second time coming in and thanked me. Super sweet. I ordered the Mongolian beef this time, I'll let you know how it is!"}
{"text":"Quality food. Great taste. The lady working the front is very helpful. Thank you for suggesting saving the grilled onions from Mongolian beef to use in my breakfast the next day :)"}
{"text":"I've been back twice since my original review and have tried 3 more dishes!!

Kung Pao Chicken - Delicious!!  Could go spicier, but very yummy.

Beef with Broccoli - Lots of beef!  Then again I prefer more vegetables than beef in my Beef with Broccoli dish.  

House Special Chicken - This tastes like a chicken breast with tempera batter and a sweet orange garlic glaze.  Daughter ate most of it.  

Next time I'll have to try the cashew chicken!

Bobo Chinese is a delicious whole in the wall with specials that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"This is hands-down my all-time favorite Chinese food restaurant in Las Vegas.  The food is always delicious.  My boyfriend and I have been several times, and although I live on the other side of town, the food is definitely worth the drive.

The restaurant itself is squeezed in a small strip center by a Smart & Final and Smiths, the dining room is tiny, only 4 tables, but the restaurant does a steady carry out business.  Shelley (the owner) and her husband (whose name I don't know) single handedly run the place.

Shelley is amazing.  She knew my boyfriend and I on our second visit (even though it was over a month since our first visit) and now we are greeted like old friends.  She knows what we like to order  (I order the same thing every time, and my boyfriend likes to experiment with the menu).  We are hardly the exception.  She greets almost everyone who calls and comes with familiarity and knows what people want before they order it.  It's astounding.

As previously mentioned, I usually order the Lemon Chicken -- it is tangy and juicy -- while my boyfriend orders random things on the menu.  Most recently, he had the twice cooked pork which was divine.  

The prices are more than reasonable -- making this some of the the best priced, and best tasting food in Las Vegas.

I think the owner is a little sweet on my boyfriend, (and I know he harbors an inappropriate crush on her), but that does not change my enthusiastic 5 star review!

Go!  Call and Pick up!  The food is delicious!  Definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"When we walked in we were seated water(and we didn't even ask). Ordered egg fu young and fried
rice,directly after we ordered hot egg drop soup was delivered ( it was very good). As soon as we
finished the soup the food arrived the rice was very
good but the egg fu young cut like butter. It was so
good (3 patties) and the gravy was great. The young lady who takes the order and greets you when you come in , makes the visit worth the trip.
She talks to you like she has been knowing you for
a long time. Great food,great price,I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and I love the waitress. So welcoming and friendly and order the house chicken! You will not regret!"}
{"text":"BoBo China is a regular spot of ours because we love the service and food experience so much which is consistently good!

I opted for the walnut shrimp this time and it did not disappoint! I also ordered a side of appetizer crab rangoon which are always a hit! 

Along with oolong tea which is so welcoming in this cold weather it was a real treat!

We are regulars and will be back many times over and over again!

Thank you bob china for giving my tummy a happy ending it always feels so damn good!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while looking for our new favorite Chinese place since we just moved here. I was not disappointed! We are in and really loved the intimate atmosphere. Even with our 3 young kids the lady who waited on us was super patient and made us feel welcome. We will be hitting this place often, that's for sure. We ordered a few combos and shared everything family style and were out the door under $20 before tip which is rare with a family of 5."}
{"text":"Excellent little place!  Absolutely amazing amazing  food, which is wonderfully presented and fresh, not to mention affordable!  This is a newer place that needs a lot more recognition!  Family run; hospitality from owner is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Stop by since it wasn't far from where I was at, try their shrimp walnut and there general chicken special. It also came with egg drop soup and one egg roll, one fried shrimp and one fried Wong ton. The bill came to 19.00."}
{"text":"Dropped by over the weekend just to check them out.  The menu is not extensive, the restaurant is small (not much room for dining in if you are coming with a large party), but they are supposedly one of the top Chinese restaurants in the country.

Anyway, I ordered one of their all day specials and it was done within a few short minutes.  The shrimp tasted fresh, everything was piping hot (yeah burnt my tongue getting a preview before I drove home). I felt that there was a lot more \"sauce\" than the rest of the food,otherwise it was tasty.

It is a nice little neighborhood Chinese take-out spot for those in the SW (Sahara and Durango).  They will deliver within 2 miles.

I think the restaurant is run by a Chinese couple.  The wife mans the front,while the husband cooks in the kitchen.  Definitely worth supporting this kind of small business that provides good food and good value.

I will give it 4 stars, with one of the stars dedicted to the stone throw proximity to my current abode."}
{"text":"Tried for first time tonight. We ordered and took it to go. Really glad we did! We are a picky bunch and we were all happy. Lady up front super nice and helpful with the menu. 

Orange chicken - amazing, highly recommend 
Cashew chicken - delish 
Fried rice - really good, like the east coast
Steamed rice - perfect
Won ton soup - yum

Egg Rolls- really spring rolls. Not our fav so we will just skip these next time. 
We were told the spicy mustard was great- but we didn't get any fried wontons to try with it :( really missed those!"}
{"text":"I should had done this review way sooner. I came in a long time ago on a rainy day but it was a very memorable experience. 
I remember I had an exam the next day and I didn't have time to cook and wash dishes so I chose to do take out. It was one of the most crazy raining day in Vegas and I was the only customer there. After she took my order she asked me to sit down and brought me a bowl of hot soup while I waited for my order. 
My order was promptly made and while I was waiting she found out that I was from Taiwan. Before I left she gave me some dried Chinese herb so I can make some hot tea because she thought it's not good for my health to drink cold Thai iced tea on a very cold day. 
Their food was fresh and hot with huge portion and very affordable price. It is too bad that I don't constantly crave Chinese take out or I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Bobo's is great! My wife Loves the soup! Shelly the owner is awesome. The lunch and dinner specials can't go wrong if your looking for a deal. Over all the food is good and the service is also very good.This is always one of my go to places!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! 

I gave Bobo a chance last year after reading loads of reviews and I was not disappointing. 

My husband and I love the food and we absolutely adore the owners. 

I have been slowly converting my friends here and they too have not been disappointed. The food is amazing, the prices are fabulous and the atmosphere is great! 

The only reason why I am giving 4 stars is because they are so bloody far away from me! But honestly, they are worth the drive. 

Everything is made fresh, the veggies are still crunchy and the ambiance is great. 

I highly highly recommend Bobo to everyone in search of good chinese food."}
{"text":"Food 5 Star, Service 5 Star, Atmosphere 3 Star. This place serves incredible tasting chinese food and is a complete bargain.  Husband does the cooking and the wife runs the front end.  Her service is always great and she you by what you order.  I have now eaten there many times and have yet to have a bad meal.  Favorites are the Kung Pao Shrimp, Mongolian Beef and the Beef with Broccoli.  I still haven't gotten around to eating the Orange Chicken, Shrimp in Lobster or the Egg Foo Young which others eating there have told me mare their favorites. Know this place only has a few tables and you don't go there for any sort of atmosphere.  They do a lot of takeout biz.  However I am still giving this place a 5 because I have yet to find a place in town with better tasting Chinese food."}
