{"text":"I tried the SOmethin's Smoking Caf√© today. I was expecting more of a \"plated\" style of service. You go to the counter to order, and they serve the food on plastic baskets. The chicken sandwich was on a nice roll, I got the sauce on the side, which was tasty. The lettuce was old and not fresh and the tomato had seen better days too. The salad was okay as was the mac and cheese. But would have been much better served all on one plate instead of little tiny cups. The ambiance leaves little to be desired. It was tables and chairs and very cold and sterile. I was hoping more for a comfy cozy place to sit. I have had better chicken sandwiches at fast food. But I did like the different smoke flavor. My suggestion would be to have a larger size chicken breast that fits the bun, fresher lettuce and tomato. Freshly made food is always best."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood!  In todays world there are restaurants everywhere around this place.  Good BBQ is a wonderful thing.  The different regional preference may be part of this review.  That being said, it is new and has a about twenty small tables and a great wall of windows to view the outside world. Inside the restaurant, there is the smell of wood fire smoke.  This is a good start, sadly it may peak here.

The menu has the usual suspects wings, chickie, ribs, and beef brisket.  Everything here falls in the $8.49-19.99 range.  The entrees come with two side and you have a choice of seven different sauces.  So my experience was beef brisket.  It was fished out of a \"warm broth bath\" (yeah, this will be a problem) and placed on to a nice Kaiser roll.  There is some sauce/dressing here (but I can't taste it).  I get my sauce (bourbon bbq), and its really thin stuff.  Step 2 mix it together!  The bun soaks out all water from the beef, the sauce drips out, and the bun crumbles!  Now, if this was a great tasting, beef sliced to taste sized meat and the sauce stayed around for the first bite, well I might have had something to write about.  It didn't!!  So with drink and $11 spent to get here.  I'm not really impressed.  Again, they just opened, so it could get better and they were dead at the time (1:15pm).


There were 2 sides, I still held out hope. What can you do to smoked mac & cheese? Well add flavor!  The cheeses may have had three different ones, but one strong flavor would have worked.  That did nothing for me.  But what a second, they have something really good here.  Smoked bake beans are really, really good.  Almost enough to add a half star to the review.  The price makes that impossible, unfortunately.  If you can find an Old Carolina BBQ, you will be much happier!"}
{"text":"I was interested in one of the new places of lakewood eateries so i took a shot at Something Smoking Cafe... Sorry bad choice :(    Ordered 1/2 chicken price was fine but that's where it stops... The chicken by itself was ok but as soon as i added the mustard barbecue it was like adding watered...very sour tasting.. I really enjoy mac and cheese  so i ordered  it as a side dish. BLAND BLAND BLAND no taste at all i think i took about 5 bites  waiting to find some taste but it never showed up so needless to say that wa the end of that i just put it aside and left it there..Than I also noticed ( homemade) cornbread  Sure glad i did not live in that family  it was horrible.;no taste again...So needless to say look for something soon and new to take over the store front.., I just dont see this place lasting very long at all ."}
