{"text":"I was served cold corn beef hash ,no 1 in my group was overly impressed . 1 visit was enough ."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Best part on a Sunday morning no one in the place was playing/talking on their phone. Everyone just enjoying the food & the company. BTW this review was written in the car!"}
{"text":"I visited on a Sunday around noon in late January. The place was packed.  The service staff was clipping!  The wait to be seated was about 15 minutes.  I ordered Eggs Benedict, Hash Browns, OJ and one slice of bread.  Total cost without out tip was $16.97.  $3.00 tip brought breakfast at a diner for one person to $19.97.  Waaaaaaaay too much to pay.  Killer was that the fresh squeezed oranges for the small glass of juice was $3.95.  Almost $4.00 for a glass of OJ.    Cute place.  Convenient parking.  Tasty but not outrageously good food.  Very loud.   Not worth a $20 breakfast.    Certainly worth a visit, but make sure you come prepared for a hefty price for your meal."}
{"text":"Classic diner fare, quick service, easy accommodation for a member of our party who has a wheelchair. And I loved all the PGH classics like fried mush and French toast made with Mancini's bread."}
{"text":"I have no idea why everybody does not give this diner five stars. Excellent home cooking and generous portions with very reasonable price. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars, but alas, that's not allowed.  It's just a diner, so it's not anything fancy.  But if you're craving diner food and you're in the area, I'd say this place is a solid choice for some breakfast food.    I'm always craving pancakes, so that's how we ended up at this place.  We're not usually up in that area, so we turned to yelp and found this place.  From the outside, the place definitely doesn't look like anything special, or even a diner really since it's located in a shopping center.  Once inside, it's your basic diner decor with lots of booths and that feeling that every surface has a thin film of grease.  But hey, it's a diner, what do you expect.  Pancakes were good, as was the other breakfast foods we ordered.    The main complaint I have is that the coffee WAS SO WATERY.  I mentioned it to the waitress who said that they had noticed that this last batch of coffee wasn't right and that she'd bring me a new cup.  Second cup came and it was still watery..."}
{"text":"Kelly O's has quickly become our family favorite for breakfast!  The food is always awesome!  It is served hot and fresh off the grill. The French Toast is my favorite. It's made with Mancini's bread and sprinkled with butter and cinnamon sugar. My husband loves their turkey pot pie soup. Also if you have a chance to try the Banana Bread French Toast- you must!!!!!!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. If I could put 0 stars I would, by default it gets a 1  I went here the other day after being told for a few years now how great the food was. I sat at the diner and this blonde woman who reminded me of Jim Carrey in \"The Grinch\" both in attitude and in physical appearance came over and asked me if I'm ready to order in a demanding voice. She never said welcome to Kelly O's or good morning, no greeting or anything. I hadn't even been there for 2 minutes and didn't even have a menu which I told her, so she asked if I needed more time. I asked for a water and told her to give me a few minutes. About five minutes later she comes back again with the same attitude asking if I'm ready yet. I told her no I've never been here and I'm still looking, give me a few more minutes.   After a few more minutes the grinch came back once again asking if I'm ready yet as if she has somewhere to be and I'm wasting her time. I ordered my food and before I could finish ordering she turned around and began entering my order into the computer. After noticing a fresh squeezed orange juice machine in front of me, I said excuse me before you finish on the computer can I get an orange juice. She was standing less than 2 feet away and apparently acted as if she didn't hear me. So when she finally finished and turned around I asked again for an orange juice.   Now at this point I had been in this diner for about 15-20 minutes before ordering my food. So after asking her for the orange juice she became even more disgruntled, nodded her head, huffed and puffed, and proceeded to get my orange juice. I watched her put her finger on the button to start squeezing fresh OJ but then looked down into a styrofoam cup under neath the spout and saw there was orange juice already squeezed in the cup. I had been in there 20 minutes and nobody had touched that machine until now, so who knows how long that orange juice had been sitting there, if it was someone's leftovers, or if bugs had been flying around in it, or something dropped in it. So she decides to take the warm leftover crap from the styrofoam cup and dump it into a cup for me. How lucky of me to pay for leftover garbage. I told her I watched what she did and I didn't want it. I wanted fresh orange juice not leftover crap that had been sitting there. She dumped it out, nodded her head and told me that's how we do it here, it is fresh and mumbled asshole. I was in shock, I have never had such terrible service anywhere. I watched this grinch of a woman walk to the back kitchen and point me out to 2 other staff members and call me an asshole.   Other than that the food wasn't that great. The bacon was burnt and black, the sausage was hard and greasy, the eggs were greasy, but the pancakes were some of the best I had.   Despite my treatment and against my better judgement I still managed to be the better person and give that miserable bitch a good tip. But I will never go back to dine there again. I may just call ahead to order pancakes to go but I would never recommend this place to anyone for dine in service"}
{"text":"In recent months, I wrote about a comparison between The Dor-Stop and Pamela's, two popular breakfast diners here in the Pittsburgh region.  I have been hearing good things about Kelly O's in Pittsburgh's Strip District and invited my aunt for a Sunday gab session.    We were off to a good start at 9:30 and had a seat as soon as we arrived.  Promptly, a coffee was served and within 5 minutes our order was placed.  Then... it got super busy and people were seated all around us.  That is good, right?  Well, they also received their food before us even when our order was BEFORE theirs.  This went on for 25 minutes.  My aunt and I had a lot of catching up to do, so we were enjoying the outing.  However, we were getting hungry and this needed to be addressed.  The server immediately checked and mentioned that our order was submitted but somehow half of it disappeared off the handwritten slip.  The waitress was nice, but the excuse did not seem to make sense.  Regardless, our orders were placed again \"on the fly\" and we received them within 5 minutes of the complaint.    Now, the actual food.  I had a steak and cheese omelette which was good, served with potatoes (onions and peppers added for an extra cost).  It was extremely good and not overly greasy like some diner food can be at times.    In closing, it was a shame that the order fell through the cracks because the saving moment was that the quality of the food spoke for itself.  As we departed the extremely cute stand-alone building, there was a line out the door.  In my mind I thought, these folks will get a quality breakfast and everyone makes a few mistakes.  I will give this place a chance again, especially since they have a lunch menu that looked delicious."}
{"text":"Awful. I ordered the breakfast burrito, and after waiting (for way to long), when it came, it came with steak inside which i did not order (as a vegetarian) and which they also charge your two extra dollars for.  They waitress nicely replaced my meal (to-go, since everyone I was with had already finished eating) and also gave me a $5 gift card.  When we were paying however, we were \"sassed\" by another waitress who would not let us pay with a debit card because of their $10 minimum policy.  After explaining to them, that our meal would have been well over $10 had they not messed it up, our paying with a debit card would not be a problem.  She finally went ahead and charged the card and when she returned it, proceeded to rudely lecture us about how they only just opened and that's why the service was slow, and that thy wouldn't make these kinds of allowances for us again in the future.   Long wait time, received an incorrect order, and received bad customer service."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh just for the weekend and came here this morning for breakfast. Mostly leaving this review for the breakfast fan and French toast connoisseur/-euse, so I'll say I definitely approve of the classic diner atmosphere. Cleaner than the typical classic diner, though, daffodils on the table, and friendly, quick service. French toast was better than I expected since Italian bread isn't optimal for French toast, but I was surprised. Three slices, not flimsy, but probaby could have soaked a little longer. Overall, though, good, and served with plenty of syrup. Silver seal of approval. Have faith, too, that you will find ths place when navigating here. You think you're in a quasi-dilapidated industrial park, but Kelly O's is certainly there and shines a light."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat. It's a small diner. Nothing fancy. But the waitress was nice and the food was good. The portions were pretty large as well. They have fresh squeezed orange juice which is really good, but it's like $4 for a small glass. However, I would say it's worth giving a try if you like OJ!   Overall, not a bad place to stop if you're looking for something pretty casual."}
{"text":"This is a great little place for breakfast. Friendly waitstaff! Awesome quick fast with an old-school diner feel. Give a shout out to Cassie one of the best server at Kelly O's diner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw this restaurant featured on Diners Drive Inns and Dives on Food Network. We were excited to visit the place as the dishes prepared on TV looked great.  Well, let's just say that \"art\" did not imitate life in this situation.  My wife ordered \"Gregory Scott's Favorite (biscuit & sausage gravy with eggs, home fries). I ordered the Haluski and the turkey pot pie soup.  My wife's biscuit and sausage gravy and my turkey pot pie soup came from the kitchen cold. We got a new order of the biscuit and sausage gravy which was VERY watery and I canceled my soup order.  The eggs and home fries were acceptable (how hard can it be to mess that up) and the Huluski was pretty bland.  Overall, we were quite unimpressed."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal there even when they are crazy busy, they are playing off the Triple D thing a lil to much. Best egg white omelet!"}
{"text":"Home fries were good, and the eggs were done perfectly. There was no line as I arrived just about 1:30pm. But the waitress was quick on the draw with the coffee and refills. Restroom was clean and convenient, unlike Deluca's...will probably stop here again"}
{"text":"THIS is the spot for breakfast in The Strip. The servers are always awesome and the food is amazing. My girlfriend and I have been here at least 20 times now, sometimes even two days in a row. I can vouch for their omelettes, pancakes, and waffles. I've never had a thing here I didn't like! There is something for everyone on their menu because many items can be customized. Can't say enough good things about this place. Now that you've read the review, time to get yourself to Kelly O's!"}
{"text":"I went to the diner on an early Saturday afternoon, so I was expecting it to be busy. After I sat down, a couple who had come in after me was approached first for their order, which kind of upset me, but I let it go until I realized after 10 minutes that no one was coming, so I had to get up and ask the waitress for a drink. After I got my drink, it took another 10 minutes to come back and take the order. My order was a chicken salad sandwich. Nothing too crazy. It took 40 minutes to come out of the kitchen. Along with my food came a new waiter who wasn't the friendliest person or the most attentive. By the end of the meal, I had to get up to ask for my check because it took so long, abd it ended up being the wrong bill. Overall, the food is nothing to preach about, and the service was below average."}
{"text":"The best pumpkin pancakes I have ever had!! Sausage was equally as good!! Service was great too...will definitely recommend and be back to strip location!"}
{"text":"Had the omelet special it was different. Had pirogies and kielbasa. Unexpected but pretty good. Service was attentive and made it a point to interact with customers. The reason for thee star? Coffee tasted burnt and I was put off by a pile of rags and garbage that could be seen on the kitchen floor by the fridge and fryer."}
{"text":"The food was a okay, typical diner food. My issue was our waitress. It was Labor Day and Kelly Os was one of the few places open, I understand they're busy and trying to turn over tables. However, that is literally no excuse for her condescending demeanor toward us. Furthermore when we were literally still putting food in our mouths she asked at least three times if we wanted boxes and were ready to go. I will much rather wait in the line at DeLuca's for an hour than have that customer experience again."}
{"text":"I have been here several times... just in the past 4 months. ok I frequent the place and I consider myself a diner connoisseur of sorts!   One of the best Pittsburgh Diners in the city.  Pumpkin Roll Pancakes were the specialty this week!"}
{"text":"The idea of what Kelly O's could have been was wonderful. A real \"Mom & Pop\" diner, two minutes from my house serving up tasty recipes. My wife and I envisioned making it part of our weekend routine. Well, what Kelly O's is in reality is a real disappointment. Bland, boring and way overpriced.  Trust me, you'll find better quality, more variety and originality at one of the chains, of which there are quite a few in close proximity.  Kelly O's is not worth the effort."}
{"text":"Love how everything is homemade! I personally know the owners and they strive for amazing customer service as well as excellently prepared foods. Have never been disappointed when sending someone from outside of state to the diner! Amazing potato pancakes and I love the Seana!"}
{"text":"Tried the Kelly O's in the Strip District for a Saturday Lunch. Small and noisy as well as quite busy. Had a few minute wait which wasn't bad given how busy they were.   I decided a sample of a number of things was in order. The World Famous Breakfast was good but not \"world famous\". I tried the Turkey Pot Pie soup -- awesome. The Mush with crumbled bacon, the way Guy from Triple D's likes it was good. Finally I had the Pittsburgher - 1/3 lb burger, pierogi, Polish Sausage, and cheese. Quite good but the Polish Sausage was 2 very small pieces.   The diner is quite noisy so you may need some quiet time to decompress."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here Sunday morning for a late breakfast around 11:45 AM. Amazingly, the wait was only about 15 minutes. (FYI they will not see you until your entire party is present in the building, which is a good policy because it prevents people from holding a table while others are waiting in line.) The menu is large, the servers friendly. We placed our order quickly because we had already \"studied\" the menu online. That's when the problem began. We waited 42 minutes for our breakfast to come out. After about 30 minutes I need to just stand up and move around because I was sore from sitting, and I noticed no one around us had any food either. That seemed very odd for a breakfast diner. I had tried to get the waitress's attention because I thought perhaps there was a problem in the kitchen that we needed to know about so we could leave. Everyone kept smiling and was pretty evasive and finally at 40 minutes I said something. I was told that all the tables had been seated at the same time so the kitchen was backed up. That would've made sense except it's breakfast and nobody's food had come out in sometime. ( even if there was a big rush on the kitchen they should be able to send out some breakfast dishes).  She said ours would soon be up though so we waited. Then a lot of people's food started coming out. I got my Yinzers sandwich, which was fine other than the bagel was not toasted or grilled or anything, just a plain ol' egg bagel cut in half, although it was fresh. The home fries were actually undercooked and I couldn't eat some of them because of that raw potato texture and taste. That was ironic given how long I waited for breakfast. I don't know if our experience was unusual or not. No other yelpers seem to mention the length of time they waited. I for one expected a quick diner breakfast and on with our day. My husband said it was the best sausage gravy he's ever had, and the biscuit was also good. We were both just frustrated over the wait and we're having a hard time enjoying the meal."}
{"text":"how can anyone rate this place less than 5 stars?? Kelly O's takes breakfast to the extreme! Anything you try is so delicious!"}
{"text":"NEVER EVER EAT HERE.  I was having lunch with my children and a girl came in trying to talk to the owner Kelly.  The owner started screaming at her, swearing.  I had my two children with me and I will NEVER bring them to this place again.  Please keep your children out of this restaurant. She is an angry unappreciative woman.  DO not give her your money"}
{"text":"Perfect diner food great staff hot food only reason i didn't give 5 star because the wait was long but the food was hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out because it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. What a disappointment. The food was no more special than any run of the mill diner. In fact I might say it was worse than the average diner. I ordered eggs with corned beef hash and the corned beef hash was almost certainly canned. It came out cold and the eggs were overdone. The coffee was watery. It was really shocking to me that this place was featured on the show."}
{"text":"A coworker and I ventured over to the new diner for lunch today. Instead of the standard lunch time fare, we both chose to go with breakfast for lunch, and we were both glad with our decision. The outrageous breakfast sandwich is just that, outrageously good. The toasted Mancini's bread with a fluffy egg, cheese and your choice of meat hit the spot. I went with bacon, and was rewarded with a delightful marriage of bacon, egg and cheese. I also got a side of shredded potatoes as they are called on the menu, and requested they be covered in cheese. Overall a great lunch. Will certainly be back for more delicious affairs of food."}
{"text":"You have to swing by this place. Food  looks  great and service is beyond friendly and cool. Shout out to \"Danielle and Corey\"!  I had the pancakes and the Power Play omelette.  Outstanding!"}
{"text":"such a cute little old fashion place. absolutely love the old fashion diner decor, and they have just about the best french fries and chicken strips around. I live about 15 minutes away, but whenever we go out for breakfast for Mother's Day or a special holiday or just anything - it's always here. so cute and good. a little on the over priced side though, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Diner Perfection.  Short order classics served in a joyful chaos. Ballerina waitstaff choreograph a masterful dance."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little spot, very close to downtown & has parking...which in Pittsburgh is a plus!! The sausage gravy & biscuits are the best I've ever had. Great service too!"}
{"text":"This place was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. That's the best thing you can say about it.  Had breakfast here; hash and eggs. Eggs ok, hash out of a can and served cool. Coffee,  which should be superb in this locale is below average.  Heck, the Waffle House is better than this.  Eat here if it's the only place open."}
{"text":"My  husband and I recently went here for breakfast and absolutely loved it. The service was excellent and we both thought the food was great. He got an omelet and I got the OMG breakfast and we enjoyed all of it! Since it was our first time, the waitress recommended trying the French Toast and it was delicious but huge! Cinnamon-y and it also had a crispness to the edges of the toast - yum! I also decided to try the sausage but keep in mind if you like hot sausage, that it comes in one large patty and the sweet sausage comes as two smaller patties. Both types were very good. Since our first visit, we have been back two more times and both times were great experiences all the way around. We brought our 7-year old with us for breakfast and the server was very attentive and friendly especially to our daughter. I was surprised to see so many low reviews on here for Kelly O's but our family really enjoy the place and wish it was open longer hours. This is now our go-to place for breakfast rather than settling for Eat n Park or Original Pancake House."}
{"text":"Came here at lunchtime on a Sunday with DH, my brother, sister-in-law, and 6-year-old nephew. We were seated right away, and they kept the coffee coming--most appreciated.   Among us, we had the Pittsburgh Benedict, the haluski, onion rings, the Reese's PB Cup pancakes, an omelet, and corned beef hash and eggs. Everything was cooked to order and very tasty. And where has haluski been all my life? Total comfort food, Polish-style. Onions, cabbage, noodles, bacon, butter, and cheese--just everything a body needs. Perfect.  The only minus is that the service was a bit slow. Otherwise, it was a wonderful Pittsburgh diner experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Agree with other reviews...average.  Been here twice. Service was great. Fun Pittsburgh local vibe. Food was meh. On the first trip the Breakfast skillet was ok. A bit greasy, but not too bad. I tried it again for a lunch as was disappointed. Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed and gravy was not so good. Mashed seemed to be instant. Turkey was somewhat cold as well. My daughter got a burger that was average.  Overall they pimp the DDD hype. Huge posters of Guy F in the place and Tee Shirts being sold. Also the menu has cheesy things like \"Try this the way Guy likes it\". Also the restroom is in the kitchen so you have to walk behind the counter into the back to use it. Very odd."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food. I love bacon really really well done and they're not afraid to run it through the fryer to make it perfect! The hot chocolate is awesome too!"}
{"text":"This place has suffered since they opened up the strip location  long waits for food. 1 server running hard the others walking around with a thumb up their a $$.  Realllllly slow kitchen. Food is good but if you have a time table, skip it."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great staff and a short wait. Limited parking though, but they do have a parking lot of their own, which is great in the strip dist."}
{"text":"Normally, I would say the best thing about Kelly O's is the delicious food. But the staff is what keeps me going back as often as I do. They work their butts off to keep this high-volume machine running! Kelly O's also offers an appropriately regular rotation of specials alongside the classics. The pecan pancakes won't let you down, and the kielbasa is divine!"}
{"text":"I will give the owner 5 crazy stars. After waiting for our meal for an extraordinary long time I was served bad inedible food. I sent the food away and thought that would be the end of it. A very nice young man came to apologize and removed the meal from our bill. A short time later after I paid for the remaining meals the owner appeared. She accused me of lying about the bad meal and stared telling me I was talking dirty. It was one of the best performances I have seen in ages. She was yelling all of this at me making a scene. I just wanted to be left alone.  I've never seen anything like it. Truly disappointed as their food is usually excellent.  I kinda want to go back and see the crazy train once more. It was gloriously crazy.  So crazy in fact that next time I'm bringing friends to the Kelly O crazy show."}
{"text":"I love Kelly O's! It's absolutely amazing! Nothing bad to say about it, just the day I went there was a huge wait and a line that started to go out the door and the area to wait is very small. The food is so worth it though! I've only had their breakfast, but they have other food such as salads, burgers, etc as well. They squeeze fresh orange juice and it's $5 a cup but it is incredible and so fresh! It's so cool this is in Pittsburgh and was featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. Everyone needs to eat here atleast one, but you won't be able to stop at that! :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a basic diner, then Kelly O's is fine.  But that's it -- there's nothing special about the place.  The food is ok, the coffee mediocre, they have good days and bad days in terms of what is coming out of the kitchen.   Many folks/visitors to town may go there because of the \"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives\" connection, but there are many, many better places to go if you want good food.   Go there if you have to, but it's not a destination."}
{"text":"It is a diner so don't expect linen table clothes and candlelight.  However, you can expect very good food and warm, friendly service.  The haluski is a must.  As are the cinnamon rolls.  Korey is a sweetheart who makes everyone feel welcome.  You should go at LEAST once."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast burrito, it was awesome! Service was a tad bit slow. Coffee had a burnt taste to it."}
{"text":"We went here after seeing an episode on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. I tried the turkey pot pie soup and found the soup incredibly rich and delicious. The haluski was very tasty. The corn mush/ polenta was not tasty and was kind of bland. The meatloaf was goodt and the hot turkey sandwich was tasty as well. This place was located inside of a strip mall and parking was accessible."}
{"text":"If it wasn't surrounded by better options, I would probably rate their breakfast fare better than passable. The truth is that there are 4 other breakfast options within walking distance that this pales in comparison to."}
{"text":"Great service, great food for the price. Good place to come in the heart of the strip district."}
{"text":"When visiting from Cinti, we found this by accident after parking and what a find!!! Amazing food, quick service and friendly workers. Danielle rocked!!! Menu has a large variety, something for everyone.  Eggs Benedict called. Hubby had Power Play omelet. huge!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of meeting your executive chef he was very nice! I will have to stop in and try some of your food."}
{"text":"This little local diner was super good. Had their breakfast burrito and sweet tea and they both hit the spot. It's well known in the Pitt area but wasn't too busy when I stopped in mid morning. Will be back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Kelly O's in the North Hills and in the Strip.  As far as diners go, they have great breakfasts.  I usually tend to get the Mixed Grill for breakfast, most often with the addition of ham (you can add a choice of meat to the mixed grill for an upcharge).  I usually don't get cheese on top, but this past Saturday, January 18, I did.  My only complaint was that all the cheese wasn't melted.  Still, the Mixed Grill was satisfying and generally done very well.  My frequent breakfasting partner got his usual, the Outrageous Breakfast sandwich.  This sandwich is very large, and comes on (the best!) Mancini toast.  He always raves about it, and this is someone who is a bit of a foodie.  Overall a great breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"Kelly is just fine in my book. It is all of 1000 ft from my front door in the strip and I've stopped in a few times for an early breakfast during the week ( before 7 AM...) they are usually busy, and have only one hostess/waitress working from what I understand  before 8 AM. This can be a bit of a drag if you're in a bit of a hurry.  As for their food, I've only had the protein breakfast which is a few nice scrambled eggs and either sweet or hot sausage made fresh on site. The sausages are very good. This spot is A-OK!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday morning. I had the eggs and corned beef hash, rye toast, home fries, and got a grilled cinnamon roll. Sounds like a lot of food and it was. I only ate half and as of right now 5:00 PM. I'm still not hungry. It was all delicious and our waitress was really good.   This cinnamon roll thing is right up there with Pamela's pancakes.  Bathroom was clean. I would definitely go there again. Nice alternative to DeLuco's or Pamela's."}
{"text":"Short and sweet....This Diner is great! My dad got breakfast, kielbasa looked amazing. I got the Chef salad with homemade ranch. First time. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch today! I had the crab and asparagus omelette, so delicious.. Especially with the sauce they put on here. They have some unique menu items which are awesome for someone like me who likes to try new things! I would visit here again in a heartbeat:)"}
{"text":"Visited Jan 1st at 12:30 pm and place was packed. Seat yourself and drink order was taken within 3 minutes, but then drinks were slow to arrive due to hand-off to another server. I got coffee and orange juice and ordered the small 1 egg meal with sausage, shredded potatoes with onion and pepper. I thought the menu said 75 cents for them, but it's 75 cents EACH. As others have reported, the shredded potatoes even with onions and peppers didn't have very much seasoning, so I'll be trying the home fries next time. Coffee was mediocre at best and orange juice was very fresh, of course, because it's squeezed on site in a large machine, but it was very light and not like what I'm accustomed to.  Husband got the hot turkey sandwich with fries and they asked if he wanted gravy on both the sandwich and the fries and it was delicious like that. When the gravy on top cooled, the gravy underneath the sandwich was still piping hot. He gobbled the entire thing right down and said he'd definitely order that dish again.  I got 1 single french toast and it was very good but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again. We then shared the Zucchini fries with ranch on the side (another 50 cents extra) and they were also delicious!! We definitely recommend the hot turkey sandwich and the zucchini fries.  While I'd say the food was mixed with some of the dishes were downright delicious and some were pretty mediocre, I think it's just a matter of finding the right dishes for you and your tastes. Once you've got it down, I think this place could definitely become a regular stop.   Service was slow and kind of sloppy throughout, but they had other duties like filling all sugar, salt, etc on tables so I give them a bit of a break. I would recommend Kelly O's if you're not worried about time.  Decor/House: 3.5 Service: 2.5 Food: 4.0"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts places in Pittsburgh. Service is great and very friendly. They have the fluffiest omelettes! and Italian toast!!! We went on a Thursday and there was no wait. However on a recent Saturday there was somewhat of a wait but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Crab and asparagus omelette, best sausage omelette in the strip. Each meal under $10. Hard working wait staff and kitchen keep food flowing and little waiting for tables. Will be back. Often."}
{"text":"This breakfast spot will make you want to come back day after day. Your heart and gut may not agree - but who cares! The breakfast bagel with hot sausge patty is my go to. I love the price, the atmosphere and the food even more. It's not fancy, but it really doesn't have to be."}
{"text":"Good food and everyone I spoke to was pleasant. Fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I have seen the diner in the strip district for a few years now, but have never stopped in. I'm so glad I finally got the chance. The service was slow to start, but eventually the staff came and were quite friendly. The menu is full of various options with endless combinations for each item. I had the original breakfast sandwich with fried egg, bacon, and cheese on a biscuit. Now I consider myself to be a biscuit connoisseur, and I was not disappointed here. If I could recommend a side, it would definitely be the home fries with peppers and onions (if you order that as a full side, be prepared to share). Overall it was a great experience, and I would suggest going here if you have time."}
{"text":"Saw this place on triple d so I thought I'd check it out.  Contrary to what most reviews say, the service was actually decent.  Not the fastest, but not the slowest either.  That actually doesn't factor into my 3 star rating (I would give it 3.5 if i could.)  The food was good, but nothing special.  The eggs and kielbasa were what they were.  As for the mush...that stuff was no bueno.  I like polenta, but I didn't like that.  I got it Guy's way with the bacon, didn't help.  Overall, it's a nice diner with a laid back atmosphere.  Good service, but mediocre food.  And unless you are a diehard polenta eater, stay away from the mush."}
{"text":"I bet it gets better, but first round, they've put a great amount of focus on the dinner decor and not enough on the food.  I got the BLT.  Two slices of bacon?  That's is?!  And I wanted to try some of the items from Diner's Drive in's and Dives, but also it had a special section on the menu, which made it less special!  I will go back and try some other things, but I'd say, avoid any non \"specials,\" they're just weak."}
{"text":"I came here for a late breakfast and ordered the Chicken and Bacon club sandwich with fries. I didn't mind waiting slightly longer than average for the food to arrive, but the service was quite slow.   When the food arrived, it was alright but certainly nothing special. Flavors were bland, and my orange juice was watery. After we had finished, the bill never actually came, nor did our waitress. After waiting for quite a long time, we had to ask.  Perhaps worst of all, the meal itself was way (way) overpriced for what we ordered."}
{"text":"I stop at this diner every time I come to town and it never disappoints!  Breakfast and lunch are fantastic.  They have creative specials and I've always had good service.  My breakfast faves are the Mancini French toast and breakfast burrito.  My wife had the BLT and loved it.  Can't wait to try the turkey pot pie soup.  Thanks Kelley!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. For having been featured on the Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\" Kelly O's wasn't anything to rave about. Maybe I had high expectations or I didn't order the right things. I ordered the Pittsburgh Benedict and the hubby ordered the hot turkey sandwich. My Pittsburgh Benedict was decent, creative version of your traditional eggs benedict. Instead of Canadian bacon or ham, it had kielbasa along with a pierogi and sautéed onions. I enjoyed it but the hot turkey sandwich was a disgrace. It should be a diner staple so I'm not sure how Kelly O's managed to mess it up. The turkey was so dry; you might as well have called it a turkey jerky sandwich. We asked for cranberry sauce because the sandwich was drier than the Sahara, but of course they didn't have any. When someone can make a better turkey sandwich at home using oscar mayer, a microwave, and some wonder bread, it's time to 86 that sammy for good. Moral of the story, if you're hungry and in the area, there's a Shop'N'Save right next door."}
{"text":"This is a good Pittsburgh diner.  I've only ever visited for breakfast and really don't have any complaints.   It's good, but not spectacular."}
{"text":"Really good coffee and food. Maybe a little expensive but quality products and service makes up for that. Tv famous but still authentic and worth it."}
{"text":"They sure do  love to advertise that they were on Diners Drivein's and Dives. It was written everywhere inside. The waitress was ok, not too friendly but she got our stuff without a big wait. I was really excited that they have Bratwurst for breakfast and you MUST get the Turkey Pot Pie, no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"OMG! I'm so sad at how many low reviews Kelly-o's has! :(  I visited here back in June 2009 so it was quite a long time ago but I can remember the service being great. Their coffee being one of the best coffees I've had in a long time. And the food being great too! We decided to visit after they were featured on TV and we definitely don't regret going! It was great!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast joint, I love the corned beef hash. Last time service was a little slow, hence the missing star. But definitely a go to spot in Pittsburgh for early AM food."}
{"text":"Kelly's actually catered a wedding I was at tonight and the food was fantastic! There was carrot ginger soup, mushroom risotto balls and create your own pasta. I had linguini, sausage, spinach, mushrooms and red onion with alfredo sauce. To Die For!!! Seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten. Really want to go to the diner to check out the full menu. I give the catering an A ++++"}
{"text":"My husband and I are newer to the Pittsburgh area, so we heard the usual hype about Pamelas and Delucas in the Strip as breakfast options. Today we decided to try something new and hit up Kelly O's! I am sooo glad we did.  First off, there were 4 parties and 14 people in front of us when we arrived. Used to the 45+ minute waits at Pamelas and Delucas, we were unsure whether or not we should stay, but we got through so fast. It wasn't more than 15 minutes before we were seated. We came at 9:15 am on a Saturday so I feel like it was probably a pretty busy time.  Once we got seated, our hostess quickly got our drinks. (Coffee is good, and definitely try their house-made OJ!!) Our waitress was nice and got everything correct. Drinks were refilled quickly without us having to ask, and everyone was so nice.   I had the strawberry and cream french toast (yummy!) and the home fries (delicious, crispy on the outside, flavored well). My hubby had a build your own omelette (he says it was great, and it was huge!). The food was good and affordable. Bigger portions than the other diners in the Strip.  If you're in the Strip, go to Kelly O's. The service, food, and wait times are all better than other hot spots in the Strip like Pamelas and Delucas."}
{"text":"I'm guessing people from Pittsburgh are super picky about their diners.  Being from the South, you don't generally find a whole lot of places like these that aren't massive chain stores. So when I'm in different parts of the country, I make it a point to stop into almost every place that Guy Fieri visits. Out of the 40-odd places I've visited, I've not raved about one. This place will not make two.   I arrived after the big breakfast rush, but before the lunch crowd arrived. The place wasn't packed, all three of the waitresses were super helpful, my coffee stayed hot and fresh, and they made certain that I knew what I was doing when I ordered. I ordered the Gregory's Favorite, and the biscuits and white sausage gravy were almost as good as my grandmother's. The eggs were perfectly scrambled, the hash was covered in peppers and onion, and I barely got the word \"hot\" out of my mouth before the waitress flashed three bottles of hot sauce at me and let me pick one. I took photos and mailed them back to my Army buddies, and the string of curse words hurled my direction made the food nearly perfect. Nothing like jealousy to make a visit perfect.   Long story short, if you avoid the super-packed times, this place is worth the word of mouth spread about it. The food is plentiful, the staff was excellent, and I look forward to dragging the boys in sometime and listen to them validate my thoughts - that this place was GOOD!!"}
{"text":"They were experiencing an issue with a water main break and me, my cousin, and father really wanted Kelly O's.. well the waitress was so nice. Let us in the door regardless of the issue and made for a very joyful experience. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Yummy.  Our go to place for breakfast in Pittsburgh.  I have been here many times and none of them have disappointed me.  We've been to the one in the North Hills, too.  It's just as good.  We mostly stick to the omelettes because they are huge and very tasty. Darnell's Chicken omelette is one of my favorites.  I tried some of the lunch items that were on the DDD show years ago.  The best one was the pot pie soup.  The haluski with bacon had a little bit of a weird taste.  Anyway, I would simply stick to the breakfast items on this menu, that is their specialty and they do them very well.  Another nitpick, they don't have anyone managing the line when you are waiting for a table.  So everyone has to try and figure out who came first and who is next.  It would be great if they just had a pad of paper for people to sign in so there were no discrepancies.   Oh and they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived. Luckily they are NOT cash only like Pamela's."}
{"text":"On our way to Wigle Whiskey we noticed Kelly O's, which has a parking lot in the Strip and decided to stop for brunch.  We where seated right away, which I didn't except because of the time of day. I ordered a steak & eggs (my usual). It was very good, I still prefer Bob's Diner's steak and eggs over all others though.  My daughter had a protein disk and was not impressed. My wife order a stand breakfast and like it a lot, she really like the toast which was fresh bread.  I will stop again if I am in the strip, but I wouldn't travel to the strip just for Kelly's. I still have to look up the episode of Diners, Drivein's and Dives that Kelly O's was on. I usually watch the show all the time."}
{"text":"Wow what a busy breakfast place. We were at the Smallman St. location. A bit off the beaten path, but still packed. We did get there before a wave of more patrons. We were seated quickly. And served right away. Coffee was good and the breakfast was really good. 4 out of 5 for service and same for the food. Wish I tried something a bit different than the steak omelette, mine was a bit watery inside. But not complaining I ate it all. Just saying there are way better choices on the big breakfast menu. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the famous Kelly O's, as seen on Tv, as you can see in big sign on the building.  I've been eating breakfast here for the last few mornings this week, and I have to say, the food is pretty decent, it is American diner food, as good as you'll find anywhere in America, maybe even a step or two away from a Sysco truck. Their open early, at 5:00 am, which is nice when you're working early, or if you were still up at that time, ha!  I will say the place is pretty pricey for what the food is, but, it has been on Tv."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner food and service. When for breakfast and was extremely impressed, their eggs benedict was as good as any more upscale restaurant's. The fresh orange juice was amazing! Great place to take the family, something for everyone on the menu. Will definitely be back when my parents are in town."}
{"text":"The food hete was pretty standaard for breakfast. I ordered a $9.99 meal that consisted of bacon, eggs and pancakes. The pancakes were medium sized and the eggs over medium were perfect. My only complaint was the slightly burnt bacon. It made me regret my meal choice entirely. I tried some of the home fries from my friends and they were amazing. I kinda wish i went with the sausage  biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order.   20 minutes later drinks still didn't come.   We got up and left and the waitress had no idea why we were upset.   The place wasn't even that busy.    Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I had the crab eggs benedict and it's amazing! Also I like that you can get a side of fruit instead on the standard hash browns. The fruit had a good variety- strawberries, bananas, pineapple, grapes and melon. It was really fresh and yummy! Service is also fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here after looking it up on Diners, Drive In's and Dives. All I can say is, it was a horrible experience!! The waitress was not pleasant at all. I was going to walk out but it was 2pm(they close at 3 so maybe they were irritated that we were there) so where were we going to go. We asked about certain items on the menu and you would've thought we asked to skin a cat. She was not nice!! Seemed like we bothered her when we asked. Then I saw that the cook wasn't wearing gloves!! OMG again almost walked out. The food wasn't anything special. Would not go back ever again!! Well it does certainly make the DIVE rating!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here the regular run of the mill diner with no real wow factor to it would go back but only if the lines an DeLuca's and Pamela's are to long to wait."}
{"text":"First visit to this great little diner today......the crab Benedict was laden with huge chunks of tasty crabmeat and accompanied by great hashed potatoes. Every item ordered at the table was perfect! The server was prompt and helpful and the place has that roadside diner ambiance although it's in the heart of the city. I'll be back in a few days, for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and had breakfast each time. I really enjoyed it. The staff is friendly ish. The eggs Benedict was delicious. Not a poached egg tho which was odd. It was fried, and still delicious. I liked the shredded potatoes. Perfect for a hangover. Yummy fried cinnamon roll. The establishment is clean and I can't say that for all the breakfast joints in the strip! Will definitely be going back soon hopefully!"}
{"text":"Weekly breakfast/brunch here is an absolute must. Best breakfast in the burgh. I would stick to the specials and breakfast, have had lunch items a few times and not that great, def a must stop if you are passing through and regular place if you live here."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome highly recommend the OMG. Loved the hit sausage!  Friendly old time atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place wished they had longer hours. Very quaint almost \"Mel's Diner\" type of vibe waitress not like Flo but very friendly and fast service. Parking is very very limited. Kelly O's is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Wow, three star only.  Must be some extra picky breakfast diners.  Anyways, I normally get the breakfast original but I noticed the California omelette this morning.  Three eggs, scallions, avacado, pepper jack cheese and fresh pico with potatoes and dry wheat toast.  Great breakfast with multiple coffee refills equals a five star in my book..."}
{"text":"Ok so where do we start. Hands down best coffee you will find at any diner, if it's even fair to call this place a diner. We had the Benedict and the Pittsburgh omelet and I can't wait to come back and enjoy it again. So as we were enjoying this amazing food and incredible coffee we were graced with the presence of Kelly O. She came over to see our bubba (see photo). She spent some time with us telling us her story and enjoying our little guy. As I was raving about the coffee she explained it's for sale up front which made my day. Then to our surprise she had a bag delivered to our table. Such a sweet, caring, giving heart which I imagine explains the success of Kelly Os. Will be back and will tell everyone about this place."}
{"text":"2 stars for food, 4 stars for everything else. I think the good, fast service is what keeps the ratings up for this place. The exterior and interior of the place is also very cool. The murals and shiny walls definitely stand out, even in the Strip, and the inside looks like a very traditional American diner. Also there's pictures of Guy Fieri all over the place which is funny. That's about it for the nice stuff.  Let me start by saying that I am an extreme eggs benedict lover, and order eggs benedict around half of the time I go out for breakfast or brunch. I was so excited to go here after reading all the reviews recommending the dish. The menu even says they're \"Outstanding\"! Imagine my disappointment when I saw that the eggs weren't even poached, and my further disappointment when I cut open my egg and it wasn't runny at all. SAD. At least the potatoes on the side were fine?  A lot of people do seem to have had a good experience though, so maybe I just ran into an off dish. And maybe I shouldn't have expected so much out of an eggs benedict at a diner."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here. Just as good each time. Great service, great prices. Thanks Kelly Os staff!"}
{"text":"This is my 5th or 6th time back here.   Still trying to find out what the big deal is...the waitress didn't smile once, the bacon wasn't crisp like ordered, the sausage patty was dried out and hard.  I would have complained, but it took so long to get our food, it wasn't worth another wait. Then I went to the ladies room, no toilet paper and it was colder in there than it was outside.  Oh, the French Toast was good."}
{"text":"Love this place but y'all have to do better asked for cheese eggs and I get 2 slices of cheese not even melted on some eggs come on now guys..."}
{"text":"Every time, I mean every time, Kelly O's hits the spot.  I must say I am an early bird and hit the breakfast joints before 8 on the weekend.  I wasn't really, really hungry, but they have a lil one breakfast that is one egg, one meat, some potatoes and Mancini toast.  Just enough.  I added a pancake for a taste of sweet.  For the heartier eater, there are daily specials and a variety of large bfast plates.    The key to Kelly O's is that the service is always prompt and icing on the cake is mancini toast."}
{"text":"I was always curious about this restaurant because I passed it many times while visiting the Strip District. I finally stopped and couldn't be happier I did. This is my new favorite breakfast spot.  I love the fresh squeezed OJ and the biscuits with gravy.  It can get very busy on the weekends with lines out the door.  But I like that they have a parking lot.  Even though they are very busy the servers are always very nice.  I never feel rushed to eat my meal even though there is a long line of people waiting.  Overall I feel this is a good spot to eat at. The price is right, the service and food are good. I haven't tried lunch yet but I'm sure it's delicious."}
{"text":"Not a lot of places in Pittsburgh open early for breakfast before the sunrise, but Kelly O's Diner actually does open at 5am sharp!! My husband and I were looking for a place to stop by for breakfast after dropping our relatives off at the airport for their early morning flight out of PIT and we saw there was just not that many places to pick from that would be open early in the morning hours. We literally waited in our car 15 min before 5am in front of Kelly O's parking lot,not so sure if it would actually be open at 5am, but we're surprised and happy that it did...and on time, too!  The waitress was nice and friendly and not as crabby as we would have thought, given that it was 5am. Our meal was also large and they definitely did not skimp on the serving size.  I saw a few regulars came in as early as before 6am and the waitress recognized and greeted a few by names, too. Overall, a great place for breakfast with its own (and free!) parking lot. It also doesn't hurt that the diner was once featured in Guy Fieri's Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, too!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and last. I have spent the whole weekend with food poisoning! I KNOW it was this place as my husband and I ate everything the same that day except he didn't eat at the diner. Not sure what was happening in that kitchen but I def.  won't eat here again.  Staff was rude as well.When asked the waitress what they are known for/what she suggested she stated \"we are known for nothing. What do you want?\"  Pittsburgh is a big enough food scene that I def. won't miss this diner .Not sure why I would care that they were on DDD. That doesn't mean they are good(or clean)."}
{"text":"I probably would come back because I really liked the pot pie soup; however, I think everything is overpriced for what you're getting.  It was good, but it wasn't $50 for a family of four to eat good.  I could have gotten similar flavors at Eat n Park for half the price.  Price aside, I would have given four stars if it wasn't for the service.  We did go around church rush time but man, our waitress was in a rotten mood it seemed.  It took 5-10 minutes after seating to get our table cleaned off.  Drink and food were even slower.  This is understandable.  I don't fault servers when I'm there during busy times.  (Unless I see servers standing around doing nothing while my table needs cleared.)  The thing that really bothered me was the waitress correcting my six-year-old about something she was doing.  My daughter was squeezing lemon into her milk because that's what kids do... they experiment.  I tell my kids if you want to do it, that's fine... but you will eat/drink whatever it is you just did.  She was going to drink it until the waitress told her \"don't do that, you'll make your milk curdle\".    Sure, science dictates that milk will curdle with lemon (and usually with greater quantities I think... 2 tbl lemon juice to 1 cup of milk I think to make sour milk for baking?).... but it happens at much slower with cold milk.  If the milk was hot, hell yeah it would have been a problem within five minutes.  Um, seriously?  So then I had a six-year-old meltdown on my hands and glass of milk I paid for she won't drink.... that she would have otherwise.  And guess what, it didn't curdle the entire hour we were sitting there waiting through slow service.  Note to servers:  Unless the children are being raised by douchey parents who are letting them climb up your walls and are obnoxious to other guests, let them do what they're doing.  And if you're going to correct them doing something rather harmless, you better be prepared to comp me the drink you just ruined with unneeded comments."}
{"text":"We love Kelly O's! We have only been to the one in the strip district. We have heard about the original but have yet to make it.   There breakfast is very hearty. The portions are large enough that you do not walk away hungry. You may even take some home with you.  The Italian bread/toast is great. I am speculating that it is the same bread Primantis uses for their famous sandwiches.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Average, not terrible nothing to great either.  Last time I was there I had the hot roast beef.  Can't recall it being anything to spectacular.  I also had the Burger, again, nothing to write home about.  Cute inside, definitely screams diner.  Our waitress had a little attitude but maybe that is the atmosphere they were going for, like Flow at Mel's Diner.  Kiss My Grits!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today with friends from work. The staff was very nice and remembered a few of the crew I was with. Nice touch. I went with the meatloaf sandwich and fries covered with gravy. The gravy might have needed some more spunk to it but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, service was above reproach and prices are good.  WOW...what a great place to eat!  Ask for Shaemus!"}
{"text":"Kelly O's is one of those cute-looking diners that I probably wouldn't try unless I was socializing with someone outside of my usual circle. I've found that unfortunately most old-school Pittsburgh diners don't cater to people with food allergies very well, so I just end up feeling horrible afterwards. My mother wanted to come here after I finished running in the half marathon however, and since she'd offered to treat both my boyfriend and myself to breakfast I agreed. We arrived and were given a table immediately, since the strip had just begun to reopen and the place wasn't yet packed. Had we been twenty minutes later I think we would have waited an hour.  We were given waters and menus within five minutes by our brusque but efficient waitress and immediately began looking at the options. I settled on hash browns and bacon, since those usually don't come into contact with milk or vast amounts of butter. Our waitress soon came back bringing the coffee we'd ordered initially and took our food orders. This was where we ran into problems. I can understand that many native Pittsburghers have a more simple attitude towards food (getting my mom's boyfriend from Brentwood to grasp the severity of her symptoms after eating wheat was like pulling teeth!) however I didn't really like how my mother was treated like a nuisance for not wanting toast included with her meal due to her celiac disease. My mom is one of the sweetest, most courteous people I know and she didn't even ask for a substitute, she simply didn't want the bread touching her food. Finally the waitress huffed and puffed and agreed to give it to my boyfriend who was sitting across the table instead. Crisis averted! After that I didn't dare ask that my food be made dairy-free and just sat there hoping for the best.   Our meals came quickly and were hot when they arrived. Everything was good for standard diner fare, and the bacon was above average in my opinion. It was done but still chewy, which is a hard balance to strike. The people at Kelly O's definitely know how to prepare what they're serving properly. I did have a stomach ache later, however I shouldn't have been so reluctant to trouble our waitress. In light of the old-style (read treating the customer like they're bothersome) Pittsburgh service here I don't think I'll be back myself, however I'd gladly recommend Kelly O's Diner to anyone without food allergies."}
{"text":"Kelly O's is a Strip District spot that has been on my short list of places to try for quite some time. It's located just a stones throw from the hustling center of the Strip and does have a few free parking spots (arrive early to take advantage). For those not fortunate enough to snag a space there is a $5 flat rate lot right next door.  When you enter there is a sign directing you to wait to be seated. You can wait, or try your luck at the counter. You don't need to check in with a host/hostess, just keep your place in line and wait. The waiting area is small, so be prepared to wait outside. The menu is traditional diner fare with a few popular items that stand out. The featured dishes on Triple D are haluski, turkey pot pie soup and mush with bacon. I can't vouch for these choices, but hope to be able to after a return trip. I had the Mancini's French toast (local bread company - amazing), shredded potatoes with onions and peppers and a side of bacon. I also had fresh squeezed orange juice. The French toast was tops, the potatoes were nothing special (no real flavor and the onions and peppers weren't cooked with them very long, just tasted like they were thrown in at the last minute). The bacon was good and the OJ was magical, I just wish it came in a bigger glass and didn't cost over $3.00.  My husband had an omelette and the shredded potatoes, he didn't have any complaints.  As far as a breakfast place in the Strip goes, I prefer Pamela's and DeLuca's over Kelly O's. No signature choices really stood out to me. However, I'm looking forward to returning for some Haluski and turkey pot pie soup and hoping to add another star or two to my review."}
{"text":"For my visit, I'd like to mention all the good things first then I will explain why I am not giving this restaurant a 5 star.   First thing that impressed me was their orange juice-fresh squeezed. But very expensive, $3.98 for a very small cup. Second, everything we ordered tasted very good, I have nothing to complain about the taste. We got pancake, cornbeef, country fried steak.   HOWEVER, the reason I am giving this place a 3 star and probably will not go back is because I found a hair in my gravy. That is a big turn off for me!!!!! And it clearly wasn't mine since I have dark long hair and it was short blond hair. So I stopped eating right way and took me a while to get that out off my head."}
{"text":"First time here. Saturday around noon. Only waited five minutes (Pamela's was 30 min wait). Was constantly full though with steady in n out patrons. Excellent service, plenty to choose from on menu, prices reasonable. Breakfast was very good - eggs, sausage, bacon n pancakes - all cooked perfect and tasty. Wife enjoyed the chicken salad. Can't ask for a better experience."}
{"text":"If you're a tea drinker, like me, you'll be delighted when they start you with two teams bags and extra hot water whenever you order hot tea. No more envying coffee drinkers & their endless refills. The food is wonderful; I recommend the sausage gravy, and their omelettes are great.   Very good fresh-squeezed orange juice too!"}
{"text":"I love Kelly O's! I've been here at least a half dozen times and will continue to come back due to their consistently awesome food and great service.   I've had their chicken salad (which is HUGE and delish), their Haluski (a Pittsburgh favorite and one of the items featured on diners, drive ins and drives- sooo good! If you ask, you can order it in a half portion which is what I like to do! A half portion is still a ton) and this past weekend I ordered shawna's breakfast. This breakfast platter was your choice of either one pancake or French toast, eggs, bacon, and then a choice of either extra bacon, sausage links, sweet sausage or hot sausage. I ordered egg whites, French toast and sweet sausage with bacon strips too! All of that was under $8 and was super delicious!   My boyfriend always gets the western omelette and loves it. Their home fries are house made (not frozen) and are awesome. They also serve Mancini's toast (a local favorite)!   Kelly O's is the perfect place to go for breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday morning before a walk through the strip! I've never had to wait in any lines when arriving, which is a nice alternative to Deluca's (which is always packed). Friendly and fast service each time I went as well!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pumpkin pancakes, which were massive and fluffy. I don't know what service is like at the tables, but sitting at the counter everything came out rapidly. Our coffee cups were always brimming, our food flew out of the kitchen, and everything was delicious. If you dig diner food, and aren't intimidated by lady servers with neck tattoos, put this place in your date book. Killer homefries!"}
{"text":"I ended up here with my party of 6 for Sunday brunch after the other two places we stopped at along the way had more than an hour wait. No thanks. When we came into Kelly O's, although the tiny restaurant was crowded, there was no wait. Once I heard they were on DDD, I knew this would be good enough for me.  Our waitress was pretty curt, but got the job done. She kept coffee filled, answered any questions we had about the menu, and cleared plates quickly.  I can never eat a lot for breakfast, so I tend to order a couple of little things, and then pick off everyone else's plate. I ordered an English muffin and turkey bacon, and picked at the waffle my fiance ordered, and the Fresh toast my mom ordered. Everything was delicious! Prices were super affordable, too.  By the time we left (around 11 a.m. or so), the place was packed, and there was a decent wait.  I would definitely go back if in Pittsburgh again!"}
{"text":"We've never had a bad experience at Kelly's other than the breakfast was TOO HUGE. Man, do they give you a lot of food! I recommend the haluski and the turkey pot pie soup. The breakfast is served with Mancini's bread toast, a mountain of fresh home fries and perfectly cooked eggs. Fresh-squeezed OJ  to wash it all down, and I'm GTG until dinner! We've always had great service. It's a hole-in-the-wall but worth finding."}
{"text":"I gotta say that this place exceeded my expectations. I expected a little greasy spoon joint and it was better than that. We went here because Marty's market wasn't yet open at 830am on a Sunday. We were seated immediately and our food came probably 5 minutes after we ordered.  I had the eggs Benedict and my wife had a Belgian waffle. My meal was great but I do have one complaint: there wasn't enough! The shredded potatoes were very good too. OJ was fresh squeezed. We were in and out of this place in 35 minutes but didn't feel rushed in the least. The server was good too: nice, kept the coffees full, checked periodically. This is a very well run restaurant."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from our concierge at our hotel.  Upon arrival we had to wait approx. 15-20 min but it was worth it.  Place isn't very big but the line goes quick.  Staff was very very friendly and the order was perfect.  Food is in huge portions which I didn't know and as you can see by the pic I posted it was a lot of food.  I ended up wasting about half which was a bummer.  Food quality was good and tasted just as good.  Come here with an appetite."}
{"text":"If your close to the strip district and want a good breakfast I would suggest to stop here... It's always packed so that means one good thing foods awesome..."}
{"text":"Delicious food.... waitress was patient and friendly.  She took our orders perfectly! Definitely go back when we are back in Steel city"}
{"text":"At best a three star and only because my breakfast sandwich was actually delicious and not greasy at all. The eggs were light and fluffy and the bread they use is just so good. Although they could cut back on the butter slightly.  The negatives? Well there are MANY!!! First the place looks like a dump, the tables were dirty, the waitstaff simply put, looked unclean. Our \"waitress\" was rude and acted as though we were an inconvenience to her, this is her job mind you.  We ordered two identical egg sandwiches (again delicious, props for having dynamite food), two glasses of water and a coffee. Now the most disgusting thing was not that she pulled the creamer off the dirty table behind me and served it to me, or that it was warm when she did, but in fact it had CURDLED and had huge chucks in it. Needless to say, I very nicely asked for a new one. Without even apologizing she grabbed it off the table and brought me another one, ALSO CURDLED AND CHUNKY...I decided to drink my horrid coffee, black at this point ,and when I drew the waitresses attention just to let her know the stock might be bad, she got in my face and proceeded to \"explain\" to me, that this is what it looks like, as she just poured it from the fridge. Then when I expressed my apologies for not knowing that \"this is how coffee creamer is\", yeah right lady...I was just grossed out by her horrible dentition and breath, and wanted her to back out of my face...then I asked for some whole milk, hoping that wasn't also curdled. She threw the milk on the table in a 2oz plastic container, like you would use for sauces...she never came back to refill my coffee, or check on us.  Even I can make an egg sandwich delicious, so I would skip this place and the curdled milk and rude waitress it comes with.  Pittsburgh, you can do better!"}
{"text":"Everything is bigger in Pittsburgh.  Got the steak and eggs w/ potatoes and manchini toast. Very good especially with hot sauce.  Aub got chocolate pancakes which she enjoyed.  Corey had the open face roast beef which came covered in gravy and Emma got the breakfast burrito, which is the largest burrito I've ever seen.  We all enjoyed it, service was quick. The bathroom is in the kitchen which is kinda different."}
{"text":"Ive tried Pamela's and Delucas. This one is the best although I liked all three. Very close competition. Very friend staff. Great food. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"So I read the iffy reviews and we decided to go anyways. I am a fan of diners, and did not have high expectations. So caveats aside, I enjoyed my breakfast. We both ordered the eggs, potato, meat deal and also shared an order of the blueberry pancakes. The shredded potatoes were delish -- I've missed what I call these - Hashbrowns! The pancakes were huge and the blueberries obviously fresh. The service was fast, friendly and efficient.  It seems to me that the issues the diner was having before have been sorted out. I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is the diner you've been looking for! The food here is absolutely fantastic! The owner makes these recipes like you're mum makes at home, which makes this place feel even more comfortable.  We frequent this place often (at least twice a month).  We've tried almost everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed. I'm a personal fan of their chicken salad sandwich.  It's large pieces of chicken with just the right amount of mayo and celery, served on two slices of Mancini's bread.  Absolutely delicious.  And their onion rings are huge and crispy.  The breakfast options are vast and they always have interesting specials on the large board in the back of the restaurant.   I can't say enough good things about the servers. They all work extremely hard and do a fantastic job of keeping your cup full and your food coming.  If you are there more than 2 or 3 times, they are probably going to remember you.  It's a small joint, but the kitchen staff gets the food out quickly and it's always tasty.  If you're in the Strip, Kelly O's is a fantastic option for breakfast or lunch.  I just wish they'd open up in the evenings.  For Strip residents, like us, we would love a quick, neighborhood diner to pop into on the weeknights."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my family and the service, food, and prices are all worth 5 stars. Everyone who works here and dines here is SO friendly. My family was decked out in Chicago apparel when we came and the waitress (who grew up there) and my mom bonded right away.  Their menu is super extensive, with many breakfast and lunch options so I was overwhelmed. I ended up getting Seana's breakfast with bacon, eggs over easy, and french toast. The portion was huge and the french toast was the highlight of the meal because it was made on the famous Mancini bread...probably some of the best bread I've ever had. Next time I come I will probably just get french toast because the bread is THAT good. Everyone loved their meal and most entrees are huge and well priced (under 10$- such a steal because I am used to manhattan prices!) This place was featured on the food network too, for good reason."}
{"text":"Good... service I thought was fitting. Quick and good conversation. My expeditions were higher and I will receive some backlash from this comment but I think most Pittsburgh local eateries are bland. Waiting for one to steal my heart"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!! I love their vegetarian eggs Benedict & pumpkin pancakes. The food is fresh & very good at Kelly O's. Service & prices are good and food comes out fast even though they are very busy. Free parking in their parking lot which is a huge plus for going down to the Strip District. Definitely recommend eating here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference!  We have had a standing brunch date at Kelly O's twice a week for the past 6 years. Last week there were all new faces (except Amanda) and NONE of them were smiling.  We gave it a try 4 times, never did get our order right. If we don't want to stand in line for Amanda's section (which is what everyone was doing) we will be going elsewhere. We really missed our favorite entertainment, watching \"superman\" run tables!!!!  Our food is always cold now and you have to sell a kidney to get a refill of coffee. Too bad Kelly O, you suck now!!!"}
{"text":"Nice people, quick service, good food. Exactly what a diner should be like... Had the omelet and biscuits and gravy - excellent."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place for the first time today. I had a taste for french toast and I think it had to be some of the best I've ever tasted!! I could get it every time and never get tired of it. The turkey sausage I didn't care for at all, I left it on the plate. Scrambled eggs were pretty good too. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Bound!  Part XII  (For Part XI, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/lKom12WnYEjH5FFemK3M1Q/review/k97SGRvnhBMrHzqofs1WNg?fsid=UxXDThIqZWoW2rLLTPYxIg)  Everywhere I've Yelped about Pittsburgh thus far have been places I've been to before many times over, so I thought that on my last day in town, I would try some new places that I've never been to before but have always said that I should try.  First stop, Kelly O's.  The diner, buried in a nondescript strip mall about 20 minutes north of the city was featured on Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives back in 2009, but by the looks of it, you'd think they film full episodes there three times a year.  From the moment you enter the building, you are slapped in the face with the fact that a 5-year old, 7 minute video exists in time and space.  Signs around the bar, \"As seen on...\" coffee mugs, \"Daily Triple-D specials\", a menu item that reads \"the way Guy F likes it\", and so on.  I understand hanging on to the glory, but it's a lot like that douche that shows up at your 20-year high school reunion still wearing his letterman jacket and reminiscing about the only game he ever scored in.  When I watch Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives, I typically see owners and chefs who pride themselves in their hands-on, scratch-made creations with some \"dives\" actually growing their own herbs, and curing their own bacon; taking sincere pride in providing a quality meal.  I have to assume that if they had made the cut for Food Network, they must be doing something right.  I was a little disappointed.  The service was good, and the coffee was fantastic, but it pretty much ended there.  My friend and I each received our meals, and it was clearly obvious that her omelet was made with powdered eggs, and the mushrooms pouring out of it were right out of a can.  I'm not a professional chef by any means, but my friend is, and we both agreed that there is almost nothing in the world easier to cook than mushrooms.    I ordered steak and eggs and ended up with an under-seasoned steak (which was actually cooked well), and shredded potatoes which were fairly uncooked below the crusty surface.  The saving grace of the meal was the Mancini bread which, for those that don't know, is a primo Italian bread made locally.  Before I left, I ran to the restroom, which is adjacent to the kitchen.  I'm always fearful of diner kitchens that are hidden out of site, but theirs was clean and the staff was busting ass with a full griddle of eggs, pancakes and meats.    For me, Kelly O's was a nice, local diner, but there was nothing that really stood out to me as overly special.  I guess the Triple D thing got me in the door in the first place, so marketing it must be doing something right, but seriously, lighten up on it a little.  (PS:  I watched the clip of the show when I got home, and they made Haluski, a Polish staple, and I'm pretty sure any novice cook could replicate it to a tee making me even more confused as to how this place entered Guy Fieri's gravity.)  (For Part XIII, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/19XaxYSjNnI4DUdy8QshbQ/review/JAA6rarcLLWRZdI0qNgchg?fsid=AWdQiVvWP2nN-7yEGMulRQ)"}
{"text":"Man, I love this place!  Great food - I always get one of the gigantic omelets. It's easy to tell that they use good, fresh ingredients and put a lot of love into making the food. Also, get a few glasses of the freshly squeezed orange - they make it right in front of you.  For me the best part is the dining experience. I love to sit at the counter and interact with the wonderful waitstaff. There are always jokes being cracked and it can really lift your spirit.  One more thing I want to mention is that I love the fact that this place does not have any of the pretentious hipster BS that is creeping into almost every restaurant in the city. You know what I am saying - restaurants putting on a pretentious front and serving mediocre fare, while charging very handsomely.  Awesome place, I really love it!"}
{"text":"We split the special omlette for the day: pirogi, kielbasa, jack cheese, hash browns with onions and peppers and rue toast.  I don't know how anyone could eat all that food and still function.  Fabulous. Delicious. Yummy. Filling. Ridiculous. The cost for the omlette and 2 waters was $15. We left almost a 35% tip because we were that happy with the experience.  So good."}
{"text":"We reluctantly ended up here since Pamela's wait was at least 45 minutes to an hour for our group of 6. Since we were all empty belly and had a kayak trip to look forward to - we decided to wait at Kelly's since there were only 2 folks before us waiting to be seated. The place was packed but luckily the only large table became available after waiting for about 10 min. or so.  Despite the place being packed and busy - we were promptly served with coffee and our orders placed within few minutes. We all had something different from the Veggie Burrito, World Famous Breakfast, Steak and Eggs with biscuits/gravy. Pretty much all the breakfast had an option for either the potato fries or the shredded potatoes. The potatoes were good but I like the Pamela's more. Overall, the service was good - food was good and the service was much better than expected.  Overall, a good alternate to Pamela's if you're in the strip."}
{"text":"I pained over not giving my favorite breakfast joint 5 stars.  However, I don't like the omelets or the breakfast burrito. That's the only reason for 4 stars.  On the HUGE plus side, everything else here is great.  Yes, the decor is wacky and dated, but the food is spot-on.  Get the french toast on Mancini's bread, and you won't be disappointed.  Or, get the grilled sticky bun; your arteries may hate you, but your mouth will be in heaven.  My personal favorite, though, is just their eggs/sausage patty/hash brown breakfast.  The sausage is a hand-made patty, so you can't go wrong with it."}
{"text":"I went to the Kelly O's in the North Hills years ago and was so NOT impressed.  I tried Pamela's a month or two ago, and I was again so NOT impressed.  I gave up all hope on finding diner breakfast in Pittsburgh.  However, one morning I was meeting friends for breakfast, and we were looking for somewhere near work.  I figured why not give the original Kelly O's a chance?  I played it safe and ordered the Don's Free Ride Omelette ($6.99) with Ham, Cheese, Tomato, and green peppers.  It also came with toast so I ordered rye.  I am not a potato eater and this was one of the only options without potatoes.  The omelette was packed full, and the price was super fair.  Our food came out quickly and service was fast but on the go friendly.  This is as close as you seem to get to diner style in Pittsburgh.  Credit card minimum of $10 and there is a small parking lot where you can park for free!"}
{"text":"Just because this place was on Triple D, doesn't excuse the fact that the service is usually pretty poor, the food is over priced and the quality is average.  My fiance and I came for breakfast on 10/2/2011, and we waited for 5 minutes for someone to wait on us. Another 10 to get our order taken, and when our food finally came, we had no silverware to eat with. Other 5 minutes to get that, and finally we could eat.  Don't think this isn't the norm, it is. I told my fiance that this is the last time we come here. I'm over it. As for price, two coffee's, a veggie omelet, and breakfast tacos $20. Overpriced, underwhelmed, and poor service, don't mix. Save yourself a trip and skip Kelly O's."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best, I fricking love it here. The servers are friendly, the portions are large, and the food is outrageously good.    I think everything on the menu that I have tried has been delicious. The only complaint I have is that they aren't open later; I would come here for dinner if they were open.  The service really is excellent I have been here about 10 times and I can't think of a bad thing to say about them. You Rock Kelly O's!"}
{"text":"Great place, quick service and has that greasy homemade taste and portions! Come get full with plenty. One of the best spots in terms of clean, parking and bang for the $$$. I love dives like this because the food competes - their home-fries are delicious."}
{"text":"This star rating could have been a lot higher if our waitress would have been just a little kind to us during our meal. We arrived 10 minutes before they opened and decided to wait. We saw a lot of good photos on Yelp and the food did not disappoint us in the least bit. Our area was tight, but clean. Every seat filled up within 20 minutes and there was an instant 20-30 minute wait for those arriving later. I would definitely come back just for the food... Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great clean place that moves quickly but professionally. I was very pleased with the quality and quantity of food and the quirkyness of this Pittsburgh diner. Kelly O's is a great place to eat when in The Strip District."}
{"text":"This is a great little \"greasy spoon\" diner in the Strip District. With a parking lot! I've been here at least 10 times over the last few years and I've always had great meals! Despite being very busy during the typical brunch rush (as all diners are), they do a really great job of moving things quickly--from seating to ordering to serving your order. There is a counter where you can always grab a spot if there is an opening. I've been here with groups of up to 6 people. We had to wait a little longer than if it were only 2-4 people, but they were still able to accommodate. Service has always been great too!  I always have to order a glass of the fresh squeezed orange juice. They have a machine behind the counter that makes/dispenses the juice. As far as food, they have a wide variety of breakfast and lunch foods, although I always go for the breakfast. They have some of my favorite breakfast dishes, including Country Fried Steak and a variety of Eggs Benedict.  You will never leave hungry because the portions are huge! I usually have enough potatoes to take home and use for my breakfast the following morning.   If you typically default to DeLuca's or Pamela's, I would definitely suggest giving Kelly O's a try!"}
{"text":"Good sturdy breakfast with a friendly staff. The pumpkin pancakes are very good. I usually get the mixed grill with kielbasa and American cheese, and it's certainly a full plate.   The raisin toast is also very good, and they have grits!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast for the first time this morning and loved it! I'm pretty sure there is usually a wait but when I went my group was luckily seated immediately. The waitresses were attentive, friendly, and outgoing. I had the Italian French Toast, which was just regular french toast on a brioche type of bread with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top. It wasn't the most life changing french toast I've ever had but definitely was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try the pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"Best Diner in Pittsburgh! I love the early mornings and the food is just as you want your diner food! I love that you can get a smaller portion of eggs and toast, obviously to make room for the cinnamon bun pancakes. The vibe is great and the staff has been fabulous each time I've been. A definite must see if you are an early riser!"}
{"text":"Typical diner with a good breakfast that is reasonably priced but nothing that really wowed me.   First off, despite reading reviews I was confused about the line to get in.  Unlike Deluca's, there wasn't a clear cut line out front but that's how you were supposed to be seated (first come, first serve assuming your whole party was present).  There were people milling around outside the front door, and then people crammed in the small entryway in no sensible order.  I couldn't tell if we were cutting ahead of people or what.  Once we were through the line and seated, we ordered your standard breakfast.  Two over medium eggs, wheat toast, potatoes and turkey bacon for me and biscuits and gravy for my fiancé with over easy eggs.   Both our eggs came out too well done to be over easy or medium and his shredded potatoes had zero seasoning and flavor.  He didn't even eat most of them, which is a rarity.  My home fries, on the other hand, were well seasoned and crisp (very tasty).  All in all, met our breakfast craving and was a lot of food for a good price but, for me, there are other diners in town that serve better food for the same price."}
{"text":"It was the best breakfast I ever had.  Spent a weekend in Pitt and wanted a big breakfast to help with a baby hangover.  We stayed a walking distance from the strip and wanted to originally dine at DeLuca's.  The line for that place was out the door and down the street.  What seemed like a disaster of a walk ended up being a blessing.  We found Kello O's further down the strip.  It was packed for Sunday breakfast.  We waited maybe 20 minutes for a table.  I got a chocolate milk to drink.  It was the best chocolate milk I ever had.  It tasted like a cold melted Wendy's frosty.  Amazing.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  I think it was called Greg's Favorite?  Well its my favorite now.  The biscuits had a perfect crispy outside and soft fluffy inside.  I can't describe how flavorful the gravy was.  I wanted to lick my plate clean.    It also came with eggs which were cooked perfect to my liking.  I don't like moist eggs and they somehow read my mind and cooked them dry.    The shredded potatoes were a perfect complement to them.  Crispy and also flavorful.  And I have no idea how true this is but a lady outside stopped us trying to leave and said 25% of proceeds went to Ronald McDonald House.  Best breakfast ever and some of my bill went to charity?  I wish I lived in the Burgh."}
{"text":"This weekend my friends and I came from West Virginia to visit and decided on this restaurant for brunch today and it was absolutely the worst experience I've ever had. Food was average but service was horrendous. Only two waitresses were fairly nice and the rest were absolutely hateful. So rude, and disrespectful to all customers. I've never been in a customer service place where I or others were treated so poorly. One of the waitresses yelled at a customer saying \"excuse me! this is f***ing hot.\" Also the restaurant was very small and hard to park and move around. Definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"Breakfast on a Sunday before the Steelers game. About  twenty minute wait, you just line up outside the door.  Very friendly and quick service as they are turning over the tables as fast as they can. Just a traditional breakfast with normal prices.  Breakfast sandwich was good, not great, eggs, potatoes and bacon were good as well.  I would say slightly above average due to the really good wait staff"}
{"text":"cool yinzer diner! My friend Brandi and i stopped in on saturday. we were on the hunt for st patricks day shirts in the strip and she let me decide on where to have brunch since im a yelper n'at. I had a few places in mind, but I remember walking by Kelly O's during the burgh bash and ive wanted to try it since then.  We arrived around 130 but still decided on breakfast. We informed our server it was our first time here, and she gave great suggestions. They have specials daily. A few from Saturday were: pierogi and cheese omelet, philly steak omelet, oreo pancakes.. I decided on the breakfast burrito. It's huge and inside you'll find eggs, home fries, onions, peppers and cheese. You can add a side of sour cream for 50 cents or meat for $1.50-$2. i went with sweet sausage. I also ordered a side of shredded potatoes with green peppers and onions because i love eating them as a side :) My friend Brandi ordered the french toast which is topped with cinnamon sugar. She ordered the home fries and said that they were very well seasoned.    We sat near where the cooks let out the food. everything looked great! Waffles, huge salads, omelets. We are super excited to head back!"}
{"text":"My friend and i stopped in yesterday. We're obsessed with Kelly Os in the strip. We met up at Ross Park Mall to carpool to renaissance fair  and decided to stop here for breakfast on the way to fair.  I ordered my usual-- breakfast burrito with shredded potatoes. It's so tasty i just dont even want to try anything else, lol. My friend ordered an omelet and we split their \"famous cinnamon roll\"  We may just stick to the strip for our Kelly O's experience. When ordering drinks, we asked for coffee and water. No water but honestly no big deal. It also took a veryyyyyyy long time for our food. My friend just came back from a 2 week trip to Paris. We talked about the entire trip before our food came out, lol. Also, we both asked for onions and peppers in our potatoes and neither of us had any.   I can let the food wait time slide. I went to the restroom which is surprisingly in the kitchen. The kitchen is pretty small and only a few cooks. There seemed to be more tables than the strip district one so i can understand the wait time. The food was tasty so in a sense that's what matters. But if it looks busy and you're pressed for time, this may not be the best option.   We are still obsessed with Kelly O's... but the strip district location."}
{"text":"Don't go within an hour of close...  Horrible service horrible food.   Breakfast dishes didn't look too bad but burger was on torn bun,  onion rings were from the onion skins and soaked with grease...  Just not what you expect from someplace that was on DDD on Food TV."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the strip. Diner is spotless and filled with cheerful staff. A must try!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Kelly O's and it was much better than the first.   The diner is always crazy busy and crowded which is to be expected when trying to grab breakfast in the strip.   We walked right in and got two seats at the bar. My husband was happy to see that the orange juice was fresh squeezed. I wasn't so happy about the price ($4 wow. I could buy a whole jug at the store!).   We both ordered eggs Benedict; mine was traditional and my husband had veggie. They were both delicious and very filling (I always feel like I get too much food for breakfast). I ordered the home fries and my husband had the shredded potatoes. You can get them with or without peppers and onions. I preferred the home fries because they had a better flavor.   I was surprised by the price of the meal. $30 for two breakfasts with the bulk of the cost in beverages.  Overall, we did enjoy our experience."}
{"text":"We got a super hearty breakfast here. Sausage gravy and biscuits, toast, eggs, and potatoes with fresh OJ and coffee. Great diner for breakfast."}
{"text":"8/23/17 Update. I was so impressed with my first visit last week, that I went to breakfast there again today with a friend. Food and service outstanding. I love restaurant food consistency. . . especially when it is so,so good!  8/18/17. My siblings and I went there yesterday. We breakfast together every month. Our first time at Kelly O's. But not our last!!  One of the best breakfasts we have ever had. We sampled pancakes, delicious French toast, grits, Belgian waffles, grilled cinnamon rolls, bacon. All excellent. As was the service.   Really tasty. Reasonably priced. Cool place. We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It is a cramped tight space so don't be surprised if your elbow gets bumped a couple of times. Cramped space aside, the food is excellent. I had the stuffed banana pepper omelette which was like... a sausage stuffed banana pepper wrapped in fluffy eggs and smothered in hot italian sauce with cheese. DELICIOUS. Their magical orange juice machine is fun to watch too. They load oranges in top, it whirls around, crushes a few, and out pours your juice. The orange juice is really the star of the show here in the morning. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed. She forgot one orange juice, topped off coffee one time, and it was obvious she was hoping we would leave so she could turn the table over for the next group. Last but most important, if you go here on a Saturday, you better be here by 8 am or there will be a line out the door. The people in line were all staring wistfully at my orange juice. Now I know how a cute puppy must feel in a pet store."}
{"text":"Wow what a place. Prob the best breakfast I've ever had. Sausage gravy was on point. The home fries were the best I've ever had hands down and the coffee was on point. Brother had French toast and he thought it was the best he ever had. Might make the 5 hr drive back just for breakfast sometime"}
{"text":"This is a great diner. The food is served quickly and it is always very good. I always order breakfast. The portions are quite large and the price is low."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long day.. good coffee and great service. As far as food, there's something for everyone. I HIGHLY recommend this for a breakfast stop."}
{"text":"Kelly-Os is a great Pittsburgh diner. The food is fairly priced, delicious, and fast. Their fresh-squeezed orange juice is the best orange juice ever.  The French toast isn't anything special (and not recommended), but the pancakes are nice and fluffy. This is one of my boyfriend's favorite places to get Eggs Benedict in Pittsburgh. Some of the waiters/waitresses are nicer than others, so one thing they can work on is better overall friendliness. However, I always have a nice time with good company and great food."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere, the wait staff was nice and the food came out on time. I love diner food and Kelly o's did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Barely Strip District.  I think most ppl consider Strip District (the shops) to be Penn Ave from 17th to 23rd St. So 24th St and Smallman is like 2 blocks walking distance. Having said that, Kelly O has a parking lot.  So definitely stop-by and eat before seeing Strip District.   Kelly O is newer (OMG it's 5 years already, I remember seeing its renovation) and clean.  I also like that fact that it has items of small portion. My mum doesn't eat much, and she had either a \"two eggs and toast\" ($4), or \"Breakfast sandwich\" ($4).  Freshly squeezed orange juice is a plus.   100% will be back.  I want to try their Crab Egg Benedict.  No menu on yelp here. just check out their website."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I were super excited to try Kelly O's after hearing some super awesome things. Unfortunately, our experience was not so super. The server that took our drink order was super nice and very fast. After we received our drinks, we ended up sitting there for 10 minutes before a different server came by to take our food order.  Our chili and soup came out pretty quick. The chili was lukewarm and super bland. 35 minutes went by and we still had not gotten our entrees. It also was not busy at all inside. Not even have to the tables/booths were being occupied. We asked our server to check on our food and she said that they were waiting on our fries. Clearly we were either forgotten about or they were short staffed. We had to have our server box up our food before it even arrived to us as we had spent almost an hour inside and had to get back to work.  My co-worker was comped for her entree but I was not. We didn't realize this until we were on our way back to the office. When I called to see why she was comped and I was not, the floor manager told me that it was their mistake and that my co-worker should not have been comped. She said that she conferred with our server and that they didn't see any need to issue any sort of refund. I ended up paying over $14.00 for a tiny cup of bland chili, cold fries, and a tuna melt that was not \"melted\" at all.  The manager I spoke with was quite nice, but not willing to budge. She said if she would have known that our food was taking long then she would have rectified the situation while we were there. I explained that she would have known if she had done a table touch, or even walked over to the general area where we were sitting. We never met the manager.The server knew we were dissatisfied. That should have been enough to earn a visit from the manager. Kelly O's penny pinching, money hungry attitude and lack of ANY customer service was enough to make me spend time to write this review. I would definitely think twice about spending your well earned money here."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep it simple...  Their food is really good, I just wonder why the waitress made it sound like my potatoes came with onions and pepper when I was charged $1 extra for them.  She did the same to my husband with his pancakes, he was charged a $1 extra for the bananas.  We don't mind getting add ons, but the way she phrased it, you'd think that was part of the meal. Not cool.  I ordered Vegetarian Eggs Benedict which came with homefries. It does say about adding mushrooms for 50¢ extra, nothing about onions and peppers being lavishness.   The coffee was on our table at light speed, the food at a reasonable time since they were so busy. Parking is plenty on a Sunday. We may come back."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at this diner today and I must say everything was very tasty. We also appreciated the friendliness of the waitstaff. Attached you will find a few photos of our meals. The diner has also appeared on Guy Fieri's show. Will definitely return again very soon!"}
{"text":"Best diner in town. I've only been here for breakfast but I've gone to both locations, strip district and north hills. There's a waitress at the strip district that is really awesome. They use good quality ingredients. I'd recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh fruit cup, any of the eggs Benedict (it's done perfectly) and they even have fried mush!"}
{"text":"Want to go get good breakfast at 5 AM and not go to an Eat n Park? Kelly O's is open! I knew Kelly's would be a decent place, not because it was on Triple D, but because it was decently packed at 5:30 AM.  I got the Loaded Waffle with Bacon- large waffle with bacon bits inside that also comes with whipped cream and powdered sugar. It was great! Waffle was fluffy and it was packed with bacon. He got Chicken Fried Steak (at 5 AM..yikes!) and it came with Shredded Potatoes and Mancini's Toast. He killed it.   I liked the classic diner atmosphere and would love to be back. There is also a private parking lot, and they take CCs."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go, staff is totally approachable :) very comfortable and welcoming place. Well manners are greatly appreciated here :) Food was delicious. I recommend the Turkey pot pie and the french toast. Gregory Scott's Favorite is now Leo's favorite :D thank you Kelly, family and staff! Love two pleased new yorkers"}
{"text":"I came here with my parents during breakfast time on a trip to Pittsburgh. There was a decent wait when we got here, but we were seated within 15 minutes. I had chicken noodle soups, my dad had pancakes, and my mom had one of the egg breakfasts. The menu is extensive, with all the breakfast staples as well as some unique items. Service was fast and the food was good! We didn't try to Triple-D suggestions, but it is also fun to come to a restaurant that has been featured on the food network.  If I lived nearby, I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service from Kelly O's. Our server brandon is always on top of his game and the staff does a good job of flipping tables to sit people that are in a constant line waiting for a table. Kelly o's also has some of the best sausage gravy in the city and the most interesting omelets. Love it!! Please remember you are at a diner where the staff has been there since 4am and not a 5 star restaurant. Love Kelly o's and will continue to return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to take guests visiting me in Pittsburgh! The food is great and comes out fast"}
{"text":"We went to Kelly O's in the Strip for breakfast today.  We had taken the day off work and thought it would be a nice way to start the day.  We had been there before and had always enjoyed the breakfast.  Nothing outstanding but it is always the least crowded breakfast spot in the Strip and has a parking lot so it was a good choice.  After our experience today we will never return.  It was not crowded when we arrived so we immediately got a seat.  After 5 minutes our waitress came and gave us menus and took our drink order.  She delivered our drinks and we placed our order.  After 40 minutes of waiting for our food our waitress came over and told us that the kitchen had lost our order.  She took our order again and told us they would expedite our food.  20 minutes later we finally got part of our meal.  My daughter and I had ordered eggs over easy, bacon, home fries and Italian toast.  My husband had ordered a bacon/cheese omelette, hash browns and rye toast.  We received everything except the hash browns and home fries which ended up arriving 10 minutes later.   As far as the food the Italian toast was cold, there was no cheese in my husband's omelette and our bacon (which had always been good in the past) was only ¼ to  1/2 inch wide.  The three pieces put together did not equal the size of a normal piece of bacon.  But at that point we just wanted to leave and enjoy the rest of our day.   What made it worse was that, after telling us that our order had been lost,  our original waitress never said another word to us.  She totally ignored us and was rather rude.  On the bright side the waitress who took over for her was very apologetic and didn't charge us for the meal.  All in all ,a very disappointing meal and we will definitely not return."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place. The food what stellar. From the bacon to the steak & eggs to the country friend steak & eggs. The atmosphere was warm and fun. If you're in the area and looking for great food but not uptight setting, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the last couple visits. Have gone to this establishment since it opened. Initially a great place, but it is now marginal. Today, a simple breakfast is over easy eggs came out so over cooked, I could have made egg salad. Get back to the basics and hire a few more cooks. Won't go back."}
{"text":"After all the hype behind KellyO's and Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I was disappointed by my first visit here. It should be noted, although, that I dined in for breakfast and not lunch. I ordered classic Eggs Benedict along side one of their \"famous\" grilled cinnamon rolls. I'll save you the pain of reading about the Eggs Benedict. It was awful, and there is no other way to describe it. The sole upside to the whole experience was the grilled cinnamon roll. These things SHOULD be famous. Other than that, not much is going right here. Bad service, bad environment, bad food. Safe to say that this diner is just overrated due to Guy Fieri's visit here. I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"WAITRESS WAS A TOTAL BITCH. I came in with my two kids (7 and 9) today (12/6/2014) at 2.45pm.  We went to sit down at a booth and were asked not to sit there \"because we just cleaned that side for tomorrow.\"  So we sat on the other side.  Before we were asked what we wanted to drink she asked in a rushed and annoying tone \"Well is this going to be cash or credit?\" I told her \"I don't know\".  She walked away and said something under her breath that I couldn't hear.  She came back about 30 seconds later with our utensils and asked \"what do you want?\".  I said \"i don't know yet.\" So she leaves us for a few minutes and comes back then takes our order.  Food was average at best.  Food is comparable to a Kings or Eat-N-Park except the space is small and dirty.  If the waitress was a sweet girl that didn't act like a total bitch the experience would have been what I expected...an ok burger in a little diner.  Not great, not bad...but good enough.  But, this girl was the worst waitress I've ever had in my life.  Long dark hair, brown eyes and an absolute bitch.  How can this place employ someone like this is beyond my comprehension.  If she's this miserable with only one table what is she like when that dump is packed on a Sunday morning?    Do yourself a favor and avoid the Kelly O's diner on Perry Highway!    Oh, and don't bother using the bathroom that literally is in the middle of the kitchen.  We went in to wash our hands before our meal and right as you open the bathroom door which is just a few feet from where they grill your food is the toilet.  I opened the door and inside the toilet was a monster turd that someone didn't flush.  I can only assume that the classless person that decided not to flush that log down the toilet was none other than our bitchy waitress.   SUMMARY:  Waitress was a bitch and acted so annoyed and bothered that we were in there.  Restaurant was dirty.  Only bathroom is in the kitchen.  I hope the owner reads this review and fires that waitress. I'm sure there are many people in the area that could use a job and would do a much better job than this girl.  If you don't fire her then at least stop letter her eat for free so she doesn't leave any more huge shits in the toilet for all the customers to ponder.  Good Lord what the hell are you people thinking?  Something tells me Guy from Diner Drive-In's and Dives didn't get treated like shit by a super annoyed waitress..."}
{"text":"Had the best veggie omelette here and the home fries complemented it very well. The staff is mature, friendly and truly cares about your experience. Again, veggie omelette was close to heaven."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and I love diners, so I was pretty eager to check out Kelly O's.  It definitely lived up to my expectations!  I got the \"World Famous Breakfast\" which consisted of two eggs, homefries or shredded potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast.  I got the homefries with green peppers and onions and felt that they were absolutely amazing.  Crispy, but not burnt.  Peppers and onions were a perfect addition and really shouldn't be missed.  The bacon was crispy, not greasy and limp.  And the toast is Mancini's, and if there's one thing I love, it's Mancini's.  Was the breakfast super creative and out of the box as far as a concept?  No.  But was it perfectly executed and the ideal picture of a good diner breakfast?  Yes!  Loved the décor inside with the great diner feel.  My only complaint really was the booths.  My church pews at my Catholic elementary school were probably more comfortable.  Straight up and down in the back, no padding, and very narrow.  Two medium adults JUST fit.  If you're big boned and try to fit two people in there, it's not going to be pretty.  Overall, will DEFINITELY be back.  Love the food, service, the Pittsburgh love throughout."}
{"text":"Tried out this diner for brunch today after searching yelp for a breakfast place. I was sold when I read it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it was recommended on Spoon University. I ordered the OMG Breakfast and my dad ordered the Red, White, and Blue Waffle so we could split (savory and sweet). They forgot the blackberries that were listed as coming with the waffle, but it was yummy nonetheless with strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and whipped cream. You don't even need syrup for it to taste good; it was dense and fluffy! The eggs were a little bland, and the hash browns were a little buttery and not crispy enough. I liked the Italian bread, though! Our waitress was friendly and the service was quick. You get PLENTY of food for the price-the portions are super generous!"}
{"text":"do not eat at this restaurant... the owners are racist and prejudice... as a previous employee i am more than willing to admit that the food is sub par majority of the kitchen staff does not wear gloves when handling food... you can see it for yourself because there is a wide open window... danielle is the worst of the worst she is loud and obnoxious and verbally uses profanity in the dining room... the food is not at all served with quality it is slapped onto a plate be very very careful when ordering any of the tuna or chicken salad because they have swapped tuna for chicken in the past... you will most likely hear during your visit to kelly os the absurd screaming and shouting from the owners whether it is the crazy kelly or the sadistic seana there is chaos all through that diner.... save your money and stay far away from crazy kelly os!!!! do not support this racist and prejudiced business.... they will serve you cold food and will refuse to void it... i have watched this madness firsthand if you are willing to wait for mediocre food and terrible service then by all means kelly os is the place for you but if you value your wallet and enjoy good quality food then stay as far away from this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the original breakfast sandwich, no sides, which I thought was reasonably priced at under $5.00.  Although the sandwich and service were both fine, I was surprised to see I was charged $2.00 extra for the lettuce and tomato I ordered on my sandwich.  Maybe this was written somewhere in the fine print of the menu, but regardless, $1.00 for 1 leaf of lettuce, and another $1.00 for 1 sickly slice of tomato?  Had our waitress or cashier asked me how everything was, I would have shared my thoughts with them directly, and not been compelled to write this review.  As it stands, I feel gouged, and will not return."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of Saturdays with my girlfriend for a brunch type meal.  We weren't necessary looking to eat at Kelly O's and a long time ago I had eaten at the original one in the North Hills.  However, we were looking for a place to eat in the strip and it caught our attention as we were about to leave the strip and so we decided to stop in and check it out.  The inside of the place is decorated in what most people would consider normal diner décor.  Booths, a counter, knick knacks and many pieces are devoted to their claim to fame of being on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\".   Whenever we got there the place was full except for a table that had just opened up that a bus boy was cleaning.  He immediately finished cleaning, took our drink orders and a waitress arrived with menus.  I looked it over for a couple of minutes and couldn't find anything that jumped out at me.  Finally I decided on the O.M.G. Breakfast which I got as two scrambled eggs, shredded potatoes, hot sausage and Mancinis toast while my girlfriend had a similarly hard time picking and ended up choosing an omelet.  After we had ordered my girlfriend and I were discussing where she was going to head to brunch with some of her friends in the future and I looked up their menu on my phone.  Talk about food envy!  That is never a good sign whenever your food hasn't even arrived yet and you are already unhappy you didn't go elsewhere.  In any case, 29 minutes later (I normally don't time these things but it was a coincidence that I knew when I ordered and it took a long time) my meal came out.  I wouldn't say OMG about it as it was a sausage patty next to some eggs and hash browns.  After waiting for a minute or two for my girlfriends meal to come out ,she encouraged me to eat mine before it got too cold and so I did.  Finally about 5 minutes after my meal came out she received her omelet.  The sausage and toast were easily the best part of my breakfast as the sausage had some spice and the Mancinis toast was slathered with butter making it really good.  Then there were my eggs and hash browns which seemed to be lacking any seasoning at all and I ended up getting some hot sauce in order to make eating them more enjoyable.  In the end it was a fairly mediocre meal with entirely too long of a wait in my opinion for breakfast food and some bad serving habits (my meal 5 minutes before my girlfriends).  The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back here in the future.  I will say that was happy with the price of the food but I guess that you often get what you pay for and that combined with the general slowness made for a not so great experience.  I do believe that my experience the first time in the North Hills one was much better though."}
{"text":"Average food and absolute worst service I've ever experienced in my life. Honestly thought I was being punked. I have never witnessed such hateful waitresses in my life."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for breakfast in Pittsburgh!  Just about everything here screams quality, variety, and great service.  A few items:  Most of the clientele here is distinctly local.  While I was there, several groups of police officers and firefighters stopped by, some for just take-out service.  When you walk in the door, you can see it is well-lit, clean, and welcoming.  I was a single diner today, and I could not feel more welcomed.  The menu is not overly-extensive (good!) and you can see they concentrate on things they do well.  Extremely fresh ingredients, not overly sauced or salted.  The Mancini Bread tastes amazing - it's a don't miss item and is served with most items.  Service was very friendly and professional - they always kept an eye on me, and I wanted for nothing, but they NEVER intruded when it was clear that I was reading the paper.  It is about 2 blocks past most of the more \"hyped\" areas in the Strip, so it gets way more local folks than the more touristy places like Deluca's, and there was NO line - just a very steady progression of what appear to be local customers.  A great value with great food and service."}
{"text":"This place's chocolate chip pancakes are a MUST. This place is affordable, great tasting and the servers are incredibly warm and friendly, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I've been to Kelly O's a few times. I actually enjoy it a bit more than Pamela's.  If you're dining on the weekend, it can be a little crazy. Be prepared to wait if your entire party doesn't arrive together. During the week, the rules are put aside and you can sit and wait for others to come in.  The service is pretty friendly and food to table time is pretty average.  I haven't had their orange juice, but they squeeze it on site. It looks really yummy.  Most recently, I ordered a side of their mush (polenta) and a breakfast sandwich with pepper jack cheese and two slices of bacon on top. I ordered the egg fried. I should have been specific, but I expected the egg to be at least a little runny. Instead, it was pretty dry. The cheese wasn't melted. In fact, it was still cold.  The mush was fried (3 rectangular pieces), served with a side of maple syrup. Polenta is pretty boring on its own, so I was hoping the syrup would liven it up. It did not.   My boyfriend ordered one of the omelette specials: pulled pork/beef with bbq sauce. We both ordered this the previous time we were at Kelly O's and enjoyed it. He noted that it was just as good as the first time. It was served with a few slices of white bread and their home fries."}
{"text":"First time here, typical diner, we had one brand new waitress and one who's been there for a while ... When you order please  be sure they hear your order because mistakes tend to occur! Breakfast was typical didn't like the bacon, Very fatty, Shoulda had it cooked well done! Ordered no butter on the toast and it came with butter, had to send it back... but by the time the toast came out eggs became cold! Didn't like that..    But overall not to bad !"}
{"text":"Previous review still stands but adding another star because since that last review the food was better. Tip: Order the Turkey Pot Pie Soup, It's really great!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Has free parking; we got here at 8:45 am on a Saturday, beautiful Saturday, which is an important detail when venturing to the Strip District, we had four in our group and sat immediately. Service was friendly and fast. Atmosphere is loud, which I personally really like, and it was really clean. Chocolate chip pancakes are on the menu, a plus if you have lucky kids. I do. Coffee was smooth and the bread used for my breakfast sandwich was so good and fresh. Booth, table, & bar seating. I've been looking for a really great breakfast place to visit on the regular and Kelly O's will be at the top of my list. There is really nothing negative to say about our experience."}
{"text":"I honestly cannot fathom why anyone would give this place a good review.  I saw a lot of 5s.  That's unheard of.  You reserve 5s for ridiculously good restaurants that shock the conscience when it comes to good food.  Kelly O's is, quite possibly, one of the worst Denny's style diners I've ever been to.  It's turkey and gravy are like moist leather soaked in vomit.  The mashed potatoes may as well be instant because they are marred by an inedibility that rivals the three little bears' porridge.  There must be a strange cult following of white trash diners that prefer eating terrible food in a strip mall because this place simply should not exist.  I know it was on Triple D, but puh-lease.  Rumor has it Guy Fieri was vomiting outside the Shop N Save after the shoot.  Fail."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak and eggs I've found in town. Gravy was tasty but could've used more of it, eggs cooked properly, steak breading nice and crispy. Quick coffee refills and friendly service, cozy little diner feel. I'd definitely go back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"It's all about the haluski.  I never visit Pittsburgh without stopping at Kelly-o's for haluski.  I've eaten plenty of other things there and I suppose they were all o.k., but I don't remember them. I don't remember anything about the waitstaff or the price (though I'm sure they were fine).  All I remember is the haluski, every time. The haluski is fabulous.  If you've been there and not tried the haluski, perhaps you should write your own review, but you have to go back.  Every bit as good as the original Kelly-o's, which is a much longer drive from downtown. I suppose everyone should drive out to the original at least once, but everything about the new downtown location is true to the original.  Did I mention the haluski?"}
{"text":"This was a first time experience for me. I thought it was a good breakfast. You get lots to eat for a small amount of money. The servers were excellent, super friendly and willing to get you anything you need. Great old fashioned atmosphere.   Dislikes- uncomfortable seating in the booths. I do not like the fact that they have real orange juice freshly squeezed."}
{"text":"As good as a diner can get.  Excellent normal menu, plus a bunch of rotating specials usually including a sweet pancake, omelette and some kind of decadent breakfast combo.  Great french toast.  An awesome automatic orange juice squeezer that impresses the kid in all of us.  Service is quick once you get seated, but it does get packed at \"rush hour.\""}
{"text":"I'm ashamed of myself for not eating here til today. I got the bacon, home fries, eggs over easy and rye - the prototypical breakfast. Everything was fresh, the bacon delicious, potatoes filling and crispy, and giant rye bread toasted to perfection. Will certainly come back for more!"}
{"text":"It's amazing how they serve that many people in this small of a place with such a small kitchen. Service is quick and friendly. An extremely professionally run diner."}
{"text":"Creative diner food well done. Featured on Triple-D which has helped its popularity tremendously. Great service by friendly staff. Expect a long wait at prime times."}
{"text":"Good Eggs Benedict. Coffee not good-please clean the coffee maker!   Cinnamon roll was not good-it's fried in too much butter and not enough sugar and cinnamon   Also ladies restroom broken toilet and towel dispenser."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant.  Waited 10 min for first cup of coffee, no menu, no silverware  The food was good, the best OJ I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Kelly O's never disappoints! But today my experience was a thousand times better. Our waitress Chloe went above and beyond to make our time there very enjoyable. She was constantly checking in but not hovering too much. She was such a sweetheart, Kelly O's should be very happy to have her!"}
{"text":"Traditional local diner food in small town America. Reminds me of the truckstop food of my childhood family roadtrips. Nothing too fancy or extraordinary but definitely filling.  After the waitress described mush as fried polenta, I ordered the meatloaf and turkey pot pie soup. Meatloaf was average with mashed potatos that may have been from powder. Turkey pot pie soup was almost certainly reheated, creamy and pretty nondescript. Overall nothing stood out about the food.  Service was good and parking plentiful. I would't go out of my way, but if in the neighborhood and hungry, Kelly O's may be a good spot to stop by."}
{"text":"Good diner food! Comfortable, cozy, friendly. Coffee is steaming and filled up constantly.  Love the specials on the board!  Eggs Benedict, crabmeat omelets...yum!  All the basics, too, served alongside Mancini's toast...talk about Pittsburgh classics!  Fried mush has always been my fav.  Who knew it could be even better with just a touch of crumbled bacon?! Just the right balance of salty and sweet. This is a great place to start your day off with smiles and kind words from all.  Yay Kelly-O!"}
{"text":"I got Seana's Favorite with the French toast instead of the pancake which was a recommendation from the waitress and boy was she right! Scrambled eggs were cooked just right and the bacon and sweet sausage patties was the perfect protein portions for this meal. Portions were definitely satisfying but didn't leave me feeling stuffed! Great food for a great price!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food!  Travelled from Chicago to try Guy Fieri recommendation of Kelly O's.  Turns out our waitress is from our hometown, from a Chicagoland suburb.  Waitstaff vey friendly and attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Man oh man this place was good. The best diner food I have ever had. We were seated quickly and our waitress was great. I couldn't decide between the biscuits and gravy and the grilled cinnamon roll, so I got both. I'm so glad I did because both were completely amazing. My sister ordered the chicken, feta and spinach omelette and it was insanely good as well. The coffee was eh, but that's not unusual for a diner, and nothing some extra sugar and cream can't fix. The incredible food by far makes up for the unimpressive coffee. I will absolutely be coming back here next time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, diner-style. Mine was corned beef hash and scrambled eggs, complete with hash browns, toast, and good coffee.  Fast and friendly, folksy service.  Great food at a good price. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"HOW CAN YOU EVER COMPLAIN?! Go there! HUGE portions, quick service and simply the best breakfast in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"absolutely terrible. their menu lies about the prices. cost 20$ for two burgers. lettuce tomato and onions are all 50c extra too. dont go here. the food is mediocre and expensive."}
{"text":"The food and the coffee here is excellent! This a charming little diner with the typical decor. The place is very clean. I liked the fact that they have a chalk board specials menu in addition to their regular menu. It took a little while to get waited on, the coffee refills went a bit slow, and we had to wait a bit for the check. The food came out at an appropriate pace. Many of the dishes come with Mancini's bread (local bakery). Everything that we ordered was cooked perfectly with the right amount of spices. After speaking with a few locals they commented that this is their favorite diner in the area. DDD has been here and they have also been featured on a local TV station, write ups,etc."}
{"text":"We were downtown for an appointment and found ourselves too early for lunch.  I was driving through the Strip toward East Liberty when we spied this building.  And how could we not see it?!  One side of the building is completely painted with mural-like images and the words EAT HERE so large that even my wife with eyes just dilated could see it. I took that as an omen, and turned right.  The parking lot is small and maneuvering is tight.  (I might have parked on the sidewalk.)  Today was cold and damp, and I was looking forward to something very hot. The interior is very bright and warm, and noisy in a good way.  You could hear all the voices but not make out anyone's conversations.  I started with coffee which tasted good and was hot.  For breakfast, I got two over easy eggs, bacon, Italian bread, and fresh fruit.  It was very good.  The bread was a treat.  It was about an inch thick with a good crust.  The service was quick, friendly, and unobtrusive.  In short, we had a very pleasant meal and enjoyed our time there.   While sitting we noticed that this place was on Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives for some lunch items.  We'll be back in Pittsburgh next month, maybe then we'll try lunch!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Kelly-O's. The first time wasn't that great, but this time was significantly better. I got the breakfast burrito and man was it awesome: stuffed full with cheese, eggs, and onions and peppers. My wife got the Seana's Favorites and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was cooked to order and to our liking. There was a line to get in, but it moved quickly. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I always trust my man #GuyFieri on great spots to eat, and am a loyal fan of #DinersDriveinsandDives. However this spot has either lost its flavor or just really made a great impression for the fame. Food was tasteless, service was horrible and just rude. 1star for the cleanliness as well. An employee was wiping walls, seats, and tables with the same rag.  #KellyOMyGross"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast on Sunday and sat at the counter and I was treated right away and everyone was so friendly. I ordered an omelette and it was delicious! Great food and the servers are awesome!"}
{"text":"We went to Kelly O's on a Sunday around 11am. There was a line to get seated, but it moved quickly. The diner is small and there's not a lot of room to move around. The waitress who seated us was super friendly and even got our drinks started. The waitress for our table was not very friendly. She came to ask for our drink order and we tried to tell her that it was already taken and she unpleasantly said something along the lines of she was our server and she'd need our order. So we ordered the drinks again and had to have he tell our server she had gotten them already. This was our first visit and we were having trouble deciding exactly what to get. Our server was not very helpful and seemed annoyed when we asked for her opinion while placing our order.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed to order- and was delicious. I ordered \"Seana's Favorite\" which was two eggs, two meats, and two sweets. I chose double bacon for the meat and the French toast for the sweet. Overall the breakfast tasted good and I would return. They were super quick to clear dirty dishes. Service could definitely have been friendlier and more helpful but wasn't necessarily rude either."}
{"text":"Guy Fieri featured this restaurant on his show. Try the Haluski and Polenta with Bolognese sauce. Not fancy stuff, just comfort food."}
{"text":"Dammit. I wish Kelly O's was open 24 hours. Or at least for dinner. IT'S SO DAMN GOOD! I love me some well-prepared comfort food! They have the best burgers in town and possibly anywhere. The meat is wonderful, and they prepare it just the way you want it. The buns are delicious too. Fluffy little angel's bread thingies. No gross monstrosity burgers here. Just honest, thin, old-fashioned diner burgers where you can actually taste the beef. But you can load them up if you want. Try their breakfast sandwiches too. Their biscuits are phenomenal. I am sorry to report that I can't comment on other dishes because I'm stuck in my ways. I'm sure everything else is delicious too. Maybe it's a good thing they're only open until 3 pm. I would have to have a mobility scooter to get there, and that front door is a bitch to open."}
{"text":"During the course of  exploring the Strip District of the city I was looking forward to having a pub-style lunch somewhere in the area. Unfortunately, the place I was hoping to visit was closed on Sunday (should have checked the listing on yelp!).   I walked into Kelly O's (which must be 180 degrees from a pub setting) to find a bustling diner filled with guests of all ages and descriptions. My server, Andrea, approached the table with 45 seconds and took my order. While tempted to have something from the Sunday extended breakfast menu, I opted for a cup of Turkey Pot Pie soup and \"Classic\" patty melt.   The tasty soup arrived quickly and hot (and I mean HOT!) and included a nice piece of crust and chunk of turkey. The sandwich was also good (hot), rye bread perfectly toasted, good cheese melt and burger cooked to the temperature.  In spite of the business levels and somewhat cramped quarters there was no level of chaos at Kello O's. Instead, servers moved about smoothly while delivering orders and every departing guest was warmly thanked for their visit. The patron mix ranged from children to folks well into their 80's. And, there was an obvious mix of \"regulars\" and first timers like me. Andrea was conversational, refilled my beverage without request and provided me with much appreciated information about the District. By the way, the place,including restroom, was remarkably clean which is saying plenty when considering the number of people that obviously went through the place.   It's nice to visit a place that doesn't try to be \"something they're not.\" The menu is straightforward and genuine, the food is \"as promised,\" the staff is friendly and connected with their customers.  I'll likely visit again with friends and family."}
{"text":"I used to come here when I still lived in Pittsburgh a few years ago. When the owners were coming in more frequently, the service was a lot better. My boyfriend and I are in town from NC and last minute decided to go get breakfast here. It was 2:50 (ten minutes before close) when we arrived. We walked in and one male server with blonde hair sarcastically chuckled (how welcoming...) because the other server was going to be taking care of us so close to closing time. Our server, \"Staci\" had an attitude from start to end. How she has a job baffles me. Throws down our silverware and asks what we want, we ask for another minute, she comes back and says \"what are you getting?\" As if we can't have one more second to look at the menu....brings out food with one less piece of toast stating the other piece got burnt but then brought out another burnt piece as a substitute..weird. She doesn't come back over until we are finished and just throws the check down. We wrote a note on the bill explaining how we work in the restaurant industry and she would've got a 100% tip if she didn't act so rudely. I hope the owners find new servers who will treat the customers right and appreciate having a job."}
{"text":"I like the North Hills location just a little bit better, but this is nice, too.  I'm loving the free parking lot in the Strip, that's for sure!  The service was a little slow, but it turns out the server was just waiting for the rest of the group, which never showed.  I had Raisin French Toast, something I've never had from Kelly O's before, so I can't compare it to the cooking at the original location, but it was the same generous portion I've come to expect from Kelly O's.  I loved the coffee, too; generous refills are always noted!  The rest of the table enjoyed their meals - clean plates all around."}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing and the house made orange juice was the best! A lot of food for a little bit of money"}
{"text":"We stopped by the diner for a late lunch.  It reminded me a lot of the greasy spoons from when I was a kid, just a lot less greasy.  The hostess and wait staff were super friendly and accommodating.  The place was busy, but the wait time was short.  I ordered the polenta bolognese and iced tea.  I never had to ask for a drink refill, which is great thing.   The sauce was common, but tasty and well seasoned, and the ice cream scoop-sized polenta balls were firm and soaked up the bolognese for a tasty mix.  The serving size was large for the price, I couldn't finish.  I'd go again, if in the area, but not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My father and I sat at the counter yesterday morning. There was a line to get in, although it moved quickly, we seemed to be in the middle of the breakfast rush. Kelly O's definitely has an authentic diner atmosphere. From our seat at the counter we had a great view of the kitchen. They were slammed but managing it well!   Food was great! I ordered the daily special of the Kielbasa and Swiss Mixed Grill. My father had the Cinnamon Raisin french toast. One of the best mixed grills I've ever had! We are big breakfast people and the food is 5-star. Took awhile to get our order, but that's more due to our poor timing (we could clearly see the kitchen staff busting their butts to fill orders).  Waitstaff was friendly. Handled an unruly/rude customer better than I would have. Kelly O's is right up there with Deluca's and Pamela's for me. Seemed a little less touristy which was nice!  I would come back here for breakfast.   **** I highly recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice! I could drink a gallon of it in one sitting. So refreshing!"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch from Kelly O's Diner, the \"chef's favorite\" turkey sandwich. If you want dried turkey between flat white bread topped with gravy from a box as well as soggy, formerly frozen French fries with no seasoning, I recommend this diner. If this isn't your taste in food, do not waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Just had the OMG Breakfast with hot sausage on mancinis and shredded potatoes with peppers and onions.  I also watched my orange juice being freshly squeezed.  Friendly servers. Have breakfast here when in strip district."}
{"text":"This place was great. Great food, great service, and great atmosphere. Sat at the bar and got to watch the staff in action. True team effort. Everyone was happy to be there and happy to help...and it showed in the food. Will definitely be back and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I always end up at Kelly O's after a huge study session. This is definitely a place where you indulge yourself with comfort breakfast foods: eggs, bacon, toast, coffee, etc. As long as you don't expect something fancy, this is a good place for you. I always get the World Famous Breakfast and a side of the grilled cinnamon roll to go. The first time I came here, the bacon was too greasy but a quick dab with my napkin cleared up the problem. The following visits were so much better. The food was consistently delicious, and I find myself wanting to come here just for the cinnamon roll. It's definitely not a place I would go to every morning but is a diner that picks up my spirits when I come here. An added bonus is the quick service. There was never a time when I was waiting too long for a check or to give my order. If you want some comfort food for breakfast, definitely check Kelly O's out!"}
{"text":"The Chick With The Neck Tattoo is named Fawna, and you should get to know her for she is a hoot, a doll, a dear, and a trip to Nola for Mardi Gras. God Love Her.  She waited on me during an ungodly early pre-work breakfast (6AM! I'm insane!) recently, and I couldn't have been more pleased by her work ethic and personality.   Hey, fearing for my safety, she even talked me out of getting both the Breakfast Burrito AND a Belgian waffle. Fawna had my back.   \"Lissen baby, you got nothin' to prove ah-ight,\" the tough-looking chick softly cooed into my ear.   Having typed that out, I have very little to complain about regarding my initial experience with the nationally-famed Kelly O's, this secondary location still being fairly new.   The Mixed Grill I ordered up came with a tender and tempting sweet sausage as per my specifications and were centered around weightless, nigh-cherubic scrambled eggs along with such potent vegetables peppers and onions. Only some more seasoning was required to elevate this to legend.  Arriving at Olympus' gates was the Strawberry Banana Waffle. Its base a golden maze of a crisp-fluffy waffle, topping it was fresh banana, a superbly saccharine strawberry marmalade sort of thing that would make for fine pie filling, and whipped cream.   \"Whew! I wasn't sure you were gonna finish that,\" she told me, sounding as relieved as a prizefighter's girlfriend after an easy knockout.  \"Eh, I beaten bigger,\" I replied, looking at my reflection in the gleaming steel plates that embellish the diner's alabaster walls as I hopped off of my counter stool and into the promising sunrise, hard luck hero that I try to be.   Methinks some of Kelly O's haters are a tad sheltered and privileged.   Don't be skeered o' Kelly. Ok? Come down and eat.   P.S. I didn't see Kelly herself working while I was there, but I can testify that the service was chipper and cordial. Of course, the roughneck gals have always taken a glint to me for reasons I'm unsure of. Winkin' back at ya, love."}
{"text":"Killer breakfast. The hash fries are the best I've ever had and the corned beef hash is very unique as well. Our meal came relatively quickly and the price was reasonable for the amount of food we got. Better than DeLuca's for the price."}
{"text":"Very average breakfast. Canned hash?  Really? Most uncomfortable booths that I have ever sat in. Boring interior, uninteresting decor. Very clean dining area. Nice clean bathrooms. 2 eggs, hash, toast, coffee...$9.00"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Definitely above average with a really great group of waitresses who are definitely are 4+ star team especially at 6 am.  Kelly O's is my first experience with any restaurant shown in the Drive In, Diners, and Dives.  I've always heard about the show but never had the urges to experience them myself.  I found myself needing to wake up waaaay too early and not much is open at 6 am.  Turns out Kelly O's Diner is open at 5 am and so I experienced my first true American diner.   There's a lot of great things going here.   At 6 am, maybe a quarter of the place was filled and the two ladies serving were just having a pleasant conversation.  I loved the fact they have their own parking here.  That is a huge bonus for the area and I didnt have to bother with street parking.  The restaurant is nice & clean, service here is pleasant, it might be a touch slow on getting your bill but the coffee refills are offered and a smile is always there.   The reason why I gave a lower rating is cause of the actual food... I think perhaps I ordered wrong.  I got a mixed grill from the Breakfast Favourites section and maybe I should have gotten a simpler omelette instead.    Mixed Grill - It's described as eggs, home fries, onions, green peppers, and cheese all mixed up.  I was thinking a scrambled egg looking dish with vegetables and crunchy pieces of potato in it and a bit of melted cheese.  It wasn't quite that.  The home fries were mushy and not crunchy ... more like pieces of boiled potato.  And the vegetables were all a bit undercooked so the onion had more of a bite to it than I was expecting and probably overpowered the eggs.  Overall, I could only taste rawish onions.  I will give it that it was a big dish... so from a quantity perspective, you don't need to order more.  This could easily feed 2 people.  I had to douse it with a bit of hot sauce to tame the onion flavour. 3/5  Overall, it was fast, clean, affordable, and service was good... simple food done quickly and served with a smile.  I would give it a try here again but perhaps not the Mixed Grill!"}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try a new breakfast place yesterday. We decided to try Kelly O's Diner which is in the strip district. One nice thing is they have there own parking so you do not have to feed the meters. I had 2 eggs over easy bacon and home fries. The eggs where fine and where cooked perfectly the bacon and home fries where just ok nothing special. The service was excellent and the waitress was fast and very friendly. I reluctantly would say I would not go there again for breakfast I would however try them again for something other than eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"Kelly Oh how much I've missed you! This used to be a regular breakfast place for us but for some reason we hadn't been in a while. Well luckily for us, Kelly O's is still in business and still serving up some of the best diner food money can buy. A no-frill, straight to the point, mom and pop place. You want great dining on a budget, then look no further.   Previously featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, Kelly O's is nothing short of perfect. Great, fun, fast paced service and fresh, hearty plates are what make Kelly O's special. Try the Mixed grill served with home fries, fresh eggs, peppers, onions and your choice of cheese to top it. Yum!   Im always amazed at how Kelly O's continues to make dining simple ane easy, but still have it all taste so well at such a cheap price. However thry do it, I hope that they don't change."}
{"text":"Another post-workout Friday brunch. Came here with two of my friends who love Kelly O's and who promised it'd be way better than Deluca's and Pamela's. Most of the restaurant was empty since it was a Friday at 1:30pm, so we didn't have to wait long for our food at all. I got the world famous breakfast with sausage patties and home fries (should've gotten the shredded potatoes, I later realized). It also came with eggs and Mancini's toast. The sausage looked a little burnt and dry, but they were good. Everything else was pretty much up to standard for typical breakfast/brunch food. The best part of the meal though were the cinnamon rolls we ordered to share. So good. I usually don't like cinnamon rolls, but these were amazing. Best I've ever had. Wasn't too happy with the presentation of our food. It seemed like everything was just piled on carelessly, especially the side of shredded potatoes my friend got that was served all on one side of the plate. Then again it's a diner so what can you expect. I did, however, appreciate that the diner was much cleaner than its competitors (no sticky tables). I'm expecting to return since the friends I came here with love Kelly O's, but next time I think I'm going to just order a bunch of the cinnamon rolls.  Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 3.5 Presentation | 2.5 Service | 3 OVERALL | 3.5"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Food is great, service is fantastic! Probably my all-time favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"You usually can't go wrong with a breakfast at a diner & Kelly O's is no exception. They have a small parking lot, which is rare in the Strip District. Decor is what you would imagine a diner to look like-not fancy, loaded with Steelers momentos. They have a large variety of breakfast menu options (also serve lunch & dinners) and also specials, many which relate to Pittsburgh using kielbasa, pierogies or haluski as a main ingredient. Service was quick, friendly & efficient on a freezing New Year's Day at 10am. The coffee was hot & tasty and refills were quick. I had the Pittsburgh Benedict which came with pierogies & kielbasa and 2 eggs on thick sliced Italian bread with Hollandaise sauce and home fries. Add onions & peppers to your home fries or hash browns for 75 cents & they taste so much better. They make fresh squeezed orange juice. My husband had 2 eggs, turkey sausage & home fries all tasty as well and added a pancake as a side which was a 1/2\" thick and as big as a plate. We enjoyed everything & would definitely recommend Kelly O's for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This was my second trip to the diner, and I was skeptical after my initial visit left me disappointed with both the food and the service.  But I have to admit that the kinks seem to be ironed out and the food was MUCH better and our waitress was prompt and even smiled once she new we used words like please and thank you :) The mixed grill was great and a portion big enough to split.  Blueberry pancakes were also delicious, and if im in the mood for a classic diner, I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is your typical little dinner with a cool city twist. I'll go here if I want a simple breakfast or lunch, they have fresh Mancini bread!  Don't let the line out the door scare you because it moves fast! The waitressing are always busting their butts, you'll never wait long for anything in there! Don't try and have a long conversation or ask questions, menu is pretty simple so know what you won't and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, just plain awful!! We were expecting a much better experience since every other restaurant we have been to that was featured on diners drive-ins and dives has been amazing. I ordered the breakfast tacos because a good breakfast taco is a marvelous thing... Not this time! My plate showed up with two flour tortillas fresh out of the package with about a 6 egg scramble dumped on top! I have never seen so much egg in one order before! No cilantro, chorizo, or anything of flavor or color..! Very disappointing. My husband got the haluski and it was the featured dish. It was better than my tacos but nothing to bring us back. This diner needs to spend some time and money on improving the food and less on stamping 'as seen on DDD' on all the glassware, china, napkins and walls!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, although I visit Pittsburgh often.  We came here for breakfast and were not disappointed.  I had the Pittsburgh Benedict.....italian bread, perogies, kielbassa, sautéed onions all layered under two basted eggs and hollandaise sauce.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  My girls got the crab benedict....very good and we shared a grilled cinnamon roll ..yummy.  Our waitress was great as well.  As if there are not already too many choices for food in the strip district....Kelly O's Diner is a must stop.  We have to go back to try the Haluski."}
{"text":"Try the Pittsburgh Eggs Benedict! I'm honestly not a huge pierogi fan, but I figured it would be authentic, and it was. The dish consisted of two over easy eggs, hollandaise sauce, over sauteed onions, kielbasa, pierogies and italian bread. Everything melted together perfectly. I also got the home fries, which were soft in parts, crispy in others.  As for atmosphere: service was good and it was a no-frills diner- bright lights, simple tables/booths, etc."}
{"text":"Visiting the Pittsburgh area on a quick mini vacation With the bf to watch the Packers vs Steelers preseason game.  Randomly stumbled upon this spot but what a jewel it was. Ordered breakfast food and it was amazing. I ordered a basic waffle with eggs & bacon and my bf ordered the steak with potatoes. We were both extremely happy with the food and with our waitress.  We then realized that this spot was featured on Triple D which was awesome. In hindsight we would have ordered what they were famous for lol.  My only issue was when I walked in there was this long line of people waiting. We asked the group in front how long they've been waiting and we were told 30 mins and no one acknowledged them yet.   Anyway highly recommend this spot but be warned it gets packed due to its size. We sat at the bar so took us like 5 mins to be seated."}
{"text":"The last two times we were in for breakfast there was a lot of yelling going on.  I think it was the owner yelling at one of her waitresses about a messed up order.  They were in the back, in the kitchen...you could hear her yelling out in the dining room and what she was saying...wow, lots of curse words were flying.  The food has been good but we won't be going back.  It gets quiet and uncomfortable while she's yelling.  The dining room gets a little quiet and it ruined our breakfast."}
{"text":"I ate here on a quiet Monday morning. Loved the mixed grill breakfast and would have liked to try some of the pancake options - pumpkin, Oreo, etc. The tables could have been cleaner and the staff a little more welcoming.  But overall a good meal."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  I've been to Kelly O's twice.  The first time the food was anything special - so I decided to give them a second chance.    I order the Eggs Benedict.  I received a plate with raw potatoes, over cooked eggs, and yellow syrup that they claimed was Hollandaise sauce.  I sent the dish back.    On the second attempt I asked them to leave off the Hollandaise.  This time I received cold potatoes and undercooked fried eggs - the whites of the eggs were mostly clear.  I asked the waitress why the eggs were fried (if you can it that) instead of poached.  At that point she decided to lecturer me about their kitchen, the cooking methods of their chief, the speed of the wait staff, etc. etc."}
{"text":"Always fresh & super friendly! LOVE our new favorite place and want to tell everyone. We just moved into the neighborhood and feel like we struck gold!"}
{"text":"It is a diner in the Strip.  Staff is friendly, food is good.    They require a $9.00 minimum order for credit/debit cards.  Most menu items are in the $7 range."}
{"text":"I had Gregory Scott's Favorite for breakfast. It was a very classic sausage gravy and biscuits with eggs and shredded potatoes, nothing too fancy. Our server was very attentive and made us laugh. The atmosphere was great not too loud and not too crowded. I live about 8 minutes away in Lawrenceville and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Pittsburgh. I always get an omelette. The chicken spinach and feta is my favorite. Never greasy. Fresh fruit, so the wife is happy too. Although, they don't poach eggs; they just baste them."}
{"text":"This Kelly O's used to be our favorite, but the last two times haven't been that great. They messed up all three aspects of my wife's breakfast. Wrong toast, wrong eggs, and they forgot her side of fruit. They eventually corrected it, and then took her entire meal off the bill, but it's still a disappointment. While the people who work there are nice, in the future we will stick the Strip District location."}
{"text":"This place has the friendliest people in all of Pittsburgh!! They make you feel like family. The food is always great and the coffee cup never empty."}
{"text":"I saw this dinner on the food network. So of course I had to try it. We had about five different dishes all of which were incredible. It's hard to find a place where you love every dish. The service was amazing as well. A+"}
{"text":"No knock against the food, it was very straight forward. The shredded hash browns were very bland, will need some sort of seasoning to eat them. Serves was very friendly as soon as we walked in. Was not able to accommodate my egg allergy  when I asked if I could supplement something for the eggs that came with my country fried steak. Not getting anything higher unless they can go above and beyond. Fine but nothing remarkable. Also way too expensive, with ripe 35 for 2 peoples... Cmon it's a dinner... Stop it."}
{"text":"Been here 2x for breakfast and 2x for lunch in last 2-3 months.  Breakfast...had variety of different things.  I would stick with anything eggs and meat.  Had pancakes once and were a little \"greasy\" for me.  Portions are BIG.  If you leave full, shame on you.  Lunch...  fish sandwich - good tuna melt - real good (friend had it - tasted it - yummy) burger club - good (tried zucchini fries with it which were real good and portion was HUGE)  For what it is...diner, it is well worth the stop!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this Kelly O's location and breakfast was excellent.   Service was outstanding, coffee cup never empty and this was during the full Sunday am rush with every seat in the place filled and people waiting.   My wife had the breakfast special with home fries and I had country fried steak and eggs with shredded potatoes. Meals arrived hot and fast and both types of potatoes were great. Eggs were fresh and the rye toast we had was also served hot and was excellent. Zero complaints about food or service!  This Kelly O's has more of a Diner feel to us than the Strip District location with a livelier, smaller set up that makes it very enjoyable.   We are in this area on a regular basis and this Kelly  O's will definitely be a breakfast go to for us in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for breakfast this morning. We were in a bit of a hurry with 45 minutes to spare. I ordered eggs benedict with the \"meat on a separate plate\" for my husband.  As I explained to the waitress, I'm a vegetarian and did not want the meat to touch the other food. Our order arrived 20 minutes later with the eggs on top of the meat. I asked the waitress to re-fire the order and wrap it to go since I wouldn't have time to eat. The rush reorder took another 20 minutes - the same time as the original.  I would have appreciated a discount or at least a real apology since I had to sit and watch as my husband ate, but that wasn't the real complaint.  My reorder was still wrong!!  This time the meat was thrown on top of the entire meal! 40 minutes waiting, and I still didn't have anything to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and brother and his wife went yesterday after walking around the strip. It had been a while for us and had always had decent experiences. However, yesterday we did not. Everything went fine until we received the bill. My wife built her own egg white omelette that came to over $15! All she ordered was cheese, spinach, tomato, and sausage. Maybe one more ingredient, I can't remember. The waitress explained to me that the base price of $8 only includes the 3 egg whites and cheese and everything else was an up charge. Our bill for two omelettes, OJ, and a side of hash browns was over $40! Almost $4 for a Dixie cup sized OJ. Build your own Omelette Beware!!"}
{"text":"Delicious corn beef hash, shredded potatoes with green peppers and onions! We made sure the cook knew we were happy. Server was very attentive, taking time to chat while making sure we were satisfied. We definitely will be coming back. Nothing beats a local diner!"}
{"text":"The food here was decent for a diner, my steak and cheese omelet was a bit greasy, but that is to be expected for a diner.  Her pancakes were large and she enjoyed them.  The service was a little less than friendly, and also a little less than professional.  Unfortunately, that is what really stuck out at my visit.  My waitress gave the impression that she really did not care to be waiting on our table.  Overall, the experience was OK."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service and great portion size . It's popular so there are times where you might have to wait but as with all things in life you can choose to wait or just go somewhere else that isn't as busy. Outrageous breakfast sandwich is always the bomb. My daughter got the chicken fried steak and eggs with gravy on the side. She said it was solid choice. Great food ,good service."}
{"text":"It was a rare occasion that I was awake and out early on a Saturday morning.  I made the trek from Brighton Heights to Trader Joe's in the East End to do some grocery shopping before the crowds hit and on my way home I toyed with stopping by Coca Cafe but as I drove by around 9 AM it already looked like it was getting busy and being by myself I thought that I'd just go straight home instead.  I cut through the Strip District and as I arrived at the stop sign near Kelly O's I spotted a parking spot in the lot and the fond memories that I had from when the spot was once JoJo's drew me to stop in and give Kelly O's a second try as I had only been there one other time before and that visit had made me miss JoJo's even more...so, I really hoped that this visit would be a fresh start, but sadly, I should have just kept driving home.  I must say that I have really high standards when it comes to breakfast - even though the JoJo's omelet was enough for 3 meals and was possibly a heart attack waiting to happen it was delicious enough to be worth the risk.  I've also had very delicious but healthy breakfasts that I love just as much.  So, let's get to Kelly O's.  The place was busy but had a few empty booths/tables and seemed well-staffed so I was hopeful.    Despite there being an ample amount of staff behind the counter there really wasn't anyone playing hostess.  There was someone waiting in the front entry way and I stood near him waiting to be seated - I stood there for about 2 minutes before I was acknowledged, and that only happened after a larger group of people walked in behind me.  I was seated at a small table that was in a awkward location with a booth directly behind me with a direct line of site behind the counter, though a single diner arrived after me and was seated alone in a large booth along the windows, which had also been available upon my arrival.  My server came over without a menu and asked me if I knew what I wanted or did I need a menu?!?  I told him that, yes I needed a menu because it was only my second time there, and he told me that he was new and that he didn't know who the regulars were yet, and that most of them already knew what they wanted, so off he went to get me a menu.  I ordered a coffee, which took a couple of minutes to arrive, but then I had to ask for not only cream and sugar, but also then had to ask for silverware and a napkin once I realized that was also not already on the table - so already 10 minutes into my visit I had to 1) ask for a menu, 2) ask for cream and sugar after my coffee arrived, and 3) ask for silverware and a napkin - it wasn't looking too promising.  There wasn't anything on the menu that was jumping out at me and I don't eat pork, so I decided to get the country fried steak because in the description it read that it was \"covered in country gravy\" which I assumed was different than the \"homemade sausage gravy\" in the description for the biscuits and gravy, yet, when my breakfast arrived, it arrived with sausage gravy (I should have known better than to make assumptions so this was a good reminder to always ALWAYS ask) so I scraped the gravy off after posting my photo of course.  The country fried steak itself was decent though I haven't eaten country fried steak probably since grade school when it was routinely on the cafeteria menu so I really can't say that I have much to compare it to.  The shredded potatoes were devoid of any seasoning so I asked for ketchup and added salt and pepper (which I rarely do when eating out) and the over hard eggs were also just bland and in need of salt and pepper.  Overall, the whole meal was completely underwhelming.  During my meal, I also had to 1) ask for a coffee refill even though my server had passed by my table at least 3 times and then it took at least 5 minutes before I got a refill and 2) when I was done with my meal, I sat there for another 10 minutes after my plate was cleared waiting for my server who was somehow now stationed at the opposite end of the restaurant to bring my check, which inevitably, I had to ask a different server if she could check me out.  The only other time that I ate here a couple of years ago, it was also an unremarkable experience but I wanted to give them another chance.  It's unlikely that I will return as there are far better breakfast places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Kelly O's and I adore the joint. Yes, it's a dive, but it's my dive, dammit. I'm here at least once a week for breakfast. I'm a sucker for the breakfast sandwich and any of their pancakes - especially the pumpkin ones they whip up in the fall.   The spot itself is tucked into a little strip mall complex, ironically the same one that my gym is in (for extra guilt, I suppose). It can get pretty swamped on the weekends, so I recommend either getting there early or visiting on a weekday. You're not getting white glove service here, and it's certainly not a mimosas and crumpets joint, but the staff is friendly, the food is solid, and the kitchen looks pretty clean.  Minus one star because of all the Guy Fieri crap around. If I wanted to be inundated by Von Douche himself, I'd watch the Food Network."}
{"text":"This place rules! Their breakfast is great and so are their lunch items. The pickles are spectacular definitely get one as a side!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped in for breakfast this Memorial Day Weekend and had the very best breakfast EVER! He had the Boston Cream French Toast and I had the Lobster Omelete. We are regulars at the Pines Plaza and Kelly O's just gets better and better. If you haven't been here yet - what are you waiting for!"}
