{"text":"Food was awful and overpriced. Carpaccio was smothered in mayo and inedible. Tomatoes in Caprese salad were pale and not flavorful. Fries were pale and flaccid. So disappointed as I support Lakewood businesses. Loved its former incarnation, Players. Second time I've been to Sarnitas and most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day and was really looking forward to a good dinner and was excited to try it for the first time. Was completely disappointed. We ordered oysters as an appetizer. As soon as they got to the table we smelled a terrible rotten smell. We started eating without realizing that was where the smell was coming from until I ate the rotten one. It tasted awful. Having had oysters at least once a month for the last few years, we knew this was not right. I let the waitress know and she very rudely told me that that's how oysters are supposed to smell. So we were served rotten oysters and then told we didn't know enough about them and that they were supposed to smell (and taste?) rotten. For the rest of the dinner we couldn't get that terrible taste out of our months nor could we get past how rude the waitress was. Will definitely never ever go back here. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"The language on the menu paints a flowery image of each dish.  The food is eclectic.  The chef has a heavy sea food influence, but there were a few four legged options, along with off menu offerings.  It was all very tasty and the ingredients of high caliber.  The presentation was on point and the preparation thoughtful.  Great place for a date.  Cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Roasted beets and salad were excellent. The rest of our meals were good but nothing special. Ambiance and staff were terrific. Happy Hour was great value."}
{"text":"I love the place! I like to visit a place a few times so I can give a better more accurate review.  Each time I've been there the service has been friendly and the food has been wonderful.  They offer a great happy hour menu (the wings are the best!). The atmosphere is very relaxing I enjoy spending hours there with friends drinking, eating, and talking.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner on the beautiful patio. The service was perfect! We know our server was extremely busy but despite how many tables he had, he answered every menu question we had and was very accurate on the wine descriptions, all while making us feel that we were his only table and main focus. I love the menu and had a hard time decided between the many selections. We decided on the Tuna, Sea Bass and Pasta special. All were excellent dishes but my favorite was the Tuna. Seared perfectly rare, it was a great choice for a hot summer evening."}
{"text":"I got home from work starving and fired up the yelp app as I habitually (and ritually) do when I'm hungry, on the hunt to find something good to satisfy my cravings. I had a craving for seafood and after surfing yelp for 30 minutes I decided Sarita sounded good!   It was the worst meal we (my girlfriend and I) have had in a long time. We aren't picky eaters in the slightest. In fact, on the way home we tried to think of any place we've been to that we didn't even like at all and concluded we haven't had a really bad meal in years.  For starters, the best thing (according to my girlfriend) was the ketchup they put on her burger. I disagreed. I actually thought the beef carpaccio was pretty good. I would order it again. And that's where \"ordering anything again\", ends.   My girlfriend ordered a salad and Kobe burger with fries. I ordered 12 oysters and the tuna tartare. I'll skip my girlfriends food - just know it was bland - and get to mine.   The oysters were disgusting. I've never eaten such a bad oyster in my life. And I've had thousands of oysters. They were warm, dried up and smelled like rotten fish. It looked, and tasted, like someone shucked them the day before and let them sit and rot on a hot rock. How any place could even serve such dry oysters is beyond me. That was the worst. In a close second was the tuna tartare. If you can even call It that. The tuna wasn't even red - more grayish - and every bite was so bland except for the overwhelming taste of wasabi.   Overall, we came in expecting great food and left... defeated. The waiter was great I will say that. Friendly and attentive. If you want a nice waiter come here. If you want good food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"When Players on Madison closed its doors in October 2015, we were excited, but skeptical about what would take over the space. We had visited Players countless times over the years and we were hopeful that Chef Anthony Romano's new restaurant would provide us with a dining experience that would keep us coming back for more. We decided to visit Sarita on a Friday night. Immediately when you walk in the doors, you notice the beautiful transformation. The new bar and community table are fantastic. The chandelier of cooking utensils and bowl artwork are a playful, yet classy design. The décor in general is a great improvement; providing a more modern and open, but still warm ambiance. The old bar was always so awkward and a poor use of space.  The menu is a nice combination of old and new. Versions of our favorite nightly specials from Players, such as the Grouper and Sea Bass, can now be found on Sarita's menu. Chef Romano has also put his own spin on classics with simple ingredients that taste great! The prices are fair and allow us to enjoy a three course meal with drinks without breaking the bank.   We arrived just as they were opening and started at the newly renovated bar with a Manhattan and Cherokee Fry Bread. The Manhattan is a staple that we have enjoyed at this bar many times, so we were not disappointed.  The Fry Bread is a new item and was a crispy, flaky and light dough topped with chicken, black beans, salsa and crème fraiche. They were fairly priced at $6 apiece for happy hour. Next we moved to a table where we enjoyed a beet salad ($10). While we would have preferred a little more goat cheese, the beets were delicate and delicious. For our entrees, we enjoyed the horseradish encrusted grouper with mashed potatoes ($29) as well as the blue cheese encrusted beef tenderloin with fingerling potatoes, prosciutto-wrapped asparagus and tomato-bacon-onion marmalade ($29). Both entrees were cooked to perfection and portioned appropriately. There was an incredibly large amount of marmalade with my steak, which was unnecessary considering how delicious the steak tasted. It simply melted in my mouth. Dinner wasn't complete without trying dessert! Along with two espresso martinis ($9) we were captivated by the deep fried banana split ($6). The combination of fried bananas, coconut ice cream, pineapple, caramel, and macadamia nuts sounded too good to be true! It was both decadent and light; a delicious ending to a new, romantic and memorable dining experience.   Overall, we were very pleased with our dinner at Sarita. The service was on point and the food was enjoyable. Congratulations to the entire Sarita team! We are excited to return again and again and again."}
{"text":"We go almost every Monday for service industry nights, half off food! Even without the discount the happy hour at the bar is great and goes until 9. The seasonal menu never disappoints and Greg the bartender is always crafting amazing cocktails to compliment their extensive wine list. There's a municipal parking lot on the same lot along with street parking."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour: the flatbread and wine we had were reasonably priced and very tasty. Great to find a spot with high quality wines at reasonable prices. Service was impeccable: our waiter was attentive, but also was attuned to the tone of our conversation and found appropriate times to interrupt. Sad to lose Players, but will definitely return to Sarita!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but the drinks are outrageously priced.  $12 for an absolute cosmo!  It took awhile to get waited on but the service was good once it came."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience. The menu is unique without being bizarre. Our group has the ahi tuna, scallops, hot chicken and mac and cheese. All were outstanding. You could eat here every night of the week and not be bored."}
{"text":"Very good. Nice interior, nice staffs, nice presentation. Taste is also wonderful. But serving is a little bit slowly."}
{"text":"The food was definitely really good, but I went with a friend for the happy hour special and it was still a little pricy for the amount of food we got. The Sarita signature cocktail is delicious and so are the oysters!   Not at all the place to go for cheap drinks, mid shelf liquor drinks were close to $10 per drink for mixed drinks!  The staff was very friendly and attentive. Overall a very good experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"Service was perfect, and everything from appetizer to entree was delicious. The best feature of this place, IMO, is the diversity of the menu -- multiple kinds of fish, beef, poultry, wild boar (!), etc. You will definitely be able to find something you like and it will most likely be delicious. Entrees are pricey ($25-35), but they do have lots of small plate appetizers and pizzas if you don't want to break the bank. 4 stars because I have only been once, so can't attest to consistency over multiple visits."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night and it was busy to be expected. The service was so slow! We got there at 7:30 and didn't leave the restaurant until 1015! Our server did not check on us once to see how our food was. The food was just mediocre in my opinion. Maybe I will give it a second try on a weeknight when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"Went for a fundraiser for Charlie foundation and wow, found a new favorite restaurant! Everything cooked perfectly, wonderful blending of flavors and damn, those short ribs!!!! The staff was so friendly and attentive, that alone will bring me back! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time and we love it!!! Amazing food, fun atmosphere, and top notch service. Jacob was our server and he was amazing! He had great recommendations, and thoughtful wine pairings. We had a wonderful experience, and will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot with fantastic food and a nice atmosphere. Love the patio in the warm weather."}
{"text":"We LOVE Sarita. Their food is spectacular and reasonably priced - and the dishes are large portions, we always end up with leftovers! Their patio is also my favorite in Cleveland and the service is outstanding - the servers are always very knowledgeable about the food. The lobster gnocchi is out of this world and the cavatelli and meatballs is some of the best I've ever had! I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for great food, great service, and great atmosphere! Sit on the patio if you're there in the summer - and make sure to get the coffee and donuts for dessert!"}
{"text":"From the appetizers through the main corse, everything was great.  On top of that, our server Jerry did a wonderful job.  We will be back, MANY times!!!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by Sarita. I unknowingly made a reservation during restaurant week, and maybe that explains my negative experience. My friend and I both ordered the fish special. Neither the presentation nor the flavor were much to write home about; in fact, I have made better at home. Aside from the food, the acoustics in the place are awful, making it uncharacteristically loud. The one redeeming part of my experience was the drink I had at the bar before dinner, \"the sarita\" was pretty good and the bartender was friendly. I have heard that they have a good happy hour here, and I plan to check that out. I have not entirely given up on Sarita for dinner either, but 2 strikes will do it."}
{"text":"I'm giving our experience one star and the only reason is because my fiancé and did enjoy the main course. We booked a reservation and were very excited to try out this restaurant for the first time. Hoping that this would be a good place for our rehearsal dinner next year. Unfortunately the venue is terrible if you want to have any kind of a conversation at all. It's so incredibly loud in the restaurant I literally am typing this the next morning and my ears are still ringing like I went to a concert. We even sat at a small table and were close to each other, still could only here every other word. Huge disappointment, we will never go here again and I certainly would not recommend this place for any reason at all. Oh and one more thing the lobster nacho's were literally a pile of black beans on chips, the lobster failed to join the dish. Please take my review to heart I'm expressing my honesty, even the waitress made these exact same comments to us and she works there. Happy Holidays all, sorry for sharing bad news but that was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Best food AND value on the west side. Before we came here, the manager at District in downtown said he loved the place. I saw the broad apps and salad menu and was worried quality might suffer. Not an issue. We had the chorizo nachos and cast iron cornbread with jalapeño butter to begin, short ribs with pineapple fried rice and wontons and the mac and cheese for the main. Everything was delicious, perfect portions and put us in our happy place. The short rib gives Fahrenheit's version (best I've ever had) a serious run for the $ quality wise and at a better value. The patio is big enough, the right amount of crowd noise, cover etc and it's elegant. Cocktails were fantastic and the service was very good. They look like they enjoy working here"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to go here for awhile, and I can happily say that I finally made it! It was part of my monthly dinner with a friend, where we go to a new place each month. We sat out on the patio, which may have been a mistake on my part since I was wearing jeans and it was 95 degrees out, but the back patio is a nice little hidden treasure for the restaurant. We each ordered a drink, and then we split the brussel sprouts and cornbread as appetizers. I ordered the shrimp gnocchi, which was delicious, but it had a little kick to it, which I was not expecting. Remember that I cannot do anything spicy, whatsoever, so a little kick to me is usually nothing to everyone else. I wish I had room for dessert at the end, but I was just too full. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I LOVE it here! This place blew my taste buds away!  I came here with the Supper Club and I would say there were about 10 of us and the service was fantastic! They gave us 2 waiters for the entire time we were there. Also, the woman who works the front of the house (I'm assuming she is the co-owner) was awesome! She came to our table every time we had a new course come out making sure everything was on point. One of the guests at my table ordered the Blue Cheese Molten Encrusted Beef Tenderloin and it came out way over-cooked and he wasn't going to complain but the Manager was over at our table right away when she noticed he did not seem happy and had them fire up a new one right away. That is excellent Management and Customer Service in my opinion!  The other fantastic part of my fantastic experience besides the amazing food was that they let us have happy hour at what I would call the \"communal table\" that sits next to the bar. Usually you only can have happy hour at the bar so I found this to be a wonderful gesture!  Now to the food...the awesome taste bud explosion! Our table mostly focused on trying all of the appetizers or what they call on their menu \"this\" and \"that\". We ordered 2 of the 3 navajo fry breads (this is a must order item), calamari, mussels, cast iron cornbread, pizettes and the special of the night for apps included a duck dish of some sort (I just remember it being to die for) a butternut squash pierogi (I think there were 4 orders of those at our table) and I saw a few salads and a few entrees. All the specials of the night we were there sounded so amazing! I have not been to a restaurant in a long time in which I wanted to order ALL the specials!!  Shout out to Chef Romano for his incredible flavors and for making Sarita a neighborhood place that I want to keep coming back to and try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I had been a bit skeptical about the \"reboot\" of Player's on Madison into this new restaurant / format...but those fears quickly dissolved after the wonderful experience my wife and I had this past weekend sitting up at the bar for a pre-theatre Happy Hour meal.  The bartenders were extremely knowledgeable about changes made to both the menu and the space, and their drink making skills made for a great start to the evening!  I ordered a class Manhattan and my wife decided to try their Flower and Fire cocktail.  My Manhattan was just right...a bit sweet and slightly bitter.  My wife's drink had subtle jalapeno hints, and she enjoyed it so much so she had two!  We love to share dishes, and their Happy Hour menu gives a ton of tasting possibilities.  We decided to order our meal in \"waves\".  The first wave consisted of goat cheese arancini balls and their crispy chicken wings.  The fried arancini dish was really superb, and what makes the dish is their briny, slightly spicy puttanesca sauce (the capers help make this dish).  The wings had some sort of soy glaze on them; they were served piping hot and crispy outside with tender meat inside....delicious!  Wave number two consisted of portobello mushroom pierogis (a special that evening, not on the Happy hour menu) and a chorizo pizzette.  The pierogis were stuffed with the mushrooms and were topped with caramelized onions and a creme fraiche sauce.  The flatbread-style pizzette had a nice little char to the crust and the other spices on-board made for a tasty and spicy bite.  Our leisurely meal was wonderful (we were never pressed to hurry along), the ambiance and music wonderful and the food top notch.  So glad we decided to return to one of our old favorites...maybe time to make this a new favorite?!?!?  Only time will tell..."}
{"text":"We had a party of 14 on Saturday night.  The experience was great.  Easy seating, great apps, dinners were really good.  Hats off to the chef.  I will tell everyone o can about Sarita and I will be back soon with my family.  Great job."}
{"text":"Everything I had here did not disappoint. The menus change seasonally so I would suggest stopping in a couple times a year to try something new. My flour-less chocolate cake was the only thing I can say something negative about. It just wasn't that good but everything else was fantastic.  A little on the pricey side and I don't recommend bringing children. The atmosphere is quiet and upscale and I know I would upset if I was tying to enjoy a nice meal with my husband and there was a screaming toddler in the corner throwing goldfish at his parents."}
{"text":"I really hate to leave 3 stars, because the food and drinks at this place have always been phenomenal. However, the place is usually a strange atmosphere because of how empty it tends to be. Furthermore, I paid $40 cash on a $23 bill. Our waiter, who was very polite, did not bring my change. He didn't even ask and I never said that it was all set. He felt entitled to give himself a $17 tip on a $23 bill."}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing transformation. Sarita is now opened!  I live in the neighborhood and the aromas are delightful!!!  I can smell the garlic and onions!  Ah,  greatness abounds.  The makeover is superb!  Sleek and stylish with black and silver.  Has an open bar that was put in that adds some ambience to the environment!"}
{"text":"Our entire experience with Sarita was nothing short of excellent. We met with Tony to see if they could accommodate a last minute wedding party of 25 and they went above and beyond. The service was great, food was fantastic, and their attention to detail was second to none. All of our guests were very pleased with their meal and overall experience. They even special ordered a certain liquor for us, that I honestly forgot that we had even asked about. We will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"I guess we had too high of expectations. The patio was beautiful although the seating was uncomfortable. The menu seemed great. The waiter was everything you would hope for. Drinks were great. The cheese spread we started with was a great start. My husband doesn't like soft cheeses, but even he liked it. Unfortunately, our main dishes fell short. I like spicy food. The boulliabaise was 5 alarm spicy. I wish the waiter would have warned me, especially since I asked his preference. It was not filling at all.  The spice was so overwhelming I could barely taste the seafood. My husband had the Kobe dry rubbed boneless ribeye. He is very picky about steak, he did not love it.  The risotto had so much onion, I am not sure how you still called it risotto.  All I can say is we are now going through Lakewood trying to find some other food to satisfy us.  I give this a 2 star because for the price, the food should have been much better."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Lakewood, great atmosphere and friendly staff. So many options that will keep us coming back!   Keep it up Sarita:)"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but the food was phenomenal. Our server was great. I had a blue cheese encrusted beef tenderloin and my girlfriend had butternut squash ravioli. Both enteees were the best meals we've had in months. We ordered the coffee gelato and donuts for dessert. Hands down, best dessert here! Jalapeño jam margarita was great, so great, I ordered three! Great meal and atmosphere for New Years Eve!"}
{"text":"We finally got over to Sarita last weekend to see if it deserved to fill the space of the dear departed Players on Madison and we were very happy to find out it actually surpassed that Lakewood institution. Now, the prices are more \"destination restaurant\" than \"neighborhood restaurant\" like Players was but the quality of the food merits the higher price point. Sitting in the rear patio, which successfully seems tucked away, we started with drinks -- Jeannene had The Sage ($9) which is gin-based with prickly pear puree (so, yes it was perfect for a summer evening outside) while I had the Gold Standard ($12) which boldly embraced the bitterness of the tequila instead of covering it up with citrus. Though not as massive as a Cheesecake Factory menu, Sarita's options are pretty extensive with snacks, small plates, and regular entrees. And then there was a whole list of specials (all the more impressive since this was a Sunday).  We decided to bypass the entrees -- I will be back for the coriander and lime crusted sea bass ($33), this I swear to the Old Gods and the New Gods -- and went for multiple smaller dishes. I appreciated the tuna crudo ($13) in that chopped up olives were used to add saltiness of the dish instead of simply using salt. Then, it was onto one of the specials, the lobster nachos ($15) and it also had multiple ingredients to it, including corn and artichoke, that all blended well. Lastly, it was the  pesto and herb chicken pizza ($18). The pesto was fresh and vibrant but not overwhelming as the cheese was nice and gooey. The crust was thick but still felt light when eating it. We will definitely be going back to further explore the menu."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, happy hour extends until 7:00. Food was flavorful, drinks delightful, service average...except... I asked what bourbon was well (and pointed at the Manhattan on the Happy Hour menu) bartender said he didn't know but he used Bulliet. Sign me up! I didn't think it was odd because another local favorite has Bulliet Manhattans for HH.  Delicious and I had two. Bartender asked if he could use same glass or if I needed a fresh one. I'm pretty easy going and was trying to be nice so had him use my old glass. He didn't even replace cherry. It was HH pricing so it was not a big deal, however, when my check came they were almost $11 each as opposed to $5 each. I inquired nicely asking if I missed happy hour somehow and bartender said no, you upgraded your drinks. I'm not petty, will not argue, tipped 20+%, but won't be back. Price wasn't a huge factor but I was blatantly mislead. I certainly would have expected a fresh glass without bartender asking at that price though...Bulliet is nice but not top shelf. It certainly left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Perfect for a Valentine's Day dinner date. There wasn't a crumb left on our plates. We basically tried it all -- lobster nachos, calamari, cornbread, beef tenderloin, crab cakes, and crime brûlée. And the specialty cocktails. I cannot wait to return and especially try out the happy hour specials. Hands down some of the best food in the Lakewood area."}
{"text":"I've never had fry bread before so I wanted to try it.  I don't know if it is usual to have grease ooze out when you bite it or if it was made wrong; like how sometimes you get good crispy fries and others times you can get soggy greasy gross fries.  But all that grease in a bite made my stomach sour.  I'm still giving this place 3 stars since the other people I came with liked their food (expect the tomato bisque that tasted like spaghetti sauce), the patio is very nice, and the ambiance was great that night because we sat next to a small wedding reception and the bride looked awesome in her white halter top pant suit- but that's a whole separate story."}
{"text":"Started with a happy hour drink at the bar. Delightful though sweet. I had the misty which had prosecco and blood orange. The hostess had a lovely way about her and was quick to greet folks with a smile and willingness to help which is always the way you want to start and end a wonderful evening. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. We shared the fry bread, the Sarita salad, crab cakes (I don't like mine breaded and fried, but these were good anyway), and the scallop dinner special which was served with crab and watercress and quite excellent. We ended out meal with a cappuccino and fried banana split. A nice gentleman was on the floor keeping things in order and was also very engaging. An overall wonderful food and dining experience. I look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Saturdays experience was wonderful, dropped in with no reservation but they found us a table in a packed restaurant and we were glad they did.  Wonderful meal with great service, will return soon"}
{"text":"Nice chill romantic place, not your average happy hour, 5-9 Sunday through Thursday and 5-7 Friday and Saturday with a wide selection of apps and drinks. I'm a sucker for a roast pork loin and theirs is amazing, chorizo stuffed banana peppers had just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been here a few times and the food is always really good but I went tonight and got creme brûlée and it literally tastes like raspberry yogurt. They told us it was raspberry so I assumed it would have some actually raspberries on it but no. Literally raspberry yogurt. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a lovely pork tenderloin with peach salsa, grits and fried shallots. My only issue with the dish is that the salsa was served on top of the grits. It looks beautiful but completely hides the flavor of the thick cut creamy grits. The meat was very tender and delicious. It would be nice to have a little spice in the salsa but overall a very good meal. For dessert I had the Sarita salad (I had ice cream for lunch). It was very nice. I really liked the fact that the\"candied\" walnuts were not heavily crusted in sugar. Greg my bartender was attentive without being solicitous, which I really appreciate. It was a very good experience except the very loud woman behind me, that sadly has no resolve except patience. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"There are only a few vegetarian options in the menu we we enjoyed them. They include the fry bread, the cornbread, the Beemster and date salad and the fusilli gratin. Overall however the menu is very scattered. The noise level is loud, at least in the front room."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend tonight to see how the place was. Previously my girlfriend had written the place off her list but said she would try it again since the last time she was there was when it first opened. Both our dishes were great. The grouper dish was amazing. The service was amazing as well, they did a great job. The prices were not competitive.   It was 40% off wine night and either we had a $26 bottle of wine with a $15 salad and two $40 entrees or they didn't take the 40% off and we had  a $44 bottle with a $15 dollar salad and two $30 dollar entrees. $30 would be fine for each entree, it was that good. But if that's the case then they screwed up on the wine. If they didn't then the estimated $40 entrees are laughable assuming the salad was $15.  Regardless, I probably won't go back if I am spending that much money because there are better places in the area that are typically cheaper. Their service was the best part of our night. Either they need to up their food game or lower the prices, preferably the latter. Lakewood ain't that big"}
{"text":"When the chef is also the owner I'm usually impressed and Sarita is no different. I probably had the greatest steak I've ever eaten here and have been back twice since then. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"So excited to try Sarita and found it improved upon one of my favorite former restaurants. But this is not the former restaurant so I won't mention it again except to say if you liked it, you'll love this.  The decor is updated in a cute but classy tabletop theme. Fork and spoon chandelier and saucers on the wall as art. Crisp and clean lines, uber modern but warm and inviting. All the class but without being pretentious.  Food was amazingly good. My favorite was a mole pork pizette. The pork was super tender and flavorful. I had not one, not two, but three cocktails. (Rough week, maybe?) I had the Sarita, a lime and pear concoction, a Momo Margarita, which was a refreshing twist on the tequila drink, and...I don't remember my third. Which means they were really good. ;)  Excited to see the evolution of Clevelands newest eatery."}
{"text":"The best meal i have had in a long time. Service was fantastic. Drinks were made well. Food was fresh and well prepared. Loved it."}
{"text":"Finally made our way to Sarite for a midweek dinner last week and we were very happy with our meal. As stated in other reviews Sarita is located in the old Lakewood favorite spot Players on Madison. The dinning room is freshen up from the Players days but still maintains the familiar vibe.   Moving away from nostalgia and to current days Sarita's has a nice diverse selection of apps, salad, meals and pizza. We started with oysters on a the half shell, Blue Points were the bivalve of the day. A dozen at $22 was reasonably, the plating was a bit different than normal but really worked well for sharing. My better half went with the menu selection of bouillabaisse while I had the daily special of gnocchi with a lobster sauce. Both meals were well executed and nice portion sized and we agreed that we would have no problem having these dishes again.   Our server was prompt, courteous and able to answer all of our menu questions. The bar did a great job on my mixed drink orders. Prices were reasonable for the quality, just note this is not a cheap date place but a nice sit down restaurant. Sarita has harnessed the old Players feel and quality with a respectful new spin."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Members of our party had chicken, pork and steak and all were satisfied with their meal.  Waiter was great!"}
{"text":"Just left this place now. Came here for happy hour and it was amazing!!! I mean A-MA-ZING!! Drinks so good and not over powering but still feel the kick (if you know what mean). We sat at the bar and we where basically the only people there, which we liked...I know what you guys are thinking but it is only Tuesday peeps!! We enjoyed Michael our bartender/ waiter and he did great with recommendations being our first time and all. We did feel undressed with other patrons being presentable and all but know this...staff didn't make us less of a customer! We are planning our next trip back (hopefully Friday)!!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and great tasting food, but very small appetizer portions.  Priced a bit high, we were surprised at the size of the soup (large bowl, but only 1/2\" deep) and the lobster nachos seemed to be in halves taco shells, with a very light crumbling of lobster under a lot of cheese & sour cream swirls. For $16, it might be a little overpriced. The rosemary fries were delicious as were the Brussels sprouts.  Our server had a lot to tell us about multiple apps, entries and drink specials, even though there was already an extensive menu. Got a little confusing.  Anyway, we loved the decor and the food was tastey, just small portions."}
{"text":"Amazingly impressed with this place. Our server, Carl, was attentive, responsive and friendly. He seemed like a happy guy. The menu looked delicious but then we were informed of the specials. How to decide?! This was truly a complete and total culinary experience. The many flavors were subtle but distinct as they exploded on my tongue.  I can't get back soon enough! My only disappointment was the packaged sugar with the cappuccino. Suggestion...white and brown sugar cubes are a nice touch."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour in the bar. Several regular menu items at special happy hour prices.   Service has always been very attentive and good. Always lots of specials. Even on Monday's and nights when you might not expect to find any special at all.    Interesting food. Haven't ever ordered a special that sounded good that I was disappointed with. The beet salad is a regular go to. Also the Nonas Meat balls."}
{"text":"A worthy, modern successor to Players. More open space, many of the same excellent floor and kitchen staff, but still grounded and reasonable in the most West Side sense -- no outrageous prices, no too-out-there cuisine experimentation, neither too noisy nor too dead. One week since opening, and the dominant odor here is success."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan!!  Visited Sarita for the first time on yesterday, arrived just shortly after opening, and, shortly thereafter the restaurant started to fill up fast, and this was a Tuesday evening.  I met a friend there for Happy Hour and was not at all disappointed.  We were immediately seated and approached by a server, who was very attentive and offered to answer any questions.  The Happy Hour menu had lots of choices at great prices.  We settled on Nonna's meatballs, Jamaican jerk chicken wings, Cherokee fry bread, and Chippewa fry bread. We also ordered drinks from the same menu.....Fountains Flow (a tequila based version of a Moscow Mule....yum!!) and The Rain (a bourbon based sweet tea lemonade).  Our food arrived a short time later.  The wings were perfectly seasoned, just spicy enough and accompanied by grilled pineapple.  The meatballs were plump and flavorful, huge portion.   The fry breads were tasty, as well, topped nicely with flavorful offerings.  Last but not least, we shared the Lemon Marscapone Cheese cake.....it was excellent, homemade graham cracker crust, lemon filling, topped with fresh berries, nice portion, as well.  This was a great visit and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I thought Sarita was OK. The service was impeccable but the food and atmosphere were mediocre. I didn't hate anything, but nothing stood out to me (aside from the perogies, those were good!) The environment was open and extremely loud. Granted it was a Saturday night for dinner, but the acoustics seemed terrible. It's definitely not a cozy feeling place.   We ordered a handful of starters as our meal, so maybe that was the issue. I can't even remember what they all were because nothing tickled my tastebuds. I probably won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic bar and extremely well made cocktails. Had two apps the banana peppers and the lobster nachos , both were great. For dinner a tuna special that was shockingly good for Cleveland. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is Players on Madison re-invented. They totally remodeled and its very nice  The atmosphere was very much like you would find downtown.     The revamped menu has many items I want to try.  Got side tracked by the Special last night.  Crab cakes over a bacon and corn risotto.  Very tasty!!!  Overall the service was good"}
{"text":"I so would have rated Sarita 5 stars. But then I went back a second time.  So, my first visit was for girls night on a Thursday. It was extremely dead so we were well tended to. Thursday nights you can get wine for 40% off the bottle - that perk is fabulous.   We split some fries and a Nonna's meatball. It's a shame to say but the meatball was cold inside.   We had fun and no one rushed us out or looked at us weird. The bartender was sweet and attentive. We didn't have any issues and since it was such a success I mentioned to my boyfriend that we ought to go there for a Friday date night sometime soon.  I talked it up too much and I think that's where it all went wrong.  Friday night it was so packed. We sat on the patio which is lovely. The food was fantastic. (Nothing was cold this time.)   But, the service... This waitress cared about every other table but us. We must have shown up with invisible cloaks on. The entire evening, from drink orders all the way to the end when we were ready to get the CC back from the check. I've never had it that bad. It was easily a 2 1/2 hour meal because of her lack of effort. We had plans to watch a concert directly after, and clearly showed up late. She inconvenienced us.  This put a bad taste in our mouths. My boyfriend said he'll never go back again unless we sit at the bar for happy hour. If we go back, I'll update this review."}
{"text":"I've been to Sarita a few times but have somehow never dropped a review. Sarita is one of the more upscale and intimate restaurants in Lakewood, but you can typically get a table or a space at the bar without a reservation on a weeknight. Happy hour is served until 9pm but only at the bar or chefs table. The decor is modern with a distinct updated feel of so many old buildings in the Lakewood area.  The last occasion we dined at Sarita we popped in on a Tuesday night to enjoy the extended happy hour. Sitting at the chefs table we ordered several shareable dishes from the bar menu: BBQ pork pizzette, fries, wings, and the margherita pizette. If I'm being honest, all the food was B-. It was good enough but none of these dishes blew me away with flavor or originality. Also our food was not very hot. As I said before, I've eaten here several times and can remember enjoying my dinner here more in the past. I'm going to chalk this up to them having an off day. Our server was very friendly; an older gentleman who has really mastered small talk (a skill I appreciate in others since I struggle with it myself). He made us feel so relaxed with his casual, friendly approach. With that being said, our drinks and food took a little longer than appreciated, especially since we were so close to the bar.  We capped off the evening with desert. In my opinion, this is were Sarita shines! Several different options on the desert menu, and many of them are seasonal. We decided on the \"coffee and donuts\" which turned out to be local coffee flavored gelato & a pile of mini house made donut holes (appropriately hot this time) sprinkled in cinnamon sugar. This desert was simple but delicious & easily my favorite part of this dining experience."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful and welcoming. Funniest thing is my husband asked me where the bathroom was I told him I only saw the ladies. Truth is it's a unisex restroom .we laughed a while at that after we figured that out. Beer selection is great and the bar tender is awesome.i definitely recommend the  lobster nachos. Plenty of lobster and fresh jalapenos lived on top. Our server Halle was really nice and attentive. My main course was the scallops. I love scallops they were slightly salty  but the risotto was a balanced. For desert the donuts were piping hot and fresh with either coconut or coffee ice cream perfect pairing"}
{"text":"Loved everything about it. Great atmosphere, awesome wine selection and amazing food without being too pretentious. I had the goat cheese mushroom ravioli and it was to die for! Will be back again."}
{"text":"Server was great but other than that we were just bummed about the food and drink. My Manhattan was watery and the one I sent back was replaced by what I could've swore was the same drink with a splash of whiskey added. The yellow fin tuna was so poorly described we were surprised that it was a salad and might as well been starkist out of a can. When the prosciutto and smoked mozzarella came out you could tell that it was grilled and the cheese had melted but then sat in the window for so long the mozzarella had hardened again, covered in the greasy sheen of half dead cheese. Half an hour after we were done with the apps our entrées showed up (we ordered apps and entrées at the same time). My $30 dollar medium rare steak was well done and my fingerling potatoes were reminiscent of a Wendy's baked potato at closing time. You'd think at this point management would come try to save face but no luck.   This is not an exaggeration nor am I spiteful for them killing our date night. I just feel If you work hard for your money and you want a night out to be special (and worth it) I'd suggest going someplace else. I hope they iron out the kinks and prosper in the future."}
{"text":"Great place for intimate dinners romantic dinners great atmosphere clean the waiters and waitresses are awesome the bartender is great the food was phenomenal"}
{"text":"I went to Sarita last night for dinner with one of my friends. We have been looking forward to trying this place for a while, and I am glad we did. We each started out with a drink, I got the Sarita Cocktail. We split the brussel sprouts and cornbread as an appetizer and I got the crab cakes as an entree. The cocktail was very good, but very strong. I was also surprised this was not at the happy hour price because we were there at 5:30. The brussel sprouts were amazing. I have never been a fan of brussel sprouts, but these were the best ones I've ever had. The cornbread and crabcakes were pretty good, but I've had better. I enjoyed the presentation of all of the food thought, lots of thought went into it.   I also enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. We sat outside which was quiet and had a nice little pond. The inside was also decorated modern and nice. I will have this on my list to go back to again."}
{"text":"Amazing Caesar, not drowning in dressing. Had the short ribs, wonderfully tender and succulent. The veggies were amazing too. The coffee and donuts might be my new favorite dessert"}
{"text":"Could be 5 star if the wine list was better.  For such an upscale foodie place, the wine list is pretty pathetic....all very cheap and not good wines at all.  Go here for the food, but don't expect any good wines."}
{"text":"An unworthy successor to Players.  The selection is narrower, the prices are higher and portions skimpier.  The salmon was over cooked.  The \"Lobster Nachos\" had virtually no lobster!  Sarita: Please get your act together."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the hype here. I was not impressed, as many of my fellow reviewers seem to be. I arrived around the last hour of happy hour, which has awesome hours btw. It went till 9 pm on the Monday night that I went.  The service was prompt and courteous. No gripes there.  First, the good - My mom loved her miso salmon. It was cooked well and tasty. They were also cool about subbing a veggie for rice. My drink, the Sarita cocktail, was also on point. Fried green tomatoes were fine too.   The meh - my wings were soggy. I ate one and packed them for home bc I wanna try to improve them at home. I was also super disappointed by the frybread. Having had the real thing, as prepared by several different times with unique variations, I was disappointed that the quality. It was like the more expensive, less tasty version of Taco Bell's chalupa. Frybread is supposed to be browned and sorta crunchy on the outside and doughy in the middle. Typically, it's like this: http://andcute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Navajo-Fry-Bread-Recipe.jpg. The chicken atop the fry bread was well-seasoned and tender, though.  Overall, it was an OK experience but I'm definitely not pleased with the cost versus the product."}
{"text":"Happened to stop in randomly on a Saturday night. Very busy, staff was nice. A little pricey but the food was very good.   I had the lobster pizza! Excellent"}
{"text":"I debated on 1, 2 or 3 stars for awhile, but I had to choose 1.   However, let me explain. it was a Tuesday and I had made reservations a couple weeks prior for 6 people at 5 o'clock when they opened.  We had never been here before and we were celebrating 2 birthday's.  We were sat at a table by the front window on the bar side.  We were still waiting for 2 of our guests and we had read about their happy hour and wanted to participate in that as well if we could.  We asked the server if we needed to move closer to the bar to participate and he pointed out that we had to sit at the bar or the communal table with all the high top chairs.  We would have happily taken the communal table but our one older guest that was still on his way would not be able to hop up and sit in those chairs.  We explained that he is handicap.  He can barely walk far without taking breaks and recently fell and had broken ribs and even lifting his leg for a step is hard.  So he seemed very understanding, however he said he had to ask.  So he went to the bar and then came back to inform us that he was very sorry but that they would not allow us to participate in happy hour unless we sat at the high top and that they had to stick by their rules.  And so because you felt that your happy hour rules were more important then including a family with a disabled person, I had to stick to my rules and gave you 1 Star.  Our server was fantastic by the way."}
{"text":"This place was exceptional. Our waitress was extremely attentive, had wonderful suggestions and helped us as first timers make great selections. The food was very good, the atmosphere was quiet and intimate. My girlfriend and I had an awesone time and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a few Sarita martinis, very strong and delicious. Also had the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella Very very good I thought about getting a second. Brussels were amazing, perfect combo of salt and sweet. Mussels were mediocre."}
{"text":"This is going to be my new go to spot for cocktails after work.  Sarita has an excellent happy hour.  It's so refreshing to find a spot that has a happy hour that goes longer than 6 PM.  For those who work until 6 PM, it is a blessing! Sun-Thurs 5 -9 PM; Fri & Sat 5-7 PM.  The selection has a nice variety of appetizers and cocktails.  I ordered the \"Sarita\" \"Message Man\" and \"Annunciation\" all three were delicious, each one different from each other.  The Sarita reminds me of an updated Cosmopolitan, instead of cranberry juice they add Prickly Pear Juice.  This is definitely a cocktail you drink with your girls for a ladies night.  The award for most interesting cocktail goes to Message Man-if you are a fan of beets you will love this, it's made from roasted beet infused gin and it was surprisingly delicious. Annunciation was my least favorite because it seemed a little bland compared to the others- even with the blueberry puree, however it was strong =) The specialty cocktails are all $7.  They also offer $6.50 glasses of wine, $2.50 Coors Light and $4 beers.  The $9 Butternut Squash Pizette was my most favorite thing at Sarita.  The squash, prosciutto and sage flavors worked very nicely together.  I also ordered Nonna''s Meatballs because I heard they were a must.  They were really good, my only complaint was that I wanted to eat them with spaghetti noodles because they were a little salty, but the flavor was on point.   The staff was inviting,not pretentious at all-there was a nice gentleman that greeted us and even found us seats at the bar by asking one of the patrons nicely if they could move down one.  I hate being that person that makes a person move their seat...so awkward! One thing to note, you can take advantage of the happy hour if you don't sit at the bar, there was another table near the bar that was communal style, it has a beautiful cutlery chandelier right above it.  Definitely coming back here for more happy hours and perhaps a special occasion dinner."}
{"text":"We were 45 minutes early for our reservations and treated with a warm hello and taken straight to a table. Server always had a friendly smile and was quick to suggest favorites, not that it helped because everything looked so great on the menu... My favorite problem to have. We got the flat bread and corn bread and both were amazing. I enjoyed the flat bread more, just because I love pesto. There were four of use and between us we had crab cakes, I didn't try these but heard they were yummy. the Mac and cheese was decadent and purely sinful. I had the pork chop which was perfect, had a sweet glaze was crispy outside and juicy inside with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans, nothing was left on the plate. My husband had the short ribs which were eye closingly good. The drinks were perfect and for dessert had the brownie sandwich, a must have. I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!   Very classy place with upscale decor. We chose to sit on the patio since it was such a beautiful night. Our dinner dates were regulars there so the waitstaff was very friendly. We started with the special of lobster nachos and the pierogies. Both were delicious! My only concern was the large slices of fresh jalapeno on the nachos were overwhelming. I popped a whole one in my mouth and it annihilated my palate for a good 10 mins. I love jalapenos, but when they are served in a slice like that you assume you can put the whole thing in your mouth.   For my entree I got the sea bass and it was excellent! It was cooked beautifully and every component on the place paired very well together. They make a great martini and their wine list is lovely."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 5 stars if it wasn't for how crowded and noisy it was on a Saturday night. My husband and I had to wedge ourselves into our seats, zero room to pull out our chairs, then it got so loud, we stopped conversing.  I felt sorry for the servers who had to navigate narrow passages with heavy trays over their heads. The ambience got a zero in our book.   However, the food and menu got 5 stars. There wasn't a single thing on the menu I didn't want to try. We both had jerky specials that were outstanding. Service was  good considering the environment.  We will strategically return on a day when it's less busy, but why can't they deliver in all fronts?"}
{"text":"Three stars is a bit harsh since everyone at our table enjoyed the food quite a bit. I'm dinging them on harried and sloppy service and a paltry bottled beer selection, which was made worse on our visit due to some options being 86ed. The service issues meant that drink orders were delayed, food came out at odd intervals and water glasses were left unfilled. That's too bad because the food was great, but a $100+ tab for two should be a great experience overall. I'll definitely give it another shot, and I hope things are ironed out next time."}
{"text":"If you want a modern, fresh yet comforting experience with amazing food, you've come to the right place. Perfect for a date night, happy hour, or friends get together, every dish at Sarita is prepared beautifully. The espresso crusted Bison strip and pork belly app are phenomenal. Their cocktails are also strong and tasty. Overall, this this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times, but ordered thru Uber Eats at least a dozen times. The cornbread is amazing and even the blue cheese tenderloin after delivery knocks my socks off. Great job!!"}
{"text":"In Lakewood last evening for somber reasons (calling hours for a young man), we decided to search Yelp for a place nearby for dinner, found Sarita, made a reservation, drove over, and walked in.  We were greeted promptly and warmly, and led to a table right next to the kitchen - noise from the kitchen was not a problem, but the general atmosphere is fairly noisy, and one particular diner two tables away from us was VERY loud throughout the meal (restaurants can't pick their patrons, though, so I simply counted this as free entertainment provided by someone who seems to have few private thoughts).  Our server was brilliant, telling us in detail about the numerous specials (all of which sounded scrumptious), and offering not only to answer questions, but to repeat any of the information, and then gave us a few minutes to ponder those and the regular menu items.  He returned in good time, took our orders, brought us beverages and bread with butter.  The cornbread was HOTHOTHOT (the server cautioned us appropriately) and delicious, served with jalapeno butter (I want another skillet of that right now as I type this, and I make seriously good cornbread myself).  That and a bowl of hot soup would have been perfect (making a note for next time).  My chicken francais was flavorful (mmm, capers), with just enough sauce, and the greens atop the chicken were fresh, with tomatoes, and thinly sliced fennel included.  The risotto, though, was extremely salty;  I tried another bite, and just couldn't handle it, so I left it.  We shared a pumpkin crème brulee for dessert.  The flavor was fine, the texture was thick, and it was heavy - we would not order this again.  Note:  The restroom (there seems to be only one) is ginormous;  one could take a friend along - it is a one-seater with no stall or partition, though, so make sure it's a good friend."}
{"text":"I just discovered the free CLEseats app so I tried Sarita. We were able to save 20% off the entire bill including drinks!!! I had the potato wrapped Mahi. It was amazing. I definitely will come back. It is a little pricey but was a great deal when I used the CLEseats discount. They have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! Started with the arancini which was solid, had a bit of spice to it which was a surprise, could have done with an extra minute or so in the fryer.  Ancho Pork was BoME, smoky and sweet with a great corn and bacon relish type thing underneath served with what really should be called shoestring potatoes. BF had the hot chicken which had some spice but not much flavor. The mashed potatoes were good though. Cornbread as awesome, I suggest basting the top of it with the butter as it melts so the whole thing is drenched in the honey goodness. FOR DESSERT, the chocolate torte was so decadent and sweet, a must have!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Don't miss the Navajo fry bread appetizer. This restaurant is a gem."}
{"text":"The best happy hour... goes till 9 Sunday-Thursday at the bar. It is a steal. We had the butternut squash pizzette and it was a great flavor and They have walnuts on it for some chrunch. The meatballs... amazing sauce. And lots of yummy drinks"}
{"text":"Great staff! Great decor!   Food, the Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer was FANTASTIC! The  Navajo  bread with the tomato something or other was to die for! Entrees, Cavatelli was a bit over done (mushy) a little kick to the sauce, but was a solid 7 out of 10. Pricing was a bit high for pasta!  The pork tenderloin was AMAZING! Pricing, worth it!   The cocktails, STRONG!  We will come back but probably will pass on the pasta!"}
{"text":"I have been to sarita twice before, both times everything was DELICIOUS! Great service, great food, great atmosphere! One of my faves!"}
{"text":"Saritas is my new favorite spot in Lakewood. They have great appetizers (the jerk chicken wings are my favorite). They also have amazing cocktails. They change out their menu periodically - was disappointed they took the blueberry mule off the drink menu, but I found another great cocktail the purple haze :-) The servers are tentative and friendly. Great atmosphere and all around a great dinner spot."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food, a lot. However service is incredibly slow, and usually too loud. Also, while the food is good, it's a bit pricey. My main reason for giving this 3/5 stars is because dinner ends up being almost 3 hours. I've been there twice, a year spread out and had the same waiter. When he's attentive, he's great. However, they just seem to be short on help. Waited probably 30 minutes for bread and water alone."}
{"text":"Tried Sarita for the first time last night. Went for the happy hour 5-7 p.m. daily and truly enjoyed this place.  Sat at the bar with my wife and Jen (bartender) was very helpful.  Tried the mussels (big portion) and the fry bread which was so good!   The updates they have done since opening are really nice and we will be back."}
{"text":"Come here 1st to celebrate my cousins birthday and everything was amazing. From the moment we walked in with the decorations up to the food. So fresh and big portions. We had the calamari and it was very good and the fresh gnocchi with lobster in Ohio corn. It was so delicious. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Some dishes are great, others are good/average. Atmosphere is nice, a little more upscale then most spots on Madison, more of a downtown feel. I felt the short rib should have been a little more tender but the grits that accompanied it were delicious. Hot chicken was a good! Not too hot but still has some kick and the cornbread side was amazing. The calamari was good not great, enjoyed the various sauces. The Mac and cheese is very rich but worth it. A perfect spot for a date night or smaller party."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, a few months apart, and had a good experience both times. The first time I got to enjoy an empty, quiet and comfortable patio. Most recently I found myself in a bustling dining room with a full bar nearby.   There were numerous specials available falling into both the starter / salad and entree categories. I tried one of the salad specials which was very good. It came with sliced fruit and candied nuts.   For my main I tried the pork tenderloin. It had a wonderfully flavorful salsa on top it: roasted corn, bacon, and tomato ragout. The pork itself was tender and perfectly cooked - not overly well done.   For dessert there was Luxardo goat cheese ice cream. Yes Luxardo. That's the most amazing brand of cherries...the kind that go in Manhattans. My only complaint is that there weren't more of them in the ice cream. Really the ice cream tasted vanilla, with just isolated cherries in it. This was served with an apple tart which was soft and very good.   There is a large menu offered so really everyone should be able to find something that works for their tastes.   Service was efficient both at the table and the bar where I stopped for a pre-dinner drink."}
{"text":"Went in this evening because we were looking for something different from our normal routine.  Sarita offers service industry night on mondays! 50% off all food for industry folk! Service was absolutely wonderful! Our bartender/server was very delightful and attentive. The atmosphere was dark and modern but very inviting. Cavs game was on the TV for those interested in watching... Overall absolutely satisfied! They have gained a couple of regulars! Spectacular Monday evening out! Thank you so much to Sarita and staff but especially our server!"}
{"text":"Let me say to begin, there is nothing terribly wrong with this place. It's just, well odd. There were so many elements of Sarita A Restaurant that rubbed me the wrong way that it doesn't make my We Are Definitely Going Back There list.  First, the name. Really? A restaurant? A little too cutesy for me.  Second, the menu. It's divided into This, That, and The Other. Again, way too cutesy. Third, the atmosphere. We literally sat at our table and laughed about what a bizarre mix of elements they had going on. While my verdict was that this place was like if Abercrombie and the Apple Store's lovechild, my boyfriend felt like he was eating in a hair salon. Everything is black and white and they were playing techno dance music. I also couldn't tell if I was under dressed or not. I felt like if I had worn a black turtleneck a la Steve Jobs I would have fit in better. Fourth, our waiter. A little awkward. He definitely did not want to be there and seemed to have never witnessed an interaction between waiter and waitee before. It's possible he was a robot or an alien. Fifth, the price. Don't get me wrong, the food was great! We started with the Navajo Fry Bread which was scrumptious. I had the crab cakes, double scrumptious. It's a bit more than I like to pay, personally and given the above, not worth it IMO.  Deets: there are two main seating areas, one with the bar and high tops with low tables towards the front. There's a step down into a larger seating area with low tops. A wheelchair should be able to handle it with some help. Looked like they have a patio out back.  Parking is in an adjacent lot and on the street. Metered parking in Lakewood is free after 6 and on weekends."}
{"text":"Good service.   Sausage pizza was excellent: great crust and the sausage, spinach and peaches sounded odd but combined really well.   Patio was closed due to the heat and earlier rain but they found us a quieter table near the bar.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Went for their Wine Dinner in December.  The food was more than delicious and the wine delightful.  Service was excellent.  Took food home since they served so much.  Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good here. I have always had a great meal. Service is efficient and professional. You can't go wrong with any of their creative and delicious appetizers or entrees. This is definitely a place to try something different.   The reason for four stars instead of five is because I think it would be nicer if there were less tables on the patio. It is a very move patio but overcrowded with tables"}
{"text":"Pleased with experience! Great food, great service. Went with two of my friends and we all enjoyed our meals. It's really nice to go somewhere where the server is attentive and knowledgeable regarding the entire menu and can explain every ingredient.  Well done, Sarita. We'll be back."}
{"text":"(Note to management: your website still says you close at 10 PM on Sundays...please update it to avoid further broken hearts!)  Came here on Saturday night for dinner. It took us a while to make a decision on our food because so many items sounded delicious...and THEN the server shared the specials and we changed our minds entirely.  We ended up ordering ALL specials, including:  - Burrata (appetizer) - Lobster gnocchi - Swordfish with risotto - Chocolate cake  Every dish was phenomenal. And the wine was great, too. It was such a delightful meal with a lovely atmosphere, we tried to go back the next night, too. Unfortunately we showed up a little too late after the kitchen closed and weren't able to enjoy a second meal.  I'm not sure when we will return to Cleveland, but when we do, we will surely be back."}
