{"text":"Nice environment. Food is really bland and uneventful.  Service was prompt even during busy time (Sunday morning ). $30 for 2 people breakfast .....overpriced for underwhelming food."}
{"text":"Nice place - fast, friendly staff (including the owner/cook who comes out to say hello when the orders are done).  Prices are very reasonable, food is good to very good, but not gourmet - it's a diner, and its best offerings are diner food (burgers, fries, breakfast, comfort food).  They do some unusual things which have been surprisingly good (\"does that say clam AND corn chowder or is that two different chowders?\").  

They've had some growing pains, but I'm willing to overlook those for now.  Having cooked breakfast in a diner when I was in college, I know that cooking eggs properly for a bunch of customers all wanting different methods is a challenge.  I don't even want to think about all of the undercooked or overcooked eggs I sent out...ugh."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here so much, myself and a friend of mine have become regulars!  You know it's serious when the owner and the whole staff knows you by name!  The owner is a great guy, especially if you want to talk cars or food!  The food is excellent for a diner, and the prices are extremely fair, especially when you consider the \"ritziness\" of the Hudson area.  Cabbage rolls are excellent, the reuben is a great choice, and the burgers are better than any other place in Hudson.  Breakfast is delicious, and the coffee is always hot and good.  What else could you want?"}
{"text":"Solid diner!
Best Philly Cheese steak sandwich I've had in a long time. Have them add jalape√±os if you like it spicy.
Definitely coming back to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Try the \"Big Bopper\" burger! It has BBQ sauce, bacon & onion rings; the flavors really do complement each other well. The burgers here are the least inexpensive around the Hudson area; you can get a great, flavorful burger and a good amount of fries for just $9 compared to other places around town. The burger was tasty and cooked just how I asked, and the fries were not your typical fast food style and had a good flavor to match the burger. Friendly, quick and easy service as well; I will definitely go back to have the \"Big Bopper\" again!"}
{"text":"I live in Hudson and was very excited to hear about this place. Unfortunately, it did not deliver.

My son ordered the 'chunky monkey' pancakes and they were a mess. They were delivered after a long wait and were very disappointing. The granola, bananas and whipped cream looked as if they were thrown on the plate. The center of the pancakes were a mushy mess. He was really looking forward to eating them and he barely had 2 bites.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich which was decent. Eggs, cheese and bacon on a kaiser roll.  The potatoes on the side however were awful. They were almost raw with no flavor. I like my breakfast potatoes with some crunch and some salt and/or seasoning, these had none of those qualities. 

Overall a very disappointing meal and subpar service. I hate to say this, but we won't be back. The Cafe in Stow is a much better option."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our 2 and 4 year old to lunch there today and LOVED it! Great food and great service! My husband had a corned beef and I had an East Coast sloppy joe. Great kids menu, too. I was so happy to find a place in Ohio that knows how to make a sloppy joe - when I met the owners, who are from New Jersey, I understood why!!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Though the vibe is nostalgic, and the staff friendly, I was less than impressed with my hot pastrami sandwich which was too expensive for the price."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and great owners. It is the best of the breakfast places in Hudson for a classic diner breakfast - nothing fancy just good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"What a great little 50's themed diner. Fast friendly service and great food ! Hot food cooked to order ! What a concept, the big chains could learn a lot from them ! We'll definitely be back for lunch or dinner. Breakfast was awesome ! Karen and Johnny are quite the team. Welcoming and friendly. Love the look and the music !  I can't believe we've overlooked this place for so long. We would give this place more stars if we could !"}
{"text":"Update- my third visit and I can say the breakfast was great again- eggs, bacon and home fries were spot on!   This has been the best breakfast by far since recently moving to Hudson.  They say you can tell how good a cook is by their eggs - mine were perfectly cooked again over medium- no crusty whites and done just right.  The home fries were also cooked great - no raw or over cooked potatoes with still enough crunch on thinly sliced pieces."}
{"text":"I heard about Johnnys Diner and decided to stop in to check it out.  The place was quite busy.  We were greeted in such a friendly way when we walked in.  So far, so good.  I can't help being a little critical as I have worked in the restaurant business for many years.  The server we had took our drink order, let us know the specials, explained them and made some recommendations from the menu all with a smile on her face.  I ordered The Bopper Burger with fries.  I was quite impressed.  Not only did it look good, it tasted good!  My friend ordered the meatlovers omelette.  It was filled with Taylor ham, bacon, sausage and ham.  The omelette came with home fries and toast.  It was so good, it would be great if that was always on the menu.  My other friend ordered the meatloaf platter.  Homemade meatloaf, mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  Best meatloaf I've tried in a long time.  All in all the meal was really good.  Wish we had room for the homemade apple pie or peanut butter pie.  There is not one thing I didn't like about my experience at the diner.  The service was great,  The food was great.  The place is really clean.  (big plus in my book)  Even the owner stopped out to introduce himself and thank us for stopping in.  Very impressed.  We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day for dinner. I noticed the diner a few weeks ago when I went to Chase, and I finally got around to trying it. I got the bacon burger, sadly forgetting to take a picture, and it was decent. The patty was actually a little thin, and it was definitely not done medium like I requested (more like well done). But it was still good and the fries were delicious. Service was also great. I'd love to try it again for breakfast."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I lived in north Jersey for almost half my 41 years and had an immediate selection of 5-star diners, but this diner was no where near a 5 star experience. They're really lucky I'm giving them two stars.

We decided to go there this morning, a Saturday, because we were looking for a good breakfast and willing to pay a little bit extra for it.

The place was pretty busy with older people so we were stuck in a tiny two-seater by the door. The table had a lot of clutter on it and it didn't leave much room for plates let alone anything else. 

The menu is limited, no country fried steak, no meat in the skillets that I saw (besides the corned beef hash one) and you couldn't get lunch until 11 AM. Their lunch and dinner menus are also limited.

We both got 2 eggs and bacon. It comes with home fries and a bread of your choosing. I did sunny side up and a bagel. He did sunny side up and rye. Husband got orange juice and coffee, I got iced tea. 

Food came out fairly quickly. But when the waitress set down my plate, the eggs were literally raw. They were quickly fried on the bottom but jiggly and clear on the top. I scraped off most of the raw egg white that I could and used the bottom and the cold yolk to flavor my potatoes. Nothing had salt. Even the butter on the lightly warmed bagel was plain and salt-free. There was something that looked like paprika maybe on the potatoes, but you couldn't taste it. It was horrible. I asked the husband if there happened to be jelly packets on his side of the tiny table we were forced to choose because the place was busy for a Saturday morning, but he said there wasn't anything but what I saw over there. The girl never asked if I wanted cream cheese or jelly and she never came back during the entire time we were eating for me to ask her for some.

His meal was the same. It was horribly bland and we weren't even out the door before he said we were never going back there. 

We both agreed the bacon had the most flavor, but my slices ranged from dark and crispy on one side to almost uncooked on the other side of the same piece. 

Don't waste your time or money unless you like bland, unsalted, hardly cooked food."}
{"text":"The new jersey style philly cheese steak snd the sweet potatoe fries is so good.  Yummy"}
{"text":"My wife and stopped there for breakfast this morning.  We each had coffee and we split a bacon and cheese omelet with home fries and an English muffin.  The food was good and the service was quick and very friendly.  
The chef came around to the table to make sure everything prepared to our liking.  You don't see that very much in chain restaurants.
I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of our wonderful waitress, I got the streak hoagie special. It was fantastic & the home made fries were the best. My husband had the corn beef and loved it. Great hometown dinner."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Johnny is the owner and the cook! A great guy, comes out and talks to the customers.
It's a 50's dinner with jukebox, counter and booths! The food is good and not huge portions but just right.
My favorite is the Grilled Rueben. My grandson likes to sit at the counter and have pancakes. It is very kid friendly. The waitstaff is friendly and quick. They serve a great milkshake and have a car rally every Wednesday during the summer and fall.
Don't forget to put your change in the jar when you pay! The money goes to sending a teen to Young Life camp every summer!"}
{"text":"a fan b/c its a neat little place.  If you are in a hurry go somewhere else.  If you want to hang out, talk, look around, enjoy the wait then its a great place."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Good diner food, very clean, service is very attentive. We had the pancakes and the western omelet."}
{"text":"Very friendly diner with cute 50's-60's character.  The booths were cute and comfortable (a little tight but well cushioned).  The staff were super nice, although service was extremely slow.  I ordered the South of the Border Omelette with addition of jalape√±os that comes with hash and toast (2 whole slices) - this was really tasty but greasier/butterier than other diners and did lack a bit of heat.  My husband ordered two eggs and pancakes, which was good and what you'd expect.  I am always somewhat disappointed when diners don't serve freshly squeezed juices (sorry), but I noticed they serve shakes and malts, which is pretty cool.  Overall, great, local place."}
{"text":"Three of us met here today for lunch. I ordered a delicious mushroom burger with grilled portabella mushrooms & melted mozzarella cheese for $8.99. The menu stated \"all burgers served with choice of french friend, potato chips, or coleslaw. Onion rings or sweet potato fries add $1.99\". So with the above burger, I ordered the coleslaw, and then the onion rings, which I presumed would be $1.99 more. Unfortunately, the final bill was $8.99 for the burger, $1.99 for the onion rings, and $2.25 for cole slaw. When I questioned the waitress, Alyssa, she just stated that was the way it works! It still doesn't sound right to me!"}
{"text":"I patronize this nostalgic establishment at least once a week and I can honestly say I have never ordered something I didn't like.  Their burgers are as good as some other Hudson restaurants that charge twice as much and their breakfast skillets are the best in town!  Prices are fair and service is always friendly.  Glad they are here!"}
{"text":"Tried Johnny's for breakfast this morning and I will definitely be coming back.  The ham, egg, and cheese on Kaiser was exactly what you want from a diner breakfast sandwich: thick ham, gooey cheese, well cooked egg, and buttery grilled bread; it also helps that they offer Sriacha and a few other tasty hot sauce choices. The service was good, friendly, and for a place that hasn't been open that long there weren't the hiccups that you usually associate with new restaurants."}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch here today.  I was totally impressed with their Rubin Sandwich.  The corned beef was shredded, hand carved.  Good eating..."}
{"text":"Great food and great people! We eat here once a week and I highly recommend Johnny's!"}
{"text":"Awful! Everything was bland. Portions were small for the price. \"Butter\" on husbands toast wasn't even melted, a full tablespoon of it. Even the coffee was incredibly watery and lacking in flavor. Had high hopes based on the fox 8 news segment, very disappointed. Would not come again!"}
{"text":"Would love to give the friendly staff more stars... but we have been there 4 or 5 times now and the problems are not getting better.

They do not handle busy well... sure there is free wi fi to entertain yourself... but... and hour for 2 cheese steaks? We watched as people who were seated after us were served and could hear the kitchen staff struggling to get our order and a take out order for cheese steaks straight.

There are no side options that my husband can eat... he is a cardiac patient and can not have chips... or anything fried... or eggs... he usually gets a side salad... for full price... and trying to get a chicken sandwich without chips is like pulling teeth... he gets asked at least 3 or 4 times if he \"really doesn't want any chips? they come with it\"... NO! he can not eat chips! Having full fat mayo on the sandwich is already a cheat... getting the third degree for not wanting chips is a hassle.

Be sure to walk to the back and look at the specials board... unless you are directly in front of it you can not read the chalk... not sure what is the problem... but it is totally illegible. 

1+ on the tiny 2 top tables... it is nice to have the straw holder... but there is WAY too much on each table for WAY too little space."}
{"text":"I've always liked diners for their non-chain feel and the fact that their food doesn't seem so assembly line. Johnny's was great. I got a Reuben, which was better than any Reuben I've had in over a decade - that includes local and Cleveland delis. The fries weren't really my thing, but they have other sides that I'm looking forward to trying.

The service was outstanding. The staff were really friendly, and the owner came over to say hi after my wife and I had finished our meal. You don't see that kind of thing anymore, and I really appreciated it. 

I'll definitely be back. If you haven't been before, do yourself a favor and give Johnny's a shot."}
{"text":"This place has great potential! The location is great and the place is cute but the food did not meet our expectations. The meat on my burger was obviously frozen and the fries were tasteless. On our first visit we tried the hot dog special. The hot dogs tasted like they were the cheapest money could buy. This place could be a \"Diners Drive In's and Dives  kind of place if they would kick the food up a notch. I can picture home-cut fries, fresh made onion rings and more variety of shakes (when I asked for a hot fudge peanut butter shake, I was told they did not have hot fudge or peanut butter! Later, she did inform me that she found peanut butter!) 
I have high hopes that the food will get better and Johnny's will stay around for years to come."}
{"text":"Finally stopped to give Johnny's Diner a try for breakfast, and we are glad we did.  Super friendly and attentive waitress Karen.   Food was very good and decor retro cute."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Cute atmosphere. Clean with friendly staff. Perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Had a business meeting there this morning. I had the Hudson Hash. It was excellent. Eggs over easy were done to perfection and the portion was ample size. Karen was a great server very friendly and prompt with the coffee."}
{"text":"What a cute little family owned diner ! Warm and welcoming atmosphere with excellent food and service . Being from the diner capital of the world (jersey) I'm giving this one a 10 out of 10! Will be sure to visit again ."}
{"text":"OK, been here about a dozen times. Really trying to support a local business. This is the last time we will eat here. What this place needs is MUCH better service and to stop screwing up orders. And $26 for breakfast for my Daughter and myself ? Seriously ?"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The food is great and homemade.  The staff is great and we love the atmosphere.  It's a great family place for dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner because my daughter goes to the dance studio next door. I ordered the Clevelander, a brat with sauerkraut & onions, and my wife ordered the patty melt and a milkshake. Food came out quick and everything was good."}
{"text":"If you love mom and pop restaurants, this place is perfect for you. They have great food with a very hospital staff that make you feel like family!"}
{"text":"Cute 'retro' looking diner.  Friendly staff. 
Came for breakfast once and it was ok.  I'll give them a break considering when we went they were new.  My over medium eggs were over cooked.  The waitress quickly took them back and had them remade and the 2nd time came out right.  I did not care for the potatoes, they had no taste.  The bacon was meh.  Not too impressed w/b-fast. 

Trying for 2nd time.  This time lunch.  GREAT lunch! I had the pesto chicken w/hot cherry peppers in ciabatta bread...this was delicious!  It's served w/chips.  The pesto was so good!  However, if u don't like hot spicy food, this isn't for you.  If u do like food that has heat, this sandwich provides!  Nice piece of chicken too.  Had a side of cole slaw and it was pretty good.  My hubby got the New Jersey chicken philly.  He really liked it.  I tried and it was very good too!  On a soft roll!  Also, I'm not a big fan of onion rings, but they have the best ones around!!  Dip them in a little mustard...oh yeah!  And the water here is good.  Prices good too.  Oh, and we got a slice of chocolate cake.  Waitress said made in house.  It was delicious and moist.  Kinda tasted like Betty Crocker cake and frosting, but it's all good!"}
{"text":"45 min to get our food, which was a very simple order. No offer to do anything to remedy the situation, just an explanation from the owner that they were \"busy.\" Fine, but we counted 3 tables that got served in a fraction of the time we had been waiting, and they came in after us. No one ever came to check on us in the meantime, either. We were a party of 3, not understanding what went wrong. Oh, and stale bread, just for the icing on the cake! Save yourself the trouble and get a good meal in good time at Yours Truly!"}
{"text":"Fun place to take a young family.  They have a small step 2 diner, which entertained the kids right up to when dinner was served.  Burgers were good and the fresh cut fries were fantastic.  Wednesday's are Cruising night, which adds some fun Mid-week."}
{"text":"Food was what I expected  at this type of establishment.  Very kid friendly atmosphere and menu. Burger, fries, soups, shakes and traditional American meals make up the menu."}
{"text":"David and I had a late lunch.  The food was homemade and very tasty.  

David had the corned beef sandwich on grilled rye.  The corned beef was some of the best I've had in Ohio.  It was a better sandwich than the one at Gasoline Alley in Fairlawn.

I had the daily special - Beef stew over noodles.  The beef was amazing.  It was tender and juicy.  The veggies were plentiful and cooked to perfection.  The noodles were just egg noodles (nothing to write home about).  The only thing that would have made this dish better would have been if the stew was over mashed potatoes instead of the noodles.

The prices were very reasonable.  Everyone was quite friendly.  This is going to be our new go to place for home cooked style food."}
{"text":"If this diner ever closes i will lose my mind.

Nothing i can say about this place will do it justice suffice to say when my fiance and i relocated from cleveland to hudson we had no place we really felt at home until we happened upon Johnnys Diner. The staff is great, the owner is one of the most down to earth guys i've met and a stellar cook. They serve all their items (including breakfast) all day which is great for us cause we are on a late schedule. I often times find myself ordering specials off the board because they always surprise me and never let me down. The price point is very good for the amount of food and how good it is. Its a retro style diner but they do have a flat screen up if you need to check the weather/scores/news, there's wifi. They have a jukebox and they're almost always playing some classics and if not just ask em to put something on. My fiance is crazy about their signature \"caramel, apple, bacon waffle\" which i just tried recently and is amazing to say the least. I really love when they have their homemade potato salad it's really good. I know Johns wife makes alot of homemade desserts as well. They make good old fashioned milk shakes and malts which im dying to try but everytime i go i end up to full. I could go on forever but bottomline if you're located anywhere within driving distance of downtown hudson stop by here and check them out. We did and it's the only place we go pretty much.

they have a facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JohnnysDinerinHudson"}
{"text":"The Diner has a very cold feel. The Staff seems unable to keep up and the food was very bland.
The acoustics were poor and you could hear every conversation around you. No reason to go back."}
{"text":"The service was friendly. The food came out fairly quickly. The stars are reduced for the following
1-The booth table tops look dirty and stained
2-The breakfast skillet was medium warm at best. 
3-There were a large quantity of Christian signs and sayings all over the restaurant. 

I'm not religious but I felt uncomfortable thinking about other friends of other religions who might come here.  I don't begrudge someone their religious beliefs but in a public service industry, I don't know why you'd risk alienating clientele."}
{"text":"With its Happy Days-style decor and delicious food, this dining spot is perfect for a family of picky eaters. There is a large menu, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Excited to try this place, we sat down at the 50's style booth. The atmosphere was the first thing we noticed. I loved the retro decor. The second and probably most important thing I noticed was the friendly staff. Our waitress was so sweet. Unfortunately, I was on call for my job and had to ask for boxes as soon as our food arrived (due to getting called out for work). As soon as I explained our situation to our waitress she helped get us out the door. We'll definitely be back. And hopefully we'll get to enjoy our meal without having to leave in a hurry. The staff here deserves an A++++. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We can't stop smiling at Johnny's!  It's a step back in time--a real 50s diner with friendly service and food cooked fresh to order!  Give the Greek omelette, the hash browns, the Banana pancakes  a try!  My hubby and I prefer spending our money at  Mom and Pop places like this!  Keep the money in the community is our motto!  And yes, the namesake is the owner!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Really want to like this place. Probably been there 6-8 times......and EVERY TIME...terrible service, small portions, okay food, and not even that cheap for a diner!!! 
So the staff is friendly, but there is no sense of urgency whatsoever. Last time I was there with my mom and 3 year old daughter, her milkshake (which we ordered with our drinks), came out about 15 minutes later (after I asked for it again). And when our food came, it took another 10 minutes for them to bring her chili out. It's chili!!! Isn't it in a big pot in the kitchen?? Can't it just get scooped into a bowl? Sheesh. And this was not an isolated incident.....on various visits I have had my coffee stay unfilled for too long, food come out all different times, and had to go ask for my check. I'm pretty easy to please, actually.....which is why I keep giving it more chances. I know everyone has a bad day. But I think I'm over it. 
Btw, I would rather the owner be in back cooking and making sure people are doing their jobs then walking around and saying hi!!!! Merrrrr"}
{"text":"Great little diner we just happened upon when we were in the area. If you are a fan of the traditional diners of past, this is the place."}
