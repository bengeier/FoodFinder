{"text":"A member of our group got food poisoning from trout entree. Very disappointed. It wad the only thing he ate that no one else ate. Rest of us are fine."}
{"text":"My wife and I hit Valerio's for a casual mid-week date night. We were the last table seated for the night, and even though we probably kept the staff busy a bit later than they might have liked, no one skirted on the service at any point. This didn't go unnoticed, and it was certainly appreciated. The food was fairly good but not overwhelmingly spectacular - we enjoyed the fresh mozzarella di bufala starter and the oreccheitte alla salsiccia. Overall a solid experience, with a rating rounded up for the stellar service we received."}
{"text":"Awful - stay away.  We had a horrible experience at Valerio's.  It took an hour and a half to get our meal after being seated.  The waitress asked if we wanted more bread, we said we did, and she never brought any.  She never asked if we wanted another beverage after the first, and never asked if we wanted ground pepper like they did at other tables.  There were plenty of employees - they were just busy rearranging napkins and silverware on other tables.  It took a ridiculous amount of time to get our salads.  Eventually two of our entrees arrived, and then it took another 5-10 minutes before the other person at our table was served.  The food was lousy too.  My cucumber and onion salad seemed to be an entire shredded onion with a few slices of cucumber.  The Pollo al Limone was so tough you could barely cut it with the knife.  There are much better choices in Little Italy a few steps away, like Etna and Mia Bella.  Don't waste your time or money at Valerio's."}
{"text":"Great meal. In town for my father's medical treatment at Cleveland Clinic. Looked up a spot close to the Clinic and the Intercontinental. I am so glad I stumbled upon Valerio's. It has a nice ambiance, warm staff and it was easy to get in on a Sunday night. We had the orricchiete, ziti and the osso bucco special. The orricchiete had a delicious balanced, creamy tomatoey sauce along with flavorful sausage crumbles. The risotto that came with the osso bucco was extremely flavorful. One thing I loved was that the food came out hot and stayed hot. The dessert was incredible - tartufo? This meal was a huge pick-me-up during our health ordeal."}
{"text":"One of the better places in Little Italy.  It was my first time there and it was a very good experience.  Food was above the norm for the area and we will be returning !"}
{"text":"Unbelievable calamari - we fought over it and sopped up the sauce with our fresh warm bread. And the best Norwegian cod I've ever had. The flavors were out of this world and the clientele was straight out of Good Fellas. I swear Joe Pesci was sitting at the table next to us."}
{"text":"Last Sunday while in Cleveland on a visit we decided on Italian food for dinner and went to Valerio's on recommendation of a friend. The meal that we had was by far the best, authentic Italian food we have eaten in ages, probably since Italy. We shared a special antipasto of bresaola served over arugula with parmesan curls brightened by a squeeze of lemon: simple but perfect due to the quality of the ingredients and the perfectly balanced proportions. I ordered the osso buco served over creamy parmesan infused risotto cooked to perfection with a deeply flavored sauce bringing the whole dish together. The risotto had the right texture....creamy, moist but not soupy. My husband had the penne Bolognese, a traditional dish found in most Italian restaurants. But let me tell you that this was no ordinary Bolognese: in fact it was extraordinary with a complexity and blending of flavors that epitomize the wonder of true Italian cooking.  Accompanied by a good and generous glass of red wine the meal was sublime. The portions are very generous and left us room only for due espressi. 

The restaurant is welcoming and intimate and the waitress, daughter of Valerio, made us feel at home and comfortable throughout the evening. Valerio regularly visited the dining room to check on diners and to greet regulars sitting at the small bar. The atmosphere and fantastic food here makes you want to become part of the \"regulars\".  Buonissimo! Bravo Valerio!"}
{"text":"Dining at Valerio's is always an A+ experience. Sitting at an outside table on a pleasant summer evening with a light breeze makes for an exceptional night.  Lisa the bartender makes the best Martini's and Manhattans.  This family run establishment focuses on fresh ingredients and local produce. The pride in their business is obvious in the preparation of the meal. The food is delicious, well seasoned, and the preparation is spot on. Service is excellent. Menu selections are wide range in choices and price point.
The lobster spaghetti  special is so flavorful as is the Ribeye steak.   Hands down the best steak in Cleveland. This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for date night. Delicious food! Phenomenal cioppino-the best in town packed with seafood. Mushroom ravioli is fantastic. I had a smoked salmon and cream sauce over perfect pasta last night.  The owner/chef is always out asking how your meal is going.  Great place."}
{"text":"I went to Valerio's new location when I was in town visiting family.  Food was delicious!  We had both the calamari and muscles for an appetizer and for an entree I selected the shrimp ravioli.  Food was very fresh, wine was delicous and the room was dimly lit, making for a good dining experience.  

The only negative was the restaurant itself.  I think there is some room for improvement with the decor.  Although I liked the dim lights, the decor is very minimalist and could be spiced up a bit."}
{"text":"I went to valerio's for dinner a couple days ago, and both my and my girlfriends' entrees were excellent. I had the lamb chops, which were perfect- well seasoned with rosemary, lightly charred on the outside and meltingly tender in the centre, while the vegetables that accompanied the lamb were flavorful and elegant. The only complaint I have is that my water glass took a long time to be refilled once empty - however, I'm still happy to rate Valerio's five stars because the service was otherwise good and the food excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing, I mean AMAZING little place!  After an exhausting day at the Cleveland Clinic my fiancé, daughter and I were in the mood for a mood lifting meal.  Thank goodness we found this place!  They were extremely welcoming even though we weren't exactly dressed to their dress code.  I ordered their lightly breaded chicken and my fiancé had the sauteed chicken and mushrooms!  MOUTH WATERING!!  I am not a fan of mushrooms but his chicken was to die for, as was mine! The vegetables were delicious, juicy yet crisp. Just the meal we needed to lift us up!  My daughter, who is 10 and very particular about her food ( as are most children) shared our meals and loved them. Believe it or not she favored the sautéd chicken and mushrooms! MUST EAT HERE!!!  

The waiter and bartender were extremely attentive and accomidating.  Even allowed my daughter to entertain them with her amateur magic tricks!"}
{"text":"First time at this gem in Little Italy,  celebrating our 6 yr wedding anniversary.  Super quaint and I love being greeted with an accent.  We had the Rotolini do Asparagi and a special app to start.  Asparagus was amazing!   Next up Caprese Salad nothing to write home about and penne Ala Bolognes,  simply amazing!!  My husband had the Pollo Funghi he was a fan, I tried their Lobster w spaghetti another special for the night the first plate, I don't know how was dumped all over our table.  Yes this happened,  that's why the three stars.  They tried to replace the meal but rushed it and the lobster was under cooked.  They felt so bad,  dessert and an after drink were on them.  We'll go again for a do over."}
{"text":"Now that Porcelli's is gone, the best place in Little Italy in my opinion.

GOOD STUFF:  If I was going to show someone a little italy type place, Valerio's would be it.  Small and crowded to the point of almost being smothering.  Always a table of old Italian guys sitting there having drinks and food.  Great food and the best Tiramisu I have ever had.  

BAD STUFF:  As above, small and crowded....buy hey, its LITTLE ITALY.  I wouldn't want it any other way.  Bar can get so crowded at times that it spills into the dining area.  Can be noisy as well.

PRICE:  about 80$ for two with bottle of wine.

OVERALL:  This place is great!  If you're going to have one dinner in little Italy this is the place to go.  Feels authentic and the food and desserts are awesome."}
{"text":"Great cozy, intimate Italian restaurant.  Updated decor unlike some places on the street in need of a major update.  I love that it is not a zoo/factory in here.  Good variety of food.  Started with the dinner salad..nothing more than a pile of mixed greens.  Balsamic vinaigrette was good.  I went with the Orechiette with sausage and the man of the house went with spaghetti.  Both dishes were good but I felt like the sauce was missing something...garlic perhaps? Just a little dull.  Sausage was yummy in my tummy.  Great all-Italian wine list with Sangiovese for $5 a glass.  Score.  Chef Valerio is visible in the dining room when he comes out to greet many regular diners.  Bartender was also our waitress.  Very friendly and good service.  She said Valerio makes a family meal for the staff each night.  Very cool.  Nice spot for a quiet dinner with occasional live acoustic music from a 1-man band."}
{"text":"Had a similar horrible experience here. Was enjoying ourselves at the feast all day and came here for dessert and wine and after telling them they had two separate people confirm that we were only having dessert and not dinner. They both were incredibly rude, then at the end of the night they put the wrong credit card on our bill and barely said anything after we told them. no apology, no explanation. it was a real bummer to the end of our evening. If you don't want to give your table away for dessert then just ask us to leave, don't be jerks about it."}
{"text":"I ordered the bolognese, it was okay.  Maybe I ordered the wrong dish, but they did give you a ton of food, not sure if I'd be back."}
{"text":"For our second wedding anniversary, my husband and I wanted to try a restaurant that was out of our usual rotation. After deciding on trying something in Little Italy, we came upon Valerio's.  We had no problem making same-day reservations for a Saturday at 8:30pm. The restaurant was easy to find, which was useful as we had to find street parking on a nearby side street. Upon entering, it's a little dark, but it goes with the cozy ambience of the restaurant. The tables have little candles to help add atmosphere lighting as well. It was pretty crowded for a Saturday night, and there was live piano music, which lent a bustling feeling to the place. We started our dinner with the Rotolini di Asparagi appetizer, which was a grouping of three asparagus shoots wrapped in provolone and prosciutto. This was extremely well cooked and absolutely delicious. Our only complaint was that we wish there was one more bundle of asparagus for the price. For my entree, I ordered the Pollo al Limone, a boneless chicken breast in a lemon and white wine sauce. I decided to have a side of spaghetti rather that the included veggies-zucchini and roasted red skin potatoes. My husband went with the Penne alla Bolognese and substituted the penne for spaghetti as well. What was interesting about the Bolognese was that, rather than using all beef, 50% of the meat was buffalo. According to my husband, this lent a little bit more depth of flavor to the meat sauce, which he liked. Both of our dishes were well cooked and well presented, and the pasta was cooked al dente, which we appreciated. Our entrees were very reasonably priced and we had leftovers for lunch the next day! I also ordered an amaretto sour, which was pretty decent. I just wish there wasn't so much ice in it, which really surprised both of us-the glass was nearly filled with ice cubes from top to bottom. Other than the amount of ice, the drink was good. It was getting a little late in the evening, so we decided to forego the dessert selection. Service was attentive and staff members were very friendly. Overall, we had a very good experience and would visit Valerio's again. Especially because I want to try some of their desserts, like their lemon sorbet!"}
{"text":"the same for the past 10 yrs which is just awesome.  Same owner, same staff and same great food.  We love the specials and you can let them pick the wine (they won't just pick the expensive stuff either, they are honest).   Next best thing is walking around Little Italy after, going to get Coffee and pastries (or ice cream) are all part of the experience.  This is really nice when you want to make more of an evening out of dinner."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews but I was compelled to do so. I had probably one of the most memorable dinning experience last night at Valerio's in Little Italy.  I grew up in little italy and have dined at most of the Resturaunt's but never at Valero's. I have to say the food was incredible.  The service was excellent.  My wife and I both felt were in italy. Whenever I see spaghetti con vongole on the menu I try it.  My grandmother made the best spaghetti con vongole with red sauce. So This dish is my litmus test and it was as good as nonna's for sure. Let me tell you although Valerio's does it in white sauce it was fantastic. I was amazed, my wife's Osso buco their specially was also incredible Probably the best we have ever had. The staff at Valerio's was so warm and kind.  The place is small and cozy just like places you find in italy.  I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I was checking the menu out with my lady on date night and was told to not pass up on Cleveland Heights Little Italy's finest. Off a whim we decided to go for it. 

Quaint and quiet spot with great food at a great price. Pasta dishes were excellent, we had the Gorgonzola gnocchi and Tortellini with a tomato mushroom sauce with lobster chucks.  They have an extensive wine selection.  Two entrees and a $40 bottle for a reasonable price. 

As a DC foodie, if you are in the area I would highly recommend this lovely restaurant. Great restaurant and quick service too!!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to in little Italy. My boyfriend and I went here for a date night about a month ago. The restaurant was very cozy. We were seated in a corner which was dimly lighted except for the candle on the table- very romantic! The restaurant definitely has a relaxed feel, but is more dressed up than the other restaurants in the area.
Our server was very attentive throughout the meal. 
He stopped by our table often, but also kept his distance and kept an eye on us from afar- allowing us to have some privacy. He was very knowledgable about the menus, which was great because a lot of it is in Italian. The bottle of wine he recommended was great! 
The food was fantastic. It's much more dressed up Italian rather than your typical spaghetti and meatballs. We started with the beef carpaccio and the caprese salad, both of which were fantastic. Then we both had pasta dishes for our entree. His was orecchiette with tomato sauce and Italian sauce and mine was a cheese tortellini in a cream sauce with prosciutto and peas (similar to a carbonara). They were both delicious, but mine was the clear winner. The portions were huge and our leftovers ended up being a second dinner for us the next day. 
Although a bit pricier than other little Italy restaurants, Valerios has my vote as best restaurant. Already thinking about next time!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Four of us dined there. The sides are old and tired. Bird's-eye vegetables would be better. The risotto might have been Stouffer's if they were lucky. The tiramisu was a joke - a cobbler full of whip cream!  (Literally) Meanwhile pasta putanesca was DOA. Seafood pasta with wine sauce would have been better at a chain restaurant. This was the second bad meal in two weeks (a friend insisted on trying them again!) This for $200+
Save your time and $$$$"}
{"text":"Valerio's is a shoe box-sized Little Italy gem! It has (approximately) an 8-stool bar and maybe 10 tables. Reservations are a must on weekends and prepare to be a bit cramped, especially if waiting for a table.

Food and atmosphere are both authentic (to this non-Italian, at least). Service was genuine and personal. My favorite spot in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"The absolute best restaurant in Cleveland's Little Italy!

THE UP-SIDE:  Everything an Italian restaurant should be!  Valerio's is small, quaint, and overflowing with an authentic Italian restaurant vibe.  The food is absolutely outstanding and the staff is incredibly nice.  To top it off, the prices are very reasonable for such an outstanding dining experience.  (Expect to pay about $75 for a dinner for two with wine.)  By far, the nicest, little restaurant in Cleveland's Little Italy.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:  The place is small, and that's part of the charm.  However, it's also VERY busy on weekends.  Thus, it's always a challenge getting seated at the exact time of your reservation.  Just relax, sit at the bar, and wait.  It's worth it!

THE SUM-IT-UP:  A small, bustling, wonderful little Italian restaurant that is not to be missed.  Don't go here expecting things to happen on a quick timeline.  Sit down, relax, soak up the atmosphere and enjoy some incredible Italian food - at a leisurely pace.

Good stuff!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here this summer and was meaning write a review, but after last night I decided that it was time to share! The setting itself is small, as other reviewers have noted, but the secret here is the honest approach to cooking. Yes, they have a lot of good salads, but the perfectly selected greens, dressing, and a tomato make the \"house\" salad a delight. We ended up splitting a Rack of Lamb as our entree and it was perfectly cooked, with wonderful flavors, and a single sprig of Rosemary as a garnish. Paired with boiled potatoes, that looked liked they were finished in a roasting pan, every part of the dish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Valerio was at the door when we arrived and even laughed at my first attempt and success at parallel parking in a tight spot (I was lucky).  We had a glass of their Chianti by the glass with our meal and it was very good. There was a single server on duty and she greeted guests, brought them to their tables, and provided service a with a very easy and warm style. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever experienced in 20+ years of going to Murray hill. Customer is always wrong here."}
{"text":"Great place. Food was great, had the rack of Lamb which was one of the specials of the night. One of the best.
Our waitress Lisa, was by far the best waitress I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience.  The food was good, not great.  The Osso buco was excellent but the seafood risotto was in broth, which meant they hadn't paid enough attention to the preparation of the dish for the rice to absorb all of the liquid.  It tasted fine but it wasn't the preparation that it should have been, especially given the price of the dish.  But that wasn't the real problem . . . 

I had literally just finished signing my credit card slip and the owner of the restaurant essentially told us that she needed to flip our table.  We hadn't been at the restaurant a long time nor were we dawdling, but in her mind it was \"just time for us to go!\"  I was floored by this.  We had just spent $150 on dinner for two and allowing us to finish was not on her agenda.

There have been comments on this site about the service at this restaurant.  Take heed.  You are entering a high-priced fast food area."}
{"text":"I walked in here with a group of (8) friends after having dinner down the road. It was later during the night and the server asked if we were going to have dinner, we told him that all we wanted was drinks and desserts. He asked to stand for a moment and told us that he had to take the tablecloth off the table because we weren't having dinner. He said that those tablecloths are expensive and he then put some paper over the table. We walked out. Never going back to this place. I don't usually review bad experiences, but this was really rough, especially having people from out of town."}
{"text":"Very good place in a great restaurant neighborhood.  Little Italy in Cleveland is a great spot in the world.  If you have to be in Cleveland for some reason, check this place out."}
{"text":"Our favorite in little Italy. Very authentic food! We usually start at the bar for a cocktail . Lisa the bartender is wonderful and then off to an intimate table. Te whole staff is very warm & help to always make it a fabulous experience."}
{"text":"This is a unique experience in the Little Italy area.  If there was one word to describe the ambiance it would be cozy.  The dining room is relatively small with a bar and a variety of table sizes from tables for two to tables for eight.  The menu has a nice variety of items and there are daily specials.  I really like the calimari appetizer - sauteed instead of breaded was nice.  Their daily special appetizers are good as well.  There is a nice variety of pasta and seafood options for entrees.  There is a full bar and fairly extensive wine list.  Their tiramisu for dessert is very good.  Service was attentive and timely.  Overall, a great place for a quiet Italian dinner in the bustling Little Italy area."}
{"text":"Hands down best restaurant in Little Italy. I have been coming here since I was a little girl. Valerio is the man and always so nice. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for some good, authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 6pm on a Friday night. We got right in and ordered drinks. The waiter was very detailed in his explanation of the specials. I had the pasta with 50% beef and 50% bison meat sauce. The mixture gives it an incredible unique flavor. 

Their bread is very soft and fresh. I topped it off with a glass of Pinot Noir. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here.  Good wine list, great gnocchi and wonderful service"}
{"text":"True Italian restaurant with simple and fresh ingredients. I had guests with me that had a few allergies. They were more than accommodating and very gracious in surpassing my guests expectations in their meal selections.

I have dined here four times this year. I truly believe that they have the best veal dishes in the city. Chef Valerio always takes the opportunity to check on his guests that are dining. 

I highly recommend the Calamari in the spicy red sauce. Request no breading on the Calamari. 

The salads are simple and are served with very fresh ingredients.

They do offer gluten free pastas for dinner. 

The 22oz long bone ribeye steak was perfectly seasoned. 

Carry on Valerio's! I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"There are a dozen great restaurants in Little Italy, of course, but this one is our go-to place for a good evening.  It's a relatively small restaurant, so it's wise to reserve in advance, although we have successfully gotten a table on a walk-in."}
{"text":"I'm not very experienced with places to go to for dinner in Little Italy, so I relied on  the ratings of Yelp and other sites. They led me to Valerio's, and I must say that I was very pleased with the food. My dish was tasty and the price was comparable, if not better than, similar restaurants nearby. The rest of the experience was a little lackluster. 

This is a small establishment. I'm talking a total of 12 tables, so you might want to plan ahead. I booked a table a few days in advance via OpenTable. Even on a Sunday evening, it was filled. The ambience is superb. This is a cozy place for a date night or a more upscale dinner. I wouldn't feel comfortable here in anything less than khakis and a button down.  

Starting off, we were seated right as we came in, so they were true to the reservation time. We ordered drinks and were given bread, but it's like they lost track of us for a while from then on.  They eventually swapped our server and another woman took care of us. After about a half hour of sitting with only bread and first round of drinks, they took our food order.  

The food was phenomenal. Even though they have \"first\" and \"second\" plates, it's not necessary to have one of each.  It's not listed on the menu, but the \"second plate\" came with potatoes and vegetables to my surprise. More food is always better, so I was happy to see that when it came out. Definitely try the chicken and mushrooms. The white cream sauce was far superior than the red sauce of the other dish I tried. I'm salivating just thinking of it again.  

A couple things that detracted from the whole experience...One being that the restroom could use an update. It was cold on a December evening and had the ceiling panels shifted and stained with what looked like water damage. Also, when it came time for the bill, I only received a \"Customer Copy\" which I filled out as I normally would the \"Restaurant's Copy.\" It didn't click with me until afterwards, but I realized this could be dangerous and I continued to check my credit card statement for the charge. It eventually went through with the correct tip I had designated so no harm overall."}
{"text":"The night I went there was a big party happening at the next three table. and still I didnt think it was too loud. Maybe the other reviewers like it library quiet? anyway - thats my whole view on atmosphere. now to the real review - - the food here is delicious and authentic. No wolfgangpucky nonsense going on here. Just excellent Italian food. Even thier bread is delicious."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in little Italy. Much better than Mia Bella. Better value and flavor than Giovanni's in Beachwood.

The menu is not large but each of the offerings are cooked to perfection. I have had both seafood and meat entrees and all have been exceptional in taste and preparation. They don't do take out unfortunately. The osso bucco is amazing. Prices are reasonable and portions are generous.

Only criticism is the parking, they do have valet, but parking in little Italy is generally frustrating."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Valerio's with my wife for our 15th anniversary dinner. We started off with champagne, wine, and water along with a charcuterie board.  The meats, cheese, and tomatoes were fresh and delicious! The free dinner bread went well with the board.

I ordered the mushroom ravioli and my wife ordered puttanesca. I sipped my cabernet, which was excellent with a very bold nose and dark, fruity flavors. I loved it. My wife ordered chardonnay, but didn't comment about it. 

Our server was extremely friendly and attentive, to a fault, at the beginning and middle of the meal, but he sort of disappeared near the end of the meal.  

My cheese ravioli with mushrooms in cream sauce was divine. I absolutely loved it. The mushrooms were large, fresh, and tasty. The house made ravioli was just delicious. I can't wait to try the chicken, mushrooms, and cream sauce one day. I tasted my wife's puttanesca and it was just okay to me. She absolutely loved it though. 

We shared a crème brulee for dessert, which was also very good.

Other than the lack of refills near the end of the meal, this was a great experience.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place REALLY is a gem. Recently spent and ENTIRE EVENING here when we were only planning to stop in for an appetizer. We walked in, grabbed a spot at the bar, and that was it. We were in love. The bartender was super friendly and so fun to spend time with. She was really working triple time to accomodate the guests on a busy Saturday night. It was nice to chat with Valerio when he had a moment to rest. I must say I love a restaurant where you get to speak to the person actually responsible for the recipes.

I'm almost embarrased to say that were still there as the staff was closing up shop. They were so kind as to shower us with items not on the menu as they were having dinner now that they had time. SO GOOD!!!!! Amazing ambiance, amazing wine/cocktails and amazing food. 

Do make reservations though. This place is really tiny. Bar is indeed about 8 stools and there are about 10 tables which fill up early on a Saturday night. GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Lobster Spaghetti rocks. Perfectly cooked lobster over spaghetti. Impressive dish- love it!"}
{"text":"Lovely intimate dining room. Staff was attentive and knowledgable. We shared a salad and appetizer for fun. Baked asparagus wrapped in prosciutto was excellent.  Requested three baskets of bread!! We both loved our main course. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came in as part of our Little Italy food tour and had 2 pasta dishes. We had a tortellini with fresh peas and proscuito as well as a penne with bolognese. Both were delicious! They even made an entire special plate for the vegetarian in our tour! The tortellini had such a light creamy sauce that was amazing with the peas and the bolognese was tasty. We will definitely come back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Just happened to wonder into this little jem for the first time last night.  The food was great, service was good and drinks were strong.  I felt at home, and I'll be back."}
