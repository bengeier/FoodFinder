{"text":"Definitely one of the better food trucks I have visited in the area.  ''
Asian Cuisine ..  the quality of the food is pretty good.  The Dog-Zilla is tasty - Beef hot dog -with slaw and sirarcha ketchup..  and I love the spicy chicken fried rice.    The menu items stay the same - but change with seasons.  I inquired during my last visit.   This food truck is parked at Woods Run on Fridays at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Was in a hurry and the line was short so decided to give WoL another try.  I guess I should have tried something else.  The Chicken and Cilantro Dumplings were good. The Spicy Chicken Fried Rice was not.  Should have just moved on."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars from my bestie. They were working hard to keep guests happy.  My best friend tried the veggies and white steamed rice. She liked it and may have liked it more if it was not 90 degrees but that is no one's fault. Smelled delightful and everyone seemed to enjoy."}
