{"text":"In a a word- SUB-PAR.  Speed of Service - Slow and Lacking (Took 20 minutes to get appetisers and then another 50 to get our main sushi rolls.  I also had to get up to ask for bowls to pour soy sauce into).  Quality of Service - Poor and Too Little to Late (People who came after us were serviced their special dishes long before we got our basic sushi dishes.  Server only came at the end to apologise when we told them we were unhappy).  Food - Average at Best (the long wait was not worth it and tasted like a first time sushi maker).  Would not recommend this place and extremely disappointing in this attempt as it is across the street from Gurei Sushi."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Nice interior design and the sushi is really fresh! The lady server (I think who is the owner) is super nice and greets everyone very happily.  The portions and price are reasonable.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We visit Iruka almost on a weekly basis. Between the two of us, we get the love boat a lot and it never dissapoints. The corn tea is a must have and the Miso soup is the honestly one of if not the best in the city. This place is super intimate with friendly staff and extremely fresh food all the time.   The candies at the end of the meal are incredible and end the meal on a sweet note.   Happy eating folks!"}
{"text":"Bad service (After waiting pretty much an hour for our food, when it did come, there were no plates or utensils. I got my apple juice in a 300 ml plastic bottle and no cup. When we did the waiter brought out the cup holding it with his two fingers on the brim of the cup.) , Miso soup was cold, lady was very rude, and I will never go back."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came down to have Shoyu and Miso ramen today since it was quite a chilly day. Waitress was very friendly and food came quite fast. Soup was just not salty and temperature was just right for me.. Portion was perfect for me but it may not be enough for some people Overall, i give 5 star rating and would definitely come back for sushi!"}
{"text":"FutokmakI was good. Wasabi wasn't very hot though.  Ramen broth was very lacking, mostly just chilly oil.  Sushi rice in itself was sweet, too much vinegar? Sushi didn't hold together very well.  Nice service. Well decorated. Would try again in a few months if they makes some changes."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The portions are huge and we usually have the salmon teriyaki.  Tempura is really good too."}
{"text":"Service is very slow, and they got my order wrong once, but the food has always been good. I eat only veggie sushi. It's always fresh and yummy, tan tempura roles are crispy and delicious. I've never tried their delivery because I don't think they'd be quite as good soggy."}
{"text":"Saw this new place a few days back and thought I would try it. Really amazing sushi. Very fresh seafood and amazing service.  Would definitely make this as my regular eating out place. The only issue I had was a lack of bar... But i guess they will add it soon"}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi spots to eat in and take out! Great service, the food is always fresh, and it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Surprisingly this place makes a decent ramen. The sushi is average and so is the service. Keep in mind I've only done take out at this  restaurant and this could be the reason why my experience has been been so so"}
{"text":"These guys are the best!! They always keep the portions big and your money will definitely worth it. So tasty!! And also they really friendly. Strongly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The service has improved dramatically but even then the food has always been 1. Fresh 2. Presented right 3. Tastes great. I wish they had a better wine menu. And do not forget to go next door for Gelato. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday before my dance class. I had an early lunch so I wasn't very full and had a room for a quick bite. Although I only ordered a small dish, the restaurant  offered me a complimentary noodle soup, which was very nice. I decided to come back again for a lunch a week later.   Overall, the fish is fresh and food tastes authentic to me. Unfortunately, they don't offer lunch combos for weekend so I got the dinner menu, which is a few dollars more expensive than the amazing lunch deals people are wowing about. I ended up paying around 18 dollars for it.   I think it is a pretty decent place considering if you live nearby or come to hang out along queen's quay. I don't think I will come all the way to have food here but I will stop by once a while when I am in the neighbourhood. Compared to what is offering nearby, I still think it is a pretty good spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Overall impression: not the best sushi I've had, but not the worst.   I ordered their dinner maki a special which came with 6 pieces california and 8 pieces of the dynamite, along with miso soup and salad. Also got complimentary Japanese styles chicken noodle soup. Their rolls were nothing much. Seaweed was a little stale and their tempura was overfried. California rolls were good but then again, california rolls are a staple to any sushi restaurant in Toronto.   Service was quick and pleasant. We came early on a Friday evening and the restaurant wasn't very full yet. The sushi came about 10 minutes after ordering which surprised me at how quick they were able to prepare it. By the time we left, the restaurant was almost full."}
{"text":"Moved into the neighborhood a week ago and have already had Iruka sushi twice! Tiny sushi joint on the quay but they've been busy both times I've gone to pick up.   MUST TRY: spicy yam tempura roll. Omg, I can't get enough. Perfectly crispy with spicy mayo and sweet glaze. Salmon has been super fresh, and rice was still warm both times I ordered take out. Dinner combos come with delicious miso soup and traditional salad. Have never been hungry after. We will be back lots, so happy to discover this little gem!"}
{"text":"You're an American Tourist???? Go here! Go anywhere! I was drunk and wondered in here.  It was good and cheap since the USD is worth a lot more haha! I had the sushi dinner which is the chefs special. Like 14usd or 20cad. Not bad, was delicious!  I'd say the service does need to be a little quicker but they were getting ready to close when I came through anyway."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sushi is good but service just puts you off the food. I stopped by to order take out, nothing complicated, just a couple of rolls.  When I ordered, I noticed there was no one in the back kitchen. All three chefs had stepped outside for a break.  They ambled back in about 10 minutes later and start prepping food.  By this time, two other people had walked in behind me and placed an order for food.  About a half hour in I see the servers packing up what I knew was my order, and hand it to waiting customers. The servers are either running around the restaurant or stuck in the back so I couldn't even get their attention to advise them of the error.  Finally, the customer who received my order returned, just as irate as I was at this point, and I got my takeout with a mumbled apology.  I was half hoping the food was terrible, but I enjoyed it, so it's a shame their service isn't up to par."}
{"text":"My hubby wanted to try the new sushi joint in the neighborhood, despite my argument to go with the \"tried and true\".  I hate to say \"I told ya so\", but I did.  We had our choice of tables, because the \"after 8pm dinner rush\" hadn't arrived yet.  We were asked about drinks right away and luckily I knew we wanted some appetizers because I was able to order them with our drinks. Got our drinks right away and our edamame.... And that was it, for 45 min. We did order our mains in that time - all the while thinking our second app would be coming soon.  By this time all the table were full, so with ONE SERVER (who I think was also the owner) we were not really a concern.  We watched other diners get their mains when we still hadn't received our sushi pizza.  Finally it arrived.  But, we didn't have any soya sauce dishes or plates.  My hubby got up to ask for it and the woman was clueless to what he was asking for.  We got a salad (that we didn't order - I think to by the time).  Then miso soup (for the wait, even though I had ordered one). We were VERY close to getting up and leaving at this point, but I was starving and knew we would have to wait somewhere else for food. Finally after being there for an hour plus of sitting there, our main sushi and rolls arrived.  It was only then that the woman apologized for the wait and explained someone called in sick, but by then the damage was already done - we had decided we were not coming back.  The woman knew we were pissed and pretty much chased out of the resto, saying next time it will be \"much better\".  Sorry, first impressions last.  As for the food, nothing amazing.  Actually not that great at all.  I don't even know if there was salmon in the spicy salmon roll, and not just tempura and spicy mayo.  The Green Dragon Roll tasted weird - the sauce on top was too sweet.  Unagi sushi tasted like a BBQ.  All-in-all, not a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times - great sushi, awesome ramen, and I love the little soup they give you when you're waiting. The prizes are good for the amazing food that you get. Couldn't be happier. The service is also top notch."}
{"text":"Great location for those in Cityplace or nearby. Went there for take-out this past weekend and the servers were super friendly and quick to take my order. The food itself was pretty decent. A little on the pricey side, but the portions were fairly large.  Got a peak at some of the sushi boats they served, and definitely want to go back and try eating in next time.  Would recommend for those looking for something quick and easy around Harborfront area."}
{"text":"This place recently opened at Queens Quay and Dan Leckie Way. Really nice interior. The sushi is not bad (don't take my word for it; I'm far from a sushi connoisseur & everyone has a preference in their love for sushi). They have maki roll specials. I love this because sometimes, all I want is a lotta maki :) However, the two rolls I ordered, spider and dynamite, did tend to fall apart a bit.  The staff is really friendly. I got tea when I arrived, they engage in small talk when it's not too busy and will even open the door for you when you're leaving. Extra star for that."}
{"text":"I thought that the fish was pretty decent but it was cut really huge and thick, uneven. I got the chirashi and it was presented nicely but wish it came with more - a bit overpriced for what you get. Compared to other places they give you very basic stuff for $20 :/ ah well at least it was clean and pretty quick."}
{"text":"Sushimi lunch was very good and well priced. Waitress was very curious and polite. I would definitely come back here again. Food came to me in a good time as well."}
{"text":"Had the sushi.  All the food had amazing flavour. The dishes were brought to the table one by one. Each dish added to the tasting experience of the previous.  The service was very good. The interior is beautiful and it feels intimate. The food portions were generous and the pricing was affordable.  It all contributed to a unique experience that sets this restaurant apart from other Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing pleasantly surprised. My flight was delayed at Billy Bishop Airport so I went to the closest restaurant. I didn't wanna stuff myself so I got the spicy tuna sashimi. . It was so fresh and delicious I got the spicy salmon sashimi right after. I also ordered their sweet potatoe noodles which so good. Also their green salad was a step above normal ones. It had apple and avacado.  I'll be back for sure and bring friends. Not happy my flight was delayed but very happy I found this place"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. Great variety, the food is delicious and the service is great. Has a view of the lake. Can't really ask for more than that. Right across from the airport...we'll be going there quite often."}
{"text":"I live nearby at Bathurst/Lakeshore.  My husband & I really love the food here, very fresh & beautifully prepared.  Our favourite is Unagi Don, Unagi Handroll, and Caterpillar Roll. The rice is moist & perfectly balanced with all the ingredients.  We've eaten Unagi Don (eel) in Toronto & Vancouver, and this is by far my favourite. They make it so perfectly tasty. Some places burn the eel so that it's blackened/ruined, or too salty, but Iruka cooks it just right, not burnt & really flavourful.  The presentation is beautiful & the taste is even better.  Really appreciate having this gem so close to home. Staff is polite."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with the service here. They kept forgetting about us even though the place was only half full. Our teas were not refilled and our sushi kept coming out without any ginger or wasabi so we had to ask for more.   The sushi was good to start but I think they ran out of rice and used very hot rice for our last roll so the roll tasted gooey."}
{"text":"I came here couple times, it was close to my home and convince. This time I had sushi and sashimi boat and it was very very disappointed. Sashimi was chopped like diced potato. It was worse than cheap food court. It is value deal combo. But does not meat it's cheap either. I rather pay more and get fresh fat cut sashimi. I won't go back again"}
{"text":"Went back here for sit in lunch with a coworker, food arrived quickly. Irena (owner/server) was very attentive and made sure we had all the necessary items/our appropriate order! I definitely recommend coming here for lunch as the combos are bang for buck!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite before our flight. It was definitely better than the airport, but not by much.   We had a katsu dinner and two rolls. The black dynamite roll was 7/10. But the deep fried California roll was awful. The chicken katsu itself was fine, but the accompanying sauce and salad were the worst; the salad dressing was literally mayo and ketchup.   The service was average, as was the ambiance.   Overall not terrible, but not good either."}
{"text":"They give out complimentary soups or a mini noodle sample, the sushi was fresh and delicious. Been here several times before and their quality is always consistent. The large sushi maki tray was good to fill up 4 people. The kalbi was nicely marinated and wasnt hard to chew on,  which is very important in my opinion. The eel bulgolgi and the salmon pizza was very good as well. Definitely a place that is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"The restaurant's very clean and the service was neat. And most importantly the food is amazing! Their sushi is very fresh and tasty unlike a lot of the other small sushi restaurants. I highly recommend giving this spot a try if youre into Japanese food."}
{"text":"Very poor value. I ordered the Sashimi Moriawase and they gave me the smallest slices of fish I ever seen in my life. This was 20 pieces and more than half the fish was salmon!  I am still starving as I write this.   Service was good though. I will give them that. Clean space. But terrible value."}
{"text":"A solid sushi restaurant with good prices and quality...Contantly improving and evolving...ramen suprisingly amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick snack before our dinner reservations at a different restaurant (we were starving after a long walk by lakeshore). Definitely worth it! (Full review to come when we go back for a real meal)  The rolls came in a timely matter, and the service as good. The restaurant is quite small, could probably fit about 40 patrons. It was less than half full when we were there. The decor was cute, nice and clean as well.   We only ordered one thing off the menu to share and it was the Black Dragon Roll (SM13 on the menu). It was delicious, the ingredients were fresh, the rice was perfect and the sauce made it even better. I didn't even use the soy sauce. It had a really comforting feeling in my mouth, a feeling that you don't get at every sushi restaurant. We were on the verge of ordering more but we had to leave room for dinner but we will definitely come back for a full meal."}
{"text":"Directly along Queens Quay/Harbourfront, this is probably the sushi place I prefer to go to. The sushi is good and the service is great. They often give complimentary noodle soup and if you're lucky an extra miso soup and salad even though only one of you ordered a combo. I went to dinner with my sister here and we shared a sushi boat. Everything was fresh, nothing frozen. If you order the volcano roll, they add a bit of fire to it so it's flaming at the sides. It's pretty cool. I'm not sure if they still do it now. The price is decent. I also order take out from this place and it's usually ready in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Definitely recommand this sushi place. Not the best in toronto,  but for a night out i would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Grocery store sushi tastes better than this place.  Service - was speedy but I came in at 3pm on a Thursday.  Food - I ordered spicy salmon and spicy crab roll. It was very bland and no spice.  One of My crab rolls had some sort of crunchy shell inside it   Much better sushi places around - try Sushi Xtra on Queen"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighbourhood sushi place! They take such great care in making the food and packing it, a rarity for takeout spots. I don't think I've eaten sushi anywhere else in the city since I found this place."}
{"text":"If I wasn't Canadian I might have given it 2 Stars.   The Good: - Clean - Good Service - Fair Prices - Patio - very close to Island Airport  The Bad - i've had better food at cheap all you can eat sushi restaurants   The Ugly - they may have the worst rice ever served at an Asian restaurant. (they did say they were our or white rice but that's almost like running out of fish)"}
{"text":"The second time come here for the dinner. The food tastes not bad...but the service is not very good. You always need to Waite long time for the dishes. If you are really hungry, you'd better to choice other place. Very close to the lake."}
