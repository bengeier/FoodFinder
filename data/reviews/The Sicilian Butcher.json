{"text":"Its was ok. I got the sausage meatballs and Arrabiata sauce. Needed more sauce. Spaghetti noodles appeared to be round, although the description said square. Friend got the Uncle Arthur meatballs with same sauce and noodles. She said hers were just \"ok\" as well.  Price point a little high. We bought this as a take out order. Might be better eating it in resturant. Walked in to pick up food and resturant was nice, clean, open. With the open space, the music was quite loud, and sounded like heavy metal. Didnt gel with atmosphere."}
{"text":"Took the kiddos here around 4pm after school pick up to meet my sister to check out this new spot! We got the meat and cheese board, bruschetta board and the kids got the kids meal spaghetti & meatball. Let's not forget my sister and I each got a glass of wine. Everything was amazing and devoured. Definitely coming back. Toni our server was awesome. The kids loved her! Bravo especially on opening night!!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Advertised happy hour, all day, every day with $5.00 wine and beer (sitting at the bar only) If you don't want to drink at the bar, depending on the wine you chose, it can be $10.00.  Double the price???really?? I did not see prices on the wine menu.  The Sicilian Salad was not very substantial.  There wasn't much of the few ingredients it had in it.  The lump of pureed olives in the middle did not look very appetizing.  It overpowered the salad and it did not sit well with me the rest of the night.  Maybe I just chose the wrong things."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time and WOW!! From just walking up to the place it has great out side decor with an amazing patio and fireplace.
We walked in and sat at the bar and we were greeted right away. 
My and my girlfriend were just stopping by for a glass of wine and to check out the new spot since we already ate..  but after looking at the menu and seeing all the amazing food being served all around us we had to try something. 
 So sitting in the bar area they offer a all day everyday happy hour. $5 wine and beer and $8 specialty cocktails . We ordered the meat and cheese board which I have featured in the picture and for $10 it doesn't get any better ! 
For a place being open only a couple weeks it's amazing !! I have been to many of the Maggiore restaurants and this one is my new favorite! We will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu. Can't wait to try some of that homemade pasta everyone was eating!"}
{"text":"Famtastic. Sit at the bar for the bottle and board for $19. All the balls are amazing. Great new place! Say hi to Joe at the bar!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere. We will be back. The veal meatballs are incredible, and I am not a meatball guy."}
{"text":"Really fun outdoor seating area, with turf and hanging lights. Food was great, we just had lunch so we opted for bruschetta and a salad to share. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. It's a great location and the menu looked good but the service leaves a lot to be desired. A group of three of us went for an early dinner Saturday night, place wasn't super crowded but you could tell they were gearing up for a big night. Too many servers just standing around doing nothing and distracting the servers who did currently have tables.

A member of our party arrived before we did, and we were told he was greeted and served immediately. However, when we arrived it took almost 15 minutes for our server to come back and take our drink order, only for another server to walk up, cut him off, and proceed to argue (right in front of us) that our table was now HIS table. The servers bickered with each other for a few minutes, again right at our table side, and the first server eventually conceded. The second server stated he'd be right back to take our drink order. 10 minutes later...nothing. He did eventually come back, took our drink order again, and then rambled off something about having a \"shift meeting\" so he was running behind. 

Tried a Sicilian spritz, which was essentially a gigantic mimosa, and my husband had wine. He said the wine was ok, but not worth the price tag. We were going to order the pasta friti but were told by our server the menus we were given were wrong, and they didn't have that. He ran off to find new menus, which took another 5 minutes even though we were sitting right by the host stand. We ended up ordering a meat & cheese charcuterie board which was tossed on our table without any explanation as to the meats (2 types), cheeses (2 1/2), or jams 1 1/2 types) that were on the board. Also, it says on the menu it is supposed to have toast points but what we received was two small slices of grilled bread that was more burnt than grilled. It was only burnt on one side, and you could tell they tried to cover it up by putting the burnt side face down on the board.

Our server came back twice within 10 minutes of having our appetizer to ask if we were ready to order our mains yet. I understand it's starting to get busy, but when you have to keep interrupting our conversation to see if we are ready to order (and our appetizer isn't even half gone), take a hint we clearly aren't ready. He seemed borderline annoyed with how long we were taking to enjoy our app and drinks, which is funny becuase he fought tooth and nail for our table. Let us take our time and we will probably order more food. 

The meatball ordering system is a little confusing, but worth the price if you have room to eat it all. We tried three different combinations, all of which were good but not amazing. Food came to the table and was auctioned off which I HATE, and our server didn't come back until we were almost through. I ordered another cocktail, the Milan Margarita, which I couldn't even drink because the ratios were so off. When our server asked if there was anything wrong with the drink, and I said it was too bitter and tasted like it was possibly made incorrectly all he could say was \"yeah, we've heard that a lot. The bartender here tonight is not great\" WHO SAYS THAT?! and didn't even offer to bring me another drink or at the very least take it away. 

We left well fed, but hesitant to return. Will probably give them a few months to get on their feet and then try again. Maybe."}
{"text":"If you love Italian food and enjoy thoughtful service, you have to try this restaurant.

The authentic hand-made pasta al forno was executed perfectly.  The Tomaso's meatballs were delicious.  The service was top notch: from the menu descriptions, to the dinner recommendations, Christie provided impeccable service and was a delight to converse with. One of their offered artisanal cocktails, such as The Italiano, is an essential order for anyone who appreciates a unique and well made drink.

The Sicilian Butcher is always a good decision."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here. Christie, our server was absolutely amazing, her recommendations were stellar. We ordered the arancini as our appetizer which were fried stuffed risotto balls, my boyfriend got the tomaso's meatball on baked pasta, which was superb. I ordered uncle aurther's meatball w/vodka sauce on paccheri pasta, also delicious. We tried the Italiano and I must say this is a fine cocktail, especially if you're a fan of bourbons and even if your not! It's reminiscent of an Old Fashion w/an Italian twist. This place is a must try if you're in the area looking for hearty authentic rustic homemade pastas and meatballs. Ask for Christie, she won't steer you wrong."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and a great menu. The beet salad was delicious. Fresh pasta with a wonderful variety of meatballs and sauces! Can't wait to go back and try more variations."}
{"text":"My husband and I were eager to try the new neighborhood restaurant! The minute we sat down we told the server we were ready to order as we were hungry! When tables were receiving their food after we sat down, we asked the server to inquire about our order. After 45 minutes with no food, we asked to see The manager Jeff (?). Still no food, after an hour the server said \"the kitchen must have lost the order\", and that was it! No one cared, no one made an effort to make it right or offer a solution! Poor service, poor management, so very sad."}
{"text":"This is the best new mid to low priced Italian restaurants in all of Phoenix Valley. The pastas are made fresh daily the sauce is fresh, all handmade meatballs. All I can say.....the food here is over the top, the best meatballs in Arizona. They've only been open for about a week and I've been there 3 times. The service is the best, more like a fine dining experience. Chef Joey knows Italian...."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place we had driven by it looked on Yelp and the food looks good so we decided to try it. But we were a table of five God-fearing me late afternoon 3 o'clock. Our server was very friendly and informative. The food was OK not the best and I would not go back to food unfortunately. There's just too many other better places where The food is more authentic. This place definitely tasted like a fox concepts restaurant or a glorified hipster macaroni grill. 

We had a good time but I think the thing that bothers us the most is we had it appetizer board and several drinks that we On having to ask to have someone remove the food in excess dishes from our table.  I probably saw I handful of other bussers but we continually had to ask for a waters to be refilled the place to be cleared.

And to top it off we were sitting next to the hostess desk and the manager was telling the hostess we have a VIP from Mayo coming in we need to make sure this table is taken care of. Will shouldn't every guest be treated like a VIP.  Especially when we're spending over $200 for a tab.

Sorry this is a one and done for us."}
{"text":"\"Editing\" this review because apparently the business likes to impose limitations on what consumers review...

I live out of town and went to this restaurant this same night with my parents.  The meal started out well, we had the arugula and prosciutto flatbread for an appetizer.  My mom's drink came out wrong, but she typically orders vodka martinis straight up so this is a common issue for her.  The server quickly corrected the drink order and all was well.

Then there was dinner.  My dad's food came out cold, the first meatball he bit into was literally cold.  He ordered the mafalde pasta with vodka cream sauce and the eggplant parm meatballs, it was by far the best entree after it was returned hot.  My mom is not into big flavors and ordered a basic spaghetti with Tamaso's meatballs, and marinara.  Given she is receptive even to pepper as being spicy, it was perfect for her.  I ordered the gnocchi with truffle sauce and aged steak meatballs.  It was awful.  I felt like I was eating pot roast in brown gravy, literally the truffle sauce was brown.  I hate adding spices to a recipe that should stand alone, but I requested chili flakes to get through my meal.  As someone who has eaten gnocchi with truffle sauce while in Italy, maybe my expectations are too high, or maybe the Sicilian Butcher needs to focus on what it does well.  

For $130 for 3 mediocre entrees, 6 drinks, and an appetizer, the service fell far below what I would expect... at least the host held the door for us on the way out.  I watched our server walk away from the POS with three checkbooks in hand, several minutes after having requested our check.  After making eye contact with me, she returned to the POS to enter several additional orders and to print our check.  She then came to the table and apologized for \"everyone wanting to leave (her) at the same time.\"  I really wanted to like this place, I hope these are just growing pains and there will be better days."}
{"text":"I am from New York and I live out here during the winter. Decided to take my husband there for dinner, our neighbors had told us about this place. We wanted to have a couple cocktails before we sat down for dinner. It was quite crowded. There was a lovely young lady at the bar, Courteney. I cannot tell you how wonderful this young lady was too us! The bar was very crowded and I sat while my husband stood, as there was not enough room. She ran that area like a pro and with the utmost in customer service. I have eaten at many, many restaurants and customer service, to me, is more important than the food. People go back to restaurants for the service..not the food. You have a diamond in this young lady...it was Courteney and another young lady. They were so very busy and as my husband and I watched her tackle the rush, she was amazing!!!! Smiled, was attentive and knew how to keep the customer happy!! Hats off to this young lady!! We were not able to stay for dinner as it was getting too late. We will be back....!!"}
{"text":"Oh Yeah! Knocking it out of the park. Good food great atmosphere. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!  We went on a Sunday afternoon.  First, the place itself is really cool.  They have a large glass case with different salumi and cheeses(?) and hanging meat cleavers.  The bar is 1/2 inside and 1/2 outside.  They also have a nice patio in front of the restaurant and one on the side.  We sat at the bar.  The bartenders were nice and funny.  They have a great and varied menu but the meatballs are the star.  You choose your meatball type, your sauce, and your bottom (e.g. pasta, risotto, polenta, etc.). They have other stuff too... salads, appetizers, flatbreads... something for everyone, really. On the happy hour menu (happy hour is all day, every day btw) we saw that they had a polenta board and a bottle of wine for $19.  We thought, what the heck? Lets try it.  I'm so glad we did.  First, we weren't sure which wine we wanted so the bartender told us to try them all... and we did :-).  We chose our wine and anxiously awaited our polenta board.  So, the polenta board is literally a long (about 2ft) board that has a pile of mascarpone and parmigiano-reggiano polenta in the middle, topped with 4 large house meatballs, and marinara sauce.  The board was also served with grilled bread.  OMG, everything was so delicious.  I was not expecting anything so good for $20.  I can hardly wait to go back and try their other meatballs, pastas, sauces, charcuterie boards, and burrata.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere!!  Go:-)"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. AWESOME food. Our waitress was nice. Gets crazy busy! They need a bigger space to accommodate the crowds. (Good for them!) We were practically sitting at the front door to eat so that was a little awkward. I'd go back though!"}
{"text":"We're foodies and we eat out several nights each week. We love to try new restaurants. Tonight we tried the Sicilian Butcher, but all six of us were disappointed with both food and management. All concept; no substance. It doesn't live up to the quality and flavor of Tomaso restaurants. Our server was great. The hostess was sweet, but in over her head -- not properly trained in getting guests efficiently accommodated. It's about poor training by her manager, not about her. We had called ahead and she took our name to hold a table. We arrived and waited more than 45 minutes. During our wait, at least four groups of adjoining tables opened up. Any of them could accommodate 6 by being pushed together. But as we waited and waited, we watched the hostess seat table after table of four, ignoring that they could have pushed two tables together for us. After the first 25 mins, we had to call attention to this grievous inattention. Were we invisible? But we still had to wait and watch additional diners be seated at tables that should have been ours. The manager never seemed to care. He walked by us repeatedly without checking on our seating or comfort, ignoring our inquiring stares. Finally they pushed together two tables -- which they could have easily done 30 minutes earlier. Ah yes... Finally the food! The eggplant meatballs were almost entirely breading, no eggplant flavor, and I think I finally found one half inch or smaller piece of eggplant within the flavorless mush, which made me search more avidly for another. No luck. They had no distinctive flavor at all, washed out in bland breadcrumbs. The arrabiata sauce was fiery but flavorless. Another guest described their marinara sauce as curiously overspiced, and yet flavorless -- \"the pepper killed any subtlety in the taste. Another described their turkey meatballs as \"just ok.\" The homemade pasta, devoid of flavor. On the positive side, the salads were good, with fresh ingredients. Again, did the manager care? He passed by during dinner with a perfunctory, \"how was everything?\" By the time I looked up to reply, he had continued past. I guess he didn't care any more about our food than about our seating. And by now, we didn't care for being there. 
A manager is there to ensure a great experience. No one offered us the smallest accommodation- no apology, no kind word; nor a dessert or appetizer. No effort was made to show us appreciation or to inspire us to give them a second chance. Most of us try a restaurant only once. The overall experience draws us back again and again -- Or it drives us away. After we had paid our check (still with no words of consideration or apology from the manager), I told our server (who was caring and sharp) about the characterless food. Was there even a head chef? I asked her to tell the chef so that he/she can up their food game. We have many choices of places to spend our precious time and money. Tonight at Sicilian Butcher, a gracious and delicious experience was had by none in our group."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful! It has a fun atmosphere with great food. We went when there was a DJ playing on a Saturday night. Our waiter was Gino, and he was great!! He gave us great recommendations. The gnocchi is amazing. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch excellent service & food was ambrosia! Nice ambiance & beautiful patio-family owned (Tomaso's )"}
{"text":"Excellent! So excited to have a new, good restaurant in the area! Randi, our waitress, was lovely. She walked us through the menu and helped us settle on a yummy turkey meatball risotto. So many yummy options - definitely coming back to try them all!"}
{"text":"Awesome time, great service and food.  Nothing wrong with sitting outside with a charcuterie board, meatballs, and eggplant.  Service was warm and friendly.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Food was the best and service was on point. Great new spot, can't wait to go back. Jeff the manager checked on us, our server made sure we were well taken care of. 5 stars all around. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely evening with 6 of us on a Friday night. Very busy, but a short 30 minute wait. Lots of heaters on the patio to stand under. We were sat at a round table, perfect for visiting. Our waiter Gino is by far the best waiter we've ever had anywhere. He's Italian, funny and gave superior service. Everybody's food was perfect! They are known for their meatballs and they didn't let us down! We can highly recommend the Carbonara sauce!"}
{"text":"New place in town! Went with my foodie friends and the wait can be long so if at all possible get reservations. The food was good but nothing special. I am just happy to have a new option on this side of town."}
{"text":"What an amazing place.   Was there last weekend for a bday party and exceptional service from Gino, food was to die for and the cocktails coming from the bar were out of bounds.  

Will be back for sure, need a location in the gilbert/chandler area!!"}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service.  We have been twice and would need a guarantee of good service to go back. Both times we ordered food and waited forever to be served. The fist time we repeatedly watched our food and drinks go by because the e servers couldn't find the right table. 

We pulled the manager aside and told him the issue. He acknowledged the challenge with a new and busy restaurant so we went back and same issue. Either the management cannot figure out how to solve the problem or the problem will get solved for them as customers get turned off.

My hope is that they fix the issue because it is a great location with a terrific concept and genuinely good food.  Normally food trumps all for me but the wait was so bad the second time we skipped dessert because we couldn't deal with more watching our food go by."}
{"text":"This food was AMAZING!!  It's our first time here and so good. Saturday night so we waited about an hour but it went by fast with the awesome wine I had. This place is great, the patio is great, and the meat hook lights are the best. The pasta is home made and we had the sausage which was to die for. My husband loves the Italiano cocktail with the smoke!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great idea! I have always loved meatballs but I never order them at restaurants.  They are always touted as the boring choice for those diners that can't find anything else on the menu to order.  The Sicilian Butcher puts them center stage and they are amazing! The pasta is also terrific and very fresh.

I was a little disappointed by the mushroom truffle sauce.  It was good but the truffle was non-existent.  The arrabiata sauce was better but nothing fantastic.  I will keep trying the sauces until I find one I love."}
{"text":"First time coming here.
Everything was fine, but the were huge loved the spaghetti and meatballs and the one with mushroom sauce super yummy"}
{"text":"Our first visit was good, food and service nice. However, our second visit was absolutely horrible! We were seated and forgotten, then again after ordering wine! It went downhill from there. The food took forever and service was horrible. A manager made up for it with complimentary dessert, which we took home with us. 
Our third visit on a Sunday about 5:00pm was a nightmare! Really busy, food took forever, and the Eggplant Parmesan was barely warm after setting out while other meals were prepared. This place has potential but every time the server says they're short help! So, why don't they get their act together and give the service their food deserves! I want to love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We went for restaurant week and it did not disappoint. We had a group of 5 and everyone was raving about how good the food was we left stuffed. I will definitely be back to try the other menu items. They also have a great patio if you are looking to sit outside."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the environment was lively. The lump crap and shrimp meatballs with gnocchi were to die for. I highly recommend this place if looking for homemade pasta!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the entire valley!!!  I was thoroughly impressed with the service, ambiance and the attention to detail of the menu.  Well done!  Ask for Igor.  He is right off the boat and couldn't be more of a pleasure."}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is great! During peak season it can be packed mid week! It is very pricey. The pasta is perfection! We would return more routinely if prices were a bit lower. Hope the offer a special summer menu!"}
{"text":"Very good neighbor restaurant...we went for Happy Hour, food and atmosphere are fantastic."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for a new local spot after being let down by Modern Grove's disappointing food and terrible service. We anxiously awaited the opening and finally saw what looked like a grand opening so we walked over the following weekend around 2:00, but they didn't open until later apparently. The hours were not posted and we couldn't find any info online. Tried again the following weekend for dinner. Sat outside. They fixed up the patio nicely and it doesn't feel like you are sitting in a parking lot anymore. The food and service are lacking. We've been back 2 more times and still not impressed. The meatballs were cold. The salads are bland. Bruschetta has odd toppings. The wait is usually at least 30 min because they don't take reservations and there is really no place to wait which is awkward. You would think the owners would have this restaurant thing down by now..."}
{"text":"Service was horrible and way overpriced. Better off saving your money and eating Chef Boyardee !"}
{"text":"So delicious! The food was very authentic and fresh. Don't leave this restaurant without trying the meatballs! Can't stop thinking about this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent Experience!
Im not gonn review individual dishes, this is a case of its all good so pick anything on the menu.
Obvuiusly they are known for their meatballs and pastas, for good reason. Excellent flavorous and perfect home made pasta. The environment is great, modern contemporary twist on Italian decor, killer patio area and a great bar ( inside /outside bar seating.)
Great experience overall."}
{"text":"After all the hype & anticipation, I would love to write a great review ~ except when we drove there today (Sunday) at 2 PM, we (along with a few others) were told they didn't open until 3 PM ~ accordingly to Yelp! they should be open 11 AM - 10 PM.  For a place so new, this is not the kind of misstep you should have ~ not sure when we'll be in the area again, but we won't be making a special trip just to find them closed."}
{"text":"Best Carbonara to be found in the valley. The deconstructed cannoli is to die for and the service is top notch. Will definitely be back ~ this place brings back memories of the mom & pop restaurants in South Philly & Jersey"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meatballs, however they needed to be hotter.  I like that they offer  HH everyday.. every hour in the bar area.  Great atmosphere,"}
{"text":"Well we decided to give this new location a try. We placed a order to go.  We were told 10 mins to pick up. It was actually 20 and they seemed quite unorganized.  Pick up the food and when got it home we were shocked. First we ordered a grilled cheese. The menu purposes to have ham, Marino sauce  n mozzarella cheese pressed on Italian bread. What we got was bread n a spattering of cheese. It was sad. Spaghetti was ordered and it was so matted it appeared it hAd been sitting for some time and sauce was thrown on it to make it look good.  The cheese board was disappointing as the meat Was mushy and honestly not edible. French fries were good. The Tony's dry aged steak meatball taste like store bought frozen meatball. Very bland with no seasoning. All in all a very disappointing meal which didn't have all the ingredients in it as described on their menu. Won't soon return unless things change there. So disappointing to say the least. See pictures"}
{"text":"Place was great. At first I thought it was too fancy for my attire but the staff treated me and my nieces like we were regulars. Friendly staff and the owner came up to our table to see how we were. The food was delicious. If I visit Arzonia again, I am defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"Wow. Unbelievable. I can't believe we didn't find this gem sooner. It's owned by Tomaso's and you get all that goodness. The charcuterie boards are amazing. We had a meats and cheese board. Then you select a meatball, a sauce and then a base. Meatballs are traditional or eggplant or shrimp and crab. My husband selected Tomaso's and I had Uncle Arthur's. Fabulous. He had Sunday Sugo sauce on pasta and I had amatriciana sauce over creamy polenta. Delicious! Dessert we tried the affogatto which has cotton candy on top. Amazing. And we had the deconstructed cannoli. Yum! Prices are great and service is stellar. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!
Delicious place, affordable and great staff!!!! The best thing about this place are the cheese boards and bruschetta!!! Soo yummy!! The Reverse Cannoli is LIFE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome afternoon at The Sicilian Butcher. Had awesome 5 foot board. The dessert was truly amazing. The stuff was awesome taking care of our large group on short notice. Place has a great menu with a different twist. This is my second time and a big fan. Love the picture of the Original Sicilian."}
{"text":"We LOVED the Sicilian Butcher. Service is just as good as the food! We ordered everything our server Gino suggested and he was spot on. We loved the mozzarella board, bruschetta, and the best gnocchi you'll ever have. Gino was excellent and really made our dining experience! We will definitely be back and love that it's a quick bike ride from our house! Highly recommend this restaurant and be sure to make a reservation, this place is always packed."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely loved this place. We did not make reservations we were told there was a 45 min wait. We were invited to sit at the bar and so glad we did. We ordered delicious drinks and appetizers. Everybody was so nice and friendly. We only waited a few mins and our table was ready in the patio as we asked if possible. Our appetizers and drinks were brought up to our table. We ordered more food and wine. Everyting was absolutely delicious. The service was great, the patio set up was fantastic. We will be definitely going back. We had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Italian food don't go here. The $16 \"make your own pasta\" was very bland. The bruschetta was not enjoyable (I personally would go to Postino for the amount and quality over this) and we walked away spending $50 for two people on what was the quality of a $30- meal. Waiter was never at or by our table and when the food came out it was cold. Super disappointed!"}
{"text":"Super busy on a Thursday night, still received great service and the food exceeded our expectations and was reasonably priced.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give it a 5 but service started strong then fizzled to a 2 or 3. Server explained the menu, highlighted some options, then disappeared, took forever w dessert menu that we just wanted to get home. Too bad, sounded good. 

Now onto the good, which is why still 4 stars. The food was great. Had the Uncle Aurthers on risotto with marinara sauce. I'm picky w sauce and it was so good, only complaint is I wanted more lol. We split that dish and the meat and cheese board. It was so much food but so good. I think this place is great to share plates. There were a few things I want to go back to try. Think I'll bring more people. I just hope service improves. It was a bummer bc now I'm wanting dessert!!"}
{"text":"Great experience and wonderful meal.  Loved the meat and cheese board.  Big variety and quality.  Nice variety of happy hour wines from Italy.  The gourmet meatballs with a variety of options, sauces and bottoms were unique and amazing.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight with some friends. None of us had ever been here before, and we were all quite impressed. We dined out on the patio, and everything from dinner to dessert tasted amazing. We all remarked how fabulous this place was, and we need to try more. Great vibe, great service, and GREAT food. This place is like nothing we have ever experienced before. It's \" MEATBALL MANIA! \""}
{"text":"Rarely give 5 stars .. starters Christie you rock.  Seriously best employee of the year hope y'all appreciate what a gem you have there.  Atmosphere is great food fantastic.  Very excited that you are so close to our home.   One of the best dining experiences in some time.  Great food and overall experience must go."}
{"text":"Food= A 
Atmosphere = A+
Service= A++ 

Really good time and food here on a random Wednesday night ( Place was hopping) Came in with 2 young boys who both loved their ( Huge for kids menu! ) meals. 

I had the gluten free pasta with a spicy red sauce... very nice.  Side note: Waitress knew precisely what I could and couldnt have being celiac...  and was very sure of herself in that regard. Which I like. 

Wife had a meat board and gave it high marks.. couldnt even come close to eating it all.

Service was stellar as I already mentioned. The Owner/GM came around and greeted us and he is a great personality whom our boys got a real kick out of. 

Cant beat the vibe either.. even for a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Pick your own meatballs and pasta???? COUNT ME IN! 

We LOVE this place. All the pasta is made in-house and the meatballs are beyond amazing. 

The service is *almost* as great as the food, but honestly I don't think anyone can beat homemade spinach and ricotta stuffed gnocchi.....

I would literally eat here everyday if calories weren't a problem. 

The one ~minor~ critique I have, I wish the yummy bruschetta was cut into FOUR pieces instead of two so I could enhance the optimal sharing ratio. Plz."}
{"text":"The restaurant was huge, great outdoor seating available with misters.  The food was great, so bring your appetite"}
{"text":"Having lived in Arizona for 8 years before moving away, any time I come back to visit, I have a short list of must-visit restaurants (most of which I've already reviewed on Yelp). This is the first time I'm adding a new restaurant to that list. I enjoyed The Sicilian Butcher that much. Judging by how busy they were late on a Sunday evening, I'm guessing many people feel the same way. I went with my wife and my in-laws. They had been there previously and raved about it to us. 

The entree premise is a three-part selection:
1) Choose your meatball (there are about 8 types to choose from, if this is your first visit, go with Tomaso's or Uncle Arthur's)
2) Choose your sauce (9 choices here)
3) Choose your base (house made pastas, risotto, gnocchi, polenta or salad)

My wife and I decided to each order a different combo and share. I had the Tomaso's meatballs with carbonara sauce atop mafalde (ribbon pasta). She chose Uncle Arthur's with the sugo (bolognese) and gnocchi. Both were outstanding. The gnocchi were fluffy, not dense and sticky. The meatballs were delicious and the pasta was al dente. Seriously, who doesn't love house-made pasta?

As an appetizer, the four of us ordered two Flora's salads. The salad was a great example of letting nice ingredients speak for themselves. It was not over-dressed.

Portions were generous. At $16 and $18 for the meatball entrees, we all had leftovers to bring with us. I thought it was an exceptional value.

The food definitely deserved 5 stars, and so did the service. Gino made us feel like long-time regulars as opposed to first timers. He made a great wine recommendation also. 

When food and service are this good, expect a restaurant to be around for a long time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's not hard to give the food here 5 stars. What stood out the most was the 5 star service from start to finish. From the mom's t we walked in with our 11 month old for a date night, we were treated like family. Gino was our server and he rocked it. He was attentive to our baby and made recommendations on things we could share with her. He made us feel like we were cousins. We felt like we mattered even though the restaurant was slammed service stayed on par. We got to meet Frankie the new GM. You would have never known it was his secind night. I'm looking forward to bringing friends and family back. Gino you're awesome thank you for an awesome evening."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Stumbled across it accidentally and it was a highlight of our day. We started with the cured meats board that not only looked amazing but tasted  incredible. They actually cure all the meats in the restaurant which is nice. For our entree we got the bruschetta board and split the NY meatballs with spaghetti. 

We sat outside and the patio area was one of the best patio settings I've seen in Phoenix. Next Time we are going to sit inside to get a sneak peak of that meat wall!"}
{"text":"By far the best Italian place I've had inPhoenix! Enjoyed this immensely. We had multiple dishes and they were all fantastic! The portion size was very big. The service was very good, despite how crowded they place was - which was pretty surprising. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was such a great surprise. The meatballs were amazing, the arabiata sauce was delicious, and they even made their own pasta. I'm very picky about Italian restaurants and will only eat at a few. This place checked all of the boxes and is a great casual spot. 

Super impressed."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!  Came on a Friday night around 7:30pm w a group of 5...we were seated inside immediately (could have also sat outside).  Both were very busy but we still got a table, which is always nice!  I will say, inside was a bit loud, but we expected that.  Decor is fabulous; trendy, clean, modern.  Service was good, our waitress was very sweet.  Between us all we ordered: charred octopus (my fav of the night...served w a pickled fennel salad), two buckets of balls, one w the truffle sauce and the other w the arrabiata sauce (yum!), the butchers board, a charcuterie board (loved the cheeses and pickled veggies on this board), and a bruschetta board.  Everything was FANTASTIC!!  We also had wine and beer...I felt the prices were incredibly reasonable and even learned every day is happy hour if you sit at the bar ($19 for bottle and board!!) 

By far my favorite new place, locally...less than two miles from my house!!  I will be a regular moving forward!!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Wide selection of meatballs and they were great.  Friendly service. Looked crowded the first time I went but we ended up only waiting about 5 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"I really liked this place and will be back many more times. Very nice patio dining area with plenty of umbrellas for shade. The indoor dining area is very open with great decor.  The food was great with lots of variety. Service was very pleasant and always ready to help. I highly recommend this place. We were there for lunch and look forward to returning for dinner."}
{"text":"WOW, just WOW!! This is a new place and it's unbelievable how efficient and amazing!! I can't even describe it well enough to do it justice. From the amazing servers,  management,  table assistants,  to the good. Just one very awesome experience.  We chose to share a meat board and then got salads with a side of meatballs. If you're in to Keto, its perfect. Because of Keto,  we didn't try the pasta but it looked amazing.  This place is a MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic ambience and great food.  One of my favorite dishes is the eggplant parm appetizer...so yummy.  Also love the drink choices! The Italiano and its presentation are super fun and tasty, too."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, not spectacular. Service is good and waitstaff is friendly. It's a good addition to the neighborhood as do many chains exist in this area."}
{"text":"2nd time here the other night...WOW, no kid in tow so I was able to enjoy the happy hour!  Bottle and board for $19 and the food was out in under 10 mins steaming hot!! I can't even begin to share my overall excitement... this place has wowed me both times and I can't wait to return:)"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious. We were visiting from CA. This was the best meal of our trip. So many types of meatballs and so juicy. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very nice time! Bartender was awesome! He really made the visit noteworthy. Would definitely go back and sit at the bar! Food was good."}
{"text":"We had been trying to come since opening. Our daughter had prom and we wanted to come see everyone.  It was worth the wait!!  The attention to customer service was spot on. The food was plentiful and seriously flavorful. The portion are so large we could not finish them. 
We started with the meat and cheese platter. The prosciutto, salami and cheese  was authentic tasting. We also had the polenta fries. One word- AMAZING! And not just one, but two dipping sauces. 
My husband had the Sicilian meatballs and spaghetti, the daughter had fettuccine and I had the stuffed gnocchi with the truffle mushroom sauce . It was all delicious. Really lived up to my very high bar of Italian food as I have a brother-in-law who is from Italy and would spoil us with his cooking."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food was amazing, dessert even better. So many good things on the menu. I am so happy to have this place in the neighborhood much needed and so much better than Modern Grove that was there prior. My only complaint is the music... elevator smooth jazz. It needs to go !"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place for a while. Last week we tried it with some friends of ours, we were not disappointed! We tried 3 of the \"buckets of balls\" with the shrimp and crab, Tomaso's original, and the beef and sausage meatballs. We also had one of the boards with it. We all tried different pastas, everyone was very satisfied with their choices. The rose sangria's were delicious and went down easy. The wait staff was awesome and \"Gino\" the owner came around several times to make sure that we were all happy and satisfied. 

We went again this week, and tried the \"Italian Mule\" which is a group drink, it is delicious. This time we tried the Uncle Arthur's and eggplant parm meatballs, both perfect. The meatballs are extremely filling and dense, but moist and creamy depending on the type you select. The pasta was cooked to perfection. We had the pana cotta for dessert and it was to die for. 

Bottom line is this place is a gem, it's local and in my neighborhood. The vibe is good, the food does not disappoint and service is outstanding. This is a our new \"place\". We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just ate at this restaurant for the first time. It's in my neighborhood and I avoided it for a long time because the restaurant that used to occupy this spot was so poorly managed. What an incredible surprise. The food was outstanding. I had the eggplant meatballs and they were off the charts. Wine is $5 a glass all day every day at the bar. What a value. Ambiance was great and Cassy our server took such good care of us. The manager even stopped by our table twice to check on us. I will definitely be returning to this neighborhood bistro. Way to go Sicilian Butcher!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been meaning to try this place since it opened up, and we finally made it in! Our expectations were high because the place is always packed but unfortunately we had an odd experience. We walked in and were sat by who I think was a server there. We sat and a backserver immediately came over to fill our waters and was very kind. About 7 or 8 minutes pass before a server stops by to apologize and explain that they had made cuts for the night and no-one was sure who was gonna take our table..odd but fine, he took our drink order and a few more minutes went by and our \"real\" server stopped by and introduced himself and said he would be back with our drinks. We ordered and that was that. Server was awkward and impersonal but nice none the less. Arincini were traditionally prepared and crispy on the outside but pretty bland. My boyfriend said his pasta was good and my polenta with meatballs were also okay......but nothing blew us away like expected. Ambiance and patio were nice though. We may try again in hopes it was an off night but overall strange first experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I heard about this place from a friend and decided to check it out.  Being of Italian heritage, I like to check out the latest Italian places in town.  We loved it.  The charcuterie is awesome.  We then took my parents back for Father's Day and they cannot stop talking about how much they enjoyed it.  The atmosphere is great and the owners checked in on us a few times and were great with my older parents.  I highly recommend The Sicilian Butcher.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meatball choices are great and quick tasty but the flat bread meals are over salted. Overall a nice place to dine and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Outstanding concept. Love the flexibility to create my own meatball dish. Great flavors. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten there a few times with friends and have found  the food to be very good.  The only serious issue that I have is with the wait service, it is very slow and not very attentive.  They could use a couple of more wait-service people.  I recommend sitting outside as it is very noisy inside due to very poor acoustics.  But, all in all, give them a shot; I do not think you will be disappointed, especially in the food. HMMM, meatballs!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place mixed reviews after hearing so much hype about it. The environment is great, very trendy, with a good mix of outdoor/indoor seating. 

We started with a bruschetta board - a mix of 4 different bruschettas. They were all fabulous! I highly recommend the dates/bacon combo as well as the brie/fig jam. Delicious!

The main course consisted of dry aged steak balls, arrabiatta sauce & mafalde pasta. The sauce was excellent. Be warned! It is spicy. The pasta was good. My friend ordered the spiedini pork cutlet, vodka cream sauce, and gnocchi pasta. The meatball & spiedini were both dry. The gnocchi pasta was doughy. 

I'd go back again, but order something different."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Definitely a 5 - although on a Sunday they were out of prosecco and cranberry juice (Walgreens is in the parking lot) - the service was abysmal. 25 minutes for first acknowledgement of the table, and on average 20 minutes to get a drink. We loved the food!!"}
{"text":"I'm so torn on what I feel about the place. I recognize it's only been open for a couple weeks, but I feel The Sicilian Butcher has a lot of promise but a lot of kinks.

It's a really good menu on paper. Yet certain things might be out when you're there. For me, it was the Arrabiatta sauce and the Crispy Cuttlefish. I was told that was gone for a while, but what is really a \"while\" after two weeks?

Apps we got were the arancini and the panelle fries. Though the arancini were very pretty, it was underwhelming for $4 per triangle - perhaps saffron was driving up the price? The panelle fries by comparison were a much better purchase - they ate almost like a fried tofu, and the sauce was a great sour kick.

Between the rest of the party and myself, our judgments were about the same for the main dish. The pasta was killer, the sauce was good, and the meatballs were okay. The meatballs are big, so I don't think $15 min is unjustified by any means. But when they're only okay, and you can get the pasta+sauce for $8.50, the cheaper option plus an app seems like the way to go.

Overall it seems like a great concept with an uneven execution. Nail on the coffin for losing the second star were the dining conditions. Staff was friendly, and a great open air vibe to the decor. Yet for some god awful reason, our table was surrounded by ~10 flies that went after us and our food. Some of the staff noticed too and helped with the shooing, but I didn't see other patrons have our problem. Maybe the corner booth is just cursed."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time on a Sunday night. We really enjoyed our dinner there. Gino, our waiter, was hilarious! He was knowledgable and funny. Definitely knows how to sell desserts!  
Our meals were a mixed bag. My husband had the Sicilian salad with chicken - he loved it! I had Bucket of Balls - Turkey with Carbonera sauce. Not a fan. Doesn't mean it wasn't good, the turkey flavor just didn't appeal to me personally. The Deconstructed Cannoli was FANTASTIC!
There were only two things that kept me from giving the Sicilian Butcher a five star rating; one,when this place is full, it's loud and two, I couldn't get my water glass refilled to save my butt. Petty, maybe, but important to me.  That being said, we will definitely be back with family and friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at the Sicilian butcher this week, when we were in town on business.  Though the place is new it seems to run like a well oiled machine, headed by a very nice and personable manager called andre.  The wait staff was knowledgeable, courteous and willing to please us and when the food came out, it made our trip worthwhile - it was outstanding.  The prices were reasonable, the portions were enough to fill our empty bellies and then some - my dog was very happy with what we brought home.  I recommend THE SICILIAN BUTCHER to anyone interested in a good atmosphere, good food, reasonable prices, and personable staff."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend in the patio area. My spaghetti and cream vodka sauce was a disappointment. The sauce tasted like flour and it was cold along with the over cooked spaghetti...BUT...the meatballs were incredible!  The meatballs  were so tasty the inferior pasta and sauce were a non issue. Salad and service were also outstanding. Will definitely go back for those meatballs."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I've tried a couple of different charcuterie boards and the one thing that wasn't appealing was the fried polenta. It had zero flavor and wasn't presented in an inventive way. I have tried the steak  meatball with truffle mushroom sauce and saffron risotto. Very good. Their salads are also delicious and I love the Sicilian Spritzer drink."}
{"text":"I originally RAVED and gave a 5 star review after my first visit here. I liked it so much that when my guests flew in, I told them all about the awesome restaurant I would be taking them to. I guess I should have noticed the other 1 star reviews sprinkled throughout all the rave ones because my second visit was a DISASTER! 
After being seated we waited over 10 minutes before I finally had to get up and ask the hostess if we could get a waiter. She apologized and explained that they were short on staff. When our waiter finally appeared, I could not help but feel for the poor guy and asked how many tables he was juggling. To my amazement, he said that only TWO waiters were covering the ENTIRE place! I watched as the hostess kept seating table after table despite the fact that the waiters clearly couldnt keep up. 
When our food finally came out,it was cold and the pasta was over cooked. I couldnt catch the waiters attention because both were running like chickens without heads. But the final nail in the coffin was when my guests wife reported that there wasnt any toilet tissue in the bathroom! 
Be warned that this place has A LOT of kinks to work out and I would think twice before recommending it just yet."}
{"text":"My wife and heard about The Sicilian Butcher and she loves meatballs and pasta so it sounded like a great idea. The homemade pasta and variety of meatballs are as advertised delicious. We started with a mozzarella caprese board followed by 3 pasta combination.  I had the ribeye steak meatballs with Mafalde wide noodles my wife had Uncle Arthur's Ny with Marinara and Mafalde.   
We also shared the eggplant stuffed meatballs with spinach stuffed gnocchi in a carbonara sauce with English peas and prosciutto very good. The portion size is generous we took a lot home which we will enjoy later."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place...you have too!  Ask for Bonnie she will take care of you!  Great food and atmosphere!  Happy hour everyday & all day!  The food is great...take time and enjoy some homemade food at very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The appetizers and bruschetta are reason enough to visit but don't miss out on the homemade pasta, meatballs and various sauces. The dessert is definitely not too shabby. I love the deconstructed cannoli."}
{"text":"I really liked our experience at the Sicilian Butcher! The temps outside were above 100, but we are crazy and decided to eat outside. With the misters and the shade, it was actually very nice! My meatball, was too meaty, but lol, its a meatball. :) The spinach stuffed gnocchi was unique and yummy. My son loved the spaghetti and meatballs from the kids menu and my husband thought the eggplant parmesan was good too. Service was awesome and the owner comes by to personally make sure everyone's enjoying their meal."}
{"text":"Great concept. Great service. Food was great. Truffle mushroom sauce on my meatballs was delicious. I wanted to take visiting family somewhere nice, unique with a great atmosphere and service and The Sicilian Butcher perfectly delivered! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our server and all of the staff were very kind! Their specialty is meatballs and they gave 3 per serving which I thought was plenty, then you got to pick your sauce and what you want under the balls. I think its creative and they were super good! Atmosphere is probably my favorite part. Really cute outdoor area! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a place you would come to again and again. Great food and a lot of choices. Staff was very friendly and on point. Better come early or expect a wait. Currently, my favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix. Also, a shout out to Derek for a job well done."}
{"text":"Wonderful Cheese Board, Charcuterie Board, Bruschetta, Gnocchi to die for!, Spaghetti w/meatballs/spicy marinara sauce!  Ordered a bottle of Etna Rosso - too light for the antipasta and switched to a bottle of Merlot which was perfect.  Yolanda, our server, was outstanding.  Desert was Affagotto and Taramisu!  Yolanda read the table well and realized we were there for a leisurely dining experience while keeping her eye on our table and refilling water and wine.  Enjoyed a nice conversation with a young man near the wine cellar when I went to inspect wines to choose a second bottle.  What a personable, polite young man he was.  We chatted a bit and I returned to our table.  He came to our table with a business card for reference or to give to friends as a recommendation - maybe the owner's son?  This is my 4th visit since they opened Dec 1, 2017.  This place is a neighborhood gem.  Noise level high, but that was OK with me, and after 5 minutes the noise level wasn't an issue.  Staff is both professional and friendly.  Manager stopped by to inquire how we were enjoying our meal - love that touch!!!  Love, love the flavor of the wood grilled bread that accompanies the boards and upon which the Bruschetta is served.  Next time I will insist my daughter brings her wallet with her ID!!!!."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying I will definitely be back soon. Holy crap was this place good. 

From walking in the front door I knew I'd love this place. It smelled soooo good and we were treated immediately. We sat outside because it was so nice outside. Our server came to us quickly and found out it was our first time so gave us a quick tour of the menu. I'm sad that we just came for a snack because the other meals sounded amazing. 
We ordered the cazzilli appetizer and meatball flatbread to share and wasn't not disappointed. The cazzilli was so good my eyes rolled in the back of my head. The marinara was clearly just made and it was incredible. Shortly after our flatbread came and it was just as amazing as the appetizer. The chunks of meatballs made me really want to come back and try the bucket of balls on their menu. 

I am so glad to have tried this place. I'm really picky about my Italian food cause it's my favorite and I will definitely come back here. Everyone was super friendly and the food was incredible. I can't wait to come back. I've been talking about this place all week."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place and picked this place for Valentine's Day , but unfortunately everything was bland. My boyfriend and I both agreed that the sauces and meatballs barely had any flavor (we both ordered different meals). The pasta is way over priced for a meal that was nothing special. Very disappointing and won't be back. Only reason I gave two stars was for the service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had dinner there the other day and loved the food, service, venue and the owner was very friendly. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"We just went back after having some issues with some Saint Joseph cake around Easter time. The managers read our previous review and responded quickly to take of it. They gave us a gift card and this time we tried dinner there. My Dad and I enjoyed the meatballs and pasta very very much. Excellent flavor and a fresh homemade taste ! We will definitely go back and look forward to that day that won't come soon enough."}
{"text":"The food was good and our waiter was great, but the restaurant management was horrible. We had to wait for over 30 minutes while there was plenty of open tables. We ordered an app which they took to the wrong table (wait staff doesn't deliver the food) and it took nearly 40 minutes to get the app.  They ran out of many of the red wines."}
{"text":"Stopped tonight for a late snack and was really impressed with this new place. Our server, Emad was very attentive and made some great suggestions after answering our many questions. We had the Sicilian meatballs and a flatbread that was delicious. What a nice addition to our neighborhood. The outdoor area is very nice although we chose to eat indoors. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Loved the boards. Loved the meatballs. Loved the service. Loved the atmosphere. Think I liked this place? You will too"}
{"text":"3/2018 So, I need to amend my review.  We went there with a party of 8 for our 30th Anniversary.  Time to celebrate and spend money. Bam - slap us down to reality!  We were prepared to wait for a table since they insanely don't take reservations for large parties.  No big deal.  What was a big deal was the horrific 3 hours it took for the meal to be over.  Waitress took 20 minutes to come to table and all-told it was about 45 minutes to get our drinks.  Appetizer took about an hour!  We had one round of drinks and weren't asked again.  My elderly Mom ordered a 2nd glass of wine and after 25 minutes I finally found the manager and begged for the drink since she kept asking.  Not sure what was going on - perhaps they were short cooks.  Fine, but the manager or at least waitress should have explained the hold up.  

30 years only comes around once.  My memory of that evening is sad instead of happy.

I used to tell everyone to go here, but other people have said they have the same experience.

*********************************************

What can I say that others haven't?  This is a cute place with indoor and outdoor seating.  The decorations are warm and inviting, both inside and out.  

The wait staff is very attentive and knowledgeable.  He listened to what each of us (6) were interested in and made recommendations.  I had pasta the night before (guess I should have read the menu of this place that my friend recommended before we went) so I wanted to create a different flavor.  

The concept is great, choose from a selection of meatballs, sauces and base.  I chose the Tomaso's sicilian meatball with Truffle mushroom sauce over a base of creamy polenta.  Y'all it was heaven on earth.  Can you say meatloaf and mashed potatoes italian style???  The leftovers were just as good.  My other dinner companions loved what they got.  The desserts were just okay, although I am a sugar fiend and pretty particular.  

We will be back - to try their 5' long spectacular assortment of appetizers."}
{"text":"DELISH meatballs and bruschetta! Amazingly friendly service, wonderful birthday lunch"}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow service and ineptitude. Waited an hour for meatballs. MEATBALLS. Then they come out with the wrong order. Another sub par attempt to create vibe when the cornerstones of service and quality control are simply overlooked. There are tons of better options within a stones throw."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! We went last Friday night and it was almost an hour wait. Well worth it. We spent the time having drinks in the bar before dinner. Daniel was our bartender and he was great! Our server was Kaitlyn, she was extremely knowledgeable on all the menu items, very efficient and sweet. The food was fantastic. We started off with arancini balls, meat and cheese plates and some bruschetta. We were not disappointed. It seems they specialize in \" balls\" here. They have all kind of meatballs, shrimp and crab, lamb, pork and beef, beef and lamb, eggplant parmesan and I'm kn
ow I'm missing several others. Then you pick what you want it served over. I had the polenta it was absolutely delicious but they also have several different kinds of house-made pastas and you can put it over salad if you'd like. The next step is you pick your sauce you can choose from marinara, pesto,  vodka cream sauce and and many others. Everything came out in a timely fashion and hot. That's important to me because I like my food on the verge of burning my palate LOL! We finished with dessert which was equally amazing. Our table had affogato, cheesecake and panna cotta. I highly recommend this place and everything about it."}
{"text":"Bottle and board for $20 and it's super generous. Huge meatballs served on top of polenta with baguette on side. Don't stop there as they have gluten free hand made pasta and it's delish. You can order a bucket of meatballs to share or just make that your main course. It's paired with a sauce  of your choice. It's busy because they just opened so come early or come with a party of ten and you can make a reservation. Delish"}
{"text":"We had the rice ball appetizer, which was good. This was followed by the Sicilian meatballs, sauce and fresh pasta. Very flavorfull. Alcohol prices a little steep. $10 house Pinot Grigio and $8 draft IPA. Ouch."}
{"text":"We kept passing this place and noticing how busy it always was so we decided to stop in. So glad we did. It will definitely not be the last time. The charred octopus was perfect with the fennel salad. The lump crab and shrimp meatballs with parmesan cream sauce was wonderful. My son was in heaven with his sausage mb and arrabiata sauce over pasta and Villa Pozzi cabernet. Great energy. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Sicilian Butcher twice now and I have enjoyed my lunch both times! I love the polenta charcuterie board with turkey meatballs and truffle mushroom sauce.  

The ambiance is wonderful and they have a fantastic outdoor patio area. 

Great wine list and the service is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I am regular at the Butcher, well went for lunch the other day, and a bit disappointed.  #1 I asked for olives which I normal do and they brought olives and a loaf of bread (NEW) tasty but when  a got the $12 bill I was taken back a bit, expected $2 , like always.  Then the margarita was not good at all, and I have good ones here before.  We both ordered the flar breads and didnt care for them at all. (our mistake), TOO  bready.  Now the sugo meatballs wee great."}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoints.  Good fresh food every time.   The mozzarella board is great. Charred bread is something you can't get in AZ often.   But the magic is in the balls- I've had sausage with fennel, the shrimp crab, steak , and both of the more traditional meat balls.  All very good.   They give you three meatballs (you guys could get away with just portioning two for your price point I think) and I can never finish them all since I have to save room for dessert (affogoto with cotton candy.  Yes please!).  But don't be fooled by the balls- the pasta and sauce choices are just as much of a star. Happy hour is a great deal and the charcuterie board can feed a whole office.  Drinks are well made and fairly priced.   Oh and there's parking galore!   Right off the highway down Tatum and you'll find this gem.  Escape the madness of old town and give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed.    

Honestly the best part is seeing the pride in the owners and managers and their team- they want our experience as the customer to be great.   I commend them on a great restaurant, great food, great ambiance, and great service."}
{"text":"So many amazing things about this new restaurant, I don't know where to begin.  The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is awesome and the staff, they are fabulous.  Gino, he was our waiter and he was so friendly and gracious, he made our evening great.  
I will be back for sure when I visit AZ.  Joey and Gino thank you for a terrific evening."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! The meatballs and sauce were spot on! We need this on the west side in Peoria!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic restaurant! The food, service and atmosphere is awesome!! Blake and Frankie made the night extra special with their impeccable service and personalities! Our new favorite restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Giving this restaurant only one star and that is for the décor and setting.  Had such high hopes for this eagerly-anticipated new restaurant.  Went on a Friday evening with my husband, 2 kids and my parents early (4:30) to ensure getting a table without a wait.  Menu looked fantastic, so many options!  Our server, Jesus, took our order within a half hour and our appetizers came out pretty quickly.  Mozzarella in carozza - a normally hot dish with melted cheese inside - was ice cold!  After another hour, we still hadn't been served, yet the table next to us, who arrived well after we did, was almost done with their meal.  Jesus?  Nowhere to be found.  It took two separate times for one of us to get up from the table and find a manager to complain.  \"oh, it's coming...\" we were told each time.  A third time, another manager came over and apologized and said he'd \"get right on that.\"  Food came out shortly thereafter and three out of the six dishes were completely wrong.  On top of that, the pasta was severely undercooked (crunchy, in fact - maybe rushing our order? - but was told that was due to it being \"fresh pasta\" ?!?!) and the meatballs were rock hard.  Still no sign of Jesus.  At that point, so frustrated and with the kids starting to meltdown they were so hungry, my husband left with the kids and took them somewhere else to eat while my parents and I had to listen to apology and apology by a few of the managers, as they compped our \"meal.\"  My food was inedible and my father ate his meal anyway, even though it was not what he ordered.

While I understand new restaurants need to work out the kinks as far as service (and obviously, Jesus, our server, could care less about us as we never saw him after he took our order), I'd be willing to overlook that if the food was good.  I have to say, I cannot remember an experience in a restaurant that even comes close to how abysmal our experience was last Friday.  Such a beautiful space and outdoor area, so a real shame!"}
{"text":"Great food/concept.  Would be nice to order takeaway from this neighborhood restaurant, and make reservations.  Get it together Butcher!  You'll get more action from me and mine."}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance and high quality food. Highly recommend sitting outside at night. Our waitress, Yolanda, was such a rockstar and the owner is so kind and has an awesome accent. Try the gnocchi with vodka cream sauce!"}
{"text":"Amazing...simply amazing!  From the moment we walked in, every minute was perfect.  I am now addicted to the homemade pasta, meatballs and their traditional sauce.  I can't wait until I am there again!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! There is always a line at dinner so we came for lunch. Hands down one of the best meals in awhile! Got the Tomaso's Sicilian Meatballs with truffle mushroom sauce and gnoochi. Hubby got Uncle Arthur's NY meatballs with vodka sauce and ceasar salad. Everything was wonderful and left us stuffed. No room for dessert but saw some at other tables. Will have to come back and start with that next time!"}
{"text":"Very good and pleasantly surprised! I enjoyed the charcuterie board and my wife Flora's salad. We split a side of eggplant and turkey meatballs and some olives. The quality and freshness was very good. The chart board was good with prosciutto, parm, salami, Brie, nuts and jam. the pickled items in my wife's salad were a bit much. The both meatballs had the arrabiatta sauce which was very good (will try on pasta next). Many varieties to choose from. Service was excellent. We went in at opening and the place filled in quickly behind us. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Fun atmosphere and it's always happy hour at the bar! 5 dollar beers and glasses of wine, can't beat it. Food is really good too. If you want to have a date night come sit at the bar and visit our favorite bartenders Tyler and Katie  for dinner and a drink!"}
{"text":"Gotta be honest, I haven't had pasta this good since I was in Italy. The service was absolutely fantastic and the food was to die for. I live in another state and I guarantee you I'll be coming back to Arizona just to eat here!"}
{"text":"06/08/2018: I hate giving reviews like this and was surprised by how frustrated and disappointed in this restaurant I was. 

My family and I had a party of 6. I attempted to make reservations a couple of days prior to Friday, 06/08, but the phone recording says that they only take reservations of 10 or more. Going out to eat at 6:30 on a Friday night with 6 people and not having a reservation is a recipe for waiting, which we were prepared to do. What I wasn't prepared for was seeing two open large tables that were not being seated along with a couple of four tops that were open. When I asked why they weren't seating people, they said they didn't have enough staff. Phoenix is hot so having to wait outside at an overcrowded bar while tables were open started the frustration. 

Once we were seated, the server did not ask us if we'd been here before and didn't bother to explain the menu. Usually explaining the menu isn't necessary, but this restaurant features unique options to order meatballs and sauce a la carte or choosing a bottom, the sauce and the kind of meatball. This is such a cool idea, but when it's your first time, the server should really walk you through your options. I ordered three a la carte meatballs and the side salad. Again, the server didn't say what type of dressing came on the salad and definitely did not ask me what kind of dressing I wanted. The salad came out and it had balsamic, which I don't like so the salad was sent back. On the turkey meatball, I asked for pesto which didn't taste anything like pesto because they put red sauce in it, again why wouldn't the server bring that up? And overall, I was just disappointed in the service and food.

This is a great location, a great idea and a cool layout. I hope they are able to get it together because this restaurant has some great features, but their service has to get better."}
{"text":"So often we have a nice meal or receive great service, but The Sicilian Butcher has it all.  The Charcuterie Board has great cheeses and creative starters.  I had Tony's meatball and it hit the spot.  Perfectly seasoned and prepared.  While I enjoyed everything served, the cheesecake was the best I've ever had.  

The service was perfect and the staff was having as much fun as we were.  

Worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"My first review was apparently deleted by yelp, which is not okay at all! The Sicilian Butcher is amazballs!! The steak meatballs where perfectly spiced and went so well with Flora's salad! The gnocchi my friend had was so light and fluffy that I wished I had ordered my own! The olive oil cake is my new favorite dessert and the service and atmosphere were on point! Definately my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"It's important to know that the food is good. It is. Better yet the wait staff are superb. Easy family feeling with an awesome selection of meatballs. Build your own dinner. I've met the GM, owner and a future Mgr tonight all with the intent to ensure my satisfaction. Yes. I'm happy and I've got dinner for tomorrow. We'll be back. Thanks Gino, Christie, Tony and all servers who make sure the water is full."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant. Incredible service. The \"boards\" of appetizers and desserts were stunning. We loved the drinks, personalizing our dinner orders. And our waiter Gino made the whole experience amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner and everything was amazing!  We started with the mozzarella board.. so delish!! For dinner We had the tomasos meatballs with spaghetti and the eggplant meatballs with gnocchi and both dishes were great!! So happy to have such a good restaurant in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Went with my wife and 2 daughters for a late lunch...
As we were walking in, we were impressed by the look and feel of the restaurant itself--the atmosphere seemed spot on! 
We received waters and menus quickly and didn't see a server for 10 mins. We ordered drinks (a beer and wine) and food together--received our drinks immediately, but didn't receive our food for 30 mins. 
When asked how our server was doing, because who doesn't ask have an open conversion with their server? She responded by saying, \"it's crazy!\" (The restaurant was half full.) 
Now to the food:
I ordered a Sicilian sausage cheese panini with onions, peppers, and shaved mozzarella on ciabatta  bread. Until now, every place I have been considers a panini a P. R. E. S. S. E. D. sandwich. Not today. The \"panini\" was bigger than my head and required me to unhinge my jaw like a snake to eat it. To boot the sausage was undercooked, and the dish overall was bland. 
My wife had the \"Cured meat and cheese board.\" First of all, the menu states meat and cheese, but the description says, \"cured meats and cheeses\", so which is it?! If you love a charcuterie board as much as my family does this is not your place--especially if you have any cow dairy issues. Goat cheese is your only option: covered in honey or plain. No manchego. No feta. No buffalo mozzarella. And no sheeps milk cheeses. If you want \"cured meats\" your SOL--you only get one option: Prosciutto. The condiments seemed to be the best part. 
My oldest daughter got the Sfincione flatbread which could have used more favor. The ricotta was tasteless. 
My youngest daughter had a kids grilled cheese. Her \"grilled\" cheese looked as if someone decided to shave off the mold growing on the top part of her bun, and did not appear to have been touched by a hot surface. 
The French fries were cold and tasteless, and the server seemed indifferent. As did the manager when we told him we had been waiting 30 min for our food. His response: \"Really?\"
Yes, really. 
Won't be back."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place and we will be back! The minute you walk through the door, the aroma just permeates the space.  The service, the food and atmosphere is amazing!  We will be back to enjoy cocktails at the outdoor bar.  Gino visited every table to inquire about the food and service. Cant believe it took us so long to try it out"}
{"text":"First time there yesterday for lunch.  Ordered the Sausage and Artichoke Flatbread and an Appetizer.
Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food wasn't hot when we got it.  Didn't try the meatballs.  Will do that next time.
Welcome to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place really hit the mark. Gino our server was exceptional, helpful and attentive. There were 3 in our party and we each tried a different variety of meatball and shared. All were excellent. The sauces were also very good, we didn't get pasta bottoms (trying to be lower carb), but the salad was light and tasty. VERY busy place, we got there at 5 PM and there was already a wait, but we were seated quickly."}
{"text":"From start to finish everything was amazing! Fun cocktails, great atmosphere, and wonderful service. We had two of the charcuterie boards, a couple different meatballs, and tried a few of the desserts. Everything we ordered had great flavor and was delicious. Excited to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"3 stars may be a stretch for our first time visit. Every time I drove by, the place was packed and I was anxious to try it. Despite my sister's negative review on her visit with the family. Well, she was right.  First, I wanted to try the chickpea fries(pannelle).  Normally, I never add salt to an item, but these lacked in flavor. So, we ordered what seemed to be the highlight of the restaurant-meatballs.   Pick your meatballs, pasta and sauce.  I ordered the crab and shrimp- very tasty. My husband ordered the steak-very disappointing. But the sad part was the pasta!  Both of ours were over cooked . Mushy might be a better word. That is one thing an Italian restaurant should be amazing at and they were not.  Coming from an Italian family, Calabrese to be exact, I was hoping for a great Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. We may try again, maybe a lunch instead.  Otherwise, the drive to our favorite restaurant near Scottsdale and Shea will do."}
{"text":"Get the board! Seriously you won't regret it. It's the perfect way to introduce yourself to all the amazing food they have here. This is the best meal I've had in a long time. Everything was delicious, high quality, and well thought out. We didn't get the dessert board...but we're already planning on coming back for it! The service was amazing! They treat you like a friend here. I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"We were back to check this place again last night to see if we could turn it into our neighborhood go to spot... and YES...food was great (lots of meatballs/pasta/sauce combinations)...staff super attentive and friendly (shout out to Yolanda)...very comfortable and lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service is terrible.  The old blonde lady who hosts does not know how to tell time.  She told my party we would be seated shortly - shortly is the new 1 hour or more wait time.  Food was not great.  My child's meatballs tasted plain - almost costco like.  I will say the eggplant balls were very tasty.  Will probably not return :("}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere here is amazing! Chris was our waiter and was very informative and helpful with the menu. Highly recommend the eggplant Parmesan and the meatballs are Devine!!! They don't currently serve bloody Mary's but Chris still made sure we got them anyway. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Natalie was terrific server this evening for my special retirement dinner! Our meal was delicious and enjoyable! She is friendly and knowledgeable!! This was our first meal at the Sicilian Butcher and won't be our last!"}
{"text":"Kinds small but good great! Get their early and happy hour is wonderful with wine and people watching. Fun people and lots of smiles!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely phenomenal. My girlfriend and I shared a charcuterie board and Uncle Arthur's Meatballs. I would very highly recommend this spot for lunch. Great new addition to he neighborhood! We will be back."}
{"text":"Had a great happy hour here! The food was really good and they have a great wine pour! The music was playing on the patio and had an all around good time!"}
{"text":"First and foremost...PLEASE get a gluten free meatball on the menu!!!! And person with Celiacs disease, wheat allergy or wheat intolerance will know (and you can write a disclaimer) that the potential for cross contamination is extremely high and to proceed at their own risk. But you should still offer it with the disclaimer. Gluten free breadcrumbs are sooooo simple too make not to mention readily available. 

Decor: Very open and airy. They had the garage/sliding doors open and it was really nice. Despite being extremely crowded it didn't feel claustrophobic bc of the set up of restaurant. Clean. 

Service: Great. Waiter appeared  to be Italian so we followed his recommendations. He was attentive and funny and added to a great experience. 

Drinks: husband got their take on a margarita and it was great. I got the Italiano which is a drink with a bourbon base and some bitters. Super smooth. 

Food: chopped salad was awesome. Dressing delicious and lots of yummy ingredients- olives, meat, cheese, crisp lettuce. Got the NY meatballs in aribiatta sauce over pasta. yum!! Really well done meatball. The pasta however not so much. In an effort to be al denate it was actually under cooked. Getting pasta to the exact level of readiness is an art that hopefully they will perfect. Different pastas require different boiling times an soften temperature so I'm a busy crowded restaurant I imagine they have one set times for all pasta which results in the wrong readiness. They'll need to work on that.  Ended with cheesecake. Would not say it was the best but it was still really good and we finished it for sure. 

We will be back....and hopefully when we go with my daughter with Celiacs who will be able to get their delicious gluten free meatballs. Please please make a gluten free meatball for her and others like her!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Delicious!! Nailed it! I've been wanting to try this place out since it opened and it's always packed, which of course is a great thing, and after today I can understand why! By far one of the best, most fresh, tastiest meatballs I've ever had. This place prides themselves in making outstanding meatballs and surely have raise the bar! With a great happy hour selection and menu selection there is something for everyone! Gino was so kind and welcoming, he personally came up to our table and greeted us, and checked in to see how our meal was. Thank you Gino!! Our waiter was also very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu, which I always appreciate since I'm very indecisive. The pictures do not do it justice, but I highly recommend the $18 board and bottle. A full board loaded up with meatballs with a chilled bucket of white wine or a house red. The spaghetti and meatballs is the perfect bowl of comfort food, the the prosciutto bruschetta is the perfect amount of sweet and savory!"}
{"text":"Being originally from Phila/NJ metro area, it is a beautiful thing to get REAL (fresh) Italian meats and cuisine in Phoenix... I NEEDED this place in my life!! The atmosphere is chill, relaxed and the staff was attentive and extremely friendly #LovedIt"}
{"text":"Slam dunk. Great atmosphere, great drinks, and even better food all at a reasonable price. Wish they took reservations but we didn't have to wait long. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"What a great date night! Scrumptious food from the appetizer to the dessert. Gino was a fun host."}
{"text":"After several trips to the Butcher I feel like we have a good feel for this place. It took 4 trips just to get to the pasta. Most of my reviews are centered Saturday late lunch/day drinking. It's our \"night out.\"
We like this as we can usually sit at the bar. You learn so much more about the place when you are sitting at the bar. Also, it's always Happy Hour at the bar, only the bar.

The cocktails are really good, beer is a little limited, and not a huge fan of the wines (but that's nit picky).

The spaghetti and meatballs were great, and cooked perfect al dente. I am a fan of the bucket of meatballs (Tomaso's and Uncle Arthurs) with the Sunday Sugo. Very tender. Better than Mama's! Although she wasn't Italian, so...

The Bottle and Board is a GREAT deal and perfect for two.

They have a great courtyard for outside seating, and it is covered and misted."}
{"text":"Staff SO FRIENDLY and NICE

There was a long line ahead of us when we turned up and it was about 5:20pm. The place is popular. We were told the wait was going to be 10 minutes, it was literally 10 minutes and we were seated. I was impressed with that

Truth be told I am not really a pasta person. My significant other really wanted to try this and on a whim before a movie we dropped by.  Best whim I have had lately!

We ordered a bruschetta board. You can select four types of  bruschetta from a pretty wide choice. One of my choices was the tomato one which was good , but paled in comparison to the other three on the board.  

Ricotta + prosciutto +honey+hazelnut 
Fig Jan+charred Brie+pistachio crumble
Local dates+ricotta +bacon

All of them were brilliant and I can't wait to eat them again. Eight generous pieces come on the board. 
 
I am not a pasta person as I can think of better ways to eat carbs as in bruschetta 

My significant other ordered the NY meatballs with vodka cream sauce over mafalde noodles    I had one bite of the pasta and pushed my plate forward to share his meal. The pasta and the sauce made me rethink eating pasta again.  I am going back to have my own bowl. It was excellent 

All in all a memorable meal. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"First time patrons of this establishment. Let's start by saying, we are 100% Sicilian and the food was amazing!!! Ambiance a 10, our server, James, made our evening an over the top experience! James knows his menu and suggestions were spot on! Asked to speak to the manager to share how pleased we were and seemed like we were a nuisance to him which was disappointing. Short stature manager with no warmth. Thanks James because you made up for what your manager lacked. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Had happy hour - highly recommend!  The bottle and board for $19 was very good!  Three meatballs, polenta and toasted bread with a nice bottle of wine. We also shared spaghetti and meatballs - another great choice. Service was spot on, too. I will be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"Food and service was great would tell anyone to check this place out for dinner never had Sicilian beer before so I tried something new was the best I've tasted"}
{"text":"Their Flora's Salad and Roasted Beet/Fig salad were delicious!  I wasn't too crazy about the Tony's Dry Aged Meatballs--they were difficult to chew and not super flavorful.  Would definitely come back here to try more items."}
{"text":"This was our second time back. First time we experienced 40 minuets or waiting for a table. This time it was about an 1 hour (Wednesday night). I understand this is a fairly new location, however it would be good idea if this place took reservations instead of buzzer system. The hostess seems overwhelmed with people's frustrations. We saw at least 4 groups leave while we waited. The food is decent, but the wait and the over crowded front entry way is chaos."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with friends. The food was delicious. The service was very good considering it was their opening night. We're happy they're in our neighborhood. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I have been there numerous times since they've opened and the food has always been delicious and the service has been outstanding.  The bruschetta board, Tomasos meatballs, house made pasta and sauce are my go to items.  The cocktails are fabulous as well.  Most recently I sat outside at the bar with my friend and Nicole the bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this concept when I first heard about it but I am absolutely loving it! Focusing on meatballs and Charcuterie boards, you can really taste and feel the quality. And everyone was so lovely and kind. I really loved our hostess Bonny. #1 You can't help but notice she's one stylish lady!! I couldn't stop staring at her shoes let alone her whole outfit. She was super sweet and kept checking on my husband and I. She welcomed everyone like they were family as they came through the door. Our waitress helped us through the menu and gave us her favorites. We ended up with 3 TOMASO'S SICILIAN MEATBALLS, with VODKA CREAM SAUCE, over STUFFED GNOCCHI. This dish was rich but in all the right ways.  The sauce was creamy and complimented the meatballs perfectly, the Gnocchi was perfectly cooked a little chewy in the middle just the way they should be. We also had to get a BRUSCHETTA BOARDS of course. The 4 we chose were dill mascarpone + smoked salmon + crispy capers + lemon, ricotta + prosciutto + honey + hazelnut, local dates + ricotta + bacon, and the wild mushroom + goat cheese + fried leeks + truffle essence. I think I would end up ordering the exact same ones again. So many quality ingredients on one beautiful, delicious board. 

About the visual appeal, everything is open and beautiful. If it weren't so windy and cold out that day, there was no way I would miss sitting on their big gorgeous patio. I will be coming back very soon to do so. Everything felt a little fancy but just casual enough where you wouldn't get side eye for wearing jeans, flip flops and a tank top. Gym clothes... Maybe.

So I am here to ask you... WHY THE HECK HAVE YOU NOT TRIED THE SICILIAN BUTCHER YET?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE!?"}
{"text":"First off I have not eaten at this restaurant. I went there for dinner after seeing the on line menu and reading the many good reviews. I am from N.Y. so I am always seeking out a good Italian Restaurant. After reading the on-line menu I decided to given them a try. When I arrived, there was a 30 minute wait which is not too bad for a busy night. While waiting I had the chance to look at a menu. Much to my surprise the menu was different from the menu on line. I specifically went to this restaurant with the intent on ordering the Sicilian Street Board which included panelle.  I had been looking for a restaurant serving this dish for quite some time and haven't found anyplace in Phoenix that makes it.  I was quite surprised to see that it was removed from the in restaurant menu. ( Note it is still included in the on-line menu). Although the rest of the menu looked good I lost my appetite at what I feel is misrepresentation. If you are going to post an on line menu then you should honor it and if you change the menu you should change it on-line as well. I just checked and you still haven't updated the on line menu. Perhaps your food is really good but your business practices are misleading."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this review with the positives... 
1. The outdoor seating and overall ambiance of the restaurant was very fun.
2. Service was good. 
3. Food came out quickly. 

Now onto the negatives. I'm not sure how this restaurant gets 4 stars. Maybe I just don't know good Italian food or maybe we ordered the wrong thing. 
We ordered the eggplant Parmesan appetizer and sausage meat walls with a red pesto sauce (recommended by our waiter) with gnocchi pasta. The eggplant appetizer was just very  underwhelming and the garlic bread that came out with it was not even warm. Our main dish was again just very underwhelming. It wasn't terrible but my first thought was that I would just rather have Olive Garden. 
I would give this place a second shot just to see if maybe another dish would be more worth the while but I just left feeling very unsatisfied by the food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal. Had the Pistacchio Mortadella Panini, it was amazing. Shared it with my husband not that big but I wanted him to try it and he thought it good too. Bread was soft but had a crunch. He had the flatbread with prosciutto and arugula which has
whipped goat cheese. I don't care for goat cheese but this was actually good. I took a couple of bites. Dessert sounded amazing but we sat outside and it was a little chilly even with the heaters."}
{"text":"This restaurant is way too busy on a Saturday night.  It took 2.5 hours to eat here.  The food is good enough but the kitchen can't keep up.   Skip this one."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had the \"dry aged\" steak balls with spaghetti and arrabiatta sauce. My wife, Sicilian meatballs with vodka cream sauce. Portions were plentiful. Service was spot on. Only complaint is with the loud music. It was difficult to hear our waiter and have dinner conversation. A dj played disco, dance type music that did not seem to fit the ambiance, nor the middle-aged family crowd."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been 4 times since they opened last Friday!!!  The best food, the best staff, and the best atmosphere of any restaurant in our neighborhood!  

The fact that we can ride our bikes there and they cork our wine to go has made this our fav local spot of all time!

The meatballs and palenta are amazing and the meat and cheese board is off the charts.  Sit at the bar and have fun with friends you bring or friends you will make in this fun setting. 

Will be riding over again this weekend and am looking forward to these guys opening at 11:00 next Monday!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, drinks were superb and the staff was great. I will be back. Too bad they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here, we were a little leery having read a lot of reviews and spoke to friends and neighbors about how slow the service was but we had great service. Ashlynn was excellent, she made some good recommendations too!
My only complaint/suggestion is that the food, meatballs and sauces in our case, should be served at a much hotter temperature. The meatballs were warm and cooked through but they and sauces should have been much hotter, had they been, I would have given five stars.
The flavors were very good. We will return."}
{"text":"We had nice time here last night and the food was pretty good, too 

One of things that I would recommend is standing near the plants as you come in. You'll get a good view of the food as it passes by, and some ideas of what you may want to order. 

The wine list had some good selections and I thought the value was great. Most bottles were priced between $28 to $35, with a per glass price of $10.  We ordered a bottle of their Sicilian Pinot, which had no bite and was very tasty (see photo).  A keeper. 

As for our Entrée, both were hits and misses. The Sicilian Butcher offers a three step process for ordering. First you order your sauce, then you select your three Meatballs and finally your pasta. The star here are their meatballs and not the pasta; so don't expect normal sized meal portions.  

My scratch made pasta was probably out 5 mins too early for alla dente, while my wife's was on the other side, somewhat mushy and over cooked. The sauces for both were very good. 

The meatballs were okay. I really liked my pork sausage made meatballs ($18.00), but my wife's sirloin steak meatballs ($16.00) were m'eh and had a slightly metallic taste. 

The Sicilian Butcher's menu is pretty extensive (photo) and since this was only our first visit, so I'm sure our experience will only improve with time. 

As my fellow Yelp'er Cindy pointed out in her review, this place has a lot of potential, once things settle down a bit. 

So Three Stars, \"A-Okay\". Expect a forty-five minute wait time around 6 pm and to pay $35 each."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow...where have you been my entire life, Sicilian Butcher?
This amazing place is nicely decorated (indoor and out), has a super friendly staff and ownership and delicious food.  

We shared a cheese and charcuterie board and the turkey meatballs with vodka cream sauce over risotto.  Huge portions, full of flavor and reasonably priced.  We have been talking about this place ever since our visit and can't wait to come back in for the bottle and a board special. Even though this place is pretty far from where we live, it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We have been excited to try this restaurant since it opened. We can cross it off our list and likely won't be back. We went on a Sunday evening. It was a 30 minute wait and there were over 15 open tables. They were sorely under-staffed and haven't quite \"got it together.\" They were out of pretty much everything; Pinot noir, bruschetta, sausage meatballs...really??! The artisan cheeseboard was decent.  Cheeses weren't great. We waited over 40 minutes for one bowl of pasta...and when it got to our table it was wrong. I will say the best part was Igor, the tireless, hard working server that definitely softened the mishaps with extra glasses of wine and correcting our order. He had a great personality and was very apologetic. I recommend waiting good while while they work out beginners kinks. I wasn't wowed...too bad! Too many other places that do have it together!!"}
{"text":"I would have given five stars but it is very inconvenient that they do not accept takeout orders by phone. So I have to go in and order and wait at the noisy and crowded bar area. The vast majority of restaurants let me call in an order ahead of time and have it ready for pick-up. Otherwise, the food here is very good."}
{"text":"Meatballs. Meatballs meatballs.  Sit at the bar happy hour all day.  Recommend the NY Meatballs with marinara.  If you're feeling feisty get the bucket of balls"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, all day every day happy hour at the bar is genius to draw in customers.  

The 5 foot boards of food are amazing.  Meatballs are some of the best in town."}
{"text":"This is a lovely place, I love bruschetta boards and wine and etc. this was my first time dining here and I have waited to come because it has been \"Packed\" every evening.
I decided to come before dinner rush, I came in and didn't know what to do or where to go because nobody greeted us, after a few minutes we were told to sit wherever we want, so we did.
We sat for about 10 minutes then we were given menus and what a tasty menu! Things got rolling.
We chose meatballs with a bottom and risotto and a bruschetta board with 4 different flavors and two lattes. The food came out quickly.
The food was pretty good not as fantastic as I was hoping, the risotto a little \"gummy\". 
The meatballs were quite tasty and huge.
Once things got \"rolling\" with our food and drinks we had very friendly staff asking \"how are things\" and it was just fine, not great but I am not a complainer either. Unless it taste like dirt lol
I heard this place had an \"all day happy hour\" but I forgot to ask and was not informed. So maybe next time I will ask.
I will return to try some other dishes because the ambience is awesome and I am looking forward to a better experience next time. Especially knowing it is affiliated with Tomaso's and I love me some Tomaso's.
I want to say it might have been a shift change that caused us a \"little\" grief.
Price was pretty good, we were given the wrong check but the right change lol if that makes sense.  
Nice portions, we could have fed 3 adults with the portions and it was about 44$ not bad. But we didn't have wine. We took two whole meatballs and risotto home with us.
Will try again!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant!! Very nice set up, elegant and casual at the same time. A trendy cozy place. The staff was very pleasant and the service was awesome! Igor is our new favorite server. He was so great and fun. He had me 7 year old laughing and blushing. His knowledge of the menu was great and he made some suggestions that were perfect for us. The GM and owner stopped by the table along with it seemed every other server. Such great service. We started with the bruschetta board. I just picked four random choices and was so pleasantly surprised. The bread and all ingredients were fresh and combined perfectly! My fav so far is the ricotta, date and bacon bread. Yum! Then we had two meatball plates. My husband picked the sausage, with cream sauce over the ribbon noodles. Great taste, both he and my daughter decided that meatball and pasta was the best on the table. Handmade pasta cooked perfectly and the cream was smooth and not too rich. The portion sizes are filling and we had leftovers for another day. I ordered the Uncle Arthur's meatballs (lamb and beef with some other goodies) with the arriabbatta (sp?) sauce which was a little zesty red creamy sauce over the spaghetti noodles which were extra thick. It was awesome! I will be getting that same dish again! Again the pasta perfectly cooked and the sauce was just the right amount of spice! The meatballs though are my new favorite!!!! I will be recommending that one to everyone. My daughter has the kids spaghetti with meatballs and it was such a large portion! It was so good I would have ordered that myself! Ha. The wine list was such a relief. A good selection and we ended with a really nice bottle of Pinot rich went with our meals perfectly. Then of course after we were already so full we had to have dessert! We had the zeppole which was fried sweet dough you dip in Nutella. Super yum! I also ordered the espresso caramel biding which was like a custard and was AMAZING!!!! I will also be ordering that again!!! Overall it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back to try everything else. We will be regulars for sure!!! If you go ask for Igor you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday around 3, and it was fairly crowded which is always a good sign. Started with a bruschetta board- the red pepper and goat
cheese was a favorite amongst our table. I tried 4
different meatballs with 4 different sauces and they were all great, but my favorite was the aged steak with the vodka sauce. My picky tween gave the kids menu a 5 star rating. She had flatbread, which came with fries. It was a very generous portion. We will definitely be back to try more because along with the tasty food, service was on point."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED.
We live next door, finally deciding to check it out after living there for couple months and our friends told us to check it out.
Couple things, we arrived at 9:48pm

1. When we first walked in, didn't even get greeted. 
2. Sat down, bartender didn't even greet us.
3. By the time she did, was 8min later. (Guess her wine glasses needed to be shined first before she could)
4. When greeted, I got a \"hi, how can I help you? \"

So you close at 10pm, no problem, but the fact that she knew you guys were about to close, she took 8-9 minutes to say something. Then to just tell us \" how can I help you?\" After I've been sitting there for almost 10minutes...
I didn't say anything during because I was waiting for my husband to walk in from the car and to use the restroom. Still, 8-10 minutes? 
That was just unprofessional."}
{"text":"I have lived in north Phoenix for all my life and am always on the look out for new trendy places to eat.  I had read an article on azcentral a few months back talking about this place and was excited to try it as it's right down the street from my house.  

We arrived and were not disappointed by the beautiful patio and modern inside and bar.  We were sat outside immediately and were greeted promptly by our server. 

The concept is amazingly simple.  You pick your meatballs, sauce, and your base.  There are two price levels of meatballs 16 and 18 dollars.  I opted for the dry aged ribeye meatballs with a truffle mushroom sauce over spaghetti.  My wife was also pleased with the selections because she is allergic to tomatoes and they had multiple white sauce options as well.  

Once we got our food (only reason for deducting a Star was the time it took to get our meal) the food was great.  Pasta was perfectly cooked, meatballs were extremely flavorful and moist and the sauce was so good it will make you want to slap yo mama!

The general manager Gino came by and we had a nice conversation with him.  He was extremely personable and you can tell he truly cares for the product he's putting out.  I look forward to bringing my parents here for my wife's birthday dinner. 

Highly recommend this little neighborhood gem for great happy hour, dinner and just a good hang out spot in general.

**update**

After going back multiple times after my first review, this 4 stars gets bumped to 5.  Service has been great each and every time since our first visit.  They have music playing on the patio on the weekends and the staff could not be more friendly."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food, the service both 5 stars!! Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it.

A great nod to Tomaso's and a great menu from top to bottom."}
{"text":"Gotta start this review with our server, Samantha. She freaking ROCKS! She is exactly the type of person EVERY restaurant wants working for them. Super friendly, extremely helpful and always had us smiling. When hubs and I go back, I hope to request her because she's that good. Props girl, PROPS! Oh and the owner, give her a bonus! She deserves one.

O.k., now on to the restaurant.....AMAZE BALLS! Lord we should have visited this place sooner. The atmosphere is AWESOME, a little loud but whatever, you're there for the food. Husband and I ordered the bruschetta board and it was awesome! Such amazing flavors combined on a perfectly toasted piece of bread. The wild mushroom bruschetta is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!

We ordered the sausage meatballs with the stuffed gnocchi with ricotta and spinach, enough to share, especially if you order an appetizer, which we did, the eggplant parm, it's SPECTACULAR. 

We left SO happy and full....we plan on going back this Sunday."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times in last 2 months. Amazeballs! Great food and nice atmosphere. Check it out for sure!"}
{"text":"The best meatballs in town! Quality of the meatballs and pasta and sauce are incredible. I called the number of the restaurant to order over the phone. I heard a voicemail for the restaurant and could swear it was Joe Pesci. It was so funny and well done. I ended up going to the restaurant anyway. I'm glad I did. The wait staff was friendly. Great atmosphere and decoration. Great place to go anytime. Check out the Sicilian Butcher."}
{"text":"Atmosphere amazing and perfect use of space. Food? Very disappointed, the pasta did not taste fresh/handmaiden and meatballs, bland and sad. Maybe it was a off night, with a tenant improvement that beautiful it should reflect the food. Hope they up pastas and meatball recipes. Needs work"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh how did I just find this place!? AMAZING in every way! Ambiance & decor, music (patio DJ, misters), the drinks (sangria rose, wine and beer selection), arancini, meat & cheese board, the meat balls (Uncle Arthur's NY!!), stuffed gnocchi, vodka cream, mafalde noodles, truffle mushroom...all to die for! They do have vegetarian options too! The service is top notch and Gino gets it!! He is all over the place and doing every job while making sure his guests are happy! I can't tell you how great this place is, you MUST find out for yourself! You will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal lunch. Pasta was ridiculously good. Carbonara sauce was on point. Both the Sicilian and sausage meatballs were juicy, tender, and full of flavor. We will be back. Oh yes, we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Cherie, our server, did a great job! Great service!  This was our third time going to The Sicilian Butcher and a great experience every time!  We started with the grilled octopus, tender and delicious.  Presentation was gorgeous!  My husband had the Sicilian meatballs and the arrabbiata sauce. The sauce was spicy and delicious, some of the best we've had. I had the sausage meatballs with their carbonara sauce. The meatballs were delicious with a fennel forward flavor that I love!  The carbonara sauce was creamy and delicious and had baby peas, bonus!  All their pastas are house made. You cant go wrong with any choice!  The drinks are creative too! We had a little wait so I went to the bar to get a couple of adult beverages. WOW!  My husband ordered The Italiano, their riff on a manhattan, I think.  Well imagine my surprise when the mixologist pulled out, I think, a cedar board and a blowtorch!  He fired off the torch and scorched the board, then put the glass on top to catch the flavor of the smoke, my husband loved it!  Great presentation!  Thank you for a lovely evening out!  We have recommended this place to friends and they loved it too!"}
{"text":"The Sicilian Butcher is a fun and quirky take on fully customizable Italian.

Located in North Phoenix, the Sicilian Butcher is the place to be on a Saturday night. The entire restaurant has a welcoming and lively vibe. There was a DJ playing some beats while we waited for our table. The wait was a bit but we didn't mind.

We finally got seated and the decor is eccentric, ranging from butcher knives used as decorative curtains to a giant picture of a man smoking a cigarette while making meatballs. 

The service was alright. It was busy but a server came over to our table and asked if anyone had helped us, when we said no, she said she would be our server. She gave us a rundown of the menu and how you choose what meatballs you want, the sauce and what pasta to adorn the bottom. I ordered their margarita, a bruschetta board and the crab and shrimp meatballs over risotto with their cream sauce. My husband ordered the steak meatballs with the meat sauce and the polenta. 

My margarita arrived covered in salt all over the glass. It was wasn't terrible but my hands were super salty because of it. The Bruschetta board was amazing! I loved everything except the Salmon one, it was cooked which made the taste different. My meatballs were amazing and I am so glad I went with that combo. My husbands meal was okay but we weren't huge fans of it. Overall we enjoyed our experience and hope next time the service will be more organized.

This is the place to go to for their Bruschetta and Charcuterie boards, next time I'm bringing more friends so we can try the 5 foot Charcuterie board."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Very comfortable surroundings. Great meatballs & pasta. Large portions.  Very welcoming hosts & servers.  Fun place with really good food. Will definitely go back there soon.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I am so happy this places opened. The neighborhood has been dying for a fun spot and here it is! The bar is always bumping and the food is phenomenal. So many great options yet simple menu. I love charcuterie and all the Italian flavors on the menu. Any 1 star review of this place is a single bad experience because I've been a dozen times now and feel the 5 stars is really worth it! This place gets busy so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food is fantastic and service even better!  Had two apps and some meatballs, craft cocktails and well drinks! So glad to have this in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal with friends.  We went on a Sunday evening around 6.  The place was nearly full for the entire 2-3 hours we were there.  We started with the craft cocktails.  The Pepe Pepe was fabulous.  The 5 foot app board does not dissapoint and could have been a meal of itself.  Great meatballs, meats, cheese, and olives.  The NY meatballs with the spicy marinara sauce over gnocchi was full of flavor. The house made pasta was great.  Our favorite dessert was the caramel pana cotta.  Great attentive staff and managers.  My only regret was it was too cold to eat outside.  I'll just have to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday. The food is great and well worth the price. All the pasta is HAND MADE daily which you can taste with every bite. The wait time was quoted 15-20 minutes. For us it only took 8 minutes to be seated. Our server was wonderful and very attentive. You can't get any closer to Sicily by eating here!"}
{"text":"Sooo happy this place is finally open! It was a little tough trying to decide what I wanted to eat because I could literally eat everything on the menu! We have definitely found a great new place to eat. The staff was extremely friendly. The food was exceptional and the decor was perfect! The only negative thing is that I don't live close to the Sicilian Butcher! Thank you for a great experience and amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Great food.. Amazing Meatballs... we tried almost every one on the menu.  Great wait staff and super fast service, has great Patio and fire place, makes for very relaxing experience."}
{"text":"A group of us, six to be exact, all dined here this past Saturday. It was the first time for most of us and I can hardly wait to return.

Everyone we encountered was delightful from the hosting staff to the young man refilling our water cups. 

Gino was our waiter and provided excellent service. He was attentive without rushing us and we never once had to wonder where he had gotten off to if we needed to order something else. We ate a lot of food!

I highly recommend The board that they offer. It's 5ft long and offers a sampling of their appetizers. We were given a selection of meats and cheeses, roasted nuts, the Arancini, and the polenta fries amongst others. The specialty cocktails were truly unique. We all enjoyed what we tried. 

The dessert board! The homemade caramel sauce on the Pana cotta was sublime! And the olive oil tiramisu was my favorite. (Get the espresso with some sambucca if you are feeling exceptionally indulgent like I was)

Gino's service though was the highlight. His suggestions were spot on and his friendly casual manner left us knowing we were in good hands. We will gladly return and will ask for Gino."}
{"text":"You have to try this place. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is fun and inviting. Gino delivers the best customer service and  remembers me each time I'm in. Met Dominic tonite who will be managing a sister restaurant in Chandler. He's fantastic too!!  Feels like family every time!"}
{"text":"For the 4th day open...ran like a charm. I also thought the decor was cool.  I really enjoyed the mozzarella en carozza and would have loved a little more of the delicious caper sauce (maybe in a ramekin instead of on plate). The dry aged meatballs were perfect and I am very fussy with meatballs. Chitarra was good but oversauced. The deconstructed cannoli for dessert was really one of the top 5 restaurant desserts I've ever eaten. My husband and I split it and we were fighting for morsels . Would definitely return to try other items on menu."}
{"text":"Finally an Italian joint in the neighborhood besides freakin pizza. Went in on a Friday night and place was busy, waited around 20 minutes. Good concept with the build you own bowl, though the bruschetta and charcuterie looked amazing as well . The freshness of the pasta is outstanding and the different sauces were excellent. I ordered the lamb meatballs with gnocchi paired with the mushroom truffle sauce. The gnocchi were heavenly and the sauce had a nice flavor without overpowering the meatballs. Portion size was great and the price was spot on. The wife ordered the ribbon pasta paired with vodka sauce and crab cake and shrimp meatballs,  which again was excellent as well, and a unique twist on the typical Italian style meatball. Overall service was good though you can tell most of then servers were newbies. Highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic food from southern Italy. Girls day out so we shared a bruscetta board, every slice was different and flavorful with real, fresh ingredients. Dessert was Deconstructed Cannolli - deliciousness in every bite. Will be bringing my husband back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our one year wedding anniversary since my family said it was outstanding. And they were right! Delicious and authentic. My family is from Italy and obviously we typically make our own Italian food so when we say an Italian restaurant is good, it means it's good! Immediately when I walked in, I felt at home. It's definitely a modern day traditional restaurant. We were greeted by possibly the manager or owner which was very nice. And our waiter was wonderful. He was from Italy with an Italian accent. He reminded me of my Nonno who recently passed away so it was a breath of fresh air. The pasta is made fresh and the dry aged meatballs melted in your mouth. Amazing craft cocktails. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"So glad to have this place in my neighborhood!!  The meatballs are good and you can have them basically any way you could imagine. Had meatballs with marinara and polenta. Yum!  The charcuterie platters and bruschetta are amazing. They have great specials at the bar all day every day. Fun hip vibe. Casual neighborhood vibe with a fun grassy area where you can dine outside or play corn hole. Love it."}
{"text":"Finally a business that I feel will last! This specific location has failed a couple of times and I'm so happy to see it's been completely revamped and bought out by new owners. The meatballs are so good! The atmosphere and service was great. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! We tried the Uncle Arthur style meatballs along with some bruschetta. The pear and brie bruschetta with fig jam was the big hit. Wish number 1 is that we wish we had ordered more of it. Wish number 2 is that we wish we had taken more people with us. Then we could have sampled more food. The portions are generous, so take friends."}
{"text":"Pasta was great, meatballs were excellent. Only complaint is that it is the only Italian restaurant that has EVER charged me for bread. I know that it is only a couple of bucks but come on!!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here tonight and had such an excellent experience.  Our server, Christie,was attentive, kind, and informative.  The pasta and the Sicilian meatballs with vodka sauce were so lovely! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding meatballs!  Fresh ingredients and amazing flavors.  Tons of options.  Kids menu was also very good.

Overall, great value.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.  The food here is AMAZING!!!  Do not the location (In a strip mall 2 doors down from a Dunkin' Donuts) fool you.  This place offers AMAZING food in a casual environment with friendly service.  The noodles are freshly made on site; the meatball varieties are plentiful (and all tasty); and the portions are HUGE.

DO NOT MISS this amazing restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Good bread good food good service. Keep up the quality. Staff is friendly and polite service is quick. Highly recommend.."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a colleague and decided to try it out. Place had a wonderful ambience and their meatballs were yummy!! The owner was really friendly and welcoming. Also looked like a good place for just chilling with some wine and appetizers. Can't wait to come for the happy hour"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Been there 3 times in one month! The ambience is fun, the food is delicious and the service is awesome!!! We've tried several things and everything has been great. The cheesecake is the best!!! I'm not even a cheesecake person but loved it. Guaranteed to have a great meal and you'll leave pleasantly plump and happy!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try Sicilian butcher tonight, we were excited about it. We got there around 545, and at 605 our waiter finally came around to take our orders. The service was terribly slow and it didn't make sense why he had our table as his other 5 tables were inside and we were sitting his only table outside. We ordered the Sicilian meatballs with marinara sauce and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was good and the sauce was ok. The other pasta we had was the wide noodle with the vodka sauce and steak meatball, the vodka sauce had no flavor just tasted like cream. The meatballs in both case were fine, but nothing great about them. We ordered the deconstructed cannoli which was the highlight of the meal. The whole meal took around 90 minutes on a Thursday with 2 toddlers, terrible and slow."}
{"text":"Good food.... great concept.  Work on service a little but overall good.  Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing as was the ambience.  What most made our night was the corporate manager, Gino.  

As we were waiting for a table to open up, he came by introduced himself and offered us an espresso on the house. He also checked in on us later in the evening; granted the restaurant was very busy.  

It completely changed the overall mood for the evening. We loved it and our server was awesome too.  Will definitely definitely be coming back.  Thanks, Gino!!  Owners, give this man a raise!"}
{"text":"Been waiting to come here for a while as it is always full.  Come early! Had the meatballs and spaghetti and it was wonderful.  We had the cheesecake for dessert."}
{"text":"We had a delicious supper here. Whoever did the AZ Republic review missed the mark. 

The vibe is good and the service was friendly and professional. 

We each chose a different meatball selection, a different pasta and difference sauces. Each choice was excellent. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was Phenomenal!! We ordered the meatball and polenta board plus the steak meatballs with arrabiata sauces. Everything has great flavor and the portions were much larger than expected. The only negative thing was that happy hour was at the bar only, and this was NOT stated on their online menu. Had this been specified more clearly then we would have ordered drinks and an appetizer. Overall - great experience and the outdoor patio was romantic and relaxing."}
{"text":"This is very painful downgrade. My first experience was overall excellent. I really liked this restaurant and the concept....I can only hope I hit them on an off day.

This time we sat on the patio and I had a different server. To cut things short.....I was served cold food and service was a problem this time.

A food runner or food jockey (someone other than our server) drops off our meals and doesn't offer us cheese. We wait and wait and wait and finally my husband walks to the other side of the patio to get the cheese guy to come to our table so we can get some cheese.

I go to taste one of the Eggplant Parmesan Balls. It was very mushy and COLD was made with tough eggplant skin. I don't get the parm here. Maybe if they were stuffed with a piece of cheese I would think eggplant parm more....and the texture needs something.....another binder. Or maybe if the ball was served at the correct temperature Maybe it would be better and the right texture.........On top of that were a few more issues. The Ball was almost cold and had a refrigerator cold center. The other thing was the sauce. Last time I had the Arrabiatta Sauce. Last time it was DELICIOUS and Spicy....The sauce was good but wasn't spicy.....I don't know if I was served Arrabiatta or something like a marinara. As my bottom of the plate I picked the stuffed Gnocchi.....They came to me soaked in lots of oil.....I like a little oil and when I make Gnocchi I coat them in oil too because good oil adds a nice taste and the gnocchi don't stick together...but this was too much oil. I also like them on the soft side so they are lighter and melt in your mouth but these were on the mushy side. Maybe they were just overcooked?

Our server never checked on us.

After we were done we pushed our plates to the side a woman ask me if I want my leftovers wrapped up (TWO EGGPLANT BALLS...I only ate one because I had to eat something...I was really hungry). She said she was a friend of the owner and was there to help. We told her why we didn't want the leftovers. We told her that nobody offered us cheese. Our server never checked on us. The Eggplant Balls were served with a cold center. We also told here the Arrabiatta Sauce that we enjoyed last time wasn't spicy tonight. She said she's tell someone who could do something about what we told her...We waited a little while and our server comes out and offers us dessert. We declined and paid the bill and left.

I don't want anything for free I just wanted the owner to know so he can fix things and make everything delicious again because I doubt anyone said anything to him."}
{"text":"Soooooo, I'm in town from LA for work. I check Yelp for 4-5 star restaurants in Phoenix, AZ. This place popped up on my search feed.  I don't even even Yelp and this restaurant was so impressive to me that I had to join Yelp for it. 

The Lobster and Crab balls with (I think, sorry I forget) white cream sauce is amazing. It is rich but absolutely sinfully delicious 

The Octopus appetizer is ridiculously soooo good, that I'm telling the chef if she/he removes it from the menu it will be a mistake they regret. Nice smoky sear on the outside and juicy on the inside. It's hard to do this dish without making it gamey/too hard and chewy.  The sautéed fennel adds a rich but herbed flavored kick to the dish. Olives. Man olives! They just rock my palette. Again, full of flavor but not salty

The Ariancini balls were on point! Like fried risotto balls but the seasoning was not too salty and really warm and creamy. This is hard to do with fried food. I order this last night and came back for these balls (lol) today. 

Dessert. I ordered the Affogato. I was expecting just vanilla gelato and espresso but this place threw cotton candy as a garnish! I'm like ahh, What?!? This was soooo delicious and honestly f$&@ing awesome. 

So let's talk about service. 

5 stars to my server Alicia. She was polite and not obnoxious. She did several walk bys to see if I needed anything but never was annoying like some servers are when they over ask, \"How is everything?\"in a robotic voice. Or talks too much. Gave me eye contact several times and knew when to leave me alone. I like that she was very zen. 

Bus boys/back servers/runners were attentive, polite, and on top of dishes and refills. Absurdly adorable staff

5 stars to the manager Gino for doing a table check every 30 mins. Sometimes the manager does it too much or not enough at all.  It was nice to have a happy medium. He had a nice smile and a comfortable vibe. He really made me feel like this was place was his home. 

5 stars on the decor. Love American Fusion restaurants. This is modern Italian American Fusion. Classic Italian music in the background and leather seating with rich woods but with modern structure and stream lined. The bar is attractive and a welcome social scene for the young crowd. Really like the people watching here   

All in all, you should try this place. Restaurants like this will put Phoenix on the map for the culinary world"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food. I am a gluten free vegetarian and they were able to accommodate my request for a meal not on the menu. My husband had meatballs and polenta which he enjoyed as something different."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambience. Alec the young waiter could give lessons in superior service. Never had to wait for drink refills, plate clearing, timing for food, highly personable and attentive. We had bucket of meatballs, prosciutto bruchetta, chopped salad, eggplant in vason jars,  tiramisu and cappuccino. Can't wait to go back. Happy hour all day every day was superb."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  Service was phenomenal, and the atmosphere is wonderful.  Had the bruschetta, and pasta with sausage meatballs.  Everything tasted great!

Go and visit this place- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was a busy Saturday night I was seated outside as my preference. It was a slow start to be noticed after about 13 minutes but once this was rectified,  I give glowing remarks on the service from our server (she used all our names and the interaction was very conversational).  The food was delicious.  I had the steak meatballs over spaghetti pasta and it was prepared perfectly!  The seasoning in the meatballs was balanced and flavorful.  The craft cocktails were generous and tasted great.  The Italiano is the one to get!   Luigi came by and ensured our remaining time was great and presented us with a fine selection of desserts that again were generous portions and yummy for the tummy.   I highly recommend this new eatery in the neighborhood and we will be back plenty of times introducing new friends to this Italian gem."}
{"text":"You get 1 star for lousy attitude, the old lady host!!! Smile a little and cater to your customer! It's good for business!! Capisce?? Food? Ok"}
{"text":"Seemed a bit uptown urban for us but we were won over soon after we were sat and biting into our meals.
The menu is not like anything offered at most of the restaurants in the area, so it was quite fun to look over the menu and try something different from the ordinary Italian fare offered at most of the local restaurants.
The service was caring, personable and quick to repair any mishap that occurred in our order.
I do believe we will be back and will spread the word."}
{"text":"Hipster paradise! Snaps. We took a $20 Uber ride to get over here from the convention center! Based on Yelp reviews of course! It was an awesome experience and I definitely recommend coming here. It's in a strip mall, but once you're inside, you are transported back to 1950's Brooklyn. LOVED the ambiance and the decor. Black and white check tablecloths, cool retro chairs, brick walls.... YES. Plenty of parking, and a giant front patio strung with party lights. 

My friend and I ordered drinks, the bruschetta app, meatballs, and desserts. Everything was great. The service was friendly and fast. Not intrusive - perfect. SO MUCH FOOD. You will have leftovers. There are several (8? 10?) types of meatballs and you choose which meatballs you want, then what sauce you want, then what type of pasta shape you want. I love that. Reasonably priced at $16-$18. I had the affogato dessert which is served with cotton candy on top. LOVED it. 

We came late on a Monday and it was PACKED. I can't even imagine how busy it is on the weekends. Call ahead or come early. FABULOUS."}
{"text":"Great new hotspot!  Delicious homemade meatballs (quite a selection to choose from) and delicious homemade pasta to go with (or other base that you so choose).  Wait staff was prompt and friendly.  It's so nice to have a delicious cozy neighborhood place.  The only thing that was a bummer is that the happy hour 18.00 board and bottle of wine only applies if you physically sit in the bar area."}
{"text":"First time here and I was very impressed! Homemade meatballs, excellent happy hour at bar and high tops - all day, everyday, and great service!"}
{"text":"The gourmet meatballs could be served hotter, otherwise the sauces and salads are great."}
{"text":"Great food and service really enjoyed the atmosphere crowd was huge so make your reservation early but a fun place to go."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Sicilian Butcher, I was meeting friends from my old work place for Happy Hour! The patio seating area is very nice, and the interior is elegant & trendy. We did the wine & platter special that is wonderful! Get price for Fabulous wine choices and a platter with generous meatballs placed on polenta with bread!! Our server was a Darling lady that had recently moved here- I'm sad to say I can't recall her name. She made our time more fun with her attention to our table! We also had a goodie she recommended that I can't remember what its called but it was delicious as well! The only recommendation is different placement of the meat, underneath the first few slices it was like a blob of meat. I'm glad we came early because when we left the place was packed!! I will definitely return with my friends! Thank you Sicilian Butcher for the Enjoyable Evening!"}
{"text":"Went there as a party of 3- service was extremely slow- Ordered the shrimp/clam balls, steak balls, and sausage- shrimp clam balls were over processed paste, steak balls so dry sauce didn't help and the sausage was  just OK.  Too many other places with better food and service"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Meatballs are delicious and mixed drinks are great! :) 
The restaurant is always full. There is indoor and outdoor seating. Really nice cozy atmosphere! Recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! I would recommend it to anyone who loves pasta and meatballs. The desert is amaze as well"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio was so wonderful!  Service was on point, thanks to an attentive manager.

Good and drinks were great!"}
{"text":"You have to like meatballs and pasta to fully enjoy this restaurant. Pastas are house made, wide variety of sauces, and even no meat meatballs available. I give it three stars, not because of the food quality, but because of the limited menu and prices. $60.00 for lunch with an appetizer and soda. A bit much. 3 meatballs with pasta. Just breadsticks on the table. Didn't have dessert. To me it is like a trend that will end. I would prefer a full ITALIAN restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Another wonderful dinner at the Sicilian Butcher.  Gino was an awesome server.  We had bucket of balls, sausage,  bruschetta, eggplant pharm, cocktails, and not a complaint from anyone.  There were 8 of us celebrating a birthday.
Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere! My husband and I sat at the bar and were served by 2 amazing bartenders. The 18 year old boy behind the bar was very helpful and charming. We ordered the bottle and board for $19, 4 delicious meatballs and a bottle of Pinot Noir. We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting patiently for this restaurant to open for business since Modern Grove closed its doors.
Being one that loves pasta and charcuterie and cheese plates I knew I would have to drag my husband to try this place. 
My first experience was lunch with my best friend, dining al fresco in the beautiful AZ winter. Perfect 75 degrees outside with the sun shining couldn't have been more perfect. I love that you can eat outside when it is nice out. I'm glad they kept that feature from Modern Grove.
Tried the risotto with eggplant meatballs in the spicy tomato sauce. It was absolutely amazing. The risotto was perfectly cooked and seasoned and went so well with the meatballs and the sauce. I had some left over that I had taken home and reheated the next day for lunch. It was still heavenly after a quick nuke in the microwave. I cannot say enough about the combination.
The second time visiting was not long after Christmas and I met my parents for a make up Christmas gift exchange. Again, we were able to sit outside (this time in the evening-still perfect weather) and they were extremely busy. Tried a different pasta and sauce this time with the house made pork sausage. It was flavorful, but not as much as the meatballs. My husband had the aged beef meatball and I wanted to eat all of his. Even my daughter ate all of her pasta in white sauce which was impressive.
My father had the meatball sandwich which was odd as it was just two pieces of crusty bread below and on top of 3 large meatballs. Strange way of presenting them but he did enjoy his meal.

All in all, the restaurant is a bit pricey so we won't be able to make it a habit, but I will be coming back as often as possible to hopefully try all the meatball and sauce and pasta combinations. Everything that I have tried so far was delicious and I hope the place can stick around for years and years to come. The location is perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It replaced a restaurant that looked so cute but I had heard was terrible and clearly that was true. Has great seating options insides and out (we opted for outside). The food is super yummy and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The first time I was there with 8 girlfriends, so I got to
see and taste the variety offered.  The food was so delicious,
I couldn't wait to bring my daughter back for lunch.  I was not
disappointed.  The meatballs are delicious, and since I don't
always eat carbs, I was delighted to see that I could have a
ceasar salad with my meatballs.  I would highly recommend,
and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The build your meatball pasta is awesome. The food was wonderful, and the staff is attentive to your needs. Place was packed when we arrived but were seated within 15 minutes. I will make this a regular stop for us. All around a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Everything was fantastic! Best meatballs and gnocchi I have had in a long time. Really cool atmosphere and Gino our waiter was top notch!"}
{"text":"I surprised my wife with a date night and when we arrived her eyes lit up. This place is amazing better than amazing it's phenomenal. Blake our waiter explained the menu since it was our 1st time. We had one of the boards to start and let me tell you it was deeeelish. Everything is made fresh in house and alot is imported from Sicily. Gino who I believe was the owner came up to us like we were his family. He made sure we were alright and that we enjoyed our food. I had the wild mushroom mafalfe with the Tomaso's meatballs it was great! Love the mushroom flavor!! I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! Happy hour served up all day and the vibe is super chill! Hanging meats in a display and an open kitchen with a variety on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  We had the polenta meatball board.  It has 4 meatballs with bread and polenta.  Enough for a meal for 2 poeple.  The sauage meatballs were delicious and the polenta was creamy.  We would order again but i think I would like to try the pasta.  The parking is crazy so get there early.  They also had a DJ playing music which nice."}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to try this place for quite a while and we were finally in the right area at the right time.  We were seated right away and it looked like we chose the right time to get there (about 5PM) because by the time we left the place was packed full of people.  We tried an appetizer (cazzilli) that I wasn't overly fond of.  The texture was too mushy for me.  The sauce that came with them was excellent though.  For dinner we tried the Uncle Arthur's NY meatballs with mafalde pasta and the Sunday Sugo sauce.  That pasta dish and the meatballs were exceptionally good.  I had some left over for the next day and even reheated in the microwave it was delicious.  My husband got a deconstructed cannoli for dessert and never told me how it was.  The other thing I will say is our server was excellent.  She was extremely friendly and personable and provided excellent service throughout the meal.  This would not be a place we would go to often as dinner for two of us with a tip was over $70 but for a special occasion it was a really good place to try."}
{"text":"We did our girls valentines dinner here last Friday. The atmosphere was nice, hip & busy. Chewy was our waiter, he was great. There were 12 of us. He was very attentive & prompt with service. I had the bruschetta & shrimp & crab craft meatballs with vodka sauce. The 4 bruschettas I had were, the date one, the whipped goat cheese one, the salmon one & the smoked blue cheese one. They were all yummy. The meatballs were slightly fishy & the sauce was not a good pairing. I tried the beef craft meet balls, with the vodka sauce & they were delish. For dessert we did the dessert board which was $8 a person & you try all their desserts. Loved the custard & NY cheesecake but not a fan of the tiramisu or cream puff. Their signature cocktails were priced fair & their bottle of Pino Noir was $28. I will return to try more."}
{"text":"bellissimo! Absolutely amazing food & service! The Sicilian Meatballs were the best I have ever had, the risotto was cooked perfectly! Also, had the arugula flatbread, with goat cheese & the yummiest fig jam. Highly recommend this place for a simple lunch or romantic date night- Amazing ambience, great service & incredible staff!"}
{"text":"Great response to the issue I had with the Happy Hour - can't wait to try again! Every person who's been there raves about it."}
{"text":"Yummy eggplant sandwich but only needed 1/2. Size of 7\" circle plate and not to easy to save for leftovers. I don't eat huge servings, so if a 1/2 portion was available I'd be back or when someone will split a veggie sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food and fun atmosphere! Went for happy hour and sat outside at family style table. Met some nice people. Service was good and even had the owner come over and ask how we were doing."}
{"text":"I can not say enough great things about this new restaurant. We tried multiple appetizers and entree's and everything was delicious!  Our server was excellent and very knowledgable about the food and wine. You have to try the meatballs!  They are to die for. It has a really cool feel and decor but make no mistake the food is the show stopper!  (And some really amazing deserts). I 100% recommend this for your next meal out with the family or date night. You can not go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Too bad the poor service and long wait ruin good food.  I waited over 2 hours to eat.  People who came after me were seated before me.  The manager said he would take care of me and did none of the things he promised."}
{"text":"From my personal experience you can tell a good restaurant by ordering take out. If the restaurant puts the same amount of effort in their take out as they do their in house service you know u found a gem.  I ordered to go and the food was awesome. I loved the arnicini and their sausage was so yummy. The container was good quality, I had no worries about anything spilling. I am deafenitly going back and trying their in house service, I am confident that it will be just as good."}
{"text":"First time for me.  Just their second night and I must say I am impressed.  I am a bit of an Italian food snob and I plan on being a regular.  The execution of the menu and service was spot on.  Very nice vibe and GREAT addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Being from New York I'm picky about Italian food.  This is the real deal. Best meatballs I've ever had! There was a 40 minute wait and no reservations but the food is well worth it.  Gino from Hash remembered me which was an extra touch! Will be bringing my family back soon!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up down the street from me and Im a little disappointed in the service. The food is good but the service is terrible. I know they are new so I am hoping this will change but they need to figure it out. I have been twice and have had to wait over an hour for our food."}
{"text":"Loved the Sicilian Butcher! Food and service was outstanding. Emad was Attentive kind and just awesome. Had the caprese board to start, the burrata was to die for.  Got the lamb and beef meatballs, they were enormous but so delicious. Vodka sauce with pasta was yummy too. Had to run to a movie otherwise would have gotten dessert  as well. Will be back soon to try them all."}
{"text":"I must say I am impressed! I came to the Sicilian Butcher with my friend who is vegan We live just 5 minutes away and we will definitely be back soon! 

I love the patio seating, it's open, green and beautiful. The service was amazing by Marlee and Cody at the bar. Marlee was very attentive and you can tell she enjoys working with people by the way she interacts with customers. 

I had the Flora Salad and it was really good, very fresh veggies and tasty dressing. My friend and I split a couple of the bruschettas and they were amazing. Excited for the new neighborhood happy hour spot !"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Great food and live music. Indoor and outdoor seating available. We started with the Mozzarella Board and it was amazing. You can't go wrong with burrata. We also got the bruschetta board. It was huge and very yummy. We split the UNCLE ARTHUR'S N.Y. MEATBALLS with arrabiatta sauce with spaghetti. The food was so good. Pasta was super fresh as it is made in house. We ended the night with the 
AFFOGATO and it was delish as well. Great evening and I will definitely come here again next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, waiter friendly, great atmosphere. A must try.restrooms clean. Excellent deserts"}
{"text":"Just ok  food . drinks were good .turkey meatballs tasted like thanksgiving dinner .  Gotta do better with moister meatballs   . Staff nice  the burrata was good"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day and I was still full at dinner time.

Ordered meatball pasta. Meatball of my choice was shrimp one. It was good but after the first one, I wished I ordered regular meat one. Portion size is huge, they serve three huge meatballs. Really big one. Sauce and pasta was good but I think my choice was wrong. I think it goes well with more traditional choice. 

I ordered oil tiramisu. I should have known from the meatball size. This cake was huge to share with 2 or 3 people. Oh I ate alone and I realized it was mistake the entire afternoon from over eating. I prefer traditional tiramisu with mascarpone. Their tiramisu didn't have that texture. It was good as I ate all by myself but it wasn't what I hoped from traditional tiramisu.

Service was excellent. Owner (I think she was) came by a few times, server was friendly and attentive. I liked when I saw the bar area wall opened up. 

Next time, I am going to try more traditional combination."}
{"text":"Went there for a meetup event.   We all sat on the patio since the weather was still comfortable.   A DJ was spinning some grand tunes.   I ordered the HH rigatone chicken, which includes pasta.   A couple of my friends ordered the meatballs.  (all pictured).   

The rigatone wasn't bad.   Tastier with a bit of the chili flakes.   The meatballs, I must admit, I didn't particularly care for.  

I enjoyed the music the DJ was spinning.   For him I'd give five stars.  

Would I go back?   Probably not.   Nothing about the food particularly stood out."}
{"text":"Excellent (traditional) meatballs and pasta. Tomato Sauce was perfect too. The rice balls appetizer is a must and is really great. Friends ordered panna cotta and it was also great. I'd say the best Italian in town at the moment."}
{"text":"I gotta admit I was a bit skeptical about this place, possibly it was due to the lack of good pictures in people's reviews (if you wanna see good pics, go to their site under \"The Food\" in their menu section.

Why go there:  To our surprise, the crowd of patrons were very diverse, from families with kids, multiple groups of seniors, a flock of young professionals sharing giant charcuterie boards to couples on date nights, this place drew in all kinds of dynamics.  The concept is surely interesting, meatballs and charcuterie?  It actually works when accompanied by great bread and pasta made in-house!  They don't keep a large menu and every item is carefully designed.  The portions were surprisingly generous and there is surely something for everyone here, hence the diverse clientele. The atmosphere is great, a bit loud if you're sitting inside or out, but it's all good, you'll be doing more eating than talking to get to your next dish if like us, you grazed, a lot.

Don't miss:
The house-made pastas were delicious and at a great price point (that alone in a the Valley should draw you there), the Happy Hour at the bar is second to none around that part of town (only available at the bar, ALL DAY, EVERYDAY) it includes a bucket of the signature meatballs ($10), serving up a generous 5-count bucket of possibly 2 oz balls at least, with their tasty bread and sauce!  The Mozzarella board was great, hefty, though unlike the menu says, we didn't get the polenta fries that came with it.  We did order the polenta fries separately ironically though, they were wonderful.  Comes with two sauces, a marinara and a lemony aioli.  

Overall:
It's a busy place, it's louder that most places, but it's the ideal place for groups to gather, the wait is worth it as there is so much that is shareable.  Plan well if you're bringing a crew and try multiple things, like a truly good Italian spot, if you leave without undoing a notch from your belt, you did it wrong.

Bon Ap!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The owner is of the same family that owns Tomaso's on camelback and brings those fresh flavors and the Sicilian approach to a new restaurant, along with the bravery to put a modern twist on an otherwise well done Sicilian American concept. The arancini (fried risotto balls) are delicious and you can taste the attention to detail in each morsel. The meatballs, whether you're going for Italian sausage or aged ribeye, are flavorful beyond belief and pair well with just about any sauce there. A tip I can give to further your experience there is ask your server or bartender what their favorite combination is. Sometimes you may be surprised by something a little strange at first, but as soon as you try it, you'll be a huge fan of the Sicilian Butcher as well!"}
{"text":"Took some family here for their last night in Phoenix. We had a great time.  Sat outside, atmosphere is fantastic.  Plenty of heaters for the Arizonans!  My entire crew wants to come back to try more.  Specially cocktails were amazing.  I ordered the Italiano... thumbs up!  Appies were tasty, recommend the eggplant parmesan.  Meatballs, meatballs, meatballs.  AMAZING!!!  Sauces and pastas were fresh and flavorful.  It's not possible to order a bad combination.  We were too full to order dessert, but will definitely be back to try them.  Great new restaurant, definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Our first time at this great place and we definitely will be back. Love the concept and the menu is excellent, even if you prefer something other than meat. Made-in-house pasta was delicious and loved the selection of sauces. I had the sausage meatballs with arrabiatta sauce over paccheri pasta( large tube pasta). Excellent friendly service, first rate ingredients and a great menu make Sicilian Butcher a must visit."}
{"text":"My first visit was last night. It was superb. I grew up in NY and I travel a
Lot. Have been to the best of the best Italian restaurants in NY NJ MIami Ft Lauderdale. La. The Hill in St Louis and by FAR the best Italian food I have ever had was at this place. Their rose Sangria is wonderful. The food is among the best of the best of the BEST.  Service is superb. The people there are incredibly caring and friendly. You may have to wait to sit down but believe me it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the food is even better! I had the aged steak meatballs with the mushroom cream sauce and gnocchi. Sooooo good, we will definitely be back in the near future. Also the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Wanted to like the Sicilian Butcher and thought we would like it based on other reviews. First of all the service was terrific and their aim to please was evident. The good was just \"ok\" as expressed by all five in our party. We started with the meat and cheese board which was the perfect compliment of sweet and salty including delicious pickled fennel. The main courses were disappointing as I could not wait to taste the homemade pasta which was tasteless and the accompanying marinara which in  my opinion was bland. We tried the eggplant meatballs and the turkey meatballs which everyone agreed were not good. Really disappointing as the environment was welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo delicious! I would normally never order anything but a red sauce with meatballs but we tried it and everything was awesome! The steak balls are unreal! Get the bucket of balls. The caprese app is incredible too"}
{"text":"This restaurant was hopping on a weekday evening; it definitely was a place to be seen. It has a rather \"neo-industrial\" look and feel. Not the most comfortable atmosphere, but not bad. We tried the Mozzarella Charcuterie Board to start. It was well presented and tasty, although it could have used more toast points. My entree was Tomaso's Sicilian Meatballs, with the Pesto Trapanese sauce over the Paccheri. The pasta was very heavy and starchy, but the meatball and the sauce were very good. Could have used a little more of the sauce over the pasta. Service was very friendly and attentive.  Overall, not a bad dining experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited The Sicilian Butcher after hearing great things from friends. The patio is lovely and has a ton of misters and ample seating leading me to think that maybe the inside was tiny but WRONG. It's actually deceivingly large on the inside and we were surprised that on a Saturday evening when they were rocking and rolling that we were able to get seated immediately. 

I ordered a Sicilian spritz which was delightful and they put this blood orange popsicle ice cube thing in it which would taste alot better crushed into the spritz but its a nice little treat. The hubs ordered some sort of beer. We obviously had to try these famous meatballs and we also decided to try their bruschetta. The bruschetta is where we ordered incorrectly -- it is absolutely nothing special at all and thats where I will leave it. The balls were very good and the homemade pasta was pretty decent. I would have wanted to try a flight of meatballs but I didn't see that as an option but I'm sure I could have asked and been accommodated. I like to think of myself as a meatball snob growing up with immigrant italian grandparents -- these are not my grandfather's meatballs but they are pretty darn good. The spicy sauce was on point as well.

The service is great, the ambience is fun, I was totally staring at a table that had ordered the giant moscow mule (what the hell is that? can that really be a bowl of moscow mule?) and the meat locker is a nice focal point for us big boned people. I think it is a bit of a higher price point given portion sizes but apparently happy hour is all day in the bar which is awesome."}
{"text":"We went tonight at 9:20pm and spend 15 minutes waiting to be ask for any server that move around, especially the waitress. that was attending the table in front of Us. Today was no busy like other nights, so really was a deception, we have a long day and want to finish with good ambience, good food and surrounded with family. The greater see the situation.
Really disappointed"}
{"text":"Ordered the sausage meatballs, with vodka sauce & paccheri noodles. The sauce was on point, the meatballs loaded with flavor, and the noodles perfectly cooked. Our server, Sam, was extremely friendly, and attentive. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here for happy hour! They best wine and bruschetta in town. Such great quality for the price! Emad is our favorite server and it's always so personable"}
{"text":"Just had one of the best homemade pasta dishes I've had in years. This restaurant is must for anyone who loves Italian food, warm friendly staff form host to busser our server Laura was the best."}
{"text":"Lunchtime lunchtime  lunchtime and recommended by a co-worker so had to give it a shot! I believe this use to be Modern Grove. This newly designed restaurant and Italian butchery concept was awesome! Since it was lunch I had a time limit , but the lunch menu offerings were amazing. From a variety of ways to make tour own meatballs to cured meats galore! I was thoroughly impressed by the cheese and meat boards. I could not resist so I went with the meat and cheese board with an assortment of other goodies that my picture will do justice. The service right when I walked in as sat by the bar area was outstanding! Nicole the bartender as courteous and explained the lunch menu in detail! Next time I will be in for those meatballs !"}
{"text":"I wanted to host a lunch for a Facebook Cooking Group with Arizona members.  I went to the restaurant and met with the owner Joe who was kind enough to put me in touch with the Event Coordinator, Deanna. I met with a fellow member and had lunch to see if we in fact liked the food.  It was good.  The deconstructed Canolli was really good.  So I called Deanna to set it up because we had about 15 members.  She was very nice and told me there would be a 10% set up fee for the table and 20% gratuity as an add on to the lunch.  When I sent the post out to the group, 10 people confirmed.  I called Deanna back & told her because we were under the 15 people I would just like to reserve a table.  She said I wish I could but unfortunately \"We just opened and we do not have hostess or take reservations right now.\"  I asked if she would kindly make an exception due to the fact that we are looking to make this a monthly event.  She said she need to call Joe ask if he could make this exception.  She called me back and said, \"Yes, they could hold the table but we would still had to pay the 10% service fee (even though the patio has a table already set up for 10) and pay the 20% gratuity.   I AM SOOO DISAPPOINTED.  I think that Joe's decision to charge a set up fee is a very poor business decision because it was to be our neighborhood restaurant!  I have now booked our lunch at Chelsea's kitchen and will no longer recommend Sicilian  Butcher, buy gift cards (which I did for Christmas), or go to his restaurant.        I appreciate your response Joe but there was NO error in communication.  Your first response when the number went to 10 was to say \"sure...we would love to hold it for you.\"  The fact that Deanna called not 5 minutes after my post is nice but you missed the opportunity.  My Italian mother used to tell me \"Pigs get fat...but hos get slaughtered.\"  Not good Customer Service Joe!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place with a few friends and it was a great call.  Place is an open concept with a view of the kitchen and a large outdoor patio as well, perfect for most of the time in Arizona.  
The concept is pick your pasta from a variety of 8 or so with other options like polenta, salad or muffuletta bun, pick your meatballs and finally pick the sauce.  Simple enough but every combination we got was delicious.   The best combination we found was the gnocchi, with the spicy arrabiatta sauce and either the dry aged steak balls or uncle Arthur's NY balls.
Craft meatballs...a game changer.  Did not try any of the bruscetta or charcuterie boards but they looked delicious coming out.  We did start with the arancini which were good but our minor complaint (that other restaurants do also) is that there were 3 to an order which is difficult to split in a party of 4.  Either serve them in portions of 2 or 4, or have an option to add 1 if desired.
Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but good food and fast service.  They should add pesto to the sauce menu!"}
{"text":"Up in north Phoenix rare for us. Did a Yelp search. Read the reviews, decided to go. For  a Wednesday night, pretty busy. Lot of outside seating.  Cool vibe, lot of women versus men. Went with the suggestion of our server. Gnocchi Frito & Prosciutto appetizer, nice mix of flavors from the fried herb bread and prosciutto, $14. The craft meatballs are the main attraction.  We had the Tony's Dry Aged Steak Balls. These are made from ground aged ribeye. Once you pick your meatballs, then you choose your bottom. Pasta Al Forno, this is baked annelietti pasta with green peas, Sunday sugo, and fontina. To top of your top and bottom,  the sauce choice was Carbornara pancetta,  onions, English peas, egg yolk, and parmigiano. Nice blend of flavors, very cheesy, loved it. My wife and I shared this dish, $18. After all this we had to end our meal with New York cheesecake with a sweet Blackberry sauce. Trust me folks, this is truly NY Cheesecake, very rich and thick, $10. The owner Gino, stopped by and asked how we were doing, very friendly, same comment with the server, and person who set us up with water. Also saw, Luis Gonzales from the Diamondbacks. There is a reason why this Sicilian Butchet restaurant was crowded on a Wednesday night. We will be back."}
{"text":"We recently went to the Sicilian Butcher and would give them 10* if I could. The patio is lovely, the menu very interesting and the food was delicious! Our waitress, Samantha, was the best server we've had a in long time. She was timely and attentive. The manager, Gino, came to the table to be sure we had everything we needed. Be sure to order one of the boards - they're wonderful. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on the patio. Very impressed by the taste & quality of the food. Even the kids loved it! Great vibe and service. After seeing pictures on instagram finally tried this place. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This food was awesome and the atmosphere is super cool. We got a bruschetta board and the new your meatballs on fettuccine and it was incredibly filling. That being said, the best part was our waiter Gino! He had excellent recommendations, and was very friendly, patient, and entertaining. Highly recommend for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Awful just fucking awful . We get there at 9:20 they tell us the kitchen is closed . It's Saturday night and the place is packed and they close the kitchen . WTF. Never again I'm done don't claim your open till 11 and close at 9:20 ."}
{"text":"Tried out a new place last month.  I loved the ambiance and setting.  Not too noisy either, which is a delight these days since most restaurants have awful acoustics.

The food I ordered was really good.  I judge Italian restaurants by their ability to make a good Caesar Salad and they passed with flying colors.  Their artisan bread was fabulous and prepared perfectly.  I also loved the whole meatball theme idea and I tried Uncle Arthur's NY meatballs and they were fabulous with their Amatriciana sauce which hit the spot. One person at our table had the bruschetta and it was the best I have had.  With mushrooms, goat cheese and truffle essence - Yum!  Even enjoyed the chickpea fries.  Our server said some love and some don't because they expect them to be thin and crunchy.  I really liked them especially with their dipping sauces.

The only flaw was their Eggplant Parm balls.  Dry, crumbly and tasted like stuffing with little eggplant flavor.  Would try the Eggplant Parmesan next time in the traditional manner.  This one was a miss throughout our group.

Still going back to try other items.  Loved everything else!"}
{"text":"We went opening weekend and had a good experience. They ran out of a couple of things and were short staffed but it was nice enough that we went back. Our second trip was a whole different story. Food was lacking in flavor, there were 8 of us and we all ordered different things. We ordered the 5ft board but it was missing bruschetta, don't charge $14 a person if it's not going to come complete! Our server was slow on everything and even forgot we had ordered a glass of wine. Worst part was I spoke with the manager about our experience, he didn't even care. $235 later we left unhappy. I only gave 2 stars because our first time there was good. I hope they turn things around."}
{"text":"5 stars! 
This restaurant is seriously amazing. It was definitely needed in this neighborhood and has become my new favorite! There are so many great things on the menu that I cant wait to try everything. So far my favorite items are the mozzarella appetizer and pasta dish with sausage meatballs and gnocchi. The cocktails have also been unique and delicious. 
Customer service has been on point both times I've gone. The servers are always super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in making decisions! (Big decisions because everything looks delicious.) The atmosphere is fun and upscale. 
Some tips: Happy hour is only in the bar area or high top tables! They also don't take reservations and it gets busy on weekends so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Great service, great ambiance, ok food.. please see photo of you're looking for desert."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the Scottsdale area 4 weeks ago from New Jersey. Without a doubt this has been the best meal we have had since moving out here. The atmosphere is amazing, and the outdoor seating is just beautiful. We both got the New York Meatballs, which were so flavorful and moist, that they melted in your mouth. Accompanying my meatballs I did an Arrabiata sauce and Pachheri pasta. I cannot begin the explain how amazing the pasta was, they make everything daily and in house. We also ordered some bread which come out grilled with olive oil. Completely to die for. Gino the manager, comes to every table and asks how dinner is in his completely authentic bronx accent. This has been a little slice of home for my husband and I, we will definitely be back for the amazing food and genuinely awesome staff."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Service, food, atmosphere - the whole package!  The happy hour rocks!"}
{"text":"Great food in a spot thats easy to drive straight past such a great restaurant. Fab outdoor patio, too. Meatballs in particular were delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, good food and service. We'll be back. Many good things to try. 
Plenty of outdoor seating. Good wine selection. Didn't try the cheesecake but looked delicious."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed!  I had read a lot of the Yelp reviews and was excited to try The Sicilian Butcher.  We arrived around 5:45 and was told it would be about a 20 minutes wait... no problem and we headed off to the bar.  After a few minutes the bartender acknowledged our presents and gave us some menus.  Was excited to see an all day happy hour and was going to order some drinks.  Well after about 7 to 10 minutes and the bartender not checking back with us our phone rang and our table was ready.  Off we went to our table.  

Once seated we realized the Happy Hour menu was only available at the bar and we really wished the bartender would have provided good service by taking our order!  We decided not to order any drinks and when the waiter asked and we didn't order drinks it seemed like he wasn't too interested in us.  

We decided on the tomaso's Sicilian meatballs with the arrabiatta sauce and paccheri.  We also ordered the flora's salad.  The salad was very good.  Now for the meatballs....maybe it's because I'm of Italian decent and make amazing homemade meatballs... but The Sicilian Meatballs were not good.  Extremely tense and not tender at all.  The pasta was tasty however was a little too al dente.  

As for the service.  When the food was delivered we were not offered any cheese while we saw all the tables around us being given freshly grated cheese.  Our waiter did not check back with us throughout our meals.  

We did look at the desert menu and while we were intrigued with the olive oil cake tiramisu we thought $10 was a lot especially since we weren't pleased with some of our other dinner items.  

All in all I'm shocked at some of the other reviews that say the food was amazing.  
*****Updated Review******
Returned to The Sicilian Butcher 2/3/18 after being contacted by the owner Joey after he saw my review above and mailed me a gift card to encourage me to return.  The visit was much better and I will update my review with 4 stars.  We sat at the outside bar and were quickly greeted by the bartender.  We ordered drinks and appetizers from the happy hour menu and everything was really good.  

We will definitely be back again.  Thanks Joey for making it right!!!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness another restaurant opened up after Modern Grove closed in the same location. Even better is that the restaurant is beautifully decorated and their menu is perfect! Bruschetta boards, panini and meatballs..... yes, yes, and yes! 

We decided to order alcoholic drinks, a bruschetta board and meatballs with risotto. Everything was delicious except for the fact that the bruschetta bread was black and burnt and tried to hide it bu smearing the cheeses and jams on so they thought we wouldn't notice. The problem is that you can't hide the burnt taste in my mouth. Our server was fine. I think he was a little overwhelmed and didn't pay enough attention to us. I am not needy, but if we haven't seen you for the past twenty minutes and we are done eating, well, then service needs to improve in my book.

Our bill was over $50 because the alcohol was a little high but overall, the food and atmosphere is on point except for the burnt bread and service and so I give four stars. I'll come back and see if they have worked out the kinks since this place is still new. I am sure they can get to five stars in no time!"}
{"text":"Just had our third amazing meal here in tbe last 2 weeks. You can't go wrong with the meatballs, the Sicilian sausage it out of this world. I love the decor. It looks like the problems other reviewers have mentioned about service have been ironed out. Last Monday we had exceptional service from Randi. She seemed interested in us and had fantastic suggestions. Danny is so attentive and will not let you water glass get empty. Congratulations to the management. I previously posted that this was one of our top 5 restaurants. I think it just moved up to number 1."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker I had meh expectations but this place really is delicious. It's similar to The Meatball Shop but way better. The outdoor area with misters is awesome and super comfortable. Definitely try this spot out!!!"}
{"text":"Meatballs are excellent the best bang for the buck is rhe bucket of balls. Sauces are skimpy and pasta was stuck together-Ewh. Possibly the worst speidini I have ever had, it was burnt when it was brought out and so dry a steak knife was needed, the meat inside was delicious however it was not worth the PRICE. The parmesan sauces kn the mearballs is lacking. Do not expect to be on a hurry our waiter Chris was very personable and funny however the service was slow, items were.forgotten, water never refilled, menu errors, etc. etc. DO NOT be in a hurry. $$$$"}
{"text":"I had been watching and waiting for Sicilian Butcher to open up and couldn't wait to try it out. 

Arrived at about 5:30 in the evening and it was busy but they have a lovely patio that had plenty of room. Nice tents above the tables and heaters. 

Menu is nice but hard to follow. 

There was a lot of confusion about table numbers throughout the night and arguing between management and servers. The first time around, my friend was given the wrong entree entirely. I also didn't appreciate our servers negative comments about the management. \"Owners think they know everything\" was one of them.  

We ordered a charcuterie board which was really good. 

As for dinner entrees...not that great. I had the sausage meatballs with ribbon pasta and vodka cream sauce. I couldn't tell the difference between my sausage meatballs and Sicilian meatballs my friend got. I don't think I was actually served the sausage meatballs as they didn't match the description.  After the table mixups it's possible it wasn't even my order. 
The vodka sauce had very little flavor. I had to salt my entree a lot which I really hate doing. 

My friend ordered the carbonara sauce also with the ribbon pasta. Again, lacking flavor and needed salt. 

This place has a lot of potential, but the pasta sauces need some help. They also need to pay attention to table numbers to ensure that customers are receiving what they ordered. I'm quite sure I received the boring Sicilian meatballs instead of what I wanted. 

I am willing to return, but will give them a few more weeks to work out their issues and I hope they improve those sauces!"}
{"text":"I love going here with my girlfriends for some wine and bruschetta. I'm a vegan and I can eat their tomato bruschetta and pasta with marinara sauce which are amazing!"}
{"text":"Came with a few coworkers as we had heard good things about this place. Was quite busy so we had to sit in the outside patio area which was very nice and thankfully had several space heaters! Service was great and very attentive and accommodating for our group. I got the Uncle Arthur's NY meatballs which was a combo of lamb and beef with the spicy Arrabiatta sauce. The meatballs were good but nothing special. The sauce however I really enjoyed, good amount of spice for my tastes. The plate also came with a few toasted  pieces of bread which were tasty. Definitely a spot worth trying at least once!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. We came on the Friday of Memorial day weekend and the place was packed. Luckily we got there early around 5:30 and found 2 seats at the bar, which turned out to be a plus because happy hour prices are only good at the bar. Wow, the menu is very extensive. They cover all the bases here. We had the polenta fries and \"little vases\" board which were both delicious. My wife is not a meat eater so she had the crab and shrimp meatballs and I stuck with their classic meatballs. All delicious and very moist. We both got the bucket of meatballs without the pasta, We got 5 large meatballs each. A lot of food! We both took most of it home. The bread is outstanding and they give you plenty of it with every dish. What really impressed me was how fast they were. I don't think we waited 5 minutes for anything. By time we left, it was standing room only. This says something for this place because Memorial day weekend is typically a slow restaurant time. We look forward to coming back to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat in Scottsdale! The food and the service are exceptional. We have tried so many things and everything is made with excellence and tastes incredible. We are always greeted at the door by someone with a smile. Our waiters have the best recommendations and check in often to make sure everything is great. The meat and cheese board is something that looks like it's out of a magazine. Then the meatballs come...it's just absolutely heavenly. There are endless tantalizing combinations and you can't go wrong with any of them. We will keep coming back until death do us part. Five stars from our Italian family."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant!  I kept it simple with the Sicilian meatballs, marinara sauce and spaghetti.  We had the zeppole for dessert which were fried dough balls with Nutella dipping sauce - amazing!  Everything was perfect!  Can't wait to go back and try new things.  The menu was full of great choices, it was hard to decide.  Server had good recommendations based on what I told her I liked.  Everyone at our table was pleased with the whole experience.  I love the look and feel of the whole restaurant, too.  It was bigger than I thought it was going to be and the outside patio space looks great with big heaters to keep comfortable in the evenings! I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"We ate there tonight on a recommendation from a friend.  The ambiance of the restaurant is casual and very well done.  There is patio seating with heaters for each table, which is necessary when eating outside on a cool evening.   The service was fantastic, we had Gino as our server.  The food was very good and we were pleased by the variety of options we had for both appetizers and main courses.   We had the mozzarella board for an appetizer and it was amazing.  For the main course we had dry aged meatballs over thick pasta with meat sauce and lamb meatballs with Parmesan sauce and gnocchi.  It was a great meal coupled with a few glasses of wine.   We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars due to food and the fact that management corrected a slow start with class and finesse.  Gino was our server and he rocked when it came to taking care of us. The food is outstanding and I would recommend the grilled octopus appetizer."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened and I wish I came sooner! Came on a Tuesday night and every table was full. 
For starters our servers was soo amazing and nice.  I wish I remembered her name to give her some kuddos!  
My friends and I started with the Mozzarella board to share this is perfect for 2-4 people to share.  Everything was fresh and delicious. 
I am currently not eating meat and I thought I was going to be sh*t outta luck  (being called Sicilian Butcher and all) on entrees and have to settle for a salad but NOPE! 
I got the Eggplant Parm Meatballs (so freaking good i'm trying to make them at home) with arrabiata sauce and paccheri noodles (wide tubes).  The meatballs, sauce and pasta all made in house.  You can definitely taste the quality of the pasta - so good!  Came with three large balls and a good portion of pasta. This would be agood dish to split with one other person! I was able to eat half before I was stuffed but was happy to have the left overs for lunch (still tasted delicious the next day). 
My friend ended up getting the tiramisu for dessert.  Definitely not your traditional tiramisu but good.  It almost starts like a carrot cake taste then moves to the tiramisu at the end.  Also, helps that its layered with mascarpone :P yum! 

If you have been here come! Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"What a treat!! Food is amaze balls and ambiance is off the charts.  The live DJ jams!  This could easily become one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"A true European restaurant. The meatballs and charcuterie board are to die for!!  Our waitress, Samantha, was top notch. Ate outside on their beautiful shaded patio."}
{"text":"Great experience last night! They were packed but the food and service was terrific! The folks really know how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Most excellent meal!  Eggplant meatballs in truffle sauce over risotto was to die for. So many choices for meat, sauce and noodles....would love to try all!"}
{"text":"I have never written a bad review about a restaurant or service before, but I 100% do NOT recommend The Sicilian Butcher. My boyfriend and I went two weeks ago and had Gino, he was amazing and we had the best time! So two days ago I decided to take my mom and my little sister out for a nice dinner. We never have the opportunity to do this, and it was a special occasion. Our server was horrible. I mean the worse server I've ever had in my life, and I'm so upset two days later about the experience that I know I will never be back.

SERVERS ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO LARGE PARTIES! Sitting next to an eight top my server didn't write down the correct apps, didn't refill our waters, tried to buss the plates while we were still enjoying, and tried to drop the check without offering desert. There was something wrong with every stage of our not and I still payed 120$ before tip for the worst service I've ever had.

He told us the reason it took so long for him to get us water, was because of server stand up. I don't care about server stand up. He had a table. He should make it a priority to make sure we were greeted. I almost asked the hostess if we had a server. 

I never get to have a dinner with my mom and little sister. The moment was complexly ruined and will only be remembered for the horrible service. Never bring your family here. No care for hospitality or excellent service."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. The experience was fantastic. From the time we were greeted at the door until we left the entire staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was also fantastic and reasonably priced.  We had the bruschetta board which everything from the presentation to the ingredients and texture of the bread were perfect. We also had the pasta and meatballs which was delicious. I can't wait to go back to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Great food, was there on a Friday night and someone with a dog walked inside the restaurant and then they seated that person with a dog next to us.  Good experience up to that point but on a Friday night don't understand why they would allow that.  Also for happy hour $10 per glass for wine there are other places cheaper."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood.  Original concept with lots of options. Although it got crowded, there was no issue with noise level. Mozzarella board was excellent with very creamy burrata. I had the sausage meatballs - great flavoring with vodka cream sauce over polenta. The polenta was to die for!  My friend went back a few days later before leaving town. Can't wait to introduce others - have already spread the word. YUM!!"}
{"text":"Wow....am I excited to have a place like this in our neighborhood!

The platform of picking your meatball, sauce, and then 'bottom' is so fun.   Our table tried a variety of choices and all I can say is my Arrabiata sauce was fantastic....you have to like spicy though; and the gnocchi was the perfect base....not too heavy.   Re the meatballs, I preferred the Uncle Arthur version to the Steak Balls due to tenderness.   (I understand they used to let you mix and match the meatballs and it's a shame they've stopped that because that's one thing that would make the experience even more enjoyable.)  

We also started with the Mozzarella Board which was about as fresh and yummy version as I've ever had.   All of the charcuterie boards looked substantial and well thought out. 

My only wish re the meal is that they would provide bread with dinner to soak up all the yummy sauce; I know they have bread because the toasted bread served with the Mozzarella Board was outstanding.

And as a last thought, save room for dessert!    We had the deconstructed cannoli and the cheesecake and they were delicious.

If you're in the neighborhood you have to give The Sicilian Butcher a try!"}
{"text":"The Sicilian Butcher Craft Meatballs and Charcuterie Bar is a meatball and charcuterie inspired concept that has a build-your-own-meal experience. What does that mean? You can design your meal essentially. From the menu, you can build your own bruschetta board, charcuterie board, or create a pasta dish from a selection of house made pastas (bottoms), 8 different sauces (toppers) with 11 different meatball options, including a meatless choice of eggplant parmigiana. The pièce de resistance, especially if you have a large group, is to order the five-foot long Sicilian Butcher's board loaded with meatballs, cured meats and bruschetta. In addition to great food, the drinks are a hit. Sheldon Wiley, acclaimed mixologist and cocktail consultant from New York, collaborated on the new cocktail menu. We tried the Grazi, a colorful mix of gin, lemon juice, Italian red wine, strawberry reduction and egg white froth. And whiskey lovers might love the Italiano, with bourbon whiskey, averna liqueur, amaretto syrup and a splash of orange bitters that gets a smoky flavor imparted from smoking the glass on a white oak plank."}
{"text":"We came here a few weeks after they opened, and they were severely understaffed. The food took forever to come out, and you can see the servers were definitely overwhelmed.

The food was mediocre for the price, our bread was completely burnt, and one of the pasta dishes tasted cold. I'm not sure if this is because they were new and were rushing food out the kitchen, but the entire experience was subpar."}
{"text":"Chris was amazing!  Food is incredible, you have to come here!!  And the dessert... omg.
We are coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has only been around for a few months but it's become my favorite restaurant to go to. The meatballs are to die for and I have yet to have a bad dish. Things come out promptly as well. Word to the wise, you'll want to get there early on Friday & Saturday nights because the parking lot gets packed and the restaurant isn't taking reservations at this time."}
{"text":"First time at Sicilian Butcher and I will definitely be back. Amazing meatballs and pasta!"}
{"text":"Meh. Ate here twice on a business trip. Very good deal sitting at the bar but otherwise, food service and concept are over hyped. Beware the Panini. Spaghetti was forming one congealed ball in my bowl. At least both servers were honest and discounted my checks each time without my asking. Truly disappointing"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant going right now! We literally go 3 times per week AT LEAST. Must haves include: The Italiano (drink) - my hubby's favorite drink EVER, the bruschetta board (we love the fig and bacon one and the prosciutto and honey one), and the cured meat and cheese board could be the best appetizer I've ever had, and of course don't forget the steak meatballs and arribiatta sauce!!"}
{"text":"I love the food but...
We have been twice now. The neighborhood needs this trendy restaurant. The food is excellent.  The manager is wonderful. The first visit my waiter was great. Today, not so much. Worst service we have had in a long time. 
Our server was just talking behind the bar- it wasn't crowded. Only two other parties at 12:3o on New Years Day but we will be back. They did screw up our order. My husband wanted a sausage and the waitress brought out turkey meatballs. Mine was excellent. The pasta and sauce made from scratch. I'm sure the meatballs are a family secret. The restaurant is fun and trendy. Date night for sure. They own Hash Kitchen and a formal Italian restaurant at Camelback & 32nd that has been in Phoenix for ever. We love the patio. This restaurant adds class to the neighborhood.

1/12/18. We went back. Service much better"}
{"text":"Really, really, really good.  Super fresh everything.  It was very noticeable that they make all their own pasta.  The salads the others in my party got were very, very fresh.  Waiters actually had an opinion one what to get and how to mix and match the meatballs, pastas and sauces.  I know it sounds simple but have a waiter actually give you an intelligent recommendation in the Phoenix area is sometimes difficult.    

I can't say enough good things about the place.  You can tell the people that run it really care about the product they are putting out.  

We also got to chat up the owner.  Very nice guy from NY.  I would highly recommend this place both for the food, patio, feel and beverages."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Extremely slow. Very little sauce on pasta. Ordered more and it was $3. Not going back."}
{"text":"Did take out of their New York meatballs. They were very tasty. Came with a marinara sauce that wasn't too salty. Very modern appearance of the restaurant. Very clean also."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and the food is great!  The sauce using San Mariano tomatoes has a small kick and they have a huge selection of meatballs.  Sister restaurant to hash kitchen and Tomaso's-so ya it's good.  Great vibe to the place also-DJ on weekends."}
{"text":"Great staff, food, drinks and service. I will continue to go back.   I recommend this place to everyone and they love it too.   
*dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, reasonable prices! Happy to have a wonderful restaurant in the neighborhood. I will definitely be back. Our server Gino was excellent!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the service seemed somewhat amateur and incredibly slow. Dinner took us well over 2 hours, including a 20 minute wait to get the check! That being said, our server was very nice, it just seemed that no one knew exactly what to do. We had two servers bring incorrect food to our table - a mistake that we saw occur with other tables as well. If you can tolerate the growing pains service, the food is fantastic. We had the:

Mozzarella Caprese board - perfection. The burratta is the star of the show. The EVOO, cherry tomatoes and balsamic balls complement each other perfectly

Eggplant parm meatballs with arrabiatta sauce - delicious. Tasted just as good as the meat!

Uncle Arthur's meatballs with vodka cream sauce - yum! Perfectly juicy meatballs with a rich creamy flavorful sauce 

Cheesecake - perfectly balanced. Bright lemon flavor cuts the richness of the cheesecake with a sweet blackberry compote

For drinks:
Pinot noir
Pepe 
Grazi

Overall highly recommend! We will definitely be back. As an added bonus the setting is beautiful and right on trend with the decor."}
{"text":"Back again with friends.
I'd like to give it 5 stars but I can barely fathom the din of noise.
It's just too loud, too crowded and I really struggle with waiting more than 15 minutes.

But the food is really good, wait staff doing a very good job.
They seem to have ironed out many of the wrinkles of a new business.

I like the $5.00 glass of wine at happy hour, but only at the bar!!

I'll continue to come here, maybe try sitting outside or just keep wearing my ear plugs and expect less conversation over dinner.

Carbonara is a favorite
Gnocchi still the best"}
{"text":"Friday night, January 5th, I drove up to Tatum and Greenway to visit the newest restaurant in the Tomaso family of restaurants, The Italian Butcher.  What was Yogi Berra's great line about, \"...the place is so crowded no one goes there anymore\"...yeah, the Italian Butcher was so jammed that night, when the cutie at the door told me\"45 minutes\", I laughed out loud.  I wouldn't have gotten a friggin' drink in 45 minutes.  So I left and thought about a lunch this week.  
 
My biggest problem on January 5th was, shut out of The Italian Butcher, I went next door to Venezio's.  WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT CLUSTER-F***? This was HORRIBLE ITALIAN FOOD.  It wasn't amateurish, it was HORRIBLE ITALIAN FOOD!
 
Let me give you an example: when I dunked a meatball in the \"sauce\", I noticed the sauce wasn't really tomato sauce at all.  It was more like a brine.  My submerged meatball looked more like I'd dipped a French Dip in au jus'.  I admit appearances aren't everything, but in this case, it literally was not tomato sauce.  Again, WHAT WAS THAT?  I wouldn't go back to Venezio's. Ever. For free.  Not going back to Venezio's.
 
So 1/9/2017, I made it back to the Italian Butcher, no problem at 4pm, naturally.  At the bar. Now, I've been eating food all my life; I've been eating in restaurants about that long and I've even been in the restaurant business and I was never smart enough to think of a concept as simple and brilliant as a meatball restaurant.  Congratulations. 
 
Brilliant idea: the concept is, basically, pick a choice of meatball (based on meat composition)', a sauce (they call it \"top\") and a bottom (pasta).
 
The meatball choices are different mixtures of meat, sausage, veal, lamb, eggplant and a lump crab and shrimp meatball. I chose the Sicilian meatball, marinara and the mafalde pasta.  Basic. You know, Sound of Music: \"Let's start at the very beginning....\"

By 6 pm the joint was jumping, I had already given up my bar seat and another woman wanted to jump her for it, too.
 
Service was spotty at best; actually it was crap.  The young lady who took my order never, ever checked back with me.  Ever.  
I paid someone else. (The restaurant offers $5 house wine at happy hour, but was out of Cabernet.  Not a vineyard, not a preference, no Cab.  Hmmmm.)
 
When my food arrived, I asked for some crushed red peppers.  I was actually taken aback when a bartender didn't react immediately; why would he not?  Did he think I asked for something insignificant/ unimportant?  
 
4 or 5 minutes passed, I was getting pissed when I swallowed my anger and chatted with the guy next to me for another minute or two and then I snapped to this bartender: I said to, \"...send an f-ing busboy or something!  PEPPERS TOO MUCH TO ASK?\"  This is the result of poor training. And an entitled attitude. 
 
I got my food, AND here's your problem, Tommy-boy: 
                                  
                              NO TASTE 
 
                 AT BEST, YOUR FOOD AT 
                THE ITALIAN BUTCHER IS 
              FRIGHTENINGLY MEDIOCRE
 
All that great concept, very pretty restaurant and I would never come back.  No flavor. Ah!, the best laid plans...
 
My meatball looked pretty, and peppery but relatively tasteless ( I hate that Instagram looms so large, like appearance trumps taste. IT DOES NOT). 

The marinara was good but too sparse and when I asked for extra, again, everything takes 10 minutes, at The Italian Butcher (were the words, \"expedite\" or \"urgency\" removed from the manual here?) but the extra marinara really changed the flavor altogether, better.  The pasta was underdone.  Oh, did I mention they were out of Cabernet?
 
When I ate the first bite of meatball and sauce, I was so disappointed in the FLAVOR, and then it dawned on me: 
this is precisely why I haven't been back to ANY Tomaso's restaurant in 20 years.  It's mediocre and they never, ever charge mediocre prices. Tomaso's restaurants are the restaurants we avoided we because they weren't as good as the ones that we liked!   I got nothin' against these guys, I just think they make really mediocre, or less than mediocre, Italian food. You go there - tell me if I'm wrong. 
 
Last time: I went to a family dinner at Tomaso's on Camelback, like a day or two after Thanksgiving, like 15 years ago.  The chicken was dry, pasta tasteless.  So you can love all the Sicily you want, I grew up on Sicilian Italian food, this is not new to me, it's more original, more flavorful than northern Italian to me, Tomaso's just don't have the flavors I grew up with.  The Sicilian pasta I grew up with was so good,  would eat two or three plates.  I would eat until I couldn't eat anymore.  Not here. 
 
You go.  It's so popular I've seen online at least 2 price increases in the short tie they've been open. I swear I saw a menu all meatball platters (my word) $15. Not anymore. 

It's the latest and greatest.  Sicily? Yes, dammit!  Tomaso's Sicilian?  NFW!"}
{"text":"I think we will be making this place our go to after our morning services.. the meatball caesar salad combo was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Let me start with this- food is great! Happy hour is great! My only complaint is service, both in the restaurant and at the bar 

I live in the neighborhood and am excited that there is a restaurant doing well in this location. However, I fear it will not continue that streak if the service does not pick up. After several minutes of waiting with no acknowledgement (I almost left) a drink and food was finally ordered! Food was dropped off and not a single person asked me how it was. Very disappointing. Maybe my expectations are too high. I really really really want this restaurant to succeed!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough praises about this resturaunt! 
So AMAZING!! 
Have ricotta stuffed gnocchi with carbonara and eggplant meatballs  
Mmmmmmmm
And boyfriend had polenta with mushroom sauce and house meatballs. 
So rich and full of flavor.
Already planning for dinner there in asap.
Btw. 
The $5 All day every day chardonnay is great!!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of five on the second night they were open - we drove across town because we were intrigued by the menu, and we were not disappointed.  The place was hopping - lots of customers, but not huge waits.  Nice décor - modern and comfortable.  This time of year, the glass wall was open and lots of seating outside.  We managed to snag a table close to the food prep area (which has a glass wall - that says a lot about the confidence in their food prep team!).  Our eyes were huge from watching all the delicious plates coming out of the kitchen.  Everything is house-made! 

Service was amazing - if you go, you must ask for Gino's table.  He totally made our evening.  He knows his food - he knows good service - he can take a lot of smack-talking. My kind of server in a modern Italian bistro! 

We started with two appetizers - the charcuterie plate and the polenta plate (4 meatballs on a bed of yummy, fluffy polenta).  Wow.  We really took our time debating on what to order for our entries. 

The online menu only shows their \"balls\" menu - and impressive that it is!But they also have other specialty items, paninis and salads.  But we were there for the meatballs.  I had the sausage balls on mafalde (wide ribbon pasta) and the vodka crème sauce.  Wow.  Others from the team ordered the lamb meatballs; the lump crab and shrimp; and the NY Uncle Arthur's meatballs.  The Sunday Sugo sauce was amazing. So many different combinations that you know we'll be back!  

We wisely opted to save half our entrees for take-home, so we could have room for dessert.  5 people = 5 desserts!  And we were not disappointed.  The expresso cream was so light, creamy and a perfect portion.  The smores were super!  The deconstructed cannoli's were a hit (but still a little sweet for my taste).  Everything was a delight. 

It was worth a drive across town - we will be back because there are so many more options to try!"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place is good but they artificially make it busier than it really is. When you show up at 5pm and there's clearly open tables but they hand you a buzzer instead and say it's a 25 minute wait... No thanks. There's plenty of awesome food in Phoenix/Scottsdale so no one has time to put up with that bs, especially when Tutti Santi is right down the street."}
{"text":"Today went there for a late lunch early dinner. Sat outside on the back patio. Tables 1/2 full. Not busy not dead. Sat down at 3:30pm. By 3:50 I noticed the manager going around asking other diners how their meals were. Not talking to us due to the fact we had no food on our table. I got her attention and asked for a server, she acknowledged me. 5 mins later the water guy came and filled our glasses.  5 mins later a waitress \"not ours\" filling in for Christine asked for our drink order & brought the drinks back in 5 mins. 10 mins later I looked at my watch and we had been there 40 mins and still had not ordered or seen even seen Christine. That has to be the worst service ever. Even after telling the manager, it still sucked. I hope they work out the kinks because it doesn't matter how good your food is... if it is... you need to work on the lousy customer service. So disappointed!! 
Two weeks later no reach out from a manager...  it tells you they are not into quality service and mass production. I guess the are hoping  the people visiting don't do yelp. Good luck."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!! The food is really good but the service you receive for the price you pay for a meal. Not worth it. I came with a party of 6 and had ALISHA as our server. Not only was she rude but had to continually ask other servers for assistance as she was no where to be found and when we did see her never checked in at our table. I understand when a restaurant gets busy and you have to wait but they weren't busy and when she made mistakes like spilling a full beer and grating Parmesan that got in our drinks... you would think that maybe she would say \"gosh I'm so sorry let me get you a new one\" and make it a priority to replace but yet sat there until we had to remind her for a 3rd time to bring us a new drink. My daughter then ordered a sprite and not only did I ask multiple times for it she then brings out soda water and when I tell her this is not sprite her response is well the sprite outs. So you don't think to mention that when we order it. I could go on and on about how terrible the service was but it just infuriates me how much we spent that day and how terrible the service was. If you do choose to eat there make sure you don't get her or order take out."}
{"text":"Exceptional food & exceptional service!! Went in date night with my husband and from the hostess to the bartender to our server to the food - wonderful experience all around! Beautiful cheese board and the classic marinara and meatballs were a wonderful treat!"}
{"text":"This is the most delicious restaurant I've eating at in a long time. From the charcuterie board to the deconstructed cannoli.. simply marvelous! If you haven't gone there yet, you most go now! I can't wait to eat there again soon."}
{"text":"You, yes you, scrolling through Yelp trying to find a place to eat right now. Stop. Stop right now. Look no further, don't even waste your time because it's too hot in Phoenix and you  don't  have  time! 

This place right here just rocked my world. Like, I came across it expecting that it would be good but I had to take a moment of silent for the dinner I just had. It was everything and then some! 

Okay so it's a meatball and charcuterie place. So guess what I got? Meatballs and damn charcuterie! I chose the most popular charcuterie board which cane with a crap load of stuff. (By the way, I came alone so I of course didn't finish everything) the board was soooo good. I am a sucker for goat cheese and they drizzled it with honey WHEW! My god. Who needs a man when you have a charcuterie board? You know what I mean?! 

The meatball....OUT OF THIS WORLD. Forgive me for not knowing the name to Anything I ordered but it had NY in the name. It was one of the expensive ones with like three different meats. SO GOOD. 

Notable mentions: 
1. the music was BANGING. Okay? All they played were bangers. I was jamming away eating my meatball. 
2. The staff. Everyone was so nice! Ugh. I will definitely be back.! 
3. Happy hour all day every day if you sit at the bar or a high top table. HELL YEAH"}
{"text":"The Sicilian Butcher was an amazing, delicious, rambunctious, and mouth-watering experience. The pasta, perfecto, and the meatballs--they were massively delicious (per the 12 year-old). Kid friendly, but definitely a place where we'll be back with friends. Gino, our server extraordinaire, was the best we've ever had. Attentive to our needs and prompt in service, we felt like family.
I had no idea that the son of Tomaso's owned this eclectic, but traditional Sicilian restaurant. We celebrated our first Valentine's with the father, now we are celebrating our 21st with his son.
Thank you to everyone for making our night memorable!"}
{"text":"Sicilian Butcher has only been open a little over a week at the time of this review (December 2017). Given the owner-connection to Hash Kitchen and looking at some photos, I expected an environment very similar to what you'd get at THK - complete with the mandatory DJ. And yes, that is indeed pretty much what you get - not that there's anything wrong with that.

Arriving on Saturday night at 7pm, the place was quite packed - far more crowded than I expected. The setup of the restaurant is very similar to what you'd see over at Mora Italian. Modern, sleek, thumpy, and active. Unfortunately, the place was a bit of a mess when we walked in. Lots of people were clogging the entryway (not their fault) because of multiple families standing around in a disorganized line waiting to put their names in. This created a lot of confusion about where to go and what to do. We were quoted 45 minutes for a table, but it ended up only being ten. We were seated outside, which I would have balked at if they didn't have decent heaters for this particularly cold evening.

My girlfriend and I decided to try some of their bruchetta. At 15 dollars, we were able to sample four different styles. The red peppers, goat cheese, and herb pesto was easily the best of the four, with the wild mushroom and fried leeks also being decent. The dates, ricotta, and bacon variation was fine, while the prosciutto, honey, and hazelnut combo that I automatically assumed would be the best actually ended up being the worst. I'm pretty sure they forgot to include the honey. Strangely enough, just as we were about to finish the board, another identical board was brought out - until the server realized that we had already received it. They then quickly rushed it away, presumably to be wasted. They're new, so these kind of hiccups are to be expected, I guess.

After studying their menu, they seem to be going for the whole step-by-step/choosing process that enables you to build your own pasta and meatballs. You pick the meatballs, you choose the sauce, as well as the pasta. This can be a bit of a lottery of sorts if you don't know exactly what you're doing.

My girlfriend played it safe and ordered the Tomaso's meatballs with marinara sauce and spaghetti alla chitarra. This is probably the safest and most traditional creation one could sample. On the other hand, I opted for Uncle Arthur's meatballs which are a bit pricier due to the inclusion of lamb. I chose the arribiatta sauce, which would be basic if it weren't for the addition of calabrian chili. 

My girlfriend said her spaghetti was good. Not great, but good. Quality of the pasta was fine, while the sauce was just standard in comparison to some of our other favorites. My arribiatta sauce was a bit too spicy for me, so I suppose that's my fault for not ordering something more safe. What really helped these dishes, however, were the meatballs. They're generously sized, flavorful, and very light. I guess that's why some people have the option of just ordering a bucket of them if they so choose.

For dessert, we chose the olive oil cake. It was just okay. It has the dryer and dense texture of an angel food cake. We both loved the inclusion of the housemade honeycomb, but for ten dollars, I doubt it's something we'd order again given its size.

For this area, I'm sure this place will do incredibly well in the long run. And I'm guessing that, at some point, my girlfriend and I will return to experiment with some of their sauce-pasta combinations in hopes of getting something that really impresses. Perhaps things will be running a bit more smoothly by that time.

Recommended to check out."}
{"text":"This place was perfect. Beautifully decorated. Lively. Reasonably priced. Friendly. Great ambiance. Great drinks. Now the food! So delish. We ordered the standard meat and cheese board to start and it was plenty of food for 3 or 4. The Uncle Arthur's NY meatballs were outstanding with the mushroom cream sauce on Cavatelli noodles. My friend had the gnocchi and it was a must try. Gino, the manager, made his way around to all tables and checked on our visit. He was so nice and, I think, authentically Italian. We did not sit outside one the patio but will next time, the space is perfect with a DJ and misters. You've got to go!"}
{"text":"So here I am 2 days later with Beth for lunch and trying another variety. Pasta and meatballs of different types we both have asked. Busy lunch time. Everything was really good. Unusual food items here and we both liked everything."}
{"text":"Our neighbor redeemed herself with this recommendation. Great concept. Cool place and totally delish!"}
{"text":"Pasta was home made and perfect. Sauce was delish. Those meatballs though...holy crap. I'm not usually a meatball orderer but these are the best I've ever had. Service was fantastic. Just overall amazing. Worth the wait"}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back! The food was incredible. We had the Charred Octopus with shaved fennel, potatoes, pickled red onions, olives, Chiles...all drizzled in oil! Of course we couldn't pass on the charcuterie board...fresh mozzarella anyone??! Ordered the sausage meatballs which had just the right amount of spice! The pasta was perfection. Of course we couldn't leave without dessert and the Tiramisu did not disappoint! We will  be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  High energy!  Great food, tasty meatballs, fantastic bartenders!!!  Put this on your to do lists...it's fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"The food buzz I have is making my eyes roll into the back of my head! AMAZING food and service! The meatball and polenta board as well as the charcuterie board are perfect for date night sharing. I really have to commend the waitstaff for being so accommodating to me on their opening night. They went above and beyond   when they didn't need to. I'll be back for that as well as the bread...I could eat mounds of the bread!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my post a few weeks back.  We were invited back by management and asked to give the Sicilian Butcher another chance.  I had the Uncle Arthur meatballs with ribbon pasta and parmesan cream sauce, my son had the same meatballs but with Fettuccini noodles and marinara sauce, and my husband had NY meatballs with same sauce as myself and noodles as our son.

I would say the meatballs are the star of the meal. The fettuccine was much better this time, soft and not clumpy.  The ribbon pasta was okay, I think it was just my personal choice and would stay with the fettuccine.  

The management was very kind and brought a special desert called St. Joseph, It's basically a cream  puff with a flavorful cream inside.  

The waiter Gino was great.  I am happy to say this visit was much better than the first time.  I appreciate the management wanting to make it right abd you could see it in their service tonight.  

Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"As a Realtor and Foodie I am am always looking to find new Restaurants   to try as the good ones are were people want to be and live close to.  This is great addition to the Greenway and Tatum corner.  The ambiance of the restaurant is beautiful with a great bar that flows into the outside patio that makes their happy hour a lot of fun.   Service was solid very friendly and knowlegeable 
We had  table of 6 and ordered the mozzarella appetizer it was the perfect start.  All of the meatball and pasta dishes that were order were very good especially the gnocchi."}
{"text":"Meatballs are amazing! Also had their cheese and salami board which was delicious! Great ambience, great central location."}
{"text":"Tried this new place out with a friend on 3/11/18.  My friend ordered the eggplant panini and I ordered the eggplant parm app.  The panini was not a panini.  It was eggplant parm on a bun of some kind with sesame seeds on it.  Don't call it a panini if its' not a panini.  My friend was not happy with her food as it was hard to eat and she had to take it apart to eat.

My eggplant parm was so salty I couldn't enjoy it.  A few nights later I had eggplant parm at Picazzo's and it was soooo good.  The Sicilian Butcher needs to go to Picazzo's and learn how to make tasty eggplant parm.

We wanted to get some dessert so we looked at the dessert menu which is a separate menu.  Why not have the menu selections in the same place so you don't have to wait for your server to bring it.  Well everything was very pricey and while we would have liked the cannoli we didn't like the idea that it was a build your own.  I don't want to build my dessert and then pay for it.  We asked how the cannoli came and our server said it was ricotta and some other things with some items and wafers.  So its' an Italian salsa????????

I live within walking distant but don't be back."}
{"text":"Yolanda our server was great and we got to meet Geno the food was excellent too!   We will be back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!  We had the bruschetta board and then shared a bucket of balls. Gino came out to check on our meal and was very friendly. So thrilled to have this local restaurant in our neighborhood. It's all about the service. Love! Love! Love!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat.  Staff are super friendly.  You have to try their meatballs.  Super moist and flavorful with so many varieties of meat, sauces and pastas.   I will be here again next weekend."}
{"text":"Thanks Joey M for responding to the post. Not sure I can add anything more to the review. My daughter has asked that we give it another try because the food was good, except that the sandwich my wife ordered did not have the pesto sauce on it, hahahaha. So we are going to come back for another try and hope you have the gnocchis. You know what they say, screw me once shame on you, screw me twice, shame on me.  I hope this isn't the case.."}
{"text":"I bopped in at around 2:30 last Wednesday with my curiosity hat, like I often do with new Italian eateries in The Valley. In my 50's and a native New York Italian from the Five Towns (Woodmere-Hewlett), I'm hard to please because I'd just as soon make any Italian dish myself. The best part of the afternoon is I sat down at the bar next to a wonderful NY Italian couple, my age and also from Long Island/Queens. We went to the same Catholic grade school,JHS and she went to Hewlett HS!! Crazy small world. We traded stories and agreed on our biggest curse/blessing - for Italian's, especially NYer's - life revolves around food. Being obsessively picky about food is an unfortunate burden, believe me.

I've been going to Tomaso's since the late 70's where my parents were weekly customers. I love and trust Tommy and applaud the concept of Butcher. The negative reviews about poor service come from form-over-substance customers. It's a new restaurant working out the kinks - so get over it . . . it's the food stupid !! 

So the food . . . I got a bucket of the Sicilian Meatballs. My grandmother  (as do I) made hers with three meats, raisins and pine nuts. Tommy does as well, but there were no raisin or pine nut in mine. The taste, texture and shape were good - not great (at all). It didn't occur to me when I ordered that an aluminum bucket filled with meat would be so unappetizing (it is!!) PLEASE re-think that dish. Also, please use small pieces of stale bread - no breadcrumbs. I ordered the eggplant parm next (always my test dish to order) Sadly, it was horrible. I only had one bite. Btw, West Coast eggplant are tasteless anymore. Unless you salt the hell out of them, they are not worth serving. 

Anyway, I'll be back and soon. I'll try other dishes and hopefully find my \"go to\". Unlike, Mora on 7th Street. Ugh!! Who screws up Caponata !?! I mean,seriously. Dealbreaker. 

Tommy has earned my loyalty. He was wonderful to my sometimes cranky Dad way back in the day. So, I'm rooting for The Sicilian Butcher. It's a process : )"}
{"text":"Nice place inside and out. Lots of bruschetta choices. Like that you can make your own pasta dish. I had the steak meatballs with vodka sauce, super yummy. Wish the wine list had more choices, I was hoping for a chianti classico. Had the tiramisu. It was bland and tasted like chocolate cake and frosting, which I can't stand. Expected better from an Italian place. Would go back for the food. A little pricey for what you get. The service was great. Shawn was a funny server, I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Awesome food great service!  Diane was great!  I will be back.  I had Tomasos Sicilian meatballs with the Marinara.  Huge portions.  I also had the Sicilian Panzelka Salad which was huge and amazing.  Great decor."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove by the Sicilian Butcher and decided to have an impromptu lunch. This newish restaurant on Tatum & Shea has a lot of personality! Butcher knives as decor, open kitchen and indoor/outdoor bar and patio. It feels a little fancy, but not stuffy. Kids are welcome too. 

Staff was friendly and our waiter told us that their main focus is on meatballs. You choose your meatballs (traditional, seafood, veggie, turkey, etc) your sauce (at least 6 kinds) and your \"base\" (various noodles, risotto, and more). They also have meat and cheese boards and bruschetta. And paninis and salads! 

My husband tried the Sicilian meatballs (comes with 3 large) with fresh fettuccine noodles and vodka cream sauce. He said the pasta was really good, the meatballs too, but the vodka sauce was bland. 

I had what's probably the best deal on the menu, a salad, and you have the option of adding meatballs on the side for $4. You get two meatballs, as opposed to three for the regular order, which run $16 - $18. I had the Sicilian salad, which was sort of an Italian nicoise. It was on arugula, which I love, and green beans, potatoes, red onion, fennel, tomatoes, olives and a vinaigrette. For the meatballs I tried the steak balls in the arrabiatta sauce. The sauce was good, but could be spicier. 

Overall a great experience, if a little pricey. We will go back to try the charcuterie!"}
{"text":"I'd go back just got Cody behind the bar, attentive and personable to everyone he served. The food is amazing and a great drink selection, and sitting at the bar is a great deal with Happy Hour all the time."}
{"text":"I visited last night for the first time and I thought the menu was very creative and the food was great for the price. I've seen comments about the price below being too high, but the portions are big! I highly recommend and this will be in my rotation of restaurants for sure! Sicilian Meatballs were great..Eggplant Parmesan was also delicious. The pasta was on point as well."}
{"text":"The food is very good! The wait staff was able to make great recommendations about the meatballs, the bruschetta board leaves more to be desired but the potato croquets were AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome time at this restaurant. I really enjoyed the ambiance of this place - the outdoor patio looked so cool, but too bad you can't enjoy it during the summers out here in PHX during the day. 

I ordered the prosciutto w/ fig flat bread. I definitely enjoyed this plate, however, it does get too much. By too much, \"too sweet\" after 3 slices. I wouldn't order it again if it was my main meal, I think it's more of a \"shareable\" dish. 

My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti w/ ribeye meatball. The meatballs were a bit dry, but the sauce and pasta was great. You can tell first hand that the pasta is fresh and homemade by just the taste of it. I've never had \"fresh\" pasta and this tasted a bit different than your spaghetti/pasta boxed from the market.

I definitely can't wait to come back and try something else in the menu!"}
{"text":"This is going to sound gross, but I wish I had four stomachs like a cow, because I did not want to stop eating.  Yum. Yay. Yum. Yay.  I liked this place.  We started with the cured meat and cheese board.  Every morsel was a new delight.  Savory, sweet, salty and special.  My friend had the Sicilian meatballs with Arrabiatta on spaghetti and I had Uncle Arthur's meatballs on mafalde with Ametriciana.  Each meatball was unique, tender and an experience in itself.  The sauces were at the top of their game.  For my taste, the mafalde pasta is the way to go.  Would have loved to have desert, but my one stomach was at its limit (and we had 2 \"to go\" boxes half full.)"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!! We loved their options of meat which is hard to find especially since I'm not a fan of pork. They have Turkey, Beef, Lamb and Lump crab/Shrimp meatballs. You get to choose your sauce and your pasta and the portions are huge. The appetizers were delicious as well. We ended the night with the Deconstructed Cannoli which was devoured by yours truly. If you have a taste for Italian food then u have to try the Sicilian Butcher. Delizioso!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food.  Service was slow.  The pasta was slightly under cooked and the sauce was average.  I had expected more."}
{"text":"Didn't meet my expectations based on positive yelp reviews I've read.
We arrived around 5 o'clock and waited 15 minutes to be greeted by the waiter after seated. 
The menu looks conceptually different. 
Based on price and the quality we were disappointed. I'm not Italian but meatballs didn't seem of home made quality. There are other entrées on the menu that I would be interested to try if I would return. 
Was excited to see that the patio is very dog friendly"}
{"text":"My wife and I were so excited to try the Sicilian Butcher as we live nearby and were anticipating the opening. We finally had a chance to try it for an early dinner and unfortunately we were disappointed. 

There was only two other tables in the restaurant, however, once seated it took almost ten minutes for a server to greet us. Once he did I asked about the scotch selection and he had to again leave the table to check with the bar- ok no problem, but it took forever for him to come back. We promptly ordered bruschetta, excited about getting the choice of four different selections - but before it cans were again disappointed as our plates had leftover food stuck on them, we had to flag another server down to get new. The bruschetta was mediocre, the blue cheese aioli tasted like mayo which was off putting the other selections were just ok. But it was brought out with a large hair in one piece so we didn't get to try all our options. Again not thrilled or impressed at this point, but we ordered dinner. My wife had the gnocchi and I the ribbon pasta with arribiata sauce. She said her gnocchi was flavor less and while I love spicy food, this was ridiculous! I could barely stifle it down without being miserable, which is saying a lot as I eat my share of spice.

We opted out of dessert at this point, paid the check of over $100 and left unsatisfied. We would love to love this place as it's super convenient and has a good concept, but it just wasn't worth it. Hoping things turn around and we can give it another shot as we are always looking for a neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Tried this with friends who live in the neighborhood...and who love this place. Lively \"trattoria\" atmosphere with a great streetside patio. Exceptionally welcoming front desk staff with experienced and friendly servers. I tried the eggplant \"meatballs\"...tasty but a bit heavy. Sauce was also flavorful but, alas, sort of \"gummy\". Perfectly cooked pasta. To be fair, they were very busy & the kitchen was cranking out the food, so perhaps my experience was just a misstep. Everyone else in our party really enjoyed the menu items they selected! Menu is clever (lots of \"mix & match\" pasta, sauce, & meatball options). Overall, it's a fun dining experience. We will be back...and we'll bring more friends!"}
{"text":"so far so good. will update as the night continues. the ambiance is great.  the wait was less than 15
minutes. the charcuterie board was quite large. and the rest of the menu looks awesome."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Great new idea by Tomaso's son. We all (4) had meatballs 2 Sicilian and two the NY. Sunday Sugo sauce for me which was yummy. Everyone was happy. Gelato for desert with caramel sauce was a nice closet! Can't wait for them to open at the Biltmore which is a lot closer to home for us!"}
{"text":"Everything I expected and more from the service, ambience and most of all the meatballs.  Our server was young, knowledgeable and energetic with great suggestions on wine and the menu. For as crowded as the restaurant was, we were in and out  rather quickly which was nice. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a waste of time and money!  We were hoping it would have been good as this part of the city needs a good restaurant but we were so disappointed that we left before our food was served .. even though they offered it us for free.  It took 10 minutes to get water!  When they finally brought us these \"breadsticks\", there was 1 and a half sticks in a small bowl.  Really??  Then, we finally got our salad it was horrible and thrown into these huge bowls.  The service was so bad!!!  Who is doing the hiring at this place??  We won't be back as well as our entire neighborhood."}
{"text":"The service was not the best.I would more than likely not go back until they have been open for quite some time. The waiter was not very attentive at all. It took too Long to get water and drinks. They were not very busy. The food was really good. If I go back again and the service is the same that will be it. I know they have only been open for a short time, but the owner has been in the business for quite some time. They should have had the service  impeccable."}
{"text":"We just bought a house down the street so we have been trying places nearby to see what will be our new \"go-to place\" is. This restaurant wins! Our server, Jessica, was great. She was on top of everything and very friendly. The food was amazing. I really enjoyed the cheese board and the veil meatballs. Then to top it all off the manager, Gino, came by and checked on our table twice. Talk about good service! We will see you all soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - I mean come hungry! You can't eat it all - even though you desperately want to! My husband and I ordered two different meatball dishes - both were amazing! Highly recommend on all fronts!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious and so welcoming! We sat at the bar while waiting for our table and were offered free bruschetta and a free beer! Then we got seated and ordered the shrimp and crab meatballs and the aged steak meatballs. The steak were definitely the winners. Get those with some red wine and any date will love you forever. You must go to the Sicilian butcher and you must go now."}
{"text":"This place is BUSY! My husband and I went around 4:30 pm on a Saturday to beat the dinner rush and it was packed already. We did not have to wait too long since it was just the two of us but I'd recommend going early or making a reservation.

The food was very good. We had the meat and cheese board appetizer, and we each chose one of the meatball/pasta combinations for dinner. We had coffee and dessert as well. Everything was very good. The dessert we chose was the sfogliatelle which was like an Italian beignet. I love that the coffee came with rock crystal candy to use as the sweetener. I also enjoyed the traditional crunchy bread sticks kept at the tables.

Our server Yolanda was very attentive and friendly. She even put a pack of the bread sticks in our doggy bag since she knew how much I enjoyed them. Yolanda made it a great experience and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very good pasta, very good wine. The service was very good, but the atmosphere seemed conflicted. When I went, it seemed like it was trying to be a nice restaurant, but they had a DJ playing music. The food was fantastic, but the atmosphere felt conflicted."}
{"text":"Fabulous!   Food was amazing and great atmosphere.   Bruschetta options are wonderful and a must try Definitely back again soon!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and loved it both times. If you are a charcuterie fiend like me you'll love it. Their pasta is also super delicious. My husband had the stuffed gnocchi and it melted in your mouth. I'm also a huge fan of the deconstructed cannoli!"}
{"text":"Our family was in Phoenix for a trip and this was a PERFECT place for dinner. It has an adorable outdoor patio with umbrellas and misters. It wasn't too casual but also not too fancy. We wore jeans and tops or casual sun dresses. A great place for a nice dinner out. The menu also has tons of variety so you can go as simple or as complex as you please. It also would be a great place for drinks and appetizers. I had the traditional meatballs with vodka sauce and stuffed gnocchi. I'm a huge pasta fan and I used to work at an Italian restaurant and this food was great. We all LOVED what we ordered and were stuffed by the end!! Our service was great and our waiter was very nice and well informed. We went at about 5:30 I think and we got seated right away. We keep saying we wish we had this place at home now!! I will recommend this restaurant to anyone in Phoenix or in the area."}
{"text":"Sooo yummy!  Do not skip over this place!  We got 3 platters & they took up our whole table!  Delicious & fresh food, crispy bread, balsamic vinegar balls that burst in your mouth, I was not disappointed.  Meatballs were moist & delicious, loved it on polenta.  Didn't try any mains, but I'd return."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night.  Went back today for lunch before catching our flight back home.  Food is really good.  Great sharing options!  We planned to take a pic of the Tiramisu but ate it too quickly ;) delish & overly sweet.  Coffee taste was mild & perfect!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, got seated right away. Beautiful atmosphere. We ordered the bruschetta for the appetizer. You're able to try 4 different toppings. They were all delicious! For the entrees, we ordered the Tomaso's meatballs, vodka cream sauce, and pasta al forno. Meatballs were delicious but the pasta al forno came with a lot of fontina cheese so wasn't a fan of that. I'd say order it with different type of pasta. Husband ordered Tony's steak meatballs, gnocchi and the sagu sauce. Other things on the menu but overall it was great."}
{"text":"This place would do well in any big city and to have it in our neighborhood is amazing.  Support this place it doesn't get much better.  The service staff is dialed in, the concept is on point, the location with an outdoor bar and lounge is perfect.  I wish the owners much success it is obvious they have put a lot of thought and care into this spot."}
{"text":"Came in today because I've been wanting to go really bad. Not busy becvwe went between lunch and dinner at 4.  Slow service, hair on my meat and cheese tray, meat was raw...... Beautiful restaurant and atmosphere but won't be returning"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!  We ordered 4 different items  from apps to dessert & every course was spectacular with a beautiful presentation! The young man that seated & served us was professional & enthusiastic & definitely added to our experience ...great ambience inside & out!!  I would have taken photos had I not been so excited to try each course...can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing meatballs!! Crab and shrimp with the vodka sauce is my favorite!!!
Service is always spot on!"}
{"text":"ASK FOR GINO. Phenomenal food, atmosphere, and service. I couldn't have asked for a better date night! It was so much fun and I really can't express how great the food was!"}
{"text":"Great service, I ordered the steak meatballs with veal sauce and fettuccine noodles.

Amazing flavor and very filling!

Will definitely be coming back to eat here!"}
{"text":"Wow oh wow, what a meatball! I absolutely love the concept here. Craft meatballs?!? Its by the owner of Tomaso's, so you know its going to be good. It offers several entrees, but the craft meatballs are where its at. You pick a type of meatball (traditional, sausage, crab and lobster, etc), a type of sauce (tomato, arrabiatta, pesto, etc), and a pasta (fettuccine, risotto, gnocchi, etc). I had the traditional meatballs, tomato sauce, and risotto. It was awesome. My husband's sausage meatballs and pesto sauce was even better. We waited for a while, but it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is simply delicious. Happy hour is great, the drinks are tasty, and the meatballs, oh the meatballs... They are perfect!"}
{"text":"Exhausted from a 1 hour and 45 min meal and the desert has yet to com.  Service is horrific and would not waste my time coming here.  They have been open 2 months now and haven't worked out the service kinks.

We are now at 2 hours.  They have gotten desert for 1 of 5 for our table.  No check, no stop by no nothing I have been standing at our table writting this review for the past 20 min and still no stop by.

Finally, almost 3 hours more like 2:50 and we have a bill and can leave"}
{"text":"Mid week dinner and the Sicilian Butcher was packed.  No wait for a table which was great. The dining area is a warehouse setting with many modern touches with a bar and  big wall wine racks.  Lots on exterior tables too.  My buddies ordered this board appetizer 5 Feet long OMG!  I had the meatballs and Fettuccine.  The desert was a trio of cheesecake, pudding and cannoli  filling with fruit.  It was all awesome and loved it all.  Gino the server was pure entertainment and kept us laughing with great service.  If your thinking about going somewhere else - fuhgeddaboudit!!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour, will be back again! If your hungry get the 5 foot meat and cheese board!"}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp and decided to give it a try we were visiting from California and wanted to try something outside of our hotel Fairmont. Family fun place, aesthetically pleasing and the food was delicious and great portions.  Our server was very nice and explain the process on how to select and place  your order.  My wife had the seafood meatballs and I had the steak meatballs the kiddos had traditional spaghetti and meatballs.  I don't remember the type of pasta I had but it was delicious with some type of white creamy vodka sauce it was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited The Sicilian Butcher last week for Restaurant Week.  The atmosphere/decor is fantastic, and we loved the DJ!  The music was great, and it wasn't so loud that we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I ordered the steak meatballs over polenta with the mushroom truffle sauce...it was disappointing.  It was pretty bland, and the meatballs were fairly dry.  In stark contrast was my friend's meal--Uncle Arthur's meatballs over gnocchi with Arrabiata sauce....holy s#*t, it was heaven in a bowl!  The meatballs were juicy and flavorful and the gnocchi were perfectly cooked little pillows of dough!  They'd told us the sauce would be spicy, but it really wasn't (and I'm very sensitive to spice).  It just had the perfect little kick.  I'm gonna go back soon and order that combo next time!  Finally, we were really impressed with the service and the fact that the owner (or manager?) came to our table and spoke with us for about 5 minutes.  So, even though I didn't love my order, there were so many things that I loved about this place, and I intend to go back soon!  Oh, and the wine pours are generous, which is always appreciated!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my sister and 5 month old baby, I ordered that plum salad I forgot the actual name but it was sooooooo good, I'm on a dairy free diet and the staff was wonderful helping me find a the right meal, I also got the meat balls and sauce and it was perfect the meal I am definitely coming back , only reason it's not 5 star is because the prices a bit high but worth the food and not very stroller friendly, the place is kinda small so it was a very tight fit. Definitely coming back on date night"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch today. Great staff, fantastic food and very creative cocktails. Des was at the bar he was fun and very knowledgeable. 

We will be back. ;)"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a casual italian place close by.  The meatballs and pasta are so good, though I haven't found a wine I like there yet (not to worry, I will persevere).  Given a choice, I'd pick Tommy's Place over The Sicilian Butcher because for the same price the food and wine is a little better, and it's not so chaotic and noisy.  However, if you're nearby I definitely recommend stopping in for a bowl of pasta and meatballs.  You will be happy."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good. Our waiter was friendly and entertaining. They have gluten free pasta which made me happy! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The meatballs were sheer perfection. The sauce was excellent. But, the pasta was tough, chewy and all pieces of the pasta were stuck back together in a congealed ball. With proper cooking, saucing, and plating, it needn't be this way."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint!! I was a regular at the previous restaurant so couldn't wait to see what Sicilian Butcher had to offer. Love the layout/decor! It was a busy night so had a short wait but fast turnover of tables. We ordered a charcuterie board to split that was outstanding! I had the sausage balls with pesto and gnocchi and WOW!!! Best gnocchi EVER!! Oh and how could I forget our amazing waiter, Gino!! He was super helpful and on top of everything! I'll definitely be back. Great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to enjoy happy hour here with 3 of my friends.  We arrived at 5pm on a Tuesday night when it was still 105 deg outside.  There were only two tables in the bar that would accommodate a group of four and they were taken by groups of 2 people at each table.  The only room was outside.  The manager would not give us happy hour prices at a regular table so the only option for us was outside or leave.  Seems like there was room to add  a couple more tables maybe for 2 (instead of the big wine barrel) so the parties of 2 wouldn't take up the larger tables.  We finally did get a seat at the bar but really wasn't great because is hard for a party of 4 to talk when sitting in a row at the bar.  Food was good which is why I gave 4 stars, but seating.....not so great..  If we do happy hour here again, we  will have to know to go earlier to get one of the only two available (inside) tables in the bar."}
{"text":"I have been dying to check this place out. The vibe is fabulous, loved the patio. We ordered the Flora Salad to start and intended to share the Sicilian sausage meatballs for our main dish. They both came out together (buzz kill). The salad was full of texture and flavor, really really good. The Sicilian sausage (not meatballs but rather a link, my bad) was buried in Polenta and lacked flavor. Our server never came back to check on us or the food, empty water glasses, empty ice tea glass, inattentive. A couple sat next to us and their server explained the menu and how to order which would have been very helpful so ask your server to explain if they don't offer. I will definitely go back now that I understand the menu better and hopefully report a five star experience. Stay tuned...."}
{"text":"Place is awesome!  Took the family fine for kids just super busy so if your kids are good to wait then you will be fine.  We got there just after 4:00 and got right in.  The meatballs were rediculous!!!  We will be back to try a board of meat or two.  Wine selection good, my only negative was they were out of the beer I wanted and the seat that we had was just off the reception area and was a bit crowded.  I think if they just moved the reception desk 90degrees it would be so much better and less awkward for those coming in to give their name."}
{"text":"We dined on a Sunday night and as expected, there was about a 20 minute wait which was better than we expected as the place always looks busy when we drive by.  We were able to kill the time by getting a drink at the bar and chatting with some of the other people waiting for their table.  Everyone seemed excited to get going and some of the people were there picking up to-go orders and had nothing but good things to say about the food.  After a few moments after being seated our waiter greeted us and was very personable and responded very well to our requests before ordering our food.  The food came out and the waiter said that the kitchen actually lost their gas for about 10 minutes and they almost had to close the restaurant!  Fortunately, it came back on and the food was fantastic!  The gluten free pasta was delicious and the Sicilian meatballs and Amatricana sauce were great as well.  I ordered a bruschetta board of the dill and salmon, ricotta and prosciutto, dates and bacon and the mozzarella and tomato.  I think the dates and bacon was my favorite but they were all good, and good portions as well.  Speaking of which, I recommend getting a board and an order of the meatballs to share.  That way you get the best of both worlds.

The decor and menu are fun and unique, the staff is courteous and prompt and I definitely think it is worth a shot if you're in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"The concept is incredible. The food is delicious. The vibe is what sets this place apart. The only issue- the waitstaff seem to be lost and they don't come to the table, if you're on a time crunch you can't come here for their amazing food because you won't make the deadline, the server if they come to your table they will get lost between the water refill and the order taking so unless you know what you want you better just know that you'll be there awhile. The food is amazing and breathtakingly beautiful. The flavors are beyond yummy. I've been 2 times in the past 7 days and well that says a lot. The food is efficient and the portions are huge. So I say go and enjoy and hopefully your waitstaff is better!! Happy eating."}
{"text":"Tonight was my third time to The Sicilian Butcher. The first 2 visits were fantastic. Tonight, something was definitely off. Once we were seated our waitress came over to get our drink orders. My brother ordered an IPA on draft, and it ran out, no biggie, she offered an alternative. My boyfriend ordered a coke, and had to ask 3 times before it came out. We ordered a bruschetta board that came out quickly. Our dinner on the other hand took over 45 minutes to come to the table. The waitress was visible and kept saying it shouldn't be much longer. Not once did a manager come visit. When it did come out, my mom's flatbread was dry and hard. You could see where they tried to cut off the burnt edges. She sent it back and they made a new one (and comp'd it), but she sat there while the rest of us ate. A manager did bring her remade flatbread. We definitely noticed people eating around us that arrived after us. While the food is tasty, something was definitely off with the kitchen or the service tonight. I'll give them another shot, but tonight was not a great experience"}
{"text":"Amazing patio al fresco dining.  Staff was excellent. The meatballs are an experience in of themselves."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it because of the location and the name but the Bruschetta was just okay (Postinos is better) and the spaghetti and meatballs my Husband ordered was way too al dente and didn't come with bread. I really don't think we will be back, which is a bummer because I wanted to have a new \"go to spot\" in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Chris our server was fantastic! New neighborhood spot for sure! Everything made in house, Great Italian wine. wonderful happy hour!"}
{"text":"New spot in my neighborhood that has been getting a lot of hype and I have to say it delivered. First off for happy hour they have an amazing deal that includes a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board for $19. The bruschetta is top notch too, amazing bread and tons of fresh toppings to choose from. On the entree side there is a nice selection of meatballs, pastas, and polenta that include a choice of sauce. It's nice to see a high quality Italian spot give you the freedom to make your own meal. Had the lamb meatballs on polenta with a vodka sauce and it was so good I didn't put down my fork once I just kept shoveling it on. The cocktails are amazing, the \"Italiano\" was my favorite. Solid wine and beer selection too. Went all out and had the pan a cotta and the deconstructed cannoli with pistachio and Luxardo cherries, again more shoveling. The service was great for as busy as it was Kelsie was awesome. I'll be back for sure with my shovel."}
{"text":"Great find. Fresh pasta, home made meatballs and lots of different ones. Fantastic appetizers. The outdoor seating is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Amazing. This place is located in a little strip mall in Scottsdale. MY GOODNESS is it delicious! Everything is made fresh in house. The place is always packed- but worth the wait. They're famous for their meatballs.. but it is actually their bruschetta board and charcuterie board that cause people to rave about them. The eggplant Parmesan meatballs are a must try- but they're VERY rich. Consider splitting with someone who gets a different type of meatball. 


Friday nights there is a DJ outside, and the place is hopping. Must try!"}
{"text":"Went in for a work dinner. Great service nice atmosphere with exception of it being a little loud in there. Didn't sit on patio but it was nice. Food was great. I ordered sausage meatballs in a bun. Had a little too much bread for the amount of meatballs. But I did try the pasta a friend ordered and it was delicious. Will go back."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight. Had charcuterie board, meatball & polenta board, bruschetta & potato croquettes (can't remember the name) - all the food was delicious! Our server, Emad, was knowledgeable about the menu, courteous but not overbearing - service was great!!! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Second time here! Just as amazing as the first time!! Great food and awesome service! The craft meatballs are all delicious! Try the turkey meatball with vodka sauce on creamy polenta! You won't be disappointed. All of their pasta is made in house and always made to perfection. The prices are reasonable for such a high quality establishment!"}
{"text":"Just left the Sicilian Butcher in Phoenix. Very good experience. Really liked the food, and the service was very good in spite of how busy they were. Very large outside dining area as well.  First time I have encountered \"craft\" meatballs. Very trendy, upbeat decor. Good place to bring a date.
Would most definitely come back"}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite place to get meatballs, well maybe the only place to get them. Still, they are fantastic with the freshly made pastas and sauce! You can't go wrong here if you're looking for a great lunch or dinner! The chefs really know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"They told us we were going to have a 30-minutes wait but in actuality it was less than 15. Gotta love meatballs as they have several different kinds with several difference sauces and several different pastas (or I had Caeser salad). Sam provided us wonderful service. The staff as a whole were very warm and engaging."}
{"text":"OM MEATBALL!!!!
Amazing!!!! 
Thank you  for an amazing experience!!!!
Service top notch!
Food RIGHT ON!!
Ambiance...super cute 
Shot out to my brother who found this gem!!!
Meatballs were generous and so yummy as were the other dishes 
Pick your meatball, pick your sauce, pick your homemade noodle/bun/polenta
Thank you for a great experience"}
{"text":"OMG!  From the time you step into the restaurant, you feel like you are home!  Dominic greeted us with his warm, friendly smile and proceeded to engage us to where we never wanted to leave.  He made sure that we found a seat at the bar and we were well taken care of.  Dominic is  a great asset to this already fantastic restaurant!  We WILL BE BACK!

{"text":"This is one of those places I wish we could just keep to ourselves, but I think everyone has to experience The Sicilian Butcher at least once. We went twice this past weekend and it did not disappoint either time.

The location is in a strip mall north of Greenway on Tatum. You will immediately see the crowds of people as well as the outside patio lit up with hanging lights and cooled with misters and umbrellas. Be prepared to wait up to 20 minutes or more due to the crowds. There is a full bar and you can grab a drink while you wait.

The concept of Craft Meatballs, created by famous celebrity chef, Joey Maggiore (The Hash Kitchen) is simple yet elegant. For additional reference, Joey is the son of Tomaso's owner, Tomaso Maggiore who hails from Sicily. 

Appetizers themselves are craft. The Polenta Fries with Marinara was to die for. On the Charcuterie side, the Meat and Cheese board was enough for four people to share easily. The jams on this board was amazing as you spread them across grilled toast points. The Pane Cunzatu (Silicon Style Bruschetta Boards) offers 9 types of bruschetta that you get four of. The four pieces are actually 8 total pieces in the order. A few of our favorites were creamy burrata with tomato jam and fried basil. Another that really stood out was ricotta with prosciutto, honey and hazelnut. There were also Flatbreads and Panini with various flavors or meats and cheese.

At this point, our stomachs protruded into the table and our ribs hurt, but muster on we did. On to the main course, the Meatballs.

To simplify it, you choose a type of meatball. You get three with a regular order and five if you order a Bucket Of Balls, which only comes with sauce.  Tomaso's Sicilian which was ground veal, prime beef, pork, pine nuts, raisins, pecorino cheese, garlic and fresh herbs. This is ground to a fine setting and rolled perfectly. There are no char marks, no grill marks - just a perfect ball. Another we tried was the Uncle Arthurs N.Y. Meatballs and the Eggplant Parmigiana Balls. All were excellent. Next step is to choose a sauce. We tried the Sunday Sugo, a normal bolognese gravy, the Marinara, which was by far our favorite, and the Pesto Trapanese. Finally, you choose your bottom. This could be a salad but why go there when you can choose from 7 different types of pasta and also a Muffuletta Bun. The gnocchi was stuffed with ricotta and spinach. There was also an amazing Ricotta Cavatelli. The Malfade (wide noodles) also was a hit with out group. You can only order three of the same type of meatball as we asked yesterday. They originally allowed you to order separate meatballs but it became confusing and time consuming. My thoughts, everyone in your party order something different and share.

If you have made it to this point, without wanting to crawl under the table and sleep, then finally, have the dessert. The Olive Oil Cake Tiramisu was an espresso and khaluha dipped olive oil cake with sweet mascarpone and chocolate. The Sfogliatelle was flakey and intense and each bite was savored. Lastly we finished with the Deconstructed Cannoli, which is pizzel cookies with a bowl of ricotta, chocolate, pistachio, candied lemon and cherries that you spread on the pastry.

For the kids they have a full menu. Spaghetti and Meatballs, Meatball sliders, Grilled Cheese Panini to name a few. The price was $8 for children and also included a drink.

The wait staff was amazing.  The bartenders attentive and the hostess was very friendly. The manager walked from table to table greeting people and making sure everyones meals were perfect. One thing to note - it does get very loud inside so if the weather permits, try and get an outside table. On Saturday there was a DJ outside but it was not too loud.

Enjoy The Sicilian Butcher. I guarantee you will be back again and again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The service was great! Will definitely be coming back. My only gripe, I wish the building was a little bigger to fit more tables. We had to sit at a high top (which is not my favorite) but that's okay because we got seated right away. The ambiance is really cool! My kids loved it as well. Would definitely recommend checking this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Best bowl of pasta that I have ever eaten. Fresh pasta cooked perfectly, and meatballs crafted to the highest form of culinary art. You've gotta give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I know I have written about The Sicilian Butcher before, but man am I blown away again! Their food is mouthwatering good. My favorite thing to get there is their Tomaso's Sicilian Meatballs over Paccheri with the Vodka Cream Sauce...thank me later but I switched it up a little this time and it was still in line with their normal perfection! I have family coming into town for my graduation later this month and we will definitely be dining in or getting some catering for our get together so I can share the amazing-ness with everyone I know!"}
{"text":"What an excellent place every time I come here. Great food , and all day happy hour - note: you have to be sitting at the bar to get it. Great service & causal ambiance. My vegetarian friend had a little problem finding menu items, but was able to get by with  a cheese board"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I'm sure it has a fair amount to do with the fact that it's a REAL restaurant in a part of the Valley that doesn't have much beyond fast food and chains. It also has a fun patio and live music.

We have been here several times, usually sampling the meatballs and pasta. I think I have had four of the 7 or so types and Uncle Arthur's continue to be my favorite. Some day I'll get around to Tomaso's Sicilian. Did I mention you can get a BUCKET of balls? Dang it, but they had me in mind. Top it with your favorite sauce and dig in with some bread. They are fairly large, so expect to take home a few. And hey, tell your SO to get their own, haha.

The pasta is made in-house and has been very tender, never over cooked and that's a score. The meat and cheese board is generously filled with cheeses, meats, olives, nuts and dried fruits. The polenta board looks amazing.

The last time I was there, I shared a bruschetta board with a friend and was not overly impressed with that. I thought the bread was a little to soft and the toppings were okay but not amazing. Maybe I have had my fill of bruschetta since Postino's introduced me to them a several years ago.

So... funny thing happens when you forget to post a review. You go back... things change... The food is still really good and I still like the OUTDOOR environment (just too noisy indoors and the misters have been very effective so far). But the service has been suffering lately. Slow, neglected, even on nights when they weren't super busy. If anything needs tweaking, it's the service. I'll still go back but will be prepared for waiting."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I've tried almost every sauce and have loved all but my fav is the Sunday sugo.. yumm and bruschetta boards are a must. The place is also beautiful inside and out!"}
{"text":"Wow! 
Meatballs, salad and pasta, oh my.
Our server Christie was helpful and attentive with explanations and advice. She brought Mom 2 full mini wine glasses to sample before deciding. The menu is seriously one of a kind. The quality and taste of every unique part of our meal was amazing. 
The space is awesome, a patio with heaters, canopies and great seating. Inside is spacious and comfortable. Did I mention family friendly and affordable!
Gnocchi, cheesecake and espresso. Oh my!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood!  Finally, something other than chicken tenders. 

Arrived a little before 6 and the place was already full but there was only a 20-25 minute wait.  We didn't wait even 20 minutes and we were seated...    Gino was our server and he provided excellent service, above and beyond!  We will ask for Gino next time because Gino himself is What kicked this review up from 4 to 5 stars.  Thank you Gino!

We ordered the bruschetta board, I believe there was 12 different choices and you could pick up to 4 for your board. Salmon, ricotta with prosciutto, bruschetta and the mushroom truffle goat cheese.  All delicious!  

For the main entree...  you pick your balls, sauce and bottom (pasta, polenta, gnocchi, salad, etc).  Hubs picked the wide ribbon noodles (made fresh in house) with arrabbiata sauce and sausage meatballs.  I swear when I looked over his eyes were rolled back up into his head...  finally an arrabbiata sauce that's actually spicy.  

Sorry, don't judge me, I ordered the traditional meatballs on Wide ribbon pasta with cream sauce.  First off all, this meatball was the lightest, moistest meatball that I've ever tasted.  I don't think I can eat any old meatball again. The meatball was perfect.  Sauce perfect and creamy.  Pasta al debate and so fresh.  

We had two desserts the Boudino - HEAVEN IN A BOWL.  And the deconstructed cannoli was enough for 2-3 people to share.  Very unique and fun but I prefer a traditional cannoli.

I hope you're hear to stay and keep up the excellent neighborhood vibe!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. What a great local spot anytime of the week. I love going and mixing up my sauce/noodle/meatball choices. Their gnocchi might be my new favorite must order when I go next. I highly recommend for either grabbing a drink/ bite with a friend or going out with the whole family!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Great outdoor space. Not comfortable seating outside though. My husband and I were meeting another couple we were told 45min for a table but the buzzer quickly went off. While we were waiting I had a drink at the bar, very crowded. I ordered a vodka on the rocks with lemon and lime and I was charged $2 for having it on the rocks. On top of paying the $10 for the vodka (which that part was fine)...since when did we have to pay for ice!!!! 3 of 4 of us got the Arizona Restaurant Week menu. They were able to accommodate my husband's request of only hard cheese on his charcuterie board. I got the bruschetta board which was delicious. Get the Sicilian meatballs they were awesome!! We tried the crab and lobster meatball but nobody at the table was a fan. I got the uncle____ meatballs which tasted like what you would get from your moms cooking, just plain good! The pasta which is made daily was perfectly done! All in all a good night. Best part to me is that they are dog friendly, good to know for next time!"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my mom and she's been raving about this place - I'm so glad we came to try it out. It's busy in the evenings and it doesn't seem like you can make a reservation, but we were seated quickly. The waiter was prompt and I was shocked how fast my cocktail came - less than 5 min. We ordered off the regular menu and kids menu - spaghetti and meatballs and eggplant meatballs. The food came really fast - which I appreciated since I was with my sons. Lots of food. Lots. Come hungry and plan to bring some home. It was excellent and I definitely will be back. Make sure you tell the owner hello - he strolls the restaurant and checks on the customers and is quite a charmer."}
{"text":"Food was good. They had a 45 minute wait for a Wednesday. We got the meat block and bucket of spicy meatballs. 
The service was friendly. We will go back. 

Update: went back for Mother's Day. We got there when opened. One of the owners was there and treated us like family. Service and food was great."}
{"text":"Another amazing meal! We have been here several times and tried a variety of sandwiches, meatballs, and appetizer boards- all are delicious! The decor is fun, outdoor seating abundant service impeccable!"}
{"text":"Chris is such an awesome server great food and will come back .great place and great locations .all the food was great and worth coming back for more"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Gino, whom I assume is the owner, stopped by the table to welcome us and again later to confirm we were enjoying our meal. Polenta fries were bomb, prosciutto panini was delicious. We also enjoyed a bucket of balls and a pitcher of sangria. We chose to sit outside, and despite the mid June heat, were comfortable with the misting fan. We look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Wow!!! As someone who is of Sicilian heritage I expected a lot and my expectations were exceeded by far ! The restaurant was busy tonight but Frankie the manager worked hard to make sure that everyone felt welcome and happy
Like I said , I'm Sicilian and I just loved the menu and the food. Try the spedini you won't regret it You can mix and match any pasta, sauce and topping. My only wish is that they would add Pasta con Sardi ( pasta with sardines) a Sicilian staple 
The ambience is to die for You can eat outside or in and The bar is really cool
The best part was the check which was oh so reasonable !!!
I plan to be a regular"}
{"text":"Bonnie is always welcoming and makes you feel at home...best meatballs in Phoenix and I don't say that very easily, as I take pride making homemade meatballs for my family!"}
{"text":"Love the patio and the food is awesome. I drove right by on their grand opening night because I didn't think a strip mall restaurant would be this good. Months later I had a business lunch and this was the place, I was amazed that it was not only really good but the service and the atmosphere were awesome. I had to bring my wife and kids and we sat on the patio (before it got hot) it was a great meal and my kids liked it too. They have those 360 misters so I think on a warm night with low humidity you could enjoy the patio. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The place is jammin' busy and for good reason. Excellent food at reasonable prices, with great service (when I sit at the bar).

I have walked up to that lone barstool wedged between two people, and get a prompt greeting, and a menu... during busy hours no less!

The social scene is a mixed bag of locals, and seems to be a hot spot for the random cougar.

Food I've had during both of my visits: the regular meatballs (bucket o' balls) w marinara, potato croquettes, and the meat and cheese board. Drinks, I have had my routine bulleit rye Manhattan, and Sicilian red wine.

The bartenders have been totally on their game on my two visits. Excellent bar service.

The place would get a full five stars, but.. I have experienced accuracy issues with my order (food runner). Also, I was almost served an order belonging to the customers at the mirror image of my bar seat. It was nothing to sweat over."}
{"text":"First time here and what an amazing meal. Gino and staff made us feel like family. From the meat/cheese board to the fresh made pasta and wide selection of meatballs.  Bring your friends, bring your family. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Wanted to say thank you to the owner / manager of the Sicilian butcher tonight. Just left there with my best friends elderly father that just lost his wife. They went out of their way two appease his persnickety request. thank you for the cocktails and the service"}
{"text":"I've reviewed this place over a month ago and was happy. As a customer at a table with a waiter it was fine. They took care of me quickly to move on to the next customers for the table. Tonight I sat at the bar after 8pm. When it was busy I got some service.  45 minutes later I had to ask 3 different times for a wine refill! AT THE BAR. Right in front of the \"bartenders\". They close at 11pm but don't expect anything other than how quickly they want to get out of there. The bartender commented that his 18 year old coworker is not moving fast enough. Speaking of the 18 year old, I  told him I had a problem, that my wine glass was STILL empty. He went on to tell me he's only 18 and can't serve alcohol. He's working behind the bar. I said \"well you know someone who can help me with that\" He never told anyone that I needed a refill. This whole end of the bar only holds about 10 people and there weren't that many filled seats. Management needs to train some people. Your large clientele now, will cease to exist in the very near future if you don't pay attention.  Modern Grove was good when it opened too."}
{"text":"Wow, very good food. Had the sausage meatballs, and the beet, goat cheese, and roasted fig salad. Everything tasted wonderful. Amstel light was ice cold. Service was great. Go early because it get busy for dinner."}
{"text":"I had the carbonara with turkey meatballs, which was very good! The ambiance was nice and the server was great. This is sooooo much better than Modern Grove!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, Blake, Frankie and Sam were excellent! The food was beyond good! You've got to try the dessert board!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying a group of girls and I strolled in on a Friday night and waited about 30 minutes to be sat (we did not have a reservation) all in all not bad. For those of you who have a problem waiting, it's the weekend grab yourself a drink and relax. This place was booming. The menu is extensive and I'm extremely grateful for that. The meatballs as everyone says are delicious. 
This was my first time here and My friends told me you choose a meatball, sauce and pasta. No matter what you choose you can't lose. Everything tasted amazing to say the least. 
I also ordered my husband who (also has never eaten here) something to go. 
He too raves about how delicious it was. 
Very happy to have found another great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Not a good first impression. We came for the happy hour and the hostess said there are no seats available, but you can \"wait here\". We waited for 20 minutes and then she seated someone who came in a side door at the bar. Really?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a large dinner or happy hour. They have the space and are geared towards big groups, that being said we loved our dinner for two. 

The food was fantastic and the wine and beer selection was acceptable (around 7 beers and 30ish wines). We had the chopped salad, aged steak meatballs and the deconstructed cannoli which were all outstanding. Full flavor and interesting profiles.

The service was prompt and they always kept our  glasses full. They were constantly checking in without being intrusive. 

Our only complaint would be that their menu was hard to understand at first."}
{"text":"Get the meatball bucket. Amazing sauces to choose from and you will be full for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday.  I had the Tomaso's Sicilian meatballs with spaghetti and aribiatta sauce.  The pasta was perfectly al-dente and the meatballs were light and tasty.  My wife had the fettuccine with the sausage meatballs.  Excellent!!!  Some of the best meatballs I have ever had.  Service was great... friendly and attentive.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Gino, Blake and Justin killed it in the service department. The cured meat charcuterie board, pfffft!! Phenomenal. Definitely will be coming back. The wife and I enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"The meatballs were unbelievable!  Awesome sauces!

This is coming from a  second generation Italian.  

If this is your first time, try each of the meatballs. Then try one of the pastas with one of the sauces. You can order them all a cart.  Gives you a sample of what you're going to do when you come back the second time... and you will."}
{"text":"I would give it 10 stars of possible.  Great waitress and met Geno, ?one of the owners.. Sicilian defendants like me. Sauce with beef, pork, veal and Sicilian meatballs like one grandma's made. Cavatelli like my other grandma made. It takes A LOT to impress me with Italian food. I have never liked meatballs unless it was my grandmas',  aunts',  mom's, and mine. I REALLY liked these. I'm impressed.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My honey and I sat outside and enjoyed a late lunch on a splendid Arizona afternoon.  Great recommendations from Chris, our waiter.  Tried the Sicilian meatballs, Sunday Sugo sauce, and paccheri pasta as well as the chopped salad.  Excellent choices.  Will be back without a doubt to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food and as always wonderful service!! Thank you Antonio.
The meat and cheese board.. beware: no others will compare to this! The best I've had."}
{"text":"Every time we have been here, the food has been top notch. I love the lump crab and shrimp meatballs with Parmigiana cream sauce- it was great. I think it will go well with the vodka cream sauce nicely as well.  I wish their happy hour extended outside of the bar. But it is all day happy hour prices at the bar , so if you can find a seat at the bar then it is a good deal! We have also had the cured meat and cheese board as well as the Sicilian street board and they were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was skeptical before eating at this unusual uptown Phoenix restaurant. Now, to be fair, we went at an off-hour which meant the place wasn't busy or noisy. The negative yelps we had read all emphasized the service. We, instead, found a wonderful server, Daniel, who took great care of us. I do have to mention that I was struck that few of the waitstaff or the people we could see in the kitchen, which is open, ever seemed to smile. Although, Daniel did smile broadly when we complimented him and especially when we told him how good the food was--and it was very good. We had two different types of meatballs, the New York with a mushroom sauce and the eggplant with pesto. Now, I have to add, yes, those meatballs were made from eggplant and were phenomenal. A must have again item. The pesto was also different, at least from the pesto sauces we've had in the past. Daniel had recommended it, and we loved it. Oh, those other meatballs were also great but much more within the norm. Instead of pasta, we opted for the caesar salad option. I have to say that the salad was really good and the lettuce nice and fresh. Of course the cheese in it, as on the meatballs, was good quality. My once caveat, the absence of anchovies. Next time, we'll ask them to add some. 

Usually, we avoid desserts, but we cheated and shared a panna cotta, which was more than acceptable, and my espresso was just the right level of bitter to go with the sweet dessert. 

We will certainly be returning and asking for Daniel if possible. However, I think we will try to do off-hours, at least until some other really good restaurants open nearby to drain some of the many discerning diners this place deserves."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour spot, but you have to get in relatively early to sit at the bar. Friendly staff and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian restaurant in town! I've been here twice and already knew it was my new favorite restaurant after just one visit. The atmosphere is great! Great music and vibe. The menu is insane. From the bruschetta boards to the crafts meatballs, everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food but SO busy! Went in last night after waiting a few months for the new restaurant buzz to wear off... it certainly wasn't long enough because there was a 25 min wait, 20 min wait to get a water, 30 min wait for main course and 20+ min wait for the server to pick up our check to process our card so they'll at we could LEAVE!!! Idk if they need to hire more staff or what... but honestly the food was THAT good that it almost canceled out our anger for the LOOOONNNNGGGG wait times. Got the bruschetta and tried a few meatballs and pasta it was ALL phenomenal!!! Definitely want to go back! And Gino was WONDERFUL!! He was super friendly, made perfect suggestions and knew a lot about the menu!!!"}
{"text":"OMG YESSS! I started at the top of the menu and have worked my way down. There are only a few combos left for me to explore. The stuffed gnocchi should not be missed. All sauces are wildly delicious, especially the brown truffle gravy!! Their meatballs are perfect- the charcuterie boards are insane, too! My new favorite place!! Yay Meatballs!"}
{"text":"First time here and I really dig the concept and the menu. Upon walking in, the outdoor patio looks super nice.. turf, heaters, and overhangs. Inside is even better, with trendy decor and nice tables and seating. 

Our waitress was super friendly and helped us navigate the menu and made suggestions. We started with some wine from the owning family's vineyard (at least that's is the story we got) and it was delicious. 

We skipped appetizers even though I saw a lot of selections on the menu that I will be coming back to try, as well as any of the charcuterie board options and got straight into the meatballs. 

The way their menu is set up, you pick which kind of meatballs you want, which kind of sauce, and then which kind of pasta (or a Caesar salad) you want. There are two price brackets depending on what you pick, both under $20 so it's definitely reasonable. 

I went with the Uncle Arthur meatballs which were beef and lamb with garlic and provolone, the Amatriciana sauce and good old spaghetti. It was amazing..and I am honestly not a huge fan of spaghetti and meatballs. I do want to return to try their mushroom/truffle sauce and other types of meatballs and pasta as I had a hard time deciding what to get. Others in my group got the steak meatballs with the same sauce, which were also delicious. 

I will say, that a lot of restaurants tend to serve pasta more on the over cooked side, and this restaurant does not. Your spaghetti may be a little firmer than you are used to, but it's intentional. Our table had a discussion about it, so if you like really soft spaghetti, just a heads up. 

We finished our meal with the cheesecake and, wow, it was soooooo good. Honestly probably some of the best cheesecake I have ever had, so that's saying something. 

I think the only comment anywhere near negative was just the fact that while our waitress was great, we did have to wait a bit for our food and our check. The place was pretty packed for a Thursday night though and it's still new so that's all forgivable in my eyes. I will absolutely be returning and I highly recommend this place to Italian food lovers."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere in an area that needed something exciting.  The Tomasos Sicilian Meatballs lived up to their name! The vodka cream sauce was delightful!! Bianco Negroni was an amazing cocktail. Great for a first visit! Will definitely be back for great service from Ahmad, he was courteous, attentive and knowledgeable.  The manager Angelo was also attentive and informative. Overall a great meal."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to The Sicilian Butcher and we loved it! We hosted a big family dinner and everything was wonderful!! The food was amazing and the atmosphere was fun!!  The meatballs are out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome environment . We love trying out new things . This is not a cookie cutter restaurant!  You can taste the love in every bite ! Well be back"}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice surprise.  I took my date to this establishment and found the food to be exceptional. My friend suggested we try the food here. The service was excellent and the prices reasonable. This is a high end fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent meat balls. 
High quality pasta. 

This place has a nice selection of bruschetta and meat appetizers.

You basically pick your meat balls, pasta, and sauce. The combinations are fantastic! My wife and I have tried most meat balls on the menu, you can't go wrong with any of them. Potions are healthy, you could probably share if you want."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant last night for the first time.  What a treat. It's new and vibrant and alive. The menu features a unique concept for meatballs. You select from many different types of meatballs, add a sauce, and choose a pasta. I chose Sicilian meatballs with a Sugo sauce over creamy polenta. It was excellent! They also feature cheese and meat boards, including a 5 foot long board. It was really a fun dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here for first time with my daughter and wife. To my surprise, it's pretty kid friendly (and dog friendly). James was our server and I could tell he's seasoned in the food industry and really knows his stuff! Overall, outstanding service, great food and ambiance!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot! Hubby and I decided to venture into new territory for date night...great service and great food! Our server was great and so knowledgeable."}
{"text":"First off let me welcome Sicilian Butcher to Phoenix. You are so well needed. I am from the East Coast so I know good Italian food.  Every review was spot on.   We had Sam as our waiter. Whatever he suggested for my first visit I took his suggestion. The flavors just exploded together. 
Sam was on top of his game.  Very attentive.  The host has a great eye. He noticed that we did not have silverware for our dessert.  I love the vibe, you can feel the energy.  We sat right across from the kitchen. We got to see the hustle and bustle production that was going on. The bonus was we got to see all the food going to different tables. 
That will forever be our table.  I need to get the number.  I must have SAM every visit. 
Everyone was so nice. Starting with the man who was sweeping the parking lot!!! 
The host said goodnight he also said 
\"We Appreciate you\"  who makes you feel like that anymore?  I am all about the service!!!  Feeling important. Is what makes me tick. The food could suck but if the service is flawless I am totally fine. 


I did stop at a table full of distinguished gentleman to take a photo of one of their superb boards.  One happened to be the owner Joe.
Amazing Man.  I respect his Love for the restaurant business. 
We will be back!!!!

{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Great service. The owner Gino Came out and introduced himself, very good food and drink for a fair price!"}
{"text":"I love this place! As a person who is a big fan of meatballs, this was amazing! They have so many different italian things to choose from. I love that you can create your own pasta dish. You pick the kind of meatball you want (steak, lamb, turkey, combination of meats etc), the sauce (different red sauces, pesto, white sauces etc) and then what you want with it (kind of pasta, gnocchi, bread, polenta etc). The flavors are well developed and what I imagine a true italian meal to be like. I love this place and plan to make it one of my go-to places."}
{"text":"I have been twice. The ambiance is great. The food is pretty good but is very expensive for pasta. There is no lunch menu. So spaghetti and meatballs will run you $18. Pretty pricey for a strip mall restaurant. The hostess always acts like they are so packed and stressed when you come in (even if there is hardly anyone there)."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed our meal and our treatment by the owners of the business. Definitely encourage people to tr this place."}
{"text":"I've dined here twice now and the food is always perfect. I've tried the steak meatballs and the eggplant balls. Although I tend to go for vegetarian options, I'd choose meatballs over eggplant. I get to try the sauce of my choice each visit along with my fiancé's. All of the sauces have been wonderful. I also like that their noodle options are a little unique compared to the standards. Wine list is Italian to match which I also enjoy. They are always busy and our service has never suffered. Great energy and vibe. Can't wait to go back again. I hope they open a location in central Phoenix. Pictured is their steak meatballs, pesto, fettuccine."}
{"text":"The Boy and I have been waiting to try The Sicilian Butcher since we saw them building the restaurant and will be back on a weekly basis for sure.

We came on Friday, January 12th around 7 and there was a 45 min wait.  Wanting pasta and loving home made pasta, I was willing to wait.  We ended up hanging out by the bar to have a couple of drinks while we waited.

The bar staff was AMAZING!  Event though they were slammed and every bar seat was full, one of the gentlemen bartenders came out from around the bar to the outdoor area of the bar to get our drink orders and even offered us a taste of their Pinot Noir as a thank you for being so patient. I ordered the Ciao Bella and The Boy had The Italiano.  Both drinks were ah-may-zing but The Italiano was art.  The glass is smoked before the cocktail is poured in giving it this smokey, caramel notes on top of the other flavors. 

We got lucky and two seats at the bar cleared so we extended our stay at the bar and had the other gentleman bartender, Cody helping us.  He was just as awesome as the other gentleman bartender and was very personable.  

We decided to try the meatballs myself with Tomaso's and The Boy got Uncle Arthur's.  I chose spaghetti for my pasta and the Truffle Mushroom sauce.  Both were very good but I didn't get much of a truffle taste from the sauce.  If you like mushrooms I would recommend this sauce as it was more mushroom heavy than truffle.  Both meatballs were very good but I preferred the texture of the Tomaso's balls to Uncle Arthur's.
.
The Boy chose the Arrabiatta sauce with pasta al forno (baked pasta).  We joked that the anelletti pasta was like adult Spaghetti O's. I had a bite and it was awesome as well but a little too spicy for me.  The Boy cleaned his plate.

For our two pasta dishes and drinks, we made it out of there (with a doggy bag) for under $60.  The quality of the food, home made pasta, craft drinks, and the awesome service at the bar makes this place meatball heaven.

The only misstep I saw was with the hostess and seating.  With a 45 min wait, I said I was ok with the first available table inside or outside.  While with our drinks on the patio, there was always 2-3, four top tables empty and waiting to be seated.  I am not sure if the kitchen couldn't keep up or if the hostess thought it was too chilly to seat those tables but we came prepared with our winter jackets and would have taken the table if offered.  Every empty table is missed revenue when you are on a wait.

Did I mention there is all day every day happy hour in the bar?  Like I said before, this place maybe a weekly stop for us going forward."}
{"text":"I'm so sad I wanted to love this place !!!! We came here tonight for the second time for an early dinner and enjoy some Happy Hour. My girlfriend & I ordered a  mozzarella board , meatballs , and eggplant Parmesan app. The eggplant was Very delicious and our mozzarella board came out with hair on it gross and our server saw me pulling it out of the food and was very apologetic and said he would get  a replacement out well about 20 min later it finally showed up very fresh mozzarella and tomatoes although the bread was burnt and not very appetizing we were still hungry and had to flag down the bartender and ask if we could order more food. So we went ahead and place an order for the bucket of meatballs and they were very gross !!!! I asked for a little extra marina sauce so we could choke down a meatball needless to say we each ate one and just took them home for my friends husband since we couldn't them. We waited and waited and just felt like for sitting right there  at the bar the service was sub par he could see our drinks were empty and had our card out and had to ask for the tab which is crazy because there's always people waiting to be seated esp in bar because that's the only place you can get happy hour prices ?  To our surprise they charge $5 for extra sauce would have been nice to be told about this ? Especially after hair was in our food and took forever to bring out a replacement they should have given a discount for the bad experience with hair in the food. Needless to say we will not be returning we will continue to go to Postinos better food and happy hour anyway. Our first experience here was much better so maybe just a bad night?  The positives here are this location was walking distance to my home and is a beautiful place with a great patio and the eggplant was very good !!! As well as the bruschetta which we had our first time there so would recommend ordering that."}
{"text":"This food was AMAZING. The meatballs are on point. The service was friendly, quick and so personable. We walked in at 5:00 on a Tuesday and there was no wait. It was very clean and the decor is super cute and clean. This is a high end restaurant. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yeah.... this place. Awful. I can see why they have high reviews as a general rule; management will contact those who leave negative reviews, as happened with mine when I first reviewed this horrendous restaurant a couple months ago, and offer a gift card to make up for how terrible this place is. I removed my initial review because the gesture was gracious and of course the contact was friendly & polite, but a couple more tries here and... well, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me multiple times, and I'm an idiot. 

We have given this place multiple tries. The food is awful, the service is even worse. None of the staff knows the menu, they're consistently out of EVERY beer on their menu, and everything takes forever to actually come from the kitchen to the table.... that is, if your server remembers to ring your food in. That seems to be a recurring issue. 

Seriously. Save your money. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sicilian Butcher, a little taste of Sicily on the corner of Tatum and Greenway near Walgreens. The patio is simple and inviting featuring a cozy fireplace, while the inside dining space is surrounded by white brick walls and the Sicilian Butcher Emblem immediately catches your eye and gives the space an edgy feel. The first time I dined at Sicilian Butcher, I was excited about the possibility of having a new food choice in the area. I have to say that my first glance at the menu was a bit disappointing. The main dinner menu is essentially a \"Build Your Own Pasta\" and the meat cuts they are famous for are just different types of Meatballs. I was saddened by the choices as I don't love to eat a ton of flour and carbohydrates. We settled on sharing a salad and dinner entree. Our salad was called the Frase and I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was! It had large parmesan slices, fresh veggies and a perfect amount of vinaigrette. Our dinner entree was the Spaghetti and Meatballs. You could taste the quality of the homemade noodles, the sauce was rich and the meatballs were moist and tasty. I wanted to try a few more items on the menu before writing this review and I was especially interested in their Happy Hour. So I paid Sicilian Butcher another visit. The bar happened to be packed, which meant we wouldn't be able to take advantage of Happy Hour because it is limited to the bar only. The manager kindly extended the happy hour prices to us, as we were there to write a review. This was truly going above and beyond for us and I am so happy they did, because their Happy Hour menu is incredible. After bouncing between a couple options, we decided on the Cazzilli, Mozzarella Caprese Board, a Sausage Meatball and the vegetarian Meatball, which was Eggplant Parmesan. We dived into the Cazzilli first which consisted of potato, mozzarella and pancetta mixed together and then fried with a side of tomato herb sauce. It had a perfectly crunchy exterior with a rich and soft interior. Moving onto the Mozzarella Caprese Board, this was by far my favorite and for $9, you can't beat it. The crunchy grilled bread was the perfect pairing to the hefty slices of fresh mozzarella and especially the star of the show, the Buratta, which is fresh Italian Buffalo Milk Cheese made from Mozzarella and cream. We finished with our meatballs and crazy enough, we were wowed by the Eggplant Parmesan Ball. It was easy to tell that it's made with fresh eggplant and is baked which makes all the difference. It was so wonderful that it truly left little to say about the Sausage Meatball. The Sausage Meatball was also good but I didn't find it extra special. Overall, the quality of food is top notch. It is easy to tell that they only use the best and freshest ingredients in their offerings. The staff has been great with both visits and have gone above and beyond. I was extremely happy with Happy Hour menu and would highly recommend you give Sicilian Butcher a try and grab a seat at the bar when you can! The ambiance paired with the food is sure to leave you with something to remember.

{"text":"This new to the neighborhood Resturant is excellent ! We love the meatballs and the atmosphere too! We also like the manager always friendly and checking in with great accent ."}
{"text":"Met some friends for happy hour. Heard a lot about this place and being an old fashioned Italian, I had to try there meatballs and wow! They were so delicious.
Service was excellent and prices were very good. We were inside being high 90's and after stepping outside it was not bad with the misters. So if it hot and a long wait don't hesitate to sit outside."}
{"text":"I'm here right now. I'm northern Italian. Despite how painful it is to admit, this place is REAL good. Great concept. Great patio. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Delicious bruschetta and charcuterie boards. Perfect spot for meeting friends for happy hour after work."}
{"text":"I had one of my best dining experiences ever at Sicilian Butcher during the holidays!  I had a ball of fun with the luscious Meatballs and Polenta, Cazzilli and Bruschetta.  We paired these yummy dishes with a delicious bottle of wine for a bargain!  I loved the meatballs-tender, flavor filled and accompanied with the creamy polenta-a must have on everyone's list.  We ended the evening with the hot and cool Affogato and scrumptious Pana Cotta.  To top it all off, we had over the top service from Yolanda and a follow up from the Manager Adrian!  Key people-or as I fondly remember them- \"Yo Adrian!\""}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just tried this place a few weekends ago and we were blown away! Such a cute and trendy spot, we really enjoyed the atmosphere and the concept of the restaurant! Got a bottle of the house pino noir which was great then started with a meat and cheese board which we loved and completed the meal with two different types of meatballs! I just love the concept of being a meatball bar! Super simple and super unique. Everything was very reasonably priced too as we paid less for our meal than many expensive restaurants and had a far superior time and enjoyed our food so much. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"We visited a second time, with a group, and everyone was raving.  We did the bruschetta platter, the mozzarella platter, the hummus platter and then all did our own meatball dishes.  Everything was top notch and amazing!  The service was incredible, too, everyone is so friendly and helpful.  We have recommended this place to many people and they have had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, fresh pasta, attentive service. Everyone enjoyed their entree. The crab seafood meatballs with the cheese cream sauce was outstanding. We'll  be back. Worth the wait"}
{"text":"This place is always packed, so we had to check it out to see what the hype was about. 

I was a bit saddened to find that my beloved Modern Grove was gone, so I was certain that something superior would have taken it's place. FYI - if you have never been to a Modern Grove, be sure to \"treat yo'self\".

We arrived for my wife's birthday, not really knowing what this place was about. Got seated fairly quickly during a busy time. The place is beautiful and the seating is great in the winter months outdoors. 

We were seated and it took a good 5 minutes for our waitress to come greet us. We ordered water and beers, I swear I am not exaggerating, but it took around 10 minutes to get our drinks; I am weird and I time this stuff, as if waitresses and waiters don't have to deal with enough from customers. Sorry. By this time, my daughters have completely devoured all the bread sticks provided and are getting ravenous. The waitress was very absent throughout the entire night, it was very disappointing. I digress, I will get back. So she brings our beers, she says they are out of the beer that my wife ordered, so she took the liberty of getting her a different one, without even asking her or telling us they were out. I mean, thanks...? But at about $9 a beer, she would have liked to have been the one to chose. 

We look at the menu, order an ap and some entrees at the recommendation of the waitress and with a spin of our own preference. The food came out fast. I just wasn't happy with the meal, it was so... boring. The ap was great, a little charcuterie board of sorts, very tasty. But the entrees are just noodles and meatballs, totally taken aback by this. I know I sound like a nut, because I ordered the food. Perhaps it just wasn't for us, or I ordered the wrong thing; I am not sure. But this is the large majority of the menu, like that's their thing, balls of meat. There just isn't much to say, the dish was OK. Bland meatballs tossed in some sauce with noodles. If I can be completely honest, it tasted just like my mom's Hamburger Helper beef stroganoff that she used to make growing up, so the feels are there. I am not trying to bash \"The Butcher\", I think that it's just not for everyone. Unless they have something on the menu that would completely change my mind, I don't think that I would be back anytime soon. Possibly next winter to drink at the bar... that sounds nice! Also the waitress was very absent, we spent a lot of time waiting. Waiting for water, for the check, for the box. I think she may have been overworked as she seemed very experienced and was pleasant."}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch and dinner. Service has been great. Excellent meat balls and pasta. Both times had the Tomaso's Sicilian Meatballs with the vodka sauce and different types of pasta. Large portion and excellent  taste.  Friend had the ceasar salad bottom instead of pasta. Was a large salad with meatballs in a separate bowl with a unique pesto sauce. Great vibe and open welcome feeling."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of appetizers and bruschetta boards!!! The wine selection is simple and delicious not to mention their bottle prices are reasonable!! The set up of the menu selections are very creative and fun because you can design your dinner based on your mood and appetite level. The bartender staff is super creative and helpful if you want advice on what you'd like. Desserts you've got to try the affogatto. If you want an experience you can create like the butcher creates cuts of meat....give The Sicilian Butcher a try."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and the parents were in town with their dog. Called around finding places that had dog-friendly patios and then stumbled upon this gem- and so happy we did! Spacious outdoor seating with cooling misters and comfortable turf-like flooring for the pup. The food was excellent too. We started with the bruschetta board- highly recommend (the fig one was our fave)! For our main course, most of us had their salads (large portions and tasty) while one had their turkey meatballs and pasta. You could tell immediately that pasta is made in-house and that comes across in flavor too. Everything tasted fresh and the service was great. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. They use authentic Sicilian ingredients like my nonna used to. Great music anc a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Excellent pasta, excellent sauce. The environment was great. The management was friendly and conversational.  Being from NYC my Italian friends would be impressed!"}
{"text":"Holy F#@king S#*t, this place is GREAT. Wait, that doesn't really cover it. It is truly the best Italian food in AZ by a TON! The rice balls were ridiculous. I wanted to fill a bathtub with their marinara sauce and rub it all over my body it was so good. The cured board appetizer was really good and had a LOT of de-shelled pistachio nuts on it. And the meatballs were so fresh, tender and tasty, I'd say they are the best I've ever had and at the risk of sounding like a pompous ass, I've been to the best Italian restaurants in the world. I didn't take a picture of those though because I couldn't wait to try them!

But wait, there's more, the dessert was awesome! The cheesecake and deconstructed cannoli are a must if you do dessert!

Our server (really the bar) was a little slow on the drinks but they were really busy and that is to be expected sometimes.

The GM and another senior staff member (I think he is a higher up manager) checked on us twice and I noticed the higher up guy, I believe his name was Jeff, was even bussing tables and at one point, got us our drinks and cleared our plates . In any event, I was very impressed with him and the whole experience. 

I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants great Italian food!"}
{"text":"Just dined at the Sicilian Butcher for the fifth time. Yes, it can be crowded , however, that is a good thing because the food is very good, reasonably priced and the staff is excellent. For a real treat, get there early and dine at the bar for happy hour. Possibly the best overall deal in town. They specialize in meatballs and they are excellent. The decor is also very pleasing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, we went on a Thursday night about 7 p.m. and there was a waiting list!  Loved the décor!  Hostess was very nice.  There was a slight hiccup about seating-the waiter for the section was a bit backed up so they held up seating us for about 10 minutes so he could catch up.  He was very good and helpful.

While the rest of the family was able to enjoy a variety of the famous meatballs and pastas/sauces-I had the roasted beet, goat cheese and fig salad.  I wanted to try a meatball, but I have a dairy allergy and not one of their 8 kinds (including the vegetarian) was made dairy-free!

We also shared the Pane Cunzatu bruschetta board.  It's obviously a popular place and the food is good.  Because of the high ceilings, it is a bit noisy making it hard to actually carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Strangest experience ever....4 of us go here for dinner....little pricey but it has food I like...so realistically 4 of us will spend 150 or so.....the menus talks about the happy hour.....when we ask we are told you can only get happy hour prices if you sit at the bar (which was full) the tabletops near the bar (which were full) or at the bar outside (it was over 100 degrees)
We were all older folks so we asked the \"manager Josh\" if he can make an exception given there weren't any seats in the happy hour area....we were told no because then he would have to make an exception for everyone (false).....so we go outside only to find there are only 2 wines and 3 or 4 beers available anyway for happy hour ....why wouldnt a manager mention this is beyond me.....so about 7 feet behind their bar are 7-8 tables covered with umbrellas all empty...so we bring our drinks there only to find out if we do that we aren't allowed to walk 7 feet back to the bar to take advantage of happy hour pricing..... at this point we all decided that we would spend our 150-200 on dinner somewhere where customers aren't shuttled like cattle.....now another \"manager\" Gino comes over to explain with some bizarre logic that they use happy hour to attract customers (??) and couldn\"t let people coming in for dinner enjoy it as well.
I will never ever go here again and share this experience with as many folks as I can. Clearly the 150-200 my party was going to spend was irrelevant .............so if you want a 5 dollar glass of wine and want to sit at a bar for hours and watch sports YOU are their preferred client......if you want to have dinner don't expect anything less than to be treated with disdain.............found another place close by and enjoyed dinner.

My thought ( as a retired business owner) had \"manager\"Josh simply said something like , \"the happy hour only includes these 2 wines ,I'll let you have 1 at happy hour prices ..enjoy your meal\"  that would have been fine....He was quite arrogant and condescending....."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.

I met a friend there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and was looking forward to trying this place out, because I know how great Tomaso's is. This is an offshoot of the Tomaso's group, and their first foray into the more casual atmosphere, focusing on their famous Meatballs, with an emphasis on the Charcuterie. Everyone who really knows me, knows that I'm a huge fan of a Charcuterie board, and that I always try to influence our group to spring for one if it's an option. We were sat by the delightful Olivia, at a table near the back - just like I prefer. A good start.  
What I enjoyed about SB was the feeling of the extension of the kitchen, all the way out to the front curb. It gave a feeling of an Italian-American family experience, complete with Grandma's marinara sauce simmering on the stovetop all day long, and even reminiscent of that scene from Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" when Ray Liota is ducking the Police Helicopters long enough to still stir the sauce with a big wooden spoon. 
I was fortunate enough to have Kendra as my server, and she was both thorough in explaining the menu, as well as insightful in providing some detail in what goes on behind the scenes. We discussed how crazy it is to have the Octopus, and indulged me by intentionally taking a route by my seat to let me see the entree as she delivered it to another table. The menu had staples like the fantastic meatballs, but was adventurous enough to include things like the octopus as well, and didn't seem cluttered or confusing. Gino, the manager, made it a point to come over and rap with me, and had the table belly-laughing and entertained. Next time I head in, I'm going to bring about three other friends, and we're going to try the Pane Cunzatu - a sicilian-style bruschetta board that looks like an experience on it's own. 
I made a mental note that this would be a great spot to meet clients for a business lunch, and intend to in the near future."}
{"text":"Was a super fan of this place! Wish I lived closer! 
The owner came over to introduce himself and ask about our day and if we had been here before. After saying no it was our first time he quickly explained the ins/outs of the restaurant and how things were prepared, called our waiter over and introduce us to him. Very classy. 

Our waiter was on point and offer suggestions and identified items we saw on other tables. 

Food was great, drinks were great! This place is great!! 

What more can I say... GREAT! 

I was impressed. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The atmosphere was fun but intimate. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"From one of the most creative yet well-grounded range of Italian dishes to superb service,  this is one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.  The bruschetta board is a highlight that you should include.  I just love this place.  If you check out some of my reviews of other places, this is reserved for the very few."}
{"text":"I had been really excited to try this place out, watching it as it was built out down the street from me. It's in a great location, very well decorated, with plenty of parking.

I came here for lunch mid-week and it wasn't busy at all (though that may have changed now that it's been open longer). Our server was super nice, explained the menu to us, then gave us our space, as it was clear we were meeting for business.

The food came out quickly and was simply delicious. I ordered one of the meatballs with spaghetti and meat sauce. For me, it was the perfect amount of food with great flavor. I can't want to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Sicilian Butcher has lot of potential. Given they are new, they have few things to work out.

The best part of this restaurant was their appetizers. Came out hot and was absolutely delicious. The meatballs were also delicious. They were juicy and very flavorful. We tried their shrimp/crab and NY meatballs and it's difficult to decide which are better. 

The pastas were little disappointing especially so because they make them from scratch. We had the ribbon pasta and linguine. They were over cooked and clumpy. It was difficult to separate the linguine so we had to cut them like tofu. 

Their panini was interesting. It's not meant to be eaten with your hands because there is no way you can lift it and take a bite without making a huge mess. It was filled with almost 2 cups of ricotta cheese (I'm not kidding! see photo). Not much taste to it either. I'd recommend pass on this one. 

Our waiter was friendly and attentive however he failed to notice 3 empty glasses of water half way through our meal. 

They definitely have few things to work out. I will update my review when I get a chance to give them another try."}
{"text":"Wowza! Came here around 5 and the place was packed! Never have I seen the parking lot filled as well as cars constantly coming in and out. We were quickly seated despite how busy this place was already. The drinks were reasonably priced and had a good kick. Appetizers came and were devoured instantly. We got the Cazzilli and Crispy Cuttlefish. Kiddos approved. Ok...now I'm getting excited that this place might actually be good!! For entrees we got the bambinos Grilled Cheese Panini and Rigatoni and Cream while the adults decided on a Brushetta board. We got everything but the Rigatoni- we got the Meatball dish instead. All good in the hood. Understandable that there will always be a few kinks in opening nights. Each dish was edible and will definitely be back. The staff were quick, engaging, and responsive. Hopeful that this place will do well as we are in need of something with an umph around us!! PS...don't be alarmed to see familiar faces from Hash Kitchen!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Asked for recommendations from our server and the manager, Luigi.  We had the bruschetta board, eggplant parmigiana appetizer and Sicilian meatballs with pesto on gnocchi.  Everything tasted great!   Would definitely come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Beautiful food and great service..amazing polenta chips and gnocchi was out of this world fresh and home made. Great outdoor patio and ambience..we will be back..try it..you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Our visit was fantastic! Igor, our waiter, was attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered Charcuterie board, a mix of Italian cheeses, meats, nuts. pickled veggies, jam and baguette. Their cocktail is sublime, with twists on favorites like a Mule made with Peach and Campari. The main menu has you selecting a type of meatball, then a sauce, then a pasta (Or polenta, or bread, or salad). My hubby had polenta, I had fluffy stuffed gnocchi, both with Parmesan cream sauce, and their signature meatball made with Beef and lamb, dense with flavor, NY style, like I grew up with! On to dessert which was a de-constructed Cannoli. This was a bowl of cannoli cream, with mini chocolate chips, and Pizzelles and a bowl of Maraschino cherries (the FRESH ones!). Thanks, Gino, for suggesting it! All in all, this place is our new Italian!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We had a charcuterie board and the Uncle Arthur's meatballs and they were both amazing.  So many tasty choices on the menu.  We will definitely add The Sicilian Butcher to our list of go to spots!"}
{"text":"Stopped by right after they opened today and loved it. Courtney was our server at the bar and she was wonderful.  We got individual meatballs to try (on our way to another party). They weren't on the HH menu but ask what they can do.  The seating at the bar was backed up to the tables behind us.  Very tight but the customers seem to all know each other so lots of hugging and greetings. Very New York Italian.  Loved it. The eggplant meatball was delish!  Great for vegetarians, and many more meatball choices we'll want to try.  All the servers were helpful and professional, but Courtney went out of her way to be sure we were happy."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional. The service unfortunately wasn't up to speed.  We were there on a busy night one month after opening. There seemed to be confusion in the front of the house. Once we were seated we waited 20 minutes and those around us who came in after us had already had their drinks and given orders. We asked 2 waiters if someone even had our table with no avail (high top by the bar) and then a fantastic very busy waitress jumped in and said she'd be happy to take us on, afterwards gave great attention.  10 minutes later another waiter came up and asked \"oh I see someone else already got you wine\". Clearly in no hurry. Yep, he was supposed to be our waiter.  I'd like to chalk it up to new wait staff getting up to speed but I don't know.    Good prices, excellent appetizers, nice entrees.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Vaction....Very popular restaurant. Make reservations.  Nice outdoor seating and heaters provided. Our meals were so good. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. Our waiter offer us some suggestions that turned out great. We ordered cured meat and cheese board, flora salad, toys dry aged steak balls w pesto trap sauce. The board was very tasty mix of meats and cheese. My wife finished most of it. I did enjoy the salad it was fresh and I could taste all the veggies. The meatballs won hands down. Freakn so good. The bucket of meatballs were 5 big ol meatballs. So so good.  I hated to leave one behind but I was stuffed!"}
{"text":"I am in meatball heaven! My new favorite place. We felt extremely welcomed and the food was amazeballs. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see this place reopened and really enjoyed our visit.  We sat outside under the canopy with heater and it was very pleasant.  The lighting and ambiance was lovely.

Our server was great, friendly and attentive. As a vegetarian I had the eggplant meatballs with Marinara. They were delicious but a little cold in the middle. I asked for them to be warmed and came back still cold. Still very delicious but would be a hundred times better if heated correctly. Hubs had some dry aged steak meat balls which he raved over.  We both had the Caesar Salad, which was excellent, one of the best. 

I will definitely go back and give it a hearty recommendation to others to try."}
{"text":"The reviews are not exaggerated! This place is amazing. The dishes taste slow-cooked with love! My husband had the sausage meatballs with saffron rissotto and truffle mushroom sauce - a perfect pairing! Meatballs were tender & just a bit spicy, the risotto was rich & satisfying, and the truffle sauce elevated the entire dish! I had Tomaso's meatballs over the ricotta & spinach gnocchi with vodka cream sauce. Every bite was just decadent yumminess! Friendly service. Upscale neighborhood vibe. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So many things on the menu are delicious and I am still working my way through it. High points so far:  Tomaso's Sicilian Meatballs, Uncle Arthur's N.Y. Meatballs, Lamb Meatballs, Creamy Polenta, Saffron Risotto, Stuffed Gnocchi, Carbonara, Arrabiatta, and  Vodka Cream Sauce. The décor is cute, funky and casual, the ambiance is upbeat and fun, the staff is lively and knowledgeable. It's a new favorite and I intend on being a very regular customer."}
{"text":"Loved the food, our waiter and Gino the manager.  He found my Oakley sunglasses, put them in a protective case and called me to let me know they had them.   Love the honesty and customer care!!!"}
{"text":"The Sicilian Butcher

The main entree centers around their specialty meatballs and bruschetta boards.

Choose your Meatballs, Sauce and Pasta.

I ended up selecting the following - Tomaso's Sicilian Meatballs in the Sunday Sugo Sauce on Paccheri Pasta

The Tomaso's Sicilian Meatballs consist of ground veal + prime beef + pork + pine nuts + raisins + pecorino cheese + garlic + fresh herbs

Sunday Sugo sauce consist of the following - veal + beef + pork + mirapoix

Paccheri
Large tube pasta

Pasta are served in bowls which don't look to big, but are good size portions

Also had the Charcuterie Board which included 4 toppings which were 
1)dill mascarpone + smoked salmon + crispy capers + lemon
2)smoked blue cheese aioli + tomato + arugula + bresaola
ricotta + prosciutto + honey + hazelnut
3)tomato + basil + garlic + e.v.o.o.
4)ricotta + prosciutto + honey + hazelnut

The meatballs are very good, breaks apart very easily, nice tasting and good consistency.

Very modern decor with a butcher theme including a display of buther knives hanging from the ceiling."}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere, very, very busy on weekends and they don't take reservations so be aware that you will wait. Service was excellent, music was maybe a little too loud although we were seated right under a speaker. Food was delicious although was disappointed when I ordered the arugula and prosciutto flatbread and it came with lettuce instead of arugula. When I pointed it out they were apologetic and said they had run out of arugula and they comped it immediately so a good outcome. Drinks were delicious and the bartenders, though incredibly busy, were smiling and having fun. Great addition to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I might be biased because my family is Sicilian, but it is no stretch to say that this was the best all-together meal I have had in two years at a restaurant. The chopped salad was fantastic, my Korean wife has always hated salami, but she gobbled up all of her pieces very quickly. The meatballs are the main event and they are juicy, airy, but at the same time \"not-about-to-fall-apart.\" The pasta was al dente, nuff said. I tried the vodka cream sauce and found it perfectly adequate. The deconstructed cannoli was amazing, the cherries in the filling were soaked in something that was incredibly yummy. The atmosphere is fun and classy, but not overly loud or gaudy. 

The owner spends time interacting with the patrons and we never had a complaint with the servers.  The food comes pretty fast and they made no mistakes. 

Keep in mind that between 6-7pm there can be a 30-40 minute wait as this place is popular. You might want to come like we did around 730, we walked right into a table.

Loved it so much, I'm taking my Sicilian mom there this Thursday for a real treat."}
{"text":"What a wonderful concept. It's as easy as: 

1. Choose your Meatball
2. Choose your Sauce
3. Choose your Bottom

With quite a few options to choose from, there's a twist for everyone. I ordered the UNCLE ARTHUR'S N.Y. MEATBALLS (ground Lamb/Beef) with ARRABIATTA sauce and Fettuccine pasta. It did NOT disappoint. The flavors were well balanced and the meat, unlike other establishments did not have a very bold taste. Will definitely be back."}
