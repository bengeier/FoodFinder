{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have not eaten here. My review is purely based on my inability to reach anyone to place a delivery order. 

Based on the wonderful reviews and a friends recommendation, I was so excited to try King Wong and loved the idea that they deliver! I tried for TWO hours to reach someone to place an order. After many attempts, unanswered calls, and busy signals....I gave up and moved on.  It is unlikely that I would try again. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Holy hell. This place is the truth. I hope you're hungry. Cheap. Amazing. Nice people. I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Super dry . Blah. Chicken was a funny color. Tastes like Chinese from a Buffett.
Delivery guy left our food outside of the hotel room????"}
{"text":"Cheap but delicious great service we actually left our iPhone in the restraunt and the server ran out to the car and returned it. Huge portions too! And supper fast"}
{"text":"Big portions, friendly staff, and they always give you something complimentary with each order (egg rolls, crab puffs, drinks). What's not to like? Not to mention their service is fast and always fresh. This is my go-to spot for Chinese food in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Two stars is a little bit of a stretch but it wasn't all horrible. We ordered online and paid online, which may have been a mistake... it said 45mins to an hour. We waited almost an hour and a half for subpar food.

I called after an hour had past and gave them my address, then there was some yelling in the background and the lady got back on the phone and barked at me that the driver was on the way. Now this place is maybe 10mins away in traffic, it took another 20 mins to get to me. 

Now, of you recall, I had paid online. Well, when the driver finally arrived  (whom I might add, looked like he hadn't showered in a week) he asked for the payment. When I told him I paid on like he gave me attitude and didn't believe me until after I should him the confirmation email and didn't apologize for the delay or mix up. 

The egg rolls and pot stickers were soggy, like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. The beef and vegetables were ok, and the sweet and sour pork was meh. 

All in all, don't waste your time and go to sui wok instead"}
{"text":"UGH!  It appears as though we've lost another place that WAS great.  King Wong WAS our go to for great chinese food, but no more.  We had become regulars, eating there at least 1-2 per week.  When the food was terrible the first time, we chalked it up to a bad day, and didn't think about it.  Everyone has a bad day right? So then we ordered again, and it was worse than the last time.  WTH??  Did they fire their cook? Not wanting to believe our fave little Chinese dive could possibly have gone down the tubes, we gave them one last shot. Mistake. It was even worse than the last two times. Don't bother eating here.  Easier to just dump some oil on old food in the back of your fridge and call it a day."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat Chinese food because it's usually oily or makes me feel a little sick, but this place didn't!

My mom and I were driving through Phoenix and found this place on Yelp. Decided to go from looking at the reviews and we were welcomed with great customer service, and delicious food. You can't beat the lunch prices. And the shrimps were large! Will definitely return whenever I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't know if the food is good or not. The lady who works the register is so hard to understand it is virtually impossible to ask a question. I have Acute diverticulitis so I am unable to eat anything with seeds or peanuts in it. After asking her several times if the dish I ordered had any kind of seeds at all to witch I was assured it didn't . I get home only to find it is covered in seeds. So in the garbage it went. I don't like wasting money so I'll not be going to this place again."}
{"text":"This is our go-to take out Chinese place. They are super fast and have all the standard menu items. Their prices are cheap and still the food is good! 

If you are looking for something other than a chain and just a simple take-out/delivery give King Wong a try."}
{"text":"It's a good Chinese food joint. Great big portions and super friendly staff! Their wonton soup is amazing, probably the best I've ever had!!!  If you are in the area and need some quick tasty food, stop by."}
{"text":"We moved from New York and discovered the Chinese food here was terrible, most places my wife and I ate at was so bad we couldn't even eat it. We had asked locals where to find good Chinese food  and we guessed that they probably didn't know better, the food was horrible !! So we asked a local where we can find a lousy Chinese food place, someone said go to king Wongs we laughed and said its probably very good, the food was excellent the best Chinese food around the valley!. Close to back east style cooking. Only thing they didn't have was spare ribs, now we need to find good pizza lol and good Italian food! We found good Italian ices and the place was empty, the locals had a line at the shaved ice stand,go figure. King Wongs is excellent !."}
{"text":"Just got off the phone with Herman he is great! Took a great amount of time making sure everything in my order was correct. This will be my first time ordering but by other reviews the food seems to be wonderful. Looking forward to tasting being new to the area! I have learned though, where there is excellent CUSTOMER SERVICE other important aspects are to follow!!"}
{"text":"I am from New Jersey and New York area pretty good Chinese food on the East Coast this is one of the best Chinese food I've had here in Arizona"}
{"text":"The service is excellent and fast. They are so welcoming and homie. I love this place! The food is fresh and tasty. You can tell the quality of the food. The servings are,also, huge enough for two people or a lot of leftovers. And I got free egg rolls. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. We had it delivered. They picked up the phone immediately. They were very helpful. We got 6 crab Rangoon for free. Eat here!"}
{"text":"the food is good the price is better not my first choice it's  between 4-8 but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wouldn't order from here again. Took forever for deliver its only ten min down the rd from my house it took 50 min. On a Sunday night at 8 o clock. The general chicken is soggy... If that's even possible (the sauce didn't have that good spicy tangy flavor I think it was old) the fried rice that came with it was dry and tasted like paper. The crab puff is literally only cream cheese and the chicken skewers are so over fried I couldn't even eat (chew) them. I also order veggie spring roll the \"veggies\" inside where all brown idk if it was because they were bad or it was an over use of soy sauce. They had no duck sauce but a sweet and sour sauce that  mostly tasted of vinegar to me. The people on the phone were nice but the order seemed to be really hard for them to take. The person who was on the phone with me had a hard time talking to whoever was there and asked about some of the food we were ordering. Like I said I  would never ever order from here again I would eat mcdonalds before I had to eat this."}
{"text":"Will never eat here again. Staff argued with me about our order, they sent the wrong food. I have never had such bad customer service! WOW... The crab puffs dont have crab in them. the cheese wontons are all pork. I dont eat pork. The fried rice was mushy and gross.  Who argues with a customer when they mess up their order. $28 of crap food."}
{"text":"We also got a menu left on our door and decided to try this place out last Friday night when we were in the mood for chinese take out and a movie. We haven't been able to find any good chinese food restaurants nearby us, but looks like we found our go to place now!

As everyone seems to have experienced, fast delivery, big portions, great food, etc! If I had to complain about something, I would say the fried rice is different and not my fave, but considering how great the lo mein, general tso's chicken, egg rolls and crab puffs were, that's fine with me.

We will definitely be ordering from here next time we're in the mood for takeout. If you're wondering if you should try it, the answer is yes!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, BBQ Pork Fried rice, and 2 egg rolls.  The Teriyaki chicken was dry and had very little taste.  They included a  TINY plastic  cup of sweet and sour sauce with my order.   It was literately the size of a thimble!   Oh and how hard is it for the driver to make sure he has a pen in the car at all times???

It looks like this place just had a change of management or at least changed their name cause i found negative reviews for this  same address under another name.  Guess they kept the same cooks...

I will not be ordering from there again..."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've found since moving here. Their fried rice is more than just white rice with soy sauce. They actually fry it up to perfection. Their orange chicken is delicious! A little bready so it's hard to reheat, but I usually don't have leftovers anyway. Their garlic chicken and garlic shrimp is great, too! They throw in free food all the time and are so quick with delivery! Their minimum is $15 for delivery, but don't charge a delivery fee. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for some good, quick Chinese food without spending a ton!"}
{"text":"Great staff, service and price. The egg rolls were so so and the shrimp with garlic sauce ok. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff and amazing food at great price. The schezwan beef was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, small confusion over my address but easily resolved. Fast delivery, accurate and good portions - plus they gave me a couple extra eggrolls! I ordered lunch specials and appreciated the fried rice with the entrees. Excellent value - and very tasty."}
{"text":"Returned to my hotel room after a long day and didn't feel like getting out.  Ordered delivery from King Wong after reading generally good reviews here on Yelp.  I was not disappointed!
 
First, their online menu is clear and easily understood.  I also like the inclusion of business hours and a list of credit cards accepted.
 
Delivery was quick with the food arriving in half the time quoted by the person who took my order over the phone.  Everything was packaged neatly, and I'm especially thankful for the plates, forks, and napkins that were included.  It's a huge help for folks in a hotel room.  Also included were soy sauce, sweet/sour sauce, and fortune cookies,
 
All of the food was piping hot, and portion sizes were quite generous.  I started out with an egg roll which was delicious.  Two egg rolls constitute an order, and they gave me twice that many.  A nice surprise.  I'll save the others for later.
 
Next it was time for chicken and vegetables.  Again, wonderful.  There was chicken, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, bamboo chutes, water chestnuts, cabbage, celery, and (I believe) cucumbers.  The chicken was in bite-size pieces, and the veggie were sliced appropriately.  There's enough food here to feed three people.  Enough white rice (packaged separately) was included to complements the meal.
 
I got full before I reached the chicken fried rice.  It looks and smells good, however, so I'm putting that and the 3 leftover egg rolls in the fridge here in the room.
 
The prices are very reasonable considering what you get.  I paid $18.79 and received 4 egg rolls, chicken with veggies & white rice, chicken fried rice, a Coke, and a bottle of water (thrown in).  Plus all of the condiments and other goodies mentioned above.  There was enough food for three, possibly four people.  I'm sad my wife and daughter were not here to share it with me."}
{"text":"I like the variety. The gentleman who took my order was very pleasant and helpful and the food came promptly.  I'll be order from there again soon!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food we have tried in Phoenix, as of yet! We ordered the fried shrimp, potstickers, fried chicken wings, egg drop soup, shrimp fried rice, and kung pao chicken. Everything was delicious, but the potstickers and dipping sauce were amazing! They also threw in some free egg rolls and crispy wontons! The service was great, really treated us like family. I'm not kidding when I say that the owner gave me a hug on the way out :) We would definitely go back again. The outside doesn't say too much, but those are usually the best. I highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"This place is great for a filling, inexpensive, good meal with friendly service. Two people can eat dinner for less than $20 and have enough left over for two more meals. Everyone who works there is super nice. Don't expect it to be authentic and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good!! The service was more than excellent, and the servings were huge. And if that wasn't enough for just paying 6 dollars they gave me extra soup, and extra rice!! I have enough for 3 meals!! When I'm in the area I will visit this place again!!"}
{"text":"I realize this place is take out, but I chose to dine in one evening.

The first thing that caught my eye when I walked into King Wong was how hard working the manager was.  And I suspect it motivates the rest of the staff, who were timely and attentive, as well.

Next, I noticed the heaping portions, and my delicious twice cooked pork was no exception, out maybe five minutes after my order was taken.  

King Wong is not a gourmet restaurant.  It's quite simply the best take out I've had in Phoenix, a city which seems to struggle to provide good Chinese food.  So fire up that Netflix and order yourself a hefty dish of delish from King Wong!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience with this company. They were very pleasant on the phone and even gave us free egg rolls for Valentine's Day. Great food, Great customer service, Great date night. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I got delivery from here three times. All times the food was delivered in a timely manner! and everything I requested was brought. you can request chopsticks and I suggest asking for extra sweet and sour sauce. I'm not sure if they have their own mustard i just received the package one. I never dined in yet.
         Their beef chow mein is really good. and the hot and sour soup is good. the kung pow chicken is a little bit too much peanut for me. the eggrolls are good not a soggy one yet! my boyfriend orderd the orange spicy chicken and that was the first to go from our plates!!"}
{"text":"This place is really excellent. I have tried many Chinese food  places n AZ and hands-down the food is great here. Everyone is alway so nice and ready to serve. I can't recall a wrong order. My favorites are the Mongolian Beef and Seasme Chicken among other. I wanted steam vegetables and they made it for me. How cool is that. Location is a little run down but seriously sometimes the gems are hidden like that!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the, first time tonight and was amazed. I usually don't like getting Chinese food because the portions are small and it's expensive. But this place was not like that!! I spent $23.77 TOTAL on 2 dinner entrees one subsituted for fried rice, 6 crab puffs, and 4 egg rolls (2 of which they gave me for free) and it was delivery which was only $1.00 
The portions of the entrees were huge and it was actually good! 
Very happy I found this place! 
Probably will be the only place I get Chinese food from now on :) 
Def get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out I've found in Central Phoenix!

We are East coast transplants and never could find Chinese Food takeout like we had back there until King Wongs opened up!  Hits the spot we've been missing for some time.  Food is always prepared fresh and the service has always been great.  They usually throw in some extra free apps too if you order over a certain amount but totally reasonably priced.  Never ate there in person but delivery is always exceptional!"}
{"text":"The chicken fried rice was good, a little burnt but ok. The egg roll was actually delicious and enjoyed that very much. Haven't had a chance to try other plates but just a simple comment."}
{"text":"-  Very Good Food!
-  INEXPENSIVE 
-  Grade A By Health Department
-  BY FAR THE MOST ACCOMMODATING PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!

Our waitress, Maria, was EXTREMELY hospitable giving us extra rice to take home, asking if we wanted more soup, gave us 2 more egg rolls at no extra charge and we left feeling like we left a relatives home."}
{"text":"The staff at King Wing was really helpful and welcoming.  The food portions are huge and the flavors are robust. For my party of five, we ordered four entrees and it looked like we barely ate.  Our bill, including drinks (before tip) was $44.  
The restaurant itself is on the small size. The staff, food, and pricing make the trip definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times and each time it was a pleasant experience. Food is a little greasy but delicious in the best \"I'm craving carry-out late at night on a Friday Netflix binge\" sort of way. HUGE portions for cheap. The staff is really friendly and you're sure to get a laugh each time you go. It's also nice to get almond cookies/lots of fortune cookies with your food."}
{"text":"From the beautiful mural outside to the more than generous food portions, my favorite part of this small eatery was Maria!
She was so sweet and sent us off with a hug, full and smiling. The orange chicken combo platter was good and spicy but not scorching. 
I give King Wong's two thumbs up."}
{"text":"A real hole-in-the-wall with fantastic food. \"A\" Health ratings!!! Hubby and I ate in, although this would be great for take out or delivery. With all the extra free goodies (tea, egg rolls, soup, hot tea) we ate until we were stuffed and took home enough food to last both of us for 2-3 days. Hubby got the House Lo-Mein dinner combo (extra $2.00) for the shrimp and I had the Orange Chicken dinner combo. Both were outstanding, what was supposed to be hot, spicy, cruchy, etc. was exactly that. We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh food, seafood always cooked perfectly, large plump shrimp, super friendly staff."}
{"text":"First they delivered the wrong food after waiting an hour for them to deliver called them and they tried to say it was my fault I ordered something else but even if I ordered the thing they said I did it was still wrong  and they finally said they'd deliver the right food I just had to pay the difference which is no problem so I waited about 20 mins and then they called back and said they couldn't deliver the new items they were too busy and they would give me a credit and hung up on me before I could say they had charged me. I called back and said that they had already charged my card so they need to return the money because I didn't get the food I ordered. The  lady said she was to busy she'd talk to the manager and call me back and they hung up on me again I am pissed don't go to this place!"}
{"text":"Really nice people, good food, and large servings! Their delivery is awesome and they typically deliver before the estimated time"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time today and from the service to the food was amazing! The guy who took my order had an amazing personality! Ordered from the lunch special and ordered the Mongolian beef. I was shocked to see that for the lunch special comes with serve fried rice, egg roll and a crab Rangoon. I'm use to places that charge extra for fried rice, crab Rangoon and egg rolls. I also ordered a small egg flower soup. When I received my soup I was once again shocked on how big the portion servings for a small. In total my meal was less than $9!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and it's delicious. Definetily will go back. The food was so good and they give out good portions. I recommend doing take out or delivery though as the place is kind of hectic to eat at"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Had the Hot & Sour soup. Ordered a cup and our wonderful waitress served us bowls. And 2 free egg rolls. And hugs. She was so sweet. The dish we ordered was meant for one but you could have seriously fed 4. We are staying the night in a hotel so had to leave food behind. My only criticism is that the sweet and sour an the hot mustard were really really runny. Not sure if they were trying to make it go further or if this was normal. The crab puffs were awesome. In any event it was the best Chinese we had had in some time.  When time to leave we both got another hug. It was like dining in a friends home. Awesome."}
{"text":"Deserving of zero stars.

1. On delivery you forgot utensils. I just moved here and I told you I needed them. Thanks for making me drive out to get some.

2. Your mapo dofu is not spicy. It's sweet and you put all this watery vegetable nonsense in it. Like squash? Really? Why even offer the dish if you don't know how to cook it?

Seriously never ordering from you again."}
{"text":"Amazing, traditional mom and pop Chinese food! Huge servings and great value! You even get free egg rolls (just ask... on their website).

We shared orange spicy chicken, chicken fried rice, and the egg rolls. The orange chicken was not so spicy, but delicious. Fresh, white meat, flavorful, not over cooked or greasy. The chicken fried rice was also very good. Definitely leftovers... Impressed!"}
{"text":"For some this is good food, but to me and my boyfriend it is subpar to other restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just what I needed, good Chinese food. Not a chain. I had the large bowl of wonton soup which had veggies and shrimp mixed in. It was large enough for two of us to share. Then we topped with chicken with veggies and it was good. Glad we found this place in Phoenix. You know only a few hours from the Pacific Ocean. :)"}
{"text":"Prices were cheap but quality is sacrificed.  The food was just meh for me.  Portions are huge though so for a cheap and filling meal, go for it!"}
{"text":"Place is legit. I got the kung pao chicken dinner combination--it was super tasty, freshly cooked, and an insane amount of food for less than $10.

Gotta admit there was a moment of concern when I pulled up, but dozens of yelp reviews can't be wrong, can they? Once inside it was like a cliché of an awesome family-owned hole-in-the-wall-type place. I left a tip and the adorable lady (wo)manning the register gave me three extra fortune cookies (in addition to the one in my bag) and tried to get me to take a soda too. I want her to be my grandma.

If you live near here and you go to panda express, it's only because you're a terrible person!"}
{"text":"Just had King Wong for the first time today based on highest rated chinese spots in my new area.  I have to say the service and portions are fab, esp. for the pricepoint, however, when I arrived home, I saw that the wrong lunch combo had been placed, so I received the no. 2 (spicy orange chicken) vs. the no.25 (wong's spicy chicken).  Not a big deal as the no. 2 is nicely spiced and it is tasty, just not what I ordered or had my mouth geared up for.  Nevertheless, I would give them another try as they do have good service, prices, they deliver to my spot and their menu is solid."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Food is great! Service is even better.. Given tons of free stuff just for making a big order!! Unbelievable! Order order order!!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Order from here every other Friday to get my families Chinese fix on. They are always quick, affordable and super-polite and courteous. Can't remember a time I ever had a bad experience here! 

If you want to clear your sinuses - ask for the homemade hot mustard!"}
{"text":"Take-out experience was amazing! I was honestly skeptical about getting food from here due to location, but I was defiantly wrong. We ordered the pot stickers, crab puffs, chicken lo-mein, orange chicken and lemon chicken. A little feast to feed a big family but it was just 2 eating. We devoured the whole meal!! Everything was beyond amazing and delicious. The owner even through in 2 free egg rolls. Personally didn't like the taste but my picky adorable bf loved them. I will for sure order from here again. Friendly and very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Cheap food personally I think the egg rolls are the best around the staff is super friendly and I can't complain you can order anything with white meat and the menu is huge"}
{"text":"Everyone was extremely nice and courteous, but I didn't like the food. The hot and sour soup tasted like plain boiled pork, and the broccoli and beef had a thick paste that didn't taste good. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The first time I stopped by because of a write up in the New Times extolling King Wong's virtues. I was coming home from visiting a friend at St. Joe's and was exhausted. The staff was helpful, friendly, and quick to take my order. I received my food after a very brief wait. My to go order was delicious and exactly as I had ordered once I got home, and they threw in free egg drop soup!

I ordered for deliver a second time, their delivery area is HUGE. Again, friendly, helpful, quick to take the order. And again, a freebie, this time egg rolls! You can tell they really care about their business."}
{"text":"Rock Stars!  At first I laughed at the Styrofoam container of sweet and sour sauce (after reading some of the comment about the 1 oz plastic of sweet and sour ....\"about the size of a thimble\")  Good job.  Customer overkill  (which doesn't happen enough when speaking of a restaurant )  But then I opened my sweet and sour pork and the sauce was not on it. The breading was still crispy and I could portion the size for myself.  And left overs (if reheated properly) would almost be as good as when they were fresh.  A few more carrots, onions and pineapples would have made this a 5 star review.

And the Kung pao veggies was a serious amount for the bargain price of  $5.50.  

Ask for the egg rolls if you spend more then $9.00 and you will find that bullet of sweet and sour sauce.  The egg rolls were good to.  Not \"spring rolls\" (which others in the area give away) but honest-to-god stack-of-half dollars size egg rolls (and if you recognize the difference you know what I'm talking about).  

Ten minutes and it was waiting for me to pick up."}
{"text":"Such amazing food for a great price, always beyond happy with my order. They always value their customers and are super friendly."}
{"text":"Food was a bit pricey.  Shrimp Lomein was dark colored and thinned tasteless noddles.  They didn't deliver something as simple as duck sauce!  And the wonton soup was horrible!  Wontons were kinda like dumplings, except they don't serve dumplings.  And the texture of the \"wonton's dough\" was thin, and tasted nothing like a decent soup....  Anyways; the eggroll was really good!  I think they gave us a 3rd one for free, and it had me craving for more!  

But unfortunately, I doubt we will order again from them."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Incredibly affordable, large portions, delicious, and the staff makes you feel like family. They almost always through in free extras like free wontons for the wonton soup, an extra egg roll, or whatever else they have. I love that you get a free crab puff, egg roll, fried rice, and barbeque chicken as an ADDITION to your dinner or lunch entrée (because I'm a glutton like that). Everything I've had here is pretty good. I really liked the orange chicken, the egg rolls, the wonton soup, chow mein, beef and broccoli, and the vegetable delight. 

I've ordered take-out twice and went to pick up once. Although this spot isn't much for ambiance, the inside is still clean and respectable. It's definitely a good place to check out if you're wanting tremendous amounts of Chinese food for a very low price!"}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by how ghetto this place looks, the food is bomb.com. The owner is excessively friendly and they hook it up with huge portions and free extras. 10/10"}
{"text":"There is zero atmosphere, so I would stick with delivery or take-out. The outside looks a bit sketch and the inside leaves much to be desired, BUT....the food is delicious!!! The prices are VERY reasonable and the portions are gigantic. This hole in the wall is well worth a visit. The service was great and the lady, Maria was kind and helpful."}
{"text":"We dined in. Got a couple dinner combos, and I got a small soup. The woman who served us said that for Chinese New Year she would give my bf a soup too and we'd also get a couple free egg rolls. Since the dinner combo came with egg rolls I wasn't sure if we'd get those. Sure enough when out plates came we got and extra egg roll! Can't argue with that!

The food was pretty tasty, service was very attentive. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is now my favorite Chinese joint in Phoenix. You walk in and the first thought is \"oh no. This is not a restaurant. This is a room with chairs and tables.\"
But then you order. And the magic begins.
Great sized portions for the lunch menu. Free egg roll, cream cheese wanton, and fried rice with every lunch special. The egg roll is wonderful. A few of those alone and you have a meal. The entrees are huge portions with as much white rice as you can eat. Twice Cooked Crispy Pork=amazing. General Tso's Chicken=awesome. Complimentary Egg drop soup=hearty. I bought 2 lunch specials, 1 entree, and 2 sodas and it was less than $23. I will be back there often."}
{"text":"This place was unexpectedly good. Place is quite frankly a hole in the wall in an area that is much of the same. I was in town on business and was in the mood for chinese. The food came out very hot and fresh and was delicious. A/C seemed to be out which is brutal in Phoenix during the summer. The friendly staff set up a fan for me which made it tolerable. Dinner combination came with noodles or fried rice, egg roll and some teriyaki chicken, as well as your chosen entree. The spicey orange chicken was fantastic! I had to deduct a star because ambience and NO a/c definitely takes something away from the experience."}
{"text":"This place was rather smaller than I expected but the familial atmosphere and the friendly service was amazing!
The food was delicious, my friends and I shared several dishes (I especially loved the Sesame Chicken) like is traditional.
I didn't like the fact that we had to ask for chopsticks but I concede that generally non-Asian looking groups of people don't normally eat with chopsticks.

All in all, food - delicious, service - amazing, returning? - definitely!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but we have stopped purchasing take-out from here. I know that correlation does not equal causation, but it seemed that around the time we would order from King Wong, my husband would get a new debit card in the mail because there was fraudulent activity on the card. Since we haven't gone here, this hasn't happened anymore. Just wanted to give a heads up to any customers. Love the food, but use cash or dine in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This will be my new go to Chinese take-out place.

Walking inside the restaurant I observed all of their \"A\" ratings from previous health inspections.  I was greeted by a very nice, older, Asian woman.  I placed my order and I didn't have to wait very long, as my food was ready.

The restaurant does have seating for in dining, but in my opinion this is more of a take out type of place.

The food was excellent and their portions are huge.  I will for sure be returning or calling in an order for delivery next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite all right for fast food Chinese. The food is good, though not something to write home about, and the portions are generous. Service is very friendly and the restaurant itself is more spacious than it would seem from outside. I do like the old-school Chinese restaurant serving dishes - it shows that the place has been here forever and has enough staying power because of a satisfied customer base."}
{"text":"Fresh made food. Great prices, big servings. Fun to meet, great service, makes you feel at home. Just eat here and you will be happy."}
{"text":"The portions were large and the food is tastey enough. But the place is grimmey and disgusting. I was quoted a time of 10 minutes and waited for 30 minutes inside the restaurant for my take-out order. The man who was helping people seemed like he didnt know what was going on and his huge hairy gut was hanging out of the bottom of his tshirt the whole time. It almost made me lose my appetite. It was very unappealing. Tuck your shirt in, guy! If you are ordering from here, get delivery so you dont need to step foot in here. And allow some extra time..."}
{"text":"Free egg rolls and crappuffs.  We always drive 15miles to get here.   We will never go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Let me tell you of my journey.. I've been on the search for a Chinese restaurant for years.. I found one once... Too expensive. One time I found another.. It was too fancy and I couldn't just go there and pickup. But King Wongs is different... It's the one. It's sooo GOOD! It's One that's made by people who are actually Chinese and know how to make it right. One that has pickup. One that has fresh food always. One that I can go to whenever I'm hungry because it's just that easy. And THAT one place is here people. Everything on the menu is delicious! Maria and all the workers are great and amazing. Once you start coming here, you won't stop. Trust me. I'm a regular and I love it every time! I've never had something bad to say about this place. Once you start going there the more the workers will remember you and the more welcome you'll feel! This place is great to go whenever you're in the mood for some yummy Chinese food or you could even just take it home and watch some Netflix with your cat or your lover."}
{"text":"I have to add an extra star. It would be pretty silly for me to keep returning over and over to what I referred to as \"mediocre staples\". I am comfortable with it, though. I have since tweaked what I order to come with white rice which is rather good and now that they give you a fortune cookie with the check instead of the almond cookie, I am now walking away much happier. I can finally recommend this great little restaurant."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT Chinese food and great service. If you love good Chinese food then check this place out!"}
{"text":"Having a farewell lunch for a coworker and we decided to try this place even though it is a bit far from where we work.  It was a real hole in the wall but that never deterred us before, sometimes you find some real gems.  The staff was very friendly and attentive which is always a big plus.

Now the menu is cheap so right off the bat I didn't have my expectations very high.  When I go to a questionable Chinese place for the 1st time I usually get teriyaki chicken to be safe.  When my chicken arrived it looked strange.  The chicken was cooked fine but the sauce was very light, like an amber color.  When I tasted it I discovered that they had either used a really cheap sauce or ran out and used maple syrup because it seriously tasted like Log Cabin on my chicken.  Also the fried rice tasted a tad burned and was very dry.

Since the meal was so cheap and since the staff was so nice we just laughed about it and honestly It wasn't the end of the world.  Will not return since China Chili is closer and much better."}
{"text":"Nice people, good food, inexpensive neighborhood joint.  They have a thriving delivery business.  Super yummy fresh egg rolls."}
{"text":"I think I had kum pow chicken but I could be Wong. The experience was great,the food was amazing! This little gem of a shop is the closest thing I have tried to actual Chinese food since I was in the military. This place is authentic as they come! I will drive out of my way just to eat here 90% of the time. I have had three fortune cookies come true the next day after eating here! This is proof the Chinese are a good luck charm. It's great to see foreigners thriving here in our culture feeding us there art! This is a very clean and well maintained facility. I will be returning and I will highly recommend this to friends and family! Thank you so much!

Additional Tip: The egg rolls are spectacular,try them"}
{"text":"Mostly a take out and pick up place-no ambiance to speak of. Plenty of food, though I found my moo shu shrimp very salty.  Beef and broccoli was good."}
{"text":"Average food. Crappy delivery time... 1 hour and 15 minutes. Not good -.- seems to be the standard around here. If your hungry from a hangover, order from here it's also good for bigger parties. Yum vodka and take out mix very well"}
{"text":"If you don't care about the awful food quality, bland overly sweet and poorly prepared very NON AUTHENTIC Chinese food and a dirty interior, perhaps you'll enjoy the friendly, fast service, cheap prices and entree/combo portions which could feed 2 or 3 average size adults.

The other reviews giving this place high praise for \"tasty\" and \"authentic\" Chinese are suspect -  e.g. I too was once a young, naive, poor college student who hadn't a clue what delicious real good inexpensive Chinese food can be. 

2 of us ordered General Tso's Chicken and Schezuan Beef combo dinners which came with fried rice, bbq chicken, eggroll, crab puff and egg flower soup. I specifically asked the server if the Sesame Beef was lightly crispy on the outside (which it authentically should be) She said, \"Yes!\" . It wasn't. It was actually served with the meat battered in an awful tasting bad-tempura-like puffy coating as was to our horror the General Tso's Chicken!! Flavorless, eggroll pastry was terrible, the crab puffs pastry and filling was sub par. The egg flower soup was ok as was the fried rice, but just ok.

 I've had far better inexpensive diner style delicious Chinese  in San Diego,Ca  &  Boise, Id - this place sucks - run away."}
{"text":"I keep trying to force myself to like chinese food and I just don't, so I won't hold that against King Wong. I had a little bit of the beef and broccoli and the spicy sweet and sour chicken. They were both okay, I liked the chicken better then the beef. So much food for the money, that was a plus."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in phoenix. Clean I say clean and the portions are worth every penny. It reminds you of Chicago and new York Chinese food. It is great food and I would charge more if I was the owner. Don't judge a book by its cover this place makes a 5 start snottsdale Chinese restaurant look"}
{"text":"I was really scared..  But turns out they're a very decent Chinese place!  The rice is a bit overcooked, but the actual food is good.  And gotta love their prices.  This is now my go to for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised affordable delicious reminds me of the Chinese spots back home in New York. Must go!!"}
{"text":"These are the best egg rolls I have had in a very long time. Sam is great and he demands the best from his restaurant and I can tell u I'm going back. Thanks Sam I know you won't ever let me down."}
{"text":"Great quality food with family focused welcome! Take out scene is insane, the phone never stops ringing. Owner is kind and so hospitable. We try something different every time and flavor is uncompromisingly spot on. Non-greasy and a good balance of serving. We found our favorite and affordable Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"King Wongs is my delivery chinese go-to. Sam is always on time with my order (yes, we are on a first name basis) and the food is always great. They always throw in free egg rolls or crab puffs which is of course awesome. Oh and the portions are huge, always eating on it for like 3 days. Never been to the actual place, but def recommend for delivery."}
{"text":"First review, I just had to.  I have to admit...My girlfriend and I have stopped by this small restaurant more than a few times this month after a long days work.  The owner must be starting to think we're a little crazy.  Each time we arrive we're greeted like family and our order is taken promptly.  It takes about 5-10 minutes before our food is ready to go...and while we wait, we've always been treated to a free drink and some almond cookies.  Gotta try anything on the menu with breaded chicken (aka. wong's chicken, lemon chicken, sweet and sour, etc), it's extremely tasty.  I haven't eaten better Chinese food since I lived in NY.  I've waited 4 years since moving here to find this place...with a lot of disappointment elsewhere.  I always appreciate restaurants who hang up recent inspection grades.  A's and B's fine by me.  I just hope that the food, service, and family atmosphere remain the same until I leave this city."}
{"text":"There are several Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood and this is far and away my favorite. Great food with great flavor at a great price. No one I have sent there has been disappointed."}
{"text":"Got delivery just now, seemed like good people. Super fast but I'm not far from them. Food was good, and order was complete even got extra egg drop soup for free...I will be buying again!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out sesame chicken lunch special. Egg roll was decent, rice tasted mushy and the sesame chicken sauce tasted like maple syrup. The workers were super nice but I personally will not be going back."}
{"text":"The sevice goes above and beyond. The food was good and plentiful. The location is a little sketchy and the decor is simple. The Service, The food and the Portions of food more than make up for the location."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly! They deliver which is great since 32 St is always busy. I love their soft noodle with shrimp. The portions of the dishes are a good amount compared to other take out! Overall great food"}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese take out spot. We've actually never been to the physical location but the delivery has always hit the spot. They offer free wontons or egg rolls it seems almost every time and the house fried rice and orange chicken always hit the spot. I wouldn't call it gourmet by any means but if you want standard Americanized-Chinese food, this gets it done."}
{"text":"I made an order with them on Yelp the other day, based on the reviews I was excited to try this place because there's a lot of really bad Chinese food around Arcadia so I was hoping to find a good spot.

The food was okay, honestly this review isn't about the food I received. 

Their delivery option had a six pack of 12 oz drinks or a 2-liter option, I chose Pepsi. The delivery guy comes and hands me a 12 pack box with six drinks, of ginger ale and grape soda. Not Canada Dry or Fanta, some cheap store bought stuff that sells the entire case of 12 for a dollar. I paid 4 (due to convenience) bucks expecting a 6 pack of Pepsi. The delivery guy looks at me and says \"well I don't know what you want me to do\". Dope man.

If you didn't have what I requested you could've called me to verify if I wanted something wildly different. Absolutely awful customer service."}
{"text":"Everything a neighborhood Chinese takeout/delivery restaurant should be: 1. Great food 2. Inexpensive  3.  Everything ready in 20 minutes and 4. Absolutely zero atmosphere/pretension. So unless you love dives like I do, I wouldn't recommend dining in."}
{"text":"Our party had twice cooked crispy pork, orange spicy chicken, beef n garlic sauce and the teriyaki chicken. The first 3 were amazing. Seriously they were money well spent. Eggrolls were THE BOMB. All of the staff were genuinely nice. But the teriyaki chicken was awful. Sauce was like water eith no flavor and the chicken was rubbery like boiled chicken. Sweet n sour sauce for eggrolls was watered down too. Would have given 5 stars otherwise and will go back again soon."}
{"text":"Well I must say the lady who took my order was super sweet and helpful being it was the first time I visited this restaurant I ordered the orange chicken not spicy it was pretty good I had ordered the lo mein noodles with that they were all right My husband had ordered the  teriyaki chicken and fried rice teriyaki chicken had no flavor it tasted like old chicken fried rice was so dry I was disappointed since I was looking for a good Chinese place to go !! I would recommend this place if you're ordering orange chicken sweet-and-sour chicken"}
{"text":"Decided to check King Wong out after they were listed by MSN as the best Chinese food in Arizona and I also saw so many reviews, the majority good, on Yelp.   I always take reviews (good and bad) with a grain of salt, so it was a \"we'll try it and see\" decision for myself and my husband especially considering we've been in Phoenix for 6 years and haven't found a place we like.

The moment we walked in my husband and I were greeted, shown a place to sit and from that point forward we had the best customer service and awesome food.  The sesame chicken was so good, not over or under cooked with just the right amount of sauce.  My husband had teriyaki chicken, something I am generally not a fan of but I tried it and really enjoyed it.  It tasted amazing as well and the chicken was cooked great.  I love egg rolls but I'm really picky about them.  It seems I'm usually getting ones that are over cooked or so limp they're falling apart, these were perfect.  

As noted in other reviews it is small but I've been to larger places and felt like I wasted my time and my money.  I also loved the fact that while we were there more than one customer came in and chatted with the staff like old friends.  Obviously this business knows what they are doing with their service and their food."}
{"text":"I don't like Chinese food but I LOVE this place! King Wong has the yummiest, homemade and authentic Chinese food. Everything from their crab puffs, soups to main dishes are divine. The employees and are so sweet and kind which just adds to the experience. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is suuuuper divvy, BUT I ordered the beef fried rice on my way to work and it surpassed my expectations.  I love beef fried rice and it's probably the best I've had so far it PHX.  Is it the best?  No, but for $7.95 you get a load of it and it's really good beef.  I wasn't disappointed.  I had a cold so the soup was for medicinal purposes."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong and tried to argue about it. Their lunch plates are a joke looking at the proportion of rice to entree and the fried rice was extra dry hard over seasoned rice."}
{"text":"If you live near Central Phoenix or Biltmore, no Chinese place beats King Wong on value.  Great portion for excellent price.  To top it off, the interior of the restaurant is like you've just stepped into modern China!  What else can you ask for?

Here are some signs that you've walked into a LEGIT pick up Chinese food:
1) 80 year old Grandma is working the front, and confidently speaks zero English.  Check.
2) Refrigerator is stocked with 1.5L soda bottles.  Check.
3) Cleaning supplies and stacks of to-go containers. Check.
4) Manually hand written receipts. Check.
5) Restaurant seats 3 people.  Check.
6) SUPER FAST, well portioned CHEAP Chinese food!! CHECK.

We even ate here the night after my wedding a few months ago.  I served this to my own relatives.  That's some major vetting right there."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed.  A little bit of a hassle since you have to call (no online ordering) but the food is good and they always have freebies or specials.  Plus the delivery is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We did a big takeout order here and the food was hot, ready, and packaged well upon arrival. The portions are generous and they even threw in extra crab puffs which was nice. Super tasty also. The staff is friendly. Would highly recommend! Next time we'll try delivery."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and let me tell you i will definitely be coming back. The food is great, not too pricey and the waiting time wasn't long at all . I ordered the teriyaki chicken it was very tasty and they give you a big portion wasn't able to finish it all, they also gave us egg rolls at no extra charge . The customer service there is absolutely great! Every one working here was very attentive to us and very friendly. Maria is just too sweet. We will be back and will be bringing our whole family next time."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I have had in my 25 years of living. The 1 star is for the nice lady at the register."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Chinese Restaurant. Great service, the quality of the food is amazing and they throw in extra food complimentary on the house every time I come here especially if you stay and eat in."}
{"text":"Excellent place for authentic Chinese food! They have amazing combo deals! Friendly upbeat invirment and the egg rolls are splendid!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the owner were great.  I had the fried rice and ku pow chicken the flavors were on point."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. I'm vegetarian and Sam guided me through my options flawlessly. I wish I'd gotten my delivery guy's name, food was searing hot and perfect! Definitely going to be a frequent repeat customer. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"These people take care of you. I have never left here without them going above and beyond. Whether it's throwing in a free appetizer or soda, or making sure you have water for your ride home, when you come here you are family. And this is just their customer service!

Their food is always great! We usually get a few enteees and a side of lo mein. No matter what enteee we get it has been great. The batter on the orange chicken is perfect. The vegetables are always fresh! 

My 6 year old daughter requests to come here weekly!"}
{"text":"The food was disgusting. The chicken was rubbery, the sauce was completely bland, and it made me sick. Took like 2-3 bites and I had enough. Both my girlfriend and I ordered different items and they were both nasty. Waste of $30 just to give us stomach problems."}
{"text":"I haven't even tried the food yet... However, I placed my order over an hour and a half ago and still NO food. I was told over the phone it would be an hour. I provided my phone number, apparently it didn't occur to anyone to call and give me an update if they got busy. I had to call them! I had to call about 20 or so times before anyone answered the phone and I called BOTH numbers listed. Then they put me on hold and told me it would be another 10 or so minutes. Ugh!! At this point they don't deserve any stars. I'm on a business trip and it's been a long day, I was really looking forward to my wonton soup. :("}
{"text":"Wow. To have the delivery guy complain about the tip and wouldn't leave the door to an elderly woman. Never ordering again from there."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on recommendations from Yelp. We tried several different dishes and all of them we terrific. The helpings were HUGE and we had plenty to eat. I am only sorry we don't live here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ordered. Paid. Didn't ever get the food. Restaurant argued but I'm sitting here with a hungry kid wondering how they're telling me I'm wrong. You should note what customer service really is. Customer pays, customer should get what they paid for! Ridiculous. I ordered through the yelp/grub hub app and they never helped only told me to keep calling the restaurant. Wouldn't order from here or off there, you won't get your food or money back. Scam."}
{"text":"great food at a great price.. i have no complaints about service or food.. i always come down to get my food.. i love the people who serve and help me there.. enjoy the hot and spicy food.. and always get some free egg rolls.. the coupon is on the take out menu.. i frequent a least once a week."}
{"text":"King Wong WAS my favorite Chinese restaurant, ever. After eating here at least 5 times, I'm sad about the food I had delivered tonight. 

Let's start with the good: 
-Huge portion sizes
-Cheap
-Friendly service 
-They give out coupons for free food 
-Arrived very quickly

Okay, the bad:
-Bland. The food is usually great quality and tasty. Not today. 
-The veggies were cut really bad and unevenly sized. Like some of them were huge and others were barely there. So they weren't all cooked the same. (some huge carrots, some noodle like carrots)
-Pork & Vegetables... where's the pork?
-Egg Rolls... Tasted unlike any egg roll I've ever had, can't put my finger on what was wrong.
-Crab Puffs... this was the most disappointing part... There was NO crab!! The menu says CRAB PUFFS. They've always put crab in them until tonight. Just cream cheese. 

Definitely disappointed in King Wong. Looks like I have to find a new favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great all around Chinese delivery - staff is always super friendly and accommodating.  I normally stick with Moo Shu, which I personally think they do a great job making, but once when I wanted to order beef with snow peas, I asked \"what exactly is in it?\" before ordering.  The response was \"beef, snow peas!\" (Duh!)  Well, I ordered it.  Once I opened up the container there it was... beef and snow peas... and a damned boatload of the usual, awful 'canned' bunch of tiny corn, bamboo shoots, carrots, some onion and of all things, green pepper.  So a word to the wise:  BE SPECIFIC AND INSIST ON WHAT YOU WANT!

The only suggestion I have for King Wongs, is for them to be REALLY daring, and start keeping Duck Sauce around for those great egg rolls they serve!  

You must be buying that sweet and sour sauce BS by the 55-gallon drum, and it's the worst stuff you can use to ruin a decent egg roll!

Back to the first sentence of my review - it's why they're my go-to Chinese delivery!"}
{"text":"Good Asian food and the staff is super awesome too. They are also very generous with their food portions and tossing in little extra things for free."}
{"text":"Comfort food in a small clean restaurant in a strip mall. We are in town to get a quick start to a vacation and the motel receptionist  Marissa I think recommended King Wong. She said they have fast delivery but we decided to go out. Ordered beef w snow peas, & cashew chicken and steamed rice. The really friendly waitress offered us egg flower soup. It was yummy with crspy fried wonton strips. The food plates were huge. Nothing special but delicious portions with lots of fresh, crispy vegetables and lots of meat. Tender beef slices and large moist chicken breastfeeding meat. We were stuffed and only ate half!

Dinner for two was $16.95, you can't beat that. Give them a taste."}
{"text":"I have now ordered from this place twice. The orange chicken, vegetable chow mein, and egg rolls are excellent. My has been ordered a spicy beef dish and it was excellent as well. We will continue to order from these guys in the future."}
{"text":"So glad I tried this place! The delivery arrived about 10 minutes ahead of time, and the guy who helped us was very friendly. I had the bean curd family style and some egg rolls (they threw in 2 extra for free). The tofu was nice, and flavorful, and the vegetables were all fresh. Everything was cooked perfectly. My boyfriend got the sweet and sour pork, it looked awesome. I don't eat Chinese food anywhere but buffets and takeout places, but King Wong is a noticeable step above that. And the sauce that comes with the egg rolls is delicious!"}
{"text":"Sketchy location with absolutely no atmosphere.  We were the only ones who choose to eat In the restaurant.  They do a brisk take out business as the phone kept ringing every few minutes.  They had 3 delivery people.  
Super nice staff who offered us plenty of free things such as fried wonton skins, egg drop soup, veggie egg rolls.  We ordered the #2 Garlic Chicken and #13.  Szechuan Chicken.  The lady warned us that they were spicy and we told her medium spice.  The food came quickly.  Both dishes looked and tasted basically the same with the exception that one had cabbage in it.  The chicken was slightly over cooked and really did not taste fresh.  I really wanted to like this place based on the reviews.  
The restaurant could use a face lift.  It looked tired and old with taped up chairs.  Definitely a hole in the wall.  One of the staff discovered I spoke Cantonese and rattled on.  She hugged both of us as we left and thanked us.  Parking lot available.  Prices are cheap."}
{"text":"So far so good! Great price for the money and the food was up to standards- they use real meat!!
A must try!"}
{"text":"Shrimp lo mein, shrimp fried rice egg rolls both veggie and meat made perfectly restaurant was clean staff was polite very informative. I'll probably become a regular. Hidden Gem"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite Chinese restaurant, I found them on yelp when I moved into the area. Delivery is great, they usually throw in free soup or an egg roll. Finally got to eat inside and the vibe is great! Friendliest staff and great hospitality. I highly recommend this place to anyone, take out or delivery. Oh! And the food!!! You just have to try it"}
{"text":"I ordered teriyaki chicken and it was disgusting it was very dry. I ordered spicy and it wasn't spicy what so ever. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decided to try some Chinese food here. To play it safe I just got an order of chicken fried rice. Well the rice and flavors were good there chicken was kind of on the dry side. We also got an order of the spicy orange chicken. Orange chicken was good but far from spicy."}
{"text":"flavor wasn't the best and it took 1hr 45 min for my food to be delivered"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best, but they got so much of my order wrong its hard to believe.  I ordered beef w snow peas, house chicken extra spicy, and egg rolls w no sweet and sour sauce but extra extra hot mustard.  I got beef with vegetables that admittedly DID have a few snow peas in it, but had lots more of other soggy vegetables instead to go with the chewy beef.  The house chicken was more like a general tsao even though Id asked for a recommend for  chicken dish w a savory BROWN sauce, and it had little to no heat to it at all.  The egg rolls were fine but i got about a gallon of sns sauce and 2 measly packets of hot mustard, that barely gets me thru one egg roll.  They threw in 2 extra egg rolls, but without enough of my preferred condiment that Id specifically requested, the gesture just didnt go far enough to make up for everything else.   I I was truly optimistic about trying this place out after reading other Yelp reviews, but ended up simply disappointed overall."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of the reviews and the fact that they deliver. 
I ended up picking up and it was ready in about 12 mins.
I ordered pork fried rice, Mongolian beef and shrimp and snow peas. Got free crab puffs with my order. 
Sad to say that I wasn't impressed. There was no flavor in any of the items I ordered. 
The shrimp was clear and mushy, the vegetables were mushy as well. The rice was overcooked and the crab puffs were not only not crispy, there was no crab only cream cheese. 
I will not be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken through Postmates since I had free delivery, and frankly I just wish I hadn't spent the money. The fried rice was mediocre at best with too many green onions and too much soy sauce and the shrimp was completely tasteless and overcooked, so much so I just didn't eat it. The teriyaki sauce was passable, but the chicken was overcooked and leathery without any flavor. It also looked like I got the worst parts of the chicken when I got a gristly texture. Overall, the meal was very unappealing in both look and taste and I'm only giving it a two star because the teriyaki sauce itself was okay. tl;dr - I really don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"We just moved into our new apartment and of course needed to order delivery. We saw the ratings on here and thought we'd give them a try. So glad we did! Our food got here fast and was super hot. We got the Wong's happy family, and it lived up to its name. Lots of meat and veggies, heaping portions, and the guy who took my order even threw in some extra egg rolls! Food tastes great and the meat was super tender, even the beef, which often is too rubbery with Chinese takeout melted in our mouth! Nothing was too greasy. The delivery driver even went and got us some forks and napkins when we realized we didn't have any! I highly recommend them the next time you order Chinese."}
{"text":"Best Chinese place I've been to in Phoenix. They have great service, incredibly generous proportions, and the food is to die for."}
{"text":"It was disappointing considering the 4 star review average. 

I had the sweet and sour pork lunch combo, and a small bowl of hot and sour soup.

The soup was ok, not that savory or sour. And there was no meat and way too much egg for my taste. The fried rice was average, not especially good or bad. The egg roll was good. It was my favorite thing. It had a fresh taste with hints of ginger. 

The sweet and sour pork was not good and the main reason for the 2 star review. There was no pineapple in it and not enough green peppers or onions. The worst thing was the thick batter on the pork. So much batter it made it hard to eat. I've had worse, but I was expecting better. At best, it was average strip mall Chinese food. I've had better food from a buffet."}
{"text":"Great food, lots of it and very quickly. After traveling the whole day to get back to Arizona we tried King Wong and immediately wished they were in flagstaff.  The staff was very delightful and gave complimentary egg drop soup and more than double the size of our appetizer (crab Rangoon's).  By the time our food came there was hardly room on the table for it all. Ordering two entrees (not combos) we were able to ear more than 2 whole meals."}
{"text":"Egg flower soup was good no vegetables in it but was the best I had in phoenix pot stickers were also the best I've had in phoenix the food was pretty good I will be back again"}
{"text":"Well I was going to give them 4 stars for the food BUT they forgot my 3 egg rolls and when I called them to let them know I was given the run around about why I didn't receive them, the lady says because she didn't charge me the $2 substitute for the noodle upgrade that's why I didn't receive my eggs rolls, I didn't ask her to do that, and to top it off I tipped the driver very well! Won't be getting my business again!"}
{"text":"King Wong is the best Chinese food in AZ. On top
If that they are the nicest people I've ever dealt with at a restaurant. They are always giving free add ins like 2 liters, egg rolls, or water while you wait for you food. From the food to the service king wong is KING!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food also their portions are large and the house fried rice was great and so was the orange chicken and beef and broccoli"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time ordering from here and it was a fantastic experience. The food was delivered quickly, tasted great, and the customer service was excellent. I will definitely be ordering from here again! I recommend Spicy Wong's Chicken."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. I definitely had my doubts about this place. Location was sketchy. Aesthetics leave much to be desired. BUT, the service and quality of food were exceptional. The employees are very friendly and strive to ensure the customer is happy. My favorite dish so far has been the Mongolian beef. The pricing is very reasonable and the portions large. They also have lunch specials which are a bargain. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Very tasty consistently. Delivery driver arrived within the quoted timeframe - a pleasant surprise in the world of delivery. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We found this during a 8pm, we've been moving houses all day, new to the neighborhood, scour yelp for open restaurants rush.  This was the best find of the move...actually of a while. It's a family owned and run lil almost-dive restaurant. They seem to do most of their business via take-out and delivery, but there are a few tables to eat in. 

The food is awesome! It tastes great! This place only comes in second (in my personal experience) to a Chinese restaurant in Anchorage Alaska. We had Sesame Chicken, Lo Mein, a beef dish, and an order crab wontons (which were free with a coupon given with the menu). The portions are huge! We ate our fill and still had enough for two people to have full servings for lunch the next day. I can't recommend this enough!

We will definitely be back....and plan on working our way through the menu. :)"}
{"text":"I'm going with five because I love sweet n sour chicken. Their chicken is always crispy and stays that way because they put the sauce on the side. Other dishes are good as well and the food is always consistent. The people that run and own this place are seriously the sweetest. Delivery can take a little bit longer than my stomach would like but pick up is much faster. Overall tried multiple places in the area and I keep ordering from here."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD. Incredible prices. The friendliest service. My boyfriend and I are addicted. The Kung Pao chicken is amazing. Get the dinner combo if you dine in or delivery is fast and you can tell the food is fresh and still steaming when you open it. Highly highly recommend. 10 stars if I could!!!!"}
{"text":"When I see reviewers giving this place an aggregate 4 stars I am reminded of why Yelp is somewhat unreliable.  I mean no disrespect to anyone but this place is no where near worthy of that rating.

I live in the area and I have eaten there on purpose twice, and have had friends and neighbors feed me their food a couple more times.  At BEST, I would say the portions are generous for the price.  If that is all that is required to get 4 stars, then so be it! 

This food is not good, and that's being kind.

Greasy, gloppy, gristly and nearly all the sauces taste alike.  There's basically three tastes here: salty, sugary salty and savory salty.  Most dishes fit in there somewhere.

I'm a supporter of family-run places, but I can't support this one!

One star for generous portions of basically sub-par food. If that's your gig, I think you'll like King Wong."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The food is your standard, run of the mill Americanized Chinese fare. Nothing incredibly special here. They serve decent portions for a great price (see the lunch specials). They even deliver! A really solid choice when you're feeling Chinese takeout. 

Note: Wong's Chicken is equivalent to General Tso's Chicken. I found this place because I wanted to find some really awesome General Tso's Chicken after watching the \"Search for General Tso\" documentary on Netflix. Highly recommended for anyone interested in food history."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday night. So this review is based on a dining experience rather than take-out or delivery. As others have said this is a total hole in the wall restaurant. Dining is simplistic, just basic tables and chairs, with a fan blowing in the room to save on air conditioning.

Food was great. I ordered the Thai style chicken curry. It was delicious and smelled better, but I'll admit it was very spicy, a bit too spicy, and they didn't ask how spicy I wanted it, so if you get this entree maybe ask for mild spicy, maybe they'll tone it down a bit. I also ordered crab cakes, not realizing there were 6 in the one order, nor did I realize or anticipate that they'd add a free eggroll and soup with my entree. The dine-in enree was very generous. So I had a bit too much food.

Also, dining in among few strangers there I felt that the staff were extremely conscientious and concerned for my well-being, almost irritatingly so, but I appreciate that they really just wanted to do me good and serve me well. The gentleman (owner??) who assisted the waitress is on the large side (no offense, sir) and as such his presence and moments of interaction were a bit imposing.

Pros: 
Great food!  Delicious. Food is why we come!
Huge quantity.
Very nice and accommodating service.

Opportunities to improve: 
Dining environment nothing much to look at.
Spicy entree too spicy, should ask for spicy level preference.
Slightly too much food. (er, not sure if that's still a pro or not...)
Slightly overbearing (but very kind and courteous) attention.
Waitress accent slightly difficult to understand.

I will be back."}
{"text":"It was alright.   Dirty inside.... Cheap.   6.45 for rice, egg roll,  cream cheese thing,  chicken and vegetable.   I probably won't be going back there though."}
{"text":"Still searching for just decent Chinese food in the Valley. 

This isn't it. 

First off, I like a dive place as much as the next person. But this place should be condemned. Filthy, dilapidated, just plain gross. 

Now, let's get to the food. Meh. Very large portions. No substance. Ordered egg rolls, Mongolian beef (way too spicy), cashew chicken and chicken egg foo young. 

Mongolian beef is mostly onions and green onions. 

Cashew chicken was white meat chicken, but had no taste and like someone just tore the chicken apart. No continuity on the size of the pieces. 

Now, the disaster of all disasters. This was NOT anything resembling egg foo young. This was a potato pancake with chicken and vegetables on top. What the hell is that?  

Egg foo young is an egg patty with bean sprouts and chicken INSIDE the patty. This was nothing resembling egg foo young. 

We went here because believe it or not this was selected as the BEST Chinese restsurant. 

UPDATE:  3/6/2018. Health inspection grade of D!!! 

Multiple violations including lack of hand washing and storing open meat and pork. 

Most disgusting place ever."}
{"text":"Not sure where the bad reviews are coming from... I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp and it wasn't dry and it was full of flavor! Plus, the delivery was really quick! I will definitely keep ordering delivery from King Wong!"}
{"text":"After seeing such great reviews here on Yelp I was excited to give it a shot. As soon as we walked in the woman that works there was extremely nice giving us a menu and table to decide what we wanted for take out. We ordered two entrees, after seeing Yelp reviews I really wanted to try the General Tso's chicken and I left the 2nd entree up to Eric. I told him he shouldn't choose another chicken dish but he was adamant about getting orange chicken. Well, they both came out tasting the same and pretty much looking the same. It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. They threw in 2 free egg rolls but I wasn't a fan, I ate half of one. The portions were very large that is the truth! Definitely worth the $8 per entree. I really want to come back or try their delivery so that I can give other dishes a shot, but as of what I've tried so far it was a 3-star experience."}
{"text":"I think I've already said this a million times to people, this has to be hands down the best Chinese food I have had! It looks super sketchy where the location is but, I have discovered that little holes in the wall like this place, are the best, this place never disappoints me. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious and super friendly!!!!! Portion size is always on point. Great for large family meal I feed 7 people"}
{"text":"Who knew I would find great Chinese food at a hole in the wall.
I picked up kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef for a quick dinner during my business trip. It's in an aging strip mall with no decor to speak of but the food was simply great.
The lady owner is sincerely kind.
Will come back again no doubt."}
{"text":"Spicy orange chicken is a must! Super tender, juicy white meat chicken! The Spicy Wong's chicken was also good but it didn't have as much flavor. I wish it had baby corn and broccoli and peppers. 

Everyone was so friendly! Free water, free soup! Large portions and the right price. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly service. Even got complimentary egg rolls and wontons! Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. Decided to check this place out, as it got several good reviews on yelp. The lady who helped us was very nice, but unfortunately, their customer service was not enough. We ordered the kung pao chicken and teriyaki chicken, both of which were flavorless. The teriyaki chicken was watered down, and the meat was chewy and gross. Kung pao chicken was bland. Would not come again."}
{"text":"We've ordered from king wongs twice now and we Love this place! The last time we ordered at 920 and they close at 930 and were happy to still deliver. We've had the general tso's, sweet and sour chicken and the pot stickers ( our new favorite)  and they were all great! Sam the delivery guy is so nice and very prompt.  My boyfriend thinks Sam sounds like Casey kasem, which for him is a plus!"}
{"text":"Got a craving for Chinese Food this morning . . . new job, new location . . . hence . . . look for something close that I can get to and get back within the lunch hour . . . chose . . . King Wong.

From the outside . . . it is definately not a place i would stop at on a whim . . . but  . . . I have committed . . . SURPRIZE . . . the food was really, really good.

While the interior decor was nothing to really talk about . . . but the food . . . it was suprizingly good.  Had the Mongollian Beef Lunch Special . . . Egg Drop Soup, Egg Roll, Crab Puff, Fried Rice, and the main dish the Mongollian Beef.

As always . . . the main question . . . Will I be back . . . most definately . . . I think I found a new go to lunch restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been searching for almost 2 years for a place that offers Chinese food resembling the style I used to get back east. Service is great, prices are amazing, and the food, while not fancy, is precisely what I want from a delivery or take out place."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this restaurant.  I found them here on Yelp and their reviews are excellent.  So, I thought I'd give them a try.  I ordered House fried rice, Shrimp fried rice and 2 orders of egg rolls.  The lady who took my order said she was going to give me another order of egg rolls for free because it's Christmas.  How sweet of her to do that!  When I arrived the lady who took my order and another older lady greeted me with big smiles.  Very friendly and inviting.  The restaurant itself is small, but looked clean and quiet.  But, I'll probably only do take outs since it's on my way home from work and convenient.  Anyway, the fried rice was OK.  I had to doctor it up with soy sauce and a tiny bit of sugar (try that on any food to make the flavor come alive!).  Once I did that then it was delicious.  The egg rolls were nice, hot and crunchy.  The filling is just a typical filling which consisted of lots of cabbage.  But, I was fine with that.  So, all in all I like this place.  The flavor of the fried rice could have been better, but it's good enough for me."}
{"text":"What delight. First, the people are great setting a standard for connecting. Second, the ambiance, simple strip mall storefront with minimal decoration is clean and roomy. Next, we talk the important stuff, the food. Outstanding! The egg rolls were as good as I've had. The soup was flavorful. We were given a tea egg from China to try--delicious. And this all before to entrees, both of which were excellent. Special kudos that the veggies were toothsome and the sauces nicely seasoned. The cost of this feat was $21 for the two of us and containers to take home were quite full; a great deal."}
{"text":"I rated them a 1 because I wouldn't order from them again.  My experience was more \"not good\" than \"bad.\"

My order:  Hot and Sour Soup, Chicken Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, and WonTon Chips; it came with 2 free egg rolls.

Egg Rolls:  I think they used the thickest, toughest leaves of the cabbage for these egg rolls; every bite was like biting into the part of the cabbage leaves that nobody wants.

Chicken Fried Rice:  I tend to measure Chinese restaurants by the quality of this dish and each time I try a new place, it's one of the things I always order.  King Wong had what was probably the worst I have ever eaten.  The chicken was dry and tough and had no flavor....and I don't know how else to say it but it was like it was old.

Kung Pao Chicken:  I think they used the same chicken as in the fried rice, dry, tough, and old.   Aside from that, it was fine.  That's the best thing I can say about it.  

WonTon Chips:  I was actually quite tickled to see these on the menu because they're like Chinese crack to me and I rarely see them offered.  And even though I chowed on them like the had crack inside them, I was not oblivious to the fact that about half of them were considerably darker than the rest, suggesting that they had been fried, left out for a long time, and then fried again.

Hot and Sour Soup:  The broth had that \"kick\" that I enjoy when eating this dish.  Not much else to say about it.

I don't want to discourage people from going here; the lady on the phone who took my order was very nice and conscientious and made absolutely certain that she had my order right, and they did deliver the food faster than the 45 minutes they had suggested would be required.  For me, however, the bottom line with a restaurant is the food, and while i really wanted to be happy with it, every bite was a mouthful of disappointment."}
{"text":"On a business trip in Phoenix and craved for Chinese Food.  As usual I checked Yelp and found this place with good reviews. I decided to try it out and had my food delivered to my hotel.  The food was excellent and very flavorful.  I can easily say this is one of the best Chinese food I've had.  Wish I could stay longer and try out some of the other dishes.  Food was delivered on time as promised so that was another plus."}
{"text":"Just fantastic.

I was in the area running an errand and decided to order takeout. Ordered the House Lo Mein, Beijing Style Chicken and pot stickers. The man on the other end of the line asked if I wanted free egg rolls. Do I want free egg rolls?! You bet your bottom dollar!

All of the food was simply delicious. In addition, it was very inexpensive considering the quality and amount of food. The owner is a cute little woman who is extremely nice and humble. 

The next time I am in this area, I will order takeout again."}
{"text":"Finally after living on this side of town over a year I have a Chinese place with hot fresh food made while I waited not sitting in a pot on the stove.
Quick friendly service..free drink and egg rolls etc 
I am extremely happy I found them and will be back again in the near future.

They also have a huge delivery area."}
{"text":"I'm gonna sum it up to not a good experience. I ordered Twice Cooked Pork, Egg Rolls & Crab Puffs...a'la carte by the way. I was disappointed when I lifted open that ever so classy styrofoam lid...WHERE'S MY PORK.!! Now twice cooked pork is usually pork simmered, cut into strips then later pan or wok fried with veggies.

Taking a moment to come to terms with this tragedy. I had to know what this was so I contacted the restaurant hoping it was a wrong item. No....this is what they called twice cooked pork it's essentially plain pork chops later deep fried like Panda's Orange Chicken.

Now I'm an open minded person. When life gives you lemons make hard lemonade. So I tried it....didn't like it. It wasn't the taste, now it certainly didn't taste as I was expecting it to originally. I at least now know I don't want my pork chunks deep fried in batter.

Now the rice is okay, the crab puffs okay. The egg rolls oh my goodness they also have the pork chop chunks too....I stopped eating, because I started laughing.

The food was well cooked and crispy. The sauce on the deep fried pork chops was good. The egg rolls....not good, but they do have a vegetarian variant I should have ordered me thinks.

Will I be ordering from here again...probably. Now I already hear...\"why would you do this again..blah..blah.!\" I'll do it because they may have something I like...that's deep fried. Orange Chicken..huh. Not every restaurant craps diamonds...at Oregano's I don't like their pizza, but I love their Alfredo pasta."}
{"text":"Was about to order delivery,dinner for one, (bf took the car to work) BUT your order has to be over 15 dollars! Guess I'll just have to pick up some other day looks like pizza night :("}
{"text":"Don't judge a place by its outside look.  :-). Food was pretty yummy!!!    great prices great food.   Quick service.  Definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"We walked in and felt right at home. We ordered takeout and it came with tons of extras for a reasonable price. It was ready super fast and it was delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food taste very nice there and waitress are so friendly and caring. The place doesn't look fancy but we are there for a decent Chinese lunch and King Wong certainly delivered what we are looking for. Highly recommended Mongolian beef and chicken with garlic if you are a chilli person!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for greasy ghetto Chinese food, this is it! My wife and I just got out of the airport and we're craving for some fast, cheap Chinese food. Not only did we get that, but it was right next to an AA clinic. There was a guy passed out on the sidewalk next door! The Chinese lady taking our order was very old school. And who I'm guessing was her husband was counting money at a table nearby. Yup, very ghetto, but we were starving so we stayed. Next time, we'll probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in central Phoenix that I've tried. The employees are very friendly specially (Chen) I believe that's how it's spelled if not I apologize but he's amazing and very friendly makes ordering there even better. We normally do delivery and so far it's always ready in 30min which is amazing. And they always throw in free food depending on the amount of money you spend. We've ordered for the past 4 years and they haven't gotten any of my orders wrong so that's a big plus!! Their house fried rice is the best!!"}
{"text":"Got delivery to our downtown Phoenix hotel, and it was toward closing time, so I'll knock the two stars up to three for service. But the fried rice is incredibly salty, the egg rolls are weird, and the chicken is all covered in that weird puffy batter that no sauce can fully hide.

If you are desperate, they're your best option for Sunday night delivery, but try not to put yourself in that situation."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The service was great and everyone working made us feel so welcome. Plus the food was great and came in large quantities. Will make this a regular stop for Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food was not food. The flavored were bland and not enticing the quality of the meat is not good. The rice was dry and crunchy. The crab wontons soggy with oil and not much filling. It was just an unpleasant eating experience."}
{"text":"So my review is a little mixed because we have ordered from here many times and it is usually pretty decent. I would say we order take out from here at least once a week for myself and the hubby, we love Chinese food! I have had a few problems and normally they address them, but nothing major. 

Yesterday I ordered the kung pao chicken and shrimp and two orders of crab puffs, it was around 20$ with delivery and tip. 

Now I open the box and find the contents to be about half empty and slopped over to one side, no problem, probably just moved around while driving, so I fork them back and they lay neatly in the box, now its just like half the box though. Normally the food is packed in there and you see a nice mix of chicken, shrimp and veggies! This time however, all I see is soppy brown liquid, a ton of veggies and 4 pieces of shrimp and about 10 pieces of the tiniest saddest chicken pieces ever! Yes, I actually counted them, that is how sad looking they were! Normally the pieces are about 2-3 inches and look like vibrant delicious food. These looked like 1/2 inch pieces that were left over from someone elses meal. 

I called in and was put on the phone with manager, who after listening to my complaint, yelled at the kitchen staff in their own language, came back on the phone and Assured me that the kitchen made it properly, although I was staring at the evidence that they did not. After going back and forth with him and explaining that I have ordered this at least 20 times recently and I am Sure this is not what it is suppose to look like, he says and I quote

 \" I serve this many times today and no one complain only you \"

Ok Great buddy, I dont care if you served it a billion times, I did not pay 20$ to eat tiny veggies drenched in a bad sauce with someones left over chicken. So he tells me after arguing that Next time I order he will hook me up with 3 free shrimp, great, but uh what am I suppose to eat tonight for dinner, cause eating what appears to be someones left overs does not look appealing. He says Sorry I cant do anything for you, I wont send someone back. 

So basically ... If you're OK with giving them money and NOT getting what you paid for, feel free to order from this place. I hate to give a bad review to a small family joint like this, but seriously if you have the audacity to tell me you Cannot give me something that I paid for because it is not convenient for you, well you officially lost our business. 

TL:DR -- Go somewhere else for your Chinese fix, their attitude and food is not worth it. To the \"manager\" have a slice of humble pie my dude, it wouldn't hurt you, your food is not perfect and you can admit to making a mistake instead of alienating your customers over a few pieces of chicken and shrimp and calling them liars. Bad bad service."}
{"text":"King Wong is the truth. Maria, I don't know what her job is exactly, but she was more than attentive and continuously asked us if we wanted more food...which is crazy because the portion size is incredible. Food was amazing."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Chinese place. It is clean, cheap, the food is good, and the service is excellent.  We were given free egg drop soup with lots of wontons and even offered seconds.  The food was fresh. The servings large. And way cheap! I don't know why you'd go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great waitress, quick food. Perfect little chinese place! Beef and broccoli was really good and the egg rolls were different than normal, really interesting."}
{"text":"This place is seriously awesome! When you call in they always remember to give you something free depending on your order! They are always nice and speedy! Food is delicious and priced perfect! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"So while looking for a local Chinese spot for take out I found respectable reviews for this spot. I have probably driven by it hundreds of times while going up 32nd St. after passing McDowell but before Thomas but never payed any mind to it. 

I gave it three stars and some easy fixes could make it four. To start the young woman answering the phone was friendly, smart and helpful. I told her I was on yelp looking at pictures of previous menus since the old website was dead(just submitted request for yelp mod to update). She told me the new site and helped me pick dishes and said food ready will be ready in less than ten minutes. When I get there it was ready but since they have only have two phone lines I had to wait 5-10 minutes until the card could be processed. The majority of the crew is Asian the manager/owner looks to be something other than Asian , likely eastern European middle Eastern. He was taking an order and someone in house was talking on the other line so no way to have my payment go through. He apologized and thanked me for my patience.  

Ordered Spicy chicken wings came with free egg rolls. Beijing style Hot & Sour Chichken and Mongolian Beef. Came out to about 20 bucks. 

Wings appeared fried with very light batter and some type of chili sauce drizzled across the top. Though it doesnt sound exciting I would get it again. The egg rolls were big and even though they were free I wouldn't mind paying for them next time. The chicken dish had like an orange chicken vibe more doughy not a lotta flavor. As you can see very generous portion but not my style. The mongolian beef had a good sauce and as you can see is mostly white onions shallots and beef. The beef was cooked right decent cut but I onions to beef ratio was opposite of what I expected. 

I hope to find some new dishes to try that I like."}
{"text":"The most delicious freshes. Chinese food on the east side. Whenever I am in this area I already know what I am gonna eat :)"}
