{"text":"Terrific entree menu with daily specials. I ordered the spicy sausage penne in tomato sauce and it was delicious. Great service and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place! This has started to become a Saturday brunch tradition :) The salmon pizza is really good. And always friendly service. The yukon fries are the best!"}
{"text":"The food and beer selection here is decent, but I find this restaurant overpriced for what it is. I can't say I've ever had a bad meal here, but your money could probably go a lot further elsewhere.

It's very close to where I live, so I've been a number of times, but otherwise, its location in a plaza just east of Main Street Markham makes it easy to overlook."}
{"text":"Salad was willty. Pasta dishes were cold on the surface and hot in the middle. You could tell they had been sitting out for a while and weren't heated prior to being brought out. But that wasn't even the worst part - the meat portions in these dishes were a joke. No complaints about service but nothing to brag about either. Definitely one of the top 3 worst restaurants i've ever been to. No one was happy with their dishes."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, reasonably priced, extensive menu and... most importantly, it was wheelchair accessible!"}
{"text":"I'm torn with Southside...
The food was great and the menu was very extensive. To start we had the escargot, calamari and bruschetta. Presentation was great on all of them and they were very tasty (the grilled calamari itself wasn't incredible but was served with tomato and capers on toasted baguette with olive oil and a balsamic reduction so that made up for it).

I had the mac & cheese which had goat cheese and aged chedder in it and was the cheesiest thing I had ever eaten in a good way. My friend had the wild boar burger which was an exotic choice and was also very good, although a little disappointing that it mainly tasted like beef :) 

The service was incredibly friendly so I feel bad leaving this comment, but it was horrendously slow. It was a Sunday night and there were about 15 tables seated but they only had ONE WAITRESS. I'm told that's all they ever have too. The poor woman was very nice but there was no way she could serve that many tables properly. It was over 20 minutes before we got asked what drinks we'd and were given menus, then since we had a larger party she kept having to run to the kitchen in between people's orders to enter them because she couldn't remember them all. That's fine I couldn't either, but get a note pad!!

If I learned they had 2 waitresses I'd be there all the time but until that moment unfortunately, and it really is unfortunate because the food was good, I won't likely be going back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were there today for supper she ordered a coke they brought a diet coke. I ordered the hot sausage pizza it was very runny. I couldn't eat it like a pizza had to use a knife and fork. We had two different servers I think one was the owner but neither of them had smiles on their face and when they asked if they could pack up the order they brought the bill. Apparently we were not ordering coffee or dessert."}
{"text":"I had been here before for their burger night and was half decent, little slow as they seem to struggle with the amount of service people.   

Came in a Sunday evening.   Took about an hour from sit down to meals arrived.   They had a $10 entree special with what looked like good selections which we chose a few from.   

Ravioli with rose sauce, really looking forward to this one but the ravioli was not cooked.   

Also chose the $10 entree of souvlaki with potato and salad.  Potatoes were undercooked, chicken was dry , sitting all night perhaps.  

Thirdly, off the menu a beef dip which was described as \"piled high\", was dry and far from high , 2 layers thick of sliced beef.  

The kids meal, no complaints on the grilled cheese but then again no kids ever complain.   

So I am not sure why it took an hour as it wasn't so busy at 7:30-8:30 on a Sunday evening and I was really hoping this place was better as its local and would be a nice place to put on the rotation.  

Not sure I will return again but it so convenient and really hoping I see some positive reviews here before returning."}
{"text":"Nice little place in my neighbourhood. The pasta was quite nice. A little rich in the sauce though. Their burgers were quite good but it's only my first time coming... Will def come back more in the future to try their other foods"}
{"text":"Went on a recent Friday night to find the place relatively empty... Husband said he had heard good things about the place, so decided to give it a try.

I ordered the meatloaf and my husband had the omelette/breakfast all day plate.  He said his was 'so-so'; omelette wasn't made very well.  The meatloaf was TERRIBLE.  It came with a 'baked' potato that was clearly baked two days ago and reheated in the microwave.  It was chalky and just plain gross.  The meatloaf was lukewarm and was so unappetizing.  Hospital food or a TV dinner came to mind.  

Service was slow and so-so. Would never ever go here again."}
{"text":"Went there for st patty's day.  Enjoyed their green beer selection.  Their escargot with cheese and spinach is also great."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Markham. They don't have a lot of servers, so service may be stalled depending on how busy it is. But food is definitely above average. Love coming here for burgers, steak, fish and pastas."}
{"text":"When I saw the $10 entrees specials promotion on Southside Restaurant and Bar, I am IN! 

This is a neighbourhood restaurant I drove by almost everyday and it is next to my favourite library in Markham. On this Wednesday night, though with the Leaf's game on, the place was empty aside from a handful of people.... 

I don't blame them, this place just looked dark from the outside, I almost just drove by thinking that it was closed. 

The selections on the $10 entrees are pretty good: burgers, fish, pasta, and even curry chicken and pad thai!! 

Blackened Mahi with veggie and rice ($10) was nicely done with a nice touch of spice. The portion though on the small side but at that price point,  I am not complaining!

The decor here is surprisingly classy and warm with dark mahogany furnishing. 

The service from the lone waitress was efficient but kind of cold...."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was please to enjoy my evening at Southside Restaurant and Bar, I was attending my niece's confirmation and this is where my sister picked to have the reception afterwards. I ordered the fish and chips option from their special menu, I found the quantity of food to be the right amount not leaving me over stuffed or still hungry. The fries were tasty and the fish was done just right! I asked around to everyone in regards to their meal and they all seemed very pleased and impressed. My brother-in-law order the meatloaf and my sister ordered the open face beef sandwich, both said it was filled with flavour and an excellent choice.

Our server for the evening was amazing. we had such a large group and I was SURPRISED at how short the wait time was from the time we ordered to the time we received our food. 

I use to play poker at this place years ago and when I found out we were heading there afterwards I though to myself \"oh that hole in the wall\" little did I know this place had been newly renovated leaving me speechless when I walked in. It had a very elegant feel to it even though it is the neighborhood Bar..

I must say I will most likely be heading back at some point in the near future..."}
{"text":"Service was way too slow as only one server however the place is nice and clean and food was good.  Unfortunately service is so poor however there was only one waitress so poor management as felt bad for her being on her own.  I do want to give this place one more try but will need to be on a day that I have time and ok with waiting."}
