{"text":"I have tried several items on the menu - they usually have a great winterlicious menu. 

I recommend the grilled lobster sandwich with fries"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, portions were tiny. As expected, I had the most expensive entree on the menu at the time, some kind of boar bacon situation. The meat was extremely tough and stringy and so salty that I was basically eating a salt block. The potatoes and veggies on the side were a purée and a total joke, looked and tasted like a Gerber baby food horror. My two companions each had burgers, they were decent $35 burgers in that they didn't get food poisoning from them but really nothing to write home about. 

Ambiance was ok only because it was deserted and thus patrons were able to converse comfortably and privately. We dined wine cellar level which only had two other tables occupied. 

Dinner service was simply ok, stiff and utterly humorless as can be expected from this type of joint. However the guy serving our bread was superb. The guy settling our bill at the end was extremely rude and belittling. He refused to split the bill for the three of us, said we should have specified at the beginning of the meal. Ok a little oversight on our part but this has never been a problem at any other restaurant. I mean your restaurant is empty right now, we turned a not paltry bill for you, could you please not yell at us in front of the rest of your staff and the dining room. Unprofessional does not even begin to describe his deportment. What gross behavior for an establishment that pretends to be upscale. Thoroughly disturbing experience. 

I recommend you go literally anywhere else if you must eat in the financial district. Even if you are expensing your meal, just remember you'll still have to sit through food that has little to no culinary merit. Bymark embodies amateur hour at its finest."}
{"text":"I became fun of Bymark after my first visiting. I enjoyed dinner with my family there. The coat check lady is nice, she gave us warmest welcome! They have fantastic food and customer service! The staff there is patient, and they really concern about you! Will come back again"}
{"text":"Adding to Kelly B's review: 
Service great, but restaurant was dead, so would've been appalling if it wasn't great! Patio was great! Comfy & cool atmosphere!
Now on my FOOD POISONING! My lobster ravioli was DISGUSTING (as my sister said in her review). Very little lobster, pasta was hard & thick, & spices were so overwhelming. I think they put so much spice to cover up the fact that food was OFF! I shared my dish with bro-in-law since I detested flavour, and we BOTH were VERY SICK for 1/2 day. Woke up at 5am & basically stayed in washroom till noon. Getting food poisoning at such a fancy, expensive restaurant is surprising, but true. I'll NEVER GO AGAIN, except maybe 4 drinks on patio!"}
{"text":"A few details to start. A business lunch, tight timeframe of 1.5 hours for lunch. You would think that Bymark would be on point for everything, from service to food. But sadly it misses the mark on time management. Service was great except a bit too slow, even after I mentioned we had to be out of there at 1:30 sharp. Maybe it was the kitchen that was lazy and the server was just a victim of it. I had a lobster grilled cheese sandwich and it was  just ok. Too rich for my taste. Onion rings that come with were not cooked enough. Too bad because the place has great reputation."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Friday for lunch and was extremely disappointed in the service. Upon arrival we sat for 15 minutes, and our server did not make an appearance. We finally had to get the attention of a hostess to ask who are server was. Once we ordered each course was extremely slow. Our server \"D\" was unattentive and never came to ask how anything was. My pasta arrived luke warm at best. It took us 2 hours to get through lunch. I've dined at Bymark 4-5 times in the past and this was a clear miss for me."}
{"text":"Upscale and classy establishment. Food here is too good to be true (common for Chef Mark McEwan's creations) but just a tab bit expensive!

I came here for summerlicious and also once for my birthday so i've tried both menus. It's rare to find that the -iicious menu is just as good as the regular one!"}
{"text":"Bymark is pretty swanky. It's part of that whole business district group of resto-bars that get all the action. There's Kei which is the new kid on the block, old standard, Canoe and Bymark. I imagine the power-lunches at this joint can be pretty intense, but I've always liked it at night for cocktails before hitting a dance floor. One, because that's the quietest time, and two, because the service is excellent. It's a good place for a date and if you like to eat at the bar and have good conversation with the bartender. But, my top pick of when to bring someone here, would be to impress a potential boss, or mentor. It's more ego than sex for sure."}
{"text":"Went to their Winterlicious dinner in Feb 2010, the food tastes okay.  Service is as good as it gets for Winterlicious.  But I didn't feel really well after the dinner.  My friend and I purposely didn't order the same items, and she was alright after.  Hence, 2 stars only for Bymark."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great decor. One of Toronto top restaurants. The Beef tenderloin is THE BOMB however if you go for Winterlicious or Summelicious you'll never get the real deal but Mark mcEwan can cook but you better go on a real actual day and not on promo. Anyway its classy, sexy and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Unremarkable to barely passable offerings (burger is alright) and an unprofessional, unaccommodating and very snarky staff. I beg of you to patronize literally any other establishment in the financial district unless you like food that tastes of pure salt and a waiter that refuses to split a bill."}
{"text":"Lobster taco was excellent, sea bass was a bit too greasy but still pretty good. Five stars to the dessert and the presentation of the food."}
{"text":"Let's face it. Anyone who goes here doesn't really care about the food, do they? If you want the best of Mark McEwan you go to North 44. If you want a nice place to take clients/business associates that is close to the office then this is the place. You can get in and out with minimal hassle and has the added convenience of being near all the transportation hubs. Service is competant and food has a nice Canadian flair. The bison tenderloin was beautiful but the absolute hit of the night was the lobster poutine. Our out of town guests could not stop talking about it. Well done!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto hands down. Wife and I come here a couple times a year as it is expensive but well worth it. Lobster poutine is a must have every time you come here. 
The place is classy, staff and service is always great and food is top notch! Run, don't walk to this place."}
{"text":"As a visitor to Toronto, I did a fair amount of menu research before I came.  Luckily, I chose Bymark as one of the restaurants to visit.  The second I sat down I asked if they could do a tasting menu for me (after being disappointed by a lack of tasting menu the night before somewhere else).  They said it was no problem, and they even did wine pairings.  

The food was outstanding.  The menu had just changed.  I haven't been able to stop telling people about the mushroom dish and the foie gras dish.  They were both well-balanced, seasoned perfectly and quite creative (the other dishes were also very good, but these were the standouts).  The chef came out twice to talk to me and the server was great too.  I loved the ambiance of the restaurant - definitely matched the elegance of the food.  

I have already recommended this restaurant to people I knew would be in the Toronto area.  Almost worth flying back there just to eat that foie again..."}
{"text":"I went to eat at Bymark one randomly evening after some shopping downtown with my boyfriend. The place was gorgeous and food was good. We ordered drinks as well and the waiters were very friendly and professional I actually didn't understand why the place seemed so empty on a Friday evening because I surely enjoyed my experience. Expect to spend at least $200 if you want to drink (2 people) but it was worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for my mothers birthday. She had received a gift card. Now if you haven't heard of Bymark you should know that it is extremely pricey fine dining. It is, however, worth every cent. 
The food literally melted in my mouth. My mom and I got martinis. Mine tasted like Skor bar, and hers tasted like refreshing lemonade. Hers even had a daisy as a garnish! Also, I work in a bar and know about all the liquors and how much they usually go for. These were fifteen dollar drinks that had three premium liquor shots in them, which means you get each shot for around five dollars. Amazing. 
On another note, my family wouldn't usually be the clientele of a restaurant like that. We are by no means in poverty, but if we hadn't gotten a gift card we wouldn't have even been able to afford to look at the food. The waiter, on the other hand, was lovely with us. I have seen some fine dining waiters become very snobby with guests that definitely can't normally afford fine dining restaurants. Most-likely afraid that they won't be able to afford their tip. He was not like that in the slightest. His service was extremely attentive, we wanted for nothing. 
All in all it was a lovely experience. If you want to splurge for a fine-dining meal, I highly suggest you do it here. You get everything you pay for."}
{"text":"I am quite the foodie, and since I moved to Toronto from Vancouver 4 months ago, it's been my mission to try all the highly recommended restaurants.

Well, after trying over 30 of em, Bymark is definitely in the top 3.

The service was excellent, our waiter was friendly, helpful, and present whenever we needed him.

The ambiance is lovely, we had a cozy banquette, and the lighting is warm.  

The best part was the food.  We ordered the Shrimp Tacos which were scrumptiously flavorful and the Gravlax  was a tantalizing mixture of textures.

My main course was the Yellowfin Tuna.  I tend to order Tuna a lot... and often, well good tuna, is good tuna.  But this tuna, was outstanding.  Every bite melted in my mouth- I was stuffed but I couldn't stop eating it!

Oh and the Truffle Mash is ++yummy!

Coming from a very selective eater, this places Rocks."}
{"text":"3 outs of 5! Overpriced and overhyped burgers! I recommend the lobster poutine"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Love the bread selection at the start of the meal. Shrimp tacos are my fav app here. Lobster poutine appetizer has increased in price to a whopping $38 and the portion size reduced compared to previous visits. For that -1 star. Otherwise high quality food and always a treat."}
{"text":"Delicious Summerlicious menu. Our table had a number of items. Personally I had Salmon Poke, Braised beef cheek pasta and S'Mores for dessert. Salmon was fantastic. Main and dessert were good choices, and others at the table liked their choices of pork main and Ahi tuna. Caesar was just a Caesar.  Great service from our waiter."}
{"text":"I went for the summerlicious for dinner for $45 with apps, main and dessert.

The experience was good.

The food is ok. Fish is a bit overcooked. The dessert is disappointed.

The place is a bit noisy.

I ordered a cup of tea. The tea costs $6. Pretty over priced.

I would prefer to go to Red Bistro or Rose water. The food is much better and comparatively cheaper."}
{"text":"Wow. What an amazing experience.

Went to dinner last Friday, for the BF's birthday. I couldnt be more impressed. Here is what I loved:

(1) Ambiance: 10/10. Amazing lighting and decor. Although gives you the corporate feel, it doesnt intimidate and still leaves you warm.

(2) Service: 10/10. I truly couldnt rave enough about our waiter. He was super friendly and helpful. When I told him I was a vegetarian, and couldnt order anything off of the Ap menue, he got the chef to make me an amazing Salad. My Thanks also goes out to the kitchen and especially the Chef, who really accomodated my dietary restrictions. 

(3) Food: 10/10. I got the Salad and the BF got Shrimp Tacos. My salad was beautiful, with heirloom beets, goat cheese, carmelized walnuts and flowers. My dinner date was very impressed with the Tacos. For main, I got the Scallops and my BF got the Surf adn Turf. The scallops were plenty and so rich and satesfying I couldnt finish. Same with Surf and Turf.

(4) Wine: 10/10. Incredible.

(5)  Value: In the end we ended up spending around $300. Considering the service and the food it was amazing value, and we'll definately go back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal wine, food, and atmosphere!
Did not visit the upstairs bar, but the restaurant itself was absolutely amazing!
A bit pricey, but so worth it! You definitely get what you pay for! World of flavours in your food... great taste!
I go there often and I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go for dinner!

My boyfriend took me there for our anniversary and it was wonderful!  Very nice romantic atmosphere and the food was amazing as well as the service.  

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Shrimp taco is the must get, we love it so much even get the McEwan market to do catering for our private functions. 

Great main choices, black cod is always cooked to perfection, short ribs always melts in the mouth. 

Their bread is amazing too, I have to force myself to stop eating it otherwise wouldn't be able to finish the main. Side Lobster protein is bomb to top off the experience."}
{"text":"We had the truffled burger, braised short ribs (which I no longer see on the menu), and a dessert trio.  The food was good and the service was good, but we felt it was overpriced.  I didn't feel the food was extraordinary enough to warrant the prices.  Especially so because the interior of the restaurant looked run down (as of July 2013).  The tables had edges and corners that looked like they'd been chewed on and the chairs/benches had worn down fabric.  I was not at all impressed by the appearance of the restaurant and it was actually quite a turn off.  If you're going to charge high prices for your food, your dining room needs to look the part."}
{"text":"For a high end restaurant, I wasn't too keen on the basementy feel of Bymark. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious overall. Our starter of beef tartar was amazing. The lobster poutine is a must try! Your brain says lobster and fries?? But it is so delicious. My main of bass had too much Asian vinaigrette on the vegetables. Our icecream sundae for dessert was good, but not special. The server was very knowledgable about the wine list and helped me pick one to match my bass. At the end of our meal, the front of house manager saw us waiting for a second to pay our bill and he literally ran over to bring us the machine. Based on our apps, I think Bymark has some amazing food to offer. I think a second visit to try some different mains would be good."}
{"text":"Visited Bymark for Summerlicious dinner. It was good but not amazing.  The ambiance is nice and service is adequate. The lighting is a bit too dark for me but this is just personal. 

The dishes are generally good and I did enjoyed the food but they are not memorable.  The following were ordered for our party:
- Heirloom Carrot & Avocado Salad 
- Calamari & Chorizo Sausage
- Pan Seared Halibut
- Pasta & Braised Short Rib Cacciatore
- Baked Alaska

May be the food are better from non-Summerlicous menu, but this probably would not be my first choice restaurant when spending at this price range."}
{"text":"October 1929.  Horace A. Mayweather was there.  This is what these fools are sending us to, and it is this kind of nonsensical bar which is taking us that way!  What happened to the comfort and sensibility of the Long Bar in the Raffles?  Good lord what is the world coming to?"}
{"text":"Went here with my family for lunch to celebrate my brother's promotion at work. Yes, it's a little pricey but it's fine dining, not some restaurant that you go to grab a bite on a daily basis. We ate outside as it was a beautiful day. The service is as good as you would expect for a restaurant of this calibre - a smiley hostess to take you to your table, friendly and knowledgable wait staff, etc. I ordered the lobster grilled cheese sandwich. This was the best grilled cheese I have ever had! It was a great combination of lobster, brie cheese and pancetta. It came with a tasty little side salad. They also make a mean caesar. It was strong - halfway through I was feeling a pretty potent buzz... ok, I was pretty drunk. The caesar was expensive but at least you only need the one. 

I'm a fan of the place, but I'll probably only go if it is a special occasion or someone else is footing the bill!"}
{"text":"I really like this place...the patio is really nice in the warmer months and it has a great atmosphere. I've been here several times for drinks and appetizers after work...it's never too crowded which is nice considering it's right in the financial district. I've really enjoyed everything I have tried here, the shrimp taco apps in particular. Although it has a great patio, great service and great food, the place is just a little too pricey to make it a regular hangout."}
{"text":"went here for 2014 summerlicious.   Ordered the following: calamari and chorizo sausage; pan seared halibut; baked alaska.  The portion size is decent but the presentation is not elegant.  The halibut was overcooked, not enough sauce.  I couldn't finish the dish.  Also,  extremely salty.  The dessert was ok.  The cake was dry but ice cream was smooth and silky.  The service was ok.  

I wouldn't go back here again.   The quality of the food certainly not worth 45$"}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday. Nothing on the Summerlicious Menu appealed to me, so I order a few appetizers (Caesar salad & grilled octopus and calamari). 

I didn't like the service at all. The server seemed annoyed with us."}
{"text":"First impression was good, liked the ambiance/decor 

The wine list is awesome and had a wide range to accommodate any budget 

We were3 people total and decided to go a little heavy on the appetizers

For starters we had 12 oysters the short rib some fries and 2 orders of grilled baby octopus and calamari 

All the apps were done very nicely and perfectly seasoned, I especially liked the octopus/calamari dish, the short rib was super tender and was everything you'd expect 

For our mains we all had the rib steak, it was cooked and seasoned perfectly 

Overall I would recommend this restaurant, especially for a lunch or dinner meeting 

Kudos to the waite staff

Overall it was an enjoyable meal and again the Waite staff was"}
{"text":"***4.5 Stars***

I am a big fan of Bymark!  If you are looking for a great date night with fantastic food and excellent service, this is your place.  I have been here on two occasions and I was not disappointed.  Everything is on point.

I highly recommend their steak.  They make wickedly good cocktails as well. 

I will definitely be back for an epic night out."}
{"text":"Bymark has a restaurant in the tunnels of Toronto as well as a bar that sort of \"peeps\" up to the street level.  My review is for the bar portion only.  

There was something unidentifiably cool about this bar -- a random glass-walled enclosure sitting outside the TD building in the middle of the financial district.  Leather couches, dim lights, soft background music, and an attentive & attractive staff.  A weird, deserted, distant, but warm kind of place.  Classy, modern, dark, high end.  

Something in me clicks with the atmosphere of the Toronto financial district.  During the holidays, it's gorgeous with the enormous Christmas tree outside and snow all around.  This bar is as close to outdoor seating that you can get in Toronto during the winter.

Wish I could tell you that the drinks were amazing, but I basically just drank the peatiest scotch I could find and an unknown but decidedly not small number of manhattans.  Which, yes, was amazing.  But how could it not be?"}
{"text":"The four of us had a great time at the restaurant. We enjoyed the shrimp tacos, the lobster poutine was interesting and our steaks were delicious. One steak was too raw but my boyfriend liked it when he got it back. The bernaise sauce is a must-have with the steak. It brings it to a whole new level. All in all, a wonderful time was had by all!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat but there is literally no view, it's a little dark and the food has a bit too much salt in it.  But, it has excellent portions, an extensive wine list and very good service.

I was happy with my roasted duck and would recommend it to people looking for a place to grab a quick bite after work in a sit-down setting."}
{"text":"Went to Bymark for a nice lunch and was highly impressed.  The decor is beautiful.  The service was excellent and the food was incredible.  Even though our meals were good portions, we couldn't turn down the dessert.  They offered us a plateful of small portions of various types of desserts.  Perfect for sharing!

Bymark is definitely pricey so I would only recommend it for a special occasion or if you're trying to impress someone."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, had $95 dry aged 45 day tbone that was a big let down. Was sort of tough and not very flavourful. Had better steaks at The Keg or buying medicore cut at grocery store to he honest. Not worth the money. For steak, better to stick to other places in toronto.

Dessert also nothing spectacular...apple donuts were cold and dry. Not much better than timbit at Tim Hortons.

On the positive side wine, atmosphere, and good company was nice. But overall felt i was let down by the food."}
{"text":"I remember my first time at Bymark - I was fresh out of business school, got the requisite job in downtown working at a bank and going out to eat, high-roller style. With my first few pay-cheques, I decided to take my parents and a good friend to Bymark - show what their progeny was made of.

Intro. It's hard to find any crummily designed restaurant right in the downtown core. Add in the McEwan touch and you have a restaurant swathed in beige's and greys with lounge-y Buddha Bar type of music. We went on a Friday night and the place was getting busy...and noisy. I had asked for a booth as it is spacious and roomy. As a tip, if you can ask for a booth, do. The tables inside the main room I find are just too close together and it gets loud...really loud.

Food. For appetizers, I had the foie gras and the combination of sweet and salty was amazing. Then, oysters served on a tiered platter - very fresh. For my main, I had the Bymark Burger which thankfully, can now be purchased at McEwan's. The portion is just right and not dry. I don't think the food at any McEwan establishment can be disappointing, and Bymark certainly does not. 

Ambiance. Befitting a business crowd. A place to let loose after work.

I don't think anyone would be disappointed in Bymark - it's got all the check-marks of a good restaurant: good location, posh-y atmosphere and food that will satisfy a hungry stomach at the end of a long day of hard work."}
{"text":"Great decor, decent food, but inattentive service that left us frustrated. I asked the waitress to put down that I had an allergy to parsley and cilantro (I have a strong aversion to those two herbs) but when my main course came, I found both in my food. The wait between courses was long, and the wait for any acknowledgement of us wanting to pay our bills with the machine was even longer. 

For $48 (Summerlicious 2016 menu), I will not even be coming back for prix fixe, let alone normally. Service should be much better at such a restaurant."}
{"text":"What a disappointing evening...the food was alright but quite frankly I don't enjoy It when I'm being made to feel as if they're doing me a favour by allowing me to eat there. My order was not correct and when I pointed it out to more than one person nothing was done about it. As well, I have food allergies...had called in advance & was told that it wasn't an
issue for them to accommodate me but once seated I was made to feel like an imposition. Missing Susur Lee."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice and the food is great but there is something a little bland about the atmosphere. The hostess wasn't very warm, I felt like she snubbed us because we were using the summerlicious menu.

tuna sashimi appetizer- 5/5
beef carpaccio-5/5
BBQ duck-4/5
halibut- 4/5
double chocolate cake-4.5/5 

the experience was good but it wasn't wow. repeat: probably not, too many restaurants to try"}
{"text":"The food quality itself is good but a few things went wrong:

1. No hostess for 5-10 mins during lunch hours (12:30pm).

2. When hostess finally served us, she didn't walk us to the table. Instead she walked half way and pointed at a table that clearly was not for us.

3. Found a piece of thread in my steak. Whole this is likely the threads chefs use to tie the meat together before cooking, it was left on after"}
{"text":"I attended this restaurant in the summer of 2011. Over three visits, I had the famous Bymark burger, the lobster sandwich, and by the special request of someone I was with, the lobster fries. I was not a fan of the burger as it was far too cheesy, it left a pool of grease on my plate, and the bun became very soggy. The lobster sandwich was OK, but was not something I would've ordered again. I think (it pains me to say this) the lobster fries would have benefitted without the lobster. Overall, it was not a bad experience, but nothing really stood out as great. The decor of the restaurant is trendy/upper class and the patio is a great place for a summer meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointed indeed! I work right across the street at 79 Wellington and have always wanted to dine at Bymark. Decided to make the most of the summerlicious menu and made reservations well in advance. I requested a corner table to celebrate my husband's birthday and was assured that they would try to accommodate us. We arrived on time and were seated right between a really loud group of people with almost no elbow room. The hostess wasn't courteous enough to ask if that table was suitable. This trend continued all evening - the waitress came and took our order without so much as a smile (we might as well have been at a Swiss Chalet) and then the food arrived. First course, my risotto was completely pedestrian and the peas were tasteless. For my main I had ordered the lamb on a bed of lentils and the lentils were terribly over-seasoned. Since the waitress never came by to ask us about our meal I had to flag her down and tell her the lentils were inedible. Shockingly - she mumbled a half-apology and walked away. 

This deplorable quality of service and food was even more surprising because we had enjoyed a wonderful meal at North 44 a few weeks before. I have never been so turned off by a supposedly \"high end\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times (one time for Winterlicious) and it has been delicious everytime, however, I came after not being here for 2 years and I can see why the restaurant is so dead on a Friday evening now. 

We ordered the lobster poutine for an appetizer and the portion has been cut more than half it's size. Still tasted good. For entree, my boyfriend had the tenderloin which was cooked perfectly except it was incredibly over salted. I ordered the jerk pork ribs with seared scallops and it too was super salty to the point where I didn't want to finish my small plate. I'm so sad to see the food go downhill as this was my favourite restaurant. 

The service is still great hence the 2 stars but it can't make up for the small portions and heavy hand on salt. Unfortunately I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love the duck liver! Two of us ate 3 mains that day. All of them were perfect. But not a fan of the dessert."}
{"text":"I am part of a monthly ladies supper club. We try out new places and it's been alot of fun thus far. We decided to go to Bymark because we were all curious and with Summerlicious in full swing, we figured we could try out a few options and not break the bank.

We were taken down to the lower level which was quite intimate. There was a beautiful glass wine cellar down there that I would like to one day own in my home!

The summerlicious menu was pretty decent. I have nothing to complain about with the food as it  was all pretty good.. nothing to rave about though either with the exception of.... The homemade which chocolate banana sucker and homemade ice cream... I definitely see myself returning just for that! It was amazing!

The service was pretty poor. We kept having to flag down our server to order, to get our bill, to pay our bill.... it was a bit defeating."}
{"text":"I enjoy both the lunch and dinner menus. Some of my best Bymark experiences involve cold beers and appetizers in the summer when the patio is open. The restaurant is on the pricey side but dishes are innovative with great attention to detail. Here's the good:

- Service is excellent and the staff knows the menu well. All my food inquiries are answered in a detailed manner. Food presentation is top tier.

- Love the Arugula and pickled beat salad, so refreshing and a good starter to beef entrees.

- Fish is always cooked perfectly. I tried the Miso black cod and the spring trout. Both are very good.

- Interesting sandwiches on the lunch menu including lobster grilled cheese, Veal and a delicious short rib sandwich. Prices are high for a sandwich - in the $20 - $30 range but they make a nice treat.

- I usually get a side order of roasted brussels sprouts at dinner, they melt in your mouth.

- They have a massive wine list but I stick with beer or soda if I'm heading back to work after lunch.

On the downside...

- Never tried the desserts. I find them overpriced - roughly $14 each. 

- The famous $35 burger was good but not worth the price in my opinion. I would stick with their $20 lunch burger which still seams a lot to pay for a burger (although it's a damn good burger). 

Highly recommended.

{"text":"A wonderful winterlicious experience!
(Despite the fact that I had a hard time finding the restaurant)
Went there for lunch and I enjoyed all three courses.
Had seared Albacore tuna sashimi to start with, the tuna was perfectly seasoned with interesting sauce. Being an Asian this dish was just on point for me. Loved the spicy peanuts in it!
Main: lightly smoked pork shoulder. Big portion! Liked the combination of black beans and some fruits in this dish because together they made the dish less spicy.
Dessert: Bailey's Brownie, heaven on earth! Bailey's mousse on top of the brownie made it less sweet and I also loved the crispy chocolate.
Service was good, they also offered a choice of whole wheat or white bread.
Was totally worth $28!"}
{"text":"Our Table of 2 celebrated a special Birthday on a Friday evening. We were seated outside on the patio, which is lovely for a warm evening.

We ordered wine and started with the Ontario Burrata ($19) and the Shrimp Tacos ($22). Both dishes were excellent in flavour. The tacos had varying hints of citrus and tasted very fresh.

For our mains, we had the 8oz filet ($40) and the Miso Black Cod ($42). Our sides consisted of green & yellow zucchni ($12) and Lobster Poutine ($14). The best dish was the cod - it was delicious! The remaining 3 dishes were not particularly special. Filet was cooked well; however, nothing really stand-out. The zucchini pieces were cooked inconsistently - some soft, some crunchy. Finally, the lobster poutine....we were not a fan.  We realized that poutine is a dish that should not be altered. The béarnaise sauce was clumpy and cold by the time it arrived.

Perhaps our disappointment was in the service. We overheard our server discuss and recommend the specials to the table next to us. However, they were not presented to us.

We were content with the meal but didn't think there was anything outstanding to allow us to return. Perhaps, would try a lunch time meal."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in the experience here. Varying qualities of food experienced across our party. Atmosphere was dark and quiet on a Saturday. Could be nice for an intimate date night or business lunch. Would not go back for dinner unless they made some changes."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience in winterlicious.

Cod cakes: fish tasted fresh and well-seasoned, covered by crispy crumb, flavored by creme sauce, recommended.

Steak tartare: compared to the tartare, I was more interested in those little pickled mushrooms.

Duck breast & ravioli: the breast was well-cooked. Each piece comes with skin and fat, combined with the red duck meat, tastes pretty good. The ravioli underneath was fantastic. Filled with spinach and shredded duck meat, mixed with their special sauce, deliciousss.

Rabbit tagliatelle: rabbit was delicious; pasta tasted hard, not my type.

Eclairs: little pastries cooled down my stomach. Chocolate mousse was smooth and silky, with cream and chocolate syrup, yum.

Apple crepes: same as I expected. Cinnamon oat crumble and sugared apple, so-so but was still good.

Service was great, not disturbing. Servers described dishes patiently. Casual ambient made, pretty relaxing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine selection. The underground dining room is a little sterile, but this appears to be more of a business restaurant anyway.  The only reason this is not 5 stars was the service - the waiter didn't introduce himself and just went straight into the orders - he seemed rushed which is not a good look for a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"Went to the Bymark as part of a conference event. The menu was fixed, but still everything was very good. The service was excellent. I started with the Chopped Caesar salad. I'm a Caesar Salad nut, so this was not up to my standards, The salad was decomposed with smoked tomato salsa, strip bacon, rye croutons, and grana padano Parmesan flakes. 6 out of 10. It was no longer a Caesar salad at that point. I then had the Classic 8oz Bymark Burger, comprized of brie de meaux, shaved truffle, grilled porcini mushrooms, on brioch burger bun. That was very good and the fries were perfect. 9 out of 10.  For dessert the Strawberry Shortcake, was very nice, well plated and beautiful to see, with vanilla mousse, spiced meringue, strawberry puree, and basil to give it an earthy tone. all in all the experience was excellent, so was the company and the wine!"}
{"text":"We went to Bymark last week for a business dinner and everything was on point

- Butter Poached Lobster Poutine:
Very addictive; chunks of lobster
- Ontario Burrata:
creamy and delish
- Lamb: 3 ways- Lamb chops, sausage and...forgot, but so good
Absoutely yummy
- Churros:
delicious; crispy, filled with dulce de leche, with chocolate dipping sauce on the side

We came on a Thursday night and it was really empty. Our meal (with a bottle of barbera and glasses of prosecco) came out to $500+ for 2 ppl; very pricy, but thankfully, it was a biz dinner! Definitely not for non-corporate dinners!"}
{"text":"This year was my 2nd try at Bymark summerlicous. 
I went with a big group of people. 
Enviorment was nice and the service was really good. Food actually came faster than i expected.
However, the taste of teh food were okay and not too impressed. 
I picked the calamari as appetizer, which i loved it.
However, all the main entires were overcooked and meat were really dry, which were very disappointed. 
Baked Alaska was one of the hardest dessert to make and surprisingly, it tasted really good .

Based on the main dish quality, i dont think i will go back next time. :("}
{"text":"I also came here for the Summerlicious price fixe lunch with my family. We'd heard really good things about this restaurant and I was also excited to eat at one of Mark McEwan's restaurants!

The service was pretty nice - our water was refilled several times during our stay and the lady serving us was really accommodating when I asked if I could switch the lemon cake I'd previously ordered for dessert with the ice-cream sandwich! The person serving the bread was very slow though (he came around almost right before we tucked into our mains) and the dish of butter he gave us only had three balls of butter even though our table clearly was for four (and strangely enough, it looked like one ball of butter had been removed?).

I ordered the beef carpaccio and it was alright. The beef had a sufficient amount of fat to have some flavour, but were not strong enough to stand up to the intense flavour of the pickled vegetables. The parmesan was incredibly stinky (in a good way!) but the dish as a whole was not spectacular. My mom had the tuna tartare and for some reason, I couldn't taste much tuna in it....none of the flavours really popped out at me.

The main course was really disappointing. We had the halibut cooked in the banana leaf and we were really excited when the servers arrived at the table to open up the packages for us. However, when they did, we were greeted with an unappealing grey mess that tasted far from spectacular. The flavour of the smoked banana leaf and the ginger used in the recipe were overpowering and the flakiness of the fish was due to the fact that it was overcooked. The root vegetables were a pleasure to eat though, perfected cooked and sweet in the way that they get after their starches have turned to sugar.

Although my dad and my sister's ice-cream sandwiches came out perfectly, my ice-cream had started melting. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had a bit more time to enjoy it (it was really tasty ice-cream!), BUT it was the best thing I'd eaten all day. The chocolate cookies it was sandwiched between were perfectly fudgy and a delight to eat. I was expecting not to like the banana lollipop as it was covered in white chocolate (most white chocolate available at supermarkets are over-sweetened and artificial-tasting, not creamy at all), but I was glad to be proven wrong! 

Overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience but I expected more from the Head Judge of Top Chef Canada :("}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review because this restaurant is VERY expensive and therefore should be 4 stars. I was there on a Monday night with my family. Service was excellent! But seeing as we were one of 3 tables, it would make sense that it was. My steak was way overdone - I asked for rare/medium rare and it came out a definite medium. The frites that you order on the side are far too small a portion. The mushrooms were delicious. The hamburger was also slightly overdone. My sisters lobster ravioli tasted ONLY of saffron - you could taste nothing else and the portion of the lobster in the ravioli was negligible. Even if there were 5 times as much lobster, you couldn't taste it due to the overwhelming spices. Also the pasta was undercooked. My dad wasn't crazy about his halibut - again, the dish was overwhelmed by spices. The tuna is incredible. The burrata salad was amazing. In the future I will stick to Bymark for cocktails and laughing my head off at the women who go there half dressed to meet a Bay St guy."}
{"text":"This place is great! The bartender was really quick and always ready with a fresh one when I was done. Offered to throw my bag behind the bar. Went after work on a Thursday and there was a big crowd on the patio. Great service and a great time."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. 

To be honest, there's nothing fantastic about it but it's great for business meetings and what not. 

The food is okay. (It's not bad neither is it fantastic) The ambience is nice and the service is good. 

There's also a bar upstairs, nothing out of the ordinary. Although they do have a wide selection of drinks. I'm not sure if they offer finger foods there cause I've never ordered one. 

It's an okay place but nothing fantastic"}
{"text":"I came here for the highly praised burger.

When I sat down I was fairly shocked by the price of the burger ... about $37 before tax!!! That was the most expensive burger I've ever had. It was an 8 ounce beef burger with a bunch of fancy toppings and a side of onion rings. 

However once I had a bite of the burger, I realized exactly why the burger was so expensive. I could instantly tell that the cut of the beef was of high quality beef. The toppings they used were very fresh and blended well together.

The burger lived up to the hype and the price. I'm still going to only give this a 4/5 because when I want a burger , I Usually want a greasy gross burger , not a gourmet styled. So I'm biased on my burger types :)"}
{"text":"Almost missed the place when I was walking...
I came here with my friend for Winterlicious (obviously). This place was recommended to us so I kind of did have high expectations. The entrance was a bit dim (like the rest of the restaurant and most \"fancier\" restaurants) and narrow. We got lost (plus a man we briefly befriended) finding the restaurant part as we first ended up upstairs, which seemed like a private event space. Once we found the front desk, we were asked if we wanted to do coat check. It was a nice gesture but we both kindly declined - unsure whether there is a fee to it but I'm pretty confident that there would be one.
It was trippy (haha) walking in as restaurant had a wall of mirrors that made the place seem indefinitely bigger. The room had a nice mix of backgrounds and occupations but taking into consideration how this was near/within the financial district, it was predominantly business persons. My friend and I ordered the steak tartare and cod cakes as appetizers, braised rabbit tagliatelle and the duck breast as mains, and chocolate eclairs and apple crepes as desserts. The waitress informed us that the tagliatelle was a pasta dish. Looking back, I'm not sure if I would take it as a situation of being a good server or as me looking like an uneducated guest. Could go both ways. 
Portions were small but it was also Winterlicious. The cod cakes tasted like fish sticks and I was having a hard time distinguishing it from the ones my mom used to make for me after school when I was younger. The mains were flavourful and contained what I would call more distinct sources of protein (rabbit and duck). Then dessert came and thats when I was like \"I have to write a review.\" When I saw the dishes, my friend and I both thought of the post ridiculing \"fancy foods\" (i.e. http://www.funnymeme.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/funny-memes-fancy-restaurants-be-like.jpg). Refer to the pictures and you'll know why. 
In the end, it was good because dessert is always good.
Would I come again? Probably not unless I was working in the area or if there was Winterlicious/Summerlicious again."}
{"text":"My review is a bit delayed.. but we had a wonder winterlicious dinner experience at bymark. 
Main entrance access is from the path underground (could be easily missed!). We got our coats checked right away. Romantic contemporary decor. Great winterlicious menu 

Highlights of our night: 
Baby octopus (just perfectly cooked... so important)
Seared albacore tuna sashimi (beautifully plated. felt like u were eating an abstract art piece).
Baileys Brownie (slice of chocolate heaven)
Great service without being too pushy 

Other comments:
Lobster poutine (overrated, no wow factor, no cheese curds!)
Slow braised beef strozzapreti pasta (kind of bland, not nicely plated like everything else) 
Not enough bread! They gave me a one small piece of cold bread.. i wanted more but he did not return! 

Service: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Decor ambiance 4.5/5"}
{"text":"It was really packed here for a weekday lunch!  So many suits and professionals dining together that it was actually a little bit loud.  Since it was am upscale spot, the lighting was dim and set the mood for a classy and intimate lunch venue.

I really liked the Lobster Grilled Cheese Sandwich! The bread was toasted with butter and the chunks of lobster were substantial. There was a slice of pancetta with the aged brie too which gave it some saltiness. The first few bites were salty for this reason but the lobster was really succulent and delicious.

What I also liked were their lemon garlic aioli that went so well with the fries. The tempura onion ring was actually really good too.  It was like a seasoned battered onion ring. It was cute that they put the fries into the hole of the onion ring; it was like an onion ring basket with fries in it.

After one half of the sandwich plus all of the fries and onion ring, I was already stuffed. It was really filling! I asked for my half to be packed away.

The 72 Hours Sous Vide Beef Brisket Sandwich was like a Korean style sandwich to me; almost like a bamh mi with kimchi."}
{"text":"Went here with folks from my new employer -we started in the upstairs bar area, overlooking the financial district. great martinis and people watching. Attentive and professional waitstaff. 

After our drinks, we moved downstairs for a table - we were early so service was extra prompt and attentive. Ended up with the rare 12 oz Canadian prime strip steak and Brussels sprouts with lardon. Both cooked to perfection, what you would expect for a place of this price point/ calibre. Probably 8 or 9 steaks landed at the table that night, raves all around. An off-menu Steak Tartar arrived, also prepared to absolute perfection. Be warned, the price will reflect the quality of the dishes ingredients. 

The wine list could get you into big trouble if that's your bag. 
All in all a very good meal with great location and atmosphere. 

Some of the other reviews here based on clientele and cost are misleading, or unfair in my opinion. You are eating in the middle of the banking district of a large city, at a swank upscale a la carte restaurant run by a celebrity chef, and you are upset you are surrounded by bankers and their model-esque dates? Perhaps I am the typical dumb american, but what crowd should I expect at that location? starving artists and nuns? And I saw that 35 dollar burger across from my 50 dollar steak, and it looked damn good. Give this place a try, we all enjoyed it thoroughly."}
{"text":"What a great summer patio. This restaurant is beautiful -- and quite large. I didn't notice the downstairs until I used to the washroom.

Decided to make a spontaneous pop in on Friday for lunch. Pretty quiet as it was around 1pm. We were sat relatively quickly but in terms of service, everything went downhill from there. After Diner En Blanc the night before, I needed bottles after bottles of Perrier. Unfortunately even after the craziest stare down our waitress was more interested in chatting with the bartender than doing her job. 

In terms of food, you won't be disappointed. I had the pickerel with a really nice tomatillo sauce. It was sooo tasty. 

If you're looking for a quick hour lunch spot - this won't be your place but if you have the time, patience and a desire for delish food; sign yourself up!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with family and friends in a Private room (7 adults and 2 little ones). Service was phenomenal!!! Our server was really cute and patient, also lovely to little kids!!! 

Kids menu was ordered ahead of time when we reserved the room. The rest of us ordered 5 starters to share. My favourites would have to be the Roasted Beet and Kale Salad, Duck Liver Pâte, and Beef Tartare. Lobster Poutine and Shrimp Tacos didn't quite stand out to me. For the main course, I ordered the Duck Breast and Sausage. I have to say the sides of the dish stood out to me more. The Brussel sprouts and cauliflower was roasted and charred to perfection. The Duck breast was a little hard to chew, sausage a little dry, however they were flavoured very nicely. The entire table also ordered the Wagyu Striploin and a bottle of wine to share. Sommelier made a very good recommendation that everyone was happy about. 

As for desert, I was too full to try any but they looked pretty good!"}
{"text":"Had the organic salmon. Delicious ! The garnishing that came along with the dish was a little disappointing. I found it to be too busy. Additionally, having pomegranate combined with the other ingredients makes for a colourful and attractive presentation, but having to becareful of fish bones (which there was one - no complaints here as this is normal for fish) and pomegranate seeds makes for a complicated meal (especially when trying to have a conversation). 

As usual, love their food, great staff and very enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bymark have always been one of my favourite spots in terms of ambiance, location and food. I came here last night for Winterlicious, I find the hamachi sashimi lacks flavour. I didn't really enjoy it. The texture of the roasted duck was a bit tough. The chocolate mousse tart tasted pretty good. It was the best out of the three course. I think over all the quality went down. It wasn't as good as it used to be.."}
{"text":"A last minute summerlicious lunch and it was..Okay. Don't get me wrong, the location was superb, the ambience, and even the look of their bathroom. My only downfall fall to the experience was that I called in twice, once the night before and once the day of, to see if there were any availability for 2. They repeatedly stuck to their guns and said they were fully packed. I managed to be in the area at the time and wanted to see what my odds were to be seated as a walk in. While I approached the hostess stand, I looked to my left and all I saw were 2 rows of empty 4 tops!! What kind of \"packed\" house was that? I'm sure they saw the look on my face and said yes they had space available however they gave me a time limit and we had to leave by 1:30pm due to the \"next reservation\" slot. Any who, while being seated, we were at a corner open booth and boy was it hard to weave around. There is hardly any space to get to the other side of the table and I had to get out of my seat once my accompanying guest had to leave the table. Not to mention, the chair makes a loud noise when dragged over even just a nudge to let the other person out. Oh ya, even the servers had trouble with the space because they dropped a knife on me when clearing the table next to ours! Sigh, I am regretting the tip I gave the more I talk about my experience. Knowing that we were on a time restriction, we ordered our food at the same time the water was served to us. We received our apps the soup I didn't expect to be cold but the salmon poke was the bomb. While gobbling our apps, my guest wonders where the complimentary bread is at... I figured summerlicious may not even offer bread baskets due to a 3 course meal at a set price. My guest calls over one of the servers and asks for bread and he genuinely apologizes for forgetting us; but we only received it after our apps were completed. Awkward timing. About 15 minutes pass by and we haven't received our mains. I glance to my left and look down the row and notice 3 other groups of 2 haven't received their mains either. AND THEY WERE THERE BEFORE WE WERE. I wonder if service is their low point. Finally food arrives and my dish with the braised beef cheek pasta is the SIZE OF MY HAND. Note...my hand is super small. I was getting annoyed at this point but since I had a long morning I didn't care to do anything about it. Our time was slipping away and it was 1:15pm. Time for dessert. I had to follow up where our dessert was since we were on a time crunch and out of our row, we received it first. But I guess it's because they wanted us out by 130. The dessert we had to rush but it sure was tasty especially the ice cream Swiss roll. While I call for the bill, the hostess who seated us came to clear our plates..could she make it any more obvious she just wanted to check if we were done on timr. Long story short overall food was average, service was average, therefore my rating is average."}
{"text":"Despite one of our guests arriving 30 minutes later than the reservation time (he got lost), we were still treated very well by the servers. I never got the hint that we were being treated worse because we were Summerlicious participants as I have heard this sometimes happens with other restaurants. The food came in a timely manner, was well-portioned, and was delicious throughout. There were unique items picked for the Summerlicious menu and they were all fantastic. I especially loved the steak option in the entree though I didn't order it myself. It was extremely succulent and it was quite a sufficient portion size, which is something you sometimes worry about with these higher end restaurants. If I had the option to sit on the patio outside, I would have loved to. It is absolutely gorgeous and right in the middle of the TD towers. The interior was still beautiful though so I did not mind at all. Overall, a fantastic experience and a great introduction to a lovely restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I wished Yelp had a 3.5 star system. 

Why the three stars? Nice decor, presentation, and service- the usual standards for a fine dining establishment. Food's not too shabby.

Why the half star and point of redemption? THE BREAD. It is so good that the management decided it was worthy of hiring someone (who I lovingly refer to as...the bread fairy) to specifically walk around and hand out bread. Freshly baked, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, bread. You're doing something right by me, Bymark."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere get the lobster to poutine. Great spot befor the game and after work"}
{"text":"Must try the shrimp taco appetizer. Simply the best single bite of food I have had all year so far. Been to ByMark a few times for lunch. Always excellent food and great service to match. My lunch mate found his $38 burger under cooked but the servers handled it professionally and brought out extra hot fries for him to munch on while he waited. A nice place for a business lunch and a special occasion dinner. Prices are high but the value is there."}
{"text":"Lobster Poutine - A++
Oyster mushrooms - A+
Risotto - A
Steak - C- (order it a little under what you normally like. I ordered med-well and ended up w filet-jerky)"}
{"text":"Bymark is a modern, elegant, and tasty restaurant to visit.

At reception, I found the employees to be a bit snotty.. but the experience elevated with excellent service in the dinning room. I would strongly recommend their lamb dish!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this more than 3 stars but the crap service prevents this restaurant  from being the superstar it wants to be. 

Went there early December on a Saturday night with a girlfriend for a special occasion. Reception was average - they found our reservation and seated us promptly. Despite me stating in the booking it was a special occasion, we never felt that we were given a chance to celebrate. For a Saturday night this place was dead. I could literally hear the ghosts bumping into the walls. On top of that, I'm pretty sure we were the youngest ladies in there but I digress.

Our server was a not so friendly woman with a tongue stud. Nothing against expressing your individuality but just thought it seemed a little out of place in that environment. On top of that, we wouldn't have cared had she tried to spark a little conversation with us! Like Jesus, if I'm going to shell out $$$$ for food and drinks at your establishment can you at least ask me how my food is? On top of that bread service was slow. When I asked for another piece I never got it.

The saving grace of this restaurant is it's food and boy does it need some saving.

We had planned on going all out but after sampling a bunch of apps were stuffed to the gills. We had:

House Cured Gravalax With Warm Sweet Potato Pancakes - delishhhh
Chopped Steak Sliders (off the menu) - so amazing melted in our mouths, we actually ordered extras they were so goooooooooood
Lobster & Brie Grilled Cheese - again off the menu and also very yummy but extremely heavy, I could barely make it through a quarter of the sandwich

We ended with the Mexican Churros and frowns on our faces.

Oh well"}
{"text":"A great experience from start to finish!   Great service started with the very polite hostess who greeted us by name!   The food and atmosphere/ambiance was superb.   Food not only tasted great but it's presentation was very creative.   Not sure what else I can say but I will be back.... Very soon!"}
{"text":"Bymark is located in an uppity part of downtown Toronto with both a basement level dining and a outdoor terrace area. I had the Summerlicious menu for $45 which includes 3 courses: appetizer, main, and dessert. I also paired it with a red wine which is around ~$11.

Ambience and decor is upscale and modern that is both business and date friendly. It could have been more lively inside though with some music or other decor. 

The service was good but not exceptional. I was promptly seated on a Tuesday night. I like it when the staff can make recommendations without me having to ask too much. I only found out about the Summerlicious menu by accident. 

Overall, great food. 

Bread: Ciabatta: really good fresh, warm bread 

Appetizer: Beef Carpaccio (4/5): raw beef with some pickled greens; tasty but nothing special

Main: BBQ Duck Confit with Seared Scallops, Sweet Peas, Mushroom (4/5): The duck and scallops were cooked perfectly but the combination of all the ingredients was a bit confusing with all the different flavors. Duck was exquisitely roasted with nice crispy, fatty pieces.   

Dessert: Double Chocolate Cake with Minted White Chocolate Mousse (5/5): Amazing, stupendous! One of the best desserts I have ever had. If you love chocolate cake, this is for you! The cake was perfect moist with very rich cocoa sauce. Perfect combo with the mint chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"Lunch with a colleague on the patio...weather was fabulous and though we didn't have a reservation for the patio, they were quite accommodating and seated us at the last hightop they had left.  

I ordered the herb crusted, grilled tuna and my colleague had the ravioli.  Both dishes were delicious and beautifully presented...I would have taken a photo, but I didn't want to look ridiculous since it was a business lunch.  Take my word for it, the food looks incredible on the plate.

The grilled tuna was cooked perfectly and served with delicious yellow beans, radish and grainy mustard...yum!

The food was kinda pricey, but in the particular instance I didn't mind at all since it tasted as delicious as it looked.  

Overall, food is delicious, patio is nice, service is good...price is a bit high.  It won't stop me from going back though."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! I loved everything.  It would have been 5 stars if the waiter didn't suck. She didn't come around alot and we waited at least 15 minutes even to order our drinks. Other than that,  delish!!! I had the calamari and a grilled fish that was amazing."}
{"text":"Winterlicious at Bymark does not disappoint.
Bymark's lunch Winterlicious menu showcased 3 appies, 3 main and 3 dessert.  Happy with my selection as per below.
Bread was offered - Multi grain or bagette - piping hot and fresh.
Parsnip soup with spotted prawn - winter soup style nicely accented by chilli pepper and grapefruit. Not spotted prawn season but still nice.  
Bymark burger - Wow.  This was one of the best burger I have had in a long time. Patty cooked to Medium as ordered. The chutney nicely accentuated the meat and the use of black pepper was well controlled.
Pumpkin spice pie with ice cream - made in a Terrine mould. Sprinkled with Toffee brittle. Nice finish indeed.
Food was an overall 4+++."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here for the summerlicious dinner and we think this dinner experience was superb!

Actually it was my second time coming back to this restaurant. I decided to come back since it has a nice menu and I know it won't disappoint me nor my friend.

Even though the price was bit high ($45/person), but the portion was big and the food was delicious! Overall the dinning experience was amazing and I think I would come back again next year again!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and a semi casual place to dine. Some highlights:
the risotto and mushroom dish, the golden perogies, and the tuna tartar.

I also tried the whitefish entree and it was just ok. ( i think pairing it with black lentils is a mistake). The mashed potato side is also just ok. Solid place."}
{"text":"Today my coworker and I wanted to celebrate a milestone for the company we started  and decided to head to Bymark.  The main seating area was booked solid and we were told to head upstairs to the bar, which was largely empty.

We were looking for a comfortable area to situate ourselves and noticed empty seating in the corner and my business partner started heading over in that direction, when he was rudely interrupted by a blonde bartender who scowled, \"where do you think you're going!?\".  She then proceeded to harshly tell us that the space was reserved for six people (an obvious lie since there are no reservations in this area and another server had told us that a lot of people weren't coming in today because of the weather) 

It was such an incredibly rude and off-putting gesture that we both decided to leave immediately, in complete disgust.  We were looking to treat ourselves to the first of hopefully many celebratory meals, and will now never return to Bymark because of this horrible experience."}
{"text":"I really like Bymark - the food is tasty, in fact, I've never had anything I didn't like.  I was at an event here, with tasty appetizers, but their burgers are delish, and totally worth having."}
{"text":"Food was decent, atmosphere was nice, but service was absolutely terrible. I had ordered the porkchops and the meat was very tough and hard to chew. Only the edge was tasty, but the center was dry and tasteless. Also I was given an utter knife to cut my porkchop which obviously didn't cut since the meat was so tough. I had to ask for another knife. Also our food was not served by our waiter, I had to try to flag down someone for fresh ground pepper and by the time that happened, my soup was cold. Also, everyone had an issue with my winter jacket..... our waiter asked to coat check it, I said no because I was wearing an expensive jacket and did not want it stolen or ruined. They had asked that the jacket not be put on the bench but behind the seat (okay, that's a reasonable ask). However she tried to take my jacket for me and hang it on my chair. I said I got it. She tried to pull my jacket out of my hands. Anyway I hung my jacket on the back of my chair like she had asked. Minutes later the manager came and asked if he could coat check my jacket because it was taking up space in the walkway!! Again I declined the request but I moved my chair in. Since then every waiter that walked me kicked my chair. I sat uncomfortably the entire hour having my chair kicked by all the waiters."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to Bymark. Tried winterlicious lunch sat at the booth with a really nice dome shaped roof. Beautiful ambience and loved the presentation of the food. 

The food was great but the salmon was a little bit cold/over cooked. The service was good."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Quick, friendly service. Nice intimate atmosphere.
The pasta was slightly oily.  I had an appetizer with olives, then a main with lots of olives (didn't notice it on the menu).  I was olive'd out by the end.  The mushrooms were delicious.
The avocado martini didn't taste like avocado... i'd probably settle with a rye and ginger next time."}
{"text":"My hamburger there was nothing short of extraordinary.
Service was friendly and with a smile.
Decor/ambiance is always chic and clean there.
The Mexican churros there are out of the world as well.
Friend's had: fish on lentils, strip loin steak, brussel sprouts, roasted beets, roasted rapini, shrimp \"tacos\" on beet chips - which are also out of this world, and the special of the day which was mushroom risotto.  All were excellent except the risotto was overly salted.  To the point where an IV of water needed to be used on my poor friend who ate an entree portion of it.
Will always go back there.  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Went for summerlicious. The food was tasty with a lot of flavour. I enjoyed the deconstructed strawberry shortcake dessert.

Their mixed berry juice was amazing but would have been perfect with some alcohol :).

Service was incredibly great compared to other high end restaurants I've been to.

I would love to come try their regular menu.
Only thing I disliked was the dark lighting in the inside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in this city for quite a few reasons. 
1. Location is so convenient right in the middle of financial district
2. The decor and atmosphere is excellent
3. Food is amazing what else would you expect from the best restauranteur this city has to offer
4. Service is amazing 
I have never had a bad meal or bad service at Bymark 
I also love the way this restaurant is situated too if you don't know exactly where it is you might have to go around the block once or twice."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for fancy dinner. I love their wine collection. It's amazing. I came here for winterlicious ( 1st time ever). This place meets my high expectation. I got duck breast as main dish. Medium rare, soft amd clean smell mix with beet sauce. The dish is combination or savoury and little bit of sweet touch. I recommend the apple crepe. Thin layer wrap around sour apple, top by sweet apple sauce and apple pie crumble! I'm a huge fan of dessert. I also recommend lobster poutine. Fresh lobster with lime-ish lobster sauce. They have coat check, another nice touch to fancy up the place."}
{"text":"Very upsetting! We made reservations for our anniversary dinner for last night, only to arrive at a closed restaurant. We called the day before to make the reservations and confirmed that it was for the next day."}
{"text":"Bymark is one of my favourite upscale restaurants in Toronto that never disappoints in delivering the best quality food and service. The restaurant has two floors that separates the dining area from the bar which helps to accommodate diners who want a relaxed and quiet ambiance while they enjoy their dinner. Upstairs in the bar is filled with leather seats and is surrounded by large windows throughout the place which gives it a classy, yet comfortable atmosphere. From both the bar and dining area, the servers are very kind and accommodating, and they make sure all the guests are having an enjoyable dining experience. 

One of my personal favourites from Bymark's bar menu is their New Zealand Lamb Rack ($21) which is a great shareable item for two. The lamb rack is a must have because it doesn't have any gamey taste, which most lambs do at many restaurants, and the meat is very tender and seasoned to perfection. From their dinner menu, I really like their 10 oz. Angus Striploin ($43) which comes out perfectly cooked to your liking and is very tender and juicy. Personally, Bymark is one of my favourite restaurants for steak. If you're looking for a delicious side, you should order their Lobster Poutine ($18), which can also be ordered as a starter ($28). The poutine comes with large pieces of fresh lobster meat topped with a classic Bearnaise sauce which brings all the flavours together beautifully.

I highly recommend Bymark if you're looking for an upscale restaurant with delicious food and a relaxed ambiance."}
{"text":"McEvan Bymark is a very average restaurant.  It is very fusion, out of the world expectation.  Too fusion that I cannot too accept.  The crab cake appetizer is good, but the main is too fusion.  We have the pasta with snow pea, and the other main is scallop with shrimp wonton. I think I am eating Chinese food in a high end restaurant, with a high end price.  Everything is average to me, nothing too memorable, except the decor.  I would not too recommend ByMark."}
{"text":"Recently came here for a Winterlicious lunch and was impressed by the food and service. One of our guests were late, but they quickly brought out his appetizer and got his main dish out with the rest of ours. Look forward to trying their regular menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful trendy atmosphere, and accessible via the underground PATH. I came here on a Christmas lunch for work, and was really impressed by the prompt and attentive service and swanky atmosphere. This is a great spot to meet co-workers during the day, meet friends or acquaintances for after-work drinks, or even to meet an evening dinner date (there's always something very date-ish about dim lighting). This isn't a bad spot to drop by for cocktail hour either (to people-watch the suits, if you're into that...)

For lunch, I had the tuna sashimi and steak tartare as starters to share, and the grilled Korean chicken as a main. The starters were quite decent (I'd recommend the steak tartare - super fresh, and melts in your mouth). The grilled Korean chicken was average - while the chicken wasn't rubbery, it wasn't as tender as I'd hoped it would be. Go for the starters - they won't do you wrong. Drinks were served promptly and were absolutely delicious - the \"Some Like It Hot\" tasted like juice (dangerous, I know).

Overall, a super delicious meal in a lovely, stylish setting. While it isn't my first choice for food, it's a great atmosphere for drinks and appetizers/small plates. 

3 stars for food, 4 stars for atmosphere."}
{"text":"Judging from all the other reviews, a couple of friends and I had great interest in trying out this restaurant in the heart of the Financial District. It was Summerlicious, so we naturally picked the prefix menu that was offered. The service was pleasant and high end. But to my great surprise, the food was incredibly bland and tasteless. I went for the tagliatelle with braised lamb. For such a dish that requires long cooking times and braising, it lacked even the slightest of flavours. The pasta was bland (almost as if it wasn't even cooked in salted water to begin with), and the only saving grace for any hint of flavour was the cheese mouse on top. I'd have to say it was the most disappointing Summerlicious restaurant by far, and I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I tried Bymark during Winterlicious this year. We made a reservation about a week in advance because we thought it would be busy. To our surprise it wasn't, which was nice. The restaurant was about half full that night.

Bymark might be little hard to find if you don't know where it is. We could have very easily taken a wrong turn in the PATH and they don't have very good signage on street level.

The service we received that night was amazing. In my fiancee's words: \"We haven't been to a place where everyone knows what they are doing\". We were offered a complementary coat check when we arrived, and promptly seated.

We ordered from the Winterlicious prix fixe menu, and we both had a wine that was suggested on the menu. Everything that we ate definitely left an impression on us. Even writing this review more than a month and a half after our visit, I can still remember the taste of the food. I had a the beef tartare, duck breast main, and gingerbread cake for dessert. My fiancee had the burrata appetizer, grilled branzino & mussels main, and apple crepes for dessert.

Our bill came to around $150 after tax and tip."}
{"text":"Best food and service I have had in my life, or for as long as I can remember right now lol. 
The server was amazing, he left us alone when he should have and came to the table seemingly just when he was needed. 

The lobster poutine might be the best thing I have ever tasted, at first I couldn't believe the price of it.. but then I tasted it and I understood. I could eat that every day of my life and be happy.

I had the lamb loin for dinner and the portion was very big, which is very uncommon for higher end restaurants. You know how it usually goes, you pay tons of money for two bites of food that look pretty on a plate. This definitely was not the case at Bymark. I wasn't sure how I was going to finish it but it was so yummy that I had to do it somehow. 

My boyfriend had the burger and said it was delicious, the best burger he has ever eaten.

The Oysters were very fresh and also great! 

We didn't have desert because we were way too full, next time!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here.

I had a THIRTY EIGHT DOLLAR HAMBURGER.

Was it good?   Sure.  But shouldn't it be?

Some simple hamburger math for you.   Let's say you like...I dunno... your standard greasy spoon hamburger.   Let's say that it costs $2.    You could have a burger a week for... um...   OVER FOUR COMPLETE MONTHS for the same price.    That's not to say that it's not good....  :)"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for winterlicous, and I had heard from multiple sources that this restaurant has the best steak in the city. I was kind of let down."}
{"text":"This was my second Winterlicious of the year and I cannot rave enough about it.  I'd go as far as to say it's my favourite Winterlicious/Summerlicious in the past few years.. it was just that good.

Truly, I do believe you get what you pay for and Bymark overshot my expectations by miles.  

The inside of the resto is elegantly dim.  Everything about this Mark McEwan resto says class and the dining experience is definitely enhanced by the beautiful ambiance.

We started off with a glass of chardonnay and malbec.  The servers were extremely friendly and attentive, offered helpful recommendations and were extremely personable.  I even liked the bread that they served... I was so put off by a medicore Winterlicious lunch I had earlier in the day before I started off my meal but sitting down in the resto just dispelled all of that.

FOOD
Apps
Crudo of Albacore Tuna
-winter citrus, granny smith apple & fried sunchoke chips.  
Who is this culinary genius that thought of putting grapefruit and other varieties of winter citrus with tuna?  This was absolutely DELICIOUS.  I really expected this to be a standard tuna app, one that I'll enjoy but not think anything special of it.  How wrong I was, the tuna was alright by itself - medium (though I prefer rare being a sushi fan) - but coupled with the red peppers and fruit varieties daintily placed on the plate, I was sold.  The fresh seafood with a hint of spice and tangy fruitiness was perfect.

Calamari & Salt Spring Mussels
-warm white beans, pan stewed tomatoes & cracked olives
This was alright... I suppose it's hard to make mussels and calamari taste mindblowingly good unless we're talking Spanish, but it was still not bad and tasted fairly fresh.

Mains
Grilled Sea Bream
-side striped shrimp, mussels, beluga lentils, lime yogurt & cracked olive tapenade
I had beef for lunch that day, so I decided to get seafood for my own main.  When it first arrived, my first instinct was disappointment because the dish was not exactly visually appealing.  The sea bream was dark and a bit charcoaled, there was what looked like white cream underneath and I thought to myself wth did I just order.. let me trade with that delicious looking striploin on the other side of me right now.
.........clearly I was being an unappreciative prick because goddamn this was some good fish.  
a) This thing we call beluga lentils (almost bean-like) is black magic and goes well with this mystical sea bream I had to wiki after b) Lime yogurt should be eaten with every type of fish there is because the combination was incredible.
I cleaned my plate except the my food enemy named olives.  But the dish was so good I even considered eating those too.

Duo of Beef
center cut striploin, braised veal cheeks, roasted squash & Yorkshire pudding
The striploin did not taste like mass-produced Winterlicious items that other restos offer.  It was juicy and tender, a perfect medium rare that we asked for.  ...my appetite was so good after the delicious sea bream that I could've probably finished the striploin too.  The braised veal cheeks were ok; soft, flavourful, but overshadowed by the striploin.  A+ beef dish compared to the Trios disaster I had earlier in the day.

Dessert
Fruit Crumble
oat crunch, puff pastry cookie
I didn't go adventurous with the dessert b/c a) no such option and b) 5 starts already earned from a fantastic app and main.  The crumble was still tasty though; the oat crunch was so satisfying and helped balance out the very sweet raspberry.  Not a fan of the pastry cookie because it had too much sugar coating, but pretty good dessert :)

Banana Coffee Cake
espresso syrup, brandy snap, chocolate ice cream & banana nut praline
Loved the ice cream and the brandy snap with this banana coffee cake.  Standard cake, a bit too doughy but still quite delicious!

And so, I left Bymark a happier foodie."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with 4 of my co-workers. We were seated promptly. The service was quick despite how busy it was.  We came for the Winterlicious menu.

For starters I had the Celery root puree with chicken confit, crisp skin, salted pistachio brittle & sage. This was the best course hands down. I was afraid when they submerged the crispy skin into the puree that it would get soggy. But surprisingly that wasn't the case. Even the sage was crispy. I enjoyed every component of this dish.

For the main I tried the Organic Trout with crispy artichokes, arugula, caramelized cipollinis & dill buttermilk dressing.  The fish was perfectly cooked. My only let down was the skin not being crispy. That maybe a matter of personal taste. I really liked the crispy artichokes. Also I felt like it wasn't a cohesive dish. It was missing something that could bring it all together. 

For dessert I had the Honey Bourbon Sage Crème Brulee and whipped shortbread cookies. The shortbread cookie sat on top of some sort of berry jam. That jam was easily the best thing on the plate. I didn't get much of a bourbon flavor which I was looking for. I was disappointed that it was falsely advertised but it was damn good Crème brulee. 

I had high expectations going in and for the most part my expectations were met. My friends were also impressed with the service and food. I would definitely recommend bymark."}
{"text":"OK. Bymark has a beautiful outdoor patio bar in the center of the financial district. So, I should have know what I was getting myself into.

But only come here if you can stomach the doucheberry-toting, blue-suited bankers and the generically vapid females they're trying to sc*re with. Because they ruin the ambiance of that great patio. Completely.

The food is quite good, but even for what it is, it's very overpriced. My steak was tender but came out overcooked (it was ordered medium rare, which is also chef's choice).

I do have to say that the service is excellent.

But I could never again let a night out with my friends and a $500 meal be soiled by the creepy clientele."}
{"text":"Was on a business trip to Toronto and came here with a few co-workers for dinner. The restaurant is downstairs and a bar with some outdoor seating upstairs. First impression of the bar: trendy with a lot of suits and business attire. Good scene.

Got seated right away because we had a reservation. Highly recommend reservation. It did get crowded real quickly. Hostess was pleasant, server was nice. Wasn't as attentive as some of the other reviewers posted, but I wouldn't say it was \"bad\" service. 

Started with some wine, drinks, oysters, shrimp tacos, soups and Italian sausages. Portions are small as one would expect in a pricey restaurant. Warning, the shrimp tacos are very very small. I mean tiny, but they were quite good. Food was fresh and good. For the entrees, we ordered the surf n turf, the special which was a hand made penne pasta with lobster, the stuffed tortellini. No complaints from the table. When the food came, we were pretty much silent as we were enjoying the food.

We ended the night with a few drinks upstairs. 

The place has a good vibe, food is good, staff responsive but it is quite pricey. With drinks, appetizers, main, and a dessert, expect to pay well over $100 per person."}
{"text":"Going to Bymark is enjoyable and this visit was not any different. I enjoyed dining at Bymark.

Bymark's atmosphere is unique, classy (normally) and romantic (usually). The food is always good and the service is polite.

This visit was imperfect, but it is not because of the management or the kitchen.
Firstly, the menu has hardly changed over the years, which I appreciate. The classics they serve are still good and still reliable. The high quality remains. They used to serve bread for customers, but that was absent this visit. We had gravlax salmon as appetizers, which came with guacamole and cherry tomatoes. I had the venison loin done medium and found it tasty and liked the pepper crusted edges. My friend enjoyed the fish too. As with most restaurants the Japanese influence has well crept in and Bymark now serves \"hamachi\" and yuzu ice cream! The only thing wrong with the creme brulee is that I wish there was more of it.

Bymark offers a lounge upstairs and a dining room downstairs and we were sitting downstairs. The waitress was polite. The hostess was sweet. They had a group sitting at the far end near the entrance who had a crying baby in tow. I was just grateful I was not on an aeroplane. Moreover, Bymark had wisely placed the group as far from the rest of the diners as possible. An East Asian family, however, were seated next to us and they were hilarious. They were famished and talking it up in Chinese. It was so loud I believe the entire (normally quiet) restaurant could hear their loud chatter. They had large group bowl after bowl of food and more food and were declaring its glory to everybody. I am sure most patrons did not appreciate their enthusiasm. I assume the restaurant management enjoyed giving them the bill however. 
Do not be dissuaded. Bymark normally offers a classy and posh setting.
For high-end Canadian food Bymark is a very good destination and a favourite."}
{"text":"Impossibly delightful from beginning to end.  Unpretentious service, delicious food (72 hour short rib & lobster!), nice pace.  Hostess Marissa was a breath of fresh air--bubbly but professional.  Our server Andrew was lovely.  He was there but not overbearing.  Left us to our business dinner but interjected when needed.  Great recommendations he gave--Lobster poutine, shrimp tacos!  We were never pushed or hurried even though we were the last to leave.  Andrew even fished my credit card out of my coat checked pocket when time for payment.  Will be back fo' sho'."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Bymark, by way of Winterlicious 2013. The cost was $45 for a prix-fixe dinner menu.

The food was great, overall. For appetizers, we had the lamb sausage and cured gravlax. The sausage was excellent, but I was disappointed in the small portion (3 smallish bites). I wasn't a fan of the gravlax, but it's rare that I enjoy fish. My girlfriend likes fish, but she thought it was excessively salty. Everything else on these plates was delicious.

My Chicken Demi-Deuil was very good, although perhaps slightly dry on the outside. The cobia filet was quite tasty, even for me. The desserts were a let-down, however. The pear panna cotta was rather bland and uninteresting. The pumpkin spice cake was fine, but it seemed like standard grocery-store fare.

Service was outstanding.

My biggest problem with Bymark is simply the price. Our cocktails jacked up the bill substantially at $15 a piece. To be fair, they were both excellent. Adding coffee and cappucino, the bill came to nearly $150 with tax, before gratuity. I knew going in that my wallet was going to take a good beating, but I don't feel that the prices are justified.

Pet peeve: the restaurant doesn't accept payment by debit card. Why the hell is that? It's not the end of the world, but I should be able to pay however I prefer.

3 1/2 out of 5."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic night here. 
Atmosphere: the lighting and table setting make people feel relaxed. 

Service: they are very friendly and always available 

Food: 
Starting: we had a freshly baked bread to start 
Both Caesar salad and shrimp tacos are very delightful, tacos are crunchy with refreshing sauce
Entree: my friend had the lamb loin and I had the P.E.I. Beef tenderloin. Both are well cooked with pleasing taste. 
Dessert: we tried the mixed berry and vanilla bean Cream brûlée. Every ingredients matches perfectly with each other!"}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious 2018 for a somewhat interesting menu. For apps, I got the Hamachj Sashimi compressed pineapple with passion fruit purée, dehydrated smoked chilli and horseradish, and my friends both got the Pork Belly & Shrimp with grits, tomato, hickory sticks and scallions. The hamachi was nicely sliced, good portions (5 pieces) and tasted fresh. I like sashimi with wasabi and soy sauce but with these extra toppings, I didn't really \"get\" how the flavours go together because I didn't enough of it. Too much fish to the toppings, which isn't such a bad thing! I couldn't taste the pineapple with passion fruit, but each component tasted good individually. I didn't get the smoked chilli or horseradish. Might as well been just the hamachi! Could've used salt and acid if I didn't get any wasabi or soy sauce. I tasted some of the pork belly, way too fatty. And the grits were bad, like too mealy. Not even seasoned. 

For mains, we each got different things. I got the grilled Ahi tuna with orzo, sundried tomato, olives, roasted red onions, basil and olive tapenade. My friends got the Roasted Duck Breast (duck confit), squash risotto and braised apple and the venison loin & croquette with roasted carrots, king mushrooms, and Saskatoon berry compote. The tuna was nicely seared and still raw in the middle but it looked like it was sweating when I got it, meaning it must've sat for a bit. Slightly overlooked. The orzo was a bit chewy but well seasoned. The olives and olive tapenade was good by itself but made everything way too salty. The tuna was salty too. Kind of disappointed because I love tuna! The duck confit was alright, not the best I've had but cooked decent. Well seasoned. The venison and croquette was probably the best of the 3 dishes. Venison was cooked nicely and seasoned well. Surprisingly not too gamey as it sometimes tastes. Went well with the berry compote, it cut a lot the gaminess. The croquette was pretty good too, it tasted like venison but ground up and mixed with breadcrumbs and seasoned well too! 

Finally for dessert, we got the Egg nog creme brûlée with spiced shortbread cookies and apple cider donuts with chantilly cream and honeycomb. The creme brûlée was very \"egg nogey\", had that nice sugar crystallization layer you break with your spoon. The creme was tasted and was spiced as well. The shortbread was dry and I didn't taste any spice. Was it bought at a store? The donuts were small like timbits and so dry, not good. Tim Horton's timbits are better!

Overall, the food was just average. For the price $53 for a 3-course meal, not bad considering it's Mark McEwan's restaurant and the location. The presentation for each dish was top notch though. The menu sounded interesting but was not very executed well. The service was slow too. I felt like the time between each dish was like 20 min. That's way too long. And there were not even free bread to start! Other fine dining restaurants at least have free bread. Come on Mark! Don't be a cheap ass! My friend also got the mixed fruit cocktail. It looked like it was juiced to order because it had the foam that comes with after juiced. She said it was sour. That info probably should've been on the menu or provided by the waitress. The decor was nice. Each table was nicely spaced out so you can't even hear your neighbour's conversation. Lighted dark so it's romantic. They validate your parking so that's a bonus."}
{"text":"Had a great summerlicious experience today at bymark! Food was great and were presented well. Ordered the octopus stew, simple chickpea stew with fresh herbs. Octopus could be seasoned and more tender this dish was ok. My entree was the korean pork dish. This pork dish melted in my mouth. You wont need a knife for this pork it was so tender is was so delicious! Unbelievable. I was also able to try the lamb tagliatelle, it had a sour smell too it which was odd, but the flavor of the dish was incredible. Desserts were also good baked alaska was very good so is the tart. 
My only problem was bus boys were taking our plate with out asking if we are done hands are already on the plate its like oh ok... Kinda thing.  For a restaurant at this caliber shouldnt be making this mistake."}
{"text":"this has been my sixth visit to Bymark. I have always been a fan of Mark and his work. Before when we would visit the restaurant it had a vibe of high quality food and service.
But this last time didn't have me feeling that way. drinks were mediocre at best with a high end price tag.
lobster poutine- is always a must."}
{"text":"Bymark never fails to disappoint me. Their striploin is so tender and flavourful. The cod is cooked to perfection and goes really well with the sides. 
Desserts are okay. 
Great customer service and beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary - my wife wanted to eat at a McEwan restaurant since we watch him on FoodTV a lot.

The food was 5 stars, some of the best restaurant meals I have ever eaten.  The preparation, the freshness were truly out of the norm.  Presentation was outstanding, and the service was top quality.  The waitress serving us picked up on the fact it was our anniversary, not sure how, but when they brought us our desert on a shared plate, they had written in chocoloate \"happy anniversary\".  That was the final touch that convinced my wife (a real foodie herself and amazing cook) that this was one of the best meals she had ever experienced.  It was a nice touch by the staff.

The ONLY reason I give it 4 out of 5, is the seating layout in the restaurant.  We had a corner \"booth\" with one of those couch style sitting on one side, and chair on the other.  The couch side is to low, and there was a join between the 2 couch endpoints that made sitting there very uncomfortable.

If you want to go here, and are only 2 of you, insist on a table in the middle of the restaurant, and do not take the side couch style sitting area."}
{"text":"I've been to Bymark a few times and 
their  72 hour beef short ribs is melt in your mouth deliciousness!
Their mushroom truffle risotto has ruined me for all other risottos.  Whenever I order a risotto from other restaurants, it just doesn't compare...so now, to avoid disappointment, I don't order the risotto from other restaurants anymore  
Their classic shrimp tacos arso refreshing and tasty!"}
{"text":"The summerlicious lunch was exceptional! The cuisine is distinctly Canadian, but with international influences. Beautiful presentation, but the food was amazing. Poke, a traditional Hawaiian staple was reinvented with a modern twist with the fried rice cake. The seared ahi tuna was coated in a thin layer of cracked black pepper, its delicacy accentuated by the sweet spring peas. One of the best restaurants in the financial district."}
{"text":"Located underground in the heart of downtown Toronto, this place was certainly a hidden surprise. (Not sure if they still do it now, but you get a voucher or something for parking since parking downtown is quite pricey). 

I would definitely come here for their lobster poutine again; it was a rare dish in Toronto and oh so good! A lobster tail is wrapped among a small dome of crisp fries, sauces and cheese... drool. The wild mushrooms in a mini pot dish was also very cute; a good portion for a single person only though. Their steak on the other hand was a bit boring, and dry. Presented lonesomely on a white plate with a single rosemary on top, it almost looked like they were out of garnishes.

Their wine list was quite extensive, which added to the lovely décor of the restaurant.. Wine lovers do give this place a try. If you want a date at a restaurant that offers good food and wine, and a quiet and relaxing atmosphere, add this place to your list. 

Definitely coming here again for their lobster poutine and their wine collection."}
{"text":"Great service and contemporary decoration.  
We went on a Wednesday night for a date night with my boyfriend. The server was very attentive on getting our service.  We ordered the hamachi sashmi as appetizer.  The hamachi was very fresh... The cutting of the sashimi was not topical japanese way; it was not like a western way of cutting.  The fillet was fresh and was very rich since it was the cut from the belly.  The presentation is amazing ... We can say the presentation is actually teastier than the food itself ....lol.  
My course we order herb crusted venison loin and while roasted orata to share.  We'd like to try something different . The chef was able to divid the dish for us... ( not every restaurant will do it)  the venison loin was amazing.  We order as medium rare which is prefect for it ....
The orata has been debone which made it easier to eat ....  The only think I do not like about this restaurant is the service.  The server is knowledgeable and nice but they all seems a bit rush....I have a feeling that they have many table to serve."}
{"text":"See blog for full refiew with pictures in context:

Highlights:

Featuring a unique menu focused strongly on Canadian sourced ingredients and a number of options, both sweet and savory, that seemed to challenge \"the norm\" I contacted Bymark nearly a month before my planned trip and inquired as to whether a tasting menu was available so that I might experience as many dishes as possible.   Fielding my e-mail in less than eight hours restaurant manager Jessica Sloan informed me that while the restaurant did not offer a nightly tasting the chef would be \"delighted\" to craft a menu to my liking if I informed him of which dishes interested me most - an offer I was more than happy to take them up on.  Informing the kitchen of my likes and dislikes I was quoted a price for my selected menu and confirmed my reservation for one at 7:30pm on Saturday evening.

Getting things started, my first dish was an amuse from the kitchen - a Lobster, apple, and crème fraiche \"taco\" served on a beet tortilla.  Featuring an ample amount of fresh lobster accented by sweet gala apples and tamed by the tangy crème this dish was excellent when paired with the crispy and earthy-yet-sweet beet chip.  Small, fun, inventive, and delicious - an excellent way to start things off.

Dish three of the evening was the restaurant's signature - and a dish every bit worth the title.  Crisp frites with butter braised lobster and classic béarnaise - poutine style was actually delivered to my table by the chef du cuisine and featured approximately 20 crisp frites stacked inside a lobster shell and absolutely loaded with butter poached lobster.  Topping the dish was a creamy béarnaise sauce with high notes of lemon and butter plus more nuanced flavors of wine and onion.  Whereas the dressing on the salad mired the flavor of the dish, the béarnaise on this dish only served to accent the wonderful lobster and crispy-salty fries.  Say what you will about \"haute-poutine,\" this dish was wonderful and alone worth the trip to Bymark - though I do wonder whether the average diner could finish a full sized portion as the tasting portion was so decadent.

The fourth dish of the evening was presented quite elegantly by my server and finished tableside.  Entitled duck confit ravioli with chestnut puree, crisp parsnip and spiced cranberries I was served a single plump raviolo absolutely packed with clove and nutmeg accented duck leg and topped with a crispy garnish of fried parsnip.  Served alongside and overtop the pasta was a creamy sweet-yet-earthy chestnut puree plus cinnamon sweetened cranberries with a mild alcoholic tang.  Featuring aspects of protein and carb, sweet and earthy, creamy and acidic this dish was truly excellent and when I saw my neighbor order the full portion (three large ravioli plus all the fixings) I was actually quite impressed at the menu price, as well.

My final savory of the evening was the roasted Cornish Hen with roasted Brussels sprouts, potato gnocchi and natural reduction - it was remarkable.  Perfectly seared and succulent the meaty hen simply shredded off the bone with minimal effort and no knife.  Accompanying the hen were two halved and pan-caramelized Brussels sprouts and two large plump gnocchi that easily gave way to their creamy interiors on mastication - these items as well as the hen were topped with the natural reduction from the hen and sprouts and the whole dish was succulent, salty, and well balanced between creamy and crispy textures as well as pungent and smooth flavors.

When it was all said and done I paid the bill - $120 Canadian and felt the meal was actually a relatively good bargain for the quality of the food, setting, and accommodations by the staff.  While service was adequate I have to say that my server's tongue ring did seem a bit out of place for fine dining and though I certainly can't blame her for my neighbors, I do feel that if she'd have been less involved with their \"issues\" she'd have inquired more frequently as to how I was enjoying everything.  A talented kitchen staff with some unique ideas, I do feel that some dishes were not executed as well as one would expect while other dishes could use some tweaking to more properly highlight the quality of the ingredients and the chef's vision - particularly the cinnamon bun tower and the octopus salad.  That said - I'd return in a heartbeat for the poutine, the foie, and the ravioli."}
{"text":"Visited Bymark for lunch with a group from work. Weather was beautiful so we were seated on the patio. 

I ordered the famous Bymark Burger, which was of excellent quality. The 8-ounce patty did however, slightly overpower the truffle, mushrooms and brie. At $38, it was definitely one of the better burgers I've had, though Richmond Station's burger ($21) remains my number one. 

Overall, excellent service and great ambiance."}
{"text":"I had their lobster poutine here. Back when work was path accessible I find myself at this restaurant on special occasions. It was neat t see my favourite show suits being filmed there when the south of temperance was torn down."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: If it's the cost of menu (or the Visa Black Card that you'll need to whip out to pay for it - www.blackcard.com to see what I mean) that will impress your client / date, you've come to the right place; otherwise, the food will leave you wanting.

I lunched here to celebrate my friend (finally) quitting his soul sucking corporate law job just minutes beforehand. His new-found freedom may have, quite possibly, been the freshest thing in the resto. :P

We started off with the duck confit poutine and their infamous shrimp tacos before moving on to their slow roasted beef brisket sandwich and the $35 burger. A couple of Guinnesses later, we were feeling pretty good! 

Broadly speaking, while nothing was poorly made, neither was it particularly memorable nor impressive. It lacked the \"wow\" factor that would tempt me to return. Sadly, I wouldn't consider their burger, while finely made, to be top 5 in the city.

The service was fair - I didn't get any of the snooty attitude that other Yelpers have noted, but I suppose it didn't hurt to be dining with a former corporate lawyer still in his 3-piece suit. If you ever find yourself becoming an ex-corporate lawyer, hit me up and lunch'll be on me, though I'll be taking you elsewhere."}
{"text":"Visited Bymark for lunch and my group was seated inside in the \"upstairs\" section of the restaurant.  The environment was relaxed and had a very lounge feel to it - we were seated  in low couches which was a nice change to the standard table and chair atmosphere.  I know they also have a downstairs dining area where it's a little more formal.  Our waitress was friendly, efficient and not overly attentive (which is a big pet peeve of mine when they hover).   I had the Bymark burger and it was great - although I think anything with enough truffle oil in it would taste good.  The burger was cooked medium rare as requested and the fries that came with it were crispy and delicious.  
The service was good, and the food came out quickly, an ideal combination for a good sit down lunch."}
{"text":"Coming in with a group of 5, and having an open table type of ordering (we all had shared appetizers) I was able to try the octopus, spare ribs, the grape dish, duck with orange gelée, and the breads. ALL of them phenomenal. For the main course I had the striploin, and bone marrow, it was to die for. The wait staff was excellent, I noticed other reviews stated they were slow, but our waitress always appeared close by, but observed the flow of our eating and only came by as needed. It was perfect by my standards."}
{"text":"While this restaurant in only a short walk in the PATH from my office, it is not a restaurant I frequent. Came here as part of Summerlicious so will comment on the menu related to it....

Had the Steak which was amazing, but what I would expect from a McEwan restaurant. The melon salad was very posh, but with that said it was excellent. Finally, the dessert which I can't even remember, had different types of berry mousses and was super delicious!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I don't think of this as a \"destination\" restaurant but maybe that's because I work half a block away and have been here a few times for drinks/lunch/dinner. (Don't get me wrong; I'm not at all a high-roller on a first-name basis here -- my point being that I probably don't give Bymark its full due.)

I haven't eaten or drank anything here I didn't like. Solid Financial District fare -- nothing complicated, just well-executed with a twist. Not as ambitious as Canoe, but cooler and more comfortable.

Waaaaaaay better than McEwan's ONE Restaurant up in Yorkville. It's like night and day."}
{"text":"The service is really well maintained and the ambiance is typical.  Yes a wee bit pretentious but the food is delishly tasty.  Respect for Mark McEwan's vision here..this place never disappoints on the food front"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to bymark for my birthday, I had been hearing good things and so had been looking forward to a Mark McEwan staple.  I had tried North 44 with a groupon a few years ago, the octopus was delicious but everything else was good, but not spectacular. 

On this experience, we sat on the patio on a warm June evening, in the financial district, surrounded by suits and reality show looking wives. We mulled over the menu, and decided, for appetizers, would order the Lobster Poutine with béarnaise sauce, and the shaved foie gras on brioche.  For dinner, my BF ordered the ricotta ravioli and I ordered the duck with potato Mille feuille. 

The Butter Braised Lobster Poutine - at $28 was delicious, as it should be in theory, cus how can you go wrong with buttery lobster over fried frites, smothered with a classic buttery sauce. The lobster was tender and portions of the crustacean was pretty adequate.  

The Shaved Foie Gras Torchon - at $28, to us, was a disappointment. We prefer our foie seared, the bouncy flavorful morsel melting in my mouth. But, we can't say no to foie, so we ordered it, not really know what to expect. I'm not sure how much foie you actual get at its a light, airy mound, it was tasty, but I'm not sure if I actually consumed it, or perhaps the wind just blew it away. 

My boyfriend, who hates mushrooms, ordered the:
Truffle and spinach ricotta tortellini with tomato sauce and more mushrooms at $29. He's Italian and he loves ravioli, and by the time I looked up he was done his entire bowl, so I'm sure he liked them.

And I had the:
Lightly smoked Duck Breast on top a butter potato Mille feuille, and turnips, carrots, fava beans. The duck was cooked perfectly, everything was flavorful and delicious. 

Overall, I had a good experience.  The food was good, there's nothing bad I can say about it. Was it mind blowing and inventive, no, not really, but it was a good. It's reliable and well executed.  Maybe when you already have a name established you can just coast on the fame, and be safe, but reliable.  I would ideally rate it 3.75 stars, because as it was very good, the price point is high, I feel I have better and/or comparable meals in Montreal and New York for less. But still, a nice experience!"}
{"text":"My rating is actually 3.5 out of 5.

Spent a quiet Monday evening at the bar upstairs with a couple of co-workers.
It's a small but stylish place to grab a drink and a few bites. The prices are high as it's likely geared toward the Bay Street elite but not completely outrageous. Please note that the bar menu is not vegetarian-friendly but they did alter the flatbread to remove the meat."}
{"text":"The seared tuna sashimi was delish! Def worth a try. But the real winner here is the lobster poutine. It's phenomenal but very heavy. Thankfully, they have a half portion available."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and chose the seared tuna sashimi and the tuna and bacon sandwich, paired with the Bynark Sauv Blanc.

Service was impeccable, friendly without being too familiar. Bread came right away and refreshingly only one piece offered, and he was never seen again. At first I was left wanting more but I was glad in the end, as there was a delicious lunch ahead.

The tuna was perfectly seared, my only snipe is that the portions were not evenly sliced.  The seasoned peanuts were very tasty, if somewhat difficult to pick up with a fork.

The sandwich came came with sweet potato fries that were not over salted. The tuna appeared to be the same as for the appy just cut thicker, and the sandwich was awesome - I especially liked the bread.

I even had room for dessert and selected the chef's choice trio; all were delicious! 

Well worth the money in my view. This should be a Michelin starred restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Bymark for last year's Summerlicious, but that didn't deter me from coming back again. Why? Because I immediately noticed that the famous Bymark burger was on their Winterlicious lunch menu! There was a lot of hype around this gourmet burger, priced at a whopping $35 on their regular lunch menu! Personally, I would never pay $35 for a burger, but I didn't mind trying it for $25 when the deal included an appetizer and dessert! 

My boyfriend ordered a fancy version of a caesar salad- Romaine hearts with honey smoked bacon, oven cured tomatoes, reggiano, and caesar vinaigrette. It was lighter than the usual caesar salad and wasn't heavily dressed. 

All the girls, myself included, opted for crispy crab cakes with celery root & apple remoulade. The crab cake was pretty tasty. I would've liked more of that remoulade, for that artistic smear was not nearly enough for two crab cakes. I did, however, very much enjoyed that refreshing vegetable slaw. It had a great crunch and paired well with the fried crab cake. 

Most of us ordered the famous Bymark 8 oz U.S.D.A. Prime Burger with brie de meaux and grilled king mushroom! It was definitely a sizable burger! I was so excited to cut my burger open and see that it came out perfectly rare! The quality of the beef was excellent, and the juicy patty was definitely the star of the burger. In contrast, the toppings were rather lackluster. The cheese and mushroom were nice, but they weren't enough to elevate the burger. Some people might prefer the simplicity to let the beef patty shine, but I was really craving for some sort of sweetness. Perhaps adding caramelized onions would've helped. Overall, I enjoyed this gourmet burger, but I would still never pay $35 for it. I think that there are affordable burgers out there that are comparable to the quality of this one. 

One of my friends ordered the pasta instead- pappardelle and braised rabbit with winter vegetables, tossed in a grainy mustard sauce. I took a few bites from her pasta and I thought that the mustard sauce was delicious. The sweetness of the sauce certainly worked well with the rabbit and the pappardelle. As well, the rabbit was quite tender. This dish would've been a great alternative had I not set my eyes on the burger. 

For dessert, my friends ordered the apple crostata with caramel crunch ice cream. The crostata was like a free-form apple pie, so naturally, it was an immediate hit. The general complaint was that the pastry on the outside was overly dry and thick, but other than that, we all enjoyed the dessert.

My boyfriend opted for an orange Nanaimo brownie with toasted meringue. The two bites that I stole were really, really good! Normally, I don't like pairing citrus with chocolate (I hate chocolate oranges), but here, the two components worked strangely well together. I would order this brownie again for myself if I see it on their menu in the future.

I picked the homiest dessert of all- gingerbread cake with sweet potato mousse and maple walnut fudge. Gingerbread, sweet potato, maple, and walnut are all favours that I adore, so it was an obvious choice for me. The cake was very moist and tasted delicious with the creamy mousse, but I couldn't really taste the sweet potato in the mousse. The cubes of maple walnut fudge were adorable, and their tiny size was perfect for such a rich concoction. Overall, I enjoyed my dessert, but I wish all the flavours were more intense- especially the gingerbread and sweet potato mousse.  

On the whole, I enjoyed my lunch at Bymark more than my first experience. The burger was good, though perhaps not the best burger I've ever had. Nevertheless, it was definitely a good deal for Winterlicious."}
{"text":"Maybe this place was great back in the day. I've heard some friends talk about it and say it is hard to get a table for summer/winterlicious. 

Pros: Intimate setting and decor. Acoustics are comfortable and the place was not loud. Good service, friendly. I liked the lemon icecream dessert mixed with basil and tasted my friend's short cake mixed with a herb and my other friend's chocolate tart - good. 

Cons: The meal itself. I found the shaved asparagus salad to be quite bitter, it had a mix of flavors but nothing fully satisfying. The Cod main meal - my friend had the same meal and she was also not pleased. She finished it though so that says something. I did not - that says something also. I found there to be too much polenta (too much of something is a bad thing?- well when it doesnt taste like much and feels more to be as filler than adding flavor - or maybe it was to offset the fish) The fish was pretty darned salty. I should have said something but it was as the border of too salty and salty. I was hoping it would improve as I got through it. Nope. Then it was mixed with the bitter greens. For me, this was such a disappointment since I had the salad and was not impressed but to have the main be bad too? I sat there thinking, if this were not summerlicious my dish would be so pricey. How awful to have the taste sub par but also the price putting a really useless dent in my wallet. 

I was told lately and have heard before that places are tending to give their sub par dishes for summerlicious because they are getting a lower price for it all. I do not think that this is what Bymark did, but I am left puzzled as to my friend's reviews of it all. 

When your meal is putting a dent in your wallet and/or a halt on your fitness regime - it had better be well worth it! Well at Least I tried this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Bymark for Winterlicious 3 times over 10 years and I've had  amazing food and a great experience each time. If you're downtown, it's a terrific place for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only got 3.5 stars (at the time of my review) because I thought the food was tasty and service was great and the private room we were in (or a vendor event) was very nice! We had to choose from a fixed menu and I got salad with bacon, salmon on quinoa, and pumpkin panna cotta. I usually don't like salads but pleasantly surprised that the salad was very good with dressing had some kick to it and even others at the table commented on. The salmon skin was crispy and yummy and the seasoning was mild but don't just right with the combo of grape tomatoes in the quinoa. Then the dessert came. I'm a huge fan of (good) panna cotta now this was a whole new way of doing it and it was fun, pretty, AND tasty! I am not loaded enough to go back myself often but would definitely recommends for the high rollers to check them out!"}
{"text":"Lobster Poutine! 

We have been to dinner here a few times and the Lobster Poutine is so good, we don't share it. If you are reading this and shaking your head about the decadence.. its worthy of your cholesterol going up a few points.

This restaurant is located inside a business mall, so for dinner, its not too busy.

The bread delivery person was a little stingy with the bread but they do bring you more when you ask for it.

We also ordered the hamburger, which is done to perfection! The Fish dish, which we devoured in minutes, it was really good.

Not cheap but worth the time."}
{"text":"This is another place to go when you have an expense account.... Not to say that their food is not good, but definitely pricey!!

The menu has a nice selection of local ingredients which is pretty cool!! The choices of bread are pretty good, but it's kinda annoying you have to wait for the bread guy to come around every time you want a refill.

A little disappointed at the services. It is just borderline ordinary at the caliber it claims to be at. The waiters and waitresses were just standing on the side. I see the manager at work more than them.... Who's in charge, here?!?!"}
{"text":"Very good food, very cool and classy establishment.  A bit pricey for lunch, even on an expense account - sandwiches AND main courses are about 25-28 dollars a piece.

Low rating is for very slow service.  If you have a week to eat, then it would earn five stars :)"}
{"text":"Ahh Bymark. How I love thee. This was my third visit to Bymark. I have only been during Winterlicious and Summerlicious as I can't afford it any other way. I do however manage to spend a small fortune when I go. 

This time around I took my mom. We parked underground and arrived about 30 mins early for our reservation. Parking is complimentary after 5:30.  Just ask the hostess before you leave for a voucher. Our hostess Kate advised us that our table was ready and we could start early if we wanted. Heck yes! 

We were seated against the wall. I volunteered to sit against the wall as it was a bit of a squeeze to get back there. 

Here's one of the reasons why I love Bymark - the service. The wait staff is amazing. They are attentive but not stuffy. They make you feel at home there. I hate pretentious restaurants. Our waiter this time around was fabulous and funny. I wish I remembered his name. 

We started with their Summerlicious signature cocktail \"Sugar and Spice\". Yummy! Ginger infused vodka with Limoncella and pineapple juice. Incredible. 

I then ordered the Lobster Poutine. If you haven't tried it you must. I'm not sure who came up with it but they're a genius. Fresh cut fries, chunks of fresh Maine lobster and Bearnaise sauce. I have to keep myself from licking the plate it's so good. 

Another yummy treat that they have is their bread service. A lovely young man whose sole purpose is to bring bread and butter to your table approaches with a basket of still warm olive baguette. I wanted to take him and his little butter dishes home with me. Sigh. 

Okay on to the Summerlicious part of the evening. We both started with the Tuna Sashimi. Perfectly rare slices of Tuna with sesame seeds, ponzu and jalapenos. Our main courses were rack of lamb with risotto and veal bolognese with gnocchi. The lamb and risotto were so good. The bolognese was a little tangy for me despite the fact that they had little dollops of fresh ricotta on top. The gnocchi were lovely though. 

Dessert is where I'm usually disappointed. Not this time. I had the warm banana cake with caramelized bananas on top. It smelled like a bananas foster. My mom had the petite chocolate eclair with chocolate ice cream. The pastry cream in the eclair was amazing! 

After dessert was over and our coffee and tea were enjoyed we rolled ourselves out of there. I can't wait till next time."}
{"text":"Bymark is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto so my Valentine did well by taking me here for a lovely dinner.

Located in the basement of the TD centre, the restaurant has a warm and welcoming feeling emitting an orange glow with a beautiful glassed-in wine cellar. Comfy banquets line both lengths of the restaurants but I prefer sitting at a table in the centre as it is more intimate and private.
Compliamentary coat checks and valet service are nice touches that is signature to Mark McEwan.

Our waiter comes over and introduces himself and leaves us with the menus and takes our drink orders. I already know what I want.

Lipstick Martini - Raspberry infused vodka, muddled fresh raspberries,
simple syrup, champagne
Refreshing delicious and not overly sweet and a beautiful fuschia hue.

After placing our order the \"Bread Boy\" comes around and offers a choice of warm bread. Multigrain, Olive, or French baguette.

For mains we both opt for the same
8 oz. Filet - Cooked perfectly medium rare, so tender and flavourful litterly melts in your mouth delish!

Sides
Yukon Gold Fries w/ lemon garlic aioli - Golden brown fresh cut thick fries right balance of saltiness and fried goodness I was craving

Roasted Brussels Sprouts w/ garlic & red wine shallot vinaigrette
My favourite veg! Cooked to perfection bringing out the natural sweetness with fried onions served in a cute little castiron pot I devoured them in no time!

Dessert
Chocolate Peanut Butter Torte w/ concord grape ice, crisp vanilla tuile
Loved the tartness of the grape icecream against the rich chocolate cake. I was expecting more of a peanutbutter punch than the drizzling of the peanutbutter cream however everything flowed and melded together deliciously

Trio of Desserts
Mini apple tart, mini creme brulee, & mini gingerbread cake.
I was too engulfed in my own dessert that when I went to snag a bite of my Valentine's dessert he had already cleaned the plate. So I take it was really good as well!

Tea - Sencha Green Tea
Served in a beautiful cast iron tea pot, mild tasting and delicate tea.

Overall service here was perfect from start to finish. Food is always outstanding and high quality and beautifully presented! A wonderful choice for a Romantic night out and definite way to score yourself some extra brownie points!"}
{"text":"The bar in Suits! So cool. Went here for business drinks and apps. Couldn't have been nicer staff, nice seat by the window, good lamb chops and better steak tartare. Highly recommend."}
