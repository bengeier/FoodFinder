{"text":"This tiny store is located in Bow Valley, off the second street entrance. I was lucky enough to get there before a huge lunch crowd swarmed behind me. The menu is small but it all looked delicious. I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich, side superfood salad and a small coffee.
For $4.00 the salad which lists ingredients like roasted cauliflower, sunflower seeds and baby kale, was a bit sparse. It was a small portion and had more Parmesan cheese than  anything. On the positive side, it was fresh. 
The size of the sandwich was substantial, the bread was soft, white and melt in your mouth and they stuffed a lot of tender meat inside. My issue was that there was waaaaay too much allspice flavour added and it didn't taste like jerk chicken at all. Also there was hardly any mango salsa inside, which made the allspice that much more noticeable. Seeing how popular this place is, I'm sure 
Butcher and baker will thrive. Despite my mixed feelings about the meal, it's obvious that it is trying hard to prepare quality food for the downtown crowd, and if I'm in the area again, I will definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"Love the Kale salad and order it pretty regularly, sometimes as a side with the mac and cheese. I was okay with paying there somewhat higher prices but now that they've increased their prices I would be hesitant to go back. People have already commented on the high price given the portions and now even their sides are up by 0.75 and the salad up $1."}
{"text":"Its not bad but nothing really stands out. The sandwiches are kinda pricey so I would expect it to taste amazing. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Really good sandwich, however the service is just not good enough. I waited 15 minutes for my sandwich last time just because there is a lack of organization surrounding the ordering and serving process. I think the food is really good however I never go there when it is busy or has more than 2 people waiting."}
{"text":"These guys do epic sandwiches. I highly recommend the shaved sirloin sandwich. They're cookies and soup are great too. They have however recently blocked contactless payments and Apple Pay on their payment terminal which is not ideal. I'd go back more if this was turned back on."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch and really had no idea what to expect. We had read about it in Avenue Magazine Calgary. We tried the Jerk Chicken and the special which was shaved Prime Rib. The Jerk Chicken was quite sweet, however the shaved prime rib was so delicious. Both sandwiches were very fresh! I would definitely recommend for a quick lunch on the go, but be aware it is not for the fast dining frugal luncher."}
{"text":"definite work is put forth in the meats.  sirloin wass excellent.  roasted 12 hours then souveed.  the soup was great altho too much black pepper causing the loss of a star.  also cookie was old and brittle but still good"}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple times now and have never had anything that wasn't incredible. My picky daughter loves everything we've had!

You will find the most amazing sandwiches and soups, homemade baked goods, fresh pressed juices, and a great mac and cheese.

There's a daily feature that's always yummy and its reasonably priced for a lunch combo. Lineups get a little long because it's lunchtime at bow valley square but it's worth the wait!!

They also do catering. Too bad it's not to my house!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Ordered a Jerk Chicken but thought they were cheap on mango. More mango would've helped offset the pungent flavor from the lime slaw as well. I really liked the tender chicken as it was the best part of the sandwich. There was quite a bit of meat for $9, which I thought was a fair price. Bun was soft on the inside and chewy on the outside.

I made it into a combo ($12) so it included a cookie and a soup. The Chocolate chip cookie was brittle so I didn't enjoy it. I couldn't tell what soup it was. I liked the texture of the soup which was slightly on the thicker side but didn't notice much flavor. At least it wasn't salty. Toppings were scarce as it had 3 little pasta noodles.

I'd come back to try other sandwiches but not the cookie or the soup."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this hip new sandwich shop. The thematic design was so hip, and the style looked amazing. Man was I ever disappointed! I came here for lunch one day, and I paid 12$ for a sandwich soup and a cookie. 

The sandwich felt like it had been premade in the morning. the bread was completely soaked and soggy and fell apart in my hands. The soup was a mish-mash of yesterdays unused cuts of meat and was very salty. At least the cookie was mediocre. 

Despite such an amazing aesthetic, this was a huge disappointment for me."}
{"text":"Their sandwich are interesting but the issue I have is that the sandwich I got was too salty. I got the pork belly sandwich and it had too much sauce and on top of that it was really fatty and salty. The pork belly didn't melt in my mouth but instead it was really chewy. 

This is sure one very unhealthy sandwich. I know pork belly has a lot of fat but because the sandwich was cold, biting into the pork belly meat was like biting into frozen cold gelatin fat. Yes it was pretty gross. 

Also  this place charges for tap water. Very nickel and dime.

Don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"A great little place I frequent for lunch. It's small but the food is fresh and delicious. The Mac and Cheese is spicy which makes it extra good and the soup of the day is always a favourite. They make fresh bread for their sandwiches (so good) and the fresh beverages really just top the meal off! The staff are always friendly and the place is clean! There isn't anywhere to sit so you have to take your food to go but it's always worth it. Everything is reasonably priced which is what keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches!! I had the tuna sandwich and it was really good! The location is very convenient and the prices reasonable!! This is an excellent fast lunch option in the area! I would definitely go back there!!"}
{"text":"the best lunch I had all week! I had the jerk chicken sandwich, and it was so good. the superfood salad had the potential to be awesome but it had way too much dressing so I was only able to have a few bites, but next time I'll know to ask for dressing on the side. service was quick & friendly, and I can't wait to go back! really cute logo and design, too!"}
