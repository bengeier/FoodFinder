{"text":"Came here for the happy hour, stayed for dinner.  The parmesian brussel sprouts, roasted mushrooms, and quinoa salad were great.  The size of the place (small), and the noise level were not so great.  Will want to come back in the fall and try the patio."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Little Cleo's last week while visiting friends in Phoenix. What a find!! Great food, great service and reasonably priced to boot! The grilled octopus starter is really tasty...and the fresh oyster selection is the best I've found south of Seattle! A great restaurant experience, and I'll definitely go back on my next trip south. Absolutely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit! The food and service were awesome. The bouillabaisse was wonderful and required and extra slice of the wonderful bread to finish the broth. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a nice dinner one night. I had read the Yelp reviews and was very excited to have found a seafood place in this dry desert. Since relocating from Vegas I feel that I have yet to find a good reliably sourced seafood place. Although Vegas is a desert as well, because of the tourism, there are always so many fresh yummy options( got to keep up with the competition). Anyway, we were seated after 20min wait, I loved that we were able to listen to the live music and hang out in the bar area as we waited. Once we were called we were sat in a small area in the restaurant, our server was very quick and receptive to our needs. I ordered the Jambalaya and it was so flavorful. Not only was it super flavorful, I received a large amount of shrimp. My husband ordered the bouillabaisse, it was perfect for the chilly night we were having. Overall we left satisfied and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"If you would like to spend $30 on a glorified entree that is the size of a decent appetizer, this is the place for you! If you like to wait 12 minutes for a glass of water when there are only 5 tables filled in the restaurant, this is the place for you! If you like food with no seasoning and tables with salt but no pepper, this is the place for you! If you like to wait 15 minutes for your raw oyster appetizer (after the 12 minute water wait), this is the place for you! If you like to waste your time, money, and have these to burn, this is the place for You!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a totally excellent meal at this restaurant. They fly in the seafood fresh every day.the scallop appetizer was very unusual and delicious,   Ahi tuna was great and the bouillabaisse was one of the best I've had: fish was extremely fresh,perfectly cooked and the broth was delicious.the  beignets for dessert also excellent.service was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I proposed to my girlfriend here and the staff was just as excited as I was.  Everyone was really friend and the food was just as good as the hospitality. We really enjoyed the tuna and the Octopus.  Thank you so much for making this special evening even better."}
{"text":"The Yard concept is cool and the ambience is great. The seafood restaurant is pretty good but it felt like it was missing some punch. The scallops were yummy. But when I spend $30 on a plate, I want it to be really memorable and exciting. Service was a little slow and the hostess sat us right on top of someone although there were five out empty seats.  Probably won't go back although it was somewhat enjoyable and alright."}
{"text":"Great place cool atmosphere We had the salmon dish and the king crab legs and they are both out of this world.  Our service was impeccable and we had a great night we suggest you get here soon!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. We sat at the bar and had fantastic service from Bobby. One (of many things) that Fox does right is they hire/train their staff and the service is always terrific  I always enjoy watching how everyone pitches in and all of the employees' outstanding attention to detail. I think other restaurants should take note, food tastes better when you are well taken care of...seriously!  I had a sour cherry paloma cocktail (a tequila based drink)  and I have to say it is probably my favorite drink in town now. Very yummy!It was served (as was my friend's beer) in a cute mason jar. The one caveat was that it was an $11.00 drink, (but easy to justify since I get a lot of Fox gift cards as gifts and used one Saturday night.) :) Yay!  My friend and I decided to share shrimp cocktail which I felt was a generous portion and the sauce had the right amount of kick. We also shared the king crab with butter in jar w/ grilled bread...yum...very succulent (not a word I use a lot...but my brain kept thinking it while I was eating...so i will go with it)...:) We also ordered some garlic fries with aioli saude..(oink..oink) They were thick cut wedges-pretty good but I probably wouldn't order them again.( I will save my french fry quota for the year for El Charro and their to-die-for truffle fries..)  I did not partake in their oysters which is their specialty but have made a commitment that that will be the route I take next time I am there.  The restaurant is located in the midst of the Yard and Culinary dropout and the Yard bar was hopping on Saturday night. Little Cleo's itself is quite small and very modern with an open kitchen and the back wall of restaurant opposite the  bar is all windows so you can people watch if you are so inclined."}
{"text":"If i had the option to give it a zero i would do. We went to the restaurant for dinner and most of tables were empty. He told us that the restaurants is fully booked and the only option would be either an outside table or the bar and if u wanted an inside table you should have had a reservation. In fact, before i went to the restaurant i have checked open table and it seemed that the restaurant have plenty of available tabels. So i prefered just to walk in. And we did so, as i thought most of the tabels were unoccupied. So i told him ok i will be back in a couple of minutes. So i decided to make a reservation at open table since there were as i said plenty of tables available. So i booked a table for 6:00 pm  and i was there at 5:55 pm. So i went back to the recption and told him that i have a resevation at 6. Guess what his response was!! Ok i can see that. You will still sit outside. All the inside tabels are reserved. I knew that he were lying since there wasnot any option of booking inside or outside, i was so upset and unpleasant as of that he did not even respect us."}
{"text":"As with many of the newer Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurants,Little Cleo's Seafood Legend is a great concept (that's what FRC is good at) but the delivery of that concept is wholly underwhelming.   I have enjoyed the FRC's restaurants since I was an undergraduate at UofA in Tucson. For a college kid, the fast casual Sauce and Wildflower were awesome. Zinburger and Blanco were great for semi upscale/familiar/fun dining. Lastly, North was a great restaurant for a college kid to be exposed to a broader range of upscale Italian cuisine.   But, sadly, it seems that FRC is letting its initial success go to its head! I have dined at Olive and Ivy, True food kitchen, Culinary Dropout, and now Little Cleo's Seafood Legend since moving up to the valley. For each one of these restaurants their is a common theme: The concept of the restaurant is new, intriguing, and refreshing, but the execution of the concept is sub par.  We first started off with the crab and grilled octopus small plates.   The crab is served in a jar with warm drawn butter. There wasn't a lot of crab, but for a $12 appetizer you get as much as you pay for. It was served with a side of grilled bread. The mason-like jar that contained the small bits of loose crab meat made it hard to get the last half of the crab meat out. It somewhat makes you look like you haven't had a meal in weeks as you stir around trying to get the last morsels of the crab out of the jar to enjoy. However, this is a criticism of the presentation of the dish. The actual crab, accompanied by the best grilled bread that I have had in a long time, was very good, especially considering the price tag of only $12. I give the crab appetizer 8/10   The grilled octopus was less appetizing. The octopus was not at all as tender as it needed to be. Octopus will almost always have a slightly tough texture, but when trying to slice the octopus requires you to work hard to saw it into pieces(I had given up on trying to slice the skirts), it is simply not cooked long enough. Apart from the work needed, we were given three approximately 3 ounce octopi with three quarter sized crispy masa cakes. The masa cakes were delicious, and went well with the octopus, but there should have been more to compliment the octopus. The masa cakes were the highlight of the dish. I give the grilled octopus 4/10  We also ordered the garlic fries to try while awaiting the entrees. I liked the cut of the fries, which was between the cut of steak fries and French fries, but there was no garlic flavor nor much salt for that matter. The rooster sauce aioli was not at all spicy and did not really retain siracha flavor, but was tasty. The major problem with the aioli was that the tablespoon amount was no match for the amount of fries. That left about a third of the under seasoned fries with nothing more to do than sit on the plate until the server cleared the table for the entree. I give the fries 3/10.  Next came the ahi tuna and the Cajun shrimp. The mushroom ginger dumplings were very good and the highlight of the entree. The ahi was seared well, had a great texture, and the taste of the fish itself was good. But just like a great steak, it still needs seasoning. There was no season to be found on the tuna and there was very little of the delicious spicy caramelized soy to compliment the tuna. I give the grilled ahi tuna 5/10 because of the dumplings, the sauce and the texture and perfect cook of the tuna.   The Cajun shrimp was better than the tuna. That grilled bread is outstanding! The shrimp were perfectly cooked and were meaty and medium-large sized. The sauce was a touch on the salty side, but with Cajun food, if it's not slightly over seasoned then it's under-seasoned! It was spicy but the spiciness was well balanced. The corn was cooked well and not at all overcooked, the potatoes were good as well, but after the fries I was all potatoed out. I would give the shrimp 7.5/10.  As a whole the crab and the shrimp were pretty good, but everything else was sub par. There are many, many more comparably priced restaurants that put forth much more creative, more balanced, and more delicious seafood dishes than what I experienced at Little Cleo's.   That seems to be the problem with the newer FRC restaurants. The concepts are neat, the names are cool and edgy, the new hipster/edgy culture is different. But in the end, it is just a facade, a marketing ploy to get people into the restaurant. The design and marketing of a restaurant should never surpass the actual food that the restaurant serves."}
{"text":"Wow, bad.  First the parking is non-existent.  Had to park across 7th street and risk death to get across the street.  Next insane noise level and craziness as this is inside the yard and culinary dropout. Shrimp poboy had zero flavor and mostly bread.  Cajun shrimp=large slice of French bread flat on plate, some shrimp tossed over top then 2 watery cobs of corn and a lot of very hot red sauce over all this.  Yuck.  Over priced lackluster wine list.  Uneducated staff.  Ordered sauvignon blanc, waiter poured into glass and ran out part way.  Came back with sancerre to fill other half of glass up. There are way better seafood places in town and this is not cheap."}
{"text":"Can I give it 7 stars ? This is consistantly the best food , best service and team effort in the Fox Family  . Check it out , you won't be disappointed  .  PS : How is the Chef able to work in Cleos and North at the same time ."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying Little Cleo's, but we were very disappointed by our dinner.  We were sat at a small table on the other side of the glass behind the hostess stand.  The hostess kept taking her feet out of her shoes and wiggling her toes in the air, which I couldnt help but constantly notice throughout dinner.  The service was okay, but our server never checked up on us to see if we liked anything or if we needed anything else.  I also didn't like that while having a nicer meal, the view next to us was of a bar scene and people playing lawn games, throws off the mood a bit.  The king crab toast was pretty good, I liked the orange in it.  I tried the cajun shrimp with red potato, corn and grilled bread.  It came out on a platter drenched in sauce that was so spicy I couldn't eat it.  Generally, I like spice and cajun seasoning, but this was too much and over everything (including the bread which had gotten soggy from the sauce) so there was nothing to even cut it with.  The shrimp were tough and overcooked.  Our server didn't say anything when he came to get my plate and I hadn't eaten much of my meal.  The burger was so soggy that the bottom bun fell apart.  Since we couldn't find our server, we asked another server for a new bun which she replaced."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I can't pick the best thing I've had on the menu but I can tell you that every thing I have had is fanFREAKINGtastick! Lobster in butter is a must. When I doubt,  bouillabaisse is amazing. The staff is very friendly and professional. Definitely do take  their recommendations. It is a very cool place to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Planned our outing to Little Cleo's as a celebratory dinner. Made reservation and arrived early.  Stepped inside and immediately had issues communicating with the hostess, she didn't make eye contact and it was very hard to hear her because the noise level, like Culinary Dropout's locations, is ridiculously loud.  Upon sitting at the table closest to the door, which is the table 3 people ahead of us declined, the manager offered us a complimentary glass of wine for waiting.  You could tell the hostess and manager were not in-sync with each other.  Our very nice waiter showed-up and assumed we were ready to order, maybe because we had a glass of wine in front of us.  We asked for menus and then, as he came back, he asked if we wanted to order an appetizer...we hadn't even looked at the menu.   And this is where our dining experience began...and ended.  We ended up ordering on the fly, with little suggestion or direction from the server, he basically stood at our table as we quickly reviewed the menu and then told us he'd have to 'put in what we wanted' because things 'sell out.'  Pressure+no suggestions+not being able to talk amongst the others at the table to know what they're eating, made for an 'oh well, we'll see what comes out,' type of meal.  Although the food is always good at a Fox Concept, we won't ever go to Little Cleo's or Culinary Dropout again.  We won't recommend it to friends who visit either.  The food servers are inexperienced and the atmosphere is always unreasonably loud and rushed.  My recommendation to the managers at these locations is to talk with your servers about what makes a great dining experience.  How do we get our guests to spend more money and how do we get them to come back?  1. Ask questions and spend 3-4 minutes getting to know your table.\" How are you, have you been here before, welcome back, what brings you in tonight??\" 2. Suggest a drink or a great glass of wine-- with an appetizer 3. Suggest meals that people can share and that might compliment their appetizer or other things at the table 4. Visit the table immediately after the meal is delivered by the expediter--Check to see things are cooked and to their liking. (we had to send back uncooked fish) 5. Ask the manager how we can make the restaurant a little less crazed and loud  It's not a bad thing to kneel down at the table or to find a way to get closer to who's ordering so we can hear you and you can hear us."}
{"text":"This place was great. Was in town from Seattle and a little skeptical of the thought of oysters in the desert, flown in daily or not.  Generally I'm not a huge oyster fan anyway but my dinner mate ordered them.  They we're probably the best oysters I've had in my mind, simply fantastic.  The horseradish that came with it was perfect. I got the crab butter dish, which was crab in a jar full of butter.  A little decadent but I loved it too.   Got the shrimp cocktail as well, which was great, the shrimp are peeled so that takes  care of the biggest pain of eating prawns. (My friend got some sort of salad, which she liked, i forgot which) But the best part of Little Cleo's the server was friendly and fun, as was all the rest of the staff.  Halfway through dinner my friend got a personal emergency call and returned distraught and upset - the server came right over and brought her a shot to calm her down. If i lived in AZ i'd be a regular."}
{"text":"The meal here was amazing. Each dish that was brought out was better than the previous. My boyfriend and I easily claim our dinner at Little Cleo's one of the best in the valley. I can't wait to come back. The brocollini vegetable side dish and the hush puppies were ridiculous. The tuna steak was amazing as well, and the pumpkin fritters were for sure the best way to end a truly delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I had a great first experience here. The staff was friendly, but not overbearing. The drinks were great as well. The food was fantastic.  The \"bacon and eggs\" with the sturgeon bacon was on another level it was so good. The oysters were very fresh. The tuna tartare was excellent also. The best dish I had there hands down was definitely the scallops crudo with brussels sprouts.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Was very excited to go for the first time, but   They were closed for a private event, even though they posted a picture on Instagram inviting people for their happy hour...no oysters for me"}
{"text":"For starters the folks at this place are genuine.  Rarely do you have a dining experience so perfect from the people to the food.   I wish I remembered  our servers name but he was awesome! The oysters AMAZING... The small plate scallops must must order!   Lobster roll OMG is the only way to describe it.   This place is legit!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutley AMAZING meal!!! I rarely post on yelp, but...The service was top notch, Ask for Bobby he was great! Food was amazing very we priced for delicious seafood! best fox restaurant I've been too, way different than the rest, much more intimate. The GM chatted with us for a while and was SUPER accommodating. Will deff be back!"}
{"text":"Three of us loved everything we had, which was the shrimp po boy ($14) black kale salad $10), fish and chips ($17), a mixed veggie dish called Romanesco ($6), and a special crab cake ($21).  There were only two modest size crab cakes, which were very good, but the price seemed high for the little portion.  Ask for a good description and the price before ordering the special of the day.  We had two good glasses of wine for $8 and $9.75.  With a $16 tip the total for the three of us was $114.28. Our server was very good, and she had a great 1940's theme hair style.  Very fun!    $3 tip for the valet parking.  Parking is valet only due to limited parking.  Don't let the line for valet parking scare you off.  It moves fast.  Go and have fun!"}
{"text":"This was the most pleasant dining experience I have had in recent memmory, from the moment we were greeted at the door until we left it was an absolute pleasure. The service was outstanding, they were very attentive without being too intrusive and our waier, i think his name was Wyndham, gave us an excellent rundown of the menu, down to describing the different flavors in the oysters of the day, his descriptions ofa ll the food and drink were great. We had the sturgeon toast, frog legs, and crab legs, then the donut for dessert. It was all amazing! I also liked the champagne cocktails, I believe they were called Royales. I cannot wait to go back!! I never write reviews but i feel i had to because it was such a great experience - both the food and service."}
{"text":"First yelp ever! And this is going to be so Long :/.  So I've worked in the service industry for 10+years and have always hated this site..but here I am..yelping..and I hate that I am going to do this but the service was T-E-R-R-I-B-L--E...waited at the host stand for almost 5 minutes before being greeted & sat for our reso..no water or greeting happened for almost 10 mins after being sat..then was greeted by the manager.  Was a great guy and helped us out, but after ordering our wine and beer from him took again almost 10 mins to get our drinks..oysters were awesome!! Crab in a jar phenomenal! Those items being the only reason why I'm giving Cleo's 3 stars. After these apps drinks were again empty..and no water! Ordered the grilled octopus as entree and half was beyond grilled, to a point of very crispy and blackened..no good..and when I complained to the server at the end of the meal all that I got was an apology..I really do hate doing this but the meal should have absolutely been taken off of our $120 bill..whatever we should have said something to the manager and not her..ambience sucked it was way too bright and this night being my \"valentines day\" I am beyond disappointed..it wasn't even busy and the service still sucked! Not impressed Sam fox, not impressed at all..."}
{"text":"Growing up on the Chesapeake Bay in Annapolis, Maryland, I was raised on seafood. From  lowly crab shacks to the pristine Chart House, it's life's blood there. I feel I'm a pretty good judge of these things, so onward.  My companion and I walked in on a Friday night at 6:45 and the place was almost empty. We had reservations made in advance, and the host asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar. In an empty restaurant. Not sure why anyone would sit at the bar on purpose. Anyhoo, just odd to me- he really tried to sell it.   I noticed straight away how warm it was in there. Like they had a swamp cooler or the AC just kind of sucked. It wasn't \"hot\" but it was a tad uncomfortable and didn't feel good.  I perused the menu and silently gave thanks that I had an old Fox Concepts gift card in my purse. The prices are little on the high side. Not outrageous, mind you, but more like, \"Erp, ok\".  I realize it's not oyster season, so I understand  seeing $24 for 6 oysters. However, the rest of the menu was disappointingly limited and pricey as well.   We went for a dozen oysters to start. My friend ordered frogs legs, and I ordered a lobster salad to follow. Honestly- it was so warm in there, I couldn't imagine ordering warm food as well.  I'm a bouillabaisse fan, but I just couldn't do it. Thus the cold salad.  The oysters were served promptly, and were cold, briny, and good tasting. No complaints there. I laughed at the lemon \"wedge\" that came with it, however. Imagine your standard lemon wedge and then shave that down to almost nothing. It was the size of my fingernail. And this was supposed to be for twelve oysters. K. Thanks.   The rest of the food came out fairly quickly. The frog legs were good, I helped myself to a bite of my friend's. My salad was tiiiiiiiiny, the size of a side dish and there was only about a spoonful of crab salad on top. $16.00 for this. The taste was just so-so. I feel like it should have been on the \"small plates\" section of the menu, or at least make it entree sized and charge a few more dollars.   Once again, thanking my good luck to still have that gift card because I would have been pretty sad when the bill came. Almost $70. For a dozen oysters and two appetizers. Yup. No drinks, no entree, no dessert. $70.   Not sure what the \"concept\" is here, honestly. I left hungry and generally irritated."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and seafood.  The front counter by the oyster bar is very cool and where we wanted to sit to be in all the action, but it was already full so we sat at one of the little tables right behind it.  We ordered the \"king crab in a jar\" appetizer ($22) and omg it was awesome!!  Both of our entrees were very tasty as well.  I ordered the ahi tuna and my husband got the cajun shrimp.  Portions are not huge, I was able to finish my entire plate which never happens!!  If you are a big eater, you might need to order an extra appetizer or one of the vegetable sides or something.  We had the donuts for dessert which were so good as well.    Plan to spend some dough at this place, especially if you are getting drinks, desserts etc.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time it has been a perfect experience.  The food is excellent and the wait staff is just as good.  I also like the old style look of the place and that it has both table and raw bar seating, which looks into the clean, busy and stylish kitchen.  A few of the menu items I've had are diver scallops crudo, grilled octopus, peel & eat shrimp, roasted artichoke hearts, blue crab salad, halibut and bouillabaisse.  The wine selection is also very good.  I recently had a pinot noir on tap that was fantastic.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lobster roll , champagne -- absolutely magnificent Sam was extraordinary , could not be better!!!"}
{"text":"I initially went to this restaurant for the raw oyster bar as I am a huge fan and it is tough to find fresh oysters in Arizona. I ended up loving this restaurant and the entire menu. We had oysters, frog legs and tried a southern dish that was extremely good. The food is absolutely wonderful, the staff is very friendly and professionally trained.   For a Phoenix restaurant, I have to put this one as one of my favorites and I look forward to going back with my wife."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the cuisine at Little Cleo's. Wish we could make it out there more. The shrimp po boy is incredible, even though it's not as sophisticated as their other dishes, it is a solid dish, well worth the price. Frog legs are delicious too, even though we were intimidated by them at first, the hostess talked us into getting them and we loved it. Their happy hour is good if you like oysters and shrimp, but leaves something to be desired when it comes to drinks, all they have on special is absinthe and champagne, which no one really drinks! I've only gone in during the week, its quieter than how loud and crazy the whole complex gets on the weekends. The atmosphere is good, the music adds to the retro oyster bar spirit they have. Sometimes it'll be a little packed so you have to sit at the bar but it's a blast to watch the chefs work while you eat. We came for dinner on Wednesday, it was very busy since they had an event the \"legend dinner\", a five course dinner with wine pairings, which looked and smelled great but we were disappointed to learn that you have to book a spot for it in advance. (Lobster tamales?? I was intrigued.) This was the first time I've had a bad encounter with an employee there. The host was haughty and angry that we would come in without a reservation? We almost had to leave but the other host jumped in and got us seated in a matter of minutes. Regardless, we will definitely be making a reservation for the july legend dinner. The hostess we usually see is a doll and our servers have been attentive and warm without fail, my cup has never been empty at Little Cleo's!! We especially love having Joell, request her if you can!"}
{"text":"Went here for NYE, every course was amazing! Pricey, but super fresh and flavorful. Plus it has a great atmosphere and service is impecible!"}
{"text":"I thought about deducting a star for the problematic parking situation at Little Cleo's, but the overall experience and food were just too good!  The interior is clean, a tiny bit loud, but well lit and the tables are not crowded.  I was dining with a client, who happens to be a seafood distributor, so we tried just about everything...the meal was AMAZING from start to finish!  We were treated to some complimentary frog legs by the kitchen, it was a good move by them, because those will definitely be something that I order on future visits.  I had never had a frog leg before, so I don't have much to compare, but these were crispy, crunch and dressed in a sweet chile sauce, making them finger licking good, they are a don't miss dish there.  We then had oysters, I don't remember the different kinds that we had, but they were all delicious especially when topped with the house made cocktail sauce that had freshly grated horseradish sprinkled on top.  That same cocktail sauce was also served with the cold shrimp appetizer, the boil seasoning was really good, and added nice flavoring to the shrimp.  We also tried the hush puppies, they were nice and moist unlike some that I have experienced that have been dry and crumbly, they had a nice dipping sauce that they were served with, but it was necessary, they were just as good plain!  For my main course I ordered the Cajun Spice Shrimp....wow...this was an amazing dish!!  I think it is their version of Nawlin's BBQ shrimp, which I happen to love, and this dish brought just enough heat, but not enough to overwhelm the flavor.  There was also some corn and red potatoes in the mix, as well as some nice toasty bread to soak up all of the delicious sauce.  It was truly magic on the plate.  I would 100% recommend Little Cleo's to someone looking for their seafood fix in the desert...even if it means having to circle the block 3 times looking for a parking spot because the valet lot is full."}
{"text":"Went for National Oyster Day on August 5 and loved the ambiance of the space- the bar had the feel of a retro countertop and there was a night long happy hour in celebration of National Oyster Day.   We enjoyed a $5 subtle menace cocktail (gin + absinthe + sauv blanc + lime) which was very refreshing and $2 champagne.  We ordered a dozen oysters and they did not disappoint. They were only $1 each but the size was almost double that I've had at other valley restaurants. They were served with a mignonette and a house cocktail sauce. The sauces weren't too noteworthy but it worked because it placed a greater emphasis on the oysters.  The bartender at Culinary Dropout told us we had to get the bacon + eggs at Little Cleo's because it was the best thing on the menu. We heeded his recommendation and were pleased with the dish. It was incredibly tasty and substantial enough so that even after splitting the dish I felt satisfied.  We also had the diver scallop crudo, which was probably the weakest link out of the night. The ingredients were all great- the scallop, avocado, tomatoes, and corn tasted fresh but there seemed to be something missing.   All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our experience- each member of the staff was incredibly friendly and gracious. An additional touch I enjoyed were the unique bottle cap magnets they used for the check."}
{"text":"A Sam Fox concept does it again. Uneven. Mediocre dishes that are expensive, and good dishes that are expensive. By now I should know to expect this. Every Sam Fox experience ends in sticker shock because of the uneven quality of the food. Stick to the raw oysters and shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Exceptional service with a relaxed vibe in order to let the food do the talking. Looking forward to our next visit to try the frog legs!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of a seafood lover, and I have always had difficulty finding good seafood here in Arizona; fortunately, I lucked upon Little Cleo's way back in January, and haven't even thought about going anywhere else since. This, without a doubt, is the best seafood you'll find anywhere in Arizona, and I believe I can say that with confidence. Everything they make is fresh and deliciously prepared; even better, they also offer some unique dishes that you won't find anywhere else (for instance, they are the only place that offers Sturgeon bacon and eggs, and it is absolutely fantastic). And, on top of all this, the service is fantastic! I always feel welcome, and even on busy nights we are not kept waiting for long. If you are looking for some specific recommendations on food, everything I've tried so far has been incredible BUT if you are feeling like splurging, the grilled loup de mer with artichokes and shallots is the best fish dish I have had in Arizona. Try it; you won't be disappointed (oh, and the grilled octopus with masa and serrano is amazing as well!)  Overall, this place is simply one of those restaurants that you have to try if you enjoy seafood.With great food, impeccable service, and an enjoyable atmosphere to boot, it is a can't miss in my book!"}
{"text":"The $1 oysters during Little Cleo's brief happy hour are what drew me in and the rest did not disappoint. Like all FRCs, the ambience and service was super dupes, and like some FRCs, the food and drink was pretty damn good.   I had a champagne Royale with sage and honeysuckle and it was such sippy yumness, I'd drink a half dozen if not for the sweetness. The $2 champagne pour was also delightful. They did not have the saison that was on the menu (*sob*) but the IPA on tap was decent enough.  The HH oysters were salty gems of joy, mignonette was fairly good. Frog legs were so tender and wonderfully fatty, though the sauce was a bit too strong for me, but others at the table loved the punch of it. Hush puppies were fluffy little morsels, the dipping sauce a bit heavy but tasty nonetheless. The lobster roll was good, but needed more lemon and salt, and the dressing was a touch on the thin side. On the other hand, the spinach was a salt BOMB, great flavors and perfectly wilted but inedible by halfway through the portion. Didn't opt for dessert but my compatriots seemed to enjoy their banoffee tart well enough.   Far from legendary, but I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Deeee~licious!   bouillabaisse!!! Fabulos!  Server... attentive... and I thought it was so cute when she would use her upper~crust butler accent with the diners next to us :)  I thought Molly Tarlov was their server (awesome!!!)"}
{"text":"If you like fresh seafood this is the place for you!!  From the amazing raw bar to seafood entrees this place has it covered and the service was top notch as well"}
{"text":"Calling Little Cleo's a \"seafood place\" makes you think of restaurants that wheel-barrow crab legs to your table, and \"oyster bar\" is too reductive. I'll call it a thoughtfully conceived, perfectly executed restaurant. I don't know who Sam Fox is, but I'd love to buy him a drink and talk shop for a few minutes.  The philosophy of this place seems to be that nothing should distract from impeccable fish. Not the decor, which is clean and unpretentious, nor even the customers: my server gently steered me away from messing up my order, which I greatly appreciated when enjoying my meal. The entire staff are rightly proud of their restaurant, and it shows in the service.  The oysters: wonderful selection, impossibly fresh. The tuna was amazing, and, considering the composition, quality, cooking, and presentation, a steal at twenty bucks.   Drinks? They aren't just dressed-up classics, but innovative as the design of the restaurant. I had the \"subtle menace,\" a brilliant recipe based on gin and lime, thinned with some sauvignon blanc, with absinthe functioning as the bitters.  And try the desserts--nothing in this place is an after-thought.  Little Cleo's is my favorite place in Phoenix, and one of my top dining experiences."}
{"text":"Ambience:  industrial, open, noisy, crowded (tables right underfoot of guests and wait staff  Food quality:  very good  Food quantity (per serving):  meager  Service:  very good  Price:  Expensive  We came here from a glowing recommendation from a friend and a darned good score on Yelp.  But we weren't terribly impressed at all.  My \"large entree\" was total of 10 bites.  I don't have a huge mouth, mind you.  3 small pieces of (*delicious!*) seared ahi with 2 teeny tiny dumplings/potstickers (see pic).  Tasty but left a tremendous amount to be desired, including continued hunger.  Price:  $27!!!!  WHAT?!! This isn't Mastro's Steakhouse, for goodness sake!  All our dishes from appetizer to desert were stingy.  Warm jar crab = tasty butter soaked crab meat and burned (yes, burned) toast.  The beignets were scrumptious, but again only a few bites.  Beer served in a can (no glass offered)?  I don't mind except when I'm spending this kind of money."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Arizona. We come to Phoenix a couple of times a year from Tucson just to eat here. Warm jar of lobster, cream corn fritters, oysters, pretty much everything they make it's fantastic. The stapff has been the same for the past 3-4 years, that we have been coming here, and they are all friendly and knowledgeable. Sitting at the counter is an awesome experience. We'll be back in a few months."}
{"text":"The service was great, and very prompt. My only complaint was that it is a bit pricey. The oysters were wonderful. However, they looked at me strangely when I asked for saltine crackers. Maybe it's just a regional thing, but I don't think I've ever had a raw oyster without them. Bring your own I guess."}
{"text":"We showed up from out of town at a work conference for a reservation for 8 at their sister restaurant Culinary Dropout. We were greeted by a hostess who told us the restaurant was closed for a private party. This was after a 40 combined cab ride to get there. After much negotiations with the manager of Culinary Dropout, who he brought us to Little Cleo's. And thank GOD he did. They heard about our issue and the manager and server of Little Cleo's immediately went out of their way to make up for it with free champagne, discount on dinner and a special desert. The service was perfect- he explained the food in great detail and knew what to recommend. He was also extremely friendly and outgoing. The food was perfection- oysters on the half shell were amazing, crab in the jar- omg incredible.  Grilled octopus was melt in the mouth good. Everything we ate was delicious and perfectly seasoned and prepared. I could go on and on. This place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Best shrimp po boy ever. The frog legs are also quite nice. Had the raw oysters the lat last time we dined there. They were epic. Very good place for seafood."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and both times the crab in a jar was awesome! The oysters are also very fresh. The beignets are also super good, not too greasy, not too sweet. The tuna with little dumplings is also very delicious.  But I'd have to say my favorite part of the whole restaurant is being able to sit at the bar and watch as your food is prepared. It's like watching a cooking show but then you get to eat it afterwards."}
{"text":"My first visit was with my mother...our husbands are not fans of seafood, so a mother-daughter date night was our chance to try out this new(er) Fox endeavor.  Holy heck am I happy we chose Little Cleo's!  We were sat immediately with no reservation, narrowly escaping the wait line that followed.  The server, who admitted that she was merely helping out that evening and typically serves at Culinary Dropout next door, was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the menu and walked us through the oyster choices for the evening.  She was attentive throughout our visit.  We selected and loved all of the following (my favs are starred **):  - (3) types of oysters  - **sweet corn \"elote\"**  - sauteed artichokes & asparagus  - **wild sockeye salmon (on the server's recommendation)**  - **\"bouillabaise\"**  I also had my favorite cocktail there, the Grapefrut and Elderflower Royale - SO GOOD.  2nd visit was with my brother and tried (and loved):  - **sweet corn hush puppies**  - **crispy frog legs** (a first for me, and surprisingly delish)  - sweet corn \"elote\" (again!)  - **buttermilk pie**  My brother has been back since with his wife and I'll most likely take my husband back (there IS a grass fed NY strip for him, after all) and try the absinthe, which I enjoyed learning about from one of the bartenders working."}
{"text":"Ask for Hannah!! She's so sweet and has the best recommendations. We had warm crab in a pot (x2) and it was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"OMG. Just had a big culinary O. Phenomenal at the very least. The menu had perfectly paired flavors with some comfort foods like the jar of hot buttery crab legs and some new trendy flavors like salmon with sugar snap risotto with a hint of lemongrass. The service was expedient and very friendly. Sam (the host?) knows the menu inside and out and can articulate with passion the options. He's so sweet you will want to squeeze him. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place for oysters and their buttered king crab.  The best thing that you need to know is they have a happy hour M-Sat that includes $2 champagne glasses and $2 oysters-- and they are nice oysters. I can't go to Casey Moore's anymore because of this alone. They are flown in daily and the wait staff can almost always tell you exactly what to expect.   Also tasty things you should try here: -absinthe cocktails -anything with octopus -squid ink pasta (trust me) -frog legs  They also have these special events-- they'll put on a 5-course meal special, or recently, a traditional crawfish boil, and they do not disappoint. This is my food \"treat yo self\" place pretty much all the time.  Probably one of the best seafood places you can find in town."}
{"text":"EW. That about captures it.   We were so excited to see a new Fox Restaurant Concept open up in town. Also, we are HUGE oyster and seafood fans and that's why we were so curious about this restaurant -- especially when they have a huge oyster area up front and state they ship the oysters in fresh every day. However, there is NO WAY these oysters were fresh. They had a mushy/creamy consistency that made it impossible to want to finish them.   We also tried the shrimp cocktail and jar of crab appetizers. Neither one of these were disgusting, but they weren't good. The shrimp cocktail from Costco is much better than this one was and cheaper. The crab was over cooked and extremely pricey for the quality and amount you receive.   This place is expensive to try and not worth it. My advice is skip Little Cleo's and try a different Fox Restaurant Concept instead."}
{"text":"Joelle gave our table of four GREAT service! She wasn't overbearing or impatient with our slow decision making. Food was Awesome, atmosphere was great, highly recommend it! We even tried the frog legs! Do it!"}
{"text":"I am biased because I LOVE SEAFOOD!! The wide selection of oysters were perfect for me. The lobster dip, perfect. The Bouillabaisse, perfect. The LARGE scallops, perfect. Just everything... PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Attn. seafood lovers!!!! My husband and I were craving oysters & decided to dine @ little Cleo's. So glad we did:) from the second we walked in, to the time we left...everything was perfect. No reservation and on Saturday night, sitting at the bar was our only option. A few minutes in, we high fived and were pleasantly suprised at how much we enjoyed it. Highly recommend starting off by having Salva Vida (Honduras-American Style Lager). First time drinking it and it was spectacular! I tried talking our server into selling us a 6 pack-No Go (you can get at Total Wine) Ordered a dozen oysters (they were not huge but reasonably sized) and my husband and I loved them. For the apps-we had Frog Legs (I didn't eat but the boy did) & he said the chili paste with peanuts made the dish & the Grilled octopus was super yummy. I would suggest ordering the Jar of Crab with grilled garlic bread (Noted for next time). For our entree (we split)-king crab legs (perfection), sautéed mushrooms, asparagus & artichokes & sweet \"elote\" corn. Ummmm, can we say \"mouthgasm\" ! After a couple more Silvas...we welcomed the Donut balls (lightly crusted outside with a warm gooey inside)-accompanied with a side of chocolate, vanilla bean & strawberry sauce for your dipping pleasure. Our smiles were only slightly larger than our full bellies as we rolled out of the restaurant and in the end my husband and I gladly gave Little Cleo's a 10!  Bon Appetite"}
{"text":"Fun menu, great appetizers and salads. Good clean food left us feeling satisfied and happy, waitstaff was great. Great place for a fun double date and adventurous dishes to try!"}
{"text":"Food is good, nice ambience, the service is substandard. We had to wait for 15 minutes for our reserved table, even though it was empty and it took them so long to clean and set it. We were graciously offered drinks while waiting, but they took 20 minutes to arrive.   My wife and I had 2 dozen of their California oysters, Grassy Bar and Carlsbad Luna, and at $14 per half dozen they are good value, and very fresh. We had their more expensive oysters (Kusshi from BC) last time, and didn't like them too much (too sweet and creamy). Grassy Bar, in our opinion were the best, nicely balanced, slight mineral taste, not too sweet not too salty, nice texture and aftertaste.   Oysters were followed by crispy frog legs in thai sauce, roasted octopus, bouillabaisse, and buttermilk cake. The food was delicious, although bouillabaisse was a little on a saltier side. The service was friendly, but inattentive. We had to constantly ask for napkins, cutlery, water, wine top up, and bread. The waiters were very apologetic every time but still inept. I've seen better service at some cheap diners. It's a pity that the management doesn't make an effort to recruit and/or train the right staff. We were there a couple of times last year, and the service was much better then.  We'll probably come back again for oysters (they have a nice oyster bar), but don't expect much in terms of service."}
{"text":"Great tasting food but 100$ for two people and I'm still hungry. The amount of food I would have expected at lunch, not dinner. 2 drinks and 1 meal per person costs way too much here. And I was there for happy hour! Won't be back for dinner but will try lunch to see if the meals are comparable to most other restaurants."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried out this lil' hidden gem for our Friday date night. Located inside of the Yard on 7th St, this place will make you feel like you died and went to seafood heaven! We started out with the King crab in a jar, which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The crab was so flavorful and fresh! I had the crab tagliatelle and my boyfriend had the Shrimp Po Boy sandwich! Both were definitely 5 stars! Service was great as the staff was extremely attentive! I loved this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went there as a group of 10 for a bday party. Complementary valet parking was nice. Everyone loved the food and the cocktails were amazing. The service was awesome. My only real complaint was that it was so hot in there. I mean tons of windows without shades and the sunlight streaming in  was killer. Not to mention there were no fans overhead as there were in the outside area. Almost everyone complained about the heat. We got there about 6:30pm. The place is very small so if you have a large group I highly suggest calling and making a reservation. Also they were out of the donuts For dessert so one of my friends was disappointed. Very nice atmosphere, three restaurants in one joined by a nicely lit outdoor patio bar common area."}
{"text":"Yesterday's dinner was quite pleasant. I ordered  the sweet corn \"small plate\", king crab in a jar which came with lots of yummy bread bites and was absolutely delicious and oysters. All was quite tasty including my dinner dates salad. Only complaints we had is we both did not care for are wines. I had the rose which I tend to enjoy but the brand they had was not tasty and I can't remember what my dinner pal had but I do know it was a white wine. Enjoyed this place nonetheless even with the disappointing drinks I will return for the food !!"}
{"text":"be prepared to spend some cash...but everything, from cocktails to veggie sides is impeccably crafted and complex and delicious. the oysters are amazing--there is a selection (usually three kinds) and the waiters are very knowledgeable and helpful in guiding your choices. it is a great time. an awesome experience. but it doesn't come cheap."}
{"text":"Made reservations on Open Table for 7:45 on a busy Saturday night, showed up half hour early and were promptly seated.  For appetizers I ordered a half dozen oysters and my wife got the sweetcorn hush puppies, both of which were awesome.  I ordered the bouillabaisse, which I wish was a little spicier, but that's just a personal preference. It was very filling and cooked perfectly. My wife ordered a few of the vegetable sides, all of which she liked as well.  Parking is a little difficult but the complimentary valet is quick.  Overall I was very impressed, would recommend."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Service is always exceptional and the food is awesome.  We have tried pretty much every dish and have not had even a mediocre dish. All are amazing.  Our favorite is the king crab leg in a jar. Best splurge on the menu! The oysters are always fresh and tasty. Our least favorite would be the absinthe but that's just personal preference. Overall we would give 10 stars if we could!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants due to their consistently excellent quality seafood. It's not a huge menu, but every dish is perfection. My favorite is the loup de mer (Branzino) - perfectly grilled mild fish with grapefruit. Add happy hour $1 oysters or shrimp to start and you have a delicious yet healthy dinner."}
{"text":"I just went to Little Cleos for the first time tonight - it was great! The night started off with some happy hour drinks which included $2 champagne refills. It's almost Christmas so we decided to celebrate with some of these.   We ordered the diver scallop crudo to begin with, as well as some oysters and several pieces of jumbo shrimp. I wasn't a fan of the oysters but the shrimp were good, the cocktail sauce had a little kick to it which I loved, and the scallops were soooo flavorful and delicious.   For the main course, I ordered the ahi tuna with mushroom/ginger dumplings. It was decent and cooked nicely, but wasn't anything memorable. I ordered a side of Brussel sprouts with parmesean and those were the best part of my meal. So delicious! The garlic fries with aoli sauce were also pretty darn good.   For dessert, we shared the toffee pudding with Nutella ice cream and it was unreal. I don't normally order dessert from restaurants, but I am so thankful for ordering this one tonight. You could call it a Christmas miracle! Words cannot accurately describe how savory and decadent this pudding was. Wow.   Our server was great - polite and just the right amount of attentive.   I would definitely recommend trying Little Cleos out. And then playing some games at the Yard after =)"}
{"text":"Love this quaint Oyster bar. The concept of the diner theme is so much fun. They have tables but sitting at the 50's type bar and ordering oysters with a glass of wine is a good time in itself. They have oysters by the 1/2 dozen and are decently priced. Their oysters are always fresh and are plated perfectly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here at Little Cleo's. I rarely do review but feel this place was a must to review! We have lived in AZ for about 7 years and this is the first time we have tried oysters here as we are used to eating them fresh from the Bay on the east coast. The food was amazing, the oysters were so delicious and not to mention the service could not have been better! Kelly was our server and she was amazing. I cannot wait to go back and request Kelly as well!"}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time having ordered almost identical items from a great Boston restaurant just the night before: oysters, clam chowder, and a lobster roll.  Little Cleo's was almost a match in service, quality and price to the seafood place in Boston. I think that's  saying a heck of a lot for a restaurant in the desert..  The atmosphere is wonderful and, it has a hip, 1940s East Coast atmosphere.  This is definitely my new go-to place for seafood. Congratulations, fox restaurants for another great addition to the valley."}
{"text":"The hubby and I decided last minute to look for a restaurant on New Year's Eve.  Since we are both seafood lovers, that is where my search began.  Other than sitting outside and the weather being a little chilly, the food was outstanding.  It was a pre-fix menu, with choices of the main entree and the dessert.  We both had the seafood soup and the boulliabase (spelling may not be correct) and our waitress recommended her suggestions for dessert, which were spot on!  I can't wait to go back.  The meal was outstanding and I am looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"After vowing never to return to the yard after what was considered the most careless and insulting dining experiences at CD; new venues started to open. Silvana opened Barrio Urbano- ok I'm always a fan of her's. It was great- we started warming back up, and then inquired about what looked like an oyster bar next door? Fast forward almost a year later we finally gave it a go out of forgetfulness. WOW. Raw bar and sea food inspired entrees to rival any New York eatery (as a former New Yorker-it's blue ribbon meets CAFEteria meets blue fin/blue water grill). Simple. Clean. Bursting with flavor. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive but never \"hovered.\" The seating although at first glance appears compact- you would never know that 2 feet away from you was another table, as the menu items transfix you to another place. Thank you chef, management and staff for an unbelievable experience RIGHT HERE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!"}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is very hipster. I was very pleased with the food here. Authentic lobster rolls and fantastic deserts. Service was great even when they were busy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on our 14 year anniversary on 7/17 and received customer service and food from out of this world. There was one waitress working the entire restaurant and when I say she worked the entire restaurant that's exactly what I mean.  I wish I could remember her name but she was calm and polite serving over 6 tables of guests. I'm kinda a eye wonderer and noticed not only did she give us great service but everyone else. She didn't even know it was our anniversary but we didn't want for nothing while we were there. She came by often, but not too often to check on us.   The ambiance was perfect....classy with a touch of vintage. I'm a sucker for anything old fashion so when I saw the diner stool setting I was in love at first sight ( and bite ) we went during happy hour and enjoyed the oysters, shrimp cocktail and shared the fried fish which I highly recommend. Don't pass this place up, I wish I could give it 10 stars!    5/12 Little Cleo's is closing ;("}
{"text":"Love the concept and the food is fresh. The oysters were fresh and $1 at happy hour. The happy hour shrimp was also $1, but tasted no different than COSTCO's peel and eat shrimp. Crab in a mason jar filled with clarified butter was good, but a bit pricey. The octopus appetizer wasn't what I expected. It was baby octopus (or little octopus) served with a tomato based sauce. The sauce was good, but the texture of the octopus was really soft and mushy-like. I tend to like the meatier traditional type octopus, roasted and tender. I didn't try any of the main courses, but want to come back and try their fish entrees. I liked the super casual vibe and the service was excellent. Since this little gem is nestled between two other restaurants, the parking situation is not ideal. It's valet only and there is no street parking int he neighborhood (residents with permits only). Since we are in a desert with not many fresh seafood choices offered at casual style restaurants, I will check this spot out when I get my seafood cravings."}
{"text":"We were here last Saturday for AZ Restaurant Week. We had a 6pm reservation and noticed the parking lot was FULL. They told our friends behind us that valet was full/closed, until they mentioned they had a dinner reservation, and then space miraculously opened. Note that street parking is by permit only, so valet is your only option.  Little Cleo's was pretty small and, disappointingly, didn't have any patio seating. It also appears to appeal more to an older crowd (or maybe we just ate at \"older crowd\" eating time!). But it was cool inside, a bit retro.  We started with shrimp and oysters. All amazing. Hubby had the best frog legs we've ever eaten, with a Thai chili sauce. I had the grilled octopus, which I would pass on. Hubby had fish and chips, saying the fish was really good. I had the mussels and squid ink pasta (again, just ok). For dessert hubby got the beignets, which were fluffy little pillows from heaven. They were amazing. I had the buttermilk tart, which needed a tad more fruit but was yummy.  So why the five stars if my food was only good? Well, first, I had three impeccable cocktails, at just $8 each. Second, our server was AMAZING. I mean, really, really good. She coursed the meal perfectly, checked in when appropriate, we wanted for nothing... She really made the experience perfect. It was a great atmosphere and a tremendous value, so they get 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Although I enjoy the food and atmosphere at the nearby Yard, the service there has been lacking. When I went into Cleo's located inside the Yard I was impressed with the food, service and atmosphere. It's a small restaurant with friendly service, creative seafood and yummy cocktails."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! We showed up 20 mins earlier than our reservation, and the hostess set us up at the window seating for drinks. We were seated within 10 mins. Our server Leontine was awesome! She was very nice and friendly. Oysters are great! Tuna tartare was delicious. The entree we ordered was delicious as well along with our desert! If you haven't been, you definitely should try it out!"}
{"text":"First time experience and probably will be the last.  They share a space with The Yard and valet was full and there was literally no where to park.  We had to park quarter of a mile down the road and walk to this place.  I was in the mood for some Cajun/seafood, so I gave this place a try.  I read all the great reviews, so I eventually wanted to see what this place was all about.  We arrived on a Saturday night.  The place was packed!  There was a party going on in the yard,  which made parking and service terrible!  Since we didn't have a reservation, we were told our only option was the counter....even though there were couple of empty tables, but anyways...The service was really bad....it took forever to get our drinks and the appetizers we ordered, literally came at the same time as our main entree.  We wanted to order some oysters, but they ran out! then we wanted to order some calamari, and they were out of that as well.  So we settled for their corn hushpuppies and brussel; sprouts and dinner we ordered the black squid ink pasta with mussels and fish and chips.  The hushpuppies were good, but weren't a lot of them.  Especially how cheap they are to make, you would figure they would hook it up a little.  Brussell sprouts were ok, the pasta was a little bland, and the fish and chips were decent.  Really nothing positive to rave about this place.  I would say, horrible parking situation, poor service, and lackluster food would definitely keep me from coming back to this place.  I would say these Fox Concept restaurants are a true hit or miss, and this miss the mark completely.  I can't say I would recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Great food, every bite was delicious. My issue was the price vs. venue. Probably 300 people in the yard but Little Cleos was empty. We rushed around to try to make a last call on happy hour only to find it has changed from 4-6 to 4-5, why even have one? Fox always works to get it right, I think they have some work to do on this restaurant to make it work in its surroundings."}
{"text":"Our third time and great every time! I had the salmon with butternut squash and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"WOW! We heard there was a new Fox restaurant concept that was focused on seafood and we had to make the trip to go check it out. It was 100% worth the almost 2 hour drive. This place is a little hard to find but it is in the same area as another fox restaurant called culinary dropout in Phoenix. It offers valet service and I would suggest you use it because any other parking is hard to find. Upon arrival we were almost immediately greeted by the General Manager Blake, what a awesome guy. He thanked us for coming all the way down from Globe and he made our dining experience extraordinary.   Overall everything we tried was excellent. We had 2 appetizers one was a blue crab toast and the other was a warm jar of buttered crab, both were out of this world good. For entrees we ordered the Cajun shrimp, the bouillabaisse, and the fish and chips. All three were excellent. The Cajun shrimp has a good amount of spice and the fish and chips, for being fried, was very light and flaky.    I would highly recommend trying Little Cloe's Seafood Legend. This is definitely our new favorite seafood place in the Valley. Everything is flown in fresh daily and you can tell."}
{"text":"This is not your typical seafood restaurant it's more of a bar than anything that has Seafood everything's ala carte and pretty small portions and pricey which sea food should be if it's great right but unfortunately I was starving so the best option was the poor boy it was good and feeling a little salty though and the bread was a little dry it was okay my son hand fish and chips he thought they were the best fish and chips he's ever had so I think I'll be getting those next time I also had the pecan pie which was great it was just a little too small some big fat kid and I love desserts so I guess I need to order to definitely go back though"}
{"text":"The king crab in drawn butter in the mason jar is incredible! Great selection at the oyster bar.  Sit right up there if you can and watch the action in the kitchen. We did by accident when we went once and did not have reservations at a busier time. They will make adjustments to salads like adding shrimp instead of crab for people who need changes. Very friendly staff.  Valet parking makes what seems like a parking challenge very easy.  Be sure to enjoy the bread to get the last bit of everything!"}
{"text":"Yes. We went here for dinner a few weeks ago for the first time and settled on some \"small plates\" to just get a taste of the quality. The food was absolutely delicious. We went on a Friday night so it was pretty busy but not as loud as I expected with everything going on right outside which was nice.   We ordered the ahi tuna tartare, the warm jar of king crab & butter with grilled bread, the sweet corn \"elote\" (OBSESSED), the shrimp cocktail and the hush puppies. EVERYTHING was amazing and I would order again. I actually cannot wait to come back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"It was alright.    Good service, the waitress was very friendly and warm but got a bit overwhelmed when the section got busy.  No fault of her own though.    The hush puppies were probably the highlight of the night.  Fish and chips were ok, nothing special though.  The royales were alright, not memorable by any means though.  I can't quite remember what the date had, so that's probably not a good sign.    I keep trying fox restaurants but keep coming up let down.  It's just way too precocious every time, who knew that there was so many awesome lumberjacks living in the middle of the desert?  Just pretentious look howrugged/sophisticated I am, sort of vibe.  Sorry fox, I'm going to take a break.  Everyone is just trying a little too hard.  It's ridiculous.   The people here dress like they can hew down a timber stand,but don't know the difference between an axe and a wedge."}
{"text":"Bring on San Francisco, New Orleans...  you name it.  We have our own world class seafood place right here in Phoenix.  Beautiful, fresh seafood.  The ambiance is as brilliant as is the service.  The perfect mix between classy, casual and just plain old fun.  Very positive vibe.  In a market crammed with fantastic options for fine dining, we'll be back often."}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood.  Loved the oysters and char grilled octopus.  The king crab in butter cup with garlic  toast was very good.  They specialize in absinthe drinks and my wife's Monkey Gland was amazing.  Prices were reasonable!"}
{"text":"Very fresh food, nice service - love the atmosphere at the Yard, too. Lots of families, so casual for the price, but a really fun place all around. Had the Shellfish Supreme App, calm chowder, and roasted octopus appetizer. Only complaint was the bread didn't do it for me, and the chowder was good, but nothing out of this world. Everything else was great though!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great hangout as it shares a common outdoor area with about 2 or 3 other restaurants where you can play ping pong and other games.  I'd give this place a 4, but I kinda have something against their oyster prices. Even the cheap pacific oysters that were super salty came at a steep price - it was about $2-2.50 per oyster.  No thanks.   But the rest of the food we ordered was pretty good. Not stellar like, omg I'm up at 1am craving this stuff, but it was good.  I was with a group of 5 girls so we ordered (besides the oysters) a couple orders of the crab in a jar of warm butter, couple orders of corn hush puppies, frog legs, and the cajun shrimp.  I loved the frog legs, as it wasn't gamey or had a weird flavor at all.  It's marinated in a sweet fish garlic sauce that goes well with the meat but wasn't too pungent or salty.  The corn hushpuppies are semi sweet with a light sprinkle of salt on the outside - those are kind of addicting.  The crab in warm butter... I'm not sure how u can go wrong with crab and butter.  It comes with some garlic bread too that you can soak up the butter with.  And the cajun shrimp - not out of this world but the cajun flavors were good and if you ask for more bread to dip in the sauce, all will seem right in the world."}
{"text":"Great oysters; great ambient. Little Cleo's really takes you away from the hot Az heat and takes you to seaside village legions away. Multiple seaside destinations, in fact. They ship in fresh oysters from East and West, daily, so the menu is always teaming with an abundant assortment of delectable deliciousness from the ocean's bounty.    If you go, make sure to get the Maine lobster roll. And at least a dozen oysters from each coast, just to make you forget where the hell you are.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour! Can't beat 1 dollar oysters and bubbly. Been here a couple times and service can be spotty but given its happy hour and how busy they are, you have to be understanding. Overall we love this place."}
{"text":"wow! great place. interesting location in sort of a mall (the Yard) of restaurants clubs bars in phoenix. the Little Cleo's is more secluded in that it is more indoors with large windows (think fish bowl) but I am guessing to keep seafood fresher lower temperatures are mandatory.  Started with oysters and shrimp cocktail. Both were amazing! Fresh oysters, i did a mix of three  (Kumai California) and three (Kusshi British Columbia)  which were fresh and tasty!. Generous portion of shrimp cocktail with cocktail sauce, very fresh and delicious! Shortly later, a small bowl of New England Clam Chowder arrived which was very yummy even if a little heavy on the potatoes.  The decor of this restaurant was a little sterile and not very warm and inviting. The bar stools a bit firm and not quite as comfortable as they should be. Table seating a little better in terms of comfort and there is a booth which is where I want to sit next time."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of all the restaurants in the Fox Restaurant family.  So when my wife and I were in Scottsdale we decided to head over and try Little Cleo's.  We showed up closer to opening so there wasn't a wait for a table.  Like all the other restaurants in the company, the service was outstanding!  The food was also amazing - I had the fish & chips and washed it down with a Rogue Morimoto bomber.    My only complaint is that there aren't more Fox Restaurants in Texas!"}
{"text":"Popped in here after having some appetizers and drinks at Culinary Dropout/Yard. Only wanted to try the oysters as one in our party had never had them. The waitress was very accommodating and friendly given the small bill we were going to produce. Shared a dozen of the Kusshi oysters and they were excellent. I highly recommend these for anyone who hasn't tried oysters before as they have a clean flavor, no brininess and the perfect size.  I'd definitely come back here when I have a hankering for oysters, or other seafood for that matter as the menu all around looked good. And if you have a chance, sit at the counter where you can watch the chefs do their magic."}
{"text":"BEST HAPPY HOUR (if you love good $1 oysters and $2 champagne flutes).  4-6pm - EVEN ON SATURDAY (closed Sunday)!   That's all you need to know.   But also get their bouillabaise (you bet I had to spell-check that) if you need some real food."}
{"text":"5 Star restaurant. Little Cleo's has the best oysters in Arizona. All of their food is incredible - we shared some small plates, a dozen oysters, the king crab pot, clam chowder, and frog legs. The frog legs were so good we got a second order. Love this restaurant"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Little Cleo's. The majority of the party ordered from their Summer Menu which consisted of a 4-course meal for $35 which ended up being a great value. Service was 4 out of 5 stars due the majority of our group having to remind our waitress for refills. Other than that, the food was excellent and the atmosphere was very fun."}
{"text":"In there last night for dinner....waitresses kinda snarky...no Canadian whisky at bar....28.00 halibut just ok...my daughter had Bouliabasse...she liked it....  Best item was shrimp cocktail they peeled it....not a hard item to serve though....better off being more family style than gourmet....IMO"}
{"text":"Ok, Fox Restaurants are amazing, The Henry is one of my all time favorites...and now we've stumbled upon this little ocean gem! I was a little bit skeptical about the menu at first...but everything was INCREDIBLE! It's Mardi Gras week so we ordered some specials off of that menu. We had: the shrimp po boys-excellent! Alligator, which totally freaked me out at first but was delicious! The hush puppies were great and the clam chowder was also awesome! I'd have them all a again, but the real star of the show (unfortunately just part of their limited time menu) was the beignets! Holy cow, the best dessert I've ever had! If I could have those at my wedding instead of my cake, I would! You dip them into a whiskey caramel, so so so so incredible! Our server was awesome. The atmosphere is so cool and really takes you out of the desert and closer to the water! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Cleo's with the family. Love the concept of three establishments in one; Cleo's, The Yard and Culinary Dropout.  My mate and I could have gone to Cleo's while our over 21 kids could have hung out at The Yard. Well, I could have hung out at The Yard with some girlfriends. Cleo's Seafood is really good. The salmon with capers was special. It was good, through, yet moist."}
{"text":"This is a little gem which you may not expect to find in Phoenix.  We wanted oysters and celebrate last night so we thought we might try to get a seat.  We were happy to sit at the bar and felt very New Orleans like.  Great service, oysters were delish, yummy clam chowder for starters.  The crab salad to follow and then we split the Cajun Shrimp dish which was absolutely delightful with potatoes, corn on the cob, bread and giant shrimp all in this yummy Cajun sauce.  Oh and the butternut squash side dish is a MUST.  Just thinking about it all this morning is making me hungry!  Then a night cap at the bar in the Yard for some people watching and it was a perfect night.  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"If you're into seafood, this is your place. The happy hour is insane. Oysters are hit and miss in Phoenix. The oysters here are top notch, super fresh and tasty. Go during happy hour and it's $1.00 an oyster."}
{"text":"Great oyster bar in PHX! Their happy hour is the best! $1 oysters and shrimp cocktail and $2 champagne"}
{"text":"Cute place. We were seated right away on patio. Food and service was excellent. The grilled salmon over a creamy risotto was delicious. Everybody liked their meals. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but delicious. The shellfish was very fresh and the sauces flavorful. Very good seafood in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I ate here on a quiet Tuesday night. Restaurant was 20% full max. The yard and neoghboring restaurants that are part of the complex 40%...  This smaller restaurant which is part of Fox's yard is very nicely done. Its not overly large and it has a very nice open kitchen with an oyster bar etc...  Service is super friendly 6/5  Quinoa typical Fox Quinoa with added greek yogurt - yummy 5/5  Oysters tried three kind - only the expensive one was exceptional - other were on the salty side(I was warned) if you really want oysters, you may as well buy the expensive ones...they are worth it! I think they are from british columbia... they are the large honey colored ones!!  Shrimp 4/5   Salmon entree a bit fishy 3.5/5  Certified angus beef Burger didn't care for the bun nor the rings  4/5  Ny steak 3.5/5 (steak was not that special)  I did try to order the signature dish (loup de mer) but they ran out (fish) it could have made the diff to a 5 star rating?  Drinks 4/5  Strawberry ice cream dessert 4/5  This place is on the more expensive side, I would repeat, but I cannot give it a 5 star rating, just yet - like I have given many other Fox restaurants!  The Yard concept is altogether a 5 to me!"}
{"text":"I had hight hopes but got over priced, poorly mixed cocktails, over salted veggies and freezer burned king crab legs. 9 dollars for a cup(1 cup literally) of clam chowder not much better than Safeway. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner with friends!  Two of my girlfriends and myself met for dinner Saturday evening.  What a great experience, everything from the service, recommendations and the FOOD was great.  Our server Kara could not have more more pleasant, helpful and fun!  We shared 3 apps, seared octopus, crab legs in a jar and frog legs.  All outstanding.  Would highly recommend giving this cute place a chance!"}
{"text":"First ingredient in every dish is a pile of salt???... If I want salt, there's a salt shaker for that... Even the salads are salty???"}
{"text":"Wow! What an incredible spot! How have I never been here before? Great happy hour from 4-5 pm with $1 Oysters and $1 Shrimp! We also shared a few glasses of champagne for only $2! Fresh oysters, attentive and friendly staff and one of the managers (in the pink shirt) was very accommodating. Thank you Little Cleo's we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"It was good - the atmosphere is a little roudy with the adult fun house you eat at. That said, the crab legs were fresh, plentiful and the service was quite good. Glad to see there is a legit effort at creating good food in central phx."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Little Cleo's and it was as amazing as the first! We love sitting at the bar with Casey. He is incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, an amazing mixologist, and he provides the highest level of service. We just celebrated our anniversary and without a doubt we will be celebrating every special occasion with Casey at Little Cleo's. The food was amazing and the overall vibe was so uplifting. Everyone helps each other including the manager who was all over the floor touching every table to make sure everyone was happy. He was great!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  It was great to get seated in back by the yard but still inside.  ordered about 5 plates and loved everything.  get the crab in the jar it is basically a cup a butter with crab in it.........waiter was great and it was really cool to have three different places inside one location/"}
{"text":"We were treated like royalty for our anniversary dinner!  Samantha was terrific as was the crab pasta and don't miss the caramel dates and chocolate dessert!  Thanks to the mana ger also!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place! The ambiance is fantastic and the food is amazing. You can't beat the happy hour, 1$ oyster/shrimp 2$ glasses of champagne. The servers and managers are so helpful and on it. Always impressed at each visit and we try to make it a weekly thing! We had the frog legs last time something different for us, they were delicious surprise. If you haven't been there yet definitely check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ridiculously fabulous!! Seriously me and hubs came to check it out, however located inside the yard \"culinary dropout\" is this little hidden gem called little Cleo's ... Wed night it is like a female hooters with all the hot guys that eye candied for me, jazzy music, fantastic food, we are in heaven. I'll add pics!"}
{"text":"Apparently there was a mix up in which server was assigned to our table even though it was almost empty but they made it right. Went during Restaurant Week but the price was comparable to the regular menu and the portions were smaller. However, food was OUTSTANDING!! Frog legs, bouillabaisse and the sticky toffee pudding were all so tasty. We'll go back for the regular menu sometime soon."}
{"text":"Little Cleo's never lets us down. Food: amazing.  Customer service: staff is attentive, friendly, and well informed. Absolutely happy with the service.  Happy hour: $2 champagne pours and $1 oysters. Yes, please!  We had fish and chips, bouillabaisse, hush puppies, and sticky toffee for dessert. Such a lovely restaurant. Everything was delicious and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My husband, baby and I went here on an early Friday night. The neighboring Yard and Culinary Dropout were pretty crowded, but not so much so that we couldn't find a place to hang out comfortably with baby while we waited for a table. We parked ourselves into a couple of the chairs by the cornhole field. Baby loved watching the athletes play cornhole. The husband and I sipped a on a Pineapple-something beer from The San  Brewing Co. stand - it tasted better than I expected (I'm generally not the hugest fan of San Tan beers). It's noisy out there - the music coming from Culinary Dropout is insanely loud - but good cover for a talkative baby. After a 30 minute wait, we were called in for our table. The hostess and servers were very friendly. The decor was fresh, clean and inviting. We started out by ordering a dozen oysters - but the server had to check to see where the oysters were harvested from (he probably should have known that to begin with as one of this restaurant's main features is an oyster bar). The oysters were delicious and very fresh - we probably could have ordered a few dozen of these and called it a night, but we went with some small plates instead. We got the octopus, hushpuppies, king crab and scallops. Everything was executed well and tasted fresh. We were surprised to have enjoyed the hushpuppies so much. The crab and butter dish was excellent, the scallops were good and my husband really enjoyed the octopus. Are there better seafood places in this world? Yes, but Little Cleo's is pretty good for Phoenix. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Was at the bar next door for a drink when I first spotted this little gem so my husband and I decided to give it a try a few days later.   The menu is nice and small which allows the quality to be in point, and I was not disappointed at all.  We started with oysters off of the happy hour menu; just got a half dozen but they were so fresh I could have gotten 2 dozen. Ordered the garlic breed.... it was ok nothing that special and I probably wouldn't get it again unless o was with a large group of people because it was a huge serving.  I had the bouillabaisse and it was perfect in seasoning, freshness, and cook.  The bread that cane with this dish was much better than the cheesy bread and I wish that was on the menu(i like carbs obv). I basically licked the bowl. Hubby got the salmon and  although he doesn't normally order salmon because we make it at home often he said it was excellent and the presentation was great.  Had the lemon icebox pie that was a refreshing end to the meal.  The food was great. The decor is very east coast modern. But the best part was the service.  It was the most present and pleasant staff I have ever had take care of me.  What a phenomenal experience that made me really love this experience.  Cocktails were on point and had some happy hour wine too which was nice.   Definitely coming back.... my new seafood stop.  Great job!  Bring cash to tip the valet... the app to tip is kinda a pain."}
{"text":"I loved everything about my first visit here. I was thrilled to hear Fox opened a seafood concept. This definitely didn't disappoint from start to finish.  All employees-- so friendly. Love the theme of dress, definitely a nice little touch.  Appetizer; we tried the little grilled octopus-- so good. Must try, I wish I would have taken a photo.  Entrees were great... tuna & their shrimp entrée. Wine selection was awesome. I'm dying to go back with friends and try all of their little champagne starter drinks."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant.  I've been twice in less than two weeks.  The lobster roll is delicious, as well as the heirloom tomato salad.  I've tried three desserts and they were all excellent.  Had the same waitress both times and she was very good.  She recommended items from the menu and I loved all of them.  Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my fiancé on a Saturday night a few weeks ago and it was AMAZING. First, I'm a sucker for oysters and after hearing our host describe each kind, we went with the Paradise oysters. He mentioned they were a little thicker and a lot more plump than most, and they didn't disappoint. He also mentioned a new asparagus dish that wasn't even on the menu yet so we decided to be adventurous and we're happy we did. I hope it's on the menu now because it was delicious. Lastly, from start to finish the service was perfect. We didn't have just one person taking our order or bringing our drinks but since we were sitting at the bar, several members of the staff took care of us. Even the Chef came over to ask about the asparagus dish and it was obvious that they all cared about our experience. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing! I enjoyed every morsel that entered my mouth, the crab in a jar is worth NOT sharing!! :P it's too good!! My husband and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"If you like a bustling, high energy place to eat I highly suggest sitting on their patio. I was a little skeptical about it at first, but honestly I prefer to sit there. As a loud person and someone who likes to people watch, this was the perfect place to sit!!! There were plenty of heaters so we weren't cold.   We were served a four course meal which included a amuse bouche, your choose of one of three appetizers, a dinner plate, and a dessert. The amuse bouche was sea urchin with green apple. At first taste, it was delicious and fresh with the green apple. Unfortunately, the amount of salt that ended the bite was unbearable and left a bad taste in my mouth. The other people in my party had the same consensus. For my small plate, I ordered the burrata which was served with arugula and croutons. The croutons were amazing! Especially, with the burrata and arugula on top of them. Sadly, there were only three croutons and without them I got another mouthful of salt causing me to not finish my appetizer. The Chilean Sea Bass with Gnocchi was definitely the highlight of this meal. The fish was perfectly cooked and the Gnocchi complimented the Sea Bass so well! I wish I could eat this everyday. My dessert was a chocolate and espresso cake which was fine, a little underwhelming but not bad.   While, I loved the atmosphere and rate the food alright, just really salty, the service was appallingly slow. Our server and one of the managers could not have been friendlier, which was awesome, but our drinks took 20-30 minutes to get them. There were a couple times where our party all sat without drinks and that causes an unpleasant experience, especially on New Year's Eve where they should have been staffed appropriately.   Will I go back? Probably not. The slow service and the saltiness of the food was disappointing. Also, due to the wait our server brought us a shot. The GM walked by our table twice without saying anything to us. I really wish that  we would have received an apology. I was not looking for anything free, but an acknowledgement of how painfully slow the service was would have been much appreciated."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Fox Restaurants this month. The \"bacon\" (sturgeon) and eggs appetizer was excellent. (See photo). The Halibut and grilled ahi were very good but the servings are pretty small. We saw the main lobster roll also and it was a pretty big roll with not a lot of lobster. Overall all good food but not too filling. See photo for list of Happy hour drinks"}
{"text":"Teddy was fantastic guiding us through the menu. Very attentive to our needs. Tasty cocktails and DELICIOUS food. Great atmosphere, a bit noisy - but it is an open kitchen so it is to be expected."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this based on a private event we held at Little Cleo's where we rented out the entire space, so not a typical night at the restaurant.   We worked with Keri and Lexie as coordinators for the event, and they were so pleasant to work with. Extremely responsive, thorough, and really listened to our needs and adjusted our plans as such. We had a tough situation - tight budget with a lot of people with different needs (vegetarian, non-seafood, etc) and they accommodated everything we needed.  We arrived with 61 people all at once and were immediately greeted with a well laid out space, the right amount of staff, and booze set out and ready to go. They had printed custom menu's and immediately began taking our orders. The service was impeccable - so nice, appropriately staffed, and all over our drinks and food orders.  The food came out in waves, which I expected given the size of our group. The entrees took a little while for some tables, but overall it was okay since the drinks were flowing and the appetizers came out really quickly. All of the food was really well cooked - I had the seafood chowder, steak entrée, and we all had the fritters for dessert. The food was delicious - and I consider myself a bit of a foodie. I would definitely come back and trust ordering anything off the menu. Others had the kale salad, tuna, and chicken dish (we were working off a prix fixe menu) and I heard zero complaints.  The Yard is also a nice area to hang out in, and coincidentally other co-workers were at a neighboring restaurant at the same time, so we got to all hang out and play games later.  Net/net - they took excellent care of our high maintenance group, and I would go back there in a heart beat with any size group on any size budget."}
{"text":"Little Cloe's   Guess what this cost? If u guessed $122 dollars you guessed right!  Oh yeah we had the muscles and two glasses of wine. Guess how long it took to get the appetizers? 51 minutes to get raw muscles serve to you.  - Ahi tuna $27 that's the one on the right.  - Bouillabaisse scallop muscle and shrimp $24   Obviously not meant to go however if you need it to go because someone in your party got sick it's served to you in a 9 x 9 Styrofoam container and looks like this when you get home. As for the atmosphere, don't expect to sit outside and receive above average dining priced at $30 plus a dish. You're seated next to a college fraternity party and a 25-year-old party playing ping-pong drinking keg beer... don't mean to knock the yard at culinary drop out because I absolutely love it. I'm just pissed I didn't go there first.  I have to complement the GM for taking care of me after I got home, cool dude! Thanks Daniel!   Anyway one of the poorest Fox Concepts ive ever been to and I will never ever go back."}
{"text":"Okay this place is good. No I mean really good.  It is a Fox restaurant so you know the service is top notch but the food omg.  Did I say this place was good.  Maybe I should stop now before too many people show up. This is easily Fox's best and that says a lot.  Oh yea did I say this place is good."}
{"text":"Set in The Yard, this oyster and absinthe bar seems like a nice find. Decor is swanky 20s, maybe. Hubs and I were seated outside, next to the Yard play area. It was 108 outside, but the plentiful misters made this setting very pleasant. Waiter arrived promptly and we orderly swiftly....menu is short so we picked out drinks and food items quickly. Then it went down hill. We were there on the 4th of July, so I wonder if the usual kitchen and wait staff were away. The drinks took forever to arrive. They tried to give us someone else's food 3 different times. Then our own food took forever. We got fish and chips...hard to screw those up. The side of spinach was really excellent. The asthinthe drink I had was very good. 3 stars for the crazy service. They did comp the drinks and give us 25 percent off our food though. Yay."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here instead of waiting an hour for culinary drop out and were not disappointed.   We were seated immediately and I asked for recommendations for what to get. Our server    told us about the scallops for an appetizer, the bouillabaisse and the grass fed New York strip. My boyfriend ordered a drink and we ordered everything she recommended.   His drink arrived and he told me to take a sip. I couldn't identify what was in it by taste but it was very citrusy. He ordered the Subtle menace which had gin, wine and absinthe. It was pretty smooth for having all of that in it.   The scallops were interesting. I've never tasted anything like it or can compare it to anything I've tasted. They were good to try but I wouldn't get them again.   Our entrees arrived and the portions looked rather small (compared to what I expected for the price) but was delicious! The New York strip was cooked to perfection and was fuchsia pink unlike at other steaks that sometimes tend to be bloody and runny. My dish had an abundance of flavors and we finished every bite. In the end the portions were the perfect size. You didn't walk out of there hating yourself or on the edge of a food coma.     The wait staff were all very friendly and the vibe of the place feels casual. Don't come here if you're trying to eat light!"}
{"text":"This place gets packed quite often so expect to bring cash to tip the valet! This place is so aesthetically pleasing inside and outdoor seating. The marble tables and the white tiled walls make it very fitting. I would have never expected to enjoy good seafood like this living in the desert. I went during happy hour aka the best hour since is $1 oysters and shrimp. I ordered a dozen oysters and it looked so appetizing. The garlic wedge fries were also a great side but you gotta try the hush puppies. Slightly crunchy and soft. I'm definitely going to be going here much more often."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fantastic. The sturgeon bacon, frog legs, and fish have great flavor. Best oysters on town. The bouillabaisse should be a national treasure."}
{"text":"Met up with east coast foodie friends here for happy hour. Parking is no longer much of an issue for The Yard area since the new parking area opened. I had the good fortune of being able to take advantage of their summer happy hour offers, which included $1 oysters - I ordered a dozen of those; they were fresh, deliciously briny and came with mignonette and cocktail sauces. I also tried their warm, delectable sweet corn hush puppies and washed those down with a few champagne pours (again, summer happy hour specials at $2 a pour). The restaurant itself is spacious and has an airy look about it, especially with the open kitchen where you can see the kitchen staff busily preparing the orders. The wait staff is warm and friendly and definitely helped make this visit there really pleasant."}
{"text":"$1 oyster happy hour!!! This place is great! We have had just about every thing on the menu and it's all fantastic! The service is always great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband loved the oysters. No complaints. Food and service was awesome. Food was spectacular some of the best seafood we had."}
{"text":"Service was super friendly and watching the staff was like watching a ballet. We started with oysters then shared 5 plates: scallops, corn elote, frogs legs, octopus, sturgeon. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is located in the yard and connected to culinary drop out. I love the feel of this establishment it's casual rustic modern decor. The food was awesome! Crispy frog legs, oysters, squid ink pasta with muscles, roasted Brussels sprouts with white truffle aoli deishhhh!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the good fortune of experiencing this place during restaurant week -- probably wouldn't have ventured out otherwise. I had the frog legs, which really did taste like chicken, cajun shrimp, red potato, corn & grilled bread, and for dessert a bite of the infamous donuts (too much sugar for me). Everything was heavenly. For the entree, I would have loved more veggies but it was a meat and potato kinda dish, lol. For the frog legs, after a few bites, I didn't feel guilty anymore, lol. I was like frog.. I can't eat frog, but alas I was wrong.  The restaurant was so cute and the open kitchen was actually inviting. Some kitchens, I'd rather not see. The service was impeccable and the waiters had personalities! Would totally go back."}
{"text":"Limited menu choices. The small plates should be called really small plates - less than 10 pieces of calamari to be more specific. We felt they were pricey for the portion sizes. The New England Clam Chowder  was too thin. Not up to par with other Fox restaurants although the atmosphere on the patio was fun people watching."}
{"text":"Excellent food and rich. Service perfect. Walk away full and happy. Expensive. No drinks, four small plates and two deserts and tip $99.00.  Very good though."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on the Fit for Foodies rating on Open Table. Cute decor, interesting menu (all seafood). Location is within the Yard/Culinary Dropout complex.we started with Kumamoto oysters which were tasty, but had a little shell in it. Mignonette made with apple cider vinegar was too sweet. I had the King crab in butter pot. Tasty, but probably didn't need the truffle oil. I actually like the butter proteins, which were not served. My husband had the bouillabaisse which was delicious. Overall we would come back. Server was cute, and very earnest."}
{"text":"Damnit!!!!! I fricking love this place!  And, they took the best appetizer in all of Phx, Scottsdale and beyond- the scallop crudo and changed it!! Why, why, why??? It was perfect!!!!!!! The new one is sooo boring!    The saving grace, the Bouillabaisse was sent from heaven!  The perfectly prepared seafood to the charred bread is pure heaven!   Please bring back the Crudo please!"}
{"text":"This might be my new seafood Phoenix favorite! Certainly the best Happy Hour place in the valley. The atmosphere is inviting and reminds me of a New England restaurant. The staff is attentive and very pleasant. I had $2 champagne pours and $1 oysters! Fresh and good. Can't wait to bring my friends here soon."}
{"text":"Two stars might be a little low but I expected much more from Mr. Fox. We regularly visit many of his restaurants and Little Cleo's was a little disappointing. My wife and I ate dinner on a very busy Saturday night on the patio in July. Though the weather is no fault of Little Cleo's we were sweating nonstop through the whole meal until we finally decided to move inside to the bar.   We both elected for the summer special. Four courses and I had the wine pairing. The service was okay, the staff was friendly and really busy. The oysters and shrimp cocktail were good but nothing that you can't get anywhere else for half the price. The frog legs were good but I felt the novelty of them was the biggest selling point. Grilled octopus was really good. Loupe de mer was nice and the seafood boullabaise was as good as any I've ever had elsewhere. The wine pairing was overly priced and not that well paired. One came out 15 minutes before the course so I drank most of it by the time the food arrived. The other two pairings were fine but in hindsight I would have rather ordered one glass for the meal at half the price and less laborious. Our desserts were excellent. Beignets and buttermilk pie!  Overall we felt like we were paying for the Fox brand. Next time we will go elsewhere for seafood but we still enjoy many other Fox concepts."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The oysters were spot on and you can't beat the happy hour prices. The hush puppies are definite must. Can't go wrong with any of the deserts."}
{"text":"Lots of good things to say some things not so good Went their last night as we had heard good things Big backup at valet as this restaurant is located in the highly successful fox venue called the yard The reception staff was very friendly and seated us at the counter. Ordered a couple of cocktails which came in puny glasses. This place could learn a few things about cocktail service!  Server who was also very nice told us they were out of lobster roll (at 6:30!?) My wife ordered the crab salad and I ordered the seafood stew without mussels please Crab salad had a minuscule helping of crab Stew was great but they forgot to hold the mussels. Luckily my wife likes mussels  She said they were exceptionally small All in all I would recommend this place but come early and get the lobster roll as it is obviously a big hit Sam Fox knows his stuff but like so many of his restaurants the total act is lacking"}
{"text":"I was this close to five star review, but alas just not enough to put this Sam Fox creation over the top.  That said, this is unquestionably the best Fox restaurant I've patronized to date.  Excellent service, great ambiance, and super tasty food.  As with other Fox restaurants, the prices are a little out of line.  But this one was close.  My Mom had a Fox gift card and was looking to try a Fox spot she hadn't tried before.  I've been to the Yard numerous times, but never set foot next door into Little Cleo's.  Seeing mostly positive reviews about this place, we gave it a try.  Its a small spot located within a small Fox megaplex of restaurants on 7th St between Bethany and Missouri.  Across the way from the Yard and around the corner from Culinary Dropout, is a smaller more refined restaurant called Little Cleo.  Inside the restaurant is an open kitchen that backs up to the Oyster bar with restaurant style seating on the perimeter.  We opted for restaurant seating with a view of The Yard.  My Mom had actually never been to this complex before so it was quite a lot for her to take in.  My Mom and I were both hungry so we started with their shrimp cocktail.  For $14, we got 8 jumbo shrimp with cocktail sauce that went heavy on the horseradish.  Good shrimp and the sauce had a pretty good kick.  We also split some garlic potato fries with aioli sauce.  I'm pretty sure I've had these exact same fries at The Henry, but they were good nonetheless and perfect for sharing at $5.    For a main course, my Mom went with the King Crab salad which was basically a BLT salad with crab laced in there.  My Mom said it was good, but we both agreed they probably shorted her on the crab a bit.  For $16 she probably should've gotten at least a few more good chunks of crab to spread throughout the salad.  For my dish, I went with the one dish seemingly everyone on Yelp has been talking about.  The $24 Bouillabaisse.  Basically a cioppino with scallops, mussels, shrimp, veggies, and spices.  The fish were all cooked perfectly and soaked up that broth.  Oh man, that broth was heavenly.  All the richness you'd expect and more.  Thankfully the bowl included some bread that I could use to soak up the broth.  And you better believe I spooned up every last drop of that broth out of the bowl.  We decided to cap off the night by splitting their beignets.  Because, well why not.  Only these beignets came with caramel to dip in.  Not overloaded with sugar like Cafe du Monde's beignets, but plenty of powdered sugar on those babies to be sure.  Those beignets were without question my Mom's favorite dish of the night.    When all was said and done, total price for the shrimp cocktail, fries, main courses, dessert, three glasses of wine, tax and tip came out to $130.  Like I said, Fox isn't cheap and to be fair I knew this place was on the more expensive end (even for Fox).  I actually feel the Bouillabaisse was priced fairly for what I got, but the king salad and shrimp cocktail were priced way too high for what we got.  Still, our server was excellent, the aesthetics were cool, and the food was quite delicious.  If you're looking to try this place but looking to save a little, I might recommend coming here during Arizona Restaurant Week in May and September.  They typically discount their menu at least a few bucks and sometimes will throw in a freebie.    There are only so many good seafood spots to find in the valley.  Little Cleo's is certainly among the better ones, though some pricing moderation would probably propel this place to become among the best in town."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great set up. Really difficult to find as it's part of culinary drop out but did have complimentary valet parking. Would recommend the poke bowl!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week and it was phenomenal! Service was great and food was delicious!  Apps - Frog legs - simply mind blowing. Can I get a larger bucket please? Grilled octopus - so tender it melts in your mouth. Some of the best I've ever had King crab jar - large jar of king crab and butter what's not to like about it? It is pricey but worth the splurge. Only complaint is the jar is top heavy so be careful because it gets messy when you spill.   Entrees Albacore tuna - very tasty and creative. Wanted/needed more of the steak sauce Fish and Chips - HUGE portion of perfectly crispy fish! It was the favorite.  Bouillabaisse - perfectly cooked seafood in a delicious broth. No complaints here!   Dessert Buttermilk pie - So GOOD makes you want to smack your mama.  Donuts - I could eat these donuts on a daily basis with that caramel apple butter. AND they give you the entire donut (donut and hole).   I will definitely be putting this place on the restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I've been looking forward to eating here for so long and I was not that impressed. The food and service were just ok. They were out of almost everything we wanted to try at 8:30 on a Saturday. How can you be such a busy place and run out of French fries on a Saturday night?  Husband had oysters before I arrived. I hate them anyway but he said they were amazing. We had a variety of drinks and they were good.  We loved the scallop crudo and the crab in a jar is definitely amazing. The frog legs were good too. I sent back the lobster bisque. Probably the worst I've ever had (I'm used to the one at T Cooks and Joe's Stone Crab). Husband loved the bouillabaisse but I wasn't impressed.  We felt ignored most of the time and there weren't that many people at the bar most of the time.  I feel like I should give this a higher rating because some of the food was great but, overall, my high expectations were not met. I think this is most photos I've taken for a meal I hope to never repeat."}
{"text":"Slowly losing track of how many times I've visited here. Doesn't really matter. All I can say is that they impress me more and more every time my wife and I eat here. This time we brought some friends along, one of them a \"foodie\". He loved his meal, his wife, a little more on the cautious side enjoyed her meal, and even got a little experimental herself. If you've never been here, and you don't know what to try, it's hard to go wrong with anything, but I have a hard time not making the (sp?) boulliabaise my go-to meal. If you've never had frog-legs, and are even the tiniest bit curious, you MUST try them. If you love chicken-wings, you will love these. The crab-jar is icing on the cake... The desert portion is small, but is always really good. (I was running out of room anyways.)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was totally awesome! The food was OMG but a little expensive, but totally worth it! It was my first time at the Yard and I would have loved to stay.  If you are looking at reviews because you haven't been here yet, the restaurant is connected to two other restaurants that have a courtyard area that is covered. Hence the name, the Yard. I thought having three restaurants connected to each other would be a dealbreaker. However each restaurant to separate and unique and it is a great idea. I look forward to going back and trying out the other restaurants as well and hanging out."}
{"text":"O...M...G. Very rarely do I have such a good experience that I can't stop thinking about how great a place is hours after I left. Pretty neat spot inside The Yard, around the corner. I wasn't sure about having oysters again as my first experience wasn't the greatest, but I'm so glad I did!   First of all my friend and I were greeted by a lovely gentlemen wearing an argyle sweater, told us we could sit anywhere since it wasn't that busy (we went on a Monday evening). We had so many questions about the menu and about each type of oysters. He was very educated about the east coast vs. west coast oysters and how they differ. Everything seemed gibberish, but he simplified it for me and suggested we try one of each to be able to differentiate. They were all freakin awesome, came with some special sauce and cocktail sauce. I could now have oysters for my full meal. Delicious.   After a few oysters, we decided to get the scallop small plate, shishito peppers, and fries which came with an aioli dipping sauce. And then ordered more oysters.   Highly recommend if you love seafood!!!"}
{"text":"My assistant attempted to make a reservation for 13 people for this upcoming Tuesday, 4 Nov. After being told that for a party above 10, then later 8 he would need to contact a manager and then the manager was not available, and we needed to sign contracts and provide credit card guarantees, he came to me for advise.  I was truly disappointed as the reviews are great and I´m hosting a meeting for people flying form Mexico and South Carolina.  I however have limits and after hearing the sequence of events decided to go elsewhere.  I cannot imagine risking this level of service for my business guests if we overcame all of the many obstacles and managed to secure a reservation. I hope everyone that enjoys the food at this venue enjoy it quickly since their business practices of loosing 13 business customers on a Tuesday evening cannot last forever.  A real shame for them as I found a different seafood restaurant with very good Yelp ratings that was pleased to accommodate us 13 guests.  I´m certain that we will have an enjoyable time over dinner where not only the food is good but the level of customer service and good business sense prevail.  Perhaps, the person attending to this request is a new employee and did not have all of his senses working this past Friday, but I can only blame the management team for not staying on top of all the details, the key to long term success!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is amazing. Lobster roll, brussels sprouts are the best I have ever had. The crab in a jar is a must!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night at Little Cleo's.  The warm crab dip in butter with grilled bread was outstanding!! Sadly my husband ordered the king crab legs. He didn't think they were prepared well and didn't eat them and asked that they be sent back. No one from the management came to inquire why he didn't like them and he was still charged the 38.00 for them.  Not a way to treat your customers if you want them to return!!"}
{"text":"Awesome oyster bar, especially @ happy hour when they are $1 each. Always plenty of choices and super fresh.  Also $1 shrimp - yum!  Other items, such as crab, lobster rolls, and cheese bread are equally good. Really nice vibe with great music. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars. I would give them 0 stars. I was very dissatisfied with the customer service. I ate the food and enjoyed it. It was awesome. The server and manager leaves me to never return. I arrived first to the establishment to ensure we could get a table for the big party that we had. They told me I needed to make reservations and couldn't accommodate. I waited outside for my party to arrive and watch as empty tables remained empty with no one to sit there. I would hate to pull out the race card. But I felt discriminated against. Needless to say I went next door where we got a much better experience. The staff and manager was the best. The food and drinks were even better."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good seafood in the dessert! Raw oysters flown in daily. Sweet corn hush puppies & Buttermilk pie...wow! Attentive staff. Open kitchen."}
{"text":"I met some friends here for dinner tonight and we had a great evening!  The service was welcoming, friendly and helpful with recommendations.  The decor was simple, yet classy - love the open kitchen concept!  The blood orange and pineapple royale was dangerously delicious...could have indulged in more than one for sure!  We decided to share a bunch of small plates and all were fantastic - grilled octopus, blue crab toast, shrimp cocktail, hush puppies, quinoa salad and roasted artichokes.  It was a great way to sample a good portion of the menu, so highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Let me see where to start this review...saw Little Cleo's as a cute and charming place to eat my beloved oysters. It sort of looked like the quintessential oyster bar Taylor's Shellfish in Seattle. So, great start! Cute inside? Check. Reservation at 7 pm, showed up 20 minutes early? Check. Let me tell you about how me and my friend were treated. We were told it would be at our set reservation time to be seated and to take a seat at the bar while we waited. Needless to say, the hostess forgot about us! So around 7:15 I tell her, she then says \"ohhhhh. Right. I need to set your table.\" We're then seated, and informed that all the oysters are sold out. Mind you.... They opened at 5 for dinner. For national oyster day. That they advertised. Super disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Excellent ambience! Excellent service and love the vibe! Fish and chips were delicious! Beer batter and fresh!"}
{"text":"I went here for my anniversary with my boyfriend. We were a little confused at first since it's basically a restaurant inside a restaurant,  however once you get inside you wouldn't even notice.  You feel like you're in a high class fish market on the eastern seaboard.   Our waiter offered us recommendations,  and sadly we are not oyster fans but that's what they are known for. Instead we started with octopus which was tender and perfectly spicy. We both loved it and cleaned the plate.   We both got fish for our mains and they were perfect. The salmon was grilled with a nice crust and seasoned just right.  All the accompaniments just added to it."}
{"text":"Warm jar king crab, holy crap that's good.  Atmosphere was nice, good music.  Pricy but worth it. Great food, very nice service."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best seafood in Arizona. Every single thing from the appetizers to the main courses to the deserts are delicious. Even the oysters are great and I have never had good oysters unless I'm in a coastal area.  Friendly service and great ambiance as well."}
{"text":"The whole restaurant is super friendly , especially waitresses Channel , she helped us explaining the menu fully detailed , she should be the manager there ,  the way she set up the table is so detailed each seating , and very efficient ! Gets all our order right ( we have 7 people ) and perfect attentive service , now let's talk about the food , Mainly seafood , with open style restaurant excellent choices of sauces and oyster from diff places ,  I order the seabads. And miso cod , excellent flavors , very fresh both dishes , the king crab salad is also good with mix of salad dressing ! Overall this is the place I would go again next time I am in here !"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Like the atmosphere.  Reason for poor rating is value.    The food is pretty outrageously priced for what you get.  Jar of king crab is like $4 of king crab in a small jar of butter with toasted bread, for $21.  The clam chowder is the smallest cup of chowder I have ever seen served.  Seriously.  Like 6 ounces of chowder that is only marginally better than you get in a can.  For $9.   Another thing is they hype the happy hour, but don't put hours on the board advertising it.  So you come in at 5:30 when every place under the sun has happy hour, and they tell you it's between 4:01 and 4:05pm.    Okay, that's an exaggeration.  It's between 4-5.  So what IS great here?  Frog legs.  Best frog legs you can find on the west coast.  Seriously.  You can't come here and not order them.    Sauteed spinach at $5 is a bargain, with tasty sauce.  Banana tart is pretty tasty for desert.    For entrees, I think best value/taste/execution is the Bouillabaisse.  It's almost worth what they charge for it.  I like Little Cleo's enough to come here every 1-2 years, and enjoy a nice meal with my family.  I just wish the prices were 25% less."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, and the atmosphere is brilliant.  I wish i have discovered this little gem a little earlier.  It is located at The Yard which is in itself is a great concept with Culinary Drop out sharing a commute out door area.    We ordered the oyster shooters to start, i personally wasn't really into oyster to begging with but thru the suggestion of our server we were able to pick out a medium size more buttery flavor oyster with their signiture home made cocktail sauce, and it was a success! LOVED IT!  And we ordered the crispy froglegs, it is unique and flavorful, the way i could discribe how it taste would be a combination between \"fine chicken tenderloin with catfish\" (quote from the manager Casey), and it is excatly how it taste like.    I had the king crab legs as my main course and my better half had the bouillabaisse.  i would defnitely recommend both entreys .  And for dessert we had the five spice pumpkin fritters, which was amazing, fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.    over all i give it a 4 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service! If you want a chill atmosphere while eating good food, come here. It's like eating at a buddy's house with fancy food. A MUST-TRY is the jar of crab & butter. If you die from all the butter intake the next day, it doesn't matter because it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice place, did a little sampling, can't wait to go for a full meal.  The Yard in general is super cool."}
{"text":"I thought Little Cleo's had the best seafood that I have tasted in the Valley.  Excellent shrimp, wonderful oysters, fantastic King Crab legs.  The coleslaw was nothing to write home about, but after the wonderful appetizers and main dish, it was fine.  The desserts were fine too."}
{"text":"Went there with family during Restaurant Week since there are not many seafood options in this desert we call Arizona. No comparisons to SF fisherman wharf or San Diego or to Boston seafood eateries. We had reservations and came bit early. As we waited they do have some games (ping pong etc) and thought I can play a game with my son. Was told no kids allowed in the game side. So that is a bummer. I guess they only want adults and not families to come out to this location. Once seated, some of the things we wanted to order were not available, so second bummer. My son did try frog legs so that is something new. Other than that nothing to brag about. Good experience to try out few things. Since there is not a whole lot in seafood section in Phoenix, probably come back in a year or two."}
{"text":"This place gets high marks for every category: ambience, wait staff, diversified menu, drink selection, and finally food quality.   Little Cleo's indoor/outdoor patio faces The Yard, a genius oversized patio custom designed for a fun time. With everything from ping pong tables to corn hole, there's always a big crowd and Little Cleo's offers the perfect vantage point.   The wait staff was all very amiable, knowledgable, and adorably dressed. Our waitress, although I didn't catch her name, stood out with her red and blonde dyed hair and exceptional service. She was so friendly and every single suggestion she gave was fantastic.   The menu is unique, with so many options we'll have to go a few more times to cover it all. We started off with the sweet corn hush puppies--get them!! Had to send back the clam chowder upon discovering it had bacon in it (not stated on the menu). No other issues though, and everything else was delicious. We sampled a half dozen oysters that were fresh and distinctly flavorful. The warm king crab in a jar with butter and grilled bread was interesting. It tasted good but very rich. Good appetizer to share. The romanesco and broccolini salad was by far the most unique and enjoyable dish. I did however leave with a stomach ache, although I suspect this was due to the blending of various rich foods.   Get a drink from their \"Royals\" selection. All specialty cocktails with a sparkling wine base. I particularly loved the grapefruit and elderflower.  Made for a great date night. Will definitely be back in the near future!!"}
{"text":"An exceptional night out! A birthday family night and the best food. Soft shell crab was in season and that was a wonderful surprise. excellent service. As good as it could be. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is not your typical mainstream, middle of the road Fox place.  Its creative spins on classics are a welcome addition to the Phoenix dining scene.  Enjoy the open kitchen and sit at the bar.  Favorites include: - hush puppies: (they're not kids wear) fried but not greasy  - sturgeon \"bacon\" & eggs - bouillabaisse - beignets with caramel whiskey dipping sauce:  watch out Cafe du Monde!"}
{"text":"Came here with the hubby for date night, there isn't a lot of parking but you do have the option to valet. This area does get very busy too so don't just expect to find street parking.  Little Cleo's is not the smallest restaurant I've been too but I would consider it on the smallish side. You have the option of sitting inside or outside. I enjoyed sitting inside because they have a beautiful open kitchen.   We started off with drinks and I got the grapefruit and elderflower royale which was light and refreshing.  We ordered the bouillabaisse and a shrimp Po boy both were very delicious I would definitely order both again  The servers were friendly and accommodating I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I just discovered my new favorite restaurant. Everything was simply well put together.  Interior is very unique, good selection of music, attentive server. The spirit of the absinthe era was truly present.. (pun intended) watch how they prepare it.   I was very happy with the Food and drinks: we had lots of absinthe, royales cocktail - oh so good! I think it is just great to seat at the bar and watch the guys in the kitchen.  Corn hush puppies - the sauce could be less salty, but it's a good starter Seared Tuna - amazing.  Squid ink pasta with mussels - pretty good, very venetian. (they make the pasta there) Beignets and coffee were a nice finish.  We had so much fun.   In some earlier reviews I read people complained that the beignets and coffee are a far cry from those at  Cafe Du Monde. Dude... you are in phoenix... and it is not a chain restaurant.   will be back, despite valet parking."}
{"text":"Awesome seafood is a wonderful thing.  They have the best oysters I've had in Arizona with clear liquor and sea water essence.  It goes great with a glass of bubbles.  The other stand out dish was the \"bacon & eggs\" house made sturgeon bacon, creme fraiche & toast*.  Black out good!  Before this dish fish bacon was absolutely foreign to me, but after eating this, I'm completely hooked!  They are having a $55 6 course dinner on their website that I'm thinking about doing with the wife.  On top of all of this the beers were cold, and the service was on point.  This is where the good stuff lives."}
{"text":"The food was ok but it was very loud there. Could not carry on a conversation. Yes we are outside but they need to decide what they want to be. If you want to be known for fresh high quality seafood don't provide a low quality environment."}
{"text":"This entire experience was excellent.  We pulled up had complimentary valet and then walked into an open space 3 restaurant extravaganza.  We choice Little Cleos.  The bartender Sam was Amazing.  We were immediately acknowledged and served water and our drink of choice.  The kitchen is open to your veiw so you see how fresh your food is  and how it's made.  We got the kale salad and Barrata salad...the garlic cheese bread...all amazingly delicious and fresh.  Then we ordered the fish tacos and the boullianase.  SO delicious.  The restaurant is so quaint...with its white subway tile...stainless steel and the staff was top notch.  Oldies play in the background.  An amazing chill vibe....don't pass it up!!"}
{"text":"The food is gourmet at its finest! The staff is upbeat, very welcoming, and fantastic!!  The atmosphere is like sensory overload for your eyes cause there's so much you want to look at.    Upon arriving I was greeting by a few upbeat people at the hostess station.  One gentleman asked if I'd been there before and when I said I hadn't he gave me a personal tour.  Who does that?    I believe I got this correct but please don't quote me just in case ;)  The Yard consists of Culinary Dropout (bar and gaming type environment), Little Cleo's Seafood Legend (seafood restaurant) and Barrio Urbano (street tacos).  There's basically a big open space that includes a bar section, gaming section with ping pong, foosball, skeeball, etc, the street taco restaurant (Barrio Urbano), and a seafood restaurant (Little Cleo's).  It's so big that there may even be sections that I'm not aware of!! They have high top tables, low tables, couches, patio chairs, cushiony single chairs, coffee tables, fire pits, and it's huge so you're not sitting on top of anyone!!  The largest area is Culinary Dropout then the restaurants are sectioned off but with an open space décor.  It doesn't matter where you sit, you can still see everything.    After visiting the Culinary Dropout, I moseyed on over to Little Cleo's some delectable seafood. I opted for small dishes since I filled up on those friggin' pretzels from Culinary Dropout.  We ordered and shared Sweet Corn Hushpuppies, Ahi Tuna Tartare, King Crab w/ Butter & Grilled Bread, Butternut Squash Gratin and the King Crab salad.  I'd never had Sweet Corn Hushpuppies so this was my first experience.  I'm not a big fried food girl so wasn't sure how I was going to feel about them.  Amazing!!  Not sure if all hush puppies taste like that but I will try them again.  The Ahi Tuna Tartare was a nice size chunk of tuna in a cucumber shell.  The tuna was fresh so it melted in your mouth.  The fresh tuna with the coolness from the cucumber and freshness from tuna made for a delicious appetizer.  The king crab with butter and grilled bread is absolutely addicting! It was served in a jar with melted butter.  The crab pieces were large in size and mouthwatering. The Butternut Squash Gratin...outstanding!!!  It was sweet in taste similar to a sweet potato but not really.  It's nearly impossible to describe the taste but I can tell you it was creamy and smooth.  Since I'm not a big sweet potato type person you would think I wouldn't like it if someone described it.  It was the best dish I had at this restaurant.  As for the King Crab salad, I wasn't a big fan of it.  I felt it was particular smaller than the salads I'm used to in Los Angeles, which would have been fine but I didn't feel there was enough substance.  There seemed to be a lot of lettuce and very little of everything else.  If you're looking for a small salad to have for yourself as an appetizer than this salad may be the perfect thing.    Every single employee that I interacted with was friendly, catered to my every whim with delight and helpful when making selections.  I've dealt with servers at other places that never really tell you what their favorite menu item is.  Instead, they'll make comments such as, \"everything is great.\"  I like details, people.  What is your favorite, and why does it stand out so much?  The people I interacted with at The Yard were excellent and have exceptional customer service skills!!     I wish The Yard was in my area because you couldn't get me to leave.  I'm saddened that a dear friend moved to Phoenix but now I have 2 reasons to go visit. I am confident I will visit The Yard on every single time I visit Phoenix.  I love that place!!  Just the thought of this place makes me crave the Butternut Squash Gratin."}
{"text":"First visit!  Happy hour at the bar!  I have never liked oysters at other place but this place has me sold!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Summer 4 course special for $35.00.  I received OUTSTANDING food and service but was slightly disappointed because my main course plate was not enough food to feed an anorexic. If you take the time to look at my photo you can see the fish I received is only 2-3 ounces of fish with a very small amount of vegetables. Much less food than a diet lunch for a woman.   Order the grilled loup de mer if you already ate before you came here."}
{"text":"I came here last night with m'lady and two of our closest 'foodie' friends and I must say, we were very impressed with Little Cleo's. The new gem of the Sam Fox empire lived up to my expectations and then some in terms of ambiance, service, and quality of food.  Walking in, the restaurant is small..ish, with seating at tables and bar stools. The first thing I noticed are the oysters - boom - right in front of you on display and labeled from location. After settling in, you start to get a 'San Francisco' type vibe in the atmosphere with the 40's music, white tiles, open kitchen, etc. (dare I say it - I know Bay Area natives will probably turn up their noses at that as they do for every thing else).  You absolutely cannot come here without getting the oysters, don't even think about it. Second, do you like crab? Well, they have a \"Warm jar of King Crab and butter with grilled bread\" - verbatim, that is what it says on the menu. I want to die eating a warm jar of king crab and butter, that is how good it was. Lastly, you have to get the frog legs. Don't be a wuss, sack up and eat them. They are delicious, super tender, and have an incredible Thai chili sauce. We ate everything family style, I recommend you do the same.  Top all of it off with great service from our server Casey and you have a fantastic seafood dining experience in Phoenix. Oh, and don't forget to buy the kitchen a beer for $2 before you leave."}
{"text":"We adore everything about little Cleos.   The wait staff (Kelly) is super considerate and on top of everything.  The food is to die for.  The cup of crab in butter with grilled toastettes bread is something I  would sell my kidney for.  Love the choice of seating indoors or out in the courtyard.  Decor inside has a very cool vibe.  Don't eat all my food when you go tho!"}
{"text":"We love the place.  Good trendy atmosphere with the best seafood in Phoenix.  Then crab in butter is great . Inside and outside seating. Try the absinthe and they have excellent wine on tape.  It is not cheap but there is none better in Arizona."}
{"text":"Checked this place out.  Cute atmosphere but not impressed with the food for the money.  King crab soaked in truffle butter is super rich.  Menu doesn't state truffle oil so if I had known I would not have ordered it.  Allergic to truffle oil.  Got super sick."}
{"text":"I went for happy hour with the boyfriend and the choice of oysters and the way they cooked their shrimp for their shrimp cocktail was fantastic. The customer service was fantastic and very attentive."}
{"text":"We were seated a minute before our reservation the Friday before Valentine's Day, so I felt as if we were starting off on the right foot. Parking was the toughest part of our downtown area date night. I had a glass of the Malbec she had the Riesling, they were both outstanding.   Then we moved on to appetizers, we did the Crab in the jar, which as big time seafood lovers we thought it was simply to DIE for. We also has the Bacon and Eggs Crustini as our second appetizer, which also was done skillfully.   On to Entrées, she had the squid ink pasta with mussels, she let me know those were the best mussels she's ever had which is a big deal because we've done mussels from San Diego to Seattle, Boston to Arizona. I had the seared Ahi tuna with dumplings and spicy soy reduction, which was beyond outstanding. Our meal was ridiculously great.   Our experience at Little Cleo was wonderful, this place earned me some big time brownie points with my lady. There is not doubt we will be back again, most likely with family and friends. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox is brilliant at marketing. Service and food not so much.  We had a reservation but we were not seated on time.  They were out of shrimp cocktail and lobster rolls.  The pot of crab is really a pot of butter.  The kale salad is good.  The halibut was delicious.  The beignets are too dense.  The staff didn't know what type of fish was in the fish and chips or the difference between east and west coast oysters.   It's expensive for what you get.  Paper napkins at this price point????"}
{"text":"Valentines Day! First time and last time. The food was delicious and the service wonderful. We loved the Boulibasse and New York strip! But if I'm going to spend $200+ I don't want to be sitting in uncomfortable metal chairs and feel like I'm in a cafeteria or trailer park! Too casual for the prices.....do you really think someone is going to sit at a counter and spend $$$ for dinner?  Really bummed for the long drive to have dinner."}
{"text":"We went for the happy hour special for oysters and shrimp.  The oysters were small but tasty, however the shrimp (for A DOLLAR a piece) were small - not great and not cleaned well. So a little disappointed.  Parking is crazy!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Stop wasting your time, come here first.  Like London, if you're tired of Little Cleo's you're tired of life.  Dishes you might consider:  (in order) frog legs, crab pot, squid ink pasta and mussels, boulle base, Loup de Mer.   Get here at 5pm and enjoy the place with no wait.   This is living well."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!! My boyfriend and I came here for the $1 oysters during happy hour. We feasted on oyster and then decided to venture out to the frog legs, delicious but definitely spicy, and the warm jar of crab and butter, this is a must. Everything we had was AMAZING! I can't wait to come back again and try everything we didn't get last time! The wait staff and managers were so friendly as well, loved the hospitality!"}
{"text":"My honey and I tried this place out for our date night, and we loved every bite.  Such a wonderful little spot, I loved the environment and the music.  The food was so amazing."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for a birthday celebration because of my obsession with seafood.  I haven't really found a good seafood restaurant here in the valley yet, so I was excited to try this place out after reading all of the amazing reviews.  The reviews didn't do this place justice, in case you were wondering. We started out drinking the absinthe which were recommended to us by our server and they were amazing, albeit a bit strong.  That didn't stop us from ordering many more! For a starter I ordered the AMAZING LC's Shellfish Supreme which was as incredible as it sounds.  Crab, lobster, shrimp and oysters that tasted fresh from the ocean with 3 incredible sauces.  I ended up enjoying it so much I ordered another one.  As an accompanying dish I ordered the Warm Jar of King Crab and Butter with crispy bread and I can guarantee that with each bite, the two of us enjoying this amazing concoction were making some very NSFW noises. My husband had the fish and chips because he is not really a seafood fan, but is very critical of the fish and chips, because it is one of his favorite meals.  Apparently they did it right because he was also making some NSFW noises while eating it.  He was sad that there wasn't very many fries, but the amazing flavor of the fish and the coleslaw made up for it. The other member of our party who didn't partake of our amazing Shellfish Supreme (until I ordered the 2nd one) ordered the bouillabaisse which he all but licked the bowl clean.  Between the amazing flavor of the alcohol to the fresh and delicious seafood I can definitely say that I will be returning as often as the pocketbook can handle it.  Prices were a bit steep, but the quality more than made up for it.   Thank you Little Cleo's for an amazing birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"It would've been perfect to come for happy hour for $1 oysters and $1 shrimp and half off absinthe cocktails and $2 champagne pours. It's the stuff \"foodie dreams\" are made of. However, we didn't because it was from 4-5pm and our friend's birthday surprise party didn't start until 7 at the Yard, so it just gave us a reason for returning another day.  This didn't mean we couldn't enjoy small plates and drinks though in the mean time, so we did!  Maine Lobster Roll - succulent red lobster peaks out of dense buttery brioche bread. It looked like the lobster was waving, beckoning for a bite while wrapped in rich decadence...like a Tuft and Needle mattress enveloping you in a comforting embrace.  Sturgeon Bacon and Eggs with Crème fraiche and toast - house made sturgeon bacon was delicious. Salty goodness semi-familiar but unique at the same time because it takes you a minute to realize it's sturgeon not pork bacon.   Diver Scallop Crudo - served with heirloom tomato, smoked corn, avocado, shallot crackles. Come on, this is a shoe in. A bunch of favorite tastes mixed together with pillowy raw scallops. Definitely a fan of this one!!  Crispy Thai chili frog legs - crispy chicken wing-like appetizer with a splash of spiciness. Yes, real frog legs had the tender meat similar to that of chicken. The crispy texture combined with the spicy taste and tender meat was both interesting and enjoyable.  Grilled octopus - not chewy at all which is often a big fear for people. Very soft and easy to bite into and eat like well cooked calamari. Crazy salty though. Surprisingly, we did not enjoy this taste compared to the other small plates. Not sure if it was just salty or something unique in the seasoning or something just off with our own taste buds.. I'm stumped!!  7th Street Sazerac - Dickel rye, peychaud's bitters, absinthe, raw sugar. Loved this cocktail! Wanted to sip and savor it but it was soooo difficult to do so! Where's my discipline?!   Overall...Cleo's, You're awesome! Can't wait to return for happy hours and of course dinners too!"}
{"text":"Great place, can't beat the $1 oysters for happy hour but entrees little pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"Great raw bar. Cool atmosphere right next to the yard where you can continue the party. The wine selection is perfect. This is a must go!"}
{"text":"Went here on Thursday with a good friend at 5:30 PM.  Place was kind of dead with a few customers.  We sat in the patio which is nice this time of year.  We ordered the happy hour specials of oyster and shrimp for a dollar each.  Well the oysters tasted wrong and we returned the uneaten ones.  The shrimp tasted frozen, quickly thawed.  Not too god.    Had the drink 'subtle menace' on happy hour special.  It's okay.  Interesting taste.  The service seems disinterested, like they didn't want to be there.  We waived our server 5 or 6 times for the check, she looked straight at us and then turned her head each time.  Eventually she came by to serve a nearby table and that's when we finally got her attention.  Never had a server ever do that anywhere else in MY ENTIRE LIFE.  For the main course, we had King Crab Legs and Bouillabaisse.  The King Crab Legs were fresh and very good.  Probably one of the best in Phoenix.  The Bouillabaisse which consisted of shrimp, scallops, and mussels tasted like it was frozen and quickly thawed with a microwave.  Basically they taste like crap.  Not sure which is better, McDonald's or Long John Silver's."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, loved the oysters, kale salad was awesome and then loup de mer was amazing"}
{"text":"We went to the first of the Legendary Dinners and it was fabulous. Rachel and Sid were great and our server was as well. This was a 6 course meal accompanied by wine with every dish. The meal was delicious the service was excellent we will definitely go back on July 22nd to experience the next feast served by the executive chef. I really enjoyed talking to the other patrons as we enjoyed the creations by the chef. I highly recommend everyone to come to this restaurant because it is great. the staff and the environment and the food are fantastic. I must say it was my birthday and that made it that much more special."}
{"text":"The management and staff at Little Cleo's had reached out to me due to our previous experience and they more then made it up to us. Samantha was fantastic and was so pleasant and made sure that everything that we had was perfect. Service was absolutely amazing as well. You need to come here for the fish tacos and the butternut squash veggie dish. Amazing lobster roll as well. Cocktails were fantastic and it was overall a wonderful experience. I really appreciate the staffs willingness to make our dining experience as great as possible."}
{"text":"Overall very satisfied with the restaurant and atmosphere. Come earlier than your reservation as this place is located inside \"the yard\" which is a great covered outside area. It joins three fox concepts together with a large space to mingle before and after dinner.  We had a few cocktails from culinary dropout first which were all good. Then played bags in the yard, a very nice service from the tapas bar brought us over some goodies to sample while we were playing for free!   The dinner service was great I got the frog legs to start and ended up making the whole table try one. Even the squeamish loved this app, the oysters on the half shell were straightforward but good too.   We then split up a bunch of entrees and small plates for the whole table which I highly recommend. Then we ended with the buttermilk pie which was excellent..."}
{"text":"All the fish was fresh.  $1 oysters for Happy hour can't be beat. Great atmosphere. Sid, our waiter, was super friendly. Was there for my birthday on 8/17 and they sent me complimentary beignets with a candle. Everything was excellent. We enjoyed the yard games after. It was a little hot outside but it was fun being with my family. I recommend Little Cleo's. Parking is valet and worth giving a tip to the staff that had to sit in the heat to park our car. A+"}
{"text":"First tip: Sit at the counter, watch the chefs. The vibe is really cool and if your an industry person you will have a great time (even if your not you will get a kick out of it all) The gentleman who helped us was knowledgeable and very professional. He knew when to offer advice and when to just let us enjoy the show. I give him 5 stars for sure.  Food was excellent and fresh. We wanted to try as many items as we could and we were not disappointed with anything! We stared with oysters, couldn't tell you which ones, we went with our servers recommendation. Yum!! We then got the appetizer with king crab meat served in a mason jar of clarified butter... I wanted to drink the deliciousness when I was done stuffing my face with king crab meat. The grilled bread served with it was simple and tasty. Then we had the Scallop Crudo, another home run but not as memorable as our entree the Bouillabaisse. By far the best thing we had that night. So much flavor - even if it was a tad over salted. Ask for more bread with this one, your going to want to slop up all that saucy goodness...don't be shy... you know you want to."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Upscale and trendy spot in the the Yard. The sparse decor with minimalist stylings along with the white tile walls gives the place a sterile vibe. Patrons are typically 30 and above and a little less rowdy than those visiting the other establishments in the Yard.  Food/Service: The three varieties of oysters we tried were good however I can't comment on which ones we especially liked as the server-help couldn't remember which ones were which...very disappointing and I expected a little better service when dropping that much money on food.  The Maine lobster roll was delicious but portions were rather small. The warm jar of crab was also awesome.  Price: On the high end, reasonable for quality but unreasonable for portions.  Overall: Could be a four star establishment as the food was great but with the less than stellar service and small portions gotta go three stars. The place is still a great option for quality seafood. Probably still in my top three."}
{"text":"I love the ambience at The Yard and am impressed at the quality of Fox restaurants, however this one failed to impress!  The jar with king crab was yummy but our other appetizer the grilled octopus was ok at best.   Having lived near New Orleans for 15 years, I was disappointed on Fox's take on their Cajun shrimp. Their shrimp po boy was delicious and NOLA-esque. Their lobster dish was tasty but more suited for lunch.   Maybe all the good reviews are for their oysters which I didn't get. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Little Cleo had been on my radar for a while. So New Year's eve my son, visiting me from Seattle to be my care giver after my knee surgery, and I decided to have dinner there.  Let's start with the restaurant itself.  It is located in The Yard which houses other sister restaurants. Sister restaurants meaning owned by Fox Restaurants which operates Little Cleo.  The Yard is a great place with ample outdoor area with ping pong and other activities. We abstained as it had been only two days since my knee surgery.  Now to the food. It being New Year's eve, they had an abbreviated set menu.  We feasted on oysters, lobster bisque, steak and lobster thermidor and finished with pecan pie and one other dessert.  My take away: the food was absolutely great  The only thing that could have been better was attentiveness by the server. She was great but inconsistent. She was there when we really did not need her and Not There when we needed her.  But overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix and this was my first meal out in my new hometown. Great first choice! Love that this restaurant is nestled in a bustling multi use space. To start, the ambiance is impeccable. The decor is spot on and the open air kitchen creates an inviting and fun dining atmosphere. Service was top notch. Our server was attentive without being the least bit obtrusive. We ordered oysters to start and his wine suggestion was perfection! For dinner I opted for the Bouillabaisse. So glad I did, perfect balance of saffron and spices and the seafood was amazingly fresh. I finished my meal to the last drop and simply had no room left for dessert. Next time! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend/client last night for dinner.   Luckily, we went rather early so it was still happy hour, which ends at, what?? the early hour of 5:00.  Well, glad we weren't planning on ordering any food at that early hour, but we did order drinks from their HH menu.   I had the lemongrass yuzu mule, which, when I asked our server -- more about him/them later -- if it was similiar to a moscow mule.   He said, \"Yes.\"   I asked if I could have another vodka besides Smirnoff.   He said, \"Of course.\"   My companion had the house reisling or something.   I don't like sweet wine.   When I tasted it, it confirmed my opinion.   I liked my mule.   I asked that the second drink not have quite as much fresh lime, since, to my taste, it made it too tart.   The bartender did cut back on the lime, so the second drink came out el perfecto.   I had the Bouillabaisse  and he had the Traditional Fish & Chips.   I tasted his fish, which was fried.   It had a thin coating of batter, and the fish was plentiful and fresh and flavored just perfect.   I didn't try the fries.   I like sweet potato fries not the other.  Besides, there weren't that many and figured he might want to have them all.   My bouillabaisse was great.   It has shrimp, mussels, small bits of I believe clams? and was in a light tomato base sauce, which was quite tasty with a tiny \"kick\" to it, which I like.  Our servers were, I think, Shad and Casey.   So cute and efficient, personable, and professional.   Always made a point of giving us perfect service.   This is my second review on the restaurant.   I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We visited Little Cleo's last night.  Have enjoyed The Yard since it first opened and have looked forward to visiting Little Cleo's since it opened.  Its a little pricey but everything is made fresh literally right before you if you sit at the bar.  Best part of the meal was the service.  They work as a team and they are just very attentive, professional and personable.  We had a young lady (shorter blonde) who was just a take charge person and the people doing the cooking were awesome and everyone was very intent on ensuring our experience was great.  We did oysters which were sized right and fresh, the shrimp po boy which was fantastic, clam chowder which was tasty and the hush puppies which were also very good.  Everything was freshly prepared.  Excellent experience."}
{"text":"4.5 star  I had waited a couple of days for my Saturday seafood extravaganza and all of my hopes and dreams came to fruition.  My wife and I have been disappointed in our last few visits to a couple of other Fox Restaurant Concepts but this one was a homerun.  Upon arrival, I must say our experience was off to a bit of a bad start since valet was our only means of parking. Come on, we are not in downtown Phoenix here. I refused to pay to park on 7th St. and Bethany Home. My lovely wife embraced my plan to walk from a closed business that was a few extra steps away. Or maybe she just noticed how annoyed I was :).  Anyway, Little Cleo's food made up for my initial frustration.  We started our dinner off with the popular warm king crab in a jar and a few of their $1 shrimp (happy hour). The shrimp were fresh and tasty. As for the Crab in a jar, WOW!!!!!!!!!!! LOVED IT!!!!!!!! The crab swimming in warm butter and served with a side of perfectly cooked bread. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! Our very nice waitress even provided extra bread for dipping.  For dinner, we tried the Maine lobster roll and the bouillabaisse. The lobster roll was good. The bread as other Yelpers have mentioned was the best part of the dish. In my opinion, and this is coming from a lobster roll lover, the lobster needed to stay true to the dish and I felt like it was dressed up too much. It came with a tasty side of coleslaw. Now the bouillabaisse, YUMMYYYYY!!!! It was filled with perfectly cooked scallops, mussels, and shrimp. The broth was awesome and again, they provided some bread to soak it all up.    Lastly, since we checked in on Yelp upon arrival and purchased two entrees, we were given a free dessert. My wife saw sticky toffee pudding on the menu and I knew there would be no changing her mind. Once the dish came out and we took a few bites, I could tell my wife was in love.  She has now told me she wants the dessert as her last meal before going to heaven. I guess I will have to see what I can do. The dish came out in a jar similar to the warm lobster and my wife and I decided that anything in a jar here is money.  The pudding/cake was super warm and the toffee with ice cream was very good.   All in all we had a very nice meal and would definitely go back. I did forget to add that the restaurant is connected to other establishments that I believe are also FOX restaurants and it can be a little hard to notice at first. Once in though, the courtyard and grounds are very nice and it appears to be a very popular spot to hang out with friends and family.  A very nice dinner spot indeed. Now if only they would get rid of that dang valet they list as complimentary."}
{"text":"Little Cleo's is likely to be Phoenix's most unique gem for fresh and fun takes on seafood. The place is unique and refreshing, it hasn't disappointed since its opening over 3 short years ago. The setting is impressive when it comes to the details, you'll enjoy watching this staff work as they serve you.  Why go there: As you'll read in many of these reviews, the happy hour is probably the shrimp and oyster lovers' go-to in Phoenix. The small yet generous happy hour menu's main attraction would be the dollar colossal shrimp that comes with an amazing cocktail sauce dusted with a good portion of fresh horseradish, all served on a tray of ice. The oysters for the happy hour menu are also a must try, don't skip out on that mignonette, a fresh vinaigrette that will compliment the sweetness of those oysters.  Trying different oysters here is always fun. You go here for the ambience, the place is busy but not overwhelming, the seats at the bar to watch the crew in their open kitchen is a great spot to be. You can dine fast, or like us, line up a bunch of dishes to share and have the pros course it out for you.  The staff was super friendly, the manager, Danny, introduced himself, as well as James the Yard's boss man, they greeted my wife with a Mason jar of fresh flowers and glasses of champagne for our anniversary... Sam our waiter was deeply knowledgeable, telling us about the measures they take to only source from sustainable places. We like that.  Don't miss: The warm jar of king crab... they love to serve things in Mason jars here and they do it best when it's filled with chunky crab meat and clarified butter, served warm with grilled bread. Did you noticed I said FILLED? You can't come here and not get this dish.  I wouldn't undermine the specials, both main dishes and desserts. We had an amazing Lobster Gnocchi that was truly applaudable simply for its delicate sauce and pillow-like consistency. The lobster was plenty and just right garnished with a touch of micro greens to add a bit of fresh and bitterness to a pretty sweet dish. The dish also had fresh green peas, tasted like it came from the garden. What a fresh innovative dish that was surprisingly light on the palette! Dessert tonight was the cheesecake ice cream... we had it on the toffee cake... in another Mason jar. Spot on.  Overall: We had laughs and enjoyed the night because of a few factors: the food was different as far as specials, the crowd favorites hit a home run, and the seafood was fresh. The staff was hustling hard but attentive, this new gal was working her tail off setting up tables, clearing dishes... turns out it was her first day. Hats off to this Cleo's management team and the chef and his brigade. We hope you always bring your best for those who truly appreciate good food.   Hats off to the gents who shuck hundreds of oysters a night. Didn't have a single bit of grit in mine.   Bon ap!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for Valentine's Day and the fixed menu.  We arrived early and were seated ahead of the crowds - server was friendly and attentive, and seemed to know her stuff.  As with other Fox restaurants, they've got the atmosphere down -  though it's a bit cramped and the outside seating is mashed up against an outdoor play area so it was a bit noisy.  As far as the food went, everything tasted good and seemed fresh.  Still, there wasn't anything that stood out and in the end I wasn't impressed.  The shellfish supreme had a nice presentation and was tasty.  Oyster Rockefeller was tasty but piddly, you can get an equal or better offering at almost any other seafood restaurant.  NY Strip and bouillabaisse were also good but not great.  I enjoyed the beignets, though they are a far cry from Cafe du Monde's (don't make comparisons you can't live up to), but couldn't tell the chocolate cake from a Betty Crocker mix.  Also had a sazerac from the bar menu - was a decent approximation, but there was a bit too much bitters and it overpowered the other ingredients."}
{"text":"Always good. The oyster selection is top notch... Do yourself a favour and get a bubbly pairing. None of the entrees disappoint, seriously... Not even the basic Fish & Chips, delicious!  It's quickly & easily become our favorite seafood joint in Phoenix... Which means a lot coming from hubby's coastal Oregon upbringing."}
{"text":"I'll never understand why this place isn't packed to the gills every time I go (see what I did there? - seafood humor!)  This may be the best happy hour in Phoenix if you're into oysters, shrimps and champs. I've never left unsatisfied (and it's easy on the wallet).  We've also sampled a few other menu items including the hush puppies, cheesy garlic bread, and the piece de resistance: the crab jar. Literally a mason jar full of clarified butter and king crab. It's everything nice like sugar and spice, and requires 0 effort to enjoy (aka - no cracking crab legs and leaving with fishy smelling hands). It's also served with grilled bread - do yourself a favor and as for extra up front because you won't want to let the leftover butter in the jar go to waste when you're finished with the crab.  I'm also a fan of their one absinthe cocktail (it's the one with sauv blanc in it) - also half off or some other ridiculously cheap price during HH!"}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in,  I knew I was going to have a great experience.  Even though I was dining solo everyone I encountered had a bright friendly smile. Big points right there. I decided to sit at the bar for two reasons one I was dining solo and I didn't want to take up a table and two I wanted to be nosey and watch what was going on in the open kitchen.  I was handed off to a lovely gentleman by the name of Casey who was a complete sweetheart and made my dining experience even more enjoyable.  From his smile, to his pleasant demeanor to his recommendations he definitely gets five stars all to himself.  Now for the food. My word it was delicious.  I regret my decision not to.take any pictures but I didn't want to be rude. Almost a full pound of yummy Frog legs in a sweet and spicy sauce topped in cashews on top of a  savory slaw was my first course. Now if you are saying \"frog legs? EWW?\" Don't knock it until you try it. They really taste like chicken,  especially if they are done right and these were done perfectly!    Next course was the Bouillabaisse.  OMG.. mussels,  scallops,  shrimp oh my. It smelled heavenly and tasted divine! Sweet baby jesus! It was in a savory tomato, fennel saffron broth that also came with a piece of toasted bread. I had to stop myself from eating all if it because it was so good and I was already full from the frog legs.   Third and final delicious course was four freshly made beignets with warm caramel sauce. OMG!  I was only able to eat one piping hot, powdered sugar coated pillow of goodness that I dipped in caramel sauce. I was stuffed and forced myself to stop eating and take the rest home. I did however wash everything down with the complimentary glass of champagne that came with my meal as it was part of the restaurant week menu.  I swear I thought Casey was going to have to roll me out of the restaurant.    Will I be back? Absolutely!  I want to try more of there menu as well as some fresh oysters."}
{"text":"We were there this afternoon for an early dinner(my wife's 61st birthday). Valet parking, pleasant greeting, and a great view of the open kitchen.  I suggested she order the scallops because they're her favorite. I ordered the $1 oysters from the happy hour menu and the Kingcrab in a jar.  Both were extremely tasty but my wife's experience wasn't so great.   She ordered the Diver Scallop Crudo, and our server described it perfectly, but we forgot to ask about \"Crudo\".  It simply means that it's \"lightly seared\". So lightly seated that it's just about raw.  She couldn't eat more than two bites, so I finished her leftover portion.  It was pretty tasty but I understood her trepidation and disdain for uncooked food.  That said, she did enjoy her first Absinthe and she enjoyed it thoroughly.  We'll be back, but with a more informed view."}
{"text":"So sad that they are closing in two weeks. We had an amazing dinner! Fantastic service. Each thing we ordered was better then the previous item. From the hush puppies to the salmon. I am sorry we didn't eat there more often. Would be happy to sign a petition to Sam Fox to encourage him to open in the new spot ASAP."}
{"text":"Woof.  I hate giving a less-than-stellar review to a place I've anticipated and talked up so much, but I can't describe my experience at Little Cleo's with more than three stars.  I think I was expecting a Crudo-like experience ($35 tasting, ultra-hipster decor, similar items on the menu), and it just wasn't.  Our server was off that night.  We had super long waits between courses and my boyfriend's beer was altogether forgotten.  I requested twice for something special because we were celebrating my boyfriend's promotion.  Again, it was forgotten.  The food was extremely unmemorable.  Everything was seasoned with a LOT of salt and not much else.  My bouillabaisse came with a decent amount of seafood and an overly salted tomatoey concoction that was more sauce-like than a broth.  Guys!!!! Bouillabaisse is SOUP.  Can I get some mf-ing broth?? (I have an unhealthy obsession with broth.)  Ultimately, I think this would be a great place for happy hour, but other than that it's a meh."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, and right next the yard, plenty of after fun to be had. I decided to try this gem of a place after trying it at devoured festival. I was looking for the wow that i had experienced at their booth. We shared a handful of small bites. The oysters are the real star, but i would definitely recommend the Brussels sprouts and save room for the beignets for dessert! The scallop crudo was tasty, but i found the actual scallops got lost in the rest of the sauce/dish. I would skip the octopus, i found it charred a little too much and lacked flavor. However, there are a ton of items i left for my second visit, and am definitely excited to come back and try them!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to check this place out for awhile. We've been to Barrio and to Culinary Dropout and Restaurant Week kicked our butts into gear and finally made us pull the trigger on Little Cleo's.  I made a reservation not knowing how packed The Yard in general gets on a weekend night -- so I would definitely recommend that. We are usually only ever here for brunch.The restaurant week menu was great and only $33/person. I think they will be keeping the menu through the rest of the summer. We were seated at the bar by the oysters and the dude shucking them. At first I was totally annoyed but turns out to be the best seat in the house IMO. You get to see the kitchen in action and interact with the staff which was fun. You can also buy the kitchen staff a beer at $2. The Hub was all about this and really we just wanted to see what happened. We assumed it would be $2/head but it wasn't. We were all nerdily excited thinking they would crack a brew right then and there but they must bank them for the end of the evening or its just another way for the restaurant to squeeze money out of you.   As an amuse bouche, we had our choice between two oysters and two shrimp. I went oyster (briny, creamy, delicious) and Hub went with shrimps and he loved them and said he wanted 20 more.  Next up: I went frog legs and Hub went with the sturgeon bacon, egg, creme fraiche on toast. The frog legs were so good! Super meaty and tender, with fish sauce, cashews and some sort of sweet chili goodness sitting on a bed of cabbage. Absolutely delicious. Hub's bacon and egg was delicious. The sturgeon bacon was phenom! Pair that with an egg, creme fraiche, on some toasty toast. Wow. I could have eaten 4 more pieces. A must try!  For our main course, I had the squid ink pasta with mussels and Hub had the fish and chips. As far as fish and chips go, it was good. Nothing special but good nonetheless. My pasta was good too. Not the highlight of the meal but good. It was loaded with mussels which I was happy about and the squid ink pasta was al dente and cooked perfectly. Could have even been fresh pasta.   Both desserts were fantabulous. The banofee tart was yummy, creamy banana-y custard with some toffee and top with chocolate ice cream. Then the apple cobbler (served in a tiny mason jar) was delightful. I loved the hint of sharpness that the cheddar in it provided."}
{"text":"Great experience here! The oysters were so fresh and every employee was so kind and accommodating. I loved sitting at the oyster bar and watching the guys clean each oyster and pack it on ice. Dessert was delicious too, happy to recommend this place to anyone looking for fresh seafood in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Salty oysters and a \"hostess\" that refused to seat us in our previously reserved area...LC is overhyped due to a lack of other seafood establishments in the city."}
{"text":"There is only two things you really need to know. The Seafood is fresh and the Service is great. The best thing on the menu is the jar of crab in butter served with toast but the portion is about half what it was back when they opened and the price is the same. The hush puppies are authentic and very good. The thing you have to watch here are the cocktails. They are outstanding but very small and add up in a hurry. Our drink bill is always double our food bill here but overall it's a good time and there aren't many fresh Seafood options in Phoenix. Fried Green Tomato's would be a welcomed addition to the small plates menu."}
{"text":"This review is way overdue! We visited Little Cleo's a couple months ago, and we had a wonderful experience. I'll highlight what was great:  Chamomile gin and tonic - gin and tonic is my go-to, but this sounded like a cool twist. It was so good! Very balanced and smooth. The chamomile was not overpowering at all.  Frog legs - AMAZING! This is the best item on the menu. We ordered a second round because they are that good. Crispy outside, tender almost delicate meat and tangy, crunchy sauce.  King crab in butter - comfort food. It was warm and juicy, and the grilled bread was a nice addition.  The atmosphere of this place was very nice. Great service too. I only wish they were open for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Last night my friends and I had the pleasure of dining at Little Cleo's. It was a wonderful dining experience and a treat to my taste buds but I will say there were a few knocks on the place.   Our first impression was trying to get in the parking lot. My goodness, it's a disaster. It's like a used car parking lot. Cars, cars, cars everywhere. They do have complimentary valet, so I can't complain too much. I guess if you're not in the mood to valet, don't bother because you really have no choice. Make sure you clean your car before you head to dinner.   We walked into the entrance after parking and I have to say the ambiance and the atmosphere are incredible. Wouldn't recommend outdoor eating in the summer (although, they did have misters going) but in the spring, it's really kind of fun to people watch and sit outdoors. The courtyard area is beautiful.   The food is fabulous. I did order the Ahi Tuna large plate which they were out of. I also ordered the Spinach, they were out of that as well! Saturday night dining and they were out of 2 items on their menu. A bit disappointing but it forced me to order the Scallop Crudo. Wow! The Scallop Crudo was delicious and my favorite thing on the menu.   We ended with dessert. Their Toffee sticky pudding was out of this world. Normally, I'm a huge fan of only chocolate but this dessert had to be top 3 desserts in the valley! Even my husband,who does not have a sweet tooth like mine, said it was incredible and we were fighting for the last bite.   Overall, fabulous service, atmosphere and food! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing Valentine's Day special menu. Fish entree was slightly over cooked, but that happens! They offered to substitute it and fix the issue right away so good customer service. The area the restaurant is in is called \"the yard\" a covered indoor/ outdoor area combining several restaurants in one large area. Cool concept. A place to \"see and be seen\" can be a little loud with hundreds of people dining at all the places there but it's a wonderful place. Delicious food."}
{"text":"Got here for happy hour enjoyed shrimp and oysters and then the seafood platter...also must try the king crab jar...all really good.  Another example that AZ has fresh seafood :)  Friendly and informative staff, great style of its own right next to the Yard.  Nice absinthe cocktails too.  Definitely will be back in the spring to play ping pong outside, will have to steal a table from the kids"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  In the summer it's 4-6pm.   $1 oysters and shrimps cocktail style. They were both super fresh and tasty. The mignonette was great on both the oysters and shrimp.   My Babay had Kir Royales, which were nice and cold, and I had one of the special absinthe cocktails, the Sour Menace I believe - I keep forgetting the name! Lol... too many.  We also tried the diver scallop crudo and the sweet corn hushpuppies. The crudo flavors combined excellently and the hushpuppies were soft and delicious.  You HAVE TO try the king crab in a jar...lol. We watched a cook prep them and we had to try it. Very simply,  it's the meat from jumbo king crab legs served warm in a small jar with clarified butter, a touch of herbs and white truffle. So simple and sooo delicious. Just add a touch of sea salt to maximize flavor, since clarified butter has very little salt.   Excellent people who work there. Casey, our bartender was superb. His drink and menu knowledge was on point. Kyle, the manager, was a super guy. Everyone was so friendly and professional.   I definitely recommend Lil Cleo's for happy hour or dinner. The open kitchen was setup very ingeniously.   We are probably going to their next Legendary Dinner, which is a multi course meal ($55) with a wine pairing also available ($20)."}
{"text":"Here tonight for my wedding anniversary. This is one of the best seafood restaurants I've ever eaten at. The server, Leontine, told us that the seafood is received fresh daily. We had the hush puppies which were baked to perfection. You sit right next to the kitchen because it is a small intimate place. But it's pretty cool because you get to watch the chefs in action. I watched one plate the food with such attention to detail it was like he was painting a picture. I bought the kitchen a beer for $2.00 (you're allowed to,it's on the big menu board. My 7 yr old loves seafood so maybe on a special occasion I'll take him here.  Quick update to my review. I just saw the hostess, who was leaving for the night (she had her purse in her hand) still greet a couple that came in and seat them even though her shift ended. For the manager's record, this was Joelle. What customer service!"}
{"text":"I got the fish and chips. Fish was pretty good, the fries were way over cooked. Our table took advantage of the dollar oysters and shrimp. I ended up getting food poisoning, therefore I'm giving it a lower rating"}
{"text":"I don't know what the legend is, but this place is definitely legendary. I've been here twice for oysters. They were phenomenal both times. We got all the ones one their menu both times and they are all truly different so go hungry! I've had the bacon and eggs which ate also delicious, but you have got to try the crab pot simmered in butter! So good! The kitchen and wait staff are great and very helpful. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  This place makes for a pleasant date night.  This place is packed full of ice displays with the freshest of seafood!  Positives: This place is a gem of it's own kind.  Classy yet relaxed.. Fresh simple seafood with a twist of the newest decor and taste.    YOU MUST TRY THE LOBSTER IN A JAR!!!! Heavenly. Warm fresh lobster chunks in a warm butter sauce, served with bread. You can't go there and not get this. Make sure to ask for more bread.. Don't let that butter sauce go down the drain LOL   The bouillabaisse was so incredibly amazing! I recommend this!!! The lobster roll was not my favorite, but it was still good. I prefer the more simple flavors on a lobster roll.  The fresh shrimp was lovely.    Lastly the pudding dessert was to die for. For real. Do it.   Negatives: Wasn't crazy over the lobster roll but the entire experience was wonderful and full of flavor!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great atmosphere. We started with the oysters and they wee as fresh as the ones we have had in San Francisco.  We also had the blue crab butter cup, WOW it was great with the toast. The  parking was not the greatest you are better off parking at the Bashas and taking a very short stroll its across the street!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The crab in a jar was ridiculous and the Virginia oysters on the half shell were the best I've had in Arizona!  Location is fun and valet parking was fast and efficient. It's not cheap, but well worth the money!"}
{"text":"Wow just wow. This is easily the best dinner and food service I have ever experienced - as a chef myself - I love trying different restaurants seafood (pref. scallops) and let me tell you the Scallop Crudo is DIVINE. I had never tried anything like this before but the sauce was delicious and the scallops were so fresh and tender. A perfect sized appetizer to share for 2. For entree I got the Lobster Roll and all the other reviews were right! The buttered bread was to die for. Not the mention the combination of the chilled, tender crab with the old bay sauce and celery greens..AMAZING. Since it was my birthday I received a free dessert and I ordered the citrus tart with raspberry compote. It was refreshing yet still perfectly sweet. I rarely ever have room for dessert but all the dishes were perfectly portioned! The service was by far the speediest and friendliest I have ever experienced and Erin was an amazing waitress. She made sure my partner and I were 100% aware of what was in the food we were wanting to order (as we try to avoid dairy/cheese/egg and do not eat meats) When Erin could not get to us, other waiters stepped in to clear our table/get our dessert order/get our check/refill our water. It's amazing these waiters go out of their way to accommodate tables that they are not assigned to, as it is rare that others want to take on something that is not theirs. I have no complaints, this was the best birthday dinner I've had to date. I recommend this restaurant 100% to any seafood lover. Thank you little cleo's!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated father's day at this place. Everything was great. From appetizers to dessert. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time here, Beautiful service! The best service we have had in a while! Upbeat enjoyable atmosphere! Extremely attentive personnel! The food was DELICIOUS!! From start to finish, the staff was on top of everything! Would definitely come again! And I would definitely recommend to a friend!  ;)"}
{"text":"Ate here recently. Great service, delicious food. Not jazzed about the dessert, but still a great experience.   Please get the crab in a jar. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I can only speak for one of the \"small plates\" offered at Little Cleo's- the Warm Jar of King and Butter with grilled bread!  I'm a big fan of King Crab but not a fan of the work it takes to get those succulent bits of meat out.  So for me, this dish was heaven on a plate.  It was a little pricey for what you get - about a 1/2 cup of crab swimming in hot clarified butter with about 6 small slices of grilled ciabatta bread (which was pretty tasty as it came from a local bakery, although I would've preferred a nice crusty sourdough).  I'll have to come back another time when my appetite is bigger and try the shrimp po'boy!"}
{"text":"The legend is true! Our meal was easily one of my favorites to date, and such a pleasant surprise from this little offshoot of Culinary Dropout. Everything we had was spectacular (save for the tuna tartare which was good not great).   Our order consisted of: - Oysters - Tuna tartare - Crispy frogs legs- A MUST! - Crab and warm butter w/ grilled bread (What dreams are made of) - Lobster roll - Bouillabaisse- lovely  I was a little hesitant about the frogs legs at first, (it was hard to wrap my head around eating a frog.) But I had give to them a try. And guess what? They were FANTASTIC. We couldn't stop gushing over that sweet, spicy, sticky sauce and how perfectly they complimented the crispy frogs legs. Now I'm ALLLLL about dem frogs. Then the crab came...and I almost died, it was so good. Everything about this dish was perfectly executed and delicious.  Delicate, sweet juicy crabmeat swimming in a jar of warm, butter.  We polished the entire plate (and jar, which I would have also eaten).  I could eat this every day of my life.  It's a casual spot but the dishes blew all the fancy, upscale seafood restaurant meals we've had in the past, out of the water.  The service was attentive and the chef was gracious and so hospitable. We will absolutely be back... cannot wait!"}
{"text":"This place is very good, but pricey. We went in for the $33 three course promotion. We orroded the kale salad, octopus, fish and chips and the mussel linguine.  The kale salad was the highlight, one of the best salads if ever had with roasted almonds and tiny. Crispy bacon bits inside. The linguine misses sells with squid ink and mint was also excellent. Portions were a little on the small side. Even with an extra dozen oysters, we still left I little underfed.  $2 cheap 'champagne' during happy hour!. Bill for 2 came to $120."}
{"text":"This was the one place in Phoenix which served up great seafood...and now it's gone. Hopefully not forever, as I think they are looking for a new location. We truly enjoyed dining at Little Cleo's! Great service... and GREAT dishes.  Thank you to the staff for a number of enjoyable evenings at your establishment."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I have to frame the context of our visit: our first experience to Little Cleo's was on the day of our second anniversary. We wanted to the event to not only be special in ambiance, but also paired with exquisite food. We were a little hesitant because of it's location within the 'Yard' complex, and were worird we about the noise, but this restaurant culminated a little niche of it's own. Little did we know, we got much more than we had ever expected!   We made reservations, even though it was a Monday, just to be sure. And we are glad that we did! For a Monday, the restaurant was quite busy! We decided to sit at the oyster bar, which was awesome because we had the pleasure of watching the chefs prepare the meals! These guys are meticulous technicians, and it showed during their preparation and presentation of the dishes.   Moving on to our server. I wish I could name drop him right now, because he was simply put: excellent. He walked us through the myriad of menu options, from the prefixed menu to the seasonal dishes, and provided some great insight as to the menus key dishes. We were so thankful that we considered his suggestions!! Not only that, but he also gave some worthwhile advice on the appropriate parings with the dishes: from cocktails paired with appetizers, wine with the entrees and cordials with dessert. This man was dialed in, attesting to his self-descriptive title of being a 'foodie', that my wife and I easily identify with!   The food, was bar none, the best seafood we have ever had on this side of the country (and arguably some of the best we have ever had in general). Mind you- we have been spoiled with the freshest oysters from the New England coast and same-day catches from the South Atlantic off the coast of Florida, so there was a pretty high bar to surpass.   From the assortment of raw oysters, seared scallops, grilled octopus, flayed sea bass and apexing with soft beignets dipped in bourbon-caramel reduction. Simply amazing. Presentation was gorgeous, portion size was generous and taste is nearly indescribable. Granted, the price point is up there, but the quality really justifies this. Not just any restaurant can provide excellent quality seafood in the middle of the Sonoran desert.   Nearing the end of our visit, we were given a sample of their house made limoncello. A perfectly sweet nightcap to solidify an amazing experience. It is a sure bet that we will be back. My only regret is not getting the name of our server, this man needs to be applauded for making our experience what it was."}
{"text":"I was not sure how to feel about this place when I first got seated. Had reservations and arrived on time, got seated, and the place looks eccentric, and fun. Got some rose and bear, they all were great.   For a city that does not have fresh sea food, we thought about ordering oysters and test it out, we got the California oysters and they were actually good, not as fresh as oysters we've had in Nelson bay in Australia :-). Then we ordered some starters (octopus, frog legs, clam chowder, scallops) they all tasted great. My family members who came from Australia actually were impressed that in a dessert city we got somewhat of a fresh seafood. I was not a fan of the frog legs.   For our main entrees we got the salmon, fish and chips and Bouillabaisse. We all loved our food, and enjoyed it.   Now the negatives. So for a seafood restaurant, please have cloth napkins...  Noise level, though it is an upbeat and active place, it was hard to talk to one another or even talk to the server. Not sure if that can be changed but thought I'd mention it. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Really yuppie kind of dive.... if you are really into Oyster's- this place is for you!  Waitstaff really nice and answered all our questions.  The kitchen is open concept so you can watch as the make your food.  Nice and relaxing atmosphere.   If you are looking at the photos; don't come for the beignets- they don't have them anymore :("}
{"text":"Good food (recommend the shrimp po boy and the fish & chips) and GREAT customer service. I didn't like what I originally ordered (the loup de mer-yuck!) but my waiter and the manager brought me something else and seemed to genuinely want to fix the problem and I appreciate that!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm a fan all right.  But...  I read about this dish they have there that called, \"warm jar of king crab and butter with grilled bread\".  Who could resist that?  I didn't.  It was sooooooooooooo delicious!  I'm eating the crab, the butter is dripping; hell, it's in little tub of butter so it's GOT to drip!   But you know, the last time I ate that much butter was...never and, by the time I got home, I was ill.  Not they're fault.  Mine.  So rich.  So good.  Don't think I can do it again."}
{"text":"Arrived late- 9pm on a Friday. Awesome staff. Out of some things- but great west coast oysters, scallop crudo, frogs legs... beer. Casual and a great road trip find."}
{"text":"The best Easter brunch is at Little Cleo! Normally they are closed on Sunday. The first year they did Easter Sunday brunch buffet, we were there and enjoy all fresh seafood and brunch items. This year we went there again. Although it is an a la cart but all the dishes are perfectly made. I had crab Benedict and roasted butternut squash & maple syrup. They served the freshest seafood on top of perfect poached egg. We fall in love with Little Cleo all over again."}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G.  Second time we have been here and totally satisfied. Once we had a large group and this time as a couple. The service is outstanding!  If you have the opportunity to sit in Sam's section, please do!  He is wonderfully attentive and so considerate. The food is wonderful and consistent. Order the crab and butter jar early before they run out!  Great place for special occasions."}
{"text":"After leaving my first review, the manager, Mike Donaldson, contacted me and was concerned that my experience was not the norm.  In my mind, that kind of follow through shows incredible customer service, so we made a return visit to Little Cleos.  We sat inside this time and it was so much better.  It has a cool 1920's nautical vibe going on.  The manager was so nice and our server was amazing.  The service was some of the best I have experienced.  She didn't hesitate to recommend some of her favorite dishes and she was spot on.  The crab in a jar is fabulous.  I had a cocktail called the Subtle Menace which was CRAZY good.   The cajun shrimp was spicy - just how I like it and my hubby had the NY Strip which came covered in a crab sauce.  Delish.  Pumpkin fritters were like home made donuts like my mom in law makes, but with more pizazz.  Overall, I am glad we gave this place a second chance.  It was immensely better this time and judging from how happy the servers all seemed, and how in tune the manager was with his staff and customers, I'm pretty sure our first experience was just a fluke.  I was more than impressed with Little Cleos and will return.   Of all the things I've tried, I still recommend the bouillabaisse and kale salad because they were out of this world."}
{"text":"Have been there a few times for oysters. Though $1 oysters are very reasonable, each time I have tried them they appear to be smaller. They are quite tasty, however, if I go again I may not be able to find them to eat them. I enjoy raw oysters and try them many places in Phoenix and elsewhere.  Have never seen such small oysters ever!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed because they were out of everything! They had three appetizers that were sold out and even ran out of the house Cab I was drinking. I waited at least twenty minutes to order a beer while I waited for my wife too. Besides that the king crab in a jar was phenomenal and the bouillabase was fantastic. We also tried the frog legs and scallop crudo....both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Chill vibe with excellent food... just the kind of place we like! Came here for Happy Hour on a Saturday. We were seated right away, preferred to be seated at the bar rather than our reserved seats. Everything from our food, drinks to service was great. With 4 drinks, oysters, shrimp, bouillabaisse and lobster roll our bill came out to $122. Not bad considering how much seafood/quality we had.    We will definitely be back to try to rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great seafood place located in the yard. Have oysters on display when you walk in.  We ordered a dozen oysters and we were able to request to have them grilled or fried. This is not on the menu but they accommodate requests quite happily.  We also got frog legs which for me were a little gamy.  I wish the menu had more choice but over all was a good experience. It was my dads and mine birthday. They brought out free desert which tasted amazing."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but I have to as this place is exceptional!  We came here to celebrate our 6th anniversary and we had a wonderful experience.  The seafood is flown in fresh daily and we were not disappointed.  The food is amazing and the service is top notch.  We were expecting paying our bill and the manager brought us an incredible desert to celebrate our anniversary.  I highly recommend this restaurant as you won't be disappointed.  Make reservations as it will ensure a table."}
{"text":"If I could have taken the bouillabaisse home in a thermos and eaten it everyday for lunch and dinner the rest of my life, I would have. I loved it. I also loved the fresh oysters from the Pacific Northwest. They aren't open on Sundays because they can't get fresh seafood on Sundays! Although that's a drag for me, it's the best reason to be closed. It's only too bad they are so close to The Yard."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the menu here. At first glance I got a little nervous - I'm a pretty open minded person when it comes to food but frog legs and squid ink pasta sounded intimidating. Try something new or ask for a recommendation - everything I tried here ended up being delicious. The homemade hush puppies were an instant favorite.   Everything else here in addition to the food was  amazing. Good customer service (they are very careful about food allergies, thank you!) and unique environment. Probably more of a place for late eaters. It really isn't that hard to find, it's combined with The Yard and Culinary Dropout, which has a big sign as you approach it and they have free valet parking. It's fun to be able to look out at The Yard while you eat.   I wouldn't take a star away for the price, but be ready for a high bill. Two entrees with two glasses of house wine and an appetizer and a tip can hit the triple digits here. After dinner we debated if the cost was because we were paying for high quality food or if that was just an obnoxious popular restaurant thing. We decided that when it comes to seafood we'd rather splurge on super fresh, tasty fish than risk the cheap places."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place. I really liked the elegance of the service. It was wonderful. The parts were very generous. This is a great place to take part in delicious food. Be sure to stop at this place if you like seafood."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of seafood but this place takes the cake. Between the warm inviting environment and the very knowledgeable staff my experience here couldn't have been more perfect. We had Casey as our server and he was superb. I would come back just for his service. My boyfriend and I had the oysters to start and they were absolute perfection. For our app what better the squid! Then both the squid ink pasta and the bouillabaisse were amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone who has a love for fresh and inventive sea food with a down home comfortable feel!!!!  If I could give more then 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Little Cleo's = Incredible!   Review end.   . . .  HAH! Being a vague or \"Tip Style\" reviewer is criminal, so here we go.   Located on the Yard, this place is small and adorable. I loved being able to watch what was going on in the open kitchen.  If you can't handle a little bit of noise I wouldn't recommend sitting on the patio as it gets loud.   Dude took me here on a Friday night, and we didn't go seeking oysters (shame, next trip!), but we did share:   1) Bouillabaisse  2) Cajun Shrimp  3) Garlic Fries with Aioli   Anything seafood is high quality and you won't be disappointed.   The scallops in the Bouillabaisse were very tender and I had to resist keeping the whole plate for myself.   The broth was also perfectly savory, with not quite subtle yet not overpowering notes of fennel and saffron.  Pro Tip, save that grilled bread for the broth, you'll want to soak every last drop up!   Once again, the Cajun Shrimp delivered and it did not hold back on the spices! The traditional red potatoes and corn were not missing.   As for those Garlic Fries, I'm going to save my calories in the future as they weren't memorable. Pretty sure we didn't even finish them.   Don't forget to enjoy one of their many Royales (two thumbs up for Grapefruit and Elderflower) and check out the extensive Absinthe list - Yes, Absinthe!   Our server was a doll and did an excellent job without being overbearing or forgetting us - Especially since we were the only folks on the patio that evening.   Got a sneak peek of those Beignets drenched in Whiskey Caramel, and holy SMOKES was way too stuffed to indulge.    . . . But now there's an excuse to come back. ;)   Go already!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's meh-ish.  My husband and I went tonight for my birthday.  This is the second time we've had dinner there (there first time was New Year's Eve), and both times the place has been about 1/5th full.  Firstly, DO NOT order the \"diver scallop crudo, pine nuts, capers, sultana, crispy cauliflower & watercress.\"  There were no discernible capers, sultana or cauliflower in the dish.  When we pointed this out to the server, she said something like, \"Oh, well, those are all ground up and part of the crumble.\"  Really? Well, if chunky items like all of those are not identifiable in the dish, then don't list them.  What was worse, is that it was all soaked in some type of creamy mayonnaise stuff that was awful.  My husband asked the server who, by the way, had the most affected/ingraciating way of speaking (almost to the point of being condescending), the definition of \"crudo\".  She replied, \"It means 'salad'\".  That sounded completely wrong to me.  So I googled it and it means \"raw\", which is what the scallops were and that's OK.  What is not OK, is for a server to BS her way through a customer question -- just say, \"I'll go ask right now and come back with the answer.\"  I was shocked to find out they had no Grey Goose.   I ordered a Grey Goose on the rocks, and the server said that they don't serve it.  I don't think I have EVER experienced a higher-ticket dining establishment that didn't have GG.  Now on to what's good -- the clam chowder, the grilled loup de mer, glazed salsify, wax bean, shallot & lemon, and the bouillabaisse with scallops, mussels, shrimp, tomato, fennel, and saffron.  Not sure about returning."}
{"text":"What more could one want than some freshly chucked oysters!? Their happy hour is a killer value, staff is knowledgable and makes great recommendations. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Little Cleo's - another spot that has been hovering on my foodie bucket list.  Since my heart actually does belong to Bean Town, I am a bit of a seafood snob. We were dining with another couple, one of which was another native Bostonian and bonafide seafood expert. Our collective love of most anything from the Ocean lead us to Little Cleo's.  We were celebrating and wanted to ensure we could get seated so we opted for a last minute reservation. I was skeptical that we would be able to secure a spot so last minute, no problem there! The table we were led to was tucked away in the back of the restaurant making it cozy and as secluded as possible for this busy little gem of a place.  Staff: So incredibly nice, friendly, smiling, looked genuinely happy to be interacting with us. In addition to food, I am also passionate about fashion.  The young woman who greeted and seated us was wearing a bright summer fruit printed dress that made me smile, a nice change from uniform restaurant garb.  Our server was awesome!  She new the menu intimately and helped us all weigh our choices in a practical informed fashion.  Ambiance: Love the open concept and blending of venues, i had plenty to look at but not in an overstimulating way. Maybe a decibel too loud yet since we were in a corner it helped keep sounds muted enough where we could have an audible conversation.  Food:  Definitely above average for this seafood lover, again I have been spoiled by some of the best seafood in the Nation, AZ not really on the leader board in this category.  The \"toast\" was a hit especially when dipped in the butter from the crab legs jar - decadent, artery clogging, gut busting but worth it!  Friend in a posted picture had the oysters and octopus as well as the shrimp poor boy, he raved about all three. Fish and Chips - worth the bath in hot oil necessary for this staple!  I had the crab legs in a jar - warm and succulent crab, yummy, yum, yum! The last dish to review was a disappointment - cajun shrimp with corn and potatoes.  Shrimp were rock hard like the first time I boiled shrimp without instruction. The cajun spice was good but not great.  Bummer: They were out of lemon icebox cake I was saving room for.    Prices: Well it is seafood after all...fish don't swim in the dessert."}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife and I had our anniversary dinner here last night. We both loved the food, atmosphere and service. This classy yet casual place has the best food I have eaten in a long time. Thoughtful, fresh food that is prepared with skill and love....delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I thought their food is a little pricey... For a 4-course meal, their starters was a 2piece oyster atop a bed of crushed iced. It smelled a little fishy. I liked their black pasta which is basically squid ink with some mussels cooked with it. I loved the service though!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found Little Cleo's.  OMG the happy hour is unbelievable!  Husband I stopped in before the Miranda Lambert concert, sat at the bar and ate the $1 oysters and $1 shrimp.  Oysters were medium to small, which I prefer, and fresh and tasty.  Sitting at the bar you can watch the \"show\" of shucking the oysters.  And they churn them out.  The $1 shrimp were plump and firm and HUGE.  The $2 champagne isn't swill like I was afraid it would be.  Tasty and good-sized pour.  We got out of there full and for under $50 with tip.  Definitely putting this place in our dining out rotation.  Almost forgot:  the dinners being cooked smelled oh so delicious.  We wished we'd had more of an appetite (or stretchy pants) to keep eating.  Service was attentive, friendly and welcoming. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"YUM! I've been to Little Cleo's 2.5 times, yes 2.5. The first time was a date night and it was very cute and chic. The Pinot noir they have on tap(yes I said tap) was really good, oysters are awesome and the French fries are very very good!  So that was one time.. then we had a birthday gathering at the yard and my friends went to order dozens of oysters while we were at the other restaurant which was pretty cool. Then finally.. I made it to the $1 oyster happy hour and it was out of this world amazing. I would highly recommend checking it out for happy hour or a nice date night. I didn't feel rushed during happy hour although every seat was filled and there were oysters everywhere.. it still had the calm fun vibe it had the first time I visited. Highly recommend, definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is cracking! My date tried the warm Alaskan Crab legs in a jar. It was so good drenched in butter. I tried the Tuna tartare and it was delicious and perfect for me. I wanted Moscato Wine but they don't serve it. So my super duper handsome waiter surprised me with dessert. Speedy service and great customer service on a packed Friday NIGHT. VALET PARK AND IF IT'S CROWDED Just  SIT AT THE BAR."}
{"text":"This is my GF's and my favorite restaurant. It's delicious every time, and easily the best place to get fresh fish in Arizona."}
{"text":"This was the only Fox Restaurant we haven't tried, and like the others, Little Cleo's didn't disappoint. We were seated promptly, our server was very informative about the oysters and provided her favorites, some dishes came out really quickly. We decided to graze for our dinner and ordered the small dishes to share, and they were all absolutely delicious. For our next visit we will try the large entrees. Only opportunity for the experience would be that our server had forgotten a glass of wine we ordered and we had to ask for napkins a couple times."}
{"text":"My favorite seafood restaurant in Arizona hands down.The concept really knocked it out of the park!amazing food, beautiful decor and an top notch staff.  Kristen went out of her way to assist me in getting my favorite dessert that is no longer on the menu after a brief phone call! I've been impressed by many of the waiters and kitchen staff here. I really love coming to cleos and the amazing staff makes it so easy to return. Thank you !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely. Incredible. Crab appetizer. GM was there to service us. Great location. Just stop reading and go eat. Take my word for it."}
{"text":"Everyone so friendly from managment to waitress to Kitchen staff i like to sit around food Bar  watch the chefs prep the good. My waitress Maleigha...nicest person ever. Logan,Edwin ,Casey, manager chef and oyster shucker also deserve mention.  Great seafood presented with quality that is hard to find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in the side of the Yard. I've been to the Yard many times, I occassionally get food if I'm looking for bar type snacks.   I've seen little cleos once or twice and passed by thinking I should try it. I love the idea of finding a favorite seafood restaurant in the city.   When trying this place for the first time I ordered as much as I thought I could eat as I do with most new places. I found that the appetizer / small plate options were the most reasonably priced even though a little expensive.   I loved half of what I got. The corn fritters were good, the garlic bread was good, the crab in a jar was also good.   The things I did'nt like were the oysters, they didnt taste fresh and I'm almost certain they weren't cleaned properly as I had sand in my mouth.   I also did not care of the frog legs, they were chewy, overcooked and wet / soggy in a unpleasant way.   It sucks that I liked most of what I had but you can't have a good seafood restaurant without good seafood.."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Love the oysters and old scuba mask on display as you walk in.   My wife and I had a gift card that brought us to the restraint. We have been to The Yard several times but had never stopped by Little Cleo's. We are glad we did.   I had a steak and my wife had their clam pasta. We were both very pleased with our meals. When we are in the mood for seafood we will go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite date spot! They are so nice and friendly! The food is absolutely delicious! I had the jar of crab and the boullabaise and they were unbelievable! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"More 3.5 rating.  This place is solid and the food is good.  We ordered a lot of small plates and one large plate.  Our dinner consisted of:  Oysters (not bad) Crispy frog legs (tasty, the cashew and Asian flare is a nice touch) Sweet corn hush puppies ( buttery and rich, very soft, I was secretly hoping there was kernels of corn in those balls) garlic french fries with aioli (nothing special) parmesan brussel sprouts, miso, yuzu, and truffle oil (delicious and the flavors were subtle) Bouillabaisse (my favorite dish, was so flavorful with the mix of seafood and saffron...mmmmm....and it came with grilled bread to soak up all that yumminess)For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding with nutella ice cream (liked the ice cream part of it, was good the first two bites and then was a little too sweet after that)  Service was fantastic and atmosphere was nice, you can hear the sounds and crowds and band playing from culinary dropout."}
{"text":"So here's my experience and the reason I will give it 4 instead of 5. My reviews tend to be long so if you don't want to read. Yes I will be back.   Let's start with the menu. You can get great value for your money this summer with their summer small plate prix fixe menu for 33-35 dollars. And it's a great choice for what you get. You get a choice of a cold shellfish shrimp or oysters. Side note don't get scare when they come out and it's two small shrimp or oysters on a large plate of ice. It gets better as the menu progresses. Then you get a choice of salads or small hot plates. Like a kale salad or the bacon and eggs. Tip get the bacon and eggs you won't be disappointed. Next will be your entrees. I don't remember the list but get the bouillabaisse again won't be disappointed the majority of the table got it except for a few fish and chips. They were also impressed with their dishes. Next is the desert. I can't really comment on that because I am not a big sweets or chocolate person, but can tell you that one has Nutella. And the women that were with us thought it was orgasmic. I tried it was ok but too sweet for my liking. And by this point I am more interested in the whiskey instead.   I ordered their 55 dollar appetizer and was disappointed in the oyster size and shrimp size. I know it's not oyster season and we are in Arizona but they were on the tiny size but it was made up for with the lobster size. I had ordered it thinking it would satisfy a meal, but it didn't. And I read a review of the lemon sizes and they were not lying. I am not sure where you can procure lemons that small but I have had grapes bigger than that. I guess it was to not give the oyster a size complex. A half real lemon with a cover would have worked fine. A detail deduction was that I was not give a small fork for the oysters and lobster. Don't worry I survived with a normal fork. The good this was that this came out during the second course so I had enough time to view the menu for a normal dish. So I ordered the po boy. Again great value for the what you get.  Bun stuffed with shrimp shredded lettuce. And a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw was good but lacked a bit of salt probably my preference only others thought it was good.   Now on to the service. The service was decent but nothing to brag about. One thing that eerks me to no end is being rushed. Meaning being asked if I want the bill and dessert is being served. The proper thing to do is ask once everyone is done eating. And we were enjoying our company. This is really the only gripe I have. Other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"Little Cleo's was selected for this month's Foodie Adventure for our party of 10. We arrived around 5-ish for dinner and started with drinks and appetizers. The wine selection and service was good.   Some of our top picks for appetizers and there were many, were the Frog Legs which tasted better than chicken, the jar of King Crab,  Scallop Crudo, Parmesan Brussell Sprouts, and Hush Puppies.   For dinner, the Black Cod Miso; perfectly tender , moist and savory albeit rather small, and the Po'Boy sandwich ranked top of the charts.   And finally for dessert, the Beignets were good but personally I thought the Buttermilk Pie topped with blueberry sauce rocked the charts,   A great time was had by all. Thank you for a wonderful foodie adventure!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but really can't justify a good review after our experience. We had a reservation and were early on a Saturday  night. They weren't busy so seated us immediately. We waited 15 minutes after being seated until I had to get up and go to the host desk to ask if we had a server. He said yes, I sat back down and he came over 5 min later to bring us water. I asked him to speak to manager which he ignored....still no server. Finally server came about 10 minutes later. Seemed rushed and asked to take our drinks and food. Place wasnt even busy at this time. Overall after that service was decent. Food came out fast and was good not worth what they charge. I probably would have come back though for some if the service wasn't as horrible as it was. We felt like we were inconveniencing them that we were there."}
{"text":"Samantha...what a gal. Studious, attentive and just plain fantastic. Come in and see what all the guster everyone in town has been able to muster is about. Seafood. Smiles. It's got it all."}
{"text":"I would LOVE to give this great restaurant 5 stars and if you do, I wouldn't disagree. The strangest thing happened our last time there: We go for the king crab. Specifically the king crag in a jar. A very tasty side. However, the night of our anniversary, a reservation at 7:30pm, we were informed they were out of CIAJ. Very disappointing, but we were told we could order the main king crab dish... until 5 minutes later, when we were told they were also out of king crab... at 7:30. Typically we have a great meal here, just thought I would be detailed in this strange occurrence."}
{"text":"Have visited now fours times. A simple clean setting with great fresh seafood."}
{"text":"Interesting menu...delicious and didn't disappoint! Definitely have oysters & beignets!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service and very knowledgeable bartender/waiter. Will definitely visit this place again. Try the Oysters, they are fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Fox is sometimes too close to a national chain feel for me but in this city with very few really good seafood restaurants (not counting sushi), especially reasonably priced ones (Ocean Club aside)...wait, are there any??? There is now!    Between 5 of us we tried alot and all loved our food- Blue Crab Toast, Hushpuppies, Cajun Shrimp, Quinoa Salad, Oysters and the signature cocktails were stand-outs..all delicious! Our server was quite attentive and the mood/decor was fun & different.    We didn't get a chance to hang out in The Yard but have heard it is very fun- will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  They have lots of kinds of oysters to choose from.  I'm not a fan of raw oysters so they made mine into oysters Rockefeller even though it's not on the menu.  I like hanging out in the center of all the restaurants."}
{"text":"I do believe this could be the culinary high-point for the entire year!!!  First, if you haven't visited The Yard - it's a MUST GO!  It's a sizeable venue with a huge outdoor (but covered) activity area including pool, bean bag toss, and other yard games.  There's an overabundance of comfy seating and Adirondack chairs - and the people watching is outstanding.  We went on a Saturday night and the place was HOPPING.    There are three restaurants at The Yard - we went to Little Cleo's and it was a superb choice!  Although you could elect to sit on their patio and take in the people-watching, we sat at the counter where we had a ring-side seat to the operations of the kitchen and the staff - and it was mesmerizing.  There were two of us - so this was easy to do.  We started with fresh oysters which were delightful - the yummy and fresh taste of the ocean just like you'd expect, but tends to surprise given the Arizona location.  From there, we moved onto the singly, most decadent dish of the night - a JAR of King Crab chunks drowning in butter.  Seriously - like kids in a candy store and no rules.  Clogged arteries maybe - but this might be the best way to die a day earlier.  Next we shared a Shrimp Po' Boy - I'm not an expert on these having only had maybe one or two before - but it was good.  Next time though, I definitely am aiming for the Maine Lobster Roll.  For dessert we had a banana tart with hazelnut ice cream and nice black coffee.    The wait staff was superb.  It was fun to watch the guy conducting the delivery of the food - he didn't say a word, he only stood by the counter and when a dish was up, he raised his hand. Whichever staff saw him first, ran over and delivered it.  It was impressive how well it worked.  This is a definite to repeat...and repeat again!  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding! I highly recommend the oysters (east and west coast, personally I like the west coast better -saltier) I brought my girl and she doesn't even enjoy oysters and after she was persuaded into trying them, even she loved them!!! Not very large in size, however they make up for the size in how fresh and tasty they are.   Other than that, the octopus as an appetizer is always a win! Small, elegant, light, and explosive with flavor. The spice of the sliced beets and the compliment of the chewy octopus blends together nicely.   We then tried the Squid Ink linguine and the bouillabaisse was to die for. My personal favorite was the bouillabaisse. But the squid inks hot flavor really makes a great addition to the sauce that it is complimented with.   And yet... the beignets... well to be honest, there still arriving, so I guess you'll have to finish the review yourself...  Key points?   -Casey was about 60% of the experience. Very attentive, kind and gave us the inside tip on what his favorites were. Tip him well, or we will find you! ;) you know who you are...Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Everything was sooooo fresh! I had the shrimp, oyters, bacon & egg toast, clam chowder, salmon and steak. Definitely will visit again since I went on Valentine's night and there was a limited menu for the holiday."}
{"text":"Omg!!! I haven't been to Little Cleos until today.  Have been to Culinary Drop Out... located in the same place....THE YARD.  Being the 4 th of the July... we decided to give it a try. Not even knowing that they were offering 20% the entire bill because of the holiday.  The service is/was Amazing. I like that all the servers attend to everyone.  The food.... well ... exquisite us the only word that comes to mind.  Started with the Happy Hour Champagne and the King Crab in a mason jar with clarified Butter. Served with grilled toast. Dear Lord... sinful!  HD the octopus with cannelloni beans and fried onions.  And the shrimp po boy. Honestly... I would get the same things and maybe more! Thank you for the incredible service and food. You guys rock!!"}
{"text":"I have walked by this place many times while going to The Yard or Culinary Dropout and never thought to try it out until yesterday. We had heard they have a killer happy hour of $1 oysters/shrimp and $2 champagne. Although we didn't make the happy hour, the prices were reasonable and the food was great. If you are a fan of ahi you have to try the tartare! Very clean place, friendly staff and great feel overall. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I made a reservation for our Anniversary here, The atmosohere is vary retro style and the outdoor patio area is perfect seating for this time of year. I had the New York strip steak, it tasted great and well prepared, my wife had the Sea food platter and she loved it! If your looking for a great dining experience check this place out!"}
{"text":"Look like I forgot to finishing posting this review. Oops.  My boyfriend and I came here for restaurant week for their summer tasting menu. It was $33/person for 3.5 courses  (regularly $35 *ps If we knew that earlier we would have came earlier LOL). We started off with the shrimp cocktail and oysters and shared so we got one of each. That's the .5 course. Next we had the frog legs and grilled octopus followed by the main course of bouillabaisse and mussels with squid ink pasta finished with a toffee pudding and a lemon icebox pie.   Everything was delicious. The food came out at the right time giving you the perfect balance of time to eat and enjoy and not going savage waiting for the next course. The plates were the perfectly portioned to give you enough to experience the food but not gorge youself and definitely can fit all 3.5 courses with feeling like you should diet for the next month. The wait staff was friendly and hostess sat us right away with our reservations (ps make reservations).  The summer tasting menu or restaurant week (both limited time) are great ways to try the culinary delights of Little Cleo's  on a budget."}
{"text":"Little Cleo's is literally a hidden gem!  Tucked away in the same building neighbored by The Yard, Culinary Dropout and Barrio Urbano do yourself a favor and go here- especially so if you love seafood! Now, now, we have all heard and thought of the eyebrow raising idea of having seafood in the desert- let alone fresh seafood, but after dining here I nearly forgot I wasn't on the coast!  The place dons high ceilings, an open oyster bar, nautical themed type decor and has plenty of seating indoors and outdoors. With it being National Oyster Day and no prior reservations, I was seated promptly at the bar with my friend. I started off with a Sauvigon Blanc from Long Meadow Ranch (Napa Valley, CA), a dozen oysters for me with a side of garlic fries. The side of fries is because I get weak in the knees for carbs and all things garlic, in retrospect it is a bit strange and overpowering after a light wine and delicate oysters ...  The wine was great with the oysters, fresh and fruity. Peachy, stone -fruit type notes and citrus, it has a tartness and acidic quality which was a great pair to the raw oysters. The oysters provided during their $1 oyster special were the Blue Points. The oysters were fresh, had a little bit of a bite to them, juicy and clean tasting. Definitely for those with a liking towards sweet, clean and soft textured oysters. The only downside was that some oysters were tiny, but that was fine especially being $1 and all. The cocktail sauce and mignonette sauce I could do without, I love plain lemon and horseradish if need be. Get their extra spicy horseradish, it'll knock you the shuck out! It's great! The Garlic Fries were thick cut fries with a thick exterior and fluffy interior, strongly of garlic and served with a Rooster Aioli. Not bad, but not amazing.  Service was good considering it was National Oyster Day and the quality and price point were fantastic! Though, another mishap was that I was charged a few bucks more than my friend and I had originally tipped. Please check your charge statement folks! Besides that I'll definitely be back as I heard they do offer $1 oysters for HH and the rest of the menu looks lovely.   Complimentary Valet out back, please do not park in the residential areas."}
{"text":"I really doubt you'll be able to find a better deal for fresh oysters in the phx metro area better than Little Cleo's. During the summer their $1 oysters happy hour extends to two hours and it's pretty much the go-to place for me during that time. Their oysters are incredibly fresh. They tend to fall on the smaller side, which I like. It comes with the standard cocktail sauce and mignonette sauce.  They've also got a champagne that's good but powerful. I remember it was called Wycliff. It was on the dry side and stronger than most champagnes and prosecco I've had in the past. Their absinthe cocktails are tasty and creative, definitely worth a taste during happy hour when they're half off, as well as the classic kir royale for those who don't like absinthe.  If you're cautious about raw oysters, this is actually a great place to try them. The oyster size is less daunting than the plumper raw oysters that some places serve. They also have fresh shrimp for $1 each. I've had that and it's good, but in my opinion it's expensive for a tail of shrimp.    Overall, Little Cleo's is one of the best spots to dine for fresh seafood. The shellfish and seafood is flown in daily from both coasts. The ambiance is clean and inviting, sporting a nautical theme that calls back to fish markets and submarines."}
{"text":"Wow!! Amazing oysters!! So fresh!! Got the seafood platter after a few drinks as a snack...ridiculously happy with it!! The lobster was fresh...king crab was tender and the shrimp was reasonable. The British Columbia oysters were perfect!! Nice spot...great location for after drink snack that's not fast food!!"}
{"text":"Have you met the newest addition to The Fox Family? Little Cleo's Seafood Legend is in the yard. This place will put a smile on your face.   The first thing I do at any restaurant is to look over the beer garden, well now look at this. Humboldt Brown \"Hemp Ale\" 12 oz $6. You just have to wonder what the brew masters were shoveling into the tanks, over there, in Humboldt, California.  But I give in, to a glass of Austria's Gruner Veltliner because of its fantastic pairing ability and refreshing, medium-bodied, peppery white wine. $10  My seafood bar neighbor was having the oysters and they looked really good. The market price is up on the blackboard alerts. As I was studying the menu, http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Little_Cloe_Full_Menu.pdf I ordered the cold shrimp and that came with an excellent horseradish cocktail sauce. $13. At home in the summer, I love to eat super cold, nearly frozen shrimp and it is getting warm enough now, that I will be eating more cold foods for meals.  I also ordered the cold quinoa salad (pron. ki:nwa), baby beets, avocado, pine nuts, honey Greek yogurt. I was in the mood for the zesty, colorful beets nestled with smooth avocado and quinoa, all laying on a bed of creamy yogurt. This plate was excellent. $10.  I saw a group of staff with their leadership tasting a grilled Loup de Mer with artichokes & lemon $31. I was able to watch the chef work his stove and saute this delicacy. I couldn't hear what they were discussing but I believe they were talking about preparing and presentation of the European sweet seabass.   In closing I want to remark about the ambience. The music was 40's with musicians like Glen Miller or Bing Crosby. The architecture was more of a relaxed indoor, French style bistro with some swank. The staff all hip, some with tats, many with blue head rags. They were kind and all looked good."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Been here quite a few times but always come here for Restaurant Week.  This is one of Fox's best concepts, and during Restaurant Week, you absolutely get one of the best values of ANY of the restaurants that are participating.  Let me put it this way, if you order correctly, you can get a basically $50 meal for $33, a 34% savings.  You can't beta that at any other restaurant.  Generally speaking, this is a very good raw bar.  Not one of the absolute best, the variety is lacking, but they shuck oysters expertly without spilling out all the liquor, and that's a great start.  (See reviews for Hog Island and 167 Raw if you want.)  This time around we ordered the frog legs (which we always get), the sturgeon \"bacon and eggs,\" the \"bouillabaisse,\" ahi tune, banoffee tort, and apple cobbler.    The frog legs have always been good here.  Serves kind of \"Sichuan\" style, they're crispy and spicy.  I've ordered the \"bacon and eggs\" before and they are fine, I should have stuck with the frog legs.  The egg adds nice richness but there's nothing special about the sturgeon.  I also should not have ordered the ahi tuna.  It was seared over a grill, and it was under-seasoned.  At least they weren't over-cooked.  They weren't bad, but not great.  The \"bouillabaisse\" was a better dish, lots of shellfish with some grilled toast to sop up the broth.  Probably in quotes because its atypical i that there was no bone fish in the dish and the shellfish were served in the broth, but it was serviceable and not lacking in size.  The banoffee tort was better than the apple cobbler.  (I chose poorly this night.)  The tort was actually quite delicious.  Tasted like England.  The apple cobbler, again, was not bad, but just a little unbalanced.  On a side note, if you see that they have a buttermilk pie, which is not the menu this time, just get it.  It is excellent, one of the better desserts in the Valley.  So if you're looking for a deal, they're offering the Restaurant Week menu all summer.  They also have $1 oyster happy hour, but their happy hour is only from 4-5.  (Boooo.)"}
{"text":"First off, I need to give a shout out to our little gem of a server, Shad. Even if the food was a 2, I would still come back just because of him. He was slammed busy having the entire patio to himself (10 tables on a Saturday night) and was so attentive to rotate through every few minutes and ask if everything was okay or if there was anything we needed;  even if his arms were stacked with a load of plates. He even comped us each a glass of wine because he accidentally fired our dessert to soon and it came out when we still were on our meals.   In terms of the ambiance, it is a little small inside and is set up mainly with bar stools at the half bar/seafood station. Their patio however is amazing. And on the weekends there is live music which is another bonus.  For appetizers we had the shrimp & oysters and frog legs. Both were good choices, however the meat on the frog legs was a little scarce. Perhaps my luck of the draw was getting a baby frog. In lieu of that, the spices and sauce were on point.   For dinner I had the bouibollise and the asparagus with truffle oil. Both were supper yum.  For dessert we had the buttermilk pie. It had a lemony taste to it with a blueberry compote on it. It was amazing. Not super sweet and the perfect dessert to end a great meal.  I will be back since I had my eye on the King crab jar, but sadly my dinner date doesn't eat shellfish."}
{"text":"- Design, build out and atmosphere is really good  - Hostess was very friendly and accommodating  - Waiter was real pushy but attentive and accurate  - Blue crab toast tastes like a good tuna sandwich, not blue crab  - Octopus was a good presentation but just OK as a dish - Kale Salad was the best thing we ordered - Shrimp Po-boy was pretty legit and I'd get it again   Overall, good but not excellent. I'd have a hard time recommending for the price point."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and made it official one of my favorite places to eat..   Tonights dinner was great:  British Columbia Oysters Shrimp  Hush puppies  Big blue crab jar and butter (forgot the official name)    \"Eggs and ham\"  NY steak  Malbec and death in the afternoon for drinks...  There was two people for all of this food!   Crazy! But yummy!   Was my friends first time here so I felt the need to get a selection of different things but then share it all..   Been going here regularly there are some thing you just have to get and so we did.  All in all you cant go wrong with anything."}
{"text":"Nice little spot with people who truly care about the food they serve and the service they provide. We decided to pick a new place on Yelp and chose Little Cleo's. Glad we did! They have a small but unique menu. We tried the frog legs.....crispy little legs that were simply delicious with a very little kick, we were quite surprised how good and crispy they were.  The corn side dish was simply divine I could just eat a bowl of it. The shrimp creole was good and although they said spicy and I don't like spicy i didn't find it really was. My husband had the king crab and loved it and the cocktail was nice.  One of the things I liked best was the chef took pride in his food, the staff was knowledgable about the dishes and seemed to care about the food they served. We felt like we were eating something that care and designful thought went into.  My husband doesn't like to dress up for dinner so this low key place where you can chat, even though the chairs are stainless steel, was a nice place to go."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite spot for seafood period. The service is rockin. They really know how to take care of you. The shrimp po boy is the best in town. Oysters flown in daily. Craft beer selection. The vegetable dishes are amazing. Try the mushroom, corn, or asparagus, which are seasonal as well. The only Sam fox restaurant that completely kills it. I've thoroughly enjoyed everything I've eaten here. Chefs are rad...don't forget to buy the kitchen a beer for 2$."}
{"text":"Superb evening at Little Cleos. I brought a friend in for the first time and we both enjoyed every minute of our time there. Sam took such great care of us, while being hospitable and efficient throughout the evening. All of our food was fantastic, ambiance and service couldn't have been better. I will always recommend Little Cleos for extraordinary food and service. Thanks Sam"}
{"text":"Our server Casey was incredibe- informative, educated and helpful!  The food is great and it pairs well with the ambience of the yard.  Special orders don't throw off little cleos game at all.  Food is delicious and well priced!"}
{"text":"Spending a bunch of my life living in San Diego I have always stayed away from seafood in landlocked cities like PHX. I became a huge seafood snob. Little Cleo's was one of the few seafood places I have tried in the valley. I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the fish and crab were. Fish was light and flaky and didn't have the frozen fish taste. The warm jar of King Crab and butter was phenomenal! Loved the decor and felt like I was at an oyster house on the east coast. Little Cleo's deserves the 4 1/2 stars. Thank's again Yelpers for the spot on ratings."}
{"text":"The place was located inside \"The Yard\" which had a nice vibe to it and had a pretty hip and lovely crowd. While eating in the restaurant we were greeted promptly and the server was extremely thoughtful and helpful. We tried the grilled octopus which was over kidney beans and a sauce which was really good. Better than most places I have had. For our main courses we were presented with the salmon entree and a seafood dish that was like a stew(started with a B) but overall the food was absolutely amazing and was very well seasoned. Will definitely be coming here again and spreading the word on this"}
{"text":"What a totally cool concept.  Adult fun and games with fine food.  They even had frog legs which is a Midwest delicacy that I cannot find in Az.  We went during restaurant week and the place was packed.  The only downside is valet parking was full so we had to park a block away."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals on oysters and omg amazing $2 glass of champagne ! Amazing crab butter dip- just order it! I will return , but on HH deals only!"}
{"text":"OH BOY!!!! This place exceeded my expectations!!  I made reservations for my 29th birthday after reading reviews about the place. Let me tell you this.....I had my stomach set for the Brussel sprouts, but they were all out :(. I reluctantly choose the black kale salad, and I was blown away!! King crab in a jar and the Frog legs are to DIE FOR!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and they are always give awesome service and such great food! The first time we had a reservation and they were so busy we waited ten minutes for our table (not a big deal) so they gave us each a glass of complimentary champagne! Everything I've had hits the spot when I want seafood"}
{"text":"Fantastic oyster selection! I had the lobster roll and fries - lobster roll was decent but the fries were fantastic! My fiancé had the bouillabaisse and was raving about it! We also shared the bacon and eggs sturgeon - I've never had anything like it! So good! Overall, I'd highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bouillabaisse, scallops, mussels, shrimp, tomato, fennel, saffron...Seared Ahi.....Oysters...everything was delicious.  The service was over the top. THANKS Cameron for the great service. He went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on 6/23.  Had a 5:00 RSVP and we were seated right away.  Waited 15 minutes for a server... no dice.  Asked the hostess for help getting a server.  5 minutes pass and still no help.  Our party stands up and starts to leave.  Our server comes by and gives us some nonsense about not knowing we were there and apologizes.  We sit back down and order our drinks and dinner.  12 minutes later (32 minutes in) water and drinks arrive... 32 minutes without water... busch league.  Appetizers arrive 1 minute later.  The apps all taste very good.  25 minutes later entrees arrive.  They are edible but generally low quality.  We finish our entrees.  After having an empty plate in front of me for 15 minutes I put in on the table next to ours.  The balance of my party does likewise.  Right after we bus our own plates the deserts we already ordered arrive (in retrospect we all would have passed on desert but we had already ordered desert with our entree selections in an attempt to make things more efficient).  I ask for the bill.  She brings the bill right away.  Desserts taste good.  We finish dessert.  We again bus our plates to the neighboring table after a decent wait.  Finally someone takes the bill and we settle up.  We leave...  2 hours a 5 minutes later.  This is consistent with my typical Fox Restaurant experience.  In my experience Fox restaurants are contrived concepts staffed by attractive servers with value engineered menus.  They are basically a bootleg version Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises (out of Chicago).  FYI... LEYE is not a high bar to reach or even a good place to start from."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. We talk about it all the time. Food is fantastic and we have had nothing but great customer service. The menu is incredible and the wait staff is knowledgeable. I highly recommend the scallop crudo!!!  PS. Bring a jacket, its a little chilly in there ;)"}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend who was very happy with both their experience and their meal. When my husband and I arrived we were quickly with to an outside table we did not have to wait at all even though it was a Friday night. We ordered a couple of cocktails they really weren't that great I think mine was something like a margarita and his was something like a Moscow Mule. We drank them anyway. We had a half dozen oysters and that was absolutely the best thing we could have ever ordered! They were so tasty we should have ordered a dozen but wanted to keep our appetite. We review the menu several times small plates large plates the prices were kind of steep to me. We ended up deciding on  the fish and chips and I ordered the seafood stew. I wanted to do the warm job crab but did not think it would be enough to fill me up. Seafood stew was delicious I absolutely loved it the scallops for perfect probably the best scallops I've ever had. I savored every moment of that dish and would definitely order it again. My husband's fish and chips on the other hand were lackluster. Not very much food and nothing to write home about. I think he got a total of seven fries and when we asked about the portion that said that's what it comes with if we wanted more we would have to order them and pay for them. That really was not cool with us because it's basically a potato folks. Overall I would give this restaurant high points  if you're looking for a nice date spot and  want to have some good seafood. But I would skip the fish and chips as you could pick up a much better portion anywhere in the city. The pricing is kind of high and I think next time we'll go there have a cocktail maybe something more simple or a glass of wine and just eat a little bit for the Ambiance but it would not be a dinner spot for me. We ended up spending $100 and we had two drinks a half dozen oysters fish and chips and the stew. If the portions were larger it would not have been so bad oh I did bring home one slice of pecan pie and it is much smaller than I expected. Couple that with a tip because the waitress has no control over the price of things and I thought that we spent a lot more than we expected. Again if the portions were larger I would have had no problem with it thus to that was a good portion the fish and chips that was horrible and the coleslaw was completely dry. When we mentioned it to the waitress she kind of just Shrugged her arms no offer to switch it out or do anything about it. Look I've been in Dives that have been more attentive if the food is not right that part really was not cool. The waitress apologized several times for the fish and chip portion to that made me think we aren't the first ones to say something about it."}
{"text":"Little Cleo's Seafood was LEGENDARY...  Daily Oysters cocktail and mignonette - IMMEDIATELY took me to the white sand shores of Maui Hawaii, man I was there instantly!!!  Salt water and all, clear the sinus, bask in glory.  I had 5 down in record time swapping between the sauces.  Crispy Frog Legs fish sauce, roasted cashew, Thai chili sap - DAMN this was GOOOOOD.  Hop away little froggies while you can cause I'm coming back for more.  Finish up - Warm jar of King Crab & butter with grilled bread!  OMFG - Amazing!!!  Service and atmosphere - excellent.   Clean co-ed washrooms @ the Yard.  I'll be back to order all of the above as well recommend them all to you."}
{"text":"My dad and I are from out of state and decided to try something good during our stay in Arizona. Little Cleo's was so amazing! Service was excellent, and the food was even more amazing!   Had their top tier oysters (don't remember how to spell what type but they were from British Columbia). The oysters were so fresh and tasty! I wish I could go back and eat more. Ha ha. If you come here, definitely get oysters!   We also had the crispy frog legs, jar of crabs, and the kale salad. Everything delicious! I especially liked the frog legs! Being Chinese, frog legs aren't foreign to me, but Little Cleo's really spiced them up!   We also had the buttermilk pie. It was okay, but not my favorite.   Word of warning: if you have never been to area, the building is a little confusing. The whole building is called \"The Yard.\" The Yard has 3 restaurants with the building, which is really cool but confusing for newcomers. We bumped into people who were just as confused as us!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little seafood restaurant and I'm not kidding, it has one of the best oyster bars I have encountered.  My family insists that we go there every time we are in Phoenix.  We have been there now 5 times in summer, spring, fall and winter and it does not seem to matter, it is consistently very good.  The service is always exceptional and the food, not just the oysters is very good.  The last time we were there my wife and I had two dozen oysters during happy hour (4-5 pm) which is awesome because they are $1 each.  We stayed for dinner and my wife had crab legs and I had the lobster roll.  The legs were awesome and the lobster roll, though not the best I have ever had, was still very good and worth a try if you are lobster roll lover as I am.  We like to sit at the bar because you can watch the chefs prepare the dishes and do other prep jobs.  This is fun if you are a foodie like we are.  They have a pretty good selection of wine and beer and some cool absinth drinks if you are in to that.  Everyone that works there is very friendly and engaging.  We always leave happy."}
{"text":"Black Kale salad, wow.  Divers scallop crudo. Really good.  Excellent Brown ale.  It was fun to sit at the bar and watch them prepare the food.  Top quality seafood here."}
{"text":"Phenomenal birthday dinner. Cute restaurant at the Yard. Made reservations for 4 for a Saturday night at 5:30. Glad we decided on early...was already getting busy.. Parked the car at the free valet....nice. Started with a few drinks and appetizers. The guys had a medley of oysters which they said were good. Also tried the garlic bread, the octopus and the black kale salad. All yummy. The octopus served in a tasty sauce and cooked perfectly-not chewy. And the kale salad was great. As it was my birthday, I went with the king crab legs. Others had Cajun shrimp, bouillabaisse, and the fish and chips. All of the dishes looked so good. My crab was excellent. Maybe steamed then finished off with a quick grill. It was a good serving, stayed hot and was nice and sweet. So good dipped in the side of herbed, melted butter. Best crab I have had in a long time.  Our party was celebrating 2 birthdays, so we went with 2 desserts, the buttermilk pie and the pumpkin fritters..both yummy and enough to share. And desserts were on the house, even better. Service was also good, our waitress was very knowledgeable and knew everything about the food and menu. Food came out quickly and was a great atmosphere in the restaurant as well as outside in the yard. We played a few games outside in the yard after dinner as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went down the street to Little Cleo's this evening for dinner.  The parking (as usual) was a chaos around the Yard, and the neighborhood now had lighted signs saying that the parked vehicles will be issued a ticket (can't blame the neighbors).  The valet service is complimentary, and the guys working at the booth are always super friendly.  My valet ticket got lost in the restaurant today, and the guys did not give me a hard time at all.    We entered the restaurant around 5:45 on a Friday, and it was not busy.  We ordered the warm jar of king crab and bread, some oysters from New England and California, and the bouillabasse.    The warm jar of king crab was sweet and loaded with butter.  It is one of those love and hate relationships where it starts off so good then the butter just overloads you over time.   The oysters are on the more expensive side, but they are flown in from their respective waters daily - I suppose we are paying for their airfare.  That thought tends to make me feel better about the money I'm spending.    The best part of the meal was the bouillabasse.  The creamy tomato sauce over fresh scallops, shrimp, mussels and salmon was really to die for.         Loved the staff that was working tonight at the restaurant.  All of them were upbeat and looked like they wanted to be there.  They are also handing out 25% off coupons to use for the month of January.  So, get there fast!"}
{"text":"Great food here,  tuna tartare asian in flavor with the addition of toasted garlic  and the contrast with the crunchy cucumber great. Had the yams with a smoky sauce and dates wow!  The loupe de mer was split and grilled  perfectly.  The Cajun shrimp were plentiful  the little potatoes a perfect contrast and the grilled bread to soak up the great smoky sauce brilliant."}
{"text":"My father-in-law was visiting from CT. and both him and my husband love seafood so found Little Cleo's on yelp and decided to try it out. Parking is insane, so we went with the complimentary valet. I really liked the open atmosphere of the place and service was fast and friendly. I was not impressed with the menu.They have what's called a small plate and large plate option and it seemed the only way to get crab legs was on the large plate option and was basically $40 a plate. Didn't really say anything was with it or the size of the portion. The small plate had crab in a jar which didn't sound too appetizing. They only had one steak on the menu so I went with it, the new york strip and potatoe rosti. My meat wasn't cooked right and sat on what I can only describe as overcooked hashbrowns that were to crunchy to eat. I asked for a long island and they said they don't normally make them but they could make one for me.? Ended up ordering the sour cherry paloma off thier spirits list which was amazing! Im giving 4 stars because the seafood lovers I were with, both ordered the bouillabaisse and said it was amazing. Also Im not going to base my review off a steak. Its obvious Im too redneck for a place like this anyways. lol..  The service was good and we all had a great time overall. :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food is delish.  the menu has a great variety and service is always on point.  looking for a happy hour spot, this is your place."}
{"text":"Came to Little Cleo's specifically for their new Happy Hour special of $1 Oysters and $1 shrimp and were quite pleased with that.  Normally I am a big fan of Sam Fox and his concepts but parts of this one were a bit dry.  First of all, as with all Sam Fox restaurants, loved the decor!  Beautiful place but very, very small.  We got there at 4 PM on a Friday and were set nearly on top of another small 2 top.  There were ample seats at the bar but sometimes you want to sit across from your honey and enjoy your meal.  Our server was polite and attentive to us, extra points for offer a purse stand instead of having me put my purse on the ground but the table next to me already had one and there wasn't much space between our tables anyways so I chose to set my purse under my chair.  The Happy hour special was great, we got 5 oysters and 10 shrimp for $15 which is a great deal.  The boy loved the oysters and homemade mignonette but I was left wanting with the cocktail sauce.  All I could taste was lemon (no horse radish, boo!) which was so potent it went to cleaner type taste.  I get that lemon and seafood go hand in hand but I use mine with a sparring hand so the over powering flavor was just blech.     We also ordered off the menu for the hush puppies, the asparagus, and the jar of warm crab.  The sides were great but the jar of warm crab was disappointing.  Was it tasty?  Yes!  Was it worth the $$$?  No!  It was a jar of butter and maybe, MAYBE one small king crab leg worth of meat.  Our attentive server was nice enough to ask us if we wanted more grilled bread to dip in the left over butter which was a nice touch.  Why not a 5 star review?  Something's just didn't match up.  The chill blues vibe in LC's was nice until you looked outside and saw the frat guy crowd at the Yard.  The co-wash room of the bathroom seems cute until you watch horrified men and small children not understand why they went through the Men/Women's door to see the opposite sex on the other side.  The HH specials food wise was nice but $2 champagne and  1/2 absinthe drinks left half of table paying full price for drinks.  Only 2 beers on draft with multiple empty taps?  No Bueno.  So here is where the #'s stack up:  Service: 5 (Yay!) Food:  3.5 Ambiance: 5 for LC, 2 for the rest of the \"Yard\" Value:  4 for HH, 2 for the Dinner/Drinks menu   Will we be back?  For happy hour, of course!  But probably not any other time."}
{"text":"Holy Heaven, thank you for the bountiful oysters bestowed upon me here. (Mind you, I haven't said a prayer since I was eight. Unless a Hail Mary when you're on a waiting list counts.)  Little Cleo's is a treat. On The Day oysters were ONE Dollar I stuffed my face here. (Why it can't be National Oyster Day everyday is just wrong.) How many oysters did I eat? 9 + 12. No, this isn't Common Core time. There were nine varieties to sample. I asked for two more of four (ok, this is sounding like a math question) but the order was fat fingered.   I ate in the name of science. Or, because the darn oysters are so delicious. (And yes it is humanly possible to eat that many oysters.)  Tucked inside The Yard, Little Cleo's offers refined dining. Perfect-O for a romantic moment. (And no, I was not hitting on Ursula D. while chugging wine. I'm probably not tall enough or something.)  Alas, there is no Happy Hour. But you can enjoy a HH drink before heading in at The Yard or Culinary Dropout!  Oysters are served with an apple vinegar and marina topped with shaved horseradish. I'm old school and prefer horseradish. When special requested a super secret mash was also offered. This stuff is HOT. Like HOT HOT HOT spicy. A tiny bit will go very far.   While hoovering food down cheesy garlic bread was had. My rubber arm was twisted when the suggestion came up. Spinach was cooked more than I prefer, but still a healthy option.  Reservations may be tight for groups. There are seats at the bar level and along the window. I'm not sure if these can be reserved.   There was one really quirky thing tho. Pepper. If you want any ask your server to bring over the pepper mill. Which they won't leave on the table. (Someone please smuggle in McDonald's pepper packets and report back. I'm sure that will go over well ;)"}
{"text":"Holy deliciousness! I have put off coming to Little Cleo's for a long time because I'm not generally a seafood lover and the place is a bit pricey. Anyway, I had a gift card so I decided it was as good a time as any to give them a try. I should have never hesitated in the first place. I made a reservation through open table and had no issue getting a table. The husband and I started with drinks. I had a drink that involved sparkling wine and fresh strawberries...it was so light and fresh... I loved it. I don't recall exactly what the husband had to drink, but I do remember that it was also tasty and tasted just like fall (you know, bourbon.... spices...tastiness).   The food was equally tasty. We started with the octopus, which was perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful. I had the mussels with the squid ink pasta..... this thing was amazing! I thought the mussels may be too fishy, but they weren't at all.... the entire dish was balanced. The pasta  melded with the tomato based sauce and the mussels. The portion was on the small side, but it was enough for one person. The husband had the fish and chips. He enjoyed them very much. The fish was light, crispy, and not overly fishy. The chips were crispy and flavorful. It also came with a refreshing slaw.    So all of this was nice...but you want to know the best part? When you buy 2 entrees, you get a free dessert with yelp check in. That's right! And the dessert is legit. We had the sticky toffee pudding with nutella gelato..... I dream about that dessert. It was insanity. I would go back to Little Cleo's for this dessert alone. Needless to say, will be back!   Oh and 1600!!!"}
{"text":"Easily our favorite seafood place in Arizona. It's hard to find genuinely delicious seafood here, but this place 100% nails it.   The restaurant is small, but the setting is beautiful old French themed, elegant, not at all tacky, has good ambiance and you feel good being there! The kitchen is open right in front of you, it's clean, and you can see everyone working and preparing FRESH delicious food!!   We always say we will try something different, but get the oysters every time! They are SOOO delicious!!!! Especially during happy hour: $1 oysters and shrimp, $2 champagne, 1/2 off drinks, wines and beer, and 1/2 off all absinthe drinks! (YES! Absinthe!) We are not a fan of the absinthe, but definitely a great place to try it, considering its very expensive and rare to find! We tried one that was recommended, $15, half off made it $7.50, we didn't like the taste, but we were glad we tried it and for only $7.50!  They also have small plates and large plates. We have also tried the frog legs (can you say yum?!), and the tuna tartar. Both very delicious!!! Everyone around you always seems to be enjoying the food as well! I don't know how you couldn't like this place!  Little amount of parking, but they have free valet so not a big deal. Located next to culinary dropout in the Yard, so tends to get busy, but don't let that turn you away!    Overall the experience here is wonderful. Every time I see a bad review of this place it makes me really sad because it truly is a gem, easily one of my favorite restaurants, best happy hour deals, and wonderful ambiance. They truly make you feel welcomed, we have been here 3 times and they remember us every time. I don't know how anyone with an open mind to trying new foods and places would ever have a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Just as you walk in from the parking lot of Culinary Drop Out, (a new Sam Fox project of mammoth proportions) and approach the hostess table, on your right side, you find yourself looking through a huge window into Little Cleo's. Looks like a classic dinner.  Subway tiles, old fashioned light fixtures, tables by the window, and a long bar overlooking the kitchen.  This place is spotless.  Clean, shiny, unpretentious, and comfy.  A quaint little eatery.    My girlfriend and I were there to have dinner at Culinary Drop Out with a group of friends (which we eventually did) but we got there first and there was at least a half hour wait.  So we decided to go into Little Cleo's and have a small bite or two while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  The service is impeccable.  Friendly, knowledgeable, professional staff who greet you with a smile, make great recommendations from the awesome menu, and a  are just as polite as can be.    We chatted up our server about the drink menu and he suggested I try the \"Subtle Menace\".  A potent, yet refreshing libation with gin, absinthe, sauv blanc, and lime.  Poured over ice it was absolutely delicious.  I felt the effects of that absinthe right away.  (To my Armenian friends, it tasted a bit like oghee).  My girl had the \"Sour Cherry Paloma\".  Top shelf tequila, veev acai, cherry bitters, and grapefruit juice.  Also, very refreshing, and very yummy.  Not quite as strong as my drink though.  Thank goodness.  Someone had to be responsible.  Then came the food.  WOW!!!  I was absolutely blown away.  We started off with the \"warm jar of king crab and butter with grilled bread\".  A small jar with succulent pieces of plump, sweet crab meat nestled in a slightly-more-than-warm bath of drawn butter, with just a hint of garlic.  Served along side a stack of rustic, crusty, toasted and buttered french bread.  I couldn't resist.  I stuck my fork in the jar, pulled out a mouthful of crab dripping with steamy melted butter, piled it on top of a piece of bread that i had dunked in the jar and shoved the whole think in my mouth.  Hey!  It's my birthday, I'll be obnoxious if i want to!  I was in culinary bliss.  Perfection!   Then came the  \"bacon & eggs\".  Get a load of this.  House made sturgeon (yeah, the fish) bacon, creme fraiche and toast topped with a sunny side up egg!  OOOOOOH, EMMMMMMMMMM, GEEEEEEEEEEE!  When i cut through the egg yolk, and that golden goodness oozed all over the crispy, buttered toast, i swear I had a culinary boner!  It was something i had never experienced before but cant wait to experience again.  Absolutely delicious.  Seasoned perfectly with the right amount of salt and pepper.  Sam Fox is a culinary titan in AZ.  He has so many eateries.  I've had the privilege to eat in several of them and none disappoint.  the next time I'm in AZ I'm going back to Little Cleo's for sure.  There is still a lot of menu that requires exploring!!  IF YOU LIKE SEAFOOD EVEN SLIGHTLY, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"Suckers for seafood, my best friend and I couldn't wait to take advantage of Restaurant Week and finally get to try Little Cleo's. We were not disappointed!   Loved the classy and chill vibe of the place, great date spot. We did the special menu plus the wine pairings and our waiter was great. I loved everything I had, from the oyster to frog legs to the salmon dish to the icebox pie for dessert and the wine pairings were an awesome addition. Even though we didn't care for the port that came with dessert, our waiter was so great, he noticed that and offered to get us another wine that we'd like more - so we got to enjoy an after-dinner Pinot Noir sample instead.   I can't wait to come back and try more of their amazing menu of fish flown in fresh daily and perhaps even some absinthe."}
{"text":"Cleo's is simply fantastic!! Its endless seafood options will leave you dizzy. I would recommend the fresh oysters with lemon - they are out of this world delicious. The crab legs served in a small plat option, along with the spinach salads complete a wonderful appetizer experience. I couldn't get enough of their overly fresh king crab legs so perfectly prepared, I ordered those in the entrée, only to be crazy surprised by my serving size and most importantly quality of crab legs. Our servers, both Jacob and Lennon, provided us service that I only experienced in NYC and San Francisco. Highly recommend Cleo's. Bon appetite!!!!"}
{"text":"wow.. super clean..fresh and $1 oysters and chilled shrimp for happy hour.  amazing quality and fantastic service.  Lenon was our Bartender/ Server and was amazing.  Really impresssed .highly recommend....and ABSINTHE!!  LOTS OF IT!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for anything but the awesome lack of parking. We made reservations which we cancelled after trying to park for twenty minutes. We weren't being parking snobs, I'd gladly walk. There was absolutely no parking unless you wanted to chance getting towed. Attached to Little Cleo's there are at least two other restaurants and parking for about fifty cars. Very poor execution."}
{"text":"This has become our new favorite place for date night. Imagine two, tired parents finally getting out. You hope for the food and service to be exceptional. And luckily, last night's experience was top notch. We took advantage of their summer special - 4 courses per person for $35. That's 8 tasty dishes in total. We started with shrimp and oysters, followed by crispy frog legs (big portion for what they call a 'small plate') and house made sturgeon bacon. Then for our main course, my favorite - bouillabaisse (what I call delicious seafood broth goodness)  and my husband had the squid ink linguine with mussels. Dessert was sticky toffee pudding with, wait for it...Nutella ice cream!!! And for him - lemon ice box pie. All of the above was presented nicely and tasted wonderful. Service was great. Kendra, who has only seen us once before remembered us and checked in to ensure all was good a couple of times, even though she wasn't even our server last night. Good job on all fronts! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Food is very good, staff  is friendly, attentive.  We went during Happy Hour....oysters $1.00, beer $2.00.  Since this was our first time, we tried several small plates as well as their oysters.  Oysters were fresh.  Food was absolutely delicious.  We even saved room for dessert! The staff was very good about recommendations from their menu."}
{"text":"Went with a friend on a Thursday night and it was moderately busy.  Loved the relaxed 'Yard' experience where you can get up and play ping pong or bags if you want.  The malbec wine I had was great - loved that.  The food presentation was exceptionally beautiful - some of the prettiest plating I've ever seen.  I was truly disappointed in the size of my entrée - the halibut which was listed under 'large plates' for something in the $25 range.  What I got was about a 3 inch wide by 1 inch tall square of fish sprinkled with a delectable topping.  It was divine but was certainly not what I consider 'large'.  There was nothing on the side - aka rice, veg or potato and the menu didn't really make it clear that it was basically a la carte style.  For dessert, we shared an order of beignets which came with a lick the bowl homemade caramel dipping sauce.  These were so yummy!  We accompanied dessert with decaf coffee which was some of the best decaf I've had a restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I and another couple went to Little Cleo's recently.  It was our first time there and everything was wonderful! Our waitress, I believe her name was Chanel, was so accomodating and sweet!  She was very attentive, described dishes thoroughly, and was prompt in bringing us anything we asked for.  As a person who has worked in the restaurant industry before, I was impressed with her service.  The food was also spectacular! I ordered the sea bass and my boyfriend got the king crab legs.  Both dishes were amazing!  We tried a couple of the appetizers as well: the frog legs (delish! kind of like chicken wings but much better), the octopus, and they gave us a complimentary egg and bacon brioche, which might have been my favorite. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend Little Cleos!"}
{"text":"We went here for the Happy Hour on my birthday. It was very good, I loved the absinthe drink and the oysters were good as well! The Garlic Bread is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Seafood was fantastic, great deserts, perfect service and a great selection of absinthe. Should get 5 stars but mandatory \"complimentary\" valet parking doesn't sit well with me.  And if that wasn't bad enough our seats, in our new car, were wet. When we called for an explanation the valet service stated it was their standard practice to put the windows down a bit to let some heat out.  First of all, these vehicles are not theirs so it isn't their decision. Second there are hundreds of cars so in case of rain I guess your car just gets wet.  We got a lot of excuses and maybe one real apology. Won't be back until parking is changed."}
{"text":"Stopped by with several friends for my husband's birthday and we couldn't have been happier. Sam, our server, was wonderful.  He brought drinks promptly even though it was packed.  Quite a contrasted from The Yard/Culinary Dropout where we tried to get a drink prior to Little Cleo's opening at 4pm. They couldn't get their act together and we were scolded by a server and a bartender for trying to get drinks.  Sam made up for everything!   It was a great couple of hours- thanks Sam!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the decor was cute. The chef himself delivered the meal to our table. Despite great atmosphere and good food our waitress really dropped the ball a few times. We finished our first cocktails and she came by and silently took our glasses without offering another cocktail. We thought no big deal... We figured she would come by again in a few minutes and we could just place another cocktail order. She did not come by for quite awhile.  Near the end of the meal (I was still eating my meal, fork in hand, and napkin in lap) she swooped down on the table, picked up my plate at the same time I was trying to stab another Brussels sprout. As an afterthought she asks, \"Is everyone done.\" I'm pretty sure I still had  Brussels sprout leaves on my lip...   They were not busy, there were plenty of empty tables. I'm not sure why letting us have another cocktail and actually finish our meal before picking up our plates was a problem but I was not impressed with her. (I don't know if us being a lovely lesbian couple was her problem or if we were just not their normal older clientele but she was not really interested in our money.)  I would totally go there again but I would go out of my way to get a different waitress."}
{"text":"Wow.  First visit to Little Cleo's.    The food was fantastic and service was great.   I had the fish tacos...literally the best fish tacos I have had.  Lemon and Lauren were fantastic servers.   Treat yourself to great food go to Little Cleo's Seafood Legend."}
{"text":"Came to Little Cleo's with my SO this past weekend and loved it!  First off, the vibe and décor are chic and cool. It's definitely an experience to dine on the (somewhat enclosed) patio in this beautiful weather.  Secondly, not much to say about the food other than... DELISH!   We ordered the hush puppies appetizer to start (they were phenomenoal) and each ordered the cajun shrimp as our main course. It came with shrimp, red potatoes, mini corn on the cob slices, and grilled bread.   This dish was really, really flavorful and yummy. Loved the grilled bread!  For dessert we had the lemon ice box pie and let me tell you...this pie was TO DIE! Yum and nom nom nomitty nom.   Um yeah we'll be back to Cleo's and we recommend you give it a try too!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Little Cleo's from the ambiance to service to the food and drinks.  My wife started with the kale salad and I had the King Crab salad (sans the crab).  Both were fantastic.    I went without the crab because we were having the Little Cleo's Shellfish Supreme platter to share as a main course.  I also ordered the hush puppies.  Having grown up in the south, I thought I'd tried all variations on hush puppies but I was wrong.  These were moist and doughy inside while still having a light cornmeal crust on the outside - outstanding.  And the seafood platter, well it was so tasty that I forgot to grab a photo for the review.    The staff was very friendly and attentive.  We sat at the bar which is open to the kitchen, and the kitchen runs quietly, but efficiently - a well oiled machine and not the usual barking of orders and chaos.  We will definitely be back next time we are in Phoenix and would love to have them open a Denver location."}
{"text":"Everything the 2 of us ordered here was excellent.  Friends got the lobster roll and shrimp po boy.  I got the special 4 course item with the shrimp, octopus, seafood bouillabaisse.  For desert we all got the waitress' recommendation of some peanut butter chocolate thin pie slice.  I forget the name but it was perfect, not too sweet, but just right.  Like the 3 bears porridge story.    The waitress was so friendly, funny, and great with recommendations. She checked back often, our beverages were kept full by her and other wait staff without having to ask.    We had tried the Culinary Dropout recently, but Little Cleo's topped there by far.  A bit pricier, but well worth it.  We sat outside and were lucky because although in the summer, it was shaded, and the misters work great out there.  Next time we may get a reservation inside because it will be quieter.  Outside is in that common courtyard with loud music, people playing those games, TVs, etc.  One small side note. Careful eating anything with the shells (mussels/clams) as broken shell pieces may be in there by accident.  I bit down on a tiny piece and I think i chipped off a small piece of a molar. :(    Wish I got the waitress' name, as she was excellent.  Highly recommend this place for seafood if you wallet allows.  My friend is very particular about her seafood rolls and she loved the lobster roll. :D  Easily 5 stars."}
{"text":"A bit confused as to how Little Cleo's got a four star rating but my experience wasn't quite there. We went there for what was advertised as Easter Sunday brunch which was a choice between two omelettes - not much of a brunch. We stay just the same and ordered what I would describe as small portions at a relatively high price. I should have been tipped off as we were the only two in the restaurant on Easter Sunday. Our first visit so it very well could have been a one-off. Disappointed to say the least"}
{"text":"A cutesy venue with a fantastic cocktail menu and yummy bites.  Often crazy busy, so make a reservation."}
{"text":"Lovely, Fox restaurants needs to fire their IT director and manager at little Cleos for losing our confirmed reservation and telling us tough."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing brunch at Little Cleo's. The outdoor patio was clean and nicely set with fresh flowers. The hostess and waitress greeted us right away and a fresh pour of champagne was offered at our table. Truly felt spoiled by the service experience. Hostess knew right away I needed a hook for my purse and when the sun started creeping over onto our table, we were offered a new position right away. We were truly treated like guests. The food was amazing. I didn't think to take pictures, I was having way too much fun with my adorable company. Oysters tasted fresh from the sea, like they just pulled them out and put them on the table. Crab legs were already cut, so no messy work was involved. There was a quinoa salad w avocado to die for and an egg scramble that was simply incredible. I loved this place and I will return."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Last night my wife and friends went out for restaurant week to Little Cleo's.  We had the best experience!  The staff was great, our server Joelle was fantastic and everyone was so positive!  We were treated so well and the food was really good!  5 stars!!!  We would highly recommend this place to others and definitely go back ourselves!!!  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Was there Friday night to celebrate a friend's birthday.   The service and atmosphere were good.  We sat inside.  The restaurant was impeccable.  Staff attentive.  We were greeted promptly as we entered.   Food-wise: birthday gal had the bouillabaise (great).  Partner had the fish & chips (good, but nothing out of ordinary), well fried with a light, crispy crust yet tender and moist inside.  I ordered the king crab salad, priced at $16.  It was served in a cereal-sized bowl.  Not a side-salad, not a larger salad.  Although presentation was fine, the king crab was ... well, in miniscule amounts. If one were to weigh the amount of king crab shreds/bits, it wouldn't amount to more than 2 ounces (pushing it).  I was disappointed.  The fish & chips were $18, and bouillabase $22 (?).   Would I come back or recommend it to anyone?  Nope.  Food looked so much better next door at Culinary Dropout."}
{"text":"My husband and I love their fish and chips plate.  We didn't care too much for the atmosphere inside, and it was a little fishy smelling, but all in all a good experience.  It's hard to find good fish and chips in the Valley, and this is probably the best we've experienced so far."}
{"text":"Fantastic every time. Happy hour is legit. $1 oysters and shrimp and $2 bubbles. Heaven on earth. Sticky toffee pudding was the best dessert I've ever had, maybe I was drunk, or maybe it was just that great. God bless America....and Sam fox. :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant reminded me of an old cafe style place. Went on a Friday at 8:30 pm and waited for 15 minutes. Ordered the Bacon & Eggs which is sturgeon and eggs over a thick slice of bread which was very good. The fish and chips was also a good choice and it was fresh and just out of the fryer.   The service was awesome, originally was seated at the bar against a window and could not hear the person next to me so I asked to be moved to a table and was reseated within 10 minutes.   The only negative thing is the lack of parking, be careful to street park and go to the valet if there are any spaces available."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it I suggest best save it for a special occasion for a couple or small group oysters are STARTING at $18.00 FOR 6 but I will say that the employee  are friendly and very helpful drink sections are great. The coolest part that there are three choices within the same build so after dinner you can step right out the door and enjoy a drink and play games at the Yard"}
{"text":"who says you can't have fresh seafood in the desert? Little Cleo's Im sure would beg to differ with whoever thinks that!   I absolutely adore this place! My husband and I have recently gottten on an oyster kick after a recent trip to Portland, Or. We've been craving the kind of oysters that have a name, and not just the last name 'shooter'. Little Cleo's has just that!  If  you are new to the oyster world, just ask for Chad (I think that's his name anyway! He is a tall, blonde guy with a friendly voice and helpful demeanor) . He is like the sommelier of oysters. (He was actually really good at helping us chose wines too!)   MMMM those Eastern's are so good! (more briny in flavor) This is making me want more oysters right now!  Besides the oysters, the food is excellent. The portion size, at least on the dishes I ordered, are excellent. I absolutely love the Bouillabaisse, it's soooooooooooo good. It's like the best seafood soup you will ever have, they LOAD it with tons of shellfish, and the fish is ah-MAZING. Usually, when I order seafood soups, such as cioppino, the fish is always overcooked and dry. Not so at Little Cleo's! they cook that fish to PERFECTION. These people definitely know how to do seafood right. Another favorite is the grilled octopus...OMG, if you don't like octopus, its probably because you haven't had it cooked right. Octopus when cooked correctly is NOT chewy.  I would say my only complaint, and it's a very small one, is that sometimes the food is a little salty. But really, compared to everything else, that's just knit-picking!  In the two times I have dinned here, service has been excellent. I would suggest making a reservation as the space is limited, and it does fill up on weekends!  Oh! and one more thing to my oyster lovers, oyster shooter happy hour is from 10-11pm, friday and saturday, all oysters are $1. They have to get rid of all the oysters by Sunday, since they are closed that day."}
