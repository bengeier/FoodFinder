{"text":"Don't eat here or order from here! Believe me, I've done both and both have left me disappointed. A couple of months ago I went here with friends. The food was alright, but underwhelming. The service, on the other hand, was pretty bad. We were pretty much the only people there (probably because everyone else knew to stay away) and when we sat down, we were given 3 menus for our 5 person table. Service throughout the entire experience was just terrible, and I wish I could remember more specifics. Fast-Forward to Saturday. At 10pm I ordered food through just-eat.ca and my order was accepted for 11pm delivery (the restaurant has to accept the order). Note that the restaurant closes at 11pm but that shouldn't be an issue because they accepted the order and are set up on just-eat to accept orders until 10:05 to allow for their 55 minute delivery time. I waited until 11:30; my food NEVER CAME. They did not call me or anything to say they weren't going to do my order. Although, the order was removed from my just-eat account without me even calling them, I'm still waiting for it to be removed from my pending transactions on my bank account. This is clearly the worst delivery experience I've ever had in this city because my food never even got delivered.  Don't order from here."}
{"text":"This place is basically your typical Chinese restaurant.  Decent food and quick service, but lacking in ambiance."}
{"text":"Second time eating Chinese in Montreal. Second time underwhelmed.  We passed up what turned out to be the top-rated Vietnamese in town to go a few doors down to sup at this place which was...really just average. Not bad, not great. Didn't puke it up later. That counts."}
{"text":"Came here during a hot summer night , tired from walking at the old port, suddenly hunger struck me like always, haven't been to Restaurant Hong Kong in so long. The place had down sized drastically and looks like a new owner all together. Ordered a fried rice and cantonese chow mein to share with my friend , the rice was fantastic and wow what a portion. The chow mein was equally as good but not as good as their rice, the ambiance was pretty depressing though but other than that you probably catch me back here again for the rice."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, despite the ambiance. It had good flavour, authenticity to Cantonese style food. WIll come again. THank you for the lovely evening."}
{"text":"I am very sorry to write a bad review of this place. But it just wasn't good. Oysters were old with shell pieces in them. The roast duck and  pork were also not fresh. I have heart burn and indegestion from eating there. This was one of my favorite cheap restaurants I could count on and visited on almost every trip. Still the same waiters but the food sucked."}
{"text":"This place was okay. It was a bit empty and it is touristy. I ordered the roast pork and noodles. It was good. About the same as any other Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"In terms of decor, the restaurant is a bit tired and could use a nice refresh.  That said, dine-in experience was decent with attentive service.  They had a few dim sum dishes that were pretty good (specifically enjoyed the shrimp dumpling, ha gou).  The wonton noodle soup was exactly as expected and the pork over rice was good.  No complaints, overall we were seated, placed our orders, and received food in a relatively timely fashion.  Nice lady."}
{"text":"on our first night in montreal, we were looking for a place to eat.  since the pho place across the street only accepted cash, we had to look elsewhere as we didn't exchange our money.   this place seemed decent and accepted credit cards.  at first glance, the place looked pretty authentic but i quickly noticed that majority of the patrons were not Asian.  Nevertheless, we were hungry so we gave it a shot.  we decided to get individual dishes since it was just the two of us and family style would've been too much food.  i got the wonton mein while my husband ordered the roast duck lo mein.  they then told us that they were out of roast duck so he got the chicken lo mein.   the food came pretty fast. my wonton mein was in a smaller bowl than i expected.  i usually get a much bigger portion but that's at other restaurants in Boston, SF, and NYC.  my husband's lo mein looked okay but i noticed that he kept adding soy sauce and hot sauce to it, and he barely touched it when i was done.  my wonton noodles were good, the broth was tasty but the wontons looked a bit undercooked.  since i'm pregnant, i have to be careful so i just ate the noodles and left the wontons.   afterwards, i asked my husband about his dish since he didn't get it wrapped up.  he said there was no taste, the noodles and chicken were slimy, plus there were no veggies in the dish.  he was very disappointed and hungry in the end."}
{"text":"This place has the worst Chinese food in town. You can actually taste the poor quality of ingredients they use. The sause base was horrible (clumps of starch in the sauce) and the shrimps were clearly expired and way too chewy.   On the wall is a discoloured (purple?) and low resolution print of what is supposed to be a typical Chinese landscape painting. It actually does more harm than good to the atmosphere, and is somewhat of an insult to the painting itself.   The waiters there were very rude. Being Chinese myself, I'm accustomed to the usual poor service you get from Chinese restaurants. I didn't expect them to greet me with a smile or anything, but the waiters here actually make an effort to ignore you. This place takes bad service to the next level.  I highly discourage going to this place. There are plenty of other good Chinese restaurants just down the road."}
{"text":"I had BBQ pork and BBQ spare ribs over rice....not bad...you really can not mess this plate much....good and quick....Cheap...good value..."}
{"text":"It's back.  Hooray!!!  I am an ex-Montrealer, now in Napa, after having lived five years in Hong Kong.  This Montreal restaurant was wonderful for 30 years and went sour in the last few years. Actually, it went all sweet, which was worse.  New owners have taken over and it's back to authentic and wonderful.  We had the lobster with ginger and shallots and it was the best ever.  There is a God, it's back."}
{"text":"This would be my third visit to this restaurant, this time under a whole new management. It had its better days. The food had changed, not for the worse nor for the good. The portions has reduced a lot since. Its been over 10yrs i last came here, I was a teenager with my parents having a delicious dinner one time under the old management, and I remember they had the best fried rice with a generous amount of shrimp and bbq pork pieces. Yummy. I guess this place has ran out its prime years. But still an ok place for a cheap meal."}
