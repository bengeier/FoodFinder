{"text":"Amazingly good smoked meat sandwiches and only $4.75. I try to visit every-time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a sandwich, but I got the duck with baugette bread and it wasnt very tasty.  I tried my dads roast beef sandwich and it didnt fair much better.   They didnt have fries, and the chips they gave us were baked and I HATE that.  The service was excellent, but thats about it."}
{"text":"I bought 4 Viennese Sausages (saucisses de Vienne) & 1 lb of Headcheese (Fromage de Tête). The sausages is so so but the headcheese is a total disaster. The headcheese usually is blended in the Gelatin but this time it was totally in GREASE, white grease so I can't even take the meat out, so I threw all the headcheese in the garbage. 9$ lost. Next time, I will stick to my German butcher on Cote-des-Neiges at Queen Mary."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Delicious sandwiches meets amazing (bilingual!) service. They don't skimp on the meat either. Most of the sandwiches are $6 (smoked meat, mix, sliced veal) but some are $4.50 (like veal sausage). Tax is included, and they'll take debit for purchases $5+. They come on a nice sesame bun with dijon or regular mustard, your choice. There's nowhere to sit but if you can't wait to eat there's a counter by the wall you can stand awkwardly next to while you try to eat your over-stuffed sandwich in a somewhat dignified way.   The grocery shop has lots of neat stuff too - jams, sauces, different kinds of rice.   Note, they are closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I usually get the sliced veal sandwich with dijon or the sausage sandwich with sauerkraut and dijon mustard. Simple, cheap and delicious. What more can you ask for? A veal sandwich and a black cherry soda came to $5.75 when I passed by Slovenia on Saturday.  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"La choucroute, les sandwichs, le service, les prix abordables  J'ai essayé le mélange spécia avec 5 sortes de viande fumée en étage. Un incontournable"}
{"text":"I want to lather my body in their dijon mustard and layer on their generous masses of meat on me.   One of my token spots I go to whenever in Montreal.   If you are in the mood for a wholesome \"snack\" then I implore you come here, order (French/English), also ask for a pickle, and then wolf down that motherrrrr. They never skimp out on the meat and the bread they use is just so damn perfect. I'd eat this everyday if I could.   Veal and spicy sausage are the two types of sandwiches I usually get - DO IT.   Beyond their exquisite sandwiches it is also a butchers shop and mini-general store.  Worth the visit, and surprise surprise, dessert is right across the street at Wawel for polish/eastern european goodies.   Make it happen!"}
{"text":"Si vous aimez les saucisses, vous allez aimez cette charcuterie, qui propose non seulement d'excellentes saucisses, mais une grande sélections de viandes et même quelques produits d'épicerie fine. Il s'agit d'une boucherie, donc il est possible de s'y procurer du canard, de multiples découpes de boeuf, de porc, etc. Cependant, il faut absolument que vous essayiez le sandwich à la saucisse piquante, qui coûte quelques dollars à peine, que propose l'établissement. Il en vaut la peine et, si vous passiez jusqu'alors un mauvaise journée, les saveurs de ce sandwich copieux vous ramèneront dans de meilleures dispositions."}
{"text":"We got take out sausage sandwiches, some marinated cabbage and some sausage.  The sausage sandwiches were divine, soooo good We made some cabbage stew with the cabbage and sausage, it was so goooooooood!  The only down side is that they do not have a sitting area.... but it's a grocery shop anyways"}
{"text":"I love this place, they always have nice and fresh cuts meats, blood sausage, smoked pork ribs, chops, you name it and they have it. They have a wide assortment of European foodstuff, imported cookies, cakes, spices, and also a deli section with very good smoked meat, sausages, hot dogs, all ready to eat and at very reasonable prices along with decent customer service."}
{"text":"There is always a long line to get a table, but that 's no surprise due to the location and the touristy thing to do. Ordered the smoked meat sandwich that the portion of the meat was a lot which made the taste of the sandwich very tasty. There is no time to sit around and chat who you go there with it's more of a eat your food and leave so they can sit the next group to eat. There aren't a lot of tables and you do have to share tables which I have no problems with. My over all experience was good and would probably get my food to go at their to go store right next door, but keep in mind even the to go store has a long line."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a Chowhounder for alternatives to Schwartz's.   I got the Smoked Meat sandwich, which is only $6. A very good deal compared with Schwartz's almost double price. The meat, however, is much lower quality. Imagine the corned beef deli slices served at the supermarket and this is Slovenia's meat. They do load it up, but quantity cannot replace high quality smoked meat.  I'm not entirely sure what they're serving was every smoked. The style is much more rubbery and squeaky than Schwartz's, as if it's been steamed/braised/brined/etc.. There is no crumbling or fattiness like Schwartz's.  If you're in town to visit and you want Montreal Smoked meat, this is not the place to stop. you need to walk 5 minutes to Schwartz's."}
{"text":"Slovenia est une bonne boucherie/charcuterie sur le boulevard St-Laurent qui existe depuis des années. Elle propose de la viande de qualité ainsi que des produits européens importés. J'y viens depuis des années particulièrement pour manger leurs sandwichs aux saucisses (4$) ou encore leur sandwich spécial. Ajoutez s'y de la choucroute en extra + moutarde, délicieux. Si vous êtes un amateur de viande, vous allez adorer, vous avez un petit comptoir pour manger sur place debout. L'endroit est un peu vétuste mais ça fait son charme. Prix abordables.   4/5 visité depuis les années '90"}
{"text":"From the outside, this place looks just like another Eastern European 'depanneur' selling miscellaneous grocery items like sauces, biscuits, chocolates, etc. Nothing interesting. But open that door, and you'll quickly find that it's a total meat haven reluctant vegetarians would hate to find themselves in. Ever since my Montréal born and bred buddy brought me here for the first time five years ago when I was new in town, I've been hooked with their `melange special' sandwich. My untrained eyes don't know what exactly goes in the melange, but when something tastes that good, who cares? What I do know is that there is layer upon layer of different kinds of juicy, thick, savoury ham - probably best ever $5 sandwich in Montréal?  My only warning is that you should watch the person preparing the sandwich. One time I was there, this lady took my cash and went on to make the sandwich... no gloves involved. I didn't get food poisoning, but it was gross enough for me to remember it to this day!"}
{"text":"Mise à part leurs charcuteries alléchante, j'aime bien magasiner chez eux des produits importés. Beaucoup de ce qu'ils vendent est pas cher et bon. Il n'y a pas énormément de produits frais et santé, mais pour des pâtisseries comme ma grand-mère slovène les faisait... ça vaut certainement une petite pause!"}
{"text":"Old Country    Fall apart, juicy meets smothered in saurkraut or whatever 'accoutrements' for a price that is in the vicinity of $5: fantastic.     Good butchery also goes on and you can buy assorted condiments from the old world that you may have a hard time finding at other establishments.    Courteous, polite, hard working, eastern European folk, who take pride in their craft. What more could you ask for in a sandwich?    I'll have the spicy mustard, please.  Waka Waka"}
