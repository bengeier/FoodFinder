{"text":"Wow, best dang burger!!! Get the beast, omergerd!!! This is the pot of gold at the end of a dark and contaminated rainbow.  After a long night of being humped and grinded on by degenerate girls full of plastic and daddy issues, this was my nirvana.  It tasted better than the silicon titty that was in my mouth the night before. I only wish it were in Dallas."}
{"text":"So the first time i eat here i got just a cheese burger as i normally  dont care for these \"designer burgers\" and the bill came to 19.00 for a burger and taters ,  drink
Which they said the tater where famous lol tasted like macain frozen  tater to me. The cheese burger was meh so i said I would never go back for a 20 dollar burger that was meh. Then a friend at work told me to try the thanksgiving day burger. A well seasoned turkey sandwiched between STUFFING and MASHED SWEET PATATOES AND CRANBERRY JELLY  amazing also again almost 20 bucks but worth every bite . But due to price of a regular  cheese burger  i will only come back for the \"Thanksgiving day\"  if you are going to eat here you better have deep pockets like a movie star"}
{"text":"Had the Thanksgiving turkey burger. Burger didn't taste fresh. In fact, the burger came out in record time which further makes me believe it wasn't fresh. There was very little sauce and stuffing in the burger. The sweet potato tots weren't cooked thoroughly either. In conclusion, there are better options in the city for the price point that Wahlburgers is in."}
{"text":"Had to try Wahlburgers in town since I had seen the show many times. However the burgers are overpriced for the size and without any sides being included. The burger tasted fine, nothing extraordinary, and lacked any reason to come back. The service was subpar hostess was very nice but our waitress was not friendly nor attentive. The manager that was featured on the show, never asked us how our meal was as she was on her phone for a majority of our visit. I would not recommend visiting, just take a picture outside."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. Burgers were alright, beer selection was good. Sweet potato tots were meh. Quite pricey for what it is. I'd take a Big Smoke or Burgers Priest over this any day. Glad to have tried it once."}
{"text":"Good food. Burger and sloppy Joes were very tasty. Food came out quickly. Only giving a 3 star review because of the service. Servers did not smile, not friendly. Took away from the experience."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome. We are having a bad day and getting held in Canada over night because of terrible porter airlines, thank goodness that we found this place and had an awesome waitress that explained a lot out the restaurant and about the history of it. She was great. And the food was great, fast and reasonable prices. Thank you."}
{"text":"The burgers were good. The service and facilities, not so much. Not even restrooms for paying customers. They send you outside to a public restroom. SMDH. Our waitress barely did her job. I did like the fact that they take your cell number and text you when your table is ready. So overall I'm on the fence, good food, poor service."}
{"text":"Our burger?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Extremely over priced.  The burgers were ok.  The fries over cooked and soaked in salt.  Made a 30 minute walk in 100 degree heat to be sad by their food."}
{"text":"I live very close to Wahlburgers and my review is based on going (1) when they first opened and it was really busy (2) recently on a Saturday to give it a second try. Both times, I was not super impressed with their burgers. 

Pros: 
- The staff is very nice and always friendly
- Tater Tots are not bad but you can always buy your own bag of McCains
- The services is relatively quick (you can be in and out in an hour)

Cons
- The burgers are very greasy (I know, burgers are not suppose to be super healthy, but doesn't mean the buns are gleaming with grease) 
- The burgers are put together very haphazardly. I had the original burger and turkey thanksgiving burger. Both times, I need a billion napkins, which they graciously give, to clean up the sauce that is oozing out the burger. I get the need to have sauce on a burger, but not to the point where it is coming out from all sides of the bun and making your bun soggy. 
- The burgers just don't match up to some of the great burger joints in Toronto like Burger Priests, Parts and Labour or even franchises like Milestones or Jack Astors. 
- The wait times to get a spot. I got it when they first opened, but as I seen in the reviews below, no matter what time or day, even if the restaurant is not at full capacity, you will have to wait while their staff cleans the tables. It seems they have a very inefficient way of running things, they don't have a bus boy/girl cleaning up the mess. The hostess is often running around spraying tables, cleaning up messes and setting up tables. Often, you see a table where the servers have clearly used as a dumping ground for unclean glasses.  This turns me off, but what really sets a bad taste in my mouth when there are CLEAN TABLES AVAILABLE FOR SEATING, but your servers are slow in setting the table!  So, Mark, why am I waiting to be seated when you have tables for seating?

Overall, Toronto is a mecca for great dining. Wahlburgers just isn't able to compete with the creativity that Toronto Chefs have in concocting interesting burgers/sandwiches that would lure Torontonians to keep coming back to this mediocre burger joint."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, Wahlburgers have tasty burgers, but they were costly and miniscule. For that price, I predicted their burgers to be two inches thick and stuffed with cheese. That would be ideal if I didn't go in with high expectations."}
{"text":"Don't bother with breakfast here. Small portions of completely generic breakfast staples are marked up to insane prices. I know we're in an airport, but $18 (including tax/tip) for a two-egg breakfast is madness. At least the service is painfully slow, even when the restaurant is less than 1/4 full..."}
{"text":"I don't really write reviews, but my Walburgers Las Vegas dining experience was definitely deserving of some high praise. It was my first time in Vegas and on a whim we decided to check out Walburgers. The food was good and the atmosphere was cool, but the Outstanding thing was the Service. Miguel really made us feel welcomed and he really went above and beyond. Everyone in the food service industry should stop in to Walburgers Vegas and take notes from Miguel. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers. Good service!

We tried the fries, poutine, tater-tots, my personal fav, chicken strips, fish burger and the bbq bacon burger -It's sooo good and has a kick to it!

I thought it was pricy originally, but then tried Burger's Priest, it was as expensive, the burger wasn't as good and the fries were super greasy!

The manger Alex, came by our table to say hello. She was super friendly!
Would go back, it's  friendly place for some comfort food!"}
{"text":"Always PACKED, luckily we got to jump into free seats at the bar, good food but a bit overpriced for an average cheeseburger"}
{"text":"In love with this place! Prices were good, food was amazing and we were sold when we read \"government cheese\" on the menu! Plus not having to deal with kids is also a plus. Great place to eat and just have a few drinks and relax!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid burger joint when you are craving a classic greasy burger. Stick with the OFD/Our Burgers and skip whatever seasonal or proprietary concoction they're trying to pass off as a burger. Laughable to call it a gourmet burger house as I consider the bymark burger to be barely acceptable and Wahlburger's obviously isn't even remotely in the same league. Hit up Marben or nota bene if you are looking for a real, well-rounded gourmet burger. 

Service - Disinterested and curt counter servers. Take out orders take 15-25 minutes to render (even if you're the only one in line). Shuffle to the side after you order and watch whatever sporting event they are streaming and cheer for the sports ball game. 

Tater tots - hit and miss with their crispiness, often times soggy, laden with grease
Fries - not too greasy, pretty decent, but ask them to go easy on the salt unless you like licking salt blocks and relish next day salt bloat
Onion rings - skip these, comes out a soggy mess 4 out of 5 times

OFD burger - can barely discern the swiss cheese, all their buns are cheap white buns with zero redeeming features, no premium fluffy artisanal sesame studded stuff to be found here. Subsequently they get soggy real fast and falls apart while eating (their housemade tomato jam is super jammy), fat, juicy and greasy patty (8 oz. might look paltry in the box but that thing is a killer), will leave you uncomfortably full afterwards but man those first 2-3 bites are just so darn satisfying
Our burger - just a consistently satisfying burger, again the cheese is barely discernible, the pickles are too thin, the bun is a mushy disgrace but if you are low on iron, this thing will get you right back to where you need to be
BBQ Bacon burger - the jalepeno packs some heat and makes this burger a lot more interesting then it actually is, their choice of bacon doesn't add much to the flavor or texture of the burger, BBQ sauce is awkward and cheap tasting, skip it
Thanksgiving burger - a confused concept but basically tastes exactly as it sounds. Order it if you want a leaner cut of meat (the stuffing is quite good quite) but be prepared to feel strangely empty as you eat this grey-ish and sullen-looking patty and ask yourself how someone's tastebuds could be so immature and misguided that they would be compelled to tack this on as a \"Wahlfave\""}
{"text":"$60 for a meal we could have got at 5 Guys for under $20! Nuff said. Food was nothing short of unspectacular. Service was good."}
{"text":"Order:

  - Double Decker (Cheese and Lettuce)
  - Yukon Gold Fries

Price:

I found this to be quite an expensive meal given the portion for the meal I purchased.  The Yukon Gold Fries I felt were a fair deal however the burger seemed to small to be worth the $10.95 price tag (and that's without bacon).

Size:

I found the size of the Yukon Gold Fries were satisfying however the burger was much too small for my liking.  Everyone has their preferences but if you have a similar appetite, this burger will leave you feeling hungry once finished as it did for me.

Quality:

The quality is something to boast about and somewhat over compensates for the stiff price.  The burger was very juice and you could taste the freshness of the patties based solely on the fact that it melts in your mouth as you chew down. The fries had a certain \"zing\" to it that I found delicious compared to your typical fast food restaurant.

Overall:

I would most likely return to this restaurant.  Despite the steep prices, the burger was actually presented well and the taste complimented it nicely.  Perhaps next time for a bigger burger to satisfy my large appetite!"}
{"text":"Not a place I'll ever dine at again. I think Hardy's has better cheese burgers then this place and I don't like Hardy's."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the service, junior went above and beyond when we showed up late for some drinks and appetizers. Fernanda hooked us up with an adult milkshake. The food was amazing didn't expect it to be that good, we had to go there twice in one day!!!  Over all great place for food, drinks, and experience."}
{"text":"Didnt like how they cooked the turkey burger it made me sick after but the restaurant is clean and staff is very nice. Wouldnt come back to try this one but would try other walburgers like the one in Boston MA there food is great they're."}
{"text":"There is absolutely no value in eating here.  Where ever they can they cut corners and charge too much.
Lets start with the fries for $3.50 you would expect a full container but instead they serve you a half full cup of fries.  Potatoes are the cheapest thing you can serve...why do they feel it necessary to skimp so much?
Next the burger.  Decent size but not large by any ones standards.  Really no flavour to it.  I had bacon and cheese on mine and I think there was only once piece of bacon and not a lot of cheese.  For some reason they butter the bun so it is unnecessarily greasy which is too bad because its actually a decent bun.  I spend about $20 on a burger, fries and fountain drink and left disappointed with the food.  If you are going to charge $10 for a burger you better make it a lot better than that.
In general the place is clean and there are lots of places to seat.
I will not go again."}
{"text":"The bbq bacon burger was great but the onion rings not great that is taste and presentation. I was given a replacement order of sweet potato tots which I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"An update to my previous negative review....management of Walburgers invited us back and this time our experience was extremely positive. Josh, our friendly waiter, was terrific and took our drink order immediately and our food order was correct, good, and hot. Josh really was hussling and checked back on a regular basis despite the crowd. Clearly changes have been made within a couple of months to improve their business, service, and staff. The patio is really nice; recommend going there and sitting outside; consider trying the Jenn's chicken sandwich. Thank you Walburgers!"}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome! Highly recommended! They are pricy but this is no fast food burger. Service was a bit slow but was still worth coming to for a great and tasty burger. Suggest not to get the onion rings, which are really onion straws. Stick with the fries."}
{"text":"Wahlburgers is great ! Awesome location filled with very friendly staff , Our server Lewis was very attentive to our needs and made sure our orders were perfect . I recommend the beast excellent tasting burger ! 

Thank you Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Great burgers and food for a great price. Definitely worth the hype!"}
{"text":"Mom's sloppy joe was good but barely any sloppy joe on it. Slight amount of meat and mostly covered with onion straws. Also, the Wahl sauce is just like every other \"special sauce\" eg thousand island. (In and Out, MCD's)."}
{"text":"Found a couple seats at the bar as soon as my friend and I walked up around 8pm on a Saturday. The bar staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious. I got 'The Our Burger' cooked medium and tots. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Terrible.

Small portions.  
Cold food.
Overcooked meat.  

I don't get this place at all.  I have no idea what theme they are going for."}
{"text":"Waste of time.  Lots of hype.  I love a good over priced burger.  And I got a dried over priced burger.   My burger had a fried egg on it.   Omg.  The egg was dry.  I sent it back.  Still dry.  They are not that good.  My daughter  ordered a hotdog.  She needed to kill it in ketchup to eat it.  The fries are really good the fries get a 4 star the restaurant  gets a 2.  You are better off ordering the takeout and eating upstairs."}
{"text":"Didn't expect much but service was great and Jen's sandwich was a huge chicken burger that went down really well!!"}
{"text":"On our way to the Blue Jays game my friend Bobby and I decided we would make my wife jealous and hit up Wahlburgers. It was a great experience that I would recommend to anyone.

They have a nice little restaurant on Blue Jays Way near the Rogers Center. It has a nice design with an eat in area in the front and take out at the back near the kitchens. They also have a small balcony area for take out people to eat if there is room. We didn't want to wait for a table so we headed to the back for takeout.

I ordered the Double Decker and Fries while Bobby had the OFD (Originally from Dorcester) and some Tater Tots. We both really enjoyed our food. Everything was really fresh and tasted great. Next time I think I will get the triple because I was still a little hungry but that's my fault for not getting enough.

We were lucky enough to score a table upstairs to eat so we hung out, ate and watched the Jays fans make their way to the game. I will definitly be eating here next time I go to a game."}
{"text":"I like the TV show; so I was willing to check the place out. This place is so over priced for a McDonald's burger. The bathrooms smelt and were dirty. The upstairs garbage was full and the employees just kept walking by it. Also, when I was walking up the stairs to find a restroom I was cut off by two employees. The only good thing about this place was my server who I gave an extra $20 to and she brought it back. That's the only reason I'm giving it a 2 star not a 1."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the show and of the family.
But not a fan of the overpricing. The shoestring onion rings were so salty they weren't even edible. 
The bun was good but nothing else was good enough for the prices or the wait. Also the sweet tots were under cooked. 
Very disappointing cause I wanted to LOVE it.  :(

Still a fan, just not one of the restaurant."}
{"text":"A regular burger is simple, yet difficult to get right. I love their 'Our' burger - amazing bun and overall great taste. I went there almost every day during my trip! I've been on a quest since then to find an equal/better burger, but I just haven't found it, yet. They really need to open up more than one location in Canada."}
{"text":"This is a great place, expect to pay strip prices.. but great burger, great staff and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Long wait time and so-so food. Would not recommend. Was expecting much better. Oh well, gave it a try."}
{"text":"Ive never had so much fun in my life! We stopped by wahlburgers last night and got drinks from the bar. Brittany and jones were absolutley amazing. The music was bumpin the vibe was fun we danced and had such a great time. The most down to earth people weve met in vegas so far. We have a few days left and plan on going back to see them for more drinks for my bachlorette party. Thanks yall for showing us a good time!"}
{"text":"I only had a problem with the price. 

Service was good, Aria was our bartender and she was verrry pleasent and great. Food tasted good but we believe it was a little too expensive for what you get. My burger was $11 and it was about the size of a Whopper Jr. It is a la carte so you still have to buy a side of fries."}
{"text":"Waited almost an hour for a burger not worth the wait. I ordered \"The Melt\" it's a grilled cheese with a meat patty in the middle. I've never had a grilled cheese that I didn't love and unfortunately I only remember how bad it was. It was very dry!!"}
{"text":"We went to Wahlburgers for dinner.  They asked how we wanted the burgers cooked and we said medium (which they also recommended).  They burgers came out well done!  The sweet Potato Tots were good.  Nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"I love coming here after work on the strip! Courtney, the bartender, is super cool and always friendly! Great people. Great food. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We started by waiting 30-40 mins to be seated, not bad. Then, after we were seated, we waited another 20 minutes to be able to flag down a server. She said that because we ordered drinks from the bar, they assumed we were served (which of course, has never happened at any other establishment we have been to). After i was able to flag someone down, she said it would be another hour before we even saw our food. So we left. Never even got to try the food. Sad, because the chain in the Northeast is not bad."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came to whalburgers
After the autoshow and we were starving. The service was let's say...mediocre and the wait for take out was verrrry long (maybe because of hunger?) we ordered two double deckers,two fries,onion rings, Alma's Mac and one drink as they don't do combos. Well that all came to.....$44.52! Very expensive, however we really enjoyed the burgers. the fries were ok and the onion straws or strings? Well those are ok too. It's definitely not worth going out of your way for but still is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Tried Wahlburgers today for the first time. Overall I think it was great. Tasty food, good atmosphere, prices are what I'd expect....mostly (see my comments on drink prices below). 

I ordered the Our Burger, Sweet Potato Tots, and Iced Tea. Total was $17 something.  Other reviewers have complained about the automatic 18% gratuity which did make me pause. But you can skip that and head to the back take out counter and order from there where no gratuity is added. They have a decent sized section of tables near the counter reserved for people who order from take out (same food menu).  So basically if you don't want table service just head to the back and you should have no problem grabbing a table after getting your food (no automatic gratuity). 

The burger was a bit smaller than other burger places (I ordered the single Our Burger not the double or triple) but with that and the sweet potato tots it was definitely a full meal. Burger was very tasty. Comes with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, cheese, and their special wahlsauce. I'd certainly order that again. You can add additional toppings for extra cost (think caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, crispy bacon, white cheddar, blue cheese, onion rings, avocado). 

Sweet potato tots were good.....probably a good complement to their Thanksgiving Burger.  The side order was quite large. 

My friend ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger with Tater Tots and Alma's Macaroni. She loved the meal.....raved about the burger! I tasted the macaroni salad and can say it was quite good...fresh tasting. 

On my next trip I plan to try the Wahlbrewski (locally brewed IPA.... I've read it's a special brew from Mill Street). It goes for $7 /pint. Oddly their bottled beers seem over priced (bottle of Corona for $8?) I can only assume they're strategically priced to push the Wahlbrewski....

For a soft opening their staff was well prepared. Word is official grand opening is Nov 15 which may include an actual Wahlberg brother or two. 

I'll definitely return to try more of the burger menu."}
{"text":"For a burger joint, I would expect the burger to be the highlight of the meal. However the Bbq bacon burger was served with a cold and soggy bun. Beef patty was dry. Burger was a bit overpriced $12. Instead the highlight of my meal was the sweet potato tater tots that were very good, surprisingly. Service was good."}
{"text":"I went their with my girlfriend and we totally enjoyed the food.  The burgers are a little bit on the spendy side but they had a great flavor and the tots were good.  I'd say in the grand scheme of the burger world, they are better than 5 guys but still don't de-throne In-n-Out."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the prices were great however our waiter, Ross, blew us away. The best service we've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"As a local, I drove down and parked in the Paris parking deck. I was pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant close to the Bally's casino just beside the Starbucks in the Grand Bazzaar shops. I had driven past before on Las Vegas Blvd, however, what I saw was their kiosk out front. We were greeted immediately by a super friendly host who directed us to the bar for quick seating. (Secret for anyone reading, I always sit at the bar lol) Our bartenders, Michaela and Basil were also friendly and took our order right away. We ordered the Our burger, the bbq bacon burger and tator tots. We also had a strawberry mule and a pint of Guinness. Everything we had was amazing. Our drinks were prompt, our food came out quickly and the service was superb. The bar manager, Paul, stopped by to check on us and really made us feel at home. I loved the way the fresh jalapeños gave the bbq bacon burger a zing. Our tator tots were perfectly crisp and the our burger I should have taken a picture of because I would love to try and recreate that at home. The atmosphere was electric. Great buzz about the place. Constant traffic of people in and out. This is a great addition to the area. Really raises the bar for Bally's and the Grand Bazaar shops. We will certainly be back. There are so many items I want to try. Beyond the great food and service, I see some very exciting shakes and cocktails that I look forward to giving a shot on my next visit. Check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening with my family with 2 small kiddies. The space easily accommodated us and our stroller. Ambience and staff were easy going.

We ordered the \"our burger\", the Dorchester, sweet tots and onion rings. We loved the \"our burger\" and ended up ordering another round of the our burger. (Definitely could easily eat 2 burgers). The first \"our burger\" was cooked medium to medium well on some areas, which OK considering it was stated on the menu that, that's how it's cooked. However I would of liked it if it were either consistently medium or consistently medium well... Not just different areas! Also the onion rings (as stated on the menu)... Umm I expected rings not shreds of deep fried onion. Wasn't sure how to eat it... Went from eating few shreds of a time by hand to using a fork, which wasn't very effective. Beware of the \"onion rings\". The sweet tots were ok. Overall, the \"our burger\" stood out the most.

It took quite a longer time than the usual fast paced burger joints to get our burgers served. However the staff were friendly. 

It's a good place to hang with friends and watch a game and good enough to bring your family."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch today.  I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and side of tater tots.  My husband had the turkey burger.  Excellent food!  The grilled cheese was loaded with bacon!  And my husband couldn't believe how good the turkey burger was!  Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Got the mac-n-cheese and added pulled pork. Mac was bland and al dente and came in the size of a small cup. Pulled pork was tasty but came in the size of a salsa container from a mexican restaurant. Cost $13."}
{"text":"Great service, checked in and the wait was 25 mins. The app they use let us know how many parties in front of us and how much time left. Our waitress was nice and courteous. My BBQ bacon burger was great and loved the tater tots! I would recommend to anyone in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The quality was the worst, food was cold and you pay a premium price because it's on the strip. Go to 5 guys and get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Breakfast is NOT good at all. Sausage and tots were very oily and of a cheap quality. Eggs did not came as we ordered. Coffee was $4 and it was very weak. On the bright side, service was fast and friendly. I will came back to try the burger one of these days."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this burgers what with all the fan fare from the related television program. The plating was well done. The restaurant looked great but the burgers didn't have a memorable taste, the fries were good however."}
{"text":"First time eating here, and it might be because of the airport, but it wasn't all that I expected it to be.
I got the melt and a side of mac salad. The taste of the burger was great, amazing flavor, but the bread was super greasy. Then the mac salad was dry and flavorless. Even the coke they brought me tasted bad!
Guess you can't believe everything you see on TV."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give it 5 stars just because Fernanda and Amanda were adorable and gave us such great service. I ordered a chicken salad and my husband order the classic house burger. Even though our food was taking a very long time (they weren't very busy but the girls explained that they had only been open a short time and were trying their best). We didn't mind the wait because we were having so much fun with the girls. I eventually received my salad and our sides (which were not hot, though Amanda replaced them right away) but my husband still did not have his cheeseburger. The girls assured us it would be out right away. After 10 minutes and those poor girls getting yelled at by the people behind the counter, the cheeseburger arrived. When it arrived it was a complete mess and looked like it had been in a martini shaker and poured on a plate. The girls apologized profusely and kindly took 20 percent off of our meal for our trouble. The salad and cheeseburger were actually tasty, but the whole experience with the food made us not want to return unless it was for drinks only with the very friendly wait staff the restaurant seemed to have. We will be traveling the states this month and are hoping to try another Wahlburgers that is maybe more seasoned when it comes to the food."}
{"text":"I had to go to Wahlburgers when I arrived in Vegas. The location was cool and it was crowded but no wait. I ordered Donnie's favorite, The BBQ bacon using a turkey patty and it was delicious. Everything I excepted. I'll be back in 2 months when I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Wahlburgers delicious tasting burgers. I recommend the Double Decker with sweet potato tots. Love you Patty you rock!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Markey Marks place 

Burgers are okay, nothing special.  However, Mac and Cheese with smoked bacon and thin crispy onion rings are phenomenal.  I'd come back just for the sides"}
{"text":"On vacation from the east coast and happened to stumble in here.  My family and I were thrilled when we did. We love the show and had high expectations.  I had the Thanksgiving day sandwich, apparently it's Marky Marks favorite.  The burger was excellent and everything I wanted it to be!Our waiter Ross was very attentive, fast to bring us everything, and great with suggestions.  The best service I received on my entire vacation.  I highly recommend wahlburgers and ask for Ross!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place. It's my new go to for drinks and great food. Victor was my bartender. He was on top of it. Best service I've had in Vegas by far!!!!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! Not even a decent restroom. Waitresses aren't charismatic and the whole staff is always looking bad. High prices, low service, ugly food."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and love burgers on the grill taste, so I ordered a cheese burger with onion rings. The service was slow had to several times ask who was waiter  but it was busy , then waiter showed up friendly and took our order. Our order arrived and I took a bite and it was like biting into a crisco lard sandwich. I like some grease on my burger like the next guy but the grease was just to much. Then on to the onion rings, if that's what you want to call them,  they are more like broken tree branches fried in oil. The waiter brought the check and noticed I didn't eat the food and offered to talk to the manager, who didn't charge me, and that's what the rating is for as they were great about it but the chef wasted the other 3 part of my star rating."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out. Excellent burgers! Onion rings were great too! Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Had a club house turkey burger. It was pretty decent. Good enough for a quick lunch. Nice sporty vibe. The waiter was very accommodating too. Finished my food before taking a photo."}
{"text":"I was walking the strip and was hungry so decided to stop at Wahlburgers to have a m and also a drink so sat at the bar. Rodrigo is the bartender who greeted me and was amazing the entire time. Great customer service. I ordered the Portobello sandwich and it was delicious. Will stop by again"}
{"text":"Ok but Overrated.  I've had much better burgers before.  Solid but nothing memorable.   Pretty bland overall."}
{"text":"Been here for over an hour, still don't have food. We asked to order and frankly literally waved our hands for a while before we were even served.  A table that came in after we ordered just received their food. We asked about it and we were told our order likely never processed. Would have been nice to know that when they found out...offering us 25% discount.  Not enough for the horrible service.  Pains me to say this as I love this place and their food but this isn't acceptable."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened up. I've stopped to get the triple deck burger here both times I've come to Vegas in the past year. This past time it was super crowded, but we were able to find seats at the bar. Courtney took care of us. She was super attentive but not overbearing. Both the food and service was 5 star"}
{"text":"Wahlburgers is fine for a fast food burger; but it's nothing special. If you're really in search of an amazing burger, however, there are infinitely better places to go in the city."}
{"text":"Total morons work at this place! Hostesses and the one male host are terrible. They have no clue what they are doing and haven't been trained properly. I wanted to try this place but because of their rudeness  left!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, disappointing food. Very greasy onion shredded \"rings\". Wife had Jenn's chicken sandwich which she did not like. I had the BFD which was not very good as well. Won't be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has a lively atmosphere with friendly staff/quick service, and good food... it's pricey for such a small burger (& no fries incld.), however. It's the sort of place people generally go for the experience (celeb/t.v. show connection...), in my opinion, and ours was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Loud, noisy inside.  Burgers delivered to wrong table, took way too long, and were cold!  They were also missing the bacon we asked for.. geez.  Above all else they were meh even if they arrived on time and warm.  On plus side wait staff was friendly and apoligetic.  Skip the hype, go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I looked up wahlburgers on yelp to see if they do takeout orders, and of course it said yes. So i called to confirm and yes again. We wanted takeout to take back to our room at Ballys cause it was too hot out. 
Once we got got there i informed the employee that we wanted to order takeout and he came back very rude and said we dont take out i explained to him that i had just called and they confirmed that they do. 
We were very unhappy about this cause we are huge fans of the show and did not get treated well. 
I even DM the Wahlbergs on instagram about this."}
{"text":"Awesome! I had the BBQ bacon burger and fries. The quality of the food didn't suffer at all from being an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Good burger. Cold fries. Slow service.  Had to go because Mark Wahlburg!  Yea no bathrooms inside, no appetizers.  Not bad prices though for the strip."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!! At around 6pm on Saturday night the wait was only about 20 minutes. They get your phone number and text you when your table is ready. My husband & I both had the Our Burger and my sister had Dads Basic Burgers all of which were cooked perfectly! I strongly recommend the Mac N' Cheese with Smoked Bacon. SO GOOD!! Our server (I wish I could remember his name) was great. 3 burgers, 2 sides of fries, 1 side of tots and the mac n cheese all for about $60. Not too bad. I'm a local so I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited that they opened a walburger in Vegas I had to try their burger my babe wanted to go to Bobby fay I said no let go to walburger the place was nice music not to loud the food omg the burger I was not impressed the Mac and cheese was watery and the fries cold I wish I went to Bobby flay ......"}
{"text":"Watch out, IN and OUT!! These burgers are AH-mazing! We stopped in while walking the strip in Vegas and were so pleasantly surprised! Everyone from the host at the door, to our server were very friendly and concerned that we were getting everything we needed. Clean, clean, clean! It was VERY busy during lunch time, but our wait was less that 15 minutes. We both got the classic double and added our own little twists (jalapenos/bacon). Our server was Lauren and was on point! Very pretty with a beautiful smile.  We came back the same afternoon, after the ferris wheel for milkshakes. We were lucky enough to get Lauren again. We ordered milkshakes and a rootbeer float. We also decided to splurge and split a 'Fluffanuttah' grilled sandwich (peanutbutter, bananas, nutella, fluff, grilled) YUM!  All of the prices are comparable to the strip. We were shocked at how great the meat was! The manager even came over to speak with us about our experience. Make it a point to stop in here. You won't be disappointed! Ask for Lauren."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, great service and fun atmosphere. Had the OFD and loved it.  Onion strings were so yummy.  This will be a stop for me every time I am in Vegas.  Wish you would open one in Seattle."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!!  It's a burger place and the burgers were just not good.  I believe it is related to poor cooking rather than poor quality.  Burger patty could've been used as a hockey puck.  Adult frappes were great.  Tater tots were just what you would expect.  Onion strings were not good.  The service here was exceptional.  Our server did a great job and was very attentive.  My fiancé says \"I love you Donnie\""}
{"text":"Food was good but for the price u pay compared to portion size and quality of service, it's not worth it. I was excited about trying it but I probably won't go back unless someone I know wanted to go for the novelty of it all."}
{"text":"Fair service,burgers are raw,management unprofessional, they tried to charge me for burgers I did not eat!!!! Corporate never responded to my e mail!!!Bad Business!!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Have been waiting to try this place for a long time.  I watch the show and I love the Wallburg family.  However the service was terrible.  I waited for 45 min for a burger and fries.  When it came my fries were cold and my burger was dripping grease. 
No one checked on me about my meal. In fact they left my bill/ chequer when I ordered."}
{"text":"Burgers were dry, not juicy at all.  Love tater tots, so no complaint there.  Their \"Onion Rings\" are not onion rings at all but onion straws that you see garished often on steaks so definitely not I was expecting and not good as a side.  Agree with people commenting on the decor, it's definitely a weird fusion of sit down and fast food.  Bright white and green decor screams freshii, not a gourmet burger joint.  Bar looks good, lots of selection but again, fits in weirdly with the rest of the decor."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby and some friends, wanted to try it out since we are such huge mark Wahlburg fans. My burger, the our burger was very dry, but the sauce was good. I ordered the mud pie but it was grey not chocolate in color and did not taste like chocolate at all although clearly on their tvs in the restaurant it is chocolate colored. Def not worth 15$. 1 star for the sauce and 1 star for tater tots. Burger priest is much better than this place."}
{"text":"After waiting for 25 minutes,  we walked out.  The waitress walked by is at least 10 times and never acknowledged that we were there.  Told the host and he reminded her she had another table and still did not wait on us.  Went to Johnny Rockets and had Awesome burgers, Awesome service and much cheaper!!!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Portions small. Burgers lackluster. Atmosphere touristy. Just build the price of fries into the meal cost. Nobody wants to pay $12 for a sub-par burger and then have to pitch an extra $3.00 for a meager side of fries.

Was curious to see what the fuss was about. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"If you are from the Boston area or know anything about the Bostonian favorite foods - you need to try this place. We got a table in 15 minutes! Pretty good for New Years weekend in Vegas. Eric was an awesome server and suggested his favorites menu option and pointed out Donnie's and Mark's favorites. You'll feel like part of the Wahlberg family. The Walh-sauce was awesome one the tarot tots. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This is not easy because I wanted to like this restaurant. I like their show, and thought their food would be outstanding.  Unfortunately, I was left underwhelmed.

First of all, it was 45 min to be seated, then another 10 min to get our order taken, and another 25 min to get our food. All totaled, 80 min before I took my first bite.

As for the food, we ordered the Thanksgiving Sandwich, \"Our Burger\", and Onion Strings.  The Thanksgiving was very dry, and I'm sure this was due to the ground turkey patty.  Not even the cranberry sauce inside helped with how dry it was.  \"Our Burger\" wasn't bad, but it tasted like something anyone could make at home.  At nearly $12, it should be more exceptional.  The Onion Strings were undercooked.  Lastly, though minor, there was no ice in my soda.  I didn't really get a chance to ask the young man as he seemed very rushed and busy.  

In the end, I can now say I tried Wahlburgers.  I will only go back if I am ever in Boston, as I would like to try the food at the original restaurant.  As for the Las Vegas location, there are way too many other choices I'd make before I dined there again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to check out Wahlburgers hoping to find another great burger joint near home.  We ordered the bbq bacon burger and the double decker w/bacon  along with 2 sides, tater tots & onion rings for take out. We anticipated the wait, took 30 minutes, and was hopefull it would have been worth it. When we brought the food home we were disappointed to find out our order was wrong....no bacon on the double decker. The burgers were decent but definately had better but the sides were good.  I'm not sure if i would go back to wait 30 minutes and to have them screw up my order.   Btw, don't drive there....took 25 min to find parking."}
{"text":"We were excited to try out this place. We were seated pretty quickly with prompt service. My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the mushroom sandwich. I have to say my sandwich was overly oily and it over powered any other taste. My husband enjoyed his burger and it wasn't nearly as oily as mine. When you order make sure to say light oil."}
{"text":"Best burger in Toronto? Indeed 1 of the best for sure. Excellent quality and amazing taste. Highly recommended! We ordered the \"Our Burger\" with sweet potato tots and golden tots. The service was great and the atmosphere was very welcoming. The food was incredibly delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed everything. I recommend this place for all burger lovers."}
{"text":"After all the hype about this restaurant and based on its location in the SOHO Hotel one would expect this burger joint would be something exciting to experience, well it is not! Instead this place was one of the most disappointing places I have ordered food from. We placed a phone in order and went to pick it up for 4 adults and two children. The person who picked it up asked if the staff could double check the order  to make sure the order was complete. Well many things were missing. This was one person returning to our room with many bags. They could packed the numerous bags in one larger one making it easier to carry but they did not. They missed out on all the condiments and I mean all. Not even a napkin was offered. On the menu it states all their burgers are topped with dill pickles, cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. Well ours came with none of these things. The meat was too salty. The food was given to us cold. The tater tots are pictured with dipping sauces which were not offered. There were no lids on the tater tots allowing them to get cold quickly on the walk from the restaurant through the hotel back to our room. The grilled cheese sandwiches ordered came as one grilled cheese. We had two kids to feed. The only thing decent was the Macaroni salad.
When you are paying $10.00 for a hamburger or more you expect more than your average burger. We were all very disappointed in the food and service. We will not be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"Many options in Las Vegas for celebrity restaurants and went with Wahlbergers because I like thier show; however does not translate to a great restaurant. The servers were a little rushed and not friendly. Got the BBQ burger and came with no BBQ, when I tracked down a different server she basically asked what I wanted, like who cared... Food was ok, over priced for burgers and everyone agreed everything was just ok!"}
{"text":"I went to Wahlburger's on a Friday during what I believe would be dinner rush time and received fabulous service. The hostess was welcoming and the bartender (who was my server) was very accommodating and friendly. The \"our burger\" was hands down one of the best burgers I have had! 
This place is a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh, this place is just okay. Honestly I did enjoy their burgers and their fries and I'm a huge burger fry guy but for the price that you're has to pay there really isn't much to this place it's basically a McDonald's with Mark Wahlberg photos hanging over the walls. There's also a dining room area where you can have a waiter serve you these McDonald's like burgers. Which to be honest just seems really weird. 
I'm not sure if while burgers is a burger joint or a restaurant it has fast food quality food and fast food atmosphere with waiters, a bar, and price from a expensive restaurant.
The Thanksgiving burgers pretty good and deafly worth a try but I wouldn't think to go here on my own accord. Though somebody else were to mention going here I would have a problem with it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been wanting to eat a Wahlburger since the premiere of their show, he's a big fan of the Wahlburgs so of coarse we came out to vegas for his birthday and saw their beautiful building piercing on the strip and had to go! We're from the Los Angeles area and are aware there is one opening up on sunset and are really looking forward to dining there as well. But Las Vegas location set the bar high. Great service, we absolutely loved our waiter, the burger fries and onion rings were beyond delicious. Everything cooked perfectly. Awesome place we are looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"The burger was good but small, price for the burger seems to high since you can get a bigger burger in other good joints for a similar price. The house sauce and the homemade ketchup didn't provide much difference in flavor. The restaurant had a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try a Wahlburgers.  So disappointed :).  Waited a while for the server to come to our table.  Asked question about the menu and she just shrugged her shoulders and pointed to the menu. Food turned cold on us and server never came back to ask if we needed anything."}
{"text":"All I wanted to do was enjoy a beer and some apps with 3 friends on the patio to enjoy the beautiful Friday night. Nope was told 15-20 minute wait.  Ok I will get a beer at the bar and wait.  Nope, can only go to the bar if there are seats open at the bar. Ok there are 4 seats.  Nope.  Look at the picture, looks like a lot of open seats."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night put our name on the wait list and was told it would be 30 minutes and they would call us when our table is ready. We waited at public Square for 40 minutes before going back to check up on our table. Once we walked in the host claims she called us but we never recieved any type of phone call. We get seated and ordered and it took 45 minutes from when we ordered to receive our food and when our food comes out they definitely only brought out 1 fry. Food was okay our patties came out a little red. Definitely would not be going here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"As I read the heartwarming tale of the Wahlburg's growing up in Dorchester sitting around the table enjoying food, family, love, I snapped back into my reality of eating mediocre food and hemorrhaging $62 for a salad, tots, and two burgers. The market is saturated with burger joints so there are way better options out there."}
{"text":"Visited on 1/15/17 service was good ..burgers were tasty and juicy..the fries unfortunately were over cooked which seems to be the industry standard these days...the reason for the 3 stars comes with the pricing 2 burgers 2 fries 2 cokes and tip should never be $58 even on the Las Vegas strip...there was nothing special about Wahlburgers overall. Sadly this was a 1 and done its pricing simply can not be overlooked"}
{"text":"heard about place for a while, was a little anti climatic

the burgers are dinky but good quality. got the turkey burger which was really good. could easily eat 2 of them. 

good to try out for first time but would prefer alot of other burger places. 

price is $$$ for what u get."}
{"text":"The burger was amazing. We were not hungry but really wanted to try one and split one. It was so good we bought a second. The service was slow but it's only its third day open so I am not surprised, they are obviously still learning. The staff was very friendly though. Will definitely come back my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Just ate here with this afternoon at the Soho location.  

PROS:
This is a very good central Downtown Toronto location, can't beat the spot on Blue Jays Way.
Decent service noted considering the typical busy lunch period on a Saturday and especially for a long weekend.  Waited approx. 10 minutes for my order so not bad. 
Main level seating area was fairly clean.  

CONS: 
I tried the OFD burger for myself and can honestly say that I have had much better.  I also understand the higher price for the central downtown / hotel location but this burger was bland (meat had no seasoning at all) and also way to much oil overall, which turned the potential brioche-style bun into a soggy disaster.  The tomato jam was more like regular tomato sauce, quite disappointing.  My friend tried The Melt, also way to much oil and wrong choice of bread used in my opinion (regular white toast), which crumbled apart because of all the wet ingredients - could have been better with a thicker bun. So $30.00 for 2 burgers and one drink, was not worth it at all.  
Decided to sit at the upper level since the main level was quite full, big mistake (should have taken our food to go) because the tables were not wiped down, lots of napkins and garbage on the floor & messy condiment area.........some fast food joints out there do a much better job with the cleanliness and upkeep.  Although the upper level is a more casual seating area, it should not be overlooked.

I'm rating this place 2 stars based on the quality of food vs overall price, and the lack of cleanliness.   There are better burger places in the city that are worth the price."}
{"text":"Decent burger. Fries are ok. Didn't blow me away in Hingham didn't blow me away in CLE. Good location though if looking for something on the way to a game."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with friends and family in Vegas. Visited on a Monday night, pretty crowded but still got a seat quickly. Burgers great, tots awesome, and so was the mac n cheese. All staff helpful and friendly, will eat again next visit to Vegas"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations considering burger places are the new rage in the restaurant industry. I had the dad burger which only has the special sauce, pickles, and onions. While my burger was juicy my pickles were missing and there was barely any sauce on my bun. I went with 3 other people who enjoyed their meals, but we were never given silverware or offered refills on our drinks. The fries were super salty and the onion strings needed a dipping sauce. Overall, our meal was just ok. Nothing special about any of it. I was super excited to get the fluffanutta as dessert. To my surprise, it barely had fluff and was soaked in butter. It tasted greasy and smelled like burnt toast. I was highly disappointed with it. Service and food were all mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Went here on Tuesday for dinner, was seated immediately. I would think that when I am paying $13 for a double burger (2, 3 ounce patties) that it would include a side with it. Well I was wrong, you have pay extra if you want fries. I ended up going for the Macaroni & Cheese with bacon, that is an additional $8. The best part was the bacon. The cheese sauce was watery and lacked flavor and left the pasta dry. Cheese is supposed to be creamy and should stick to the pasta. To get the cheese I had to drink it out of the cup. I do not think I will go back, $32 for a burger, macaroni and a beer."}
{"text":"Arrived mid-way through lunch, got a table with some friends. Enjoyed a tasty burger and some sides. The service was great. I enjoyed my sweet potato tater tots and my friends had onion rings. The onion rings are more like something I would put on a burger instead of a side. Tasty food, clean space and great service = excellent lunch."}
{"text":"The fries were nice but the burger patty was small and I had to find it in between the buns. Cute, but not what a carnivore seeks. A quick bite, yes. 

The setup is slightly confusing in that the takeout is in the back of the restaurant. 

Didn't click until I saw all the references to Mark Wahlberg to realize the wordplay with the restaurant name."}
{"text":"The show is great.   The restaurant is a different story.  First of all there is only one way in and out, very awkward because they take your cell phone number to page you when a table is available.  There isn't anywhere to sit while you wait outside and the area outside the restaurant is smoky, noisy and full of drunks.  The food:   Ehh. I've had much better burgers for way less expensive.  It was so loud in the restaurant: music playing outside, music playing inside, drunk idiots yelling and screaming.  I had to yell my order to the waiter.  My family was not able to talk to each other without yelling because it was so loud in the restaurant.  No drink refills or offer to refill.  The burgers were so so.  3 burgers, 3 soft drinks, an order of tater tots and an order of fries.  $65.00.   Sorry Mark, Paul, Donnie and Elma,  love your show, but won't be going back to Wahlburgers again.  Too bad, we were really looking forward to it also.  Bottom line: disappointing, don't waste your time or money eating here."}
{"text":"I thought it was amazing! The service was super fast and the food was so good! I would go there every week if I had a choice!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Went in because of the name and tv show trying to temper expectations. My expectations were blown away, food, drinks, and sides were amazing. Mac n cheese with bacon was the perfect side to the bbq burger which was cooked to perfection. If you have a waiter named Rob, listen to his suggestions. He won't steer you wrong and he was a blast to have as a waiter. Joked around with me and my family and made the whole experience that much better."}
{"text":"It was amazing little soggy but  really good  service ok gave me free stickers Amazing"}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ burger with fries. Tom the burger to be just okay nothing special. They have plenty of seating and the environment was good. However not terribly excited about going back. If I do go back it will be to try a different burger."}
{"text":"Ran out of corona before the cavs final and service was so slow. Broooo the this place is whack af"}
{"text":"I decided it was time to get a hot decent meal after flying in to Toronto from Budapest, which was about 9 hour flight. I came across Wahlburgers located near terminal 67 while waiting for my connecting flight to Los Angeles. I chose the Crispy Haddock sandwich for $9.95 with regular fries for $3.95. I waited about 20 minutes to get my order. The fries were cold and not seasoned. The sandwich buns were also cold and saggy. The tartar sauce did not even taste like tartar sauce. The fried fish was a large portion and it was not crispy at all. The fish was under seasoned and it smelled very fishy. This was my first and last time to visit this franchise burger place."}
{"text":"Burger Patties were way smaller than the bun. Sweet Potato Tots were half of the cup. The Location by the Stadium is way better!!"}
{"text":"Wahlburgers was alright, but the menu was a bit of a mess. They have burgers at 8 ounces and burgers at 1/3 of a pound. Why on earth can't they stick to one measurement unit? Worse than that, their 1/3 lb burger actually comes in two different patty sizes at two different price points. It's listed on the menu as a 1/3 lb and suddenly you get a choice of how big it is. What? I was so confused by the waitress I just pointed at the menu. 

And it's creepy that they call American cheese, \"government\" cheese. Calling it government cheese makes it sound like it's going to be full of mold, maybe old and rancid, and kind of disgusting. Like it's been stuck in some government warehouse since the 1950s.

Burger was okay, nothing fantastic. Onion rings however, we're out of this world. Thin and lightly battered, with sea salt. Absolutely delicious.

With so many burger places to choose from, I doubt I'll be back. I'm not buying into the brand - I don't buy into any burger brand. I just want good burgers."}
{"text":"Had one of the best burgers in my life at this place. 8oz beef bacon burger sauteed with mushrooms was perfect right till the last bite. I had to slow down when I realized I only had 2-3 bites left and remind myself to savour it haha. The poutine was also a good side and perfect size."}
{"text":"Was delicious, we each got a different burger and no complaints.  Service was awesome. We even switched servers in the middle of our meal and the service remained awesome!!  Food was served hot, beer was cold, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Wahlburgers are not tasty at all, especially at the price they are offering. You're overpaying for that quality of burgers."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Burger was delish!   What a great staff!  Made you feel so welcome; patiently answered my questions; appreciate that!!!"}
{"text":"I had wahlburgers today and to be honest, it was dam good. Wait was 15 minutes and service was great, thanks Victor, yet the price was fair. I'm a burger person and tried one of the best, Ramsay's Burger, and it was a big disappointment because the meat was bland and the fries were stile. If you don't want to wait for hours, pay overprice food, go to wahlburgers. BTW, I'm not paid or smothered to write these experience like those others reviews who are with your essay comment lol and negative reviews. If you expect highend 10 dollar burgers, and complain about it, go to Ramsay's burger."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and service! We loved Victor and our sub server Jaob (main server went on break). Both were personable and on top of it. Amazing recommendations and we all (4 people) had different items and all agreed amazing. Get you're ass in there!"}
{"text":"Awesome variety of gourmet burgers. Got the bacon avocado burger with jalapeños which not only looked picture perfect, but was just as delicious. Got the sweet potato tots which were okay, but the special sauce that came with it was phenomenal. Atmosphere was fun and service was fast. Loved that we got a complimentary picture and that it was non-smoking."}
{"text":"This is a fast food sit down restaurant. Burgers were tasty and fresh. I had mine made into a salad, that was different but a nice change as I try to stay away from bread. Paul's sauce was great as was the sweet potato tots!"}
{"text":"First, you will see by my profile this is the first review I've written on Yelp--in fact, I almost never write reviews but felt that this was such a missed expectation that I needed to write something.  Also, I hope the Wahlberg's are reading these reviews because I like the boys and want them to know how the restaurant is operating. 

The Wahlberg's should be embarrassed to have their name on this place.  My wife and i have watched the reality show, fans of the boys, and were optimistic about Wahlburgers.  We made a 2 1/2 hour trip from Columbus for, among other things, a visit to Wahlburgers.

We started by putting our name in for reservations inside.  The hostess said it would be an hour or more. We needed to run an errand so we put our names in anyway.  Our table was ready in 20 minutes so they didn't estimate very well....but I guess better to be seated too early than too late.  

The kitchen was oddly positioned facing the patrons and in the walk way of the patrons.  The waiters were constantly jockeying for position with patrons trying to get to the back patio or their seats---it was an awkward set up.  We were seated very close to the kitchen and the waiters station.  

Because of our seating, we witnessed complete chaos at the waiters station.  The waitresses and waiters seemed listless and milling around the wait station with little urgency.  The kitchen and wait staff were constantly shuffling orders back and forth back to the kitchen because they couldn't keep track of what order was what and they were getting them wrong and confused.  I saw a woman come in from the patio to complain to the manager (or a senior looking person in a golf shirt) and he didn't seem very sympathetic or apologetic.  I saw her pointing, waiving, and getting agitated and he just looked at her....the most he could muster was \"I'm sorry\" and she stormed away.

It took us (and the couple behind us) almost an hour (58 minutes to be exact) to get our food--2 burgers and an order of fries.  The couple that left as we were getting seated said they waited an hour and 45 minutes.  

Our waitress was unapologetic and marginally attentive.  At 50 minutes in to our wait, I walked up to her at the waiter's station to ask how long it might be and she said \"It should be soon\".  When I asked what \"soon\" meant, all she could say is \"I don't know, there are several tickets ahead of you.\"  I was visibly getting frustrated and irritated but she never once offered an acknowledgement, much less an apology attempt to placate me.  In fact, she disappeared for almost 10 minutes and my wife thinks it was to avoid us.

To sum it up:  

--The wait was far too long for just a couple of burgers.
--The service was inattentive, seemingly untrained, and lacked the ability to handle adverse situations.
--The kitchen was chaos and awkwardly located.  It actually increased my anxiety and frustration just to watch them.  They looked completely confused.
--The restaurant was clean but felt more like an amusement park cafeteria than a themed burger restaurant
--If this was a hole in the wall cafeteria, I would still be frustrated but I think I actually found myself a little embarrassed for the Wahlberg's to have their names on the place.  I am sure they all would be appalled at how the place was operating and was perceived.
++The burger and sweet potato tots were pretty good.  Even though it was an hour late, it was fresh, hot and tasted good."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Wahlburgers the other night. She had already been and said it wasn't half bad.. even going on about how good the onion strings are. I went an ordered the Thanksgiving Burger.. sweet potato tots.. and a strawberry frappe. 

The service was friendly but slow. I was particularly creeped out by a guy who kept staring at me, which made me feel really uncomfortable while we waited for our food. When we got our food, we took it to go. Got home only to find the sweet potato tots pretty bland. They barely added any salt, and definitely NO SEASONING whatsoever. The \"frappe\" which is said to be made with ice cream, was very artificially flavoured. The one and ONLY THING I enjoyed was the burger. It was a decent size for me with very juicy ground turkey. The stuffing was amazing with a healthy dollop of squash. The touch of cranberry sauce was perfect at the end. 

With all honesty.. I will go back. But only for the thanksgiving burger!!"}
{"text":"Over priced. Not great service. Came during lunch ordered my $10 burger without a side included. Server asks me how I want my burger cooked.... ok if you are going to ask you had better have the cooks be able to do it. Ordered medium, got well done. Just don't ask and I won't mind! The cook also must have lost the lid to the seasoning shaker because it tasted like eating a handful of black pepper.  No one has come to check on me or even bring my bill. My server has been busy though, busy flirting with another server. Save the shoulder massages for your own time. In 5 more minutes I will be walking out without paying. Can't pay if I don't recieve a bill."}
{"text":"When In Vegas this place is a must. The food is great and the customer service is outstanding. The bartender Rodrigo always helps us out and he's very attentive and sweet. He's quick on his feet and always makes sure we have everything we need. I usually like to get the melt burger, it's delicious. I will continue to go to Wahlburgers for the great customer service and food."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the best bacon avocado cheese burgers I've had so far. Soft/toasted bun, really crisply bacon, amazing. 

What really blew me away was the service. I don't understand how this place has a 3 star rating. Our server was on point! Checked on us often, upgraded our drinks, truly great! Rob and Victor, keep up the amazing work. You deserved every bit of that tip you earned."}
{"text":"My friend and I quite enjoyed our burgers, the Our Burger and BBQ burger were both delicious, well seasoned and appropriately topped.  The bun is exceptional and melts with the burger.  Our opinion was the burger was perfectly sized and of a decent  value.   

I wasn't a huge fan of the thinly sliced onion rings but they were tasty.  Maybe the rings need a do-over with thicker rings  but the portion size is generous.

The gluten free truffle cookie was served warm and a  perfect dose of chocolate. 

It's too bad that the place is getting some negative reviews ... If you read them most agree it's a tasty burger ... Isn't that a good thing.   It's worth a trip.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We ate here while on vacation because my daughter and I have been wanting to try it. Food was excellent and place was clean. Are waiter was fantastic. The food took a while but that is expected for a new place they are still learning and will get better but our waiter kept checking in with us letting us know will be a bit. He took 20% off bill because did take a bit and we did not expect that at all but that is good customer service. Will 100% go back."}
{"text":"Burger was just \"ok\". Service was the most negative, the waiter made us feel stupid by some things he said to us. If you want to hold a conversation with your date, do not go here, the music is really loud! I usually like loud music but not when on a date."}
{"text":"The place is good and I went their with my family in the after noon
We ordered onion rings and some fries
They turned out to be fine 
So I would say so far so good"}
{"text":"I got the ODB burger and it was so, so dry. I don't know how they can get ground beef so dry.... The bun was nice but sucked up all of the ketchup, which left the entire burger so, very dry... And the people at the counter suck. They didn't remain aware of the people waiting to order and they moved rely slow. Maybe that's a Canadian thing. But anyways, their burgers are really, really, really dry."}
{"text":"Amazing! Definitely a place to try! The Sloppy Joe is delicious, tastes homemade and beats the best homemade sloppy joe I've had. The Smores milkshake is unlike any I've ever had, so good and rich. Our server Alexandria was so nice and personable. I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Food Is Delicious, Well Priced. Thank You To Handsome Junior, and amazing accent ! Had wonderful customer service. Had the double decker burger -- huge ! The fries were separate but plenty ! Will definitely come back whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for a couple drinks and apps before seeing a Second City Comedy Show. Our server was sweet, and our food came very fast...no complaints there, but the food was very mediocre and the menu was way too pricey for what you get. Food is served in disposable containers. Honestly i would compare it to an experience I would expect if McDonalds began offering a sit down service- but at a higher price tag. Nothing really truly horrible, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the double burger,  tater tots and a frappe.   Bun for the burger was great but the burger patty size was a joke.   Toppings were fresh,  tater tots are just McCain hash brown bites from any supermarket."}
{"text":"Very unimpressive... I ordered a steam whistle, for $7.50 it came in a pop glass and wasn't close to being a pint.... I got the the regular burger $9.95 with tater tots $3.50, tater tots were okay but bland, the burger was bad, very tiny with more condiments then beef, I had a good quarter of my bun left and no beef, the government cheese was terrible and I like processed cheese. The bartender was nice and gave me their secret sauce, the sauce was really good.  I am a huge fan of works burger, the burgers are huge and delicious with endless fries, a way better value and just up the street. Don't waste your time here, friendly staff but the food is terrible!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to a good burger, and I guess I bought into the hype, so I headed to Wahlburger's on my lunch break. Not such a great decision. I sat at the bar, where I was ignored by three indifferent bartenders for well over 5 minutes even though they weren't busy. The bar seats approx. 12 -15 people I guess, and there weren't more than 7 people seated at it, including me so I'm not sure why I had to wave the guy over in order to get a beer. 

Anyway, I ordered the \"Our Burger\" (which is supposedly what they built their rep on) and a side of onion rings. When my meal arrived, the burger itself looked great. The onion rings, on the other hand, did not. The menu describes the onion rings as \"crispy fried bermuda onion sliced thin, tossed in sea salt & parsley\", which apparently means a large bowl of onion strings - the type that belong as a burger topping, and which no one in their right mind would consider or attempt to eat as a side order.

As I said, the burger looked great, but looks were deceiving. A shiny, brioche-style bun was strangely hard, and the burger patty was dry and had the consistency of one that was previously frozen. The toppings were good. That's the best I can say about that. 

Service from the bartender didn't improve either. No one checked to see how my meal was, and it was up to me to motion them over so I could get a fork for the mouthful of onion straws that I ate (definitely not finger food) and later to get a refill on my beer. By the way, props for them at least offering a decent selection of draft instead of the usual macro brewed crap. 

Two beers, a very mediocre burger and a side of onion straws: $33.00."}
{"text":"I am giving a very generous 3 stars. I really wanted to like this place and it just was not good.  Service was fine, but the food was not.  I got an \"our burger\".  There was so much sauce it turned the bun soggy and the pickles had a fishy taste (so much so I pulled them off) the rest of the burger not a whole lot of flavor.  Put on some mustard hoping to make it better and it helped a little.  The location is fine and again, the service was fine. 

They also have a drink stand on the strip and the frozen margarita was actually very good..  as far as the food, I wouldn't go back.  When in the burger mood, I'll stick with in-n-out or fat burger."}
{"text":"I recommended this restaurant to an out of town VIP client that wanted a 'great burger'. They wanted to try something the Bay Area did not have; Five Guys and In 'N Out was out of the question. They also were not looking for a foie gras with gold flakes rendition of a burger. They just wanted a 'great burger'. I normally only recommend to my friends and clients places that I personally have made a cameo before, but somehow I don't know why I said \"Wahlburgers\". So off they go!  The next day, I see my clients and they asked why I had sent them there!  I will spare all of you the details my clients gave me, but I needed to try this for myself. So I decided to go the next day as soon as they opened around 11 a.m. so I could avoid the tourist lines.  Although there was no wait at around 11:30ish, there was a good deal of patrons already sitting inside the restaurant including the bar.  I decided to take a seat at the outside bar stool which was probably my biggest mistake. They air ducts pushing air out to keep bugs from coming in to the restaurant were at full blast!  I felt I was Donna Summers in concert when she sings in front of an air blower to push her wild hair all over the place!  I could have easily moved, but there truly was no other place to sit at the bar at this point.  I ordered a Blue Moon while the bartender brought me a menu.  As I took my first sip, I scanned the location of this property and it immediately gave me a flashback of when I was in Bangkok eating by the public markets watching a cobra being tamed! At least in Bangkok there was some great views...This location is containers converted to shops, and very loud. There is construction everywhere.  If you think you will have location of the Strip, think again....this is not the place for you.  But alas....I am here to review the food.  The burger was decent, nothing great.  I asked the bartender to substitute the raw onions for grilled, they decided to charge me the additional $1 for it even though it was a substitute.  Of course, when I got my burger, there was no onions at all.  I decided not to wait for the onions and told the bartender to 86 the onions from my bill. She didn't apologize, but just said she would take it off my bill.  

Overall, the food is okay.....the burger was good; cooked to my temperature, tater tots were nothing to brag about; you could find these at your local elementary school during mystery meat Friday's. The service.... not the best. They need to work on it.  Bartender was confused and truly didn't care whether or not the order was correct. You could tell she was just clocking in and clocking out to get base salary and tips.  

I can see why my clients from San Francisco lectured me on my choice of restaurant.  The two stars is for the ice cold Blue Moon I had and they were able to get my burger patty medium rare. Love the Wahlberg family; great actors and singers, but stick to your Calvin Klein panties and leave the restaurant industry to those who get it.  Also, I would look for a new scout location manager, no offense...could have done better with the property."}
{"text":"Very poor not good at all not worth the  money or the time.. I came from California to Lasvegas to eat this place! And it was not worth it ppl in there was not nice and the food was under cook never again I will go back here also I did speak with the manager his name is Edgar he was horrible he was very unrespectable and did not understand how me and my family felt they gave us undercooked food and I told him about it and he said they're sorry and that there is nothing he can do about it he didn't even offer to make my food again. Don't think he should be placed as a manager or that position of that kind of him not helping people the way how it is meant to be a manager I think Donnie Wahlberg kind of did better with his employment and stuff he needs to come back and take care of things I don't think it's right for them to give undercooked food to cook too customers! I give this place a thumbs down it is not worth taking your time or your family to this place I rather eat McDonald's then here sorry... Just speaking the truth"}
{"text":"actually 2 1/2 stars. Stopped in for a burger with a few buddies.The burger was good, the poutine was bad. The waitress was clueless. 
Overall just okay.
We would not return."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Overpriced Steak 'n Shake size burger patties. Bun was stale. Gluten bun was even worse!"}
{"text":"I would expect more specially i like the show, but it didn't really wow my taste buds. I ordered the melt burger and it end up being over cooked instead of my order of medium well. Theirs allot of employees standing around and just talking to one another instead of building connection with customers specially new ones whose just visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ate @ the Las Vegas Wahlburger eatery today and was far from impressed. Found out from the waitress the restaurant opened just last week so perhaps some of the issues are just growing pains for a new place. Waitress was cordial & attentive, but the wait for my wife's  burger, my ceasar salad & chicken strips for our son was over 45 minutes. Saw two tables just get up & go... tired of the wait.  Food was good, especially my wife's burger, but nothing extraordinary. Two Specialty  drinks were delicious, but pricey... but then what isn't in Las Vegas?  Caught an $8.00 billing error, which they gladly corrected. Total bill was $68 & change. $31 of that was the two drinks from the bar. Overerall, with all the choices available in LV this place needs to cut down the wait time."}
{"text":"We went fairly late in the night, after a long day in the city. The staff were super friendly, we didn't have to wait at all to be greeted and shown where to go order for take out. The girls behind the take out counter were really awesome in helping us make our decision. We had to wait a little for our food, but considering it is made fresh, the wait really wasn't that long. The quality of the food is awesomez fresh, hot and exactly how we asked for it. The fries were delicious and also stayed hot on our walk back to our hotel. 
I went in because of the show, but I will absolutely be returning because of the fantastic staff and delicious food.
I would highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I have ever tasted. Better than any other burger place on the strip!"}
{"text":"I fly in and out of YYZ a lot, thought I would try wahlburgers since I had time to kill before boarding. Sat at the bar, very friendly server. Ordered a BBQ bacon burger with poutine. 30 minutes went by, saw several people that came in after me get their food. Server came by and asked if I wanted anything else as if I was just finishing my drink and ready to go. When I asked about my burger she had a panicked look on her face and ran to check on it. Turns out it never got cooked. Had to take the burger to go and eat it on the plane since 45 minutes passed and my plane was boarding. Poutine was good, burger seemed average. Maybe it did not taste as good since the lame service pissed me off."}
{"text":"Great location, everything else sucks about this franchise. The pricing is high, even for the area. Let's not forget that by eating here you're also supporting Mark Wahlberg who violently attacked a Vietnamese man in a race related assault."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the menu.  Only about 1/4 of it was burgers, and I didn't feel there were any really unique options to choose from.  Of course it's located on the strip so it's over-priced, but my hubby and I paid $47 after tax & tip for 2 burgers, one side of fries and one side of tater tots.  His burger, the \"our burger\" with double patties and bacon was pretty good but I could've experienced the same quality at FatBurger or some hole in the wall burger joint for half the price or less.  Also, was not impressed at the LACK of motif in the restaurant.  The service was fine, but the restaurant...nothing special.  There are a million \"gourmet\" burger places on the strip. I suggest to go to any of the others..."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here after watching Wahlburgwrs on tv and all that jazz. I liked the onion rings and fries. But... the ranch dressing tasted like it was mixed with 100 proof balsamic vinaigrette? Why??? WHY. I wanted to cry."}
{"text":"Came here last night because my man and I had heard mixed reviews about Wahlburgers and wanted to try it for ourselves. Also, I've had a thing for Mark Wahlburg since my childhood, but don't tell my man that! 

The place is a lot bigger than we expected, with a seated table-service area in the front and take out in the back and upstairs. We liked the decor; it's perfect for the area with the Skydome (or Rogers Centre, whatever) nearby because it has a more upscale sports bar vibe. Good for groups and kids too! 

As for the food - I ordered the Thanksgiving burger (their turkey option) and regular tots, while my boyfriend ordered the BBQ Bacon burger with the sweet potato tots. We both really enjoyed our food. I will admit that the burgers do look a little small when you receive them (especially if you order the 5 oz. like I did), but these burgers are more about height than width and are definitely filling. The portions of tots are quite large, I had to get my boyfriend to help me out with mine. I will say that my tots were too salty and I kind of wished I ordered the sweet potato ones, as they were definitely more flavourful, but that's my own fault. I was also disappointed that there was no sparkling water and I was served tonic water instead. Yuck.

A burger and a side comes in just under $15, which is pretty standard for fancier burger places in Toronto. Not sure why so many people are complaining about the price when most are quick to shell out $12 for McDonald's and their mystery ingredients without a complaint...

Will be back."}
{"text":"Anybody that gives this burger joint more than 2 stars is obviously a friend on the payroll of the owners.
Went there today after a Blue Jay game around 4 PM.  Never been although we live around the corner.  But, hey gotta patronize local eateries, right?
Wrong.!~!!! 
The BBQ burger at $9.95 was as dreary as all the other reviews state.
It was Luke warm, small, and covered with a few extras that were all pretty much a mush of stuff.
Bun was tiny but I guess for the tiny meat patty it was in order. The bun was above cardboard by a bit.  Totally inappropriate for a specialty place that makes a big deal about its burgers.
No plate to dip your fries in ketchup so we put a nappy on the table and poured the ketchup on it. The fries were undistinguished and don't even give Big Mac fries a run for the money.
Thank goodness for Harvey's and their affordable and wonderful meat patties and real fries.
But if you drink enough of Wahlburger's booze you might be happy with the food."}
{"text":"Yummy! There was a wait for a table so sat at the bar. Fast service from the bar! Bartenders were very friendly and made you feel comfortable. The food was fast coming out- took less than 10 minutes. Tried the 1/3 burger, mama's sloppy joe and the Mac and cheese. The food was great, no complaints."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I was a bit disappointed here. After much time knowing about the restaurant, I was finally able to try it out while I was in Vegas and it didn't live up to all the hype. The prices are pretty high for the size of the burgers AND the sides. Ordered onions rings as a side and they came out as onion straws (needs to be said or shown clearly). Most expensive shake I've ever had and it was not anything special. Sadly I won't be trying it again :("}
{"text":"My family and I (husband and 18yr old, 13 and 14 yrs old) were walking the strip trying to find something semi-quick, we had tickets to a show, there wasnt a wait here  so we sat down. Waited about 10 min before we were waited on. Between us we got 3 cheeseburgers a hot dog, a cup of tater tots and a salad, 1 beer and 3 soft drinks came to 80.60! Sitting there waiting on our food, we wondered why some people had white paper cups while we had big green reusable cups, we find out when e got our bill! 4.95 a cup, we were not given the option for the disposable cups. For a family of 5 that quickly adds up. Cheeseburgers were good but daughters salad the cesaser dressing had no taste to it.  Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Expensive. 17 dollars for a burger and fry. Food is good but that's as expensive as the restaurants in Vegas and you'll leave hungry."}
{"text":"Not sure whether I should classify this place as a sport bar or a fast food burger place. My classic burger (aka Our Burger on the menu) was served cold, too small for me and nothing that I would say omg about. Burger priest is way better than here. Service was slow however since they just opened a few days ago, it will take them few weeks to settle down. Also they charge by default 18% extra for dine-in which is rare for this class of restaurant."}
{"text":"What a colossus disappointment, giving 1 star is being extremely generous!!. If you are looking for burgers and double burgers disguised as sliders, you will love it. As we open our meal and noticed this terrible burger, we called the manager and asked if by someway we received someone's else's kids order. She was no help ,,.,,.,,,,,,,don't want to ramble here but the Walburg  family should be ashamed of themselves serving this garbage....... My advice is if you want to enjoy a good burger, just go somewhere else, anywhere that serves a burger is better then this garbage ."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the family name, this place would be out of business. We had the thanksgiving sandwich and the melt. The thanksgiving sandwich was pretty flavorless and the melt was EXTREMELY greasy. And the music they play is all depressing 90s and early 2000s rock. Not the most upbeat when having a burger and cocktails. Pros: the drinks were good, the staff was friendly and the fries were nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Had such a blast here with my friends. Sat at the bar where you could enjoy the fresh air. They had vegetarian substitutes for my friend which our server informed us about. Abigail was very attentive to all of our needs."}
{"text":"Ordered the beast, added sautéed mushrooms and cheddar cheese. Pretty good tasting burger. Their french fries are the worst I have ever had. They have no flavor, no salt, very bland. The server is bot very attentive to refill drinks."}
{"text":"Yelp seems to really give Wahlburgers a hard time. People need to realize that is not a fancy place. It's your typical burger joint but with a little bit more. I love the food the service is great and it's my favourite place to go after a game. Yelp people need to stick to there own fancy places and stop picking on others."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the portion sizes and prices make it a difficult place to want to re-visit.  I had the chicken burger, which was juicy and spilling over with toppings.  Their buns are tasty, but too small for the burgers.

The deep fried tater tots were also quite good.  Really, how can a deep fried tater tot be bad?

My total for the burger and tots was $16 and change, with tip $20.  I'm also a pretty small person and I left hungry.

The restaurant is rather large and in a pricey, touristy area so I understand the pricing.  Unfortunately it means this will probably just be a tourist hang out."}
{"text":"Service at lunch time was so friendly.  Ordered a burger and tater tots and the house made lemonade.  Everything was so good. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lunchtime. 

Well what to say about this place. 
One its owned by a famous person which brought me here. 
Two l love the food here it's alway fresh and on time. Their garden salad are my favorite with a chicken burger."}
{"text":"Russell B at Wahlburgers Pittsburgh. Great service, great food and friendly staff. Clean bathrooms. Gluten free options are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Ok. $30 for two burgers and a small tater tots. Decent burger if you're in the area, but you can get way better for way less elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here but am sorely disappointed. The experience was ho hum. I wasn't going to review the place but when the outrageous bill came I knew I had to. 

Drinks
Adult Frappes- Fluffanuttahh and Mud Pie (to thick to drink out of their tiny straws and I doubt there is even any alcohol in there)

Food
The Melt and a Double Decker (bland, the wahl sauce didn't add anything special and the bun got soggy quickly)
Yukon Fries (tasted just like every other restaurant fry)
Onion Rings (best thing we ate)

Total cost $72.00!!!!

I could have got a real dinner for that price and it probably would have been memorable. 

I was also surprised at the bad restaurant arrangement. You don't realize until you sit down that you can order food from the counter to go and their isn't much sitting room. The room is super loud at 4pm. 

Other surprise- the lack of branding and cheap feel of the location. All drinks were served out of plastic and paper cups with no branding. Ketchup was a no-name brand. One wall mural, 1 family picture and a bunch of blank walls where something should be. 

Lastly the location is horrible. Behind all the weird little shops that feel like a flea market. I figured it would be open to the city and you're surround by walls. You'd think they have the money to choose a prime spot. 

Wasn't the experience I was hoping for and I wouldn't go back. 

Don't go unless your just wanting to look around. Your pocketbook will thank you."}
{"text":"Dear Wahlburgers - we are avid watchers of your show since day one, we have been really excited about coming to the Las Vegas location ever since we saw the beginnings of it starting to be built. Super bummed out tonight to come here after an incredible concert and have what tastes like frozen tater tot's and onion rings that were tasteless and disappointing as well as a barbecue burger with very little meat in the potty no taste of the guacamole, no sign of the tasty barbecue sauce we were hoping for and flavorless jalapeños. I'm bummed out because the burgers you promote on your show look amazing. You may want to come here quick and revamp this before it continues to go downhill. We hope you can put some TLC into this location so that I will be as good as the burgers we see on tv."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the \"Our Burger\" with onion rings & was not disappointed. The patty was cooked perfectly and paired nicely with the thinly sliced onion rings. I topped it off with a spiked lemonade. A great meal to get me through a night of Vegas drinking. Definitely coming back on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Really unimpressive fare.  I had the double decker with lettuce, tomato, pickles and Wahl sauce.  The patties were okay, frozen is my guess, but the bun just really stands out as the worst part of the experience - it was too large and the bottom was stale.  I had the 'crispy onion rings' as a side, which sounds great, however it's just a large bowl of frizzled onions - the kind The Keg serves with their steaks, only these are much less cooked and would make a better topping than a heaping bowl of lightly fried onion side dish. The decor is reminiscent of a Sobeys.   They actually sell 'Wahl Gear' in their gift shop.  You could find a better meal anywhere in the city."}
{"text":"Certainly an above average burger joint. When i walked in it seemed loud and crowded but it didn't feel claustrophobic when we sat down. The wait staff was laid back but friendly. Sports bar decor, with wall to wall flat screens showing sports and video montages. Being a Marky Mark fan, the shameless advertising didn't bother me so much as make me want to go home and netflix one of his movies.

The Menu descriptions are charming (\"Triple decker: a triple stack, like the house we grew up in\"). The topping combinations were appealing, I had the \"OFD\" with mushrooms, swiss, tomato jam and bacon, which was as you can imagine quite tasty. Poutine was good, the cheese was plentiful and the gravy was beefy. The onion rings were actually onion strings, which weren't bad, but i wouldn't choose it again. You did get a good portion size, though, since more were able to fit in the cup. 

The main thing: the patty. I have rather high standards and have never paid for one that is better than what my dad makes. But it didn't taste like a frozen or processed, it tasted like fresh ingredients. I was happy.

I left having had enjoyed myself.

Oh! and the hard plastic chairs were surprisingly comfortable!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot! We came on a Monday afternoon when it was not very busy. Had just a 5-10 min wait. The burgers were amazing, specifically the \"thanksgiving dinner\" burger, it's to die for! Glad I gave this place a shot."}
{"text":"This is a great burger place. I've been to the ones in Atlanta and Vegas. I especially love that you can get any burger patty on top of a salad."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight thinking it's probably decent and that previous reviewers got it wrong. Not so. 

The burger I got was a double BBQ bacon burger.  

The good:
Let me say that the flavours were pretty damn good! Good mix of jalapeño, avocado & sauce
Fries were good. Takeout service was friendly.

The bad: 
It was tiny! I was starving so I got a double thinking it would fill me up. Not so. These are not than much bigger than a slider in diameter at least. Fries & burger $17+-

Needless to say I won't be back. What could have been!!"}
{"text":"horrible, horrible, horrible.  food, service price.  it's an overpriced tourist trap.  Pease do yourself a favor, go to in n out."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Merchant booth and hung out with Brittany!!! Great conversation, awesome service! Definitely stop for a seat, a drink and a bit of cool air!! Thanks girl!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday around 1pm. It's was a 20 minute wait time.  Host staff seemed nice but didn't seem to know what was going on between the three of them!  After we were seated 10 minutes later our waitress came over just to tell us she would be with us in a moment.  We did not see her again for about 5 minutes. She asked what we wanted we just ordered two waters and waited another 10 minutes just to get water.  Now 20 minutes after being there we finally get something to drink and are able to order .  My husband ordered the 2 hot dogs and I ordered the Jenny Chicken sandwich.  We did not get our food for 35 minutes.  We had to ask for silverware and our waitress never asked if we needed refills for our drinks we had to ask her for refills and took her over 5 minutes to get us refills.  As we were eating we watched our waitress drop food on the floor clearing a table and clean it up with her hands.  I watched her and she never washed her hands she went and picked up a food order.  I will say the food was amazing but the wait staff will take this place under.  As much as I liked the food I probably won't be back due to the wait staff . All in all we waited over an hour to get food and drinks.   Our waitress name was Margaret and was very overwhelmed."}
{"text":"For a burger place, their burgers could really use some work...

Burger sizes are a bit disappointing, patty tastes okay (bit dry, not very flavourful), and buns were atrocious (super dry, cold bottom, flaky crumbly top). It reminded me of stale 5 day old buns. 

Pass on this and take your $15 somewhere else."}
{"text":"Jenn's chicken sandwich was amazing. Service was great (we sat at and ate into the bar) And honestly a pretty good price."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  30 minutes to get a side of fries after ordering glass of wine, which I had to remind my server twice to get the glass of wine.
Watched as customers were trying to get served , or served part of their order.....
Heard \" sorry about that\" over and over again by bartender-servers. They either need more help or a better system."}
{"text":"Fine I guess.  Nothing special at all. I hope it goes out of biz and is replaced with a shake shack. Service was fine but maybe weird. Burger was slop on a bun."}
{"text":"I'm just going to start out by saying that this was seriously the BEST burger I have ever eaten in my life and I love burgers but seriously hands down the best. My boyfriend and I had just flown out to Vegas 4th of July weekend which we so happened to stumble upon a sign that said Wahlburger  on the strip and in both our thoughts we were like okay we are definitely going to try this place while we are here. So we made it upon our selfs Friday to walk there to eat when we got the the place it definitely looked packed which it was the wait time was 45 minutes and we definitely did not want to wait that long so we just decided to go the next day (we didn't realize that it has just opened up)So Saturday we go there and it even looked busier then the last day which it was because the wait time now was 1 hour and 45minutes. Definitely was disappointed but we told our selfs that Monday we have to go there since it would be our last full day in Vegas because we were heading back home Tuesday evening. So Monday morning came and we got up early got ready and headed down to see when they opened (9am is when we went there) we found out that they opened at 11am we wanted a burger there so bad and to try it out that we waited all the time so we could be the first people inline. At about 10am the manager peeked his head out to just reassure to us that we knew they opened at 11 and then i responded to him assuring him that we new but we wanted to try the place so bad we didn't mind waiting because the last two days we had tried to come the the restaurant to eat but it was such a long wait. So finally it was 11 and sure enough we were the first people that got to be seated because around 10:20-10:30 a line started forming. Anyways the burger I got was the O.F.D my boyfriend got the double decker we also got sides of sweet potato tots and thin crispy onion rings and two drinks. We got our food so fast after we ordered everything the service I'm giving a 5 star because even when we were eating people who weren't even our server kept walking up to us asking if we needed anything or how everything was. We could not believe how amazing and good of quality the food was, the burgers were cooked so perfect and I highly recommend to anyone that you need to order the thin crispy onion rings they are seriously so goooooood!! And the most amazing part of the experience is that when we asked for our check the waitress told us that the manager wanted us to have it on the house because we waited all the time till they opened. So good service, great food and I liked the atmosphere also everyone must go! And if we could get one in Seattle I would honestly go like all the time"}
{"text":"No vegetarian options other than a portobello burger. Staff recommended the haddock as a vegetarian option. It's 2016."}
{"text":"Wahlburger finally comes to Toronto, it's been open for awhile. Even though the place is pretty close to me, I haven't tried it until tonight. Based on the reviews, it's been a mix of hits and misses, some likes it, some hates it. We decided to do the take-out instead of the restaurant part which was in the front of the restaurant. The take-out was at the back and they have seating at the back and some upstairs. You can avoid to pay the automatic 18% gratuity!

They have a variety of selection of burgers to chose from. I decided to try the Thanksgiving Day burger as it is the first time I have heard of it so it's worth trying. It is like having Thanksgiving leftovers on a bun with ground turkey, stuffing, orange cranberry sauce, roasted butternut squash & mayonaise. I actually like it, it wasn't as greasy compared to other beef burgers. And it went great with the stuffing and squash. The burger was unique, worth trying! The burgers are smaller compared to the other gourmet burgers, I was hungry after a few hours compared to others where I would be stuff for the night. We got some sides as well, the onion rings were really good. Not your usually one big ring but its shredded onions with seasoning and battered then fried.

The wait, even for take out was pretty long. As they serve in the same kitchen so they are cooking for the restaurant and take out. So if you are tight for time, you might have to leave some buffer time. We waited for about 20 minutes for the food.

Too bad, we did not see Mark!"}
{"text":"Seasoning goes a LONG WAY... they should try it! Tasteless and bland.  The burgers from my kitchen taste better.  The hotdog my kiddo got was the best thing served! Very disappointed.  I'd compare it to McDonalds... but if I had to choose, I think I'd pick McDs!"}
{"text":"Before heading back home to Los Angeles, My family and I finally had the chance to eat at Wahlburgers and ... it was worth the wait. My husband is very picky and he enjoyed it. He tried Mama's favorite (Sloppy Joe), I had Donny's favorite (BBQ, Jalapeño, Cheese and Avocado Burger), my uncle had the Classic Cheeseburger, and my 10 year old daughter had their JR. Cheeseburger (plain). As side orders we had Yukon Fries and Sweet Potato Tots which were delicious. We also ordered a Neapolitan milkshake... perfect with chunks of strawberries. The bill came out to $84 and change (little high), however the food didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place.  Love the tv show, love the story.  Don't love the menu, food or quality.

Not at all as one would expect.

Arrived to a 50 minute wait for a table.  Fine, if the food was to die for...but sadly the food was like a truck stop diner on the I-15. 

Waitress was a doll.  Loved her.  My husband and I looked at the menu and were puzzled.  Where are all of the specialty burgers?  Where's all of the pizzaz???  I asked the waitress, \"Stupid question, but, is this the full menu?  I thought there were specialty burgers?\"

Sadly, our waitress notified us that this IS the full menu..all 6 or so burgers.  Nothing to write home about (except that they use \"government\" cheese and some Wahl sauce which on one seems to know what it is).

Ordered the BBQ burger with avocado.  Yuck!!! The edges had very clearly been pulled from a pre-cooked 6 pack of buns.  There were tell tale signs of the leftover bread tag from the other buns.  I grabbed it, and, the whole bottom was cold.  Yes, cold.  The burger patty was maybe 1/8 inch thick, crusty and bent, hanging over the smooshed bun.  There was maybe one slice of avocado on the whole burger and even less BBQ sauce.

The fries were old and dry.  The sweet potato tater tots were definitely pre-cooked and frozen.

Booo.  I really, really wanted to like this place.  Sadly, won't ever be going back."}
{"text":"In one of the busiest cities! I stopped here for a quick meal, sat at the bar and was greeted by bartender Rodrigo! I ordered the chopped salad bowl with a water as well as a rum and pineapple and the mix was perfect. Delicious.It's so hard in Vegas to find someone who is so friendly and at the same time professional with great service in the food industry. Thank you!"}
{"text":"People need to realize it is a soft opening. With that said, I thought it was great! Great service and great atmosphere. I think it'll get better with time once they get ahold of things. Their patty melt was so good. Their mustard was amazing (and homemade) and I'm not a mustard fan. The onion rings are so so so good!"}
{"text":"I expected a lot more coming here due to the celebrity status and the fact that they have a tv show about the restaraunts. 

To start, we entered and one of the grills was broken so they were only able to seat 30 people so we were wait listed but asked to leave while we waited.

When our table was ready we were put at a 2 top squished in the corner, I kid you not... Squished. 

Our server was nice but not on top of things. We ordered and she didn't write it down properly I guess so she had to come back and ask twice what we ordered. My drink was also empty and she walked by multiple times and I had to stop her to order another drink. 

The food took a while and when It came it was barely warm- almost cold. The burger was kind of dry and lacked flavour (our burger) and my boyfriend had \"the melt\" which he was disappointed it was just a burger in between two peices of bread which were grilled. tater tots were awesome but they were cold when they came out. 

Overall, we wanted to see what the hype was about but won't be returning. Over priced for what it is. If you want a great burger joint- hit up holy chuck burgers at yonge and st. Clair !"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited that Wahlburgers was coming to Toronto, but waited until the hype was over before I gave it a try, plus with the mixed reviews, I didn't make it a priority for my to-go places to try.

For being an establishment from the Wahlberg brothers, I was expecting a great place, good service and amazing food, but was quite disappointed that it didn't deliver according to the hype.  It was comfort food, but at gourmet sizes and prices.

Upon entering through the first door, there's a warning on the wall of being videotaped or recorded, then through the second door, there's brightness from all the greenery decor.  Decent size seating area with full-sized bar and lots of TVs throughout the restaurant.  Like other Yelpers had commented, it felt like I walked into a sports bar.

Luckily there was some sort of walkway that guided me to the ordering counter.  Menu  items were clearly displayed and I thought the prices were quite reasonable because normal prices for good burgers with fries in restaurants ranges from $12 - $18 on average.

I came late Sunday afternoon and there was no line-up, but a group of people waiting for their orders off to the side. The cashier didn't seem friendly and I felt like I had bothered her with my smile while I waited for her to acknowledge me so I can place my order.  

I managed to place my order of BBQ Bacon Burger ($9.95) and Yukon Gold Fries ($3.50), then proceeded to the side to wait while observing the staff.  The two cashiers didn't look happy and the kitchen staff looked miserable from what I saw and it wasn't even that busy. 

Although I indicated that I was dining in to the cashier, receipt showed takeout, hence, my order came in a white paperbag with the Wahlburgers logo even when I tried to stop the other cashier from placing my food in the paperbag informing her I was dining in.  So much for trying to save a paper bag. Nice packaging for the burger and cute container for the fries, but what a major disappointment when I opened the burger box.  I was very shocked to see how small the burger was.  

For the price of $9.95, I was expecting a normal size burger, but what I received was a burger that resembled something slightly larger than a slider. Plus the bun looked like it was manhandled with all the dents on it.  I was hungry, so took a quick photo before taking my first bite.  I wasn't impressed at all.  Too much BBQ sauce that seemed to overpower the burger, cheese wasn't melted all the way, plus I only tasted avocado near the end and almost forgot it was part of the burger.  It seemed like they forgot and only placed a dollop of avocado, perhaps that explained the manhandled bun which didn't taste fresh. The saving grace was the bacon which was done nicely and crispy.

The fries were quite tasty and I ate them plain since it was nicely salted, but for $3.50 it just doesn't seem worth the price for the small amount I received.

I think I would rather have my burger and fries elsewhere.  At least I can say I tried Wahlburgers.  Sadly, this will be my first and last visit."}
{"text":"Going to Wahlburgers was like kissing marky mark with Hollywood cheese and special mayo for a good hour or so. Yum yum yum...."}
{"text":"This place sucks. McDonald's is a step above. Burger sucked. Fries sucked. Service was mediocre. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"I first eat at your restaurant while in Vegas and loved it! And now that you have a restaurant in Pittsburgh we have eaten there twice now.. Thank you so much for com I g to my hometown!! Steelers Nation"}
{"text":"Meh - food was cold when we got it.  Service was very slow.  The onion rings - weren't.  Looked like a blooming onion from the Outback met TNT.  Also flavorless.  The special sauce was MIA, and the Cesar salad was warm and limp.  Not worth the price or the on TV hype.  Staff seemed confused and lacking in any motivation whatsoever.

Disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great cheeseburger and French fries here. Sat outside on the patio and the atmosphere was very nice and cool despite the Las Vegas evening heat. A three piece band was playing in the courtyard which added to the festive atmosphere. After so many super expensive Vegas restaurants, I was glad that this one didn't break the bank. My local $5 beer called Bonanza was also tasty. Total bill was about $15 or so."}
{"text":"First - what I liked - the burger itself. I got their basic Wahlburger, and it tasted like something that you would have on your back porch at a good bbq party. I liked it. And yes, it was $9 - but that's what you're going to pay for a burger in downtown Toronto.

I also liked the multitude of sports screen options, and plenty of tables to sit at. The hostess was very nice and sat me promptly.

What wasn't so great - I get that it's Wahlburgers - but do we have to see a loop of everything Mark and Danny Wahlberg have done their whole lives? It plays on the screen 24/7 - and it more makes you realize this guys have been in more duds than actual hits. Don't get me wrong - I like Mark W. (was never really an NKOTB fan - nothing against Danny), but I don't need this.

I think people are going to find the prices too high, and the fad of it may wear off quickly, but I would probably eat there again in a pinch. Let's face, Gretzky's across the street isn't known for having reasonably priced fare, and that's been there forever."}
{"text":"Burger........it was ok but nothing special, not for ten bucks. The fries........a scrawny order made from frozen fries, came to the table luke warm. Three and a half bucks. Service...........fast, but it felt like they wanted me to eat and get out of there.

There are some way better burger joints in this city, and some of them even have fresh cut fries. I'll keep going back to my regular burger stop."}
{"text":"Woth the $14+ for lunch.  Nope. I was the only person in the take out line at lunch time.  After ordering their most basic burger and an order of fries.  I asked the cashier what \"government\" cheese was..I was embarrassed for her when she mumbled.. sans emotion  \"it's a Kraft single\" .  After ordering, I waited and waited and waited.  As the cashier tapped her pen on the counter I interupted her daydream to ask if there was any faster service for take out orders or am I in line with all the dining room orders (btw the dining room was quite full) Her response was simple.  No faster service for take out.  Great so I continued to wait with anticpation. When I got back to the office and opened the box, I was horrified to see a shrivelled bun with what I think was a hamburger patty. Was too small to actually tell.  Save your money people of Toronto.  Even if the food was good (and the cheese was actually cheese) I would avoid this place with their lack lustre service and unfriendly staff.  Walberg family, you can do better."}
{"text":"Really good food and service. The thanksgiving day burger is delicious. The atmosphere inside is a bit weird with the bright green chairs but the food and service makes that better. The fries are really good as well."}
{"text":"The food was good, once we finally saw it.  We went for lunch at 2 in the afternoon and waited 50 minutes for a few sandwiches and two salads.  When we asked how much longer it was going to be, the server said he would check and never came back.  Overall, with the amount of choices, I just don't think you should have to wait that long for a burger."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out since my friends and I were all hungry. I got the Our Burger and it was okay. I'm a big fan of pickles and their pickles were too dry. I was excited because their pickles were big and then got disappointed. Price paid wasn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"First time here and probably the last.  Met friends who came up from out of town at 2pm on a Saturday.  Was told 30-35 minute wait for a table when we got there.  25 minutes later we were seated.  Pleasantly surprised, as I had read negative reviews about longer than expected wait times.  We waited a little longer than normal for our waiter to come by, and by that time we had already looked over the menu and were ready to order, so he took our drink and food order at the same time.  Didn't have to wait too long on drinks.  Our food came out about 50 minutes after we'd been seated.  Nothing to write home about.  It wasn't horrible  but I've had better burgers.  It was an enjoyable lunch with friends I hadn't seen in a while, but next time we'll meet in the burbs with plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"Wahlbergers, good TV show, burgers - not so much. Had a Paul's special last night. Kind of a cross between an In-and-Out single and a single pattie BigMac. Sent the first one back because it was undercooked and cold like it came from the refrigerator. Second one was warmed to room temperature (still not hot enough to melt the cheese). They felt bad so they gave me a 20% discount off the $12 burger. Awesome, $10 for a room temperature burger and $14 for a beer... I feel special?"}
{"text":"Excellent service and friendly staff upon arrival.  I loved the menu, nothing too lengthy, but creative enough burgers to add some variety. 

I asked for recommendations and the waitress obliged. I decided on the chili to start, the OFD Burger, and the onion rings. 

Chili-  really good flavor and extremely hearty.  
Rings- a giant basket of thinly sliced and fried rings straws with a garnish and sauce.  Good flavor, but couldn't eat the full side. 
Burger-  super soft bun and a great burger with a good variety of flavors stacked on top of a 1/2 lb burger patty.

Really really good meal, and excellent service.  I even contemplated buying a shirt, but had to leave."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. It's nice looking, the staff is friendly, and it definitely has appeal with the Wahlberg family name behind it.

But restaurants are about food. My wife and my two teenage children ate here. The \"chopped salad\" was just lettuce on a plate, the onion rings had virtually no onions to speak of, and the burgers were flavourless. My daughter liked her Mac and Cheese, but you really have to be incompetent to bung that one up.

So expensive, tasteless food? \"Eek! Methinks\" is a well-earned rating. Sad, really, especially with all the smiling faces on the walls and the motto of \"Making you happy, makes us happy\" plastered everywhere. I really felt ripped-off eating here."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service at the bar, would of been better off at a table. Bartender looked to be new, might be since this place just opened but you have to be able to at least keep an eye on your customers. Had to ask for everything, to order, refills, check. Trying to pay the bill, took almost 10 minutes and at an airport people stopping in for a quick bite to eat don't have a lot of time."}
{"text":"The wife and I love the show so we had to visit the Vegas location. The staff was very friendly and the Burgers were fantastic. The bill for two Burgers and a Drink came to 54.00 a bit steep and would return but wouldn't make a special trip due to the prices. 5 Star for the good Food,and great staff. Was a very clean establishment. If you order a drink from the bar and want the plastic cup be ready to give up a 20.00 Bill I guess that is what increased our bill."}
{"text":"Oh my this place is all it's cracked up to be!!! The burgers are insane and the onion rings are so freaking awesome and to top the night off with a New England favorite grilled fluff peanut butter chocolate and banana sandwich holy cow!!!! The service was great the atmosphere an over all great time and recommend for everyone to try!!"}
{"text":"Never expect much for airport food. Took 10 minutes just for one of the three bartenders working to ask me for my drink order. Got the caeser salad which was really nothing special. No check in by any of the three bartenders who didn't seem busy at all. Off putting smell from beer taps which clearly had not been cleaned or sanitized made clear by the swarming black flies. Pretty gross and pathetic overall experience at this joint."}
{"text":"There wasn't anything hint too unique with the burger, so in terms of price it's overpriced.  Got the Our Burger (around 10 Canadian dollars).  Meat is heavier than say a regular cheeseburger from In and Out.  But taste wise, it was similar to a burger you would get from a BBQ at a park.  Fries were good, better than In and Out (crispier, more golden).

Service was decent."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars food was shitty, But i really enjoyed Pain and Gain. #bluebloods #coldfood #thisresturantdissapointedthefunkybunch"}
{"text":"My husband chose Wahlburgers as his birthday dinner.  There were 5 of us.  We were a little nervous because there was an Indians game and a Cleveland and a concert at the Q - but our wait was only about 20 minutes. After we were seated, we ordered 4 waters WITH LEMON and a bourbon beer and sweet potato tater tots to start.

The tater tots were absolutely delicious.  Waitress forgot the lemons, and they ran out of the beer we wanted.  They also \"ran out of cups, but got the plastic ones ones our water was served in from \"somewhere\" - a little sketchy\" 

Anyway, on to food, we had 3 burgers, they were good, not the best I've ever had, but not the worst either.  A portabella mushroom burger, was good.  And a Mom's sloppy joe - which my mom said was good.  So over all the food was good.
Also ordered the onion rings (which were really onion straws), but in my opinion were the highlight of the dinner. 

A few things:
* they didn't have lemons (despite being a restaurant and full service bar)
* the special Wahl-sauce tasted like ketchup, mayo and water
* the BBQ sauce tasted just like the Wahl-sauce
* they \"ran out of cups\"
* I don't understand the wire baskets instead of plates, plastic silverware and paper cups format - I wish it wa
* the waitress had \"no clue\" what the feature burger was
* the check in process was a pad of paper, which the host wrote our name and phone number - took forever 
* despite being seated within 20 minutes, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to greet us, and then about 30 minutes for the food to come to the table 
* everything was ala carte - so the $9 burger, plus $3.50 side was pretty expensive for \"average\"  especially if you want a 

Overall I think it was good - and hopefully because it's new they are going through growing pains, and once they get their ordering system up and running, as well as fully trained staff (our waitress was not knowledgeable of anything and kept using the phrase \"I have no clue\") things will get better!"}
{"text":"I always like to address the positive first: Last night (sat not busy at all) The burgers were absolutely amazing.  however, here is why the 3 star rating --the wait staff were extremely slow to busy talking to other staff instead of serving customers .  We were sitted within 5 min,  it took the wait staff 20 minutes to ask us if we wanted anything to drink or if we were ready to order?  For a fast food Burger place it took an additional 40 min to get our burger. The burgers were amazing (thanksgiving day burger) the tots and fries not so much. The establishment is very small, the price is very expensive.  Two burgers two fries and two soft drinks 44.00 Cad. Fries are charged extra. Would I go back yes.. But take out less the fries, wait staff need to be spoken too"}
{"text":"This is a solid burger joint. Sat barside and had no issues being seated immediately. The environment was exactly what was expected, busy, chatty, friendly and fun. TVs displayed local sports teams (Cleveland Indians) as well as a Wahlberg family mash up (Donnie killled the Dance off portion by the way) that was hilariously delightful. Food was delivered very promptly and taste was delicious. Only gave four stars because of price in comparison to other burger joints. Would definitely recommend visiting though!"}
{"text":"Got my burger wrong...did not even apologize for that mistake. Rude server....Over priced been there done that won't go back EVER...."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  They should fire the Manager who was working on Sunday afternoon Nov 13 2016.  I sat at the bar and order a drink and food - got the drink but no food!  30 minutes later I enquired and it was discovered my order was never entered into the system.  The problem is they are over staffed with employees more interested in talking to each rather than serving customers.  The Manager was oblivious and the kitchen consistently had 3-4 employees standing around talking.  Unless your flight is delayed - stay away until the get a decent manager who cares and they train their staff!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here once before and had a great experience. But as I stand outside I wish I could give this restaurant lower than a one star. This \"hostess\" staff is the rudest individuals I've ever encountered in Vegas. The hostess was so rude she even spoke with her coworker talking crap...it was beyond unprofessional."}
{"text":"Been here 2x the last 2 days for the official opening days.  Food was outstanding and we didn't wait longer than 15min for food either time.  Team is fast and efficient even though they are learning to handle all the business.  I loved the \"Our Burger\" and my husband has had the \"Donnie BBQ burger\" the last 2 days. He loved it.  Onion rings are out of this world and so is the Smores Frappe with marshmallow vodka.  Either visit we were here, we did not have an issues with greasy food at all."}
{"text":"We each ordered a burger and they were good, but it all came out within 5 minutes which makes me believe that the food was not cooked fresh to order. We shared an order of fries, which had the potential to be good if they were hot and fresh out of the fryer, but they weren't. The major problem for me was the service - I've had better service at Applebee's. With most restaurants having great service on the Las Vegas strip, Wahlburgers really needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the show and I was really lookin forward to trying this place out but it was nothing special. The burger didn't have much flavor and I asked for my fries to be extra crispy but they weren't. 

On top of it all, it was a lot more expensive than I expected. I don't see how they could charge people that much for the quality of food they serve. Don't see myself coming back here unfortunately. Good luck to Marky Mark though!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the show but sadly I didn't enjoy the restaurant. We had a party of six and our server missed taking down half of our order probably do to the overly loud music playing in the background. The food we did receive took waaaaay to long and just really wasn't impressive. Because of that I feel they're overpriced. I did like the souvenir picture they took for purchase towards the end of our meal and bought it. I'm glad to have experienced wahlburgers but honestly will never go again."}
{"text":"Great flavor burger.... Wife absolutely loved the onion rings, and the service was good... Would go back."}
{"text":"Waiting over an hour for Burger and tater tots.
Don't go here unless you have a lot of time to waste"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here while we were in Vegas and left feeling disappointed and kind of ripped off.

We stopped in to get a snack and saw that the Double Decker was described as \"two 3 ounce burgers\" and understood that to mean that we would get two burgers, each with a three ounce patty, and that we could split that. My boyfriend asked for \"the two 3 ounce burgers\" and we also ordered fries and the bacon mac and cheese.

What we got was two orders of the double decker, and by \"two 3 ounce burgers\" they actually mean two 3 ounce patties so we ended up with twice as much food as we meant to order. When we told our server, he didn't seem to understand the confusion and didn't offer a solution.

Along with what I feel is confusing menu language and a lack of customer service, the mac and cheese was watery and flavorless and the fries were average.

The burgers were actually really tasty but overall we didn't have a good experience here and won't be returning next time we're craving burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed the burgers. They weren't the BEST burgers we'd ever had, but they were still pretty decent (maybe we were just super hungry from walking around the Strip all day, haha). The staff & cashiers at the to-go station were friendly. The only thing we didn't like about this place was how small & crowded it gets. Also, this place doesn't have an actual customer restroom which was a little weird. And they could've sat people in the patio section but it was closed that afternoon for whatever reason. Our burgers & fries also came out pretty fast, so that was good. We would come back in the future."}
{"text":"Got their signature burger and it was meh. Bun was interesting and the sweet potato tots were a nice change from regular fries. It was soooo salty though - definitely have had better burgers for the same price."}
{"text":"Sorry Walburg family but someone need to QC this property 
Food was below average , service was horrible . I think you would be better off to send staff home instead of offering the most unfriendly service . These girls made Air Canada look good and that's a tough one"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely disgusting, no taste. Everything was blend. The food was overpriced, the portion is small. This place is overrated, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Vegas Baby!!!! Yeah, we stopped here after some major shopping at the outlets!  All the walking made us hungry for some meat!  We ordered The Melt......delicious, greasy, wonderful!!!! Added extra mushrooms.  We also tried the regular burger, fries and onion rings.  Fans of the fries, but would not reorder the onion rings.  Not what we were used to.  These are very lightly breaded red onion \"strings\".....We also ordered the Margaritas.....just average machine style frozen....low on the alcohol content.  We tried the pina colada...better than the Margarita...but not great.  Just go with a coke and drink alcohol elsewhere!  Otherwise....loved the Melt!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately. Our waiter was great. Made several good suggestions. One of which was the white Sangria. I was not disappointed. Walked into restaurant just after lunch rush. Restaurant was a little messy. I ordered the BBQ Bacon and a side of Mac and Cheese. Both were terrific. My husband ordered the Fiesta Burger and also was not disappointed. We will definitely go back when in the area again"}
{"text":"They don't give 2 shits about handicapped. THERE IS NO PARKING IN FRONT OF THE RESTURANT FOR EITHER PICK UP OR HANDICAPPED. You litterally have to park at ballys. Drive around in ballys parking looking for a spot, go down to Ballys, walk through Ballys fighting the drunk crowd all the way, only to get lost...double back fighting the crowd again. Nope wrong exit...AGAIN! I gave up and went back to my car in agonizing pain from my bad leg. Thanks a phuqueing lot Walhburger."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this new burger spot. Don't waste your time or money. Lets start with the atmosphere; bright, cartoonish and very spread out. Wait staff was friendly, but the host was clueless. Moving on tothe drinks, stick to beer or soft drinks. Terrible wine and cocktails, sent 3 back. The spiked cherry coke tasted like cough syrup and the strawberry something tasted like sour cotton candy. When taking our food order, the server recommended the burger be medium well. Hmm. Never heard that at a burger joint. Very small menu, could be a food truck. Food was just ok. Burgers lacked flavor. For 2 drinks, 2 burgers, tots and onion rings, the bill was $70. Don't mind paying for a good experience, this wasn't one. And btw, spent most of my night in the bathroom. Yuk!  Also notice that corporate only thanks good reviews, how 'bout a sorry for all the unhappy diners. Stick to the burger you know...."}
{"text":"I was finally able to try whalburgers and it was  one of the bests I've had. Environment is clean and sleek. Atmosphere and service is friendly and upbeat. The place was busy , but our order was taken promptly. Food was delivered in a timely manner as well. Definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Tried checking in thru Facebook but it couldn't locate it.   My daughter and I both had the Our Burger and split an order of Sweet Potato Tots.

It was okay.  My bun was a little soggy from the grease.  I really couldn't tell it had a special sauce on it.

Overall the food, service, etc. was fine.   It's not a place I'd specifically go back to eat but would if we were in the neighborhood and someone in the group wanted to go check it out."}

I had the Our Burger, it was cooked well and the flavours were awesome! Great prices for Las Vegas strip! I want to come back! Tomorrow!!

Thank you Wahlburgers!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I came down to Las Vegas for Christmas and decided in making Wahlburgers our Christmas Eve dinner which turned out to be the best thing we could've done. The food was fantastic like out of this world phenomenal no joke but that truly wasn't the best thing about this place. The best thing about Wahlburgers is their server Ross. My God this man was exceptional. Since my husband is military we've been lucky enough to eat all over this world and this wonderful man is The BEST. I really hope management sees this and gives him the recognition he so rightfully deserves. Thank you Ross for making us so happy, you went beyond regular service."}
{"text":"Let me start with I sooooo wanted to be blown away by the food. 
The staff is plenty nice. But I must wonder why any restaurant would employ a vegan waitress in a restaurant that specializes in HAMBURGERS!?!
She was super nice but knew nothing about how the food was. 
The bacon Mac and cheese ... Cmon!!!! 8 bucks for this?!!!
We got the melt and the bbq bacon burger. Both were subpar ... I felt like the burgers at dang red robin are better. The fried onions are a upset stomach waiting to happen. The sweet potato tots are all right but ehhh... Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"If you want a perfect, fresh burgers that doesn't remind you of chains, this is the place!  Picked the Our Burger and the flavors were amazing! Try the tater tots too!! Clean, efficient and great staff. All we needed was an actual Wahlburg and the night would have been complete!"}
{"text":"Decent cheeseburger. Mine was well done, just like I ordered it. The bun was soft and warm. 15 minute wait, considering it was peek time on a Friday. Everything is a la carte. Tater tots are great"}
{"text":"Sorry to say. But this place is not worth the time or the money. Kitchen entirely too slow and wait time for food 1 hour 45 minutes   Waited over 10 minutes for check. Burgers were just ok. I was just whelmed. Don't expect much here. I know everything is more expensive on the strip but this is rediculous. Also the place was way too loud and the manager Miguel also made racist comments that included saying\"we need more Mexican cooks\".  The only bright spot was our server Alex. She did her best to give decent service but her efforts were hampered by her other staff and kitchen help."}
{"text":"Great place to come to while you're in Vegas. I was really craving a burger and Wahlburgers really satisfied my hunger. The service was great. We were told that the wait on a table would be 20 minutes, but it turned out to actually be about less than 10. Being quite honest, my prime fascination for this place is because of Mark Wahlberg and also because there isn't a Wahlburgers in Texas yet. They had a good selection of drinks and a variety of burgers. I chose a regular beef patty burger and the patty was pretty thick and juicy. I would definitely visit this place again, especially if Wahlburgers comes to Texas."}
{"text":"We thought that based on the show the service would be great and the burgers good... Service was not what one would expect and the 18% gratuity for poor service is a joke!  We were 5 adults and one child so this was a group of six and told ofthe mandatory gratuity.  If you have this fee then service your clients to prove the tip is worth it!!

Burgers were good however, A bit greasy...
Long ticket time!
Menus were in very poor shape considering it recently opened... You don't see this mess on the show!!!  Go to the Toronto location... You will all agree!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was better than the other reviews on Yelp. My wife wanted to go because she loved NKOTB and this will probably be the only time we will get to try it. I had the Our Burger with Bacon. It was really good. The lemonade was made from real lemons but was a little tart. I had to add a few packs of sugar. The price was reasonable for touristy Vegas. The wait staff was really nice and kept checking on us to make sure we were taken care of. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Two of our orders were wrong. My husband asked for a refill, they took his cup with a straw, when he got it back it lots of lipstick on it. We had to exchange for new one.  Then when the bill came we saw pop/coke was 1.99. We were charged $5.99 per drunk times 5. Really! We asked why they said because we got collector cups. Really we never asked for them. They said if you Don't wants them you need to let them know. Bad, bad business. So it cost us $24 for soda total rip off. Should have been $10. Las Vegas location."}
{"text":"Meh. 

Not at all what I expected (I don't really know WHAT I was expecting...) but I do like that they have dining with a BAR up front and your typical take away in back.

That's where the positives stop. The burger is dry with zero flavour. I'm all about showcasing the meat flavour in a good piece of beef but these aren't so go ahead and throw some s&p on that sucker.  

Really nice staff and the tots are top notch (but you can't really eff up tots so...)"}
{"text":"We watch the show and are fans of Donny and Mark but dissapointed in food and service. They sat us at table where sun was beaming on us so we decided to eat outside. I ordered Mac n cheese the top of it was good the more I got to the center the drier it became. Hubby ordered dad burger which was nothing special. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The burgers are really good, but they are overpriced.  You can get a better burger for a lower price at many other locations."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.

Not impressed with the decor. The prices, including the drink menu, were on the high end of average. The place seemed to want to have a home-y feel, but it just didn't. Plastic green chairs don't seem to work with $15 drinks- it just seemed gimmicky. Pictures of the Wahlburgs everywhere, obviously, and TVs playing clips from Mark's movies. I don't know what else I expected, but it seemed a little weird.

Food- the food actually was good. The burger, which was around $11, was fantastic! It didn't come with sides, which made it overpriced. The group I was with got tater tots and onion rings as sides. The tater tots were good, the onion \"rings\" were actually the kind of crispy onions that are supposed to go on a burger. Good, but hard to eat? 

The 2 stars were for the very good burger, the three missing are for the service. The server forgot both of our sides. She mentioned that they had just opened, which I totally understand, but her forgetting to put in half of what we ordered has nothing to do with them just opening. Their debit machine was down for a few minutes- THAT is 100% not her fault. Putting the order in was. Service was also slow, and we'd been finished for at least 15 minutes before anyone came to see if we were done, wanted a bill, etc.

Also, 18% service charge. Really? Someone below said that if you complain about 18% you shouldn't be eating there, but I disagree- it's the principle. I always try to tip decently well. (Management wise- I wonder if the servers SEE all of those tips.....) 

I would go again for take out only. Not to dine in. And even so, for the price, I'd probably end up elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was Sooooo looking forward to eating at Wahlburgers while visiting Vegas. Boy,,,,was I highly disappointed from the moment we arrived at the \"Restaurant \" the host at front door was less than inviting and even less helpful.  Once we FINALLY got to sit at the bar it took quit a while before one of the 5 people behind the bar to greet us let alone ask what we would like to drink.
It took equally as long to take our order of food. With great expectations we waited and waited to finall
y receive \"Our Burger\" /Sloppy Joe/ salad and forgotten tots. I couldn't help but be so sad and laugh at how ridiculous. Waitress was more concerned with chatting with the other 4 to 5 people behind the bar.  Prices are to high for what you get and even higher for food that is high school cafeteria level. 
I can not believe this is the standards the Wahlburgers want.....  I think the bothers need to come out here and straighten manage and staff out ASAP.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make it right !!"}
{"text":"After all the tv show hype, it was nice to experience Wahlbutgers past its Boston Homebase

The decor at the Post-security US departures is hip and modern , nice bulkheads with lettering with green themed seating and murals.  There are communal very wide tables seating up to 8 people each which is a
Nice touch, as is the \"cheers\" style round bar with great beers on tap and classic rock
Serving as the background soundtrack.  The take out kiosk was very greasy spoonish with what appeared to be prepackaged muffins in a clear display and a bunch of cliff bars... Meh... 

Now for the menu, I got excited about the OBF burger which is an 8oz grain fed beef patty for $11.95. Except... It only comes with \"house made tomato jam, bacon, Swiss cheese & sautéed mushrooms\".  Well I only wanted an 8oz patty with lettuce tomatoes pickles and red onions and they said they can't do that as \"their cash register  system isn't set up for
Those extra ingredients\".  

Well that makes no sense!  Take away the nice decor and This is a greasy spoon that is waaaaay overhyped from The family brand name's fame.  Modern or not, it didn't leave me the best of impressions especially for something this simple as ordering what I wanted on their 8oz party which only goes with the OFD; keep your OFD I want to make my own when the ingredients were not what I wanted!  Locally, Hero burger and others offer a flame broiled propose burger with healthy ingredients and sides along with a price point that may be high but comeasurates with the overall experience, not this tv show hyped grease hole!

In the age of Chipotle style \"have it your way\"; $11.95 for a mediocre burger that is super extra greasy (the meat was fatty and the bun was bathing in the buttery spread it was smothered in) is not acceptable, airport or not!

Wahlbutgers is not worth the hype and the price for the experience and all the grease it oozes ... Next!"}
{"text":"The food was not bad at all. I ate a burger with no meat (I did not want to pay the crazy $20 for a veggie burger. 

The fries were done well , not greasy and lightly done and fluffy inside.  

No complaints , about the food , only thing $65 for 3 Our burgers , fries,  a Coke,  Soda water and coffee was a little much for me (considering I did not have meat ). 

I know it is  the strip , but for locals like us it is kind of a detour , having to pay tourist price .

You get to keep the cups and if you can eat in under and hour , the parking is free."}
{"text":"Walked in around 4pm was greated right away. Our waitress was very nice. Swensons is still the best burger in Northeast Ohio but this was #2 in my adventures. The onion rings were unreal good and it was huge you won't find rings better. The tots were tots nothing fantastic. I got the double bacon cheese burger and it was cooked perfect to how I wanted it. Will be back hopefully we get one on the west side"}
{"text":"Service was great--- sat at the bar-bartender was pleasant/friendly and helpful. Food arrived timely. Cocktails were delicious. Our burgers were soo fresh and good and the special sauce is yummy!!! A fun vibe as soon as you walk in. Would recommend to anyone who is in Toronto and it's in a great location! Will def come back when I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Wahlburgers on the Strip!!! Wow what a great burger! Simple yet tasty, light yet bursting with flavor and way cheaper than many competitors on the strip. My Husband and I went to a more expensive celebrity chef restaurant in Planet Hollywood known for its burgers and Wahlburgers blew them away, no competition. We had the Our Burger and thin crispy onion rings. If you sit at the bar you'll be delighted by the bar manager Emma with the greatest customer service."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger I've ever had!!! I'm a fan of Paul's work ethic and passion for what he does, my boyfriend and I were going to do a seafood buffet but took a taxi to Ballys instead just to try Wahlburgers.  The staff was amazing, the best service I've yet to receive at a restaurant that didn't cost me 300 bucks.  Sat down and was served waters in a to go cup which was an awesome touch, my boyfriends Guinness was poured perfect, cascading down the cup as we decided what to eat.  Best freaking fries I've ever had!!! Onion rings were the string type which our server came out with two Wahl sauces and forks on his own, prime touch! We got the regular Wahlburger which is Paul's favorite, didn't add a thing to it and stoked we didnt.  I got the Wahlbrewski from a local brewer and loved it.  They come around and ask if you want a picture (free) they come later with no pressure to buy and give you a free postcard to keep.  Not gonna lie it was worth the cab fare and small wait time. I wouldn't take time to write if I didn't feel so passionately about it.  My first yelp review.  It's worth the hype!  Good job guys on pushing your brothers food to the world!  Well done to management for pushing your staff to be the best!!! Please keep it up!!! I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the show Wahlburgers, and was hoping that my travels would take me to a place that would have a restaurant.  Wahlburgers is located near Bally's in the Grand Bazaar.  Literally right outside Bally's if you are staying there.  They have indoor and patio seating, and it was a nice enough early evening that it was fine to sit outside.  After a review of the menu, I chose Donnie's Favorite, which is the BBQ Bacon burger (minus the jalapenos).  When I got my order, I have to admit that it was a juicy, flavorful burger.  Just the right size for me in terms of portion.  As a side, I ordered the tater tots, since that's what they talk about on the show all the time.  Good tots, but nothing spectacular.  I should have probably adventured to try the sweet potato tots instead.  If you want some souvenir swag, there's a booth closer to the street that sells hats, shirts, etc.  If I was in Vegas longer, I would have considered going to Wahlburgers again!"}
{"text":"Sat here to have a few drinks before an international flight. The weight staff here seems unorganized and kind of unprofessional. Our waitress was eating food from home on her break at a table right next to us...we waited for ten minutes for another waitress to fill my wine. Okay to sit and wait for your flight especially since at options are limited at the end of Gate F (Terminal 1). Wish the service was a bit more on point."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, was there last week, waited 40 minutes for food, waitress forgot our order, no apology. I'm not sure how they got our credit card because we never got the chance to buy anything. They charged us $4.27, not happy that I had to cancel my credit card."}
{"text":"Great food and service, good atmosphere, consistent design. Decent food pricing for downtown toronto although simple carbonated beverages have a 250% markup!

My only real complaint would be that its overly dedicated to Actor Mark Wahlberg. His face and \"accomplishments\" are plastered all over the place. Comes off as a bit arrogant, but hey when you're Mark, I guess you could whatever you please, heh.

Would def visit again to try the other menu items! Recommend."}
{"text":"Went for the first time. Was seated quickly even though the restaurant was busy. Ordered the burger and fries and they were fantastic. The burgers were very juicy, cooked perfectly and the sea salt fries were tasty. Our server Sophie was fast and friendly. The only problem I have was the portion size. The amount of fries you get is about avg with anywhere else however I found the burgers to be rather small and was left hunger after the meal."}
{"text":"Didn't even get a table because the hosts bumped our party of 6 down on wait list after patiently waiting for 30-45 mins. Hosts then had the audacity to tell us we  had to wait another 30 minutes....no thank you we'll go try Ramsey's burgers down the street. Service is King people!"}
{"text":"Yummy but pricey. One double decker burger, one BBQ bacon burger, two sodas, one order of fries and one order of onion rings was $50."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is awful. They are lucky they get the media via the tv show because if they had to rely on the food they'd be out of business. 

Burger was dry, overcooked, and so tiny, all you tasted was the dry bread, not a good thing. The tater tots were so awful tasting, I told the waitress and she apologized and took them off of my bill. The tomato slice was almost as big as my burger and it wasn't thick. Which I suppose is a blessing in disguise, since it was dry as anything and hard to chew and swallow. I ate about half of it because I was hungry, but this was really one of the worst burgers I've ever head. 

The staff was very nice and gracious and even apologized for the fact they refuse to cook the burger less than a very dry medium well.

Bleh. Don't eat here, even a fast food sandwich would be better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get burgers!! I love the Portobello mushroom burger, and the regular burger is amazing. I came here in the afternoon and was surprised at how many seats there were. I was expecting small areas to sit, and not having any room. There was plenty of space to walk around, and the seats were super comfy. I really enjoyed the amazing, hard-working staff. They were super helpful and sweet. My most recomended dish at this fine place would be the onion rings. They don't look normal, but the taste is extrodinary."}
{"text":"Nice new addition to my building!  As the second to review, I'd say the first review was a clear case of \"hating\". Anyone having difficulty with an 18% tip probably should be dining at McDonalds.  I had their \"Our Burger\" and it was perfectly cooked, delicious taste.  Had fries on the side which are shoestring fries.  The fries and the onion rings which should be called onion strings do not come out looking like most people are used to.  However, the taste of both of them are quite good.

No question that the place is more expensive than your average burger joint, but is this really surprising?  You are going to pay $15-20 for a combo at the Priest or 5 guys as well.  In terms of the burgers, The Priest is still better but the feel and decor of Wahlburgers is far and above the competition.  I'd recommend getting the sample sliders so you can sample the different burgers.  Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at the Toronto Airport.  Delicious juicy burgers and fries.  Great selection of local beers.  This was a real find and the Manager, Herman made sure that all the food for my daughter was peanut free.  The service from Wendy was outstanding--A great find!"}
{"text":"As a foodie, I like to try new places when I'm on vacation.  With a recommendation from my neighbor, he gave high praises and said that we have to go to Wahlburgers while we're in Vegas.

I'm a little shy about trying a celebrity joint because it can be \"overrated\" however I will give it a try when it's recommended by a friend.  

There was a short line, hostess said our wait will be 20 minutes or a table for 3.  Well, we got a text within 5 minutes saying our table was ready.  That was quick.

The menu is pretty basic, burgers, fries, tots, pasta and salad.  They have items that they co-created with other celebrities like P-Diddy (Aqua Hydrate).  I ordered that and it taste like water!

We all ordered the same burger - The \"Our Burger\" with the fixings that we wanted and we all agreed that it was really good and exceeded our expectation.  Hubby ordered regulars fries and he said it was ok, I got the tots extra crispy and I liked it, our friend onion strings and she really liked it but it taste better when it first comes out hot.  

Your burger is cooked to order so sit there and have a good ole' conversation with your peeps and make some memories with selfies while you are there waiting for your food.

I liked that the fountain drinks came with a take home cup with free refills.  They also have desserts but we were stuffed to sample any.

I love burgers and it was cooked perfectly and I normally stay off the strip.  Next visit I will Uber it again to this spot!"}
{"text":"You would think I order a burger called the melt with cheese and it would be on a nice burger bun. Instead it's a patty on stale toast and it just sucks. What a let down. Was looking forward to going here to have a burger for a week! A comment from the waitress that's it's not technically a burger would have helped."}
{"text":"Twice I have been to the restaurant.  The first time I ordered Jenny's chicken burger and the second time I ordered the portobello mushroom burger.  Both times I was very pleased with not only the food but the service.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"When I heard we were getting another burger place in the North Hills I thought we already have enough, so if another one opens it needs to be pretty great.  Unfortunately after trying Walhburgers I feel like they are banking on their celebrity status as the food is just lackluster and overpriced.

I had the Fiesta Burger for dinner with Smoked Bacon Mac'n cheese on the side.  The Mac'n cheese was the star of this meal.  It was delicious, but came in a very small cup so was a bit disappointing.  I expected the side to be a bit bigger, maybe even sharable since some of the other sides came in baskets.  The Fiesta Burger was not a fiesta in my mouth, I expected more flavor and spice.  

I honestly wanted to like this place, but left me returning to my usual burger spots.  I wouldn't turn down a cup of that Mac'n cheese though don't even ask me to share it."}
{"text":"I watch the show so I had to try it out. Paul Wahlberg does have a lot to worry about. When you have an absentee owner you do lose a lot of what made you successful in the first place. When the place is about burgers and the chili was the best part you may have to rethink the menu. I really wanted to try Alma's American chop suey but not on menu. Dang! Sorry but this is an over priced Wendy's burgers."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I ended up coming in here on my own so needed a table for one. They have the convenience of being able to order in and not have wait service. You can also do take-out or come in for full-service restaurant.  A burger and fry cost me $15 with tax. Food was good and the portion sizes were  fair but bordered on small. Seats are comfortable and spacious. bright atmosphere. The waitstaff did not appear too overly enjoy their job. I was greeted at the front door and given instructions on how to proceed. That was good although I was not made to feel overly welcome as if they were excited to see a customer walk to the door. I would come back for sure but would not rush to recommend."}
{"text":"Burger spot. No just kidding, it's a burger spot. But it is well known. Good thing is there are some good burgers here. The sizes of the burgers are perfect. My wife and I ate at the exterior bar. This is why they are receiving 3 stars. It was hot the day we went and over the bar there aren't any fans. I can't knock whoever built the place, because they may not have known that the area in downtown isn't the most windy. They're on Ontario, prospect is basically the wind tunnel. 

The interior is bright. The indoor bar is large with plenty of tables to seat plenty of hungry individuals. The wait time when we went was no existent. Around the interior there are plenty of posters, all wahlburg branded of course. Movie posters for Mark, you know. It's right under the jack so you can either enter or exit right from an elevator straight from the jack.

With that out of the way, let's speak on service and food. Our bartender was delightful. She understood the heat and gave us water without us even saying anything. She was thorough and attentive. Walburgers has a simple menu, not too large or small. This is a good thing. The negative is that fries are not a standard side. They make up by having large sides that you purchase separately that can be shared between two people. That's what my wife and I did. We ordered our 2 burgers and split their crispy onion rings, which were a HUGE helping for the price. Speaking on the onion \"rings\" they weren't rings, they were more like crispy shreds. They breading on them was delicious though. I'd never thought I'd like onion shreds outside of a burger but they were definitely done right. This is once again where the bartender came in and helped, we both ordered the onion rings, she quickly told us that we'd definitely only need one serving as it ended up being a large basket. I'd even say 3 people could share them if they get larger burgers. 

As for the burgers themselves. They're definitely flavorful. I ordered the double decker. Which is a classic burger, the veggies were crisp and fresh, the bun was delicious. I haven't seen others reviews or why wahlburgers is getting a bad rap unless it's because of the outdoor bar. The food is good , I've had better burgers elsewhere, but these burgers definitely lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Wow.  Service was rough.  Took a very long time to get an order loaded for soda and then another wait to get a food order in.   Atmosphere was loud, floor was sticky and area was cramped.   The food was good, but not a place I was impressed.   Probably not a place I would try again."}
{"text":"This place is SO good!!! Literally ate here twice during my 3 day vegas trip. 
You have to try the thanksgiving sandwich, it is bomb! My only complaint is......WHY DONT YOU HAVE A LOCATION IN SAN DIEGO!!!!"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews , but let me tell you I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and it was amazing! My husband got the beast then ordered one to go. Amazing! Ps you have to try the onion rings."}
{"text":"Wow want an out standing burger that's not the typical in n out come here! The ambiance is casual, which I find more enjoyable on a late night dinner outing. The service was friendly and very prompt. They explained how everything was just how \"momma\" made it. I ordered the ofb I think it was called and it sent my taste buds on a wonderful ride. Next time your looking for something open late and delicious come here."}
{"text":"Okay, I should have posted this along time ago, but I've been really busy moving to another state, I just happen to stop by to see some family/friends in Cleveland.  
        I was expecting better.  Service took too long and ended up with okay burgers, I've had way better burgers. The place wasn't even packed.  We came here around 6pm. They put us outside and there was a lot of big mosquitoes.  It felt like we came during a shift change or something, or just simply came at the wrong time.  We could tell the manager noticed we were waiting for a long time, walked by us and looked our way but didn't say anything.  We came in a group of 10. I don't think I'll be coming back.  Sorry Wahlbergs."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, it seems this place is getting stars for food, but dinged for service.  After  having lunch here, I think they must be talking about some other restaurant.

Came in on a Wednesday just before noon.  Tribe game tonight, so no unusual crowds.  Was immediately seated and treated by a waiter who brought me an ice water with a lemon.  

After seeing me struggling with what burger I wanted, he made some recommendations, one of which was the BBQ bacon burger I had my eye on.  Ordered it with sweet potato tots (looked good in the Yelp pictures, otherwise I never would have ordered them).

After a few minutes, another server came up on one side of my 2 man table and replaced my water with another, with lemon, without me asking.  While I was distracted by this beverage swap out, another server banged the container of tots on the table and set my burger in front of me.  The guy didn't say a word, just dropped the food on the table, turned tail and ran.   Actually startled me!  

With the one exception of 'lack of social skills server man', the overall service was crazy fast.  I think I waited all of 5 minutes from the time I walked in the door to the time I was eating.

Regarding the food, the burger was nicely prepared, toppings were good, but it was way too much bun.  The sweet potato tots, which again I never would have ordered as I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes, were very good.  I did find it a bit odd that I never got silverware, but that seems to be their MO, as it wasn't needed for what I was eating.  

After I was done, I asked my waiter for a side of pickles, as I saw on the menu they were homemade.  He brought me a cup with my check, and I was a bit surprised to find them more like sweet pickles than dill, but good nonetheless.  

I was in and out in 20 minutes, including the time to write this review.  A lesser bun or a bigger burger with this service would have gotten 5 stars.

UPDATE!  After about 15 minutes of leaving the store, my belly began doing flips and my bowels started screaming for relief.  Found a gas station along the road and almost shit my pants waiting for the guy in front of me to finish his business.  Then, I see there is no TP in the stall, so I have to waddle butt cheeks clenched to the women's can and grab some TP.  Return to the mens's room and experience the most explosive diarrhea I've experienced in a long, long time.  I have an iron gut that no normal food can annihilate, but something went horribly wrong here.  Not sure if it was the lemon, pickles, tots, burger or maybe the guac, but this review just went from a 4/5 to a 1."}
{"text":"Was excited to try Wahlburgers.  Poutine was just average but ok.  The burger had no taste and was quite dry.  I would not spend the money to eat here again"}
{"text":"We have been waiting to try this place since last summer! It was epic!!! The Thanksgiving sandwich was awesome!! Our server  Victor was awesome and friendly!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The burger didn't leave me feeling gross after eating it, however I didn't enjoy it. The meat was under seasoned. My server claimed she didn't hear the first order (of the burger). That was forgiven. But then blamed the kitchen for not bringing out a float I ordered. Sad face. The fries were good."}
{"text":"Like a lot of others I really wanted to like this place. Who doesn't love a good burger? There was a small wait when we arrived but the bar was open so we sat there instead. They restraunt layout is strange, you are greeted at the door by someone taking your name but they never mentioned the bar option but we asked and we're alowed through. The place doesn't advertise but they also have take out. 
Our server was great and the food came out quick. I ordered the bbq burger and my husband the thanksgiving sandwich. He loved his but mine was just ok. There wasn't much sauce so I asked for more bbq sauce. It was horrible. Way too much cumin and if you have ever had too much cumin it tastes like b.o. The house made ranch was bad too. The burger was ok but a little dry. 
I just expected more but was sadly let down."}
{"text":"The Our Burger was Ok. I didn't really get a good flavor. Not impressed with the bun. The pasta salad was one of the best I've ever eaten. But,  I went there for a good burger."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to grab lunch.  It was hot out but the wife and I were HANGIN TOUGH. Walburgers definitely had the RIGHT STUFF.  There was even a friendly lady walking around, CLICK CLICK CLICK, taking complimentary photos.  Our COVER GIRL, Amber, was super nice. She offered suggestions and always had a smile on her face.  Well lit, definitely DON'T TURN OUT THE LIGHTS NOW, clean, and ample seating....probably even at 2 IN THE MORNING.  In the SUMMERTIME or winter, whether you're SINGLE or with the one you tell I'll BE LOVING YOU FOREVER Wahlburgers deserves a visit. This occasion only, BE A BLOCKHEAD and stop on in!!!"}
{"text":"A huge hamburger fan as well as Wahlburg fan.. was so excited to visit the new restaurant that opened in the North Hills area of Pittsburgh.   They do not accept reservations so my first trip was on a week day  - hoping to beat the crowd.  It wasn't as bad as I expected.   The area where the restaurant is - the mall has completely been revamped... and guessing this restaurant was opened here to attract more businesses to the local stores/area.  I just found it odd of all places for Walburgs is in the North Hills - not downtown or southside etc.  BUT!!!!  I am all for more jobs and do like to see other areas of the Burg thrive.  There is a small bar (about 10 bar stools) you can grab a drink or eat at.  The dining room consists of tables mostly - only a few booths.   I thought it would be bigger in size but it was just right. There is also an outside balcony with outside seating.  So we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table (Thursday 5 pm).  I expected to wait longer. I like the fact that my table status was sent to me via text msg through yelp! 

Seated at our booth ...  service was good.  We had studied the menu so we knew what we wanted.  I of course wanted to try several menu items.  The mac n cheese with bacon ...$3.50 and worth it but folks its on the borderline of the sharing size.   It was good and very flavorful and no doubt one of our favorite parts of the meal.  The tater tots (regular not yams!) We were excited about this menu item but when they arrived..  they looked like frozen tater tots!?   I could have bought two bags for $3.50 at the grocery store. They were bland and a disappointment.  We tried dipping them into the walburg sauce and that sauce was ok - a bit odd. Seemed like mayonnaise and ketchup? Then the fries.. ok so they weren't fresh cut but were definitely better than the tots.   The onion rings..  we were sold when we saw they were \"house made\"  .. and if you are a lover of onion rings.. its so fun to dip but when these arrived.. they looked like deep fried onions straws that belong on a burger? They were tough to eat and so odd.  I get it.... It's a different twist on the popular fried food - but was also a disappointment.  Basic tossed salad..dressing on the side - ranch - was requested. The salad came and it was accompanied with the ranch dressing but it was already dressed with a vinaigrette dressing?    Ok mis-haps happen. It was obviously someone elses salad.. another server put it back that way or something? It was just odd.   Then the burgers arrived.  I loved mine.  It lived up to my expectations.  The atmosphere was cool but the food was lacking.   My boyfriend was so excited that there were cupcakes on the menu and when we inquired about those.. were told that they didnt have cupcakes but donuts?? Donuts for dessert? Ugh I will pass. 

We had to ask for silverware? Why weren't they on table or provided when we were seated?


It was disappointing.  Myself and my party were not impressed. The prices weren't too bad but it was one thing after the next.

Perhaps the restaurant is just experiencing growing pains."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious! The meat is not like your regular hamburger meat, theirs is nice and tender well cooked how ever you wish to have it. The vegetables are fresh very well cut portions. No grease for the none greasy people. The bun is just perfect, not your regular bun."}
{"text":"Wahlbergs, you need to get on quality control here. 
I came here back in April of 2017 and the food at that time was pretty good and the  service was great. 
This time around (Feb 4, 2018 10pm) oh no.... food was no good. Both times I ordered the Our burger and this time it was no bueno and my tater tots did not taste fresh ...ugh! I actually did not eat all my food. 
I will say service was good but really it's about the food! 
Get it together!"}
{"text":"Went there on New Year's Day 2018. Sat at the bar. It wasn't busy. Ordered the OurBurger, fries, and coffee. The coffee came real quick. The burger and fries took awhile. By the time they came, both the burger and fries were cold. There are few things worse than a cold burger. Fan of the show. Not a fan of the burger joint."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Definitely running on the coat-tails of the family name.  Would not go back... service was so-so, nothing special... I got the \"wahlburger\" and I was extremely disappointed.  Their special sauce was the best part... The burger was ok, but if you're from northeast Ohio, swensons is 100% better...  again, not worth the money... there's probably a better burger joint in your local area."}
{"text":"Ordered med. rare Our Burgers and fries for the wife and I.  We both agree, the burgers were very tasty. The meat was cooked perfectly, vegetables were fresh and crisp, the sauce appears to be fry sauce base. Everything came together for that perfect flavor.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Got sick here both times I tried there about a month ago.  I hope they've improved by now."}
{"text":"Horrible service, portions were super small. Food was decent but I've had better burgers in my life. Don't waste your time with the sloppy joe burger. It came on a piece of plain bread.../ not impressed"}
{"text":"First time here and honestly it was great. Thankfully there wasn't a line and we were seated right away. Shortly after being seated our waiter came over to us and greeted us and took our drink order. I had a spiked strawberry lemonade and it was good. You could actually taste the alcohol in it. Anywho on to the burgers. My boyfriend got Paul's favorite ,I got Donnie's favorite both done medium, and we shared sweet potato tater tots. The burgers were so yummy. The meat is seasoned so well and the buns are nice, fresh, and soft. Paul's favorite is a delicious classic American burger, while Donnie's has bacon, bbq sauce, and avocado spread which pairs nicely with the meat and bacon. Only complaint from me and the reason for giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bacon on my burger was cold and the tater tots were not crunchy. Besides those 2 small minimal details staff was friendly and attentive, food was great, oh and the whal sauce is bomb.com! DEFINITELY will be coming back here and bringing our family!"}
{"text":"Probably the loudest restaurant I have ever been in. A loud nightclub beat droned the entire time we were there. The place was almost at capacity so the voice decibels were high. Add the servers running back and forth and the place felt chaotic.

The service was very good, the burger was over cooked but still good. The bun was kind of smashed in so handling the thing was a challenge. We wandered around to find a fork and knife. 

The Thanksgiving burger was good but small. The initial food came surprisingly fast but the desert grilled fluffanutta took 20 minutes to show up. It was good though.

In other words the food and the server was good and the rest of the experience was not so good."}
{"text":"Their BBQ SAUCE IS LIFE!!!! They should really hype it up more!! Everything was great! The food, the service, the vibe, everything. Reasonably priced. Loved the green souvenir cup, too!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Vegas! Excited to  finally try the burgers. I've been hearing about the restaurant for years on TV. Place is really catching on as we had to wait 45 minutes. Once we got in turns out it was just an ordinary Burger no special flavors. Onion strings were cold and had to send back.  They didn't come back out until the Burgers were gone... little bit of a bummer. We were given a consolation cupcake..... With all of the Fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas little worried about this one."}
{"text":"Omg if you want the best burger you have ever had go here period end of story. There is nothing more that I can say other than its affordable and timely. Service is great as well as atmosphere. Don't even bother trying anyplace else to compare. This place is the only place to get burgers in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"not just hype! We have been waiting for quite some time to visit wahlburgers and we're not disappointed. I tried the Our Burger with jalapeños (fresh kind not canned!!) and grilled onions and was super satisfied. What made the meal was the assorted house made sauces brought out with the food. The hostesses and our waitress were all super friendly. Kind of pricey, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!! Thick patties, love that you don't need a fork & a knife!! They really thought this place through!  I got the OFD burger, delicious! Onion rings were unique, they use red onion, will try the sweet potato TATOR tots next! Kid-friendly joint even with the bar environment! Service was top-notch!! Just go here!! You will discover cute little shops & restaurants harboring around the way-- even found a new ramen spot I wanna try! Will be coming back to Wahlburgers soon!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously bad. Visited on a Saturday at 3:00 pm....waited 45 minutes for a table after watching party after party being seated before us. They claimed it was because we were a party of 5 and couldn't find the space for us. So we laughed after we finally got seated (after a lot of complaining) and they pulled up that extra chair to put at the end of the table. Wow....what a great idea!  When we got our food, they came over and auctioned it off...yelling out the orders and waiting for one of us to claim it. And the burgers were nasty. All completely over cooked and had no flavor.  Wendy's and Five Guys blow this place away. $60 later (only 4 of us ate and we had no alcohol), we vowed never again. Total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"No thank you.  Mark charges you $4 for coke And $5 for \"Yukon\" fries a la carte lmaoo.  Yukon ??? McDonald's fries are 100 times better.  When you eat Yukon mashed potatoes you will know the difference."}
{"text":"My hubby, son and I were so excited to try Wahlburgers while in town and let me tell you it did not disappoint! My son had the double decker burger, my hubby had the fiesta burger and I had the super melt. Everything was so delicious! It was the best melt I've ever had, the mustard sauce gives it such great flavor! The fries were good and the tots were so crispy! The three of us had a great time and enjoyed our meal so much!"}
{"text":"I had to try Wahlburgers! So I got an \"Our Burger\" with Onion Rings (heard these were homemade) instead of the raw onion and added a fried egg and bacon (Right?!) for my side I did the Tots with Chili and cheese (I saw the chili was homemade too and I'm always want to see what somebodies got!). This was a great burger! And the chili was great - you can see the portions were huge. The only draw back was this set me back $30, a little on the pricey side. (Check out the Photos - the Burger Menu and my meal)"}
{"text":"This burger was a big disappointment lots better out there a waste of time and money there was hardly anything that was on the menu that they show on television"}
{"text":"With a big name like these guys have they could serve poor food for a big price and get away with it. But this is LEGIT! One of the best burgers I've had. Came out piping hot with lots of fresh veggies. The burger was juicy and flavorful. The fries and onion strings were so good. Even the drinks and music was good. Our server was wonderful! I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The beast is the best burger I've ever had. 


No competition

Service was great. Good music. The blonde I was with is the devil covered in blonde hairs"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers with yummy crispy homemade onion rings! I got a burger with a fried egg, pea meal bacon, and \"government cheese\" and loved it! Service was great too. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here  since we watch the Wahlbugers on TV. It was pretty good and burger was full of flavor. We also ordered the bacon mac and cheese which was a small portion for high price. The tator-tots were average and nothing special overall it was fine."}
{"text":"So when I chose this place to eat, it was by chance. I didn't know it was Wahlberg owned. With that said, it went ok. Not impressed with the flavor of the meat. The BBQ is neither sweet, tangy or spicy just bland. 

The service however was excellent. The atmosphere is loud but pleasing."}
{"text":"We watch the show and wanted to try it out. The Burgers were good, Yukon fries were good, Mac n cheese was ok.  We came around 1245pm and was a 15-20 minute wait. They texted us when our table was ready.  There are plenty of shops around to look in while you wait.  My only complaint was that it was too loud in there."}
{"text":"Great food loved the Burgers I loved the location also right in the middle of lots of fun stuff to do"}
{"text":"The food was good but the people there are extremely rude. Their \"rules\" change from day to day. The short blonde girl at the door needs an attitude adjustment. I get ur in vegas but theres no need. Plus they proceeded to talk trash on their walkie talkies. I would only order to go if eating there. The environment is unpleasent."}
{"text":"My brother waited 2 years for this and it's totally worth it! My family usually never finishes their food but here we had a clean plate! This place is amazing! They are adventurous in all the ways you'd want with their burgers and love to customize. The HOMEMADE lemonade is also tasty. Despite it being on the Las Vegas strip it was not hard to get a table for 5. The Wahlberg's are doing the most and it's great! (My brother said the only problem with the place is Mark isn't here lol. He's his biggest fan and had wished he would have ran into Marky Mark)"}
{"text":"SO BUMMED! Watched the show and a big fan of the Wahlbergs. I was excited for them to open one In my home town and couldn't wait to try it. First it took 45 minutes to get a table and I say this because when we got seated, every table was EMPTY! Then it took even longer than that to get our food. Unfortunately, more disappointment - the fries tasted like a day old and the burgers had more grease than a bottle of Weston. 4 out of 5 of us had tummy aches immediately after our dinner. And the FINALE - someone came in and was seated right behind us. They were INSTANTLY catered to and had their food about 5 minutes after they sat down. Found out from our waitress that he was the owners son because she apologized \"when it came to tip time\" that the service was not as great due to someone basically more important came in... Yet it was the first day of their soft opening - don't think I'll be back. From the food to service - so bad! #bummed"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. Mom wanted to go for her birthday. Alicia, our waitress, was fabulous. She explained pretty much everything about the menu. Food came nice and hot. Ordered onion rings, recommend getting if going to put on burgers, more for snacking on since they are like shoestring kind. Food was reasonably priced and good. Will return again. Thanks again for the great service."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious, service was fast and friendly, and prices were reasonable! Try the sweet potato tots and The Melt!"}
{"text":"Loved the onion rings! They were thinly sliced red onions lightly dredged in flour and fried crisp. The Wallburger  sauce is tasty too. Good burger with terrific pickles!!"}
{"text":"This is are 2nd visit and we loved it better then the first time. Fresh fresh food. Not greasy. Cooked well and taste great! Clean establishment well organized great communication throughout. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ate here with my co-worker on a busy weekend. 

Service: fast and friendly 

Food: I got a \"BBQ Bacon\" burger, well done (I know I know, but I don't like red meats) with fries and onion rings. Burger was good and the side order of half fries/half onion rings were a lot. Probably could have split it. My co-worker however, got the \"our burger\", medium. The burger came rare. Looked like the beef version of ahi tuna. Couldn't even get through half the burger. He also got half fries and half tater tots which were ok. Sauces are a \"meh\". 

Price: over priced. My one soda, was $4.95. Maybe it's because it came in a souvenir cup (which we had no idea about until the check came). 

I don't think I'd eat here again. And I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers ever! The pickles....so delicious!! The only thing that I didn't like about the place was it was very loud inside so we had to almost yell to talk to each other. Loved the pictures on the wall and our server was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"eh\" Burger ($10.45) which has a 5oz. patty (I upgraded to 8oz!), peameal bacon, fried egg, smoked cheddar, lettuce and ketchup. I also added some wahl sauce. It was a messy burger but it was great. 

I also got the onion rings ($3.50). They were these thin, wispy onion pieces that were covered in batter, didn't really like them and probably wouldn't order them next time.

For seating, there were 2 floors. You can be seated in a portion of the first floor where you can be served or just order to-go/dine-in at the back. 

Overall, the food was good but I think there are better food options in the area."}
{"text":"The food was alright. Service was awful!  We went with family friends and had a black and white with a plastic spoon grinded in it. It's a marketing machine and that's about it. Was very disappointed hope they get this corrected."}
{"text":"Ice cold burgers, clearly precooked food. Staff was inattentive and walking across the street to the other bar--were they on a break? Probably not, floated back and forth to serve customers. 

Onion rings were ice cold and barely edible. Iced tea was more than a day old and not fresh. 

Portobello and burger bun was soggy and showing signs of aging, like a fine aged scotch--not good for buns though. 

Skip here and go to Bobby's Burger Palace."}
{"text":"First timer here. We got burgers,  onion rings, fries and soda. Skip onion rings and fries. Onion rings are sliced paper thin and their yoop hard to eat.   I like thicker onion rings. Fries were boring and dry.  They definitely weren't just made.  The burger was out of this world fantastic.  Fresh!!!!!! I'd go back and order a burger but skip  the sides."}
{"text":"Happy hour is half off drafts and cocktails , very very small menu. Service was good, not great."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The burger we had was amazing! It was their main burger (forgot the name now) we just removed the bacon and added extra mushrooms! Amazing! They have a full bar and their own beers from Vegas here are pretty good. I loved the service. Our waiter was Ashley and she was a doll. Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Donnie.  Your restaurant at Toronto airport  needs serious repair. Your  $9.95 burger was horrible..thin bleak looking burger was completely dry & tastess...the bun fell apart.. The staff seemed new..my waitress actually never tasted the burger...she didnt seem surprised that I asked for my money back. You seem to take pride in serving processed govt cheese cause your family grew up eating that. Do you think it is cool 40 years later to slap a thin slice of tasteless cheese in your  $9.95 burger? And that was the cheapest bun on the menu...going up to 12.95..really? With no sides..all extra. Ouch!!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. 

If you're a local, definitely better spots than this and not worth heading to the strip.

Burgers were well cooked to order (medium well is what I had and was right on) but forgetful.

Onion rings were good, but greasy.
Tots were ok.
Shakes were good. 

The ranch was delicious! they add some type of herb to give it an extra flavor explosion.

I guess this place is fun if you're a fan of the show...

Pass. 
Try instead: Bachi Burher, Gordon Ramsay burgr, or even Shake shack."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful establishment that the 3 brothers built together. I am from Los Angeles  so I can't wait for it to be open down there. My food was very delicious and the service was great. Thanks Wahlburgers!!!"}
{"text":"I want a refund! $120, family of 4. - Y'all should be ashamed if that's what you are serving folks. We love the show - not your restaurant in Vegas! I read another review it was hilarious the guy said the quality control was left in Boston - it wouldn't even matter - I'll never walk into another location. The Mac n' Cheese very sad! My husband and kids could not even find the cheese. I had the OFD the part that actually had sauce wasn't that bad. The fries and tater tots were brought cold, hard and crunchy, they did bring more same result. The Frappes were good extremely over priced! So disappointed, my son said Burger King would have been better! My husband and oldest were hungry as we left, so we had to stop and get pizza! Worst money spent this year!"}
{"text":"Seated with a larger group right away on a Saturday in a nice spot on their spacious patio. 

I got the fiesta burger and it was delicious! Only complaint would be all the sauce is laid on the bottom bun, so the burger gets a little soggy and may fall apart. Our table also got onion straws/rings to share and they were incredible, gone in probably 5 min. 

The food was excellent for everyone, HOWEVER, can't see myself wanting to go back due to service. Our waiter was awful. Silence when we ordered, never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked. That was the most surprising. Wait for our food was pretty lengthy but not crazy. 

I've heard the same thing over and over again about this place \"food is good, service is terrible\"."}
{"text":"Just attempted to eat a double. 5 lb burger at Whalburgers and to my horror i received a burger with two patties the size of a quarter.  Sent entire meal back. I suggest you buy a burger at McDonald's to see what a 1/4 lb of meet looks like. Don't even waste your time eating here. No stars for this pathetic establishment."}
{"text":"So I am a huge New Kids fan and was super excited to drive the hour up from Buffalo, NY to go to this in Toronto. We walk in, there are three very young teenage girls just standing by the hostess stand. I look at them and say, we have two can we get a table. \"Oh sit anywhere.\" Okay that's the first mistake because now they are not evenly placing people to the waiters' tables, and now the waiter has no idea that we are his table. After ten minutes of just sitting at the table, we ask a hostess if we could get our order taken and she finds us a waiter; who again probably did not know we were his table. After about 35 minutes our burgers and tots arrive; why such a long wait, it wasn't packed in there. Every so often I would look around at the staff, two bartenders? On a Thursday? They looked bored out of their minds. Why three hostesses? And they would all stand together and just talk, about six or seven of the staff would just stand around and do nothing but chat. Where's the management? Also, the girls' uniforms? Seriously? If the skirts were one inch shorter I could tell if they had bikini waxes, as a woman, I am disgusted. So the food arrives, my bf orders his medium rare. His is over well done; sends it back. Within two minutes he has a replacement, again over well done. Finally, what appears to be the manager comes over and explains that in Canada the meat needs to be cooked a certain way and has to be frozen first. The burgers were gross. I had lumpy things in mine and kept having to spit it up. Also, the menu lists the cheese as \"government cheese.\" What the hell is this? Are we welfare recipients? I want Swiss or Chedder on my burger, not government cheese. Is this only like this in Canada, is the Boston Wahlburgers different? So the Manager at least comps by bf's burger, now he is starving after having been in this establishment for almost an hour. The regular tater tots were too salty for me to eat and the sweet potato ones tasted funny, maybe it was the oil they used. I don't know, it was just a very disappointing meal and still cost over $20 even with the comp'd burger. Never again will I go here. Terrible service and terrible food."}
{"text":"Burgers are great!! Customer service could have been faster and more interactive but that's still a 5 star place"}
{"text":"We had a great visit to Wahlburgers today. It was pretty crowded and a little noisy as my friends met right at lunch time. It was our first time there. The place looked clean and nicely decorated. Jill our waitress was energetic and polite and stopped by often. We ordered the onion rings basket which was yummy. This was my first time eating such thin cut onions, but they were good. I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich which I enjoyed . The price was reasonable and I would come again. It is a nice addition to the Mccandless area ! By the way, you can enter the restaurant from either the McKnight road side or the back side. They did a great job renovating the old Northway mall with a beautiful stairwell. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Very good service and food! Paul. Aka JR was so amazing. He was always rounding to make sure we were taken care of. Always had a smile on his face. He deserves a raise for all the hard work he does!Great atmosphere and music. Great drinks. Come here if you want some good food and bar service!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! I dont watch this show and honestly find the Wahlbergs pretty annoying. That aside, the food was great and the service was above average. We went on a crowded day during the middle of the lunch rush. We were seated quickly and drink orders taken immediately. Food took awhile but as I said they were super busy. When the food arrived it was excellent. Burger was delicious and the onion ring/straws were absolutely amazing. I still wont watch the show, but Ill eat there again in a second."}
{"text":"I would describe this place as upscale fast food. The food comes out in disposable containers or baskets and the drinks were served in to go cups.  If you order a soda or shake it comes in a plastic cup that you keep.  This is smart on their part because I saw a lot of people with that green cup all over the area. Good advertising. They get 4 stars because they didn't \"wow\" me. It's descent food at an expectable price."}
{"text":"1/2 pound is really more like 1/4 pound, otherwise they are ok. Service is reasonable. Frys are decent if not the best."}
{"text":"Sorry, but for a $12.00 and over burger, you better step your game up, and this place didn't.  Ordered the double patty \"Wahl\" burger and the bun was cold and very dry.  The meat was also just okay.  There was nothing special about it.  It wasnt juicy, it wasnt flavorful.  People talking about this is the best lol wow you obviously havn't been to a real burger joint.  Try Burger Boss or maybe even the Habit.  

Then when it came time to pay, we asked for split checks and the waiter responded by saying they couldn't, because we didn't ask for it at the beginning.  Seriously?  We didn't know that.  The waiter also  automatically added an 18% gratuity for a party of 7.  I'm sorry, but bringing out fast food (not heavy dinner plates) does not constitute an 18% tip.  Especially when you're buddies in the back are the ones bringing it out.  

Place is definitely not recommended.  Read the reviews people."}
{"text":"I don't know why but I didn't have high expectations coming into this place.  I'm glad to say that it definitely proved me wrong.  I ended up getting the fiesta burger with sweet potato tater tots.  The burger was seriously delicious.  It was a bit spicy, just the way I like it.  The tots were perfectly cooked and they give you a solid portion.  Overall, this place has great food at a good value and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My only experience at wahlburgers sucked. We had a party of 4 and 2 kids. Of course my kids made a mess 2 seconds in the restaurant and the waiter was really nice about it and cleaned it up quick. My husband and I were so excited to try the burgers because we do watch the show! I asked for medium well for my burger and when I got it it was pink but looked past that and all order of fries were cold so we asked for fresh ones. not once did the waiter tell us the fries or any side orders were extra charge. So we finish eating and our bill comes up to be almost $80 for 2 burgers and a kids meal. And we saw they charges $15 for fries. My husband asked to speak with a manager and all she said was that Fries are an extra charge and doesn't come with our $13 burger. We refused to pay for the fries and she had to get her manager and he said the same. No apologies no nothing. We were there for about 20 min going back and fourth about the charge for the fries and they end up taking 1 Fries charge off. Still refusing to pay the manager comes back with SECURITY and a new bill with all Fries off our bill. There was no need for security when he didn't show us the last bill before he called security. The management sucked the waiter was extremely nice but could have let us know side orders are extra. Overall everything on the strip is overpriced period. But my burger was pink when I asked for medium well and they are overpriced. My Fries were cold and tasted as they've been sitting out for a while. Fries are overpriced for a small container. Fountain drinks are almost $4 so they are overpriced. Save your money save your time as well."}
{"text":"Yes! Finally it's here. Reminds me of home, East Coast. Being from NY, we would go to MA just for these burgers. No joke. Check them out, you won't be disappointed. 

Vegas location is a different story ... hopefully they'll get better with time."}
{"text":"I had a great time here. We grabbed some drinks and hit the town. I loved the ambiance and the service was on point. I had fun! Thanks for the memories Patty!"}
{"text":"This place feels and looks really cute and homey inside with all of the pictures of mark walberg and his family, along with their story on the wall. The burger was pretty good!! I would say I thought it was a bit pricey for the tiny burger I got, it doesn't even come with fries. We also got a strawberry lemonade that I thought was terrible, but it was $13 lol. Worth trying, I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing burger and the tots are a must try. We also tried the skinny onion crisps, but those you can pass on.
The Wahlburgers beer was a nice touch and a pint of it fits perfectly with any burger!"}
{"text":"A big fan of the Wahlbergs and watched the show faithfully, so needless to say I was excited to visit the restaurant.  I was initially put off when our waitress at the bar was so dismissive and super unfriendly.  Being our first visit, when we asked questions, she was very short and only gave yes no answers, didn't make recommendations or offer up anything. All the time were speaking to her, she was looking around and doing other things totally seemed uninterested in providing us any type of service.

I ordered the BBQ Bacon burger with BBQ sauce on the side, fries and a drink. My friend ordered The Our Burger with bbq sauce and Tater Tots, specifically asked for lettuce and tomato. She took our order and immediately walked away. She didn't ask if that completed our order or anything, when in fact my friend wanted a drink. While we were waiting on our order another nicer friendlier waitress came along and asked if we wanted a drink or water while we waited. 

Our order comes and my BBQ Bacon burger was a bun, with patty and 2 jalapenos. The burger was supposed to have bacon, cheese, avocado spread and bbq sauce. I sent it back. It came back with more jalapenos only. I sent it back again and told them to completely do it over. 

My friend's burger came out with meat, bun and signature wahl sauce. It WAS supposed to have lettuce, tomato (I mentioned earlier that she specifically requested lettuce and tomato), \"government\" cheese and housemade pickles. She also sent her burger back. She got the burger back, still no BBQ. She asked for BBQ and the 1st waitress brought her clearly what was ketchup in a cup. When we told her that is ketchup, she proceed to argue with us and tell us that \"this is ketchup (pointing to the bottle), we don't have ketchup in the cup only bbq sauce!\" We sat the ketchup she gave us and the BBQ sauce that came with my burger side by side to show her the differences that one could clearly. This waitress had the never to say, we make it homemade, so it a bit sweeter today. Seriously! As this conversation is going on I see what appears to be a manager and tell him about the service and the ketchup issue, he apologizes and keeps it pushing. What has happened to customer service?

A gentleman sitting near us ordered the sloppy joe with no onion strings...his sandwich came piled so high with onion strings it was incredible. He was so disgusted and kept shaking his head the entire time he pulled all those onion strings off. They offered to make him another one, he said never mind because it had taken so long to receive the messed up one. 

Once we finally got our burgers right, they were very good, but the service left us unimpressed and not wanting to return or recommend. Just think this place has only been open for 6 weeks. This type of service usually doesn't happen this early in the game. I told my friend, the Walhbergs need to do a drop in on this place as the staff here is ruining the brand."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes to get in tonight for this place. Seems like a good place to hang when you watch on tv but not so much. Once I'm finally sat at the bar it was another 15 minutes sitting there with no one acknowledgeding me at all This is the 2ns time this place has made a horrible impression on me  Stop worrying about the tv shows and get back to the people. 2 thumbs down boys!"}
{"text":"The music is loud. The food is average. And Wahlburger's I hope you recycle EVERYTHING comes in plastic, paper or styrofoam.  Still you love Marky Mark."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I really enjoyed it. We did have to wait about a half hour for a seat, which originally annoyed me. But once we were seated and the food started coming I got over it in a hurry.

I ordered the OFD burger and it was spectacular. I had it prepared medium and it was exactly that . It was flavorful  and the toppings were fresh and tasty. I also had a side of onion rings and they were more than one person could eat.

One of my companions ordered the macaroni and cheese and it made me wish I had ordered some for myself, despite the fact that I'm pretty picky about mac and cheese. This was definitely a winner. My companion also have the sloppy joe and said it was very good.

Service was great, albeit a little slow. I track that up to the fact that all of the food was fresh and well prepared.

I travel to Las Vegas once a year, and I will return to have another Burger next year!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! Was looking for Mark, but he wasn't in the house. I got the Our burger, it was really good, meat was juicy. Got a side of addicting onion rings, so good. Cool hamburger spot on the strip."}
{"text":"It was fine. The burgers were pretty dry and they seemed to need more condiments (and spread out, not just a dollop in the middle like these were), the bread was dry, and the meat was dry. The tator tots were crispy but not tasty. The chili was also on the very meaty-ground beef side of the chili spectrum, so FYI for those who prefer soupy-beany chili instead. I would eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way or anything."}
{"text":"We went there last night. Best burger in town! Loved the flavor of the meat. The pickles are homemade and are yummy! The fries are great and we loved the chili. The soft drinks are a bit pricey. Good experience and all employees were very friendly and helpful. We will be back."}
{"text":"Burgers were great and made to over. Meat was very flavorful and homemade sauces were the perfect flavor to add. Sides were generous portions and complimented the meal well! Large selection of hand crafted cocktails to chose from and big beer selection!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how you make a burger taste like nothing. I don't mean lack of seasoning, but nothing. Not beef. Not meat. It was like chewing on a dry, flavorless disk of sadness and broken promises. I've had better dining experiences at a high school football game. Service was pretty good. Friendly. Attentive. Food needs some work."}
{"text":"The food was ok.... Ordered fries and tots both were cold and came in a small styrofoam cup which I paid $5 each for.... Burger was eh.... I've had better.... Service was good and staff was friendly.... I won't be coming back here, waste of money......should be half the price of what they charge..."}
{"text":"Booooooooo!
Hissssssss booooooo!

Ok can only speak for the our burger - which is an embarrassment.    How dare you make a greasy mess of a simple backyard burger? Wtf - it's like I'm a mega foodie ok? And you sent me to McDonald's to get the best burger.   $.79 worth.   For $10 this medium cooked burger patty may have been pre cooked-  because it came to my table cold.   Cold.   Ice cold. And the place was not even busy - paul please just call me.    773-398-8417

Alma's Mac salad was ok but would t kill you to add salt pepper and maybe just a little garlic? 

The fries were cold and hard and when I asked for some fresh hot ones he came by Lickety split with a fresh batch of cold hard fries in styrofoam cup.    Booooo again boooo I say!!!!!!!

Oh dear walburgers, please come to my backyard and see what really should be on your menu.   


Ps writing this made my Midwest heart hurt so so sad.   I wanted it to be sooooo goooood.    Is there anything jenny can do or are we destined for crappy east coast  burgers???"}
{"text":"We only waited 13 minutes AFTER we were seated for someone to come to our table. 20 minutes AFTER ordering, I was told they were out of onion rings. 40 minutes AFTER ordering, we were told they were out of mac and cheese for our 2 kids. I had high expectations that were crushed. There are way better burgers elsewhere in the North Hills."}
{"text":"The burger was the best I've had in quite a while. That being said, extremely overpriced when the meal comes with a very small portioned burger and nothing else. Fries cost extra. Nice selection of drinks and speedy service."}
{"text":"Being a local I always call ahead to restaurants especially since I have a family and I want to know how busy it is. We love taking our kids out to new restaurants, but kids in the heat on the strip is really iffy, so you have to choose a restaurant wisely. When we heard that Wahlburgers  was finally open of course we wanted to go down and check it out. They have only been open for 3 days so we called ahead of time and nobody answered the phone, so we just assumed they were busy and that we would just wait and walk around a little bit. Well we get down there 45 minute wait after we just drove 35 minutes to get there. So we're tad bit upset, but there's little shops to go to so it is what it is. The lady at the front who looks so confused by the way tells me to give them my phone number and they'll text me when they're ready. She tells me again it's a 45 minutes wait I don't get a text until an hour and 45 minutes later now at this point I have already gave my kids all their snacks and all 36ozs of water each. So we go inside notice tons of open tablesWe order and wait 25 plus minutes for a kids hamburger, cheese burger sweet potato tots Paul's favorite and the mushroom one with onion strings and fries. The sweet potato tots or disgusting my kids didn't even eat them also my kids hamburgers were burnt my mushroom burger was burnt when I asked for medium and Paul's favorite was crap. What is up with that? This is Las Vegas step it up or step out! Won't be going back and I work in the industry and people always ask me where to go to eat... Wahlburgers isn't on that list! Well on the list to avoid."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger, but I'm not a burger connoisseur. The tots and onion rings were good. I'd like to go back and try the fries. 

This is just a burger joint. Don't expect a huge menu with a lot of options, especially vegetarian."}
{"text":"If you can find the restaurant hidden in the back of the block \"mall\", it's pretty good! We really enjoyed their burgers. They even make their own ranch and have vegetarian burgers. Totally worth it if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"If you want a completely underwhelming burger experience then Wahlburgers is just the spot. Have been to the YYZ Wahlburgers twice due to delayed flights and the second visit was worse than the first. 

Had the Our Burger both times. 

Visit 1: food took 45 mins. I had the time given delayed flight so didn't push and waited to see how long. Burger finally arrived and it looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for the 45 mins. Sloppily put together as well like a 5 year old was assembling this basic burger. Tasted like a cheap burger not a $10 burger. FYI fries or onion rings are extra.  

Visit 2: burger arrived without delay. However presentation was again like a 5 year old works in the kitchen. The 2 crappy pickles were hanging outside the bun and the sauce was all over the place. The tomatoes were missing completely. Onion rings were terrible and do not recommend. 

Candidly I have had better food at Wendy's for less but when stuck at the airport best to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Waited forever for a server, while waiting got a first hand view of the dysfunctional employee culture.  Watch staff, fight, argue and be all around rude to each other.  Bar tender handled garbage then went back to making drinks, no hand-washing anywhere.   Once I ordered, waited more than 45 minutes for a burger.  Do yourself a favor- go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to a Wahlburgers.  See my review of the original location in Hingham in April 2017.  Much better food and service this time.  Their customer service reached out to me and asked me to try again.  Onion rings are as tasty as I remembered.  This time the service was efficient and friendly.  Our food arrived hot and not soggy.  Both the melt and the original burger were very good.  Would definitely go back, good service makes a difference!"}
{"text":"Omg.   They should stick to acting.   Absolutely awful.   I'm no a picky eater but it sucked.    Onion rings???    Is that what those were ?       The ranch dressing was so overwhelming with oregano that I couldn't eat it.   Never again thanks"}
{"text":"Over-priced and underwhelming. The burger was over done. Attached is the bill. $40 CAD for 2 burgers and French fries and tater tots and 2 cokes.  Will not go here again.  Not impressed. Price gauging. Save your money and go somewhere else.
Burger $9.95 CAD with fries $3.50 CAD!  Crazy!!'"}
{"text":"Greattt burgersss! Love it, every time I'm in Vegas it's a must. Love the cups we get to keep as souvenirs!"}
{"text":"We gave Wahlburgers another visit and it was PERFECT. A great atmosphere, a great burger and great service!!!! A must stop if you go to Vegas"}
{"text":"A bunch of good and a little bit of so-so.  
Stopped in and the place was pretty packed I was greeted by a friendly staff and surprisingly seated right away. 

I couldn't have asked for a better server. Anthony was amazing. Great personality, very helpful with menu recommendations.   While I watched other tables looking around, trying the get their servers attention, Anthony checked on us often. 

The bathrooms were a bit in bad shape. Water and toilet paper was all over the floor and it looked as no employees had checked on it for quite some time. 

I got the Melt which was amazing. Highly recommended.  Paired that up with the onion straws that were great. The portion was very large 

It's a good addition to downtown as there really is no true burger joint in the area. 

I'm looking fwd to trying some other menu items and giving the patio a shot."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to going here for a very long time.  Got there and the place was cool and staff friendly for the most part.  But that was the best part of it.  I was there with a friend.  Our food was not good.  Our burgers did not taste good.  They were devoid of flavor.  The lettuce was wilting and dead.  The waitress Ana, was not very attentive.  We had to flag down 2 others to help us.  My friend was offered a different item off the menu.  She tried a salad.  That lettuce was not fresh either.  All in all, very disappointing experience.  Burgers not good.  Salad not good.  Waitress not good."}
{"text":"I went here just to say I tried it but the truth is I wasn't too impressed. The food was pricy, the establishment was snobby and post eating both my husband and my stomach's hurt (ordered burger medium well).

The food itself was good, but I can't say it was the best I ever had especially for the price of the burger/sandwich or whatever you want to call it.  We both tried The Melt (2 @ $12.95,ordered one fry-$4.95, and one strawberry frappe-$7.95. The total was $40! 

I enjoyed the homemade pickles very much and the strawberry frappe was pretty good. 

I say the establishment is snobby because they made us wait 5 minutes to order to-go outside in the cold when the restaurant was at what looked to me like 80% capacity at 8pm on a Tuesday. The bar wasn't full, and a couple tables were clearing up. Then it took another 15 minutes for our to-go food to actually be ready. Other customers also had to wait outside in 40° for about 15-30 minutes because that's how long the wait to dine in was. 

I didn't anticipate the prices being so high. Menus online showed lower pricing and after wasting time waiting to order I felt obligated to just pay it since my husband and I had been walking the strip for a while looking for something to it. 

Cool to say I went. Love Mark Wahlburg. Didn't love my experience at Wahlburgers."}
{"text":"You can tell this place is good because of how busy it is, but we were pleasantly surprised with how quick it was! It is a little tricky to find, but well worth the walk. Burgers were exceptional and the chicken sandwich was amazing!  Don't even get me started on how great the onion rings were! There were no Wahlberg sightings when we went but that won't discourage us from returning!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS BURGER!!!! We stopped in to give this place a shot.  We sat at the bar and we ordered the HEARTY and sweet potato tots.  The hearty was cooked perfectly delicious everything and I just loved loved the pickles.  I can understand why they have a burger joint it's really good.   Even better that it was enclosed and it was a cold night in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Probably the best meal and drink I had while in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Totally needed to have some comfort food - after a crazy night out before a flight out. I had the mushroom burger and needless to say, it was slamming! this is going to be my place to go every time I fly out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience!  My family and I decided to give Wahlburgers a try this weekend, and were very pleased with both the service, and the quality of our food.  We were seated immediately, and greeted promptly by our server, Russell, who was super helpful, and friendly.  After some debate, we wound up going with the Melt, Mom's Sloppy Joe, Jenn's Chicken Sandwich, and a children's entree.  We also ordered the sweet potato tots, onion rings, and the mac and cheese with smoked bacon.  Our food came within twenty mins, and each entree / item was better than the next, although, I personally had the seared chicken sandwich, which I highly recommend.  The smoked mac and cheese was amazing, as well.  

So glad to have another family friendly, affordable, delicious dining option in the area, and look forward to a return visit to Wahlburger's soon!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, but the food was a let down.  For the amount paid for the burgers fries should have been included.  The fries were definitely not freshly cooked.  The chicken tenders had no flavor. The margarita was super sweet, which a margarita shouldn't be sweet.  Also it didn't taste like there was much alcohol in it."}
{"text":"We had the Portabello burger, which was very good and the Our Burger, which was okay. Nothing special. Two burgers, fries and two beers with tip was $54. I guess I can say we've been there done that now...."}
{"text":"Meh. Appear to be surviving on namesake. Wasn't bad.. but certainly not wait in line good ... don't waste your time on the wahlbrew it's horrible"}
{"text":"I guess I'm the exception to many of my Yelper friends.  I really liked Wahlburger.  Maybe they are getting their act together, or it was just timing.  We had to wait only a few minutes, since we're early dinners.  We went at 6pm on a Wednesday night.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  It is, by the way, a burger joint, so I ordered the \"BBQ Bacon\" burger and my wife ordered \"The Our Burger\".  We both thought they were really tasty.  if you call yourself a burger joint, the burgers should be good, and they were.  The waiter recommended the sweet potato tots.  We really enjoyed those.  They are sweet and have a pretty interesting texture.  The best I could describe them would be hash brown balls, but sweet.  I couldn't stop eating them.  The only complaint I have is the cost.  However, I've been complaining about the cost of food in Vegas since we got here.  It's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Dropped by shortly after opening. Burger was good... tater tots and thinly sliced onion rings were great. They forgot my request for jalapeños. At the price point it doesn't feel like great value."}
{"text":"I heard nothing but great things about this, I was so disappointed! I had the chicken tenders and they were dry and cold, my daughter had the grilled cheese and bacon with very few fries and her food was cold. The only thing that was good was the service."}
{"text":"This place must be hit or miss.
Service is what I'd expect for where the location is. Which is not terrible but also not friendly or attentive.
Prices are ridiculous and really not worth what you get. For 4 people we paid $85 because each burger is 11-15 dollars AND THAT'S JUST THE BURGER. $5 for friends (and any other side) is just ridiculous. Especially because the fries come out cold and soggy. Really unreasonable and over priced for the low quality tastelessness.
I got a melt with my friend and it was perfect. I have no complaints and neither did she. Cooked perfectly. Seasoned beautifully. Just the taste and the juiciness, so awesome. I would splurge just to get that again (with no side)
However the other two guests I was with hated their burgers. They weren't as juicy and it was comparable to a fast food burger. I don't remember the exact title but one of them got a BBQ burger that had Bleu cheese sauce. And one got some Latin inspired one with heat and spice. I tried both and I wasn't impressed. When we gave them a taste of our melts, they were envious! We also had sweet potato tots which were very awkward and tastless.
Overall, the melt is the only thing I enjoyed. I can't get over how much the sides are. You'd think with $12 burgers they would come with fries. Nope!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious yummy food!"}
{"text":"There food is very good. The service could get better, but overall it was good. Their chicken sandwich is the most amazing sandwich I have ever had in my life. It took them quite some time to get the food and they're a little pricy. Wouldn't  be my first choice but it was good."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this restaurant was mark Wahlberg's name. Food quality was poor and the price for this fast food hamburger was outrageous. Several other burger places nearby that are WAY better and more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"came here to grab a bite to eat with my girl from the states.. as per my request.

1) we waited at the front for a good while before we got dismissed to the back - we weren't asked if we were dining in or taking out... we wanted to sit and eat. we go to the back and get redirected to the front.

2) almost slipped and fell because the floors weren't clean... i was told to watch where i'm walking 

3) we ordered an alcoholic milkshake and we're asked not to see our ID's but rather \"are you old enough for this?!\" i'm sure i'm older than the server was.

4) ordered the mushroom burger only to have her walk away with a look of disgust.

5) we had to ask for the bill 4 times before it was brought over - the place was empty.

6) i'm not returning to this location."}
{"text":"I am alone in Las Vegas at a conference. This is the one place that I walked into and was immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. There were no seats at the bar, so she sat me at a booth. The server immediately got my drink order and food order. The whole staff is super friendly and welcoming. I am definitely coming back! The food was amazing. I got the sloppy joe and sweet potato tots. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, but food was okay. I ordered the lobster burger and the burger was just lacking alot of flavor and the portion sizes were not that large as well.
Nothing spectacular for the price."}
{"text":"We have been waiting to try this place for months as it finally opened in Vegas where we visit a couple times a year. To sum up the experience, I ordered the BBQ \"Bacon\" burger, which came to the table without bacon. The burger was like warm at best. We ordered the Mac N Cheese. It was watery and lacked flavor. The fries were warm as well as the tater tots. I gave it a two star rating instead of a one because the overall the burgers were great tasting, if only brought to the table with a little more temperature. We came in the middle of lunch where one would think the food, including the fried food, would be cooked to order. It didn't seem like like in this case. Maybe Paul needs to do a quality control visit and get the cooks and servers in line."}
{"text":"I tried Wahlburgers over the weekend while I was in Vegas. I ordered the BBQ bacon burger complete with avocado, cheese, barbecue sauce and bacon. The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The service was excellent. The only thing that would have made my meal better is if the fries were actually seasoned. I'd recommend ordering the tater tots or a different side."}
{"text":"All and all it was good.  I had the Cod Fish and Onion Strings.  It was crowded so we had to sit at the bar.  I would have preferred a booth. Stuff happens and I guess being too crowded is a good thing if its your business:)"}
{"text":"Wanted a great burger, been in the mood for one, and still gonna have to go somewhere else to find one....The service from the hostess as well as the server were great...friendly and all. Hot dog with sour kraut, really good...but the onion rings, although huge portion, tasted like bland grease. The burger was about the same...no flavor, just not good at all! Even the coffee was just super strong, tasted old....this was a huge miss!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I'm walking out of the restaurant writing this review. The burgers are small for the price. We sent back the Mac n Cheese 3 times. It came to us cold, with no cheese. Then Luke warm, then just warm. Never hot. And it was in a small foam cup. Everything there is in small portions and over priced, with cheap utensils. You get plastic forks, cups that look like they're from In n Out and the meal in foam cups. What?! I do not suggest this place at all. I could have went to Walmart and bought everything to make the meal, including utensils, for less. The Mac n Cheese by the way is penne noodles with cold cheese. A coke in a med size cup was $3.95"}
{"text":"The burger was better than i expected, the tater tots were flavorless and cold, the fries were a disappointment.(taste like frozen). The atmosphere was cool. A server or whoever she was waking around taking pictures super aggressive rude and pushy. No means no i dont want your $25 4X6 pic. Other than that I'd go again."}
{"text":"Burgers are awsome! Service sucks if service would have been better I'll give a 5 star rating, definitely coming back, I hope I get a better service next time"}
{"text":"Yeah... I don't hand out 1's and 2's all that often but I was kinda torn as to what to rate the Terminal 1 Wahlburgers and the description on Yelp for 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\", and I think that's fair to say.

I was super excited to eat here, especially with all the hype and the cool branding and the reality tv! But alas, Meh prevails.

Let's not even talk about the service, I feel like everyone who works food service at the airport has the personality of wax paper, and the amount of language barriers is actually a little frustrating when you're on a tight timeline and need to eat quick. I'm sure they're all nice folks but come on, it's a fun place... SMILE!

Food wise I went with the BBQ Bacon Burger and upsized it to a 8 oz patty. It was overcooked, dry, not really hot - my bet it was mostly cooked and warmed up upon order. The impressive list of toppings that came standard really could do much to help it.

I'll give it another go next time, or maybe check a stand-alone location to see if it's any better butttttt for now, this spot hit a Wahl for me...

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"On my quest to find the best burger in all of Cleveland, Wahlburgers really made things complicated. Honestly I went in not expecting much, but their Fiesta Burger immediately jumped to the top 4 best burgers I've had I'm Cleveland so far. Thick and juicy patty with great seasoning, fresh and flavorful toppings all added up to a solid burger.

The sweet potato tots were just eh to me but if they cooked them a little crispier i could really get down with them. Good job Marky Marky"}
{"text":"I have been very disappointed by this burger joint. I had the Thanksgiving Turkey Burger. Absolutely tasteless! Do yourself a favour and avoid this place. Instead walk a few blocks from there on Adelaide near Simcoe to The Burger's Priest for outstanding burgers."}
{"text":"My wife loves the show so we went by Wahlburgers Las Vegas for an afternoon snack. The one star is for it server. She was great. Everything else was terrible. $90 for six people. Two split hamburgers and a couple of kids meals. Fountain drinks are $5. That's ridiculous, even for Vegas. Onion rings are actually onion strings. Mostly breading and grease. No actual onions. Three of our stuff people spent the rest of the evening on the bathroom because the food was so bad. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"As for the burger... nothing really  to write home about, but their crispy thin onion rings were quite tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out here for my 30th birthday and this was one of the places we wanted to check out. We are huge wahlburger fans and were very excited to try this place. Unfortunately in my opinion it was way overrated. The place looked cool and was super busy. Our server was nice but was way to busy to be attentive. Once she dropped our food we didn't see here till we were basically ready to pay. Never got drink refills or anything we needed extra for our meals as we weren't checked on after we got our food. Our burgers were pretty good but nothing to rant and rave about. Glad we tried it but not somewhere we would stop again next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Price was a little high but my husband enjoyed his food so that's why I gave it 4 stars. You could either dine in or take it to-go and sit outside. I ordered the melt with fries and my husband ordered the double decker with sweet potato tater tots. My husband said he enjoyed his burger and that he could taste all the ingredients and that it was flavorful including the pickles that they pickle themselves (or so I read). I stole some of his tots and those were really good, I now prefer them over the French fry version lol. The melt I ordered came with toast bread not on a bun. It was a little too greasy/oily/buttery for me, so after a good pat down I was able to eat it. The fries I got were a bit cold and weren't all that great. Its located right in front of the Bally's hotel surrounded by little shops."}
{"text":"It's not terrible but it's not great.  They messed up our order and before I knew it, I was half way done my buddy's burger - the original BBQ cheese one when I really wanted to try the OFD.  The patty was a tad on the small side and wasn't very juicy.  In fact, it was a bit overcooked and didn't taste as fresh like some other gourmet burger places.  The bun has some greasy layer on it, I prefer a more doughy bun to be honest.  The topping selections for each burger were good though.  Nice to have something unique like a Thanksgiving burger as an option, same with Turkey vs. Beef.  

The atmosphere was like a sportsbar and it was packed with people on a Saturday night.  You can tell people were excited to try out a new place.  I'd say the quality is definitely above McDonalds but below say a Burger's Priest.  Something in the middle, something average.  I also had the sweet potato tots which were nice and a Sam Adams Boston Lager, which was also nice for a change.  Prices were what one would expect for King West.  I could eat here again but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.  I could see out of town people eating here before/after a Jay game."}
{"text":"It was our first time coming here .. we were exciting to try this place out .. didn't realize they charge for each food items like fries or onion rings .. they charge around 5 dollar for those and it's a small portion of order fries or tater tots . I think onion rings are in good size portion   and drinks come with free souvenir cup cost around 5 dollar as well .. free refill which is good thing lol. Burgers wasn't a big size   it like almost the size of McDonald .. cost between 12-14 .. overall it does taste good and have their own flavor .. sadly Those food got me sick dunno why .. my husband love it .. the check came out almost 45 dollar for 2 burgers and fries with one drink .. It's an experience to try this out but won't come back"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Vegas for our honeymoon.  We sat at the bar and was immediately helped by Vincent.  He gave us our drinks right away and answered any questions we had.  I had the macaroni and cheese with bacon, and the onion rings.  My husband had the melt and fries.  All of the food was great!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!! Spent $38 (!!) for takeout for their Dorchester burger (dry and without any of the tomato jam advertised), crappy fries, frappe cookie shake and a salad that was so salty (?!) that I had to throw it away. Garbage. Go to A&W for 1/4 the price and a better burger. Anyone who likes this place has got to have their taste buds (and wallet) checked."}
{"text":"Visited Wahlburgers Saturday, July 16 close to 6:00pm. We were a party of 5, checked in and told it was about a 45 minute wait. Actual wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad since most reviews said it took longer. Once seated, it didn't take long for our server to come take our drink orders and soon after our food orders. For a Saturday, I thought it would be much busier. Food came out in about 20-25 minutes and everything was cooked perfectly. I had dads' basic burger, hubs had double burger, daughter had chicken fingers, bro in law had the sloppy joe, and sis in law had the thanksgiving day sandwich. We also ordered the bacon Mac and cheese, and onion straws. Everything was delicious, we loved the flavor of the bacon Mac and cheese and the onion straws were light and crispy with good flavor. Service was great, everyone we had contact with were very nice and friendly.
How much for all of this greatness? $99.00.
I get that it's Vegas and Wahlburgers, but even though the food was good it wasn't something that I'd have to experience more than once. And not at that price. I can get a burger combo elsewhere for what the basic burger alone cost here. Let's see how long Wahlburgers stays open once In N Out enters The Linq."}
{"text":"We were in sin city for a fun weekend and had just enough time to grab lunch before heading back home. 

After deciding on Wahlburgers for the name sake, we got sat fairly quickly. The menu has several options marked by the family's favorite items as well as standard burger fare.

The mimosa and Bloody Mary were pretty and according to my friends, also tasty.

The burgers were alright. Nothing special. A little greasy. 

The fries were decent. The onion strings were a huge disappointment, but the sweet potato tots were divine! Highly recommend!!!

The service was good and the atmosphere was bright and chipper.

It did take a little longer than expected for food, but it is what it is.

Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the hypes regarding this burger joint as everything here is a la carte and there's no combo meals, you have to order individual meals separately.  There are 2 levels of this restaurant, upstairs where it's self service, and if you are very lazy and don't want to serve yourself, you can sit downstairs and have someone serve you and enjoy the street view.  For me, I don't mind helping myself and watch everything from upstairs.

This location is located near the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and is within walking distance from all downtown attractions.  Very easy and safe to get to from anywhere.  I'm not really impressed with the food here but I can finally cross this place off my list."}
{"text":"My wife and I were walking around the Las Vegas strip and my wife wanted to try Wahlburgers (because of the television show), so we put our name on their list and waited for the text when our table was ready.  After a short 10 minute wait, we were seated inside.  My wife had the OUR Burger and I went with Jenn's Chicken Sandwich.  I wasn't expecting much from this much hyped establishment, but my sandwich was very good.

The Jenn sandwich had a seared chicken breast, topped with caramelized and crispy onions, lettuce and a honey & garlic mayo.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, the onion strings and honey mayo complimented the chicken.  My wife's burger was juicy and tasty and she said she would return anytime for another burger \"fix\"."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying Wahlburgers. I didn't hear much about this restaurant, besides that it was owned by the Wahlberg's. The menu isn't large so we were able to find something quickly. I ordered the \"Our Burger\" which was a regular cheeseburger with their signature sauce and fries. Mike ordered the triple decker which was the same thing but three meat patties and also fries. The food was okay, it wasn't really anything that impressed us. Mike compared the fries to \"concession stand fries\", simple and not much salt. I guess we had higher hopes of having \"gourmet burgers\", but for a Sunday lunch, it was good. We went around 1:30 and it was a 30-45 minute wait. I definitely suggest using the Yelp Waitlist prior to going."}
{"text":"After a long day of travelling and nearly missed connections we were ecstatic to have found Wahlburgers across from our departure gate.  I had never eaten at one of their locations and having seen a few episodes of the show, I was looking forward to the experience.  

I noticed that there was literally not a single person in the restaurant and asked if we can just sit anywhere.  Mandy, our waitress, who was wonderful, immediately came over to set a table up, explain the burgers and take our order.  We put an order in and were just hanging out relaxing, enjoying the comfortable, open space when we realized our plane was boarding 20 minutes earlier than we had originally thought.  Less than 5 minutes had passed since we placed the order with Mandy (our beers had not even arrived yet) and we asked if it would be too late to cancel the order.  She said no and went off to the kitchen to alert them.  When she came back she said that the burgers were already done!  Please note that all of their burgers MUST be cooked well done and each of ours had completely different toppings.  2 burgers and an order of onion rings done in 4 minutes?  We were shocked, but in a rush so took everything to go.  

We sat down by our gate to allow ourselves a minute to eat while the line died down a bit.  First appearances showed a burger that was not freshly prepared, and in fact, looked like it had been sitting for quite some time.  The cheese had visible signs of leeched moisture on it's surface, which as many of us know is a tell tale sign of prolonged exposure at room temperature.  The burger itself was just slightly warm and definitely well done.  A freshly cooked, well done burger would have at least been hot.  The avocado on my burger did not taste fresh and I could not even finish eating half the burger.  

We hoped the saving grace would be the onion rings that we got to split as a side. Instead, we were presented with a dense ball of onion slivers heavily breaded and fried to form some sort of inedible dish with little semblance to onion rings, as we know it.  

I hear that this location only recently opened, so hopefully they are just working out some beginners issues.  Regardless, these are issues that need to be addressed sooner rather than later.  Your restaurant and TV show claims \"our family, our story, our burgers.\"  If these burgers were any example of what the consumer can expect on a consistent basis, then this chain will not be around long."}
{"text":"First-highly suggest you check the wait list, and join before going during peak times. We were lucky to grab a table at the bar, and bypassed the hour+ wait. 

My daughter and niece proclaimed the burgers to be the \"best they've ever had\", and judging by the lack of leftovers-they were correct!

I've heard others complain about poor and/or slow service--we had the direct opposite. I highly recommend you try to get \"Jillian\" as your server! She was prompt, and super friendly! The best!"}
{"text":"Liz the bartender was awesome! She was super friendly and made really delicious drinks. Ask for Liz when you go, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Don't go here for the food.  I hate to write a negative review, but this place was such a disappointment.  I was really looking forward to trying this place out after having seen it on TV.  

I guess our first mistake was not ordering burgers at a burger place.  I ordered the Mac and Cheese and my husband order the Sloppy Joes.  My husband actually thought there was something spoiled in the Sloppy Joes and couldn't eat it.  I refused to try it.  

The Mac and Cheese taste like a cup of plain penne noodles with some chunks of bacon on top.  It had absolutely zero flavor.  For reference, I have a bland palate, so for me to think something has no flavor is pretty bad.

Drinks we just ok, but at least we could consume those.

Server never asked us how the food was or asked if we wanted boxes for the food we hardly touched.  

Second mistake was paying the bill without saying anything about how horrible the food was to the server.  We ended up having to go out for dinner (again) after leaving Wahlburgers."}
{"text":"I love the #wahlburgs. I was so excited to finally get to go to #Wahlburgers.  That excitement was shorted lived. There was a 35 minute wait.  My better half ordered one of the speciality drinks just like it was written.  The waiter had to come back to ask how he wanted it. The menu did not have another option how to make it.   The waiter seemed to be very impatient over the confusion. The place was crowded and it was loud. Service was not the best.  I ordered the bacon burger well done  and Adam ordered the fiesta #burger medium well.  For $14, I expected a larger burger.  I also expected that when I squeezed my burger that it did not moo and bleed. Adam's burger was well done.  We had to  switch meat patties.  The burgers were just bland and #greasy. The fries like the burger needed a dose of seasoning.  We were half way done with eating when waiter finally came back around. When we told him that we had switched our patties, he said oh I can take them.  We told him no that we fixed it. He could have  discounted the food or maybe offered the #onion rings for free.   The onion rings by the way were amazing.  I finally got to go to Wahlburgers but I would not recommend it for anyone else.   #disappointed"}
{"text":"WOW so much Hype and they DELIVERED.  On the first try so much could have gone wrong, especially with how busy it is.  Love the double triple check on the orders.   MY daughter's was the GRAND SLAM APPROVAL.  She's not a chili bean fan her remark and I qoute \"what is this, omg this is so good but how.\"  Great Cobb salad too.  Outstanding CSR on visit.  Huge fan of  the family, thanks for exposing a certain part of your private life to us and Pauly thanks for great food.  Mark and Donnie keep on going we need better food out there like this.  Moma Alma thanks and great job with these kids.   #wahlburgersgreatfood"}
{"text":"This is by far the best burger I've ever had!  It was perfectly cooked, the toppings were fresh and full of flavor.  The burger itself had a rather thick patty that was perfectly seasoned.  Services was good and fast, I'm excited to go here again!"}
{"text":"OK, if you just have to say that you've eaten at a Wahlburgers, go ahead and spend the extra cash cause this place is over priced for a burger joint.  It's probably OK for kids but I wouldn't bring them here more than once due to the cost. For the price you'd think you'd have luxury seating and all but that's not the case. Environment was OK for a burger joint. Service was good. Food was good, but overpriced."}
{"text":"I had the thanksgiving sandwich and sweet potato fries. They were both mighty tasty; overpriced, but tasty. 

The service SUCKED. Never received the sauce I asked for. Twice. Had to ask for a water refill - never offered to refill drinks. Ugh. Boo. Blah. Won't come back. 

Also it was very difficult to access and had no restrooms on site. Save yourself the bother and $80 and just eat at In N Out."}
{"text":"We first went to Wahlburgers shortly after they opened. It was mid-day during the week so there wasn't any crowd. We really enjoyed our food, but our waitress just wasn't very good. Don't get me wrong, she was very friendly, but once we got our food we didn't see her again until she brought us a check. I was hoping she would swing by because I wanted a refill on my water. But she never came back to check and see if the food tasted ok, or to see if we needed anything. 

Since we really did enjoy our food, we went back a second time. Our waitress was much more attentive. She even gave us some Wahl sauce to try with our fries. So far my favorite thing I've tried was the chicken sandwich. But the next time I go, I've got to try the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype surrounding Wahlburgers and I was excited to try their food. I felt the burger was average. Their special sauce on the burger was nice, but it didn't really set it apart from any other burger place. I didn't care for the fries, but that is just my personal preference as my husband loved the fries. I like slimmer more crispy fries, but I will say the food was fresh and brought out hot. I would visit again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. The service was good and our food came out quickly during lunch time."}
{"text":"The burger is good, like 5 guys or Smash, but they ask you how you want it cooked. They are not stingy with the sweet potato tots, and where else can you get sweet tots?"}
{"text":"So the wife took me here for the first time on my birthday. and I must say we were real disappointed. the service was ok but the food came cold my drink was flat all around disappointed we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers! 
Must try the bacon Mac and cheese. Thanks Wahlburgers Las Vegas!!
Great customer service."}
{"text":"OK--I get that this is a beef/burger restaurant, but in an airport choices are limited, so I (a vegetarian) decided to stay and have a Caesar salad and some onion rings.  The Caesar salad was remarkably 'blah.' It was just sort of-kind of fresh romaine, packaged cheap croutons, and powdered Parmesan like you'd sprinkle on a pizza. The salad was edible, but not worth paying for.  The onion rings were not at all like the photo on the menu, which shows discrete rings of breaded onion.  Instead, they were like super thin, shoestring-cut onions, deep fried as if they were going to be heaped as garnish.  In retrospect, perhaps they do use these to garnish the burgers.  I would not recommend the salad or the onion rings to anyone, and even if the burgers are good, there's no excuse for this.  If you're going to put a salad on the menu, do it right!  If the fried onions are in a floppy heap like garnish, don't call them onion \"rings.\"  Would not go back to Wahlburger...."}
{"text":"Amazing and not just because of the name hype! I've wanted to try this place since I first heard about it. I happen to be in Vegas on a spontaneous trip and happen to find Wahlburgers after walking down the strip! I had the Fiesta Burger and was not disappointed! My boyfriend ordered The Beast and he loved it. We also ordered chili cheese tater tots and holy shit... AMAZING! Everything was amazing. Customer service was impeccable and our waitress was awesome! And we got to keep the cups! So excited!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here during the Super Bowl game, and the ambiance was electric! We were seated quickly and our server was fast and friendly! I tried the BBQ bacon burger, a friend tried the patty melt, and we ordered some tater tots to share. They had regular taters and sweet potato taters. They were crisp and tasty, but I preferred the sweet potato tots. We ended our meal will the delicious dessert sandwich that had Nutella bananas and marshmallow... I think? It was a gooey, delicious way to end the meal and was large enough to share."}
{"text":"I thought they offered a good burger, but it wasn't anything overly special. It is below the Bally's casino. We sat on their small patio section and enjoyed the scenery and music of neighboring bars/restaurants. I would try something different next time I'm in town. It's easy and quick though."}
{"text":"OFD Burger was good so were the fries! Not worth the higher prices but it's on the Strip. A check on the list for burger joints to try."}
{"text":"Pretty good, fun and novel but wildly overpriced. 
It's an American style gimmick reminiscent of hotel lobbies in the south.
It's unfortunate because i think the Chef Wahlberg is probably pretty talented but it's overshadowed by overpriced meh food and kitch. Not to mention, there are so many dope burger joints in the area.
This is a tourist spot that will likely attract the hotel guests, but I don't see any locals making this their go to."}
{"text":"The one in New York is way better this the menu in Vegas suck they were limited to few option they did not have the Donni hot dog here. And the food was ok"}
{"text":"First time here ! Love it.
We are staying at the Bellagio Hotel and were waking around outside just to find something to do. There are so many good options in Vegas, so deciding what to eat can be hard sometimes. We stoped here and asks if the have any Vegas options. The hostess recommended the Impossible Burger which was excellent! So delicious! One of the BEST veggie burgers I ever had. The restaurant is nice and clean. Friendly staff. The bathrooms are outside under the stairs. I'll definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"This was our first time going to this restaurant and we were very impressed. Great experience! We were seated quicker than we were told. Service was prompt and attentive (thanks Victor!), and the food was excellent! In addition to the service and quality, the prices were extremely reasonable, especially for a restaurant right on the Strip! I would highly recommend this restaurant. And thanks again to Victor for helping us navigate our first visit!"}
{"text":"I just don't get it??? Service was good, but the food really is non descript, plain, no biggie. The burger was AVERAGE, nothing to write home about. The tater tots were cold, little flavor. This is clearly a tourist fad thing and unless the food develops some character ....."}
{"text":"I really Wanted to love this place. As big fans of the family. Our wait was an hour and I hoped it was worth it. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was busy! But it's Vegas everything is busy. No issue there. The wait staff we had was okay nothing special. Food was a HUGE disappointment. I ordered the BBQ burger and it had maybe a teaspoon of bbq sauce and little avocado. What irritates me the most is the food is cold!!! Sweet potato tots were soggy.  Our waiter never checked back until we had enough and we're ready to go.  I'm sorry not worth  50.00 lunch for two. Again I really wanted to support and like it."}
{"text":"Came in before the Indians/dodgers game. Seated right away outside and greeted by the server. Took our beverage orders and returned with them. We then placed our food order. The next time we had a table visit was almost 25 minutes later. Food almost took 45 minutes to come out. Got a total of 4 visits from the server including dropping the bill off. Maybe come back after they weed out some of the employees. Only nice part on this visit was the outdoor seating. That's why I'm giving this 3 stars."}
{"text":"We ended up here on Saturday night, I was staying at Bally's and it was right next door. I hadn't been back to Vegas since January 2013, so the whole Grand Bazaar area was completely new to me.

Detroit actually *just* got a Wahlburgers recently, but we were in line for Burgr (Gordon Ramsay restaurant at Planet Hollywood) and were quoted an hour, so we decided to check this out - I went with a Yelper who now lives in Vegas, and his girlfriend.

There are really only 3 burger choices which surprised me ... okay, maybe 4 - the plain burger, the regular burger (essentially the plain burger but with cheese), the double burger, and the triple. I got the plain burger and added tomatoes and pickles, plus mushrooms ($1 upcharge). We ordered the onion strings (yes, strings) and the sweet potato tots too to split.

My burger was overall fine, nothing special but that Wahlburgers sauce is really good. Almost reminded me of In-N-Out's sauce, actually. The onion strings were good but the sweet potato tots were fantastic, so I'd get those next time. The burger will cost you about $9.99-$10.99 and sides are $4.99. 

Hoping to check out the Detroit Wahlburgers now! It's a bit pricey for what you get but overall the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype around Wahlburgers. If the name wasn't so well known I don't think it'd be as big as it is.

We were walking the strip and I insisted coming here for lunch, as I never seem to make it to the newly opened one in Detroit and heard good things about it. There was a wait, but we were able to sit at the bar and not have to wait for the table. Bartenders ignored us for practically 15 minutes then played it off like they thought we were still looking at the menu and said \"are you ready to order?\". Really? Our menus were put down on the bar 10 minutes ago. To be fair, after that, service was much better.

We split the double burger and tater tots and ordered 2 beers. On the menu, the double burger sounded like it was big enough to split. That was not the case. For like $11 you get a burger smaller than a Big Mac. Flavor was OK, but the bottom bun fell apart making it really messy to eat. Tater tots were lukewarm and tasted previously frozen with no salt. Would not get again.

What's weird is 1) there's no bathroom inside 2) they have photographers who come around snapping pictures of couples, printing it out and bringing it over hoping you pay the million dollars for it.

Would not go to again...any location."}
{"text":"Walburgers - nothing to rave about.  Like a few have commented \"Not terrible but it's not great\".  I got the BBQ Bacon Burger  $10 - Burger itself was pretty small and the patty was dry on my burger.  With all the burgers places in Toronto I will not be coming back.  The price itself was on par with Priest burger which blows this place out of space.  You get what I am saying."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this joint since I've seen it at so many airports. The premium burger market is very crowded and unfortunately this one didn't live up. Would be fine as fast food at half the price though.

Our Burger: It's like Wendy's quality at Shake Shack prices. Burger was dry. Wasn't into the sweet pickle. The sauce wasn't anything special. Seemed a bit too bready for the amount of meat.

Poutine-ized Tots: The tots were fine, crispy on the outside and soft inside. The gravy tasted like something from a jar and was overly salty. There wasn't much gravy or cheese curds either."}
{"text":"Good food and it comes fast. Excellent sloppy joe and sweet potato tots.. I love the wahlbrewski, you need to bottle that. We also got kids tenders witch were good and my picky 2 year old daughter who doesn't eat eat everything after dinner we had amazing red sangria"}
{"text":"This was my daughter's choice for her birthday. We had the Chili, Smahlburger, the Melt and Mac & cheese - Everything was delicious! The hostesses were nice & efficient. Jess F. was our server. She was friendly & knowledgeable. Food order was perfect & quick. Brian brought out our food with a smile. We would recommend and return!"}
{"text":"Taste is good, but all of our burgers came out pink...the entire patty. Server told us that they don't ask how we want it cooked so they go with medium as a default. ADVICE: let server know how you want your burger cooked. Tried having our server change our orders to WELL-DONE, but she said it was too late and that our order would move to the end of all the orders that came in after ours."}
{"text":"Great burgers and service! The only thing missing was Tabasco and Cholula hot sauce being that I'm a Cali Girl"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for celebrity joints, and I'm a child of the eighties, so The Backstreet Boys, and now Wahlburgers, was a must see for me.  It's located right in the middle of the Strip and has lots of seating and a pretty good menu, including kids menu items.  Pity that the burgers don't automatically include fries.  And for over $11 a burger, it's pretty pricey.  But I did have to say, the burger was very good!  I had the Donnie burger, which had bacon and BBQ sauce.  Great combo!  The service was good, decor was nice and again, the food tasted good!  A little pricey, but worth a visit for a fan!"}
{"text":"It could definitely be a lot better. It wasn't horrible but it reminded me of fast food, cheap and hits the spot but not the most satisfying."}
{"text":"These place gets a 3rd star for service . I must say the service is great but the food looks very unappealing . Everyone was extremely nice but I could pass on the food. It's was such a disappointment! All the hype for nothing . I got the Thanksgiving Day Turkey Burger and it sounded good but the presentation proved otherwise . We also shared an order of sweet potatoes tater tots and there was no crispy outside , it was too saturated with oil that they were so soggy. Oh well it's the experience I guess ."}
{"text":"Would give it no stars if possible. I'll start with how bad the service was. All bar staff is pretty unorganized had no idea who was served. The food runners also had no idea where the food was going. I was mistaken with another tables order 3 separate times. They never ask if you would like a refill on water or sodas either. The food is what really got me. The onion rings look like fried onion rings from a can. Super thin, extremely greasy and no flavor. It just smelled like frying oil in a tub. The burger bun was also very oily. I had the ODT and felt like it could of been good except it also had a strong greasy smell to it. I might of just ate lard shaped and colored to look like food. Overall, terrible service and would advise everyone to not go there for a burger."}
{"text":"So dissapointed..it cost $48 bucks for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 2 drinks. Fry portions were small, tots were cold, and burger was marginal. Guess I just expected more. Can't hold a candle to 5 guys. Save your money and eat somewhere else for less."}
{"text":"I like watching the show, but in Vegas, the menu was very limited. I look forward to experiencing their full menu in Boston someday."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????

??????????????????????????????????????????

?????????????????????????????????????????????????

????????????????

To go??????????????
????????????"}
{"text":"Too freakin' good!loved the burgers and cups were super cool too! Service was great and the fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Had lunch there with the family. Burgers were pricey esp having government cheese on it. I upgraded my cheese, but my family didn't. They were sick all afternoon"}
{"text":"As a Marky Mark fan, I had to give this place a try. The burger was alright, it was just like any other burger in my opinion. The macaroni and cheese with bacon was sooo yummy! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sorry this is probably the worst service I have ever experienced.  Not a busy night yet it took more than 20 mins for the bartender to take my order. And another 35 minutes to get my food.  Not to mention every component of my order was incorrect. Wrong drink, wrong burger and never brought my fries.  It's not that hard"}
{"text":"I had the Portobello Sandwich and onion rings. The sandwich was delicious! But $8.25 for a small sandwich with no sides is too pricey. I also had the onion rings which were good. My biggest issue with Wahlburgers is the seating. This may just be the most uncomfortable I have been in a restaurant. The seats are terrible. I fidgeted trying to find a comfortable spot the entire time we were there. Would give 2.5 stars if that were possible."}
{"text":"Terrible, keep walking.
Ordered the bunless fish burger and received a burnt fish stick, reminiscent of a captain highliner product, on warm rusty lettuce with tartar sauce as a \"dressing\"
Onion rings were onion strings, clearly reheated in a microwave. On of my kids ordered Mac and cheese which was at best soupy. All for a ridiculous price.
Looks like a great place to work. Staff blasting music and enjoying socializing, ignoring customers.
Keep walking, you'll find something better and cheaper."}
{"text":"I have to admit when I first got my burger I didn't think highly of it. The bun was oily in my hands and the tiny tomato slice and tiny onion slice had slid off. BUT let me tell you, while eating it you wouldn't find me complaining let alone talking without a mouthful of burger. The bun (brioche style? soft, sweet, and a bit chewy) and beef were delicious. I had gotten an egg on top instead of cheese which made it even tastier. Though I do have to complain to Wahlburgers and all burger joints ever, if I say no to the cheese you put on your burgers and ask for something else listed alongside that cheese in terms of price, don't charge me extra. Jesus us lactose intolerant humans will someday revolt, it just doesn't make sense. The reason I'm not giving Wahlburgers more than a three is that their sides are basically garbage, don't bother. Tater tots? Make these at home. Onion strings? Gross, trust me."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to come here just eat say she ate there. The food took long to come, 1 burger was cold & the fries barely warm, nobody really enjoyed their food, & it really wasn't worth the price. The only good thing was a nice waiter. Also AVOID THE SLOPPY JOE."}
{"text":"I had Paul's favorite burger and my boyfriend had Donneys favorite and they were so good. Great flavor, juicy meat and super fresh . I recommend it !"}
{"text":"I honestly think this place deserves more than a 2.5 star review the food was great and so was the service. The only downside that I saw is that it's kinda crowded and I like my space while eating! I had the melt but modified it to my liking which didn't effect the cost at all and my partner had the eh' burger which he loved! The slightly more expensive prices were to be expected, as they are at any touristy location. Next time I take a trip to Toronto I will be returning to Wahlburgers to try something new!"}
{"text":"I am giving this one star because the service was horrible. We were seated and waited 10 mins for someone to wait on us. I ordered a beer and my bf ordered a tea. We both got burgers. The waitress brought the tea out and me a water. A good 25 mins goes by... no beer is delivered. Our waitress never came back until the food was delivered. In between the time she took our order and when the food arrived, I had to ask 2 different waitresses to bring me my beer. After the food arrived, my burger had onions and I specifically said no onions. It's like this girl didn't hear a word I said when she took my order. She was not attentive at all. When it became apparent that we were not happy she stopped by 3 times AFTER we got our food to check on us probably because she knew her tip depended on it. I don't understand what she was doing the whole time because the restaurant was not busy. I was so disappointed and I wont be returning."}
{"text":"Was so excited to eat here!!! Love all the Wahlbergs!! The food was EXCELLENT!! THE customer service was top notch! Thank you Victor for an amazing experience!!!! Will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas!!! Bring us a Wahlburgers in Seattle pretty please!!!! Much love!!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here and we ordered a BBQ burger, a black and white shake, and a caesar salad. The burger was delicious; their portions are very reasonable, which is great for me because I'm not a fan of huge, complex, packed burgers. However, the service was a huge disappointment. We went around 3:00 on a Thursday, and the place was not even close to packed. There were several tables open, and no waitlist. Our waitress seemed nice at first, until she gave us our check in the middle of our meal. My daughter still had at least 1/4 of her burger to eat, and we still had salad left. After placing the check at our table, she asked if we were done with our food. I began to question the professionalism of this waitress because it was clear we were not finished. I simply said no, and when my daughter finished her burger, the waitress was back... not even a minute later. She didn't ask if she could take the plate away; instead, she took the plate and the check and walked away without a word. I was very upset to encounter such a rude waitress. If she was in a rush to leave work, that's fine but she should've asked someone to cover her table instead of rushing my daughter and I to finish our food. Never in my life had I ever gone to a restaurant and received the check in the middle of our meal. I've eaten at places where the wait was more than 30 minutes, but the waiters and waitresses never gave me a check in the middle of our meal. I will come back for the food, but the service could really use a bit of construction."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here but left very disappointed. All of our food came out cold- likely was sitting for a bit. The server didn't check on us once. My burger was pink when I asked for well done. All in all a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Four instead of five stars only because the water tasted weird and the onion RINGS are actually onion STRINGS...big difference that I wish I would've asked about but when I asked do you have onion rings and answer is yes, I expected the big rings not little strings. With that being said, the purple onion strings were good. FYI if you've never been, the hamburger patties are not just ground chuck but a combo of angus beef made up of chuck, brisket and short ribs. 
The Wahlburg sauce is good."}
{"text":"This place is a joke 
Order my burger med and they put a burger in front of me in less then  5 min. 
Sandbag burgers are not my thing.... I only wish I took a pic of the burger...."}
{"text":"Came here for the novelty, left still hungry. My friends and I ordered the Thanksgiving burger, portobello burger, regular whalburger, and crispy fish. We agreed that the food was pretty average but not $10/burger worth.  

I ordered their tater tots $3.50 as my side, I would recommend them, they're actually quite fresh. We stuck with water which was continously replenished. They do serve local Amsterdam brewery blood orange radler which is exciting. 

The service was fast, friendly enough, table got cleared before we got our bills (good service? Or get out?). 

They were playing the Wahlberg reality show and as my friend cunningly put it: \"I don't want to see Mark Wahlberg in a private jet while I'm eating a burger\""}
{"text":"Wouldn't eat here again. It's basically fast food with a top dollar price, for no reason.  Way too much going on... music blasting so loud that you can't even hear the person next to you talking. Is this a restaurant or a nightclub/bar?? I paid way too much tonight just to have a mediocre burger and fries. 

I mean the burger had nothing special about it. I had 2 pickle rounds on it, which is something McDonald's does to me. A $10 burger should have a decent amount of pickles or a side pickle at least?  The bun was really soft and it tasted good but just nothing special about it. DEFINITELY not a $10 burger. 

Everything is just rushed.

I'm especially upset about the Caesar salad - I REPEAT, DO NOT GET THE CAESAR SALAD. It's very hard to mess up a salad but boy that was the most watered down Caesar dressing I ever had! It's like they had regular Caesar dressing, then some bimbo decided to add another cup of water to it and drizzle that over the salad. 

As for the service - our girl was okay. Nothing special. Gave me a weird vibe the whole time like she knew me and didn't like me, but smiled anyways. We still tipped her well. She checked up on us a lot. 

The only thing that really ticked me off was that I asked if they did \"SIDE SALADS\" she said yes. But she apparently misinterpreted what I had said and got me a regular full size salad - again, probably because the music was so loud we have to scream at each other. So I paid $7 for the shittiest Caesar salad that I ever put into my mouth (and I didn't even want that much of it, I was expecting a small 1/2 cup of lettuce, not a full plate.... that's what SIDE salad means) 

Also, the food runner girl didn't give us all of our food when she came out. She said \"okay, anything else I can do for you folks?\" Uhhh yeah ma'am you forgot all of our sauces that we ordered, and fries, and we ordered pickles on the side and you didn't bring any of that. 

So long story short, we won't be back and will not be recommending this place to anyone. Maybe if I paid a decent lower price I'd be more easy going on the review.... but hell no. If I'm paying $50 for a couple burger & fries, it better be a damn good burger and fry."}
{"text":"This place is horrible wish I could tell you about the food but after waiting 60 min for a table at a place that was empty, we waited 20 min for a server to take our order and then another 15 min before we decided to walk out we never got our drinks, no food, the floor was dirty, the tables were sticky. Everyone was super rude. If that wasn't enough the AC was hardly working the restaurant was located outside in Las Vegas  summer Weather a little AC might help!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! My fiancé wanted to try them because he admires Mark so much and I went there just for the sake of eating something but it was DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Worst burger in town. Way over priced. Shitty sides and the burgers were small and not good. It's a shrine for Marky mark and more or less a tourist attraction thst sucks. Never going back."}
{"text":"Sucked major weiner and came out cold, I thought it was going to be great because all my sisters and my mom watch the show. The staff was really nice, but I had to wait too long to be seated and it wasn't worth it. I won't be back, but what I will do is go to bobbys burger palace or chef ramsay's burger or burger brassiere or Guy Fieri's so basic any good burger place in vegas. I honestly don't want to be back, but I may give this place another try if someone begs me. It's not that the cold food wasn't okay, but that's all what it was bland and just okay. It's just seems worst because there are way better places near it that serves  burgers right."}
{"text":"After reading reviews  about Wahl burgers I know I will never go there and pay absorbent prices for a burger and pay extra for a side of fries. I will just enjoy my In and out double double with grilled onions or
 any of Carl Jr's selections. Adios Whal"}
{"text":"Had a great meal.  It's tucked away in the back of a new shopping strip of what appeared to be mostly closed shops which was a little disappointing and a little uninviting walking back.  But once we got there we checked in and they take your cell phone.  So we went walking around why we waited and got a call and text when the table was ready.  Menu selections were small and no Black bean burger which I could see and typically gravitate to since I do not eat read meat.  So I was between a salad, the chicken sandwich, mushroom sandwich or Thanksgiving Day Turkey Burger.  I went with the Wahlburg favorite Turkey Burger and a side of Sweet Potato tots to make my meal.  My friend got Chili, Onion Straws and French Fries.  The sandwich was awesome, everything worked together.  There is the cranberry sauce which gives it some sweetness that some people may not care for but I loved it.  The sweet potato tots were awesome light and fluffy.  The onion straws are a much get couldn't stop eating them.  The down side were the fried were just average would like to see some thick fresh cut fries because the other sides were so great.  It was a lot of food, would also be nice to be able to get a smaller portion of the side with the sandwich I was traveling for work and could only finish half the tots because the sandwich was so filling.  I hate wasting food so an option to put a handful of Tots in the basket with the sandwich would have been nice."}
{"text":"I had the impossible burger. It is yummy. Slightly over cooked though and pretty pricey. I ordered onion rings with that and it was super satisfying together. I may go back again if I'm in that area however I have found impossible burger cheaper in another restaurant.The wait staff are very friendly and accommodating. It's located in the ground desire right in front of Bally's."}
{"text":"Very good salad version of the burger for us low carb peeps. The lack of a customer facing wi-fi lost a full star.  When I asked about it, they said it would slow down the business one.  There are so many ways around this!  Set up two networks and prioritize one.  Set up d/l limits so that people working next door can't stream."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Placed was packed with big line to be seated, so I figured it was good food. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered the triple decker burger and the House dog. The burger was okay but I found the hot dog inedible. It was barely room temperature and the supposedly all beef hotdog had a rubbery texture that didn't taste like it was heated enough to serve (you know when you take hotdogs out from the fridge versus when you grill them? Like that.) Burger did give tortilla option versus bun but no low carb lettuce wrap option (protein style burger). I will say the hot dog was huge, but too bad it didn't taste good."}
{"text":"A hostess offered us a free photo (emphasized the word free) which would take 10 minutes. We had just ordered. I wanted to eat slowly but had to ask for a knife and fork. They gave me this flimsy mini plastic set. We were done for quite a while and hung around for the free photo. It was 2 inches by 1.5 inches. (You have got to be kidding?) They were willing to sell me a larger size. All this talk about Wahlburgers being about Friends and Family and they are just another grifter on the Strip.... and I had diarrhea the next day. What a joke."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give no stars i would have.  where do i begin?  first of all this Place thinks it's a high-class joint they have a maître d' with a walkie-talkie and they gave me the absolute worst possible  table and I'm not sure why maybe it's because I didn't bring more than one person with me and I was alone I waited over an hour for a burger and I was completely abandoned by all the staff I got up and I thanked the manager for the tea and left. do not go there. they think they're special but they are garbage and a shit hole"}
{"text":"Food was great!!! I tried the Fiesta Burger and an order of half onion strings half sweet potato tots ALL DELISH!! My only complaint, I asked for a well done burger and it came out with wayyyyy too much pink for me (more pink than a medium well burger)."}
{"text":"This was the only place we wanted to eat while passing through Vegas. The food was great and the atmosphere was nice. The only down fall I notice was I didn't know who my waiter/waitress was. A guy took our drink and food order then someone else came to fill drinks and check on us. Definitely would eat there again!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I especially enjoyed the fries because of they're choice of potatoes. I believe the service could've been better."}
{"text":"I was sold at \"government cheese\". I was giggling and later had to explain to my daughter what government cheeses actually is. Food and service were very good. Highly recommend Wahlburgers when you get a chance. Much better than I expected."}
{"text":"Loved Wahlburgers!  We went on a Wednesday night so it was not that busy so we were seated right away.  I had the Thanksgiving day sandwich and my husband had the bbq bacon burger.  We enjoyed both as well as the tater tots and mac & cheese with smoked bacon.  Delicious!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Got here with the family on a Friday night. Was quoted 15 minute wait but was more like 25. Received the text table was ready but a group of 5 was seated before us and they were a walk up. Not a big deal but whatever. 

Get seated and it's noisy. Hard to hear the misses who's seated less than 2 feet in front of me. Waiter came up, took drink order. I ordered the Arnold Palmer, please whatever you do watch out, the lemonade is a home brew and very bitter. It made my son made the bitter face. So I  ordered a regular iced tea. It's on ice but, it is butt warm. You'd think you order something that is supposed to be could would be cold not warm. Is the beer cold? 

Ordered our food and we had it faster than we were seated. Can someone answer that? 

Received our food and it was very good. I think for the price of the single sandwiches things like fries or onion rings should be included. 

After our food came we never saw our waiter or our server during our visit. 

Overall my / our experience is below average. I know it's  Vegas and it's for the tourists and its, for some a once in a lifetime chance to eat at Wahlburgers I think they should offer a discount of some sort for us Vegas locals. 

Life is about choices and we chose to eat here. We will not make the same mistake twice.  As a local we will never return."}
{"text":"We watched the show and we love the family. We saw the restaurant and wanted to support it. We waited 30 minutes. No problem- we played foozeball outside. We got seated and were served by a waitress who seemed annoyed with life. Fine - we all have bad days. The food was awful. Even my kids - 9 and 3 years old - complained about it. Cold bread that looks like it's from a pack that you buy in a \"warehouse\" store. Cold, tasteless meat that tasted pre-cooked. Yuck. Portions are small, and we paid $13-$15 only for each burger. Fries, onion rings, etc. are extra. I had the BBQ Bacon burger. Less than average. Finished in four bites, and I wouldn't have eaten it if I wasn't starving. My husband had what I think was called the \"fiesta\" burger, but I literally can't remember since the only introduction to it (when we asked for something spicy) was when the waitress brought over a napkin holder from another table and held it up to us so we could read the burger's description. Spice level was ok, but again, small and cold. The cheese in both burgers was cold and strangely chunky... Like nacho cheese dip that had sat out too long. We ordered onion rings and fries. They were average at best. I was genuinely sad that it sucked so bad. I'm shocked that it is so packed. I could only imagine it is for the name. Really, I'd be humiliated if my family name was on this restaurant. If the family really cares about the quality of the food and the satisfaction of their customers, they need to regroup. Oh, and our waitress couldn't care less about our disappointment. The only joy we had was when we took photos of the family on the wall and put snapchat filters on them. That was fun."}
{"text":"This place was such a nice surprise. I was craving burgers and this place delivered. Big time. 

The Our Burger came with 1/3 lbs patty, medium done and juicy. Good patty to bun ratio. Simply delicious!

Portobello Sandwich must be the best non-meat vegan sandwich I've ever had. You wouldn't even miss the usual meat patty. The mushroom was tasty and oh so juicy you'd make a mess for sure. This is something I would order again and again. 

For side, the onion ring was very good. Instead of big  thick rings, they were small strands of battered onion almost looking like calamari. Love it!

Service was friendly, full of smile and attentive. Pricing was fair, a lot cheaper than flashy burger joints in casino resorts. I have no complain at all.

I will come again for sure. This place is such a good find."}
{"text":"I would've given 5 stars but their bathroom is disgusting. There was TP all over, the changing table was knocked off the wall and the two stalls I tried didn't lock. BUT it was by far one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. And their onion rings caught me by surprise but wow! they're amazing too! We will be returning! Yum!"}
{"text":"I dined at Wahlburgs on July 21, 2016. The establishment was decorated very nicely and the staff was friendly. However, the air conditioner was not working properly. It was too hot to enjoy my meal. I had a grilled chicken Cesar salad. It was the worst. A bunch of lettuce, I could hardly see or taste the chicken. And the dressing was very bland. Also, I didn't like using plastic utensils...ugh....try cutting a salad up with plastic utensils. 

My friend had a burger which was just ok, she has tasted better. The onions rings were horrible....little dried up pieces of onions. Not your typical fried onion rings. And finally there is no restroom for customers. You had to leave the restaurant and go outside on the side of the restaurant to use a public bathroom. That is against the law....when you are serving more than 10 people you are supposed to have a restroom inside for customers to use. I wanted to wash my hands and I had to go over to a sink inside the restaurant to do that. I was very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect given all the bad reviews but I had a good experience and very likely to return again. 

I thought the \"Thanksgiving\" burger was really good. A large thick juicy turkey patty with a layer of turkey stuffing, followed by a layer of mashed sweet potato and topped with cranberry sauce. Very unique and delicious.

I had the side macaroni salad which was OK but a little plain. I will try the tater tots next time, they looked good. 

I sat at the bar where the service was good and my food arrived within 10 minutes. 

They have a decent beer selection on tap - Wellington Stout, Beau's Lug Tread, A nightmare on Elm Street, Mill Str. Organic, steam whistle and a house IPA (unfortunately sold out on my visit).

I found the restaurant kind of loud - so many conversations and Prince playing loudly from the audio system (Yuck). 

Many reviews complained about the high prices but I thought the pricing was normal for downtown -  $10 for a burger is the new norm. Sides from $2 - $5 and beer at $7.

{"text":"Read Yelp Reviews. Went in to check it out. 
ITS DELIIIIICOUS! !! I Loved it! Will come back again. I had: OurBurger and Fries."}
{"text":"Meh

I mean it was a burger. That's it. I hate it when things get hyped up cuz then I'm waiting for my mind to get blown. It was a tasty burger don't get me wrong just nothing special also was sort of cold ish.. 

The sweet potato tots or whatever were actually kinda weird. 

I actually like the interiors the green pops out well a bit much gloss on the chairs but works"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my family really enjoyed the taste of the burgers....however they are small....and crazy expensive! We are a family of 5, two teenagers and a 6 year old and we each ordered a burger and fries....no alcohol just iced tea and the bill was $100 with tip! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"It's good. Not great. Better than most burger joints and have a good selection of other sandwiches, salads etc. 
We got two burgers both requested for medium well. One came out medium well the other rare. 
You won't get fries here so get the crispy onion rings. Super thin and a little greasy but good."}
{"text":"After reading some of the disappointing reviews I decided it was time to test out Wahlburgers for myself. I would like to encourage more people to do the same as the reviews tend to be a bit over exaggerated in my opinion. 

The location of Wahlburgers is fantastic, it is right in the heart of Toronto. The set up inside Wahlburgers tries to be an innovative approach by being able to order cafeteria style or be seated and waited on. The staff is extremely rude and unorganized however the food itself is to die for. The burgers were perfectly cooked and the fries and tater tots were extremely additive. I will be back.

Food - 8/10 
Service - 2/10
Atmosphere - 7/10 (although I really do not like the whole green everything layout)"}
{"text":"The wave of negative review is a bit surprising as this place serves half decent burgers. The place is a mad house in terms of the crowds with lineups over half and hour or so even at off peak hours. My experience was for a takeout so will reserve the comment for service in house till I have dined in.
My friend likes Turkey burgers and with the recent review by a fellow Yelper (Thanks Billy K for cutting through the riff raff and providing an honest review) for Thanks Giving burger this was the choice we stuck with. We ordered a kids burger (beef) as the third person dining with us wanted a small portion (great value as its comes with a choice of a side) for sides we had sweet potato tots, onions and fries. 
The order took its time (15-20 min) and when we opened up the food at home it was still warm. 
On to the burgers nicely done a big pattie covered with stuffing. We also had caramelized onions as topping which went well.  Decent burger I would say 3 stars. I didn't try the beef burger but the person who tried it liked it as well. Sides were decent too with sweet potato tots being the crowd pleaser.  3 stars all said and done. The place does seem overwhelmed and I hope they will streamline soon in house."}
{"text":"When I got here and we were sat down, our server mentioned 18% gratuity would be charged to us immediately for our group.  Welcome to Wahlburgers can I take your order!  To be honest if you want to try this place I suggest going upstairs to the pick up/take out area where you can order a burger fast food style and sit down and eat it with unlimited pop to boot.  It's basically the same service as you would get in the restaurant, without the annoying TV monitors blinding you and your server telling you, you've been charged 18% gratuity, without even seeing the menu yet.

I ordered the Thanksgiving Turkey Burger with the sweet potato tater tots.  I was expecting a lot based off my friends recommendations and the TV show they have, but boy was I underwhelmed.  My burger was dry and tasted like it was previously frozen.  I could not even tell it was turkey to be honest and there was barely any stuffing or cranberry on it.  The tater tots were also pretty average and tasted like something straight out of a package of McCain fries.

Needless to say, I probably won't be coming back here unless I'm desperate for a burger or my friends drag me out here again.  Look elsewhere if you want quality fast food hamburgers like South Street.  Heck, even Harvey's is better than this place and about 1/4 the price!"}
{"text":"Just make this review real quick, this is a average  burger place nothing special  just that it has  A celebrity  name attached to it. The Customer service  was ok u till you want a refill the wife had to get up and get here while the servers where Jaw Jacking around the soda dispenser.  The food was ok and it was just ok nothing special. Then need to revamp the food pairings buns , size of meat Patty's and extra toppings.  Better burger at In-N-Out  or mom and pops burger joint"}
{"text":"Very, very meh.

We had the BBQ Bacon Burger which I thought was okay - nice heat from the jalapeno, slight bacon flavour, creaminess of the avocado. They indicate they cook all their burgers to medium. This burger was more like medium well.
We also had the OFD Burger - this was VERY medium rare, I felt uncomfortable eating it but couldn't do anything about it because we did take out. Had I been dining in the restaurant, I would have sent it back to be cooked more. The dominant flavour was the tomato jam - the mushrooms, bacon and swiss cheese were all lost. 
We had the yukon gold fries (tasted like frozen fries, pretty soggy) and the sweet potato tater tots (obviously made from frozen, but they were tasty.)
$33 for all that (no drinks!) - I will take that money somewhere else that uses quality ingredients and knows how to cook a burger."}
{"text":"The best damn sweet potato tots I've ever had !!! Burger was good , only thing missing is Mark actually being here"}
{"text":"Loovvvveeedddd my food so much! I had Paul's favorite. My sister did not like her burger but when I tasted hers it was the bomb as well. I don't know what she was taking about!"}
{"text":"Upon entering, the hostess immediately informed us all diners in the front would be charged an 18% gratuity.  Welcome to Wahlburgers!  

Is this a sit down restaurant or a fast food joint?  Actually, it's kind of a mish mash of sports bar (several screens), eat-in restaurant (servers), fast food (order and your food will be put into a paper bag for take-out) but you can also eat your take-out food in the back where you won't be charged 18%?  Weird.  

This burger was A-OK.

I tried the bbq bacon burger.  The 5 oz. patty was a decent size.  The bread was nice and soft.  There was a bit of kick due to the jalapeños.  

If only the patty was juicier though.  

For $9.95, it's not completely out of the ballpark."}
{"text":"Went there with absolutely no expectations whatsoever. 
Ordered a ceasar salad and it was absolutely perfect! Worth the try"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best in Vegas, we were served fairly quickly for it being such a popular spot on the strip. Plus the bartender Liz made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our wait for our meal. She was amazing! We will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"I went with family not having the best expectations but we loveeee the Walhberg's so we said what the heck. Let me tell you everyone in our party of 15 were amazed!  Great bar, great hostess, great waiter and amazing GM Jr. to make sure we had an awesome experience. The food was amazing. We tried all their recommended foods and drinks and we were wowed!!!  We'll be going back every time we have family in town which seems to be every weekend. Haha."}
{"text":"It's at Terminal One once you have cleared American customs. The selections on this side are really limited , consisting of one high end resteraunt, Timmies and this place. Hence it was quite busy when we went. I had been to the Walburgers downtown and it wasn't anything special.  

I got the OFD and my partner the normal burger. We were both starving, after already having a busy day. She got the onion rings , I got the fries. 

All in all not the best burger, not the worst. Best of limited options."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place considering 1. I love burgers and 2. I assumed if you put your name on something you're damn proud and are letting fans know you stand by your food. Service was pretty terrible.. there were 3 others at a table and looked like enough people to support us inside and the others outside. Our server didnt come up to us until about 10 mins after seating for out drink selections while acting very frantic like he was overwhelmed. We ordered a BBQ burger and the O.F.D. both medium. Only thr O.F.D was medium and the flavor was.... pretty flavorless. Would i pay 12 bucks again for these burgers? No way- go to fat burger, go to in&out burger.. honestly, go to burger king! Super disappointed"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. Would go again but not rushing back. Very limited menu-no appetizers...not a big deal. I expected it to be a notch below Burgatory and it was. Although, it was every bit as expensive. It was fun and it was good enough but I don't feel the need to go again soon. Service was good. Went on a Saturday and if you don't use Yelp's \"no wait/get in line app\" you'll be looking at an hour and a half wait by 5:30 pm. I would recommend it but not expect \"gourmet burgers\". Don't think of this review as negative because I don't mean it to be. It's just that the \"burger bar\" has been raised significantly in the last ten years and I suspect Wahlburgers wouldn't be making quite the noise that it is were it not for the name. Like I said earlier though, I'll go again because we had a nice experience overall."}
{"text":"Great burger, poor service and sides. Also a little pricey!

The burger was amazing for both my fiancée and I but the sweet potato tots were mushy and not very good at all. The onion strings were good but our server Oscar forgot about our sides so we were both half done with our burgers when our sides finally came and only because I reminded him about them and that was after flagging him down!

Overall it's cool you get a souvenir cups as your drink and the burger is really good but poor sides and service means I may not come back or come back only one more time to see if the service got better. Maybe get the burger to go? Lol

$50 for two burgers, two cokes, two sides? Very pricey! But you are paying for the Wahlberg name of course. Big fan so that is why we went and we watch the show.

Interior is great with pics of the brothers with their mother poster of Mark's movies."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp,

It's been far too long. I've missed you so much but I'm back.

I remember when I first heard about Wahlburgers, Thanksgiving weekend 2014, while watching a 24 hour marathon highlighting the beautiful Wahlberg family on Bravo! 

Needless to say when I found out there was a Wahlburgers coming to Toronto months and months ago I knew I had to go. I mean c'mon! This is a family that pisses success. Mark had Planet of the Apes and Fear, Donnie has Saw and Blue Bloods and surely Paul would have hamburgers (and accoutrements). 

However, I never was able to find time to take a trip to Wahlburgers. That all changed tonight when a few co-workers (maybe someday full blown friends?) and I went after work!

This burger is \"A-OK\" (as yelp! described my choice of a 3 star review). The burgers are more or less on par for the price point of a small chain burger in the area. You're looking at roughly 15-20 dollars for a combo which is expensive but at this point I'm sure you're used to it. They have some unique options and a lot more poultry than you'll see at other burger places in the area. Their choice in salads and \"tots\" is also a nice change that I'm sure is tasty. I tried neither but the onion skins were delicious if not a tad greasy.

At the end of the day Wahlburgers gets the job done and is LLBO. The fact remains that their are too many 4 and 5 star options around for me to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Got a BBQ Bacon burger and Wahlbrewski. The burger was a good size and cooked such that it was still juicy. They don't skimp on the toppings and cheese. The avocado paste kind of gets lost in the other toppings. All in all, I'd have it again.  This beats so many of my Pearson airport food experiences."}
{"text":"Not sure why the 3 stars but the burgers are good with a great roll. Cant go wrong with tater tots. Staff was great and very friendly."}
{"text":"No Bueno tried it not what I thought for i'm famous celebrity that's trying to do a good burger old lines plastic beer glass not clean cold burger won't eat again oh forgot to mention overprice"}
{"text":"We ate Wahlburgers at Thursday afternoon and we could not have been more pleased with our experience. Our host Carley B. and server were friendly and expedient and our burgers were DELICIOUS! We will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain style restaurant but I had high expectations given the celebrity status. I love burgers so had to try this place out. We both had the double burger - the signature burger. It's on the smaller side but the thickness makes up for it. It looked really good but sadly was dry and lacked flavour. Website says they cook their burgers to medium but apparently that has changed and they do them well done now. Despite the thousand islands type sauce and American cheddar, it was still quite bland; the burger itself needs more seasoning. The bun was a good though. We also had the sweet potato tater tots and onion rings. Both ok but nothing special. I had a glass of wine and my partner had a sangria which was clearly made from a mix and didn't taste very good. 

We had to point to our drinks on the menu because the server didn't know what Pinot or sangria was.  I mean come on they were both right off the menu. 

$70.00 for all of the above, including tip. Totally not worth it. 

You've disappointed me Marky Mark. I expected more. #wahlburgers #burgersto"}
{"text":"Party of 8. No outside drinks allowed in.. prices were average on the strip .. the tator tots , side of ranch and the strawberry lemonade were big disappointments.. but everything else was great freshly made and our waiter was greatness .. he even mentioned I would not like he ranch and brought out the signature sauce with it for me ... we would for sure eat here on the strip again !!"}
{"text":"Had the OFD burger here last weekend with a side of tater tots. It was the greasiest thing I've had in awhile.... Just between greasy and delicious with it finally going down towards too greasy.

Had to walk for awhile and drink rums and cokes before the mess finally settled in my stomach."}
{"text":"An interesting place. Kind of more an upscale sports bar and I always like a place that puts their own personal flair into it. One entire wall of the place is to list all of the tv and movies the Wahlbergs have been in. Food was great, had a Basic Burger with fries and it was fresh and delicious. My friend did not care for the onion rings as they are not rings but more like small curls and more crunchy. The staff were pretty bland and had little energy. Overall, delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Bartenders/Servers were not busy but really did not care to wait on anyone.  Once they finally took my order, they did not bother to ask how I would like my burger to be cooked.  It came out black/burnt on the outside and about as well done as a hockey puck on the inside.  Never checked to see if everything was ok.  Had to flag them down to get a 2nd beer.  Asked for ketchup and she brought an empty bottle. As soon as I picked up, I could tell it was empty.  Had to flag her down again to ask for more ketchup.  The bar was not busy but everything seemed to be a hardship.  I could not wait to get the bill to leave.  Once the bill came, they had charged me for 3 beers when I only had 2.  I was so done that I just paid and left.  Wahlberg's needs to either pull this location or get someone to serious monitor them as they are destroying the brand.  As I work in the industry, I know this is one location and I hope to visit a location in MA someday but so many people that pass through this airport will only have this one experience and it is sad."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting a sit down fancy atmosphere. It's a casual, standard burger joint. They have nice booths set up as well as counter space. Drinks are expensive for a diner setting but bw two people 16 each for a bottle is ok. I really like how you can order from kids menue which is waAY cheaper for exact same food just smaller sizes w out the sass. They are very into the fact that the Wahlburg fam owns the resto. They constantly play a video of the fam which is very sweet. The guy who was helping us was very chill and open to answering qs and make great convo. I loves there side dishes, shout out to the sweet tater tots for no extra charge., love it! Slider wize, not the best burger I've had, but 5 dollars for all appy hit the spot! And the burger was quite juicy, just with the increased burger joint trend going on in the city there's a lot of competition so you gotta bring your  A game. I will go back here more for the novelty but would chooSe another burger place for quality if I had the choice."}
{"text":"After waiting 15 minutes and nobody came to our table we left. It was Sunday afternoon, no Indians game, it wasn't crowded there were open tables. We noticed other people were not getting service either. Very disappointed as we were excited to try their burgers.  I chose one star because it made me, obviously I would have chosen zero stars."}
{"text":"Eh. Long wait but that was to be expected since it is new. Server took awhile to great us. She was nice enough though. Food was mediocre at best. Didn't realize plastic cups are a thing beyond fast food. Husband didn't enjoy either. I guess that's a thing with celebrity owned places they just rely on the name to keep them in business."}
{"text":"First, I adore the Wahlbergs. So of course the name drew me in. I came to this location with my sister. It was fairly easy to find and it's located outside of the Bally's. My sister and I arrived around 4:40pm on a Monday and it wasn't crowded at all to our surprise, although it did later. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and was seated in a booth shortly after. 

The waiter came within 3 min and took our drink and food order. We both order alcoholic beverages which were good (can't remember the name since it was a special drink for that day) and we both ordered the 1/3 burger with French fries and the star of my day the chili. The chili omg was so good. It had the right amount of spices and beans. 

Overall, our experience was good. The burgers were tasty and cooked to our preference, the fries were hot and fresh, the chili  and the drinks were all good. I definitely recommend stopping by if your looking for a burger place."}
{"text":"I'm a diehard NKOTB and I Love Mark too! So I had to try this place. I had Donnie's Favorite BBQ bacon burger Omg! It was the best burger I ever had! I felt like a so happy being there :) while enjoying some delicious food I was sharing my childhood stories of me being a crazed NKOTB fan. The service was amazing the staff was so attentive , the place so clean I will definitely visit Wahlburgers again"}
{"text":"As a fan of the show, I was expecting a \"gourmet\" burger designed by a \"CHEF\" (Paul). Instead, I got terrible fast food. I really wanted to see what the \"wahl\"sauce tasted like but there was so little I still have no idea. The burger was so dry, I had to dip it in ketchup. Overall, my burger was tasteless and dry. The presentation was also not gourmet, but standard fast food. 
 
At my table, everyone's fries were cold. There were only 5 of us, but it took quite a while to get our orders out and I'm guessing that's why the fries were cold. I had the lemonade, and it also wasn't good.
 
Service was on par with the food. We were mostly ignored. After placing our order, it took a long time and someone other than the person we placed it with stopped by and dropped off our food. We then only saw the waiter when he dropped off the check. 
 
I work on the strip and warn everybody that mentions going there to change their plans. 
 
All 5 of us that dined there agreed WE WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!
 
In conclusion:
1. Terrible Food
2. Horrible Service
3. Nothing Like the Show"}
{"text":"Very good would definitely get again! I got the \"our burger\" and it was your regular burger w lettuce tomatoes cheese and it was awesome! Perfectly cooked and the patty was seasoned very well definitely not your average burger. Not too big or too small just right. I had a single patty that day because we had reservations for a late night dinner but was hungry in between so ended up just getting one patty. I think I'll go for the double patty next time for the whole meat experience"}
{"text":"TL;DR: I ordered a salad but got a slippery sammich

I had such an adventure ordering here! I was waiting for a flight nearby, so I thought I'd try Marky Mark's for the memes. Note that I never expect airport joints to live up to or be representative of their counterparts in the real world.

I ordered a Jenn's Chicken Sandwich as a salad bowl (because your girl needs some fibre, and it's the same price) to-go, and was pleased that the order came a bit faster than the posted 15-minute wait.

I sat back down at my gate, waited a few minutes, opened the bag and noticed my order was packed without cutlery. I then noticed why, as I was holding a burger-shaped take-out box labelled \"Beef BBQ\". Concerned that my order had been mixed up with the guy's before mine, I opened the lid to find that it was indeed a chicken sandwich, but a regular non-salad sandwich with a bun and stuff in between.

At this point I was just hungry and waiting for my boarding call, so I didn't bother going back to trade my bread for more lettuce.

A few bites of this sandwich filled me with nostalgia, like I was a child taking a loving bite into a coveted, significantly cheaper, McDonald's burger. This feeling was shortlived because the contents of the burger, which had a disproportionately high garlic mayo:other things ratio, quickly slipped out of the bun. 

(Once the burger had de-constructed itself I did kind of wish I had picked up some cutlery).

So in a way, I did kind of get the salad (or lettuce-mayo slaw) experience. The bougie-ness of the individual components of the burger were much more easily appreciated once they'd fallen out.

The chicken was alright though."}
{"text":"Really delicious, Donnie favorite burger is my favorite. Little spicy but so good  fries are basic and the onion rings were good but very skinny like shoe string onion rings."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Specifically what I ordered which was the Impossible Burger. It's a new item on the menu and is $18 for the burger without any sides. I could eat this plant based burger for the rest of my life instead of beef. The rest of the restaurant is nice but definitely touristy. This place is good for couples or even the family. Thank you."}
{"text":"The burger is a little small but what do you expect on the strip. I had the bbq bacon (recommended from Ronnie at the bar) It was extremely flavorful, very tasty, and the fries have a great season to them. Coming from a company that strives on customer engagement, Ronnie at the bar had a great suggestion, great customer service, and a great personality!"}
{"text":"Swing and a miss. 

Had Wahlburgers at the airport in Boston and absolutely loved it. Was very excited when they opened one in Cleveland. The outdoor seating area is great. 

The entire staff needs to be retrained. The food was so-so compared to what I had at the airport Wahlburgers, which is not a good sign. My girlfriend ordered a salad that came out without any dressing. Took almost 20 min for us to finally get an employees' attention to get some dressing and they could not have cared less. 

The Wahlburger name is strong enough to keep pulling in people but if ownership cares about having a successful restaurant they need to retrain or rehire the entire staff"}
{"text":"Great burger and overall not to bad price wise considering being in Vegas. Wasn't happy about the 5 bucks for a coke though."}
{"text":"Had the our burger..very good taste not to overwhelming to where you felt like you over ate. Love the tots and great to finally have a wahlburger!!!"}
{"text":"Marky Mark & Co. are failing the masses. Came here with a Wahlburg-obsessed friend, hoping for a good experience despite the lackluster reviews. As we got seated at the bar, the couple next to us was raving about their meal- things seemed to be looking up.

But despite ordering a wide swath of the menu, most dishes had execution issues: the thin-cut onion rings were arguably the best dish we tried, but were served cold. The patty melt we ordered featured unmelted \"government\" cheese and an overcooked patty, not sure how the kitchen managed that unless the patties are precooked. The house-made pickles and Wahl sauce were tasty, but not enough to save that burger. Added on Alma's Famous Macaroni per raves from other reviews, belatedly realizing this was a pasta salad. It was fresh with lots of chopped vegetables but seemed to be missing something in the unbalanced flavors. Tried to end our meal on a high note with a spiked milkshake, but the Fluffanuttah didn't look or taste at all like the menu description. 

Not sure how this place stays so packed- the wait for a table was 30 minutes even after the lunch rush on a weekday. Prices are standard for the Strip location, but the quality is subpar."}
{"text":"Actually a 2.5.

Decided to try this location as per a friend's recommendation based on what he heard.

The dining area is clean and well kept, very welcoming. The food however was a huge disappointment. In my opinion, it was overpriced and you get very small portions. I got the triple burger (the largest thing on the menu) and it was still tiny! I was still hungry after eating it. The quality of the food and taste was good, but I won't be back here because I don't believe the value for money makes sense at this chain.

Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend - I would tell them to go somewhere like Hero Burger or Five Guys instead."}
{"text":"Not impressed!  I heard from family and friends prior to this visit to not bother. But group I was with wanted to try. Let's just say the joke around the table was a Whopper from Burger King woulda been better! Yikes!  I'm hoping visitors to our city take advantage of the great cuisine Cleveland has to offer, including awesome burger spots...this is not it!"}
{"text":"I understand that the place is busy since it is located near the gates serving the US. That being said, sitting for 20 minutes at the bar before they took my order and then waiting 30 minutes for an okay burger incorrectly made and served with greasy fries is totally unacceptable.  For quality of the product reference the  greasy product served at 5 guys.  Same greasy product without trying to be something it is not.  Thought it might be cool to try the place after seeing the hype but will definitely go somewhere else the next time.  Also, it nay have been 8 oz pre-cook but they use the fattest hamburger they can get their hand in so what us served is smaller than a McD's quarter pounder and at twice the price.  by they way, they remade my burger but nearly missed my flight since it took another 20 minutes to get it.  Di yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"First-timers on this trip. Big fan of the show...and the W brothers all the way back to NKOTB and Marky Mark. The restaurant did not disappoint. Food was delicious and who can't appreciate government cheese?  We even had the opportunity to say hello to Donnie via FaceTime! How cool is that?"}
{"text":"Well, what do you expect from a place at the airport? Not much and that's exactly what I got here.

After paying $25 for a BBQ bacon burger, poutine fries and a large bottled water, I was kinda disappointed as I've heard \"good\" things about Wahlburgers. Personally, the poutine was average AF and didn't have much flavor. The bottled water was $4.80 which was expected. The flavor of the burger wasn't bad, but the jalapenos it contained wasn't spicy at all. It didn't even have a kick to it and the burger itself was small.

I'm aware that airport prices are higher, but still... I was expecting something decent for $25."}
{"text":"Food was good, Service was awesome! They're even opened for breakfast! My husband had the Elvis breakfast sandwich, which was extremely to rich for me but he loved it. I had \"Marks Favorite\" (thanksgiving day burger), which was good.  However; I wish the stuffing \"patty\" was more crisp and not so soggy. I think making the stuffing the bun would be awesome! That's how I plan on making it the day after thanksgiving :-)"}
{"text":"The burger was served hot and fresh, unlike my last visit here, the fries were fresh and seasoned well. Service was excellent and attentive. I really can't get over the prices... 

From the forces available at the airport, it it's still a solid choice.

I like the loo and feel to the place"}
{"text":"The place is very busy. The service was fast and the food was good.  I would recommend it for a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"We decided to try Wahlburgers, since we had heard good things about it. We sat at the bar for immediate seating. The bartender was very charming.  I inquired about protein style burgers since I am not supposed to eat bread. I was told that they place the burger on a bed of lettuce instead of wrapping it in lettuce.  I decided to give it a try with a double burger. When it came out it looked like a chopped salad.  This seem too surprised both the bartender and me.  He told me that they usually just put the burger on the lettuce and not chop it up and mix it.  I would have preferred the way it supposed to come. My dining companion ordered a surf and turf darker. It was definitely on the light side with the lobster. The onion rings were indeed thin, as we were told they would be.  They were shoe string onions.

They did comp my \"burger salad\", as it was not what it was supposed to be. That was a good move and the right thing to do. We will be back but I will be much more specific about my order."}
{"text":"The pros:
- It's a Wahlburgers! If you're a fan of Donnie, Mark, NKOTB, or the reality show (or all of the above), you'll definitely want to stop here.
- The menu is full of yummy sounding burgers, apps, sides, shakes, desserts, sandwiches, and more. The burgers all looked and sounded great.
- I ordered the sloppy joe and absolutely loved it. Very plentiful portion. And it quite delicious.

The cons:
- The service is far from stellar. This is a chain restaurant in a tourist trap location and the servers all know it.
- The location sucks. You get so many families and obnoxious tourists (you know, the kind that actually bothers to go to the Bazaar Shops at Bally's).

All in all, I was pleased. As an NKOTB fan, I liked checking out the decor and just experiencing it. And I actually really liked my sloppy joe."}
{"text":"Ill start by saying, im giving two stars instead of none because I always try a place twice before I write them off. You never know the circumstances for the day...
We went on Tuesday night around 930pm. We sat to the left of the hostess stand where there are 6 tables. Two were empty and two were sat the other looked like they were leaving, and us. I like to review places that ive visited honestly and completely. 
We sat for 12 minutes when a girl came and said, are you ready to order. Just that. I was already mad that no one said one word to us at all after she sat us.  So we ordered, and to make a long story short, it wasnt a good experience. We waited, and waited then the burgers came, no sides. Burgers were cold for sure. 5 mins later the two sides came but we were just about done. It seemed like they kept changing servers.???... 
no one came back over, not once for 22 minutes when the guy took my dish and left the check. 
Again, trying to be fair, I did leave 10 tip on 47 bill. It hurt to do that VERY VERY much. The whole time they sat another table, that table ate and left, and I finally waved down the check. 
I expected SO much more from them. My son, who thinks im overly critical of everywhere, was so pissed off at the whole experience. 
I may go back again to see if that was s fluke or not. The only thing that was hot was the onion rings and we never got the sauce, mayo or a drink refill, which my son usually has a couple.  Im sad by this experience because I feel like Paul would feel terrible with the way the meal went. I cant imagine his quality, for his food, is what we received. I know chefs, doesnt matter how big you are, your food and the reproductions of it, come from the heart and any bad one is like a knife to the heart. 
It pains me to give two stars, but if we go back ill revise it, if its better. After last night, its not hard to get better because we started at the very bottom."}
{"text":"Definitely is not just a name. I highly recommend checking it out if you are around one. We went for lunch on a sunday and only needed to wait 20 mins. I got the bbq bacon burger and it was one of the best bugers I've had. Nice soft bun, crispy and easy to bit bacon, perfectly cooked patty. I asked for medium rare and it came out perfect all the way to edges. We tried the fries and onion rings. Go for the onion rings. Fries were pretty standard but those onion rings I'll crave now. I also tried their beer and it was super drinkable. Ordered another one for walking the strip. Overall, I highly recommend and can't wait for one in Chicago!"}
{"text":"The burgers were juicy! I tried Dave's Favorite (Our Burger) and my husband had Donnie's Favorite (BBQ bacon). The meat temperature is cooked to order. The buns are very soft. We also split some sweet potato tots which were very tasty and didn't taste oily or overly fried. The burgers aren't hue but they're filling so unless you're a eater I recommend splitting a side order. The place is decorated in the same color scheme you see on the TV show. The only two downsides to the location is finding parking and navigating to the place from a nearby casino. It's also Vegas and it's not completely enclosed so the temperature is not as cool as inside a casino."}
{"text":"Tried 3 burger places tonight in Vegas: Shake Shack, White Castle, and Wahlburgs. Hands down the last burger of the night Wahlburgs was the best, tasting, quality, and value. Will be searching out more of these yummy morsels!"}
{"text":"Burgers were dam good!! My only complaint would be that I had to spread out the \"toppings\" ! The mushrooms, jalapeño, and pickles were all in little piles. Couldn't get the full effect of the sandwich til I spread everything out! Love it, great place.. bartender's were awesome!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out the Wahlburgers restaurant. There beer selection was ok. They had Dog Fish 60 mins, which I love. They also had a local brewery (East End) which I like but the beer they decided have on tap was not my favorite (an Ale).

Anyway, I ordered the BBQ Bacon burger. It was just ok! That is troubling because (1) the burger was around $10, (2) it did not come with fries, (3) I didn't taste any BBQ sauce, and (4) the description mentioned jalapeños and there was only one on the burger.

This place is a big DISAPPOINTMENT. It's on the same level as Applebees."}
{"text":"We LOVED this burger joint. I got the Our burger with onion rings. Great atmosphere. Staff was really friendly. I ate here for lunch and loved it so much I wanted to go back for dinner. Got to also leave with a free souvenir photo"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with this burger 

Obviously had a lot of hype behind it, but definitely did not live up to the expectations IMO 
 
It's a decent burger, I would have given maybe 3 stars but its a 1 because the price was way off, should be at least a couple dollars cheaper. You're better off going with either Burger Priest or Holy Chuck if you're paying that money"}
{"text":"Ugly logo but they have two saving graces that make it 4-stars - The Beast and the fried onion strings. The Beast is appropriately named as it is stacks multiple patties with pulled pork. For those wondering, The Beast is 1 burger, not 2, as the menu could confuse you to believe. But yea The Beast has got my mouth watering just thinking about it....super flavorful and juicy...it's straight up dripping with the appropriate amount of tender fatty goodness. As for the onion strings, I'm just a fan of onion strings in general so when fried up right, I'm a happy camper. The Ranch and Wahlburger sauce aren't that good though...they have a strange flavor that don't complement the onion strings or fries...I'm sticking with the Heinz ketchup. Everything else on the menu might as well not exist since The Beast and onion strings are all I need. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wahlburgers blew me away.  Each time that I have been there, the food is always fresh, good quality and served hot!  The wait staff and greeters are all very nice and pleasant.  Excellent place to come and unwind!  Would recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Hype, hype, hype...wayyyyy overly hyped. 

Surprisingly, my only favorite thing served at this celebrity-owned burger joint is.... the delicious homemade chili. The chili is super-flavorful and packed with the thickness of ground meat and saaaaauce. 

Don't get me wrong, we tried one of the basic burgers, which was nicely presented- almost like a \"fake tv commercial burger\" that looks too good to be true. The burger was okay. I will give major props in the fact that the bun stayed intact throughout and up until my last bite. Nothing grinds my tires like when I am on my second to my last bite on a delicious burger and the burger bun starts falling apart. How rude? Anyone else hates when this happens. The buns served here at Wahlburgers are pretty legit; nice and spongey. 

Let's not forget that I also tried the Cobb Salad. Holy shnikey's! This salad can feed four and any of their best friends. This ensalada is HUGE, and very plentiful.

Okay food, so much okay that I'm not running back for seconds when there's a shake shack down the street."}
{"text":"Like most things in Ballys and in their Bazaar area this place is overpriced.  The melt was recommended by our server and it was just ok at best.  The fries were ok, nothing special. There is typically a wait for this place too so definitely don't waste time waiting to eat here."}
{"text":"Honestly it's all hype here. Lacked flavor & was overpriced for what you get. I have no problem spending a lot of money on food, but it better be something amazing & worth it. 

Went in around 1230am & it wasn't too busy. The wait to sit down was around 15-30 mins so we opted for the takeout order and sat outside at Starbucks. 

We ordered the: 
Our burger- it was nothing spectacular, it was a basic cheeseburger with LTO, pickles & their special wahl sauce. We've had better burgers for a cheaper price ( In-N-Out or Red Robin). It honestly lacked in the flavor part. I did like that they use FRESH lettuce and it was shredded. I hate when I get burgers with wilted/warm lettuce and the freshness of it made a difference. 

French Fries- regular fries, there was a light seasoning on it and I wish they had a little more on it because it probably would've gave the fries more flavor and taste more than just a regular frozen fries from a bag.

Onion Rings- thin strings of battered onions fried and seasoned. It was a very generous portion but nothing phenomenal about it. It was kind of soft and which I think of onion rings, I don't imagine it being soft. Read all these reviews of it being the best ever and it didn't live up to the hype. I wish it came with a sauce of some sort to dip it in, it probably would make a difference. 

Overall, it was an alright experience but I do think it was overpriced for what we got. I had such high hopes for this place because I love their tv show & always heard good things of this place. 
Maybe we came on a bad night?? 
I might consider coming here again and seeing if there's a difference in the future."}
{"text":"Service was great, we got there at midnight so there was no wait to get seated and wasn't crowded at all. Tried their melt, a whalburger and their Mac and cheese. Everything was good, but not amazingly delicious to where I would come back if I was back in the vicinity again...they are decent.  There are other burger joints that I'd give a try. But it was def. worth a try."}
{"text":"What an awesome new place!!! This was our third time at Wahlburgers. The new open seating option at the bar is really cool, as it cuts down the wait time at dinner to get in. This time, we came for lunch, and we walked right in. After starting with a cold Wahlbrewski, we moved on to our salad and Mac n cheese course. The mac n cheese was awesome! Then we went on to enjoy, of course, a one of a kind delicious burger. Our server was friendly and attentive, and food was quick! This is definitely the hottest new place to go! I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I severely underestimated Wahlburgers because of the name. I thought they were going to be severely overpriced. (Still kinda are but competitive)
I got the Our burger. It was nice and juicy. It's just their standard burger that comes with lettuce, tomato and onion and pickles with some type of special sauce. And boy it exceeded my expectations! 
Hubby got the BBQ bacon burger, it has BBQ sauce, avocado, bacon, lettuce and tomato. Hubby said that he thoroughly enjoyed it. 
The tater tots are nothing special. They are definitely crispy! 
Service was extremely fast. We ate in. We probably spent a total of 45 mins in this restaurant. That's how fast the service was! 
Wahlburgers definitely would get my business again!"}
{"text":"Have lived in Vegas for over 30 years and rarely go to strip. Our family loves to watch the Wahlburgers show, so for Sunday dinner we made our way to the Wahlburgers at Ballys, EVERYTHING was great from the food to the service, and the Grilled Banana Fluffanuta is amazing!!!
We definitely will be making more trips down to the strip  to eat at Wahlburgers!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Wahlburgers for lunch yesterday. We were so excited to go. My friend had the Thanksgiving Day sandwich which was to die for. I had the Paul burger which was good but not enough of Paul's sauce on it. The onion strings were very good and a shout out to Courtney for great service. 
So if you go either ask for more of Paul's sauce or get the Thanksgiving Day sandwich."}
{"text":"Would not return.  Ordered classic salad with grilled chicken. They forgot chicken.   Had  to ask twice for it. My friend said her burger was really good and my other friend enjoyed her portabello mushroom burger.  Mac and cheese tasted like cardboard.   Service just ok."}
{"text":"This is my go to place every time I'm in Vegas.  They have great dishes as well as sides. The BBQ bacon burger and mac N cheese is delicious! The food comes pretty quick and the service is great. Not to mention, the fast and efficient service from Rodrigo the bartender. He is kind, friendly and attentive. 

Overall, the food is excellent, good quality and large portions. This place is a MUST try."}
{"text":"Nope... didn't like it.  I expected something better.   Maybe it's all the hype that surrounds this place....??     I should've known better, but it is what it is...  In N Out is so much better.    And it's far too expensive.  $38 for a single burger, the sloppy joe, a side of fries and two sodas...  I didn't even get a drink!    Sorry Marky Mark.. this one's NO."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! Amazing burger & exceptional service. It was really crowded so I sat at the bar. Courtney waited on me & she was very attentive. I'll be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Wish these were in Texas because the Thanksgiving Day is my new fave sandwich. Sweet potato tots were delish. Time, and stomach space, didn't allow for testing of their alcohol-fueled milkshakes but next time for sure."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me here on Yelp knows I'm not
Big into giving bad reviews. So I'll go easy on this one. 

All I'm going to say is- if you have a show, and it's about how \"amazing your burgers are\" , to where you even incorporated your name into your product - it better be that damn good!! ....sorry folks...IT'S NOT! No- I don't watch the show. So I don't know the menu or the little inside scoop of the restaurant. 

Service was good. Our waitress very sweet & polite- but just to receive our beverages took forever & everyone seemed so overwhelmed with the crowd of patrons.  So unorganized. 

It could be a fun place, it's located in a great area in front of Bally's.  But with all first class, world renowned just steps away- you have to keep your \"A game\" up. The Burger was nothing to brag about & the fries/tater tots aren't anything special. From the bag to the fryer. Also when we asked \"what's the special sauce?..\" and the waitress starts saying -\"ketchup , Mayo...\" that's NO secret. That's thousand Island dressing base...McDonalds and the rest of America has been using that for decades!

Give me my Five Guys, BurgerFI, Shake Shack, etc, anyday!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food but maybe 3-4 for the restaurant itself. It's a bit small for as busy as they get. Considering their location, there isn't much that can be done except maybe relocate or open a second location in town. The food was phenomenal as was the service. I am a local here in Las Vegas. Most locals do not go to the strip often. I will be going back there soon! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Worst first impression ever. They were out of fruit for drinks, out of onion rings and served my food lukewarm. Unbelievable. I drove 30 miles for a mediocre meal. Last but not least, my peach sangria was served in a glass with lipstick on the rim that wasn't mine. Unbelievable. Left a message with management and still no follow up. I guess when you attach a famous name, customer service and quality food is unnecessary."}
{"text":"Too much hype around the name. Hospitality and food service low standard. Small burgers and fries are extra! Then you'll still go somewhere else to eat after cause your still hungry. Should of gone to Red Robin at least you get bottomless fries with a huge burger! That tastes good and cost less."}
{"text":"There was a wait to be seated so we decided to get it to go. Seating inside had a wait but outside tables are free for all. This place opened about 8 weeks prior. It seemed pretty constantly busy. I guess the walburg brothers opened up this spot. I was hoping to see him, but it's not happening tonight. Great investment on his part. 

I ordered a bacon burger with fries and my man for the melt. Food took about 20 minutes. My jalapeño bacon burger wasn't too bad. I give it a 3 star rating. The size could've been a bit bigger for $12 thought. 
Fries: 3 star. They weren't hot, and for $5 the portion size was just sad. Flavor was ok

The melt: 2.5 star. The meat in comparison to the bread was imbalanced. My man ended up just eating the meat without the bread. He asked for no onions, but there were tons of c onions inside. He just scraped them out since he was hungry.

Overal I give it a 2.75. Portion could be a bit larger for the prices in meat and fries. More than likely won't come back. Just tried it out and didn't impress."}
{"text":"Right now this is a rating for the bar, I will try a Wahlburger when the Palo Alto store opens. I 
came here after going to the Bellagio fountains and sat at the bar and watched NHL highlights at around 12 am.  .I sat there and played with my Rubiks cube. The bartenders were getting a kick of watching me solve it. I got one of the \"Adult shakes\". It was one that had Strawberry and Banana flavor for $13. The alcoholic component was some marshmallow vodka. It was very good. The next drink I tried was a Peach Boston Tea for $13 as well, and my last was an $8 pint of Angry Orchard cider. The bar was run that night by Richard, Courtney, and Almodovar. I was curious to whether that was really her first name, or if she chose that as a \"work name\" because she likes his films."}
{"text":"After months of waiting finally got to try the famous Wahlburgers..... unfortunately that will probably be my last visit.  I ordered the double stack our burger which was stated to be 1/2 lb,  which was at most a quarter pound with both patties combined. ..  I also ordered a side of sweet potato tater tots which came freezing cold and salted to the point they couldn't be eaten. ."}
{"text":"Boring concept, mediocre food & extremely over priced.  Wahlburgs should stick to acting.   Waited 45 minutes for this?  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"It was a fun atmosphere.  The burgers were creative.  I got the turkey burger with stuffing on it, I believe it was called something like the Thanksgiving Plate.  The flavor didn't pop quite as much as I was hoping for, but I still enjoyed it.  The sweet potato tots were pretty great!  All in all everything was good, especially for a reasonably priced quick meal on the strip, and I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas in March and just had to stop and try Wahlburgers.  There was a 45 minute wait but I was lucky enough to quickly get a stop in the bar.  I had the Double Decker with Tots.  It was a good burger.  No complaints.  At least I can say I've eaten at Wahlburgers!!!"}
{"text":"My friends kidnapped me for my bachelor party and took me here. I expected overpriced low quality food. However it was high quality and well priced. I got a burger it had fresh toppings and was packed full of flavor. The fries were also good, and we were given onion rings since we waited so long due to it being just open. The only down side was the frozen drink I got which was small for the price. The service was only point, but due to them being so busy it took awhile to get our food."}
{"text":"Went there Sun & 5PM there were at least 6 open tables outside. Host said at least 20 min wait. My party and at least 5 other just left. Horrible management, no reason people couldn't sit right away. Food? Who knows."}
{"text":"Honestly I visited this restaurant because I am a fan of the Wahlburgs.  I was pleasantly surprised to have one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  Cooked perfectly and the Wahlburg sauce is really good!  Don't miss the onion strings, fantastic!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with family I got the the melt and added a fried egg . Was super good came out fast . Then I got a strawberry mule it was delicious. I recommend eating here !!"}
{"text":"$40 for two burgers, fries, and Mac and cheese is pretty steep. But if the food is good it's always worth it. Wahlburgers just didn't do it for me. Burger was ok, but the fries and Mac and cheese were sub-par. Food wasn't terrible but nowhere near $40 dollars. Shake shack all day."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Wahlburgers and I ordered the OFD burger which sounds good in theory. I asked for it well done. My burger was not well done (neither were my family member's burgers) and it tasted like it hadn't been seasoned at all. I'm also not a fan of having to order the fries separate from the burger. It's very loud inside of this location. The Mac 'n' Cheese with bacon was pretty good. However, I don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Best cheeseburger I may have ever had. I wasn't expecting it to be that good. It was phenomenal. 
The mac salad was also good, basic but done well. I really enjoyed my meal here. If you're debating to eat here, do it!"}
{"text":"Hmm. Lot of hype for this place. I ordered a \"Your Burger\" which was around $10.95 with cheese. Side of fries was another $4-5 plus drink costs. I paid over $20 total which is a bit steep for a burger meal. I thought the burger was ok but nothing overly special. I still hold Gordon Ramsey burgr as the top spot for taste. Service was amicable and this is in the middle of the food area of Bally's outdoors."}
{"text":"had the Caesar salad with chicken it was probably the best salad I've ever had first time here nice restaurant nice environment definitely coming back for sure !!!"}
{"text":"Employees were super friendly and constantly checked on us. There was fans blowing cool air and mist outside at bar just what we needed in hot Vegas. Burgers were amazing perfectly cooked and came with cool to-go cup and were reasonably priced. Great place :)"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, food came out timely.  Nice fun environment!  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"When I found out that there is a Wahlburgers in Las Vegas, and knowing that I will be vacationing there soon, I knew I had to put this eatery on my 'to-do' list while in town. I didn't let the hot weather stop me from coming to this restaurants that's located outside Bally's Casino. I ordered The Beast Burger-- 2-5oz beef patties, \"government\"cheese, pulled pork bbq, onion, lettuce, tomato, and Wahlburgers sauce. That burger was bigger than anything I could shove in my mouth -- and so worth it! Flavors were really good. It did get messy. With the size of my burger, how could I expect it not to (eventually went to knife and fork mode to finish eating). Only minor drawback- the pulled pork was just a bit chewy. Other than that, loved the burger, loved the experience,  and the bartenders were on top of things and very friendly (I ate at the bar). Definitely gonna go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place awesome. Staff extremely friendly and food so good. I would definitely come back.."}
{"text":"We are on the hunt for the BEST BURGER in Toronto! Stop #6: Wahlburgers

Sometime in 2014 Mark, Donnie, and Paul Wahlburger expanded their burger shop exploit into Toronto. I have to say, I was skeptical. It's easy to toss a celebrity name on something (Trump University) then make tall claims. But hey, my friends wanted to go, so we went.

When you enter the restaurant you realize that 1) this is more than your run-of-the-mill burger stop, and 2) Marky Mark put a fair bit of that Ted 2 money to use here. There are two floors, a full bar, flat screens lining the walls, and some pretty nice decor. Think of it like a gourmet burger restaurant, where you can drink, and appreciate some shameless advertising of Mark's past theatrical works.

With an ever present skepticism, and on waitress recommendation, I ordered The Melt and a side of Sweet Potato Tots. First off, I'm not sure what kind of sweat shop they have in the kitchen, but damn do they bring out your order quickly. Now at this point I'm going to have to restrain my desire to use expletives to explain how in LOVE I am with these mother****ing sweet potato tots. You know that you've discovered something precious when on first bite you can't contain audible excitement. Like HOLY S***.
Anyway, after collecting myself I started on The Melt. On first glance, this looks like a fancy grilled cheese. Between their in-house made thick-cut bread is a beef patty, grilled government cheese, pickles, caramelized onions, bacon, and mustard sauce. What you get first is that beautifully buttered and toasted thick-cut bread. Then you proceed to dive into a cheesy and beefy comfort, that is reliably supported with bacon, and (somehow) more notably the caramelized onions. A really satisfying burger.

After all that, I was so happy with myself that I got Thanksgiving Day burger as well. Think of a turkey burger with the classic Thanksgiving Day toppings. And yes, that includes cranberry sauce. (Very good, but not the best they have.)

In conclusion, I have no problem admitting when I'm wrong. Wahlburger serves up some stellar burgers, a cool atmosphere, and the most God-the-f***-damn intoxicating tater tots you'll ever have. So how does Wahlburger rank on the burger hunt? It's coming out at a strong #2, tied with Holy Chuck, and right behind Toma."}
{"text":"Really 2.5. 
Not judging on the atmosphere, as it's a chain and these people have no say. But customer service is key. Which unfortunately was somewhat lacking. We witnessed two other parties having issues at the same time as us, so maybe just a bad night? The server did slightly try to make it right, but with so many mishaps, the experience was kind of swayed. Wrong beer. Wrong burger. Dead house, long wait. No compensation on the bill for said mishaps. Maybe will try a different location or a later date. Chin up."}
{"text":"We showed up here around Sunday at midnight and sat at the outside bar and watched the Olympics on the TV. We were quickly acknowledged and sparked up conversation with a guy who appeared to be a bar busser and then our waitress/bartender. 

The service was 5 stars but the cooks/kitchen staff can't read the order right (-1 star, forgot my bacon and side of ranch) and the food was cold when we received it (-1 star). Was really surprised that the burger was cold because it didn't take tremendous time to get our food. Another frustrating thing was the machines that blow air between open areas. It was a constant struggle to keep things on the counter when the air was blowing directly at us/the food.  

I really wanted a lettuce-wrapped burger but they can't accommodate because their lettuce is shredded."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to come here,  and so glad I did,  it was me and my twin sister birthday done picked this place for our family dinner,  it was such a good time and great food  I went to one in Myrtle Beach back in March and loved it so I couldn't wait to go to the Pittsburgh North hills location,  our server jess was very nice the whole staff there was friendly,  will definitely return"}
{"text":"It was very good! I had their \"our burger\" and it was very tasty. I also had the onion rings and they were awesome. Definitely would recommend to anyone! Very fast take out service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This WAHLBURGERS was very mediocre, especially when comparing to the one I've been to in Palo Alto. It was dirty, the service wasn't great, their drink menu was really limited in comparison to the other location. 

I had a cocktail that was so weak it was laughable. Not sure there was alcohol in it, to be honest. The burger was pretty good, I was starving so I wasn't picky. The sweet potato tots were pretty good too. 

Overall, it was ok. But with Burger Brasserie and BurGR in walking distance they need to pick it up. 

\"Maak, Dorney and Pwual\" need to look into the management of this place.

3 stars."}
{"text":"We were pretty excited about eating here, and we were promptly provided with a dirty table. After another table was seated next to us, we asked for a menu and the waiter noticed the table was still dirty. So he promptly took the order of the other table and got them their drinks.  At that point, eating at this restaurant for the first time ever was no longer important.

We left and they made no attempt to apologize."}
{"text":"It's not worth the money.  The burgers are ok, not amazing.  The Alma's Mac salad was extremely dry and the fries are just fries.  All this hype for what...terrible service and ok good."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my boyfriend.  I was shocked that the restaurant was not busy at all. To be fair, it's FREEZING outside, so most people do not want to venture too far away from home. 

We walked in, and were promptly seated. Unfortunately, It took forever before someone came over to take our drink order (which is weird because as I said before they were not busy at all).  The burgers were good. I really enjoyed the sweet potato tater tots, did not like the french fries.
 
Overall, I would eat there again if I was in the area, but I would not make a special trip to go there and eat.

Edited to add:  the prices were VERY reasonable, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch with a friend visiting Vegas.  She watches the awful tv show and begged we go here after trying to avoid this place due to what i already knew would happen happened.   

Overpriced, commercial as hell burger. Bland taste, not impressed at all.  The bartender was very nice and the Coronas were good.  Ordered the onions rings and they were okay. Nothing to write home about.  2 burgers one onion ring order and 2 beers $40 before tip and tax. 

With in and out and shake shack out here and for a third of the price don't bother with this celebrity spot.  Not great food.  Expensive as hell.  

First and last time.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Last time we were in Vegas we missed the opening by a few days.  We had to try it this visit. The food was excellent and Miguel was awesome. He made us feel at home and treated us to sweet potato bites and an awesome banana marshmallow dessert. The staff was friendly and the restaurant super clean. The only thing that could have enhanced my experience was if Mark served my sloppy joe plate in his Calvin Klines!"}
{"text":"Since we have been in Vegas this past Friday, the two best attitudes we have encountered have been here at Wahlburgers!! Liz, the bartender was super awesome and ON POINT. She served us with a smile even though my pregnant spouse and I opted to not drink!! Keep up the good work guys and Liz, DON'T CHANGE!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the hype. I got the bbq burger and was expecting a big burger covered in bbq sauce. But nope. Just a tiny little burger, with basically no sauce on it. The cheese wasn't even slightly melted, it was actually on the cold side. Our bartender was terrible. Barely gave us any attention even when we tried waving her down. My boyfriend also got the bbq burger and they cooked his burger wrong. All in all it wasn't worth it. As a local I'd rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Maybe my first Wahlburger should not have been in an airport. But because it was, I lowered my expectations. The burger was well done and rather dry. I'm glad I ordered the bacon and BBQ toppings. The menu said it came with avocados but it was a spread, more like guacamole. The onion rings were what we would call onion straws - very thin, but well seasoned. Our service was friendly and prompt.  Overall, for a quick airport meal, it was not bad but otherwise not memorable."}
{"text":"Before I start this review, a small disclaimer.  This is a review for the restaurant just after it opened and this is for the smaller Las Vegas location outside of Bally's.

I want to like this place.  Hell, I want to love it!  I am originally from the Boston area, I have watched the show from the beginning and I love the concept of the Wahlberg family starting their own burger chain.  That being said, we didn't have a great experience here even though we were really excited to try it out.  When we got there, it was fairly late so there was only one couple walking in, in front of us.  We thought, great...   no line when we were expecting one.  We sat at the bar area.  There were people walking here and there doing behind-the-bar things and saw us sitting there, but they literally chose to ignore us.  I don't know if it was the timing of our visit or they had had a long day or what, but I always give servers and/or bartenders the benefit of the doubt.

We had to have been sitting there for 15 mins. or more before we stood up and had to find a copy of their menu that was sitting down the bar.   This prompted one of them to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered a couple of beers and thought that would be the start of good service.  Nope.  We sat waiting until we finished our beers (another 15 mins. or more) before anyone came back over to ask if we wanted food.  We finally were able to order and our burgers did come out pretty fast.  Too fast it seems, as our burgers were both very rare although we ordered medium.  We were too hungry at this point - and frankly a little scared to complain - to send them back for more firing.

Again, I want to love this place and I am a very easy-going, benefit-of-the-doubt, Elite Yelper who doesn't like to complain but this type of service was really bad.  I am sure this restaurant wouldn't hire employees who simply didn't care or didn't know how to cook so I have to chalk this one up to bad time, or employees at the end of their shift who have had a long, tiring day.


The Good:

Cool restaurant design
Wahlberg name
Okay beer selection
Great food presentation


The Bad:

Wait time
Customer service
Food not cooked to order

The Ugly:

Location (among cheap shops in front of Bally's casino)
Rare burger meat when asked for Medium"}
{"text":"If you want overpriced burgers, have I got the place for you!  This was such a disappointment, I had the veggie burger on a lettuce wrap, everything fell apart and I ended up eating it with utensils because it wasn't in any shape to be a handheld meal.  I can't believe I paid $12 bucks and waited 20 minutes in the takeout line for the privilege of having goop drip all over me.  It should have been served in a cup at that point."}
{"text":"The hostess was also our waitress and she was ON TOP OF IT! It was a very busy Saturday afternoon but she was checking in on us at all the right moments, refilled our drinks constantly, and had any little request handled fast! The food was also great - everything we ordered was delicious! The only downside was that the hamburger buns got mushy VERY easily, but it didn't take away from the overall taste (just made things a bit messier). I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Great burger , did the trick . Big open bar lots of space . Friendly staff . In and out . Got the organic beer which was fresh! The 'our burger' was solid and good flavour ."}
{"text":"Burgers were great. I had the Donnie's favorite BBQ burger. My husband had The Melt. 
He thought his was just ok basically because it sounded like a grilled cheese but it was not. 
I recommend trying this place. It is a little loud, and draft beers were way too pricey. Stick with the cans of beer they are much cheaper."}
{"text":"I have been really looking forward to going to Wahlburgers since I found out Las Vegas was getting one. We finally made it down their this last week. I expected a long line but we were able to sit right away at the bar. 

My husband and I had never been so we wanted to look over the drink menu. The moment our butts hit the seat the bartender asked what we wanted to drink. We asked her for a moment, a minute barely passed and she was back. So we both rush and just order not wanting to keep being rushed. This was the first annoying thing. We wanted to see all the cool drinks they might have but she didn't give us a chance to read the menu. 

Once we order the drinks we turn our attention to the food menu. Again, wanting to look over all the specialty burgers and such. Barely getting threw 3 burgers she asks if we are ready to order. We ask her for a few more minutes. She comes back with our drinks and waters and asks again. Again a minute pasted... maybe. So we just ordered the first thing we saw. 

This was disappointing. We were being rushed, from the moment we sat down to the moment we officially ordered it had been maybe 4 minutes and this is with turning her down a few times. 

The food came and it was pretty good. The bartender checked up on us and asked about refills. When we finished we got the check and was shocked at the prices. The beer was so expensive and apparently fries don't come with your $14 burger. The food was good but the experience was bad and the price was way to high for the food quality. I don't plan on ever going back. 

There are so many other burger places along the strip for better prices or a better environment."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us for a \"Sweet 16\" aka 60th. The food was - well let's say my sister is from NJ and all 4 of us thought these were the best burgers. We had \"the melt\" it was incredible. The staff is lovely. It was packed and they treated us like we were their favourite table. It seemed they treat all tables like that. They also sang happy bday to me with a candle in the most delicious dark ice cream. Walburgers MUST come to Ottawa."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting a Wahlburgers.  Our server, Jill, recognized we weren't comfortable in a booth and suggested we move to a table.  Her service was quick, she was very bubbly and made suggestions from the menu.  Because of that, my husband changed his mind and was very pleased.  We didn't have to wait for refills and all food came out quickly.  You will be lucky to have her as your server."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying that I am not a hater. I have been looking forward to Wahlburger's for years and even tried to rearrange a flight so that I could layover in Boston to check them out.  The reality is the burgers just aren't great. They are OK and this is Las Vegas where your game has to be stepped up a bit to command your presence on the Strip.  I wanted to be impressed, hell I wanted to stay for dessert but I just couldn't be bothered. Ouch."}
{"text":"I went in at about 10 at night. I had low expectations based on the reviews I had read. There were a few tables occupied. I wasn't there for the ambiance, it would never match the TV show, I was after takeout. 

I ordered the \"Our Burger\" figuring that if that's the one Paul likes it's the way he intended it to be. Ordered some tater tots and some onion rings. Almost $20 later and about 5 minutes for my food to come up, I headed back to my hotel. 

When I got there I was pleasantly surprised. The burger was really good. The meat was moist, the paddy was thick, and all the toppings could be tasted. It was well put together. . The tater tots were tater tots. A little less greasy than the ones from my childhood with crunch and a nice taste. The onion rings were a disappointment. They are onion threads, something that you would recognise as a topping for a steak. The flavour was okay, but one bite was enough. 

Would I go back, sure, the burger is good and I enjoyed it. Next time I am in Boston I will make the pilgrimage to the original."}
{"text":"It's a tourist trap restaurant in a city overflowing with a multitude of burger chain restaurants.

Burger tastes good but poor value :("}
{"text":"Awesome addition to the strip!  Who needs shake shack now that the wahlburg brothers have opened up their Las Vegas outlet right in front of Ballys.  This place is awesome!  If you have had burgers from back east this place takes the crown.  Great family burgers, fries, sides, salads, other sandwiches and frappes (shakes) and floats!  

Everything is fresh and damn good!  They have a rep to protect and even during mock training this place rocked on service and good quality!!!  Once they start the engine going this place will rock and be one of the best additions to sin city's burger wars.  Move over shake, Ramsey, fufu waffle & gimmicky burgers - the kings have arrived!  Awesome meat, shredded lettuce, house made pickles, and this awesome Chef Paul's signature wahl sauce.  Guaranteed good stuff.  They are gonna turn on west coasters to their east coast good food and hospitality.  This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Fresh burgers - sweet potato tots are delicious! We had \"The Melt\" and dads burger. Both were excellent. By the way, the artisan bun on the regular burger was awesome. Oh and the pickles? I almost asked for more. So glad we finally tried this place. Both the food and service were great."}
{"text":"Very disappointed food was below average 
Service was great (only reason for 2 stars)
Burger = below average 
Hot dog = awful
Milk shake = McDonald's 
This place will not last long not even in same category as Burgatory
I would put it below steak n shake and 5 Guys way below them"}
{"text":"Like many other people, I love watching there show, so yes, this was one place that was a \"must\" when going to Vegas, I was so happy when they opened there location right out side of Bally's.  You have the option to sit outside, at the bar or inside of the resturant.  When we arrived we were offered the outside high rise table, we asked for a table inside, and we were lucky, no wait, seated within one minute. Good timing. We went this past Friday evening, when we left they had a huge line. 
We started off and ordered off there WOHLCOCTIONs menu-
We ordered 2 Pina Colada's- made with cruzan coconut rum, island oasis pina colada, whipped cream, topped with a fresh pineapple and a pretty flower.  Full of flavor , and perfect amount of liquor ratio to the drink. $10 each
From the menu-
Husband ordered- double dogs- 2 all beef hot dogs, choose your toppings ( yellow mustard, spicy brown mustard, housemade mustard, ketchup, sriracha, relish, saurakraurt, raw onions) $9.95
I ordered-Marks Favorite \"Thanksgiving Day Sandwich\" freshground seasoned turkey burger, stuffing, mayo, homemade orange-cranberry sauce & roasted butternut squash (I chose to omit the squash) $11.95
 We shared a side order of tater tots

Service was excellent, food came out hot, and delicious. Happy we tried Wahlburgers. If your on the strip, I would recommend, they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"I watch this TV show, so of course I wanted to try this place while in Vegas.  We arrived at about 12:45 p.m.  they had a hostess outside taking names on their iPad.  Our wait was about 5-10 minutes for a party of two.  They are located in front of Bally's casino.  They have bar, indoor and outdoor seating.  When submitting our name for the waitlist, they ask what your seating preference is.  We asked for first available.  Our seat was outside next to the railing.  Downfall of this is people waiting for a seat lean on the railing overlooking the table.  Not cool while you are eating and conversing with your company.  It was a lil chilly too.  They had heaters outside, but those seated on the railing didn't get any heat.  That aside I ordered the Paul Fav burger.  Which is called the \"our burger\" on the menu.  The burger is very good.  They make their own pickles and I liked the flavor of them on the burger.   The cheese is \"government\" cheese which is what they grew up eating.  If you don't know what that  is, well that just means you weren't poor growing up.  I, on the other hand, knew exactly what kind of cheese they put on their burgers.  Burgers automatically have cheese and if you don't want to pay the extra price then you have to specify \"no cheese\" otherwise you'll get cheese.  Paul's special sauce is delicious.  The burger is well put together and fresh!  Everything is al a carte so you'll have to pay for fries, tots, onion rings, etc.  burger was $10.99 each and one order of fries was $4 ish.  We shared an ordered and it was plenty for sharing.  Fries were ok, nothing to write home about, but still good and not greasy.  We ordered Diet Coke $5 each which comes in a nice Vegas souvenir cup.  Overall, I liked my experience and would recommend Wahlburgers!"}
{"text":"My friends insisted we stop by and eat lunch because they are huge fans of the show. The food wasn't bad, it was what it was; burgers and tater tots. My burger was properly cooked and seasoned, but didn't really seem to be anything special. tater tots are exactly as I remember them from my school cafeteria. I had a milkshake which is good, but again it's was a normal milkshake. The truffle cookies we're probably my favorite thing that I ate. We went to the back counter to order and I have to say the service was pretty rough. The woman that took our order got it wrong twice while typing it in, once she got it right it was about a 15 minute to 20 minute wait for our food. It may have just been who took our order because other customers seemed to be getting out much quicker. My biggest issue is this was glorified fast food that cost just over 40 bucks for two people. I wouldn't go back purely based on the cost to quality ratio, but the food is exactly as you expect it to be make your decision of that I suppose."}
{"text":"Not a place I will crave or come again on my own dime. The burger is small and pricey $11.50 for a burger. I ordered the burger salad option and it was drenched in dressing. Two bites of it I realize I can't keep eating this salad and asked for them to refire. They ended up taking the burger out and giving me new greens. The salad is small so you need to order a side of fries to keep you fulfilled. The sides are around $5.00. Basically itis a $20 meal. Way over priced.

The sweet potatoes tots were nice though. Came out piping hot. Service was great at the bar."}
{"text":"Had a great waitress named Ashley. She recommended menu items and talked my friend into a drink that he stated was extremely refreshing that he never would have ordered. 

Unfortunately, thing crashed quickly to mediocre when the food came. It was good, but nothing special for sure. 

Way over priced for what you get (every thing is a-la-carte). Come only to say you have been there and then never look back."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited to finally try wahlburgers and i purposely waited for the hype to die down because i hate long lines for food.

We ended up there before an Browns game and it ended up being packed. End of August the weather was still a bit warm, inside was nice and air conditioned but we ended up sitting in the back outside of the bar. BIG mistake. I thought i was gonna die of overheating. Not sure why they had an outside bar area and didnt think to put some fans out there for circulation jesus. Even the poor bartender was sweating bullets, her shirt literally soaked. She was nice through it all though, however, the way the bar is situated it had seats on the end near where the other waiters/waitresses do the checks and you can overhear the horrid conversations some of the staff have. For example, on this particular day, they were getting packed and this waitress with blonde hair and some tatts was blatantly saying \" i wish these f*king people would leave my table i cant deal with them anymore\" and then she started talking about her fellow employees to another employee and they were very rude and open about it. The manager needs to address her ASAP.

ANyway on to the food.

The burger, i ended up getting a fiesta burger medium well and some onion rings.
The burger was a little on the rare side for me, i purposely asked for medium well but they fell short on the mark. The burger was decent, a bit sloppy for me, the bun got soggy from the salsa, the cheese wasnt fully melted it was kind of a slop. The onion rings were the highlight, a single order is enough to feed two, and it comes with this awesome dipping sauce. We were engaged with some hand crafted beer from local brewerys which was awesome because now i have a new beer to guzzle lol. The waitress again was nothing short of awesome, despite her burning behind the bar she maintained a smile and did her job perfect.

A couple of things for the owners/manager:

If your staff isnt happy theres a quick fix, find new staff. Get fans for the outdoor bar area because newsflash if they are sitting outside its most likely summertime. Teach your cooks the difference between rare and cooked because thats a health code violation waiting to happen and PLEASE consider your seating arrangements. it was a bit tight in the actual inside dining area, almost impossible to pass people."}
{"text":"I have no idea where bad reviews come from for this place. I have been dying to eat here since they opened and I am NOT disappointed. The food is AMAZING! I had Mark's fave. My bf had Donnie's. Both were delicious. The service was great too. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very pleasant and attentive. We will definitely be making this a regular spot to come. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Took the family here for a quick lunch. I got a bacon burger that was average but tiny. 5 bites and it was gone. And if they ask if you would like fries or tots you find out on the bill that it cost an extra $5 per side (that  is for 8 tater tots). My son and daughter both had chicken tenders they were dry and the waiter offered nothing but ketchup to put on them it also tasted like the fryer grease has not been cleaned since they opened. It leaves a weird aftertaste in your mouth.
We ordered drinks too and had them gone immediately but we were never offered any refills. The menu said they had a burger of the day but when I inquired about it the waiter said the restaurant didn't do specials and was rather snippy about it. 
This place had a fast food feel and taste but a price tag of something much more. If your in the mood for a burger in Vegas avoid this place and your sure to find something better just down the road."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to eating at a Wahlburgers for a few years now. Finally got a chance while here on vacation in vegas. I really liked their system to get a table. We had about a 45 minute wait and I received a text when the table was ready. I had the basic burger with Swiss cheese and a side of fries and a soda. I was not disappointed. The burger was great the fries were great. Service was ok, nothing outstanding. Only thing was the prices. Definitely on the high end for a made to order burger. And 4.95 for a rather small portion of fries. Overall though I really liked my meal and it's a place I would return to, just not as frequent because of the prices"}
{"text":"The burger was amazing. However, the tater tots weren't anything special. They taste like typical tater tots you would get at a cafeteria. Also, for an extra $4, the tater tots weren't worth the price, save your money. Also, there was not enough staff on hand, so service is not that fast/you never see your server."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty bad. They ran out of buns, so I had ordered just tots instead. This is fine, these things happen, but then they told me that buns are now restocked and I decided to order the BBQ bacon cheeseburger, and the burger came on cibatta bread, which definitely was not their standard bun. the bread was cold as well...My water which I had ordered with my tots, took over 10 minutes to be delivered, I had to ask another customer to use their condiments...not only that, but when it came time to pay my check, I had to wait another 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Meh. A friend and I split an Our Burger, a Thanksgiving burger, and an order of Mac and cheese. The food was definitely just \"okay.\" Definitely inflated pricing; I could go to Bachi Burger or Fukuburger, and get a much, much better burger for the same price, or less. I would not drive to the strip and deal with parking just to eat here, but if I were already on the strip, and Bobby's Burger Palace and Holstein's were both closed, and there was zero wait, I would come eat here again. 

The Our Burger tasted like what a I remember a Big Mac to taste like, the bun was very soggy and it pretty much fell apart. Also, we asked for something to cut the burgers in half, but never for a knife so we used a  plastic spoon to half it, which probably didn't help. 

The Thanksgiving burger was okay. It was a little bland, needed more acidity in the cranberry sauce maybe? Wouldn't order again. 

Best part of the Mac and cheese was the bacon; otherwise it was on the watery side and also a little bland. Definitely not worth $8.95"}
{"text":"Ok, so name brand recognition drew us in. We had to see what this place was all about, I mean who wouldn't?!!! Yes I love Mark Wahlburg  

They offer seating at the bar which extends outdoors or table seating inside. Too bad it was freezing because it would have been nice to be outside. We were greeted by a really nice bartender. It was her very first day and you could totally tell. She wasnt very knowledgeable with the types of alcohol they served, the menu or how to make a drink (as we could see by the use of her using a drink book). So you might think our service was bad or slow...but it really wasn't. She let us know she was new so I guess inadvertently we subconsciously gave her some slack. Either way, she was extremely nice, attentive and kept us informed with everything going on (at the times things were moving a little slow). 

We started with a few drinks then enjoyed the ourburger cooked medium and the sweet potato tots with a side of cheese. The burger was cooked to perfection, I'm not a big burger lover but I gotta admit this was a good burger! The sweet potato tots..yum!!!"}
{"text":"I can only give a recommendation. Be prepared for a long wait. We attempted to go, but it was an hour and twenty minute wait. We decided to move on."}
{"text":"Im so glad Wahlburgers are finally in Pittsburgh Pa! Hope they open more in our Area! I had lunch at their Boston restaurant and tell you what was great Their thanksgiving Day burger its a killer! Their onion rings& Almas Macaroni Salad reminded me if my Aunts family picnic one. I would hope Donnie or Mark walk through door! You'll be satisfied eating here there portions are huge!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar Saturday morning.  The service was quick. Our drinks were refilled frequently by Emma, the bartender.  Our food was delivered faster than expected.  The restaurant and bar were full by 11:30.  The bun was fresh and the hamburger was good as well as the tots.  We will be coming back once a month."}
{"text":"Amazing crazy delicious! Got the melt. The burger itself was so tender and flavor. The fresh dill pickles that are made daily were AWESOME! The best burger I have eaten in a long long time. The servers were so fast and friendly too. Definitely a do again."}
{"text":"I came here with low expectations. I mean it's owned by stars and their family. How many times have you seen this type of situation fail. Well let me tell you I was wrong. My hubby and I both ordered the original burger. What sold me was the description of \"government cheese\". Seriously this brings back memories of being poor and eating that  hunk of cheese like it was gourmet. So the burger comes and it's nothing fancy, but the patty looks like something your mama made with her hands with the 70% meat 30% fat that she got from the butcher.  It was so damn good. Nothing fancy nothing special but just a damn good burger. So if you are coming here looking for some gourmet stuff don't even bother. If you're coming here looking for an OG burger then this is your spot."}
{"text":"Clean, attentive, fast & friendly.

I ordered the \"our burger\" cooked medium. It could have used more sauce maybe? My fiancé ordered \"Jenn's Chicken Sandwich\" with our tater tots & Yukon golden fries. Tots were a way better choice than the fries."}
{"text":"Best dam burger on the Vegas strip, a little pricey but well worth it. The service is impeccable fast, friendly and polite. There is a wait on Friday and Saturday so get there early or just be prepared for a little wait. The food is sooo good especially the tater tots!!"}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before I came.  I had a chopped salad and the burger on top was cold.  It was also not cooked to my liking.  I was really looking forward to having a great dinner.  Oh, well. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Brittany, is amazing. She was very helpful!! I would recommend stopping by and getting a refreshing drink from Brittany."}
{"text":"What a disappointment, should have read the reviews before going.  We had a chicken sandwich, one order of fries, burger, and 2 diet Cokes--$38.00!  A bit pricey for what you get.  The burger was supposed to be 1/3 pound, seemed a bit short on the ounces.  Since my companion has been in the fast food business for most of his life, he knows if something isn't what it claims to be.  There was a wait for a table, but we chose to eat at the bar.  The server was great, although the kitchen didn't seem to understand \"no onions\" on my chicken sandwich.  Had to scrape them off.  Place may be okay for tourists, but for locals it will be one and done, if they even try it. Plus it's hidden and not easy to find."}
{"text":"Burgers are great. Fries are good. Sweet potato tots are awesome. Service just awful. The service is gonna ruin this place for a lot of people before it even takes off. Service is slow and the bartenders have very little knowledge of the products here to top with a lack of \"service industry common sense.\"  Common sense such as providing silverware, ketchup, and remembering your glass of wine... oh and knowledge of the \"Wahlbrewski\" such as what the ABV of it is. Hoping for improvements with their grand opening because the burgers are really great. They also need to fix the stocking issues as well they've been out of the \"marks favorite\" turkey burger both times we've been here."}
{"text":"My family and I went and it was exactly what we thought. I put a 4 because I wish there was a bit more space and bathrooms.

The food was great. We had the melt, our burger and the thanksgiving burger, Tator tots, sweet potato tots and onion strings. I am still craving those onion strings they were perfect.

Atmosphere was awesome.... Our waiter was cool, perfect for the job. The restaurant I looks great, we loved the decorations. If you're a fan of foods and the Wahlburg family then it tells their story for sure and you'll love it.

I have read reviews about comparison to In and Out or five guys, it's not fair. These are not meant to be plain Jane burgers. I will go back before I leave."}
{"text":"Juicy and flavorful burger, hot dogs were also very good.  I would order both again.  Loved the garlic mayo sauce, it's great for dipping the fries!  They also have IBC root beer which is my favorite.  Love that they support Peace Love and little Donuts.  Great service too!  Everyone is so nice."}
{"text":"1st Time here last time here. Sat down at the bar on Monday 5/21/18 and waited 30mins and counting for my food. The other people sat down next to me got food ate and finish the bar tender did offer us a free drink but that's besides the point. The bar tender gave us a drink but we still dint have food and it's been 40 mins at this point I don't even want to eat."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try Wahlburgers.  I was very disappointed with the food and service. First of all, the waitress (who im pretty sure was a manager) didn't really have time to take our order, and s he didn't even come around to our table and just talked to us from the opposite side of our table which was the entrance so she wasn't too interested in giving us any suggestions and she seemed afraid and pretty annoyed to have to serve  us.  I neglected to tell her that wanted a gluten free bun so i quickly got up to go tell her. She was very annoyed by my request but she went around and told the cooks then came back out but ignored me. I asked \"will that be ok\" and she just walked by me, didn't look at me, and said \"yeah\".  I guess someone needs a break.  The entire staff seemed to be off in general., non attentive or friendly   When we finally received our food it was cold. We ordered Paul's favorite burgers, tater tots and fries. Everything was cold and the burgers didn't even have the secret sauce or enough government cheese. Big disappointment.... don't recommend.... won't be back."}
{"text":"O.F.D. Originally from \"Dorchestah\" $12.95
(1/2 lb. burger, Swiss cheese, bacon, sautéed mushrooms & housemade tomato jam)

DAD'S BASIC BURGER $9.95
(1/3 lb. burger, onions, Paul's signature Wahl sauce & housemade pickles)

Tater Tots $4.95

Vanilla Milkshake $7.95

My wife and I came here for lunch after some walking around Bellagio and ending up at the Bally Shops. I wanted to really say its great but it was overall subpar. My wife and I agreed that the food tasted good. However, nothing really stood out in terms of flavor or experience.  Even though its new and clean, I can't say I'll be back. The food is too overpriced. Our bill came out to about $38.  I know its on the strip but there are way more alternative places to eat with better deals."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, and burgers are flavorful, pure beef. Fresh taste, sweet kind of bun, and the sauce they have in their burgers, are similar to in n out, without the relish. The burgers are pricey, $10-12 for just a burger. Fries are separate. Definitely, a must try, since it's \"Wahlburgers\", recommend this place if your curious about the hype."}
{"text":"We were headed to visit a friend at Fuel bar across from Wahlburgers and decided to stop and grab some food. I had the Thanksgiving Day sandwich/burger which was awesome! It's hard to make a turkey burger take on so much flavor and it was one of the best I've had. Boyfriend had Donnie's favorite burger and enjoyed that. We split fries, onion strings, and tots which were all amazing. We're locals so the price was not really shocking but not something we like paying for two burgers and a couple sides.  Hey, it's Vegas, if you don't have a vehicle, it's one of the best burgers on the strip!"}
{"text":"As a business traveller I like dropping in here for breakfast before flying.

We got the same friendly server the two times I've flown recently which is a refreshing change.

The food is decent (breakfast sandwich was great) as are the omelettes and the fruit  bowl was fresh grapes, blueberries, and strawberries.  Yes it's ridiculously expensive but so is everything else at the airport so just deal with it."}
{"text":"Meh...it is mediocre at very best. 45 minute wait to get seated, another 45 until you get your food. The food is ok. Just okay. For three kids meals and two burgers it was $60 before tip. You can get way better burgers at in-n-out or shake shack. I guess everyone will go once though. Would have made it better if there was a Mark sighting."}
{"text":"Pretty cool, but I was expecting more of a Shake Shack type experience. Didn't meet expectations because of the quality of meat and food in general: above average, but not stellar. And given all the hype, stellar was what I had come to expect."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try out this place after having watched the TV show. Stop by for lunch and had The Our Burger with some fries. The burger was nothing special, it was good but didn't wow me. I think it was rather small or maybe I had a big appetite. They do have some salads and cupcakes that looked delicious but didn't try them. They have a lot of workers but don't seem organized, it was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ bacon burger and we shared tots and onion rings which I threw into my burger to make like a western.  Burger was good, had it medium.  Burger is on the softer side.  Loved it.   Fries were crispy and slightly battered like a Burger King fry."}
{"text":"Went here with the family and the food along with the service was amazing!! Such a fun atmosphere and Brittany was especially great! Highly recommend this place if you're coming to vegas! Make sure to stop and get a T-shirt too!"}
{"text":"Very disapointing. Burger too small covered by a huge bun. Overpriced! Would rather have in-n-out. Affordable & good. Will not return. Onion rings were terrible."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite before catching an Uber and heading to our hotel. I wasn't thrilled to wait for a table because I was hangry, but time went by pretty quickly and we were soon seated. The burger (Paul's favorite on the menu) my wife and I split was really good. We also ordered a side of sweet potato tots, which were excellent. The atmosphere was also great. It didn't hurt that the place was plastered with Mark Wahlberg, who is definitely my wife's actor crush. You definitely felt welcome there, as the place felt homey (has the aesthetic of an urban garage) and our waiter was very nice and attentive. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my meal at Wahlburgers!! I went with no expectations and my experience at Wahlburgers was a 10 out of 10. The food was amazing. Hamburgers are not my favorite food ... but the hamburger I had was delicious. The sides were good but not anything extraordinary. Next time, I would go get a hamburger and tots and call it good. The service was also amazing. It made my experience there that much better. I would suggest to anyone and everyone to go try Wahlburgers !"}
{"text":"Airport food is usually overpriced and low quality. I accepted that reality when I sat down at Wahlbugers. I was pleasantly surprised.

I ordered the regular burger whatever it was called. The 1/3 lb cheeseburger. It was fresh and juicy and cooked perfectly. Paul's secret sauce is another varient of thousand island dressing or McD's secret sauce. It cost $10. Normally this would be high. At an airport it is not outrageous, sadly. 

I also order the onion rings. They were overpriced at $4. I expected big rings like A&W. It was a shredded pile of shoestrings. Lots of batter and salt. Not a lot of onion. It looked like mock calamari to be honest. 

Sam Adams is on tap. 

Overall, a solid burger prior to a flight. The restaurant was relatively clean. The service was good."}
{"text":"Great food! My daughter took me to lunch for my birthday we had maybe a 5 min wait or so. Waitress was nice got out drink and food quick.  Definitely going back to try the other buyers in menu. A lil pricey but that's expected on the strip."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to visit and had planned on it a long long time ago if we were to go visit where I grew up in southern New Hampshire we would go to the one in Boston area. I grew up with The New Kids on the Block and Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. Then it was announced that this was opening up in the area and made plans to come eat at Wahlburgers. We had a little bit of a wait but we knew we would with the specialness of the place and how new it was. We got seated at a booth but it was too tight for me and the wife so we asked for a different table and were moved without hesitation. We ordered and waited and we got our order it looked really good. But my son who is picky saw black specs on his hot dog tweaked and wanted something else. Waitress got him something else and seemed like she didn't mind and cared that he wasn't happy. The burger was excellent however it was not gourmet. Price was not terrible and overall value was good. You have to expect with a famous co owners that it will be more about the experience of being there rather then just the food."}
{"text":"Going here was for nothing more than to fill my curiosity about Wahlburgers and it's legitimacy as one of the popular eateries. 

We were seated promptly and the staff was friendly and attentive.  

The food, however, was a disappointment.  The impossible burger was something that I could've skipped especially at around $19.  It was a bit off on flavor and doesn't live up to the hype.

This was before fries, which we did order and had to send back because they were cold and we asked for fresh ones.  With a drink everything came out to around $35.

So I figured out this is a tourist trap, where you go for nostalgia of going there, but get charged up the wazoo for the experience."}
{"text":"Let's preface this with the fact that burgers are not on the top of my favourite foods list.

Ordered the melt which is almost $11 without fries which cost another $3.50.
SO ordered the original upped to 8oz patty with tater tots.

Service is friendly and prompt.  We received our drinks timely and the food didn't take that long to come out.  some of the other reviews commented on small portions.  We found all the food tasty and the portions were a good size and more than filling for an average appetite.  The melt was a perfectly toasted bread sandwiching a juicy patty with american cheese (they call it government cheese), pickles, onions, and mustard.  The fries were perfectly crispy and the tater tots were equally crispy and tasty.

The bill was $40 before tip for 2 soft drinks, 2 burgers, and fries and tater tots.  Yes, seems a bit pricey but it is downtown pricing and it is Wahlburgers.  I would say the burgers are better than Burger Works but not nearly as good as Burgers Priest if you're looking for comparisons."}
{"text":"I propose a name change. This place should be called Mehburgers.  Apparently, while searching for \"government cheese\" to top their burgers, they forgot to pick up some seasoning. This was the BLANDEST piece of meat I've ever eaten and that includes those awful hotel banquet chicken meals. You know you've had them. I did my best to eat half because I paid damn near $16 for it and some fries. I should have just ordered the fries. At least they were good."}
{"text":"Burger joints are our favorite and we have been to most in the 216, 440 and 330.

One of the better burgers we have had in a while. Wife and I both had the house burger. Ingredients were high quality and very fresh. The bun was outstanding and the house made pickles were some of the best we have ever had.

Sides - fries were hearty, cooked perfectly and seasoned well. My only negative was we were not crazy about the onion rings. Just our preference, but we didn't care for stringy purple onions. The onions didn't have much taste and neither did the batter. 

Our children loved the mac and cheese and chicken fingers. 

Service was great and we received our food in a timely matter. Restaurant was very clean including the bathrooms. 

All in all, I would give our experience a 9.5 out of 10.

Will be going back."}
{"text":"I was torn between 2 & 3 stars due to really liking my meal. 

They have a fantastic veggie burger. 2 of us had it & agree it was delicious. 3 other really liked their burger. My husband said his was cold.

Here are the negatives:

Way overpriced. All burgers come with nothing. Most were about $13. However the veggie burger was $19!  Sides were $5 & were not as big as you would think for the price.  Soda is $5.

All drinks are served in disposable looking cups. I can't imagine all the garbage being created.

When we were there the service was a bit slow. It took awhile to get drinks, then awhile to place a food order, then about 45 more minutes to get the food.

So even though I enjoyed my meal. I can get equally good food for less elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Staff was awesome and so were the burgers.  What else do I need to say!
We went with a group of 8 and they were great giving us 2 booths next to each other.  We went on a Friday night and waited maybe 15 minutes.
Our group liked to eat burgers the week we were in Vegas.  These were, by far, the best burgers we had.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit overrated. I think the prices are a bit high for what you're getting. I wish you got more for your buck. We sat outside because we were going to a show and didn't have a whole lot of time to eat and seating in the inside had a 20-30 minute wait time. It took awhile for anybody to come greet us and get us drinks, which was pretty disappointing. When we finally got to order, we didn't have to wait too long to receive our food. I got the Thanksgiving Turkey Burger which was actually pretty delicious. I wasn't sure about the squash on it and it being a turkey burger, but I have no complaints about it except that it wasn't big enough! My boyfriend had the Mom's Sloppy Joe and he really enjoyed it. The onion rings and the sweet potato tots were pretty good too."}
{"text":"Marky Mark you did it again! I went to wahlburgers for the first time after watching the show. My servers name was Dakota and he did great! The quality of the food was outstanding! Thanks for your help Dakota!"}
{"text":"Just waited nearly 45 minutes for my food, only to watch everyone that came after us get served ahead of us. When I asked about our food, Ashley just shrugs and says she's not sure. After watching the 5th person after us get served, we got up to leave, at which point someone told us that our food would be right up. Well, that's too late; I'm at lunch, not out touring the city. What a waste
We will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Overrated. I must admit, I was disappointed. Upon arriving and seeing the restaurant packed, I was excited to try for my first time. It was an experience and the staff was very nice and helpful. Although, the flavors weren't there for burger nor their popular onion fries. Everything was freshly made but other than that, I won't be coming back - especially for the price!"}
{"text":"Marky Mark did not disappoint! We ordered the The Our Burger and the Sweet Potato Tots. The burgers were cooked exactly how we asked for them and tasted amazing. The tots we had were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, perfect! Service was also on point."}
{"text":"My friends and I came into Wahlburgers right before closing after being out clubbing. We had told one another earlier in the day we HAD to try this place. I guess 430 am is the best time to come because we didn't have to wait. Our waiter was so nice despite us coming in right before closing. I got the burger melt and it was amazing. We all decided Wahlburgers has the best burger hands down. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Went to whalburgers last Sunday in vegas. It was definitely a good place to go to. They were definitely busy busy, but the wait time was no issue it only took 5min to be seated , the waiter took our drink orders and came back for our orders when he dropped off the drinks and i swear we werent waiting but maybe.10 to 12 min. And our food was on the table. Awesome food. Only thing i would say is they definitely should try seasoning the patties,  but they were definitely still good, just needed some seasoning and it would be that final touch. 

Definitely cant wait to come back and eat here. They give u your soda drinks in a souvounier  cup for 4.95 but hey that was cool. It looks like u can ask for it in a regular  disposable cup if u wanted to but really why would u want that? I love my cup. 

This lady came to our table and took me and my husbands picture for something. Im guessing a board or something. Not sure but we didnt see her after that. She was going table to table so must of been something for the wall or something.  

It was a pleasant dinner, the cost is worth it its definitely not overpriced like everything else is on the strip. The staff was super friendly and thats always a plus. Everyone was smiling.  

Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"The OFD with Mustard sauce is by far one of the top 3 burgers I've ever had. Absolutely amazing. Didn't care for the onion rings so much but the frys were awesome. Absolutely a must eat"}
{"text":"My first Wahlburgers experience was a very pleasant one. I was thoroughly impressed with the entire staff -- friendly, attentive, the minimal wait time to be seated and of course, the incredible meal. I got The Our Burger with everything on it and the sweet potato tots.  Tried some of the onion straws, and those are amazing as well. I'll definitely be back for patio weather and I'm hoping they have a happy hour!"}
{"text":"Terminal 1, F concourse.  This place is open early and they even serve breakfast.  I've had the Originally from Dorchester at the original Wahlburgers in Hingham, Massachusetts and I have to say this one seems bigger and juicier than the one I remember from there.

On the menu the OFD is listed as being a 1/2 burger while most of the others are 1/3 pounders.  The juice/grease will drip a bit and the cheese was plentiful as were the mushrooms.

Having a burger and fries around 6 in the morning isn't what I'd normally eat for breakfast but hey if it's available as the entire menu is why not?

My wife went with the egg white and spinach omelette.   The fries are nothing special.  I remembered too late that the onions are really good.  I should have gotten those instead and put them on my burger.  

I haven't been to the Wahlburgers at the Soho Hotel, only this one at T1.  

The service seemed friendly and quick but it was very quiet as there were only a few patrons being so early in the morning."}
{"text":"Service couldnt have been worse.my friend and i ordered beer burger and fries.how much better could you want.the burgers were ordered both mefium.they were charred and tasteless
The fries were soggy and luke warm.npt good at all.i asked our server for management.nebere responded after 15 minuted."}
{"text":"Lots of empty tables but they won't seat anyone. They say the kitchen is too backed up. Decided to try it again. Bad idea. There were relatively few people here. But it still took half an hour for the food to come."}
{"text":"Just didn't have the quality food expected for the price, and the service was just way off par. My waitress talked to us maybe three times total and had to ask other waiters for help. Not impressed at all and as a local will not go there again willingly."}
{"text":"Well so glad I waited for this place to come to Cleveland. I skipped on Vegas Wahlburgers because they were coming to Cleveland. I was excited to finally go try it out and we were turned away at 9:50 on a Saturday night because the manager told them to turn people away.....hm I didn't even see a line outside and food lined up to be taken to tables. Screw this place. It will close down soon along with B spot and Rosie Roccos at casino"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Sunday on our recent Vegas trip. My husband is a huge fan of Mark Wahlberg so we were excited to check this place out. We sat at the bar and were greeted right away by the bartender who gave us excellent service the whole time. They have several big TV's around the bar, ideal for watching sports.

They have a signature \"Wahlbrewski\" beer on tap, so obviously we each had to try that. It was a  light brown ale, crisp & a touch of sweetness. Easy to drink, goes well with burgers.

My husband got the \"Our Burger\" (Paul's favorite) - a classic cheeseburger and I got the portobello sandwich as a chopped salad bowl (you can get any of their burgers/sandwiches chopped up and tossed with mixed greens for no extra cost - I love having this option!). All of the toppings on both of our orders were fresh and plentiful. We also got a side of the thin crispy onion rings - so thin & yummy! We both really enjoyed our meals!

Pricing is a little high, but I expect that for a restaurant on the Vegas strip, and we really enjoyed our experience, so that makes it worth it for me!"}
{"text":"Terrible price for just a hamburger $14+nothing with it. Service terrible people who work there either don't care or not friendly. Hat worn backwards or to the side looks awful. Nice job Wahlburgers"}
{"text":"The servers are perfectly cheeky. I got a free shake for their mess up which I loved and you can take home the cups which are pretty nice. I was pleased with their atmosphere. The wait was longer than quoted so that kind of sucked. Otherwise, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Got BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger. It was ok, it wasn't bad, tasted good but it was surprisingly small. Definitely not worth $12.95 for the burger alone. A side of fries/tater tots/sweet potato tots was an additional $4.95. However,  service was awesome! To me, it's an overpriced burger joint that sells alcohol and has a host that seats you. It's like going to Five Guys but waiting to be seated, with a bar. The decor is very casual, which is why i was perplexed at the necessity of a host. But, given that there were a lot of people i do understand the need to control traffic. I sat at the bar and didn't have to wait. But if i needed a table it was a 15 minute wait. The curiosity of going to a celebrity's restaurant lured most people in. The desire for me to eat something quick and new was what lured me in. It was when i got there that i learned of the Wahlberg Family. I do recommend trying it but be warned that portion sizes don't match their prices. For a $13 burger i expect grass-fed meat and cheese; nitrite & nitrate free, uncured bacon, on a sprouted grain bun LOL! You get my drift, right)?"}
{"text":"Well, the burgers smelled good....
We ordered a House Burger to share as a snack, and waited and waited and waited....never got our food and bar staff never checked on our food (or us). We had to ask the server why everyone around us was receiving their food before us- we suspect the server never placed our order. Bummer. Back to Bobby Flay Burger House!"}
{"text":"Food was good. It sucks that fries doesn't come with the burger. Customer service sucked! It took them forever to just get us our drinks,forever to come get out orders, forever to get food, forever to give us our tab."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the O.F.D. burger with \"government cheese\" instead of swiss. It was really good! I ordered onion rings as a side...got a huge basket of the thin crispy onion rings. Tried dipping them in the mustard sauce and the Wahl sauce. I liked the mustard sauce better. Service was good too. We had a party of six and everyone left satisfied. We wanted to take pictures and have someone take a picture of our group, and staff members were happy to oblige."}
{"text":"My Cali GF visited LV from the OC, where I'm from too, & after Bruno Mars show last night, she craved for this place, but it was a 45-min wait, so here we are today, fulfilling that crave before she heads back to SoCal. Love the place, the good food, happy ambience, & great service. We ate so well. Love Paul's sauce"}
{"text":"Been a big fan of the show and finally got a chance to try their food as I was in Las Vegas for my birthday this past weekend. 

I got the Our Burger (Paul's favorite) and a pina colada. The wife got the BBQ bacon (Donnie's favorite). We shared a side of tots. The total was $43 post tax. A bit expensive but well worth it. The burgers were fantastic and everything I hoped it would be. The tots were tasty and the drink was really good. 

What sets this place apart was the service was exemplary and they really do make you feel like family and it's not just for show on their show. 

I look forward to trying another wahlburgers should I be in a town that has one. Or they could just open one in Los Angeles already."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this and I was so disappointed! We waited for an hour to be seated. It was crowded, dirty, and they were trying to force a seated table system to a counter operation. So, it was a cluster, as you would expect. I was told I could not bring in my Starbucks I had bought while waiting outside in the 100+ degree heat (no inside waiting area) by the hostess, yet I saw several other groups bring in drinks. So, apparently OK for some, not for others. The service was OK. The menu items are ala carte and the fries/rings/tots are expensive and the portions are small. All three were served to us COLD! Yuk! The burger was OK. It was expensive! I can think of about seven other burger places I like better and every one of them is less than half the price and much more conveniently located. So, in summary, probably will stay in business due to tourists on the strip. For locals, it's a hard pass! 

I hope the Wahlburgs read these reviews and rethink their Vegas strategy. They chose a poor location, the food is marginal, the service is not great, and the prices are too high! Epic fail!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, customer service however was not. Our waitress of the name Jenny was not charismatic and got both our burgers wrong. Didn't seem interested in us at all. For such a family oriented establishment this seemed surprising to me. You can get better service at Chipotle tbh. Prior to dining in, we had to call because we missed the sign and wanted to make sure we were in the right place, and the person on the phone had an attitude when I asked saying that it's obviously the restaurant with Wahlburgers on the front, great food, sucky service."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar; bartender was fantastic, burgers were very tasty, the onion rings were off the hook...dry & thin! Fries were good but the Tots must be tried next time.
We recommend trying!
The Wahlbergs done good!!!"}
{"text":"Burger was aggressively seasoned, onion rings were phenomenal. Fries were shit but the fluffanuttah was excellent."}
{"text":"My husband really wanted to try this place because of the show (duh) I was iffy because of the already underwhelming reviews bit what the hell. Can't keep a man from his burger. 

So we checked in and there was already a line about 5 people in front of us. Was offered a bar seat because there were some seats open, but we decided to wait instead. The only good thing about their wait system is you can leave your number and they text you when you have your table ready. So meanwhile, we went around the little shops around (there's a lush nearby btw for all my ladies lol) 

Service was okay. Everything was served pretty fast.

Food was average. You really can't come in here comparing it to in n out or shake shack. You'll be setting yourself up for disappointment. Price point is a bit high comparing to the said places above. Tater tots were anemic and not seasoned. 

Will we be back? Probably not, it's a nice novelty place to try once especially if you're a fan. But there's so many more places that are better around Vegas."}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place........ grrat service and a damn good burger. this is lv so of course it is touristy, but honestly it is an absolute amazing burger."}
{"text":"The food is great, with engaging and friendly staff. Service is quick and the establishment was clean. Would be a five star but to pay for parking and the high cost of the food just not a local place perfect for a tourist that wants to try the food ."}
{"text":"We were there at the new Block at Northway location in the North Hills on McKnight Rd. Nice place. Love the tater tots. Burgers are good."}
{"text":"Stopped in while waiting for a flight - best beer selection in the f Wing of the airport - we split the chicken sandwich and added sweet potato tots - everything was delicious ! Great service - we would come back and recommend as a great layover stop"}
{"text":"Fine burger joint at Toronto airport

Visited Wahlburgers in Terminal 1 in the Gate F (US departures) area. This ia a hamburger joint with really good burgers served various ways (I chose the patty melt). Also offered salads, various chicken sandwiches, salads and some inventive sides. The fries were okay but only okay.

Beer and liquor and good service. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for mediocre burgers. The tots were way too salty and the onion rings were weak. Server was very good, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Whoever made my chicken sandwhich deserves to be on the Grammys. I felt like I had a an orgasm in my mouth and it came out golden. Dead azz it was so good. Made me realize how important global warming was. I would have changed my presidency vote if I had this chicken sandwhich before the election."}
{"text":"This place was not crowded at all on the night of an Indians game, which surprised us. Seating was quick but service was EXCEPTIONALLY slow. We wanted margaritas, but they said the couldn't make it because if they tried their blender would break.... what??? They ran out of Miller light, and out of 3 IPA's on the menu, they ran out of one. Waited an hour to receive our food. Burgers were cold. Cobb salad came with Italian instead of blue cheese, which is what it comes with. Manager paid for our food, but he said himself, \"I wouldn't even call this kitchen 'my' kitchen\". Never coming back."}
{"text":"The check in staff was great - they told us it was a 20-30 minute wait, but we waited maybe 5 minutes before we got the text our table was ready.   It was around lunch time when we went, so I expected it to be busy - however service wasn't the greatest.  I waited a long time to get a refill on a soda and almost had to ask another server.  Food, however was fine and came out super quick.  Burger was good, tots were great, and the Mac and Cheese with smoke Bacon was amazing (though I did get it without bacon).  There were a bit too much bread crumbs on it, but once you get past those it was soooo good.   

If you don't want to sit down, they have a little area you can order to go right out by the road near the Subway."}
{"text":"Went here because of the TV show. Now that I've been there I don't think I'd go back.  Burgers are decent but overpriced."}
{"text":"The sloppy joe did not disappoint! Plus I got the tater tots loaded with 4 cheese sauce & chili & it was only $5.50! Great price & size! Simple food with a kiss of gourmet flare. The waitstaff was incredibly friendly our waitress had a great personality so that made it fun. I purchased a souvenir shirt says 'Mom's Favorite' cracks me up since there are 4 kids in my family and we are all tied for last."}
{"text":"Only flaw is that there is always at least a 15 minute wait up to 45 min. 

Great service, staff is fun and friendly.

New impossible burger is amazing. The onion rings with Wahlburger sauce is on point for calorie ridden guilty pleasure food. Cocktails tried were good and I had some marshmallow peanut butter nuttawhatta something adult milkshake that was superb. 

We all drank and had a good time and enjoyed ourselves. I am only new kid fan in group but we all had fun posing with mark cardboard figure. As a new kid fan please add a Donnie cardboard too. 

Vegetarian and limited vegan option. 

All 3 of us left to walk the strip a bit happier, fuller, and drunker. Will be back I have been 3 times already."}
{"text":"I'm all about this Wahlburgers! Amazing food, simple menu and really good prices for a strip restaurant. Don't get this confused with the vendor shop on the sidewalk part of the strip, this one is right under the Bally's escalator. Customer service is hit and miss but the food is truly great. Moist burgers, fresh produce, crisp fries (or tots). If you like burgers, you gotta check this place out. I would like to see customer service consistently good but other than that, no complaints. Overall, Wahlburgers is a great spot to grab some grub for a cheaper price on the strip. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers but felt small for the price (even considering the Vegas surcharge). Tator tots were great but nothing out of the norm.  BBQ bacon burger was good."}
{"text":"Very hesitant upon coming in because of passed reviews we have read, but decided to give it a chance anyways. We came in on this passed Friday night. As soon as we walked in it seemed to be not the busiest night but still full enough. We saw 2 hostesses seating and clearing tables which we later got their names on the way out because of their exceptional customer service in dealing with my family. The hostess that was what looked like stationed at the door failed to pay us any mind and seemed to be holding more of a personal conversation with her what seemed to be her boyfriend. We wandered for a minute wondering where to go until both of the other hostesses immediately ran over to see if we were helped. And promptly cleared and sat us at a booth in the back and apologized on the confusion and even gave us recommendations on what we're their favorites. 

Our great server Bianca came over within 5 minutes to take our drink order and asked if we were ready to order or needed some time. She quickly returned back with our drinks. The food came within reasonable time. The BBQ bacon burger was what I expected and I was not disappointed. My wife got the same and my son got the children's chicken fingers which came in a much larger portion then I thought and was very pleased with that. The remainder of our night was enjoyable, our server and the two vibrant hostesses we spoke with early came to check on us and see if we had everything we needed and how the food was. 

Overall I would recommend people to come dine in and experience wahlburgers. I will be coming back with my family. I just wanted to write a review to change the bad rep that's been put on wahlburgers."}
{"text":"Good Try Wahlburgers but your going have to do better in this foody City.We are spoiled with lots of good burger joints.From the Start:30 minute wait to be seated,another 50 mins to get our Food.A burger that is thinner than the thickness of your finger is not a burger.The \"Onion Rings\"aren't Onion Rings more like Fresh French's onion toppings.My chicken sandwich had the Onion Rings on it as a topping but you can get them as the side as well? WHAT DA HECK is that lol.This is nothing more than a gimmick and celebrity driven idea.Dave and Busters will be the competition when that opens and Wahlburgers won't be any more than a 1 and done thing.I wouldn't recommend to any burger Enthusiast and I see PITTSBURGHERS only eating here once.Average at Best and Manipulative Marketing.I don't like fast food but I'd say a step above fast food."}
{"text":"So for just having opened - it was actually very smooth!   They took our name and number and said it would be 60 to 90 minutes.  Immediately got a link that took you to Yelp and showed your place in line and we were 22nd.  In actuality it took about 40 minutes until our table was ready.  The waitress was very nice, forgot a couple of little things - but again, they JUST opened.  It probably took about 30 minutes for the food to show up, we all got burgers, and they were all good. 2 of us got their \"house\" burger and 1 got their Swiss mushroom burger with bacon - called the OFD - all were good.  We each ordered different sides, thin onion rings and tater tots that were good, Mac & cheese that was excellent and macaroni salad called Alma's that was was so-so.   I had a beer and 2 soft drinks - the bill was $56.  I'd definitely go back, but probably not a super regular stop.  They were far more together than I expected for a restaurant that just opened!  All staff was very friendly - again to be commended for a new place!!!"}
{"text":"I have been sitting here for 30 mins and no update on my food. This place is incredibly slow and will never come back. It's unfortunate because I really liked four brothers and the departed."}
{"text":"I find wahlburgers overrated. The patty isn't as juicy as it can be for the price that is being paid. As well, they can definitely find better bun for the burger. I'm not saying Wahlburgers is bad... just that it's okay... I definitely had better burgers for the same price. 

However, there isn't that many choices for food in the transborder airside either...

** warning : there's usually a wait of 10 minutes for the burger... so if it is busy, the wait can be longer!! **"}
{"text":"I am a local Las Vegas resident. Had family visit from out of town, who had high hopes of visiting Walburgers since their big fans of the TV series Walbergs. To put it lightly, I was not impressed with the Las Vegas location. Service was really bad. Every employee looked unhappy- no smiles, no follow-ups, we even had to flag down three different waitresses just to get some ketchup. Above all the burger \"Thanksgiving\" was just mediocre and the fries tasted old. My burger had less than a  tablespoon of yams and cranberries and the stuffing was falling apart and out of the burger. I could see how it could be potentially a great burger if it were made right. With so much other choices of restaurants to choose from on the strip, I would suggest the Walberg establishment step it up by changing the management at their Las Vegas location as I believe this is probably the root of the problem."}
{"text":"So freaking good!!!! It is a burger. No artsy fartsy fois gras. No truffle mayo. It's just a good burger. The wally sauce is amazing and they make their own pickles which are some of the best I've ever had and I hail from strong bohemian roots. The service was great and what I love is they took my number so I went and gambled and then they texted me when my table was ready!!!! That is amazing plus beers are served in cans or by draft which adds to awesomeness. Yes prices are a little higher than needed but it's Vegas, centrally located and great service. I will gladly pay more for a well cooked hamburger. The tater tots are great too!!!! Definitely check it out. Plus there's an Irish fella that makes you feel right at home. Can't wait for local deals to come!!!!! Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"We were on the waiting list with no one in front of us.  When we arrived they said we would be seated next.  They seated two parties ahead of us.  After the third party was seated before us once again we decided to leave.  We were so looking forward to trying this new restaurant but,  we left extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Place was crowded but we didn't wait too long to be seated. While visiting Vegas, this was one spot we wanted to try. It was a bit pricey but glad we gave it a try. Wasn't a big fan of the chic walking around trying to force to take a picture. She said it was absolutely free so we agreed. Then she came out with some bs photo, pic was small and said that was free. Then she showed us the better pics to purchase. Was a bit turned off by that. We did enjoy our lunch and the serving staff was great."}
{"text":"Don't judge me for getting a burger and tots at 6:45am.  I was so excited to see a Wahlburgers location at the Toronto Airport on the F concourse of Terminal 1 at Gate F67 that I could not help myself.

The decor of the restaurant is very modern and ... well ... very green.  The word art on the ceiling and the communal tables that dominated the center of the restaurant must make for an active scene when the concourse is busy.  Early in the morning, however, things were pretty quiet.

I was glad it was slow because it gave my server, Gail, a chance to be absolutely amazing.  She guided me through the menu - eventually convincing me that the OFD was the way to go.  I am glad she did.

The OFD is a mushroom swiss burger, but it was so much more than that.  A flaky, buttery bun with a juicy, but a little salty beef patty.  There were plenty of mushrooms, but if I had one complaint it was that the cheese slice was a little small.

Gail suggested the tater tots and rewarded my decision to order them with a small cup of Wahl sauce to dip them in.  Wahl sauce is a ketchup mayo combo that is charged with smoky and slightly spicy goodness.

Check out Wahlburgers when you are at Pearson - it is worth it."}
{"text":"Burgers are mediocre, which would be fine if they didn't cost $10 without fries or tots. This is not a $13-$15 meal, especially when there are direct competitors in BRGR, Burgatory, and Burghers nearby that all serve excellent burgers for the same price or less."}
{"text":"Food was good $3.50 for water is outrageous pricing is  high
The hamburger was good I go back fries or nothing special ordinary and it's a little pricey"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with coworkers. Out of our 3 orders, 2 of them were done wrong. We arrived before the lunchtime rush but we still waited 15-20 minutes for our burgers. Once the burgers were made, it took an extra 5 minutes for the servers/cook staff to determine which burger was which. We had to watch them poke around our burgers with a pen to try and determine what toppings were on it. Afterwards, one of the burgers had an egg on it, which we hadn't asked for but because of the long wait time, we just took our order as is. Once we started eating, another burger had the wrong toppings on it.

Quite a shame as I was really hoping this place would be good. I think with better organization and staff training, they could stand a chance but with the way things are now, I feel like it would be rare for people to make a second visit."}
{"text":"So excited it's finally open! I had the BBQ burger aka Donnie Burger it was very yummy. Food service was very fast. Staff was friendly and our server John was very accomodating with our requests. I would have given 5 stars but they ran the wrong charge on my card so next time we will let them know before we need to split the check. Other than that everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Found hair in my bun.  I'm not one to make a scene.  So I simply just ate my fries, told the server I was full and went somewhere else. I'm sure it was an innocent mistake.  But this is enough to not return."}
{"text":"I must be honest, I was not expecting much from Wahlburgers... I was expecting an average burger only popular because it's owned by a famous family and boy was I wrong. 

My boyfriend and I stopped in during our staycation walking the strip and, as we were craving burgers, decided to give this place a shot. Despite the full looking restaurant, we were seated quickly and received our drinks in paper cups (surprising for a sit-down restaurant, but charming). I ordered \"The Our Burger\" (when in Rome, am I right) and my boyfriend ordered the O.F.D. with a side of tater tots to share. let me make note, i do not like American aka \"government\" cheese so I wasn't really sure how i would like my burger but we were both blown away. He went dead silent from the moment he took a bite and when he finally came up for air all he could say was, \"wow\". Mine was also amazing - juicy, flavorful, perfectly cooked. and the tots were the perfect amount of crispy! 

Driving the the strip is such a pain but i'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We came to Wahlburgers because of the family. But the Cleveland location has a lot of work to do! For a new location Mark or Paul or someone  needs to revist this location. The staff all need a presentation on representation of a company. Our waiter was very apologetic and sincere. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm dissapointed. Stopped by yesterday afternoon, the wait was 45 min for 2 people and no to-go food. Only seats readily available this morning were at the bar. The bartender wasn't exactly nice either and didn't know the menu well.

My portabello burger was sloppy and I even requested the extra sauteed mushrooms on the side. The carmelized onions were way too sweet.
The sweet potato tots also werent cooked enough and so were soft and soggy as well.

2 stars because hubbs ordered the OFB hambuger and fries. No compliants there as it was a regular hambuger."}
{"text":"After spending some time upstairs at the bar we came down to eat. Got sat down by a bitch hostess (huge attitude) but thankfully our server was good!! Food was good but nothing special, wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if I'm in the area and wanted a burger I would go here."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The waiter was funny, very nice, and on top of it! The food didn't take long at all even though they were very busy! I was so happy to have been able to take out cups home as they are reusable. Souvenirs!! Overall everything was great! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best burgers we have ever had by far! French fries were amazing as well! Everything cooked to order! Very friendly staff. Go here if you can!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time and really enjoyed our bartender, Liz, she was great! Would  recommend going and sit by Liz, she will take great care of you!!"}
{"text":"The  house burgers were really good. My husband ordered a shake coz we want to know if it was also good and it was. The service was fast. I gave 3 stars because it is pricey and the bathroom is around the corner.
Update: when we got home from Las Vegas, my husband did not finish the chocolate malt shake. He found out the chip on the cup when he removed the plastic cap (the green cup can be reused). We don't know what could have happen.
I just wish they changed the chipped cup before they served it to the customer."}
{"text":"My order was wrong and they took it back and promised me a new one. About fifteen seconds later it came and it was actually the same sandwich sans the things I wanted off in the first place. I could tell because they didn't remove everything and my sandwich was cold. I guess that's what happens when your server doesn't write down the order! My bartender was amazing so that kind of saved the meal!"}
{"text":"Not as good as Fenway Park, onion rings were cold had to send them back, french fries were cold had to send them back no silverware whatsoever just wasn't as good not even close. But the service was excellent.. regular hamburger with a small headache"}
{"text":"Was so excited to have a burger joint come into our area, instead of another pizza place. Went here and was so disappointing. Sat in the dining area and the burgers were ok, and the fries were served in the paper cups like in the take out stuff. Onion rings weren't even onion rings but like the stuff they put on your steak for garnish. Was shocked to see the 18% mandatory tip, where our server didn't do much but take our order, give us the food, and brought us waters (we don't drink alcohol). Only to find out we could of ordered the same food for the same price and sit up stairs in the fast food area for free and saved the 18% or even walked the block home. Never going back."}
{"text":"I had The Jenny, basically a chicken sandwich with crispy onion strings. It was pretty damn good actually. But the tater tots were lacking. They needed salt and they were kind of cold.
My girl had the mac n cheese and it was too runny, that definitely needed improvement."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant, but I was very disappointed when I arrived. 

They have a sit down section and a to-go section.

We arrived around lunch time and wanted our food to-go. The line took FOREVER to move with one girl behind the register. The food was pricy, but I mean, it's Vegas, that is expected. I ordered The Melt, salad version, no bread for me! It was SOO good. Kudos on the food Wahlbergs! 

The cashier, girls prepping food and manager were all so sweet, but we waited almost 20 minutes to get our food. It honestly was not THAAAT crowded, they kept mixing up the to-go orders with the sitdown orders. It seemed like the servers in the sit down area were annoyed with the crowd waiting in the to-go section,there was no where to wait really so we were in their way.

As far a cleanliness, they could sure step it up. There was trash on the floor and the condiments section was a mess. The servers would leave their cups and water bottles around where guests can see - I know it was the servers because I saw them put them down and take them once they headed to the back. If it was trash, they should have just tossed it."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Sadly, I tend to rush when traveling so yes, I rolled my eyes when I was told I had to wait 10 minutes for my Jenn's Chicken Burger. Let me tell you, it was so succulent and amazing! I actually took a few bites and put it back in my bag because I wanted to savour the taste. I was afraid to finish it! Not sure what the burgers or other items are like BUT this chicken sandwich was a god send for my 5+ hour flight. Will def stop by again on my next trip to the city."}
{"text":"Great food. We tried everything and it was all good. Service was great. Our waiter Rob was awesome. Super cool guy and was very good at his job."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great cafeteria food, then this is your place. Service is absentminded, food is overpriced and the only thing worse is Mark Whalburg's transformers movie...but seriously though, absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Quick dinner before concert, this restaurant located in the outdoor mall at Bally's. With the heat around us, we didn't really want to walk around to far to find a place to have a fast dinner. 

Thank goodness this place wasn't too packed, well at least in the bar area. We sat directly because we didn't want to wait for most around 20-25 minutes just for burgers & fries. 

We waited until a bartender asked if we already being help. I ordered the chicken fingers with fries, with a coke and my husband ordered the salad bowl with burgers on top. 

The chicken fingers was just ordinary taste, fried perfect, but the fries was way too overcooked and the inside was empty so pretty kinda hard bite. 
The salad bowl was okay, nothing special about it. 

Inside of the restaurant was pretty hot, it'd be nice if they turn the AC higher or put a fan near the bar area. 

Service was friendly. But would I be back next time? Maybe or maybe not. It's definitely not worth the price, I'd rather just spend the $ to watch his movie instead lol"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. The wait staff are very friendly and attentive, the drinks are on point. The burgers are great, not too greasy and not dry. I did notice a bit of inconsistency though. The first time we came here we got the mac and cheese and it was actually the best I've ever had (I am old and have had a lot of mac and cheese in my time) but this time it was dry with almost no cheese, all of the cheese sauce (which tasted canned to me) was on the bottom. The first time it had a sauce that tasted homemade and then had melted cheese on top. This was the part of the meal I was looking forward to the most. The bartender did an excellent job of pouring me a perfect Guinness so I was happy with that. Overall, I really do lile the food and the atmosphere, I just hope they get the consistency of the recipes together before I return."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever had at restaurant!!! The service was so bad I cancelled my order and asked for my money back. Did I mention I've been waiting for this restaurant to open since I first heard about on the Wahlburgers Tv show and impatiently waiting/stocking them on all social media since then.  So I'm very sad to say I didn't even get to try the food. So now I guess now I'll be waiting for the one to open in LA....."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I went on a Friday afternoon and was able to get a table pretty quickly.  Requesting first available, we were seated outside (with decent fans in the heat) within about 10 minutes of checking in with the host.

I had the Our Burger, and it was particularly good with the melty cheese and signature sauce.  It cost a little more for $13, but that's not a bad price for a decent burger on the strip in Vegas.  The french fries were definitely big enough to split between 2 or 3 people, and they were just the right amount of crisp on the outside and soft/hot on the inside.  I would definitely get either of these again on the next visit."}
{"text":"Dont waste your money on these crap burgers... zero flavor... nasty... totally disappointed... their menu specifies \"government\" cheese... come on guys... this is Vegas... In N Out kicks their you know what... come to think about it even Jack in the Box in McDonald's crushes them... absolutely horrible... they are probably called Wahlburgers because
once take a bite you want to throw it against the wall!!!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try a Wahlburgers since seeing it on the show. We went for a late night snack last night and enjoyed a delicious burger. We also ordered the onion rings that came out a little on the cool side. We asked our waiter to take them back and take off the grill. A couple minutes later the manager brought out fresh ones with two sauces to try and still removed from our bill. Fantastic service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This Wahlburgers is not up to Paul's standards. Had a terrible time at this location. Not sure how the Wahlburgers franchise system is run but I think that Paul would be ashamed if he knew what was going on at this location. 

First, I'm at the airport on business and hungry. I saw the familiar Wahlburgers sign. I go over to the restaurant. There is a sign that says \"Please wait to be seated\". So I wait. The hostess comes over and doesn't seat me, she chats with other people, then some more people get in line. She looks around me and takes two different  groups of people and seats them. Apparently I am invisible. After that I walked away in disgust. 

Eventually I came back because I hadn't eaten all day. I was finally seated. I ordered a soda and \"The Melt\" burger. 

While waiting I couldn't help but notice that there were fruit flies in the glass, dishwasher, and both beer tap areas of the bar. 

After some time, the food arrived. The burger was gray and very dry. This disgusting thing between two pieces of bread was far past well done. I politely refused to eat it and given the sanitation issues of this location declined to have the burger remade. The burger was taken off the bill. I took a picture of this nasty thing and the receipts as proof of the legitimacy of this review. 

The one bright thing about this restaurant was that the bartender Wendy was great. She worked very hard the whole time. 

Paul, please visit this disaster and restore your reputation. This is not like your Hingham location. After reading other people's reviews, I seem not to be alone in my strong dislike of this location."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were not what one expected. Small place that didn't look as accommodating as the one on the show. I had the patty melt which wasn't on rye bread as one usually is. Nothing comes with it and it was expensive. I would say it was a 3/5. My husband had the Mom's Sloppy Joe which also was ok. Very pricey (11.95) for an open faced sandwich with nothing else but a small paper cup of pickles. 

The servers were very friendly and the service was good. However, the music was sooooo loud one couldn't hear yourself think let alone talk to others unless you were shouting. 
of. 
All in all, we will not return. If you are curious to go for the experience and to compare it to the show don't bother."}
{"text":"Excellent onion rings, Thanksgiving burger was amazing if your looking for a bit healthier selection. Hubby got Moms Favorite & was a bit disappointed as he thought it would be more than just sloppy joe on piece of bread with onion curls. We got seated right away, service was great, multiple ppl checking on us. Got our complimentary postcard pic for New years gift!  Excited to go back & try something else as there are no locations in South Dakota yet!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a quick bite before u catch your flight. Burgers are small; not too filling"}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving two stars is because the food is good. The service is another thing.  The young lady at the front that took my initial request for a table was so nice.  She was very sweet and personable that's the only reason why we waited.  The service was horrible we were rushed through the ordering process.  The food came before our drinks. Not once did the gentleman  (I'm trying to be kind to your server because he certainly was the opposite of a gentleman) come back to ask how we were doing.  I actually went to the back of your house to get my own ranch dressing.   And your drinks are way overpriced!!! And what's up with not having a restroom in your restaurant?!?  So Wahlbergers... your name brought me in  but your service won't bring us back."}
{"text":"I'm going to tell you guys right now, this is a second visit review happening right here.  The first time I went, probably a 3.  But this time...this time it's a 4 star.

Let me tell you how this went down.

I had been to Wahlburgers by myself and ordered the OUR BURGER.  That is a mistake folks.  The our burger is generic and not what you want to be tasting on in this place.

You have to try THE MELT. It's basically a Grilled Cheese Bacon Burger.  

I can't move right now and I'm pretty sure my intestines are going to shut down in a few minutes...but I'm good. 

Heaven, I'm ready for ya."}
{"text":"Well let me start off with the burger...I had the double patty with swiss....the meat was bland and not tasty at all, the sauce wasn't that great either, and the only way I could eat it, was to put some of their chili on it...with that being said, I also ordered the chili...now that I must say was really good (probably the best I've ever had) the right mix of spices and the chucks of meat made it even more better...so I guess I'd have to say the chili was a bowl awesomeness...maybe I just had a bad burger or the chef was off his game that day...so I'm gonna have to give it another shot..."}
{"text":"SO SO SOOOO GOOD!!! The burgers were so delicious and the thin onion strings were soooo tasty! Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Being a local in Las Vegas I was excited to try this place out mainly because I love the show and how family oriented they are on tv.  I'm not a picky eater and really wanted to like the food but it just wasn't good.  Went on a weekday so it wasn't too packed and got seated right away. Our server came over and he just didn't seem too happy to be there.  We ordered a couple of their specialty burgers and half fries/half tots.  The food took a bit long to get to our table but we were okay with that because we figured it would be cooked to perfection.... wrong.  When we finally got our food, it was COLD.  The kitchen had a window so you could kind of see the cooks cooking and putting the food in the window so I have no idea how it went from the window to our table cold?!  I'm confused.  Giving a 2 star cause the location was nice and I like the tv show.  Good luck guys."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night before a concert. They were busy, but we only waited a half hour. Hostesses and all wait staff were very nice. My chocolate frappe (it's Boston lingo for a milkshake) was very, very good and nice and thick. My husband and I both had the OFD and tater tots. The burgers were good and the tater tots were perfect-crispy not a bit soggy. The lack of a fifth star is because you really can only get your burger one way-medium. My medium rare was not, but it wasn't a deal breaker by any means. Is it the best burger in Cleveland? Sorry, no. Flipside, Heck's and B Spot are all better. I do recommend the different sauces that Paul has created. They are interesting and enhance the food."}
{"text":"The burger was OK. But the service was really laid back... At some places you have servers standing at attention really ready to serve. Didn't get that feeling here. Felt like people didn't want to be there and have something better to do."}
{"text":"Wanted to give a three star but after we were seated outside in the sidewalk waiting to be seated our hosted walked out in her break looking us over after she said we would be seated in a couple of minutes. It took having to talk to a surprised hostess who was on shift, to seat us. 
The salad came late. Not to any fault other than lack of communication. Our server Miguel made up for the disheartening first impression. But the girl with the chopsticks in hair needs a lesson on costumer service. Even when on break you should tell the people you left waiting outside something. Not a fan of a place with poor communication."}
{"text":"Thought the food was mediocre at best.. I went there when they were first opening and the service was absolutely terrible. I watched them serve my food to the table next to us, saw those customers touch it, notify their server it wasnt there food.. the server took the food back to the kitchen and tried to deliver it to me about 30 seconds later as if I didn't notice.."}
{"text":"We came in on a weekday at lunch and had a 30 min wait.  We had a drink at a nearby bar while we waited.  If you take that route make sure you finish your drink because they will make you chug it or dump it.  We had an Our Burger, Double Decker, Onion Rings (more like straws), Fries, Fluffanuttahh Adult Frappe, Wicked Wahlbanger and Spiked Lemonade.  Our food was A-OK.  It's not BurGR or Shake Shack but it wasn't horrible either.  Burgers were actually pretty good but they were more like fast food burgers.  Problem for me is they are priced as upscale burgers.  From the dining area to the food and service Wahlburgers is not upscale.  There are much better burger spots at this price point.  They need to make it counter service and shave a few bucks off the prices."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and menu selection at Wahlburgers. The service was really good, and the food was satisfying. 

Also one of the best Root Beer Floats I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The place is good! I got a cheeseburger that was cooked perfectly and onion rings. I wouldn't call them onion rings though. The menu says the onions are thinly sliced, so I was like yeah, ok. I wasn't expecting fried, mandoline shaved pieces of onion. Friend ordered chili cheese fries and some type of jalapeno burger. I didn't care for the fries. It's pricey as is, but $4.95 for a Diet Coke?! I personally could care less that I got to \"keep the cup.\" Server was attentive and nice, but you can tell it's a \"keep it moving\" type of place. I'm glad I went for the experience, but doubt I'll go again."}
{"text":"Me, my parents, and a childhood friend of mine went here for my 22nd birthday this week. The food was good, but I had to knock two stars off this review because our order of fries came back cold. Our waiter was friendly enough to give us a free, extra order of fries as an apology. When I looked back at the kitchen from our booth, I noticed that several other fries were sitting on the counter for several seconds, even minutes on end. I recommend this place, but if you order fries, they may come back cold."}
{"text":"So we were visiting Vegas and decided to try out Wahlburgers, after all the hoopla I have seen on the food networks, why not!! I ordered the \" Our burger\" and fries.  My wife thought I ordered it from the kids menu!! Its a small burger! C'mon now!!  And the patty was a bit skinny too. The fries were tasty, overall nothing to wait in line for! 
A few days later we went to Chili's! Now were talkin'! I ordered the \"Sunrise Burger\" , fried egg and fries are included for about the same price!! Chilis gives you points to use on your order, received a free soft drink and dessert!!  Just like Lil John says \" What!!! , What!! \"  I think Chilis has the \"Right Stuff!\""}
{"text":"I wanted to love it.  I am from Massachusetts originally and we love them!  In fact, my in laws went there the day before and loved it.  We had some time before our flight back to California and decided to grab some food.  The line was mismanaged.  The girl seating everyone just stood there and seemed like she had no idea what was going on.  We were very excited once we got seated.  The menu looked amazing and the adult milkshakes were delicious.  An hour passed and no food.  Finally we had to ask for them to pack our food to go.  We had to run out to try and catch our plane.  We took the food to eat while we were waiting.  The onion rings were good even cold.  My husband's burger was good.  I ordered a burger melt and when I eagerly unwrapped it, I was so disappointed to find a grilled cheese.  No burger.  I paid for a burger and got a grilled cheese.  Ugh.  Complete disappointment.  I expected a lot more from them."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite to eat before shopping. 
This location had just opened so it was packed. 
Two hour wait to be seated but the bar was open seating. 
We grabbed two spots & waited patiently because they were so slammed. 
We both ordered the Our Burgers. 
I topped mine with bacon & avocado spread in addition to the regular toppings. I also ordered a side of Yukon gold fries. The garlic mayo mustard dip was delicious. It's one if the many sauces/dressings available. 
The food was good. It was along the lines of Five Guys or Red Robin. 
Service was pretty good considering the amount of people that the staff was waiting on. 
Loved the decor."}
{"text":"I had to try this place and none of us were disappointed(4 pple) and we ordered different things... my sis got the rootbeer float and loved it.. she wanted to go back there more than once just for that.  I had Donnie's favorite the barbecue bacon which comes with jalapenos boy it tasted so good meat was cooked medium well as I asked. All of our fries were crispy and are made pretty quickly idk if they just sit back there or  fried upon order but either way it still tasted fresh. in the end we wind up rushing out but wanted extra fries the guy said ill be back in a minute and he literally was.. everyone's burger was very good and made the way they wanted it..  just check where u sit because some tables and chairs were dirty i guess they need better turn around time cleaning but the food and drinks were on point i would definitely try them again wherever i find a location. Oh u dont have to get government cheese jus sub it like we did. (9/20)"}
{"text":"Get food on the strip, affordable with great portion sizes, loved the chopped salad option! Rob did a great  job, showing up at the perfect time through out our meal."}
{"text":"I really love the burgers here, although they are slightly overpriced IMO. My husband got the impossible burger and said it was delicious but shocked when we got the bill as it was $19. It wasn't listed on the menu so we should have asked. Otherwise, the service is good and great burgers."}
{"text":"You have no idea how happy I was when it hit me there was one out here! Been to all on the east coast and loved them! 

This one is super good! Felt like I was in hingham mass, eating! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"The burger was surprisingly delicious. I didn't know what to expect but the burger was a classic. I'm from a small town. So if you want that small town taste of home feel good burger I would check out Wahlburger. Also for all my gluten free people out there. They have delicious gluten free buns. The server said they are made daily from a local bakery! So fresh, fresh, fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"Talk about a got da*m lit joint! Patty melt and sweet potato tots were off the hook but Liz. Sweet baby Jesus  you won't find a better bartender this side of the pond! 
If your fortunate enough to have this beauty serving you, bet that sweet ass you're leaving with a smile across your ugly mug. Tip well or I'll find you and beat that broke dlck into the dirt, Mark Whalburg style."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! One of the best burger ive had in a while. Great service and easy on the wallet! Well worth the stop of your in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome patio. Great food. I can see why some of the low stars on service but I didn't think it was that bad. Wahl sauce is awesome. Overall I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went around lunch time and the wait to sit at a table was going to be around 30 mins which wasn't too bad there was a few open tables in the shade to wait out front. Spotted a couple leaving the bar after waiting a few minutes and was able to go sit down there as its first come first serve at the bar. 

Ordered the Melt burger with avocado spread and the mustard sauce on the side and an order of the crispy onion straws. Split the burger and onion straws with my fiancé and was defiantly enough food for the both of us since we weren't too hungry. The servers at the bar were really attentive and super nice. They also take your picture and you get a free post card and optional other pictures in frames or just the pictures alone for sale. Ended up paying $10 for just the pictures without the frame. 

 Overall great experience and delicious food. Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"So far so good. Great clean place with some great burger selections. I had the turkey burger and bud had the melt. Both awesome. And so glad we got tater tots. So good!"}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant. Of course one has to go just because of the name and story. Yes the service was good and the food was good. . . BUT! Sooooooo not worth $20 for a burger, fries and drink. 
Far too many other better options in Toronto for much less."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever eaten!! Service was excellent too!!"}
{"text":"I think coming here was a great idea and best experience ever. My server was PJ, he was just awesome all around. He recommended the Thanksgiving Day Sandwich with Sweet Potato Tots, perfect combo, great taste. I would definetly come back! Thanks for the great experience and good recommendations PJ!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ burger, a double decker, whatever they claimed was their version of onion rings that just looked like scraps, sweet potato tots, and a strawberry shake for $40. 

I found the food here to be WAY overpriced and the buns were unusually greasy. 

I actually found this place to be an almost equivalent of chipotle in NY, meaning the super longggggg lines just to place an order for food. Smh...

Even though I'm visiting Toronto, I don't see myself trying to eat here again before I leave for NY. 

Unlike when I found Sonic and made my way over there about 3 or 4 times."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the show and was super excited to see they finally opened one in Las Vegas. Came around 8ish pm and there was a 45 minute to an hour wait. It was just my son and I and the hostess was very nice and tried her best to get us seated right away, she could see my son was hungry. Sat down after waiting for about a half hour. I ordered the melt and added mushrooms and a fried egg with sweet potato tots. My son got the \"Smahlburger\" and a chocolate mint frappe/shake. Everything was delicious. Our server, Alexis, she was awesome. Hostess even came back around and checked on us to make sure we were ok. That's great service. I'll definitely be back to try their other selections."}
{"text":"Mark Wahlburg's restaurant. Been wanting to visit for a while to see if the food is any good. We had the fried onion rings and they were the ultra thin strand ones and full of flavour. No need to add more seasoning as the salt and pepper was just right. The burger we chose was the classic \"Our Burger\". It was juicy and flavourful but much smaller than your average restaurant burger.

Three stars. Plus one for really good service. It was a quiet Sunday evening during the visit and the restaurant was mostly empty."}
{"text":"Just another burger place nothing to brag about just that we ate here that's all . Parking sucks trying to get here ."}
{"text":"Be prepared to shower after you leave here as you and your clothes will remind you of Wahlburgers long after you leave...like a bad hangover after a late night in the bar.  Apparently Mark W. was in town on Sunday 12/17 for the Steelers/Pats - he managed to get to the box but should have gone to his newest installment of his family restaurant chain.  Loooong wait, on a Wednesday night, which I get as it is new.....that said, so not worth the wait.  We had hoped to really enjoy - this was my nephew's choice for a belated bday celebration - what a disappointment!  A few of us ordered the \"our\" burger and expected it to come with the toppings they list...only came with cheese.  When we asked the \"manager\" about it, he said (all with a cheesy and disingenuous smile) that we should say we want it \"set\" going forward, and that we would stump his staff if we said that.  How would we possibly know this?  We had a party of 7, some burgers (not \"set\") and some chicken.  The chicken was good, nothing special.  The onion rings were like French's canned onion strings.  We weren't given any utensils.  Oh, and did I mention that not only was the wait long, the wait for the food was even longer....and we were served the wrong dishes, all seven of us...nothing comped, no apology from the management on the late, wrong food or the \"set\" burgers.....the funky bunch has its' work cut out for it...."}
{"text":"We visited twice and both times it was just ok.  Nothing very special or memorable.  I was expecting more.  Sweet potato tots were tasty if you like those.  I really don't understand all the buzz?"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, fries, and tater tots in a nice, green (yes green!) restaurant.  Our server was nice, and we enjoyed the visit.  Only downside was that the restrooms are outside the restaurant, and it was chilly outside.  Did not like this part."}
{"text":"Stopped because of the name.  Food great service not at all. Just watched a waitress clean off a table, she used the menu to clean off a plate into the trash then just put the menu on the table. Had to ask twice for our waitress after we got our food. Agin food great. Services sucks. 1/2 star."}
{"text":"Had their burgers today, Nasty taste and very greasy. Service was bad! And photographer gets mad as hell with you if you don't buy the pictures she is selling ! Bad food ! Bad service !"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant as I am  a fan of the television show on A&E. There wasn't any wait time to be seated, our waitress was polite. After viewing the menu I realized there weren't any turkey burgers served. I wasn't in the mood for a portobello mushroom burger, so I tried the Mac&cheese and an order of fries. It sounded appealing on the menu with multiple cheese's throughout it. And you can't go wrong with French fries. Boyyyyyy I was so wrong. The fries were cold and oily which was disappointing. So, I dove into the Mac& cheese all for it to be completely cold. For it to have four different cheese's in it I couldn't tell at all. I made the waitress aware of my displeasure about my order. She brought me back a different cup of m&c that was drier then the first order. I was done after that as I usually don't send my food back to the kitchen. Paulie was right when he said the quality of the food might suffer if they opened to many chains. $13 bucks for fries and four bites of m&c. Believe me I'll never try another Walburger's unless Donnie Walburger pays for it. Lol He's handsome:-)"}
{"text":"We had been waiting to try for a while. We like to let a place settle in before doing so. 
I am disappointed to say we can take it off the list. Food came out super fast. My Ourburger did not have the ordered tomato. 
It was as if burgers were being held. They were tepid at best. No warmth or flavor to speak of. The onion rings were awkward as they came out in a huge basket and no easy way to eat. They too were not hot as if they had just came out of a fryer. Even the Diet Coke was off. Neither of of us finished anything. Rather than worrying if we needed a to go box, they should perhaps worry why neither of us ate much. 
Would love my time and money back.
Oh, and a domestic bottle beer was $5. I know we were next to the Q, but we weren't in it."}
{"text":"Went there with family from out of town.  For the price we paid, I expected better.  Honestly, Red Robin is way better than this place in taste, variety, and value.    The burgers are small ad run about $12 (just the burger) The side of fries is an additional $5 and the drink is $5.  I ordered a hot dog for my 2 year old; $7.00 and it tasted vegan.  Our meal for 3 adults and 1 child was $85.00 (yeah I did a double take too).  I guess we paid for the hype.  I can put this one on my \"been there, done that list\".  Should've waited the hour at Giordanos instead :/"}
{"text":"Took a VERY long time to seat, but food was well worth it! Burgers and chicken sandwiches were great, onion rings and fries were amazing! Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Diners beware-- my bartender girl- Christal- 
tried to add $12 extra dollar to my tab - thinking I wouldn't notice cause I was busy working while eating-- SHADY PLACE .. wanting to speak to manager but none available this late- be sure to check your receipt and what her handheld payer says- tip options are later so be careful! Would not recommend this place .. yes it was close to closing time- at an airport - but all bartenders and workers definitely treated you like you were an annoyance - they don't close for another hour still-- very upset---"}
{"text":"I had one of the best chocolate shakes ever here. It's hard to describe, but hands down the best. Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction would be envious. The hamburgers live up to the hype on the show. Not the best ever, but top 5 for sure. The bun, pickles, government cheese and meat. Give the burger a try with caramelized onions. It is a winner. Location is a bit off and sad. Kinda hidden in a no name plaza with no name stores. But at least Starbucks is next door to help with the food coma of overeating all those sweet potatoe tots"}
{"text":"Was in town for the Jay's game Aug 9,2016 with my wife and 3 girls. After seeing the show and the enthusiasm Paul had for the restaurant and food quality the Toronto location was a HUGE disappointment. I knew pricing was going to be high / portion size small and might have to wait in line. Did the take out line and took the food upstairs. Restaurant as a whole was clean, larger garbage cans or openings the size of the tray's would be more user friendly, and the employees were pleasant. We made it before the dinner rush BUT;
the fries were cold, with no seasoning, not even salt
the chicken fingers were bland
the burgers were on the small side and I thought maybe Wayne Gretzky had slap shotted a few pucks across the street onto our plates they were so over done.
If you are headed for a game, eat at the venue, same price, more choice, better food."}
{"text":"Airport food options - with this context, sure a 4 star for me. We had about 30m to turnaround and they easily accommodated serving 4 of us very quickly. The food and service were both good. We were super hungry, but all 4 in our party gave very glowing comments about their burgers and I agree it was very tasty. Prices are as expected; in the airport nothing is cheap. They beer list is short and bland. They had 1 decent beer on the list from the partner Mill Street brewery but it wasn't available. 1 good alternative is to go directly to the Mill Street pub in the terminal where the food is comparable and the beer list is better."}
{"text":"Located in terminal 1, F gates.  What I liked most about this place is the power outlets at the bar area.  I was able to plug in and do some work while I kept my coworker company while she had some food.  I just ordered a drink when I was here.  Burgers cost about $10-$16 CAD here.

{"text":"I was in Vegas for a weekend getaway & someone in our group insisted we stop by at Wahlburgers for dinner. I ordered the, \"our burger\" & tater tops, the only change I made to my burger was adding jalapeños. The tater tops were nice and crispy but lacked seasoning. In fact, there was like absolutely no seasoning on the tater tops. My burger was a bit bland, however adding the jalapeños definitely added flavor to my burger. Great atmosphere & good customer service. I was a bit disappointed though, therefore only giving it 3 Stars. I would probably not stop by again if I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved the food, was fresh and hot. Loved the tater tots and Burger was really good. Staff were friendly and helpful. Portion size I found was good, as there was more than enough tater tots for my boyfriend & I to share. Come early if you want to avoid waiting in line like we did. Got right in and didn't have to wait. 

A good tip we got from someone is to eat in the upstairs take out area to save $ on the 18% gratuity. 

Some on here in their reviews have mentioned about the prices being gourmet Burger priced. Ummm it's a gourmet Burger place so I would expect to pay these prices. At Kelsey's, and this isn't a gourmet Burger place, with a burger fries and drink it would be about the same price. Not much difference. 

Wahlburgers had great food and service, will definitely come again."}
{"text":"The food was great ( not worth the price) I rather go to shake shack around the corner.
Please take note people who are reading this review... If your planning 
to go to wahlburgers vegas. ( not worth your time & heat during summer)
We have the courtesy to pay for your high food prices. But at least put a fricking bathroom inside your restaurant instead to have to share next door  Starbucks bathroom for there expense."}
{"text":"What's saltier than the tears of a fan that saw their favourite team lose? Nothing much, except maybe the nachos here. Salt is fine, but their tortilla chips tasted like they were bathed in salt water. 

Food aside, the servers are awesome. It's a nice place to watch sporting events, they've got multiple screens that usually broadcast multiple games. 

I've never seen this place to be particularly busy, so if you're looking to find a place to watch a sporting event without having to wait for a table, this place is a decent option. Maybe just stick to the drinks though."}
{"text":"Over priced frozen burgers. Stale buns, wilted brown lettuce. McDonald's type service and quality. Hey Wahlberg brothers stick to television and film leave the food industry to those who take pride in it..."}
{"text":"Was looking for something to eat late night and Wahlburgers happened to be open! Got there about 7 minutes before closing so you can imagine the level of service I received. I understand it was busy and they were about to close but they forgot about my order. Everyone that ordered after me got their order before me. Also, they had to ask me what I ordered again because it was a mess.

The staff, however was friendly. The food is decent. Not sure I would be back."}
{"text":"Went there last Thursday around 1:30 and there was a 30 minute wait. Once we were seated, we were greeted promptly and the server explained the menu. It took about 45 minutes from the time we placed the order until the food arrived, but we chalked up the long wait to the kitchen still getting in the groove after the recent opening. The food (two burgers, sloppy joe, tots and fries) was very tasty once it arrived. If you hate waits, I'd say give it 'til early February 2018 before checking it out."}
{"text":"How can you have a burger joint that doesn't take to go orders for 1? Thats all I thought about on the plane ride to Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered chili and fries. Nothing spectacular but cheap and filling. Service slow due to crowd."}
{"text":"I had a good experience at Wahlburgers. The burger was excellent, well-prepared and crafted, delicious tots and cold beer. My server Courtney (at the bar) made excellent recommendations and was a great representation of efficiency and personality. Cool place."}
{"text":"Ummm no. Just no. The Wahlberg brothers need to rethink this business investment. Let me preface this by saying that I didnt look at any reviews before deciding to eat here although I did notice the 3 star average when I checked in. I always form my own opinion after checking the place out regardless of Yelp ratings.

Located in the Grand Bazaar shops outside of Bally's Hotel Casino, the place looked packed when we came in on a saturday night around 8 pm. We were told that our party of four was a 15 to 30 minute wait. I gave the hostess my cell number so that she could text or call me when a table opened up. We walked around looking at some of the stores. Got a text 10 mins later so off we went.

Was sat down in a booth pretty much right in front of the counter where all the food was placed when done cooking. I got the Bbq Bacon Burger, my son got the Jenn's Chicken Sandwich, and my friend got the Double Decker. We decided to get Tots, Sweet Potato Tots, and Thin Crispy Onion Rings to share.

The Bbq Bacon Burger ($12.95), has a 1/3 pound beef patty, white cheddar, bacon, fresh jalapenos, house made bbq sauce and avocado spread. The waiter asked me how I wanted it cooked so I said medium rare. Burger was decent and was actually cooked how I wanted it. Didnt really wow me at any given point. Hardly any jalapenos and the bbq sauce was just ok. 

My son opted to have the Jenn's Chicken Sandwich ($11.95) as a salad for you have the option of making any sandwich or burger a salad with no price difference. The grilled chicken was cut up into small chunks, was tossed with mixed greens, carmelized onions, crisp onions, and house made honey garlic mayo. My son was not wowed either by the salad. I took a couple of bites and I agreed with him. It was no better than a basic caesar salad with grilled chicken.

The Double Decker (12.95) has two 3 ounce beef patties, lettuce, tomato, onion, \"government cheese\", Paul's signature Wahl sauce, and housemade pickles. It was basically a slider with two beef patties. My  friend finished it quick for it wasnt really all that big to begin with. She said that it tasted kind of like a White Castle burger. Thats not a compliment by the way.

The Yukon Gold Fries, Sweet Potato Tater Tots, and Thin Crispy Onion Rings ($4.95 each) were all very disappointing. All were lukewarm. Tots and fries were almost to the point of being soggy. Needless to say we only only ate about a quarter of the all 3 sides before realizing that it just wasnt all that appetizing. Just remember nothing on the menu comes as a combo meaning you dont  get a side and a drink with your burger. That blows. It only means that you are spending even more for a la carte items.

Service was just ok. Took awhile before our server would come around to ask if we needed anything. Not sure if he was pre occupied with so many other tables but I noticed plenty of servers walking around everywhere.

In closing, I dont think the 65 bucks I spent for mediocre burgers and lukewarm bland sides was worth it. Oh, did I mention that the soda I got was $3.95? How is a soda almost as much as an appetizer? The one thing that really bothered me was that I noticed that they already have the sides cooked ahead of time and are placed under heat lamps. This was in plain sight from where we sat. No wonder they were lukewarm and almost to the point of being soggy. I usually take home any leftover items so as not to waste any food but this rare occasion, we didnt want to take any of the sides home. Lastly, Bally's is in the process of putting up parking meters in their parking structure. Yay, more expenses before you even step foot out your car. Im putting this place in my \"One and Done\" portfolio. Not coming back and I dont recommend you even trying it for yourself. Go somewhere else that is worthy of their burgers and sides.

{"text":"Hamburgers are good  atmosphere is awesome!  We sat at the bar outside. It was so nice.  My favorite thing is the onion rings!!!!  My God all I thought about was going get more of the onion rings!!  Staff was very friendly and offered great customer service.  Wish Paul was there. My husband is a chef and soooo wanted to see Paul!"}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp.  I actually set up an account just to post something to let folks know not to waste your time.  Very surprised by all the hype this place received.  Food was sub par at best.  I expected a much better product. Save the travel and parking difficulty and stick to any other burger establishment. I can assure you any place will be better.   Only reason I didn't give it one star is because of the good service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday because we were craving a burger and had been wanting to try out Wahlburgers. It is a casual dining place which is kind of nice - \"to go\" type cups with a top and a straw, and food served in baskets. Definitely a fast place to go in and out. 

I got the BBQ bacon burger and sweet potato tots which were tasty. I'm not going to say it was the best burger I've ever had in my life or anything life changing, but it was pretty good. The avocado spread on the burger added good flavor, especially with the white cheddar and balanced out the jalapenos on it.

Our server Dakota was super friendly and efficient. Very good service. I'm not sure why people are complaining that it's expensive here-- $12.00 for a burger in Vegas is pretty cheap to me!"}
{"text":"The burger here was just average. Really nothing to make me come back. The fries that accompanied my burger were cold. Asked for water with lemon and the water tasted just awful. I love Marky Mark, but maybe he needed a funkier bunch to make this better."}
{"text":"Excited to learn a W's was in Toronto ... It was 11pm when i stopped in, bar tender was friendly and didn't seem bothered that I was showing up late with an hour till close.  The atmosphere was casual and clean with several TV's etc. 

Ordered a Coke with grenadine mixed perfectly... also ordered the OFD (Originally from Dorcester) 8oz beef patty, housemade tomato jam, bacon, swiss cheese & sauteed mushrooms. Came out looking great but first bite showed it was over cooked (well done & a bit burnt) and dry... maybe cook was distracted because it was late and I was the only order :/ if it had been medium cooked I think it would've been really good. Flavor was nice, tomato jam was bold but OK... probably would've liked BBQ sauce.

Overall fun experience and good enough food. Look forward to try it again."}
{"text":"Food was really good 10/10. But we had to wait so long for service at our table... really unprofessional"}
{"text":"Sloppy joe serve with one slice of bread and a small scoop of meat.
Shake served in a small paper cup, you pay extra for fries. Not happy with cost and serving size. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed.  My husband and I had watched a few episodes of the show so we were eager to try.  The restaurant was pretty empty so we had to put our name in for about a 15-30 min wait.  We were buzzed back after only about 10 min so that was cool.  It's a weird setup inside, as you have to wait to be seated, but there is also a walk up counter to order?  Super confusing.  We were greeted pretty promptly and our server took our drink order.  A few trips back, we got 1/2 our drink order, with the shakes missing.  The shakes came about 10 min after the sodas came and they were pretty melted like they had been sitting.  The food came shortly after.  We got the BBQ burger (Donnie's fav), \"our burger\", kids hot dog, and kids cheeseburger.  My burger wasn't really hot and the cheese looked like it was sitting under a heat lamp for a long time.  The BBQ sauce was really good though.  Other than that, I wish we would have gone somewhere else.  It's not worth the price and the service was just meh.  You live and you learn.  Wished Shake Shack wasn't so far down the strip as we would have much rather eaten that."}
{"text":"Being a fan of the show, I couldn't wait to try out the restaurant. My husband and I went in on a Saturday night around 6:30 and to our surprise got seated in less than 5 minutes. However, it took about 10 minutes for a server to come and take our order. Since we had waited so long, we knew exactly what we wanted and placed the order along with our drinks. Drinks came out in about 5 minutes but the food took over 25 minutes. We actually thought the server forgot about us. 

Once the food came out, my husband noticed they did not grill the onions like he had asked. And the meat on our hamburgers were quite pink. The server never asked how we wanted the meat cooked, so we assumed it was going to be cooked all the way thru. We still ate the burgers, and did like it, however I would've preferred the patty be cooked a little bit more. The tater tots were pretty good, crispy and well seasoned.

I'm only giving a 4 star because I was not impressed with the price. The basic burgers were overpriced at $9.95 and add ons were $1.00 more each (cheese, grilled onions). And they did not come with a side. Sides were $4.95. I also ordered a root beer and that was $4.95. Totally ridiculous! I wasn't eating at a gourmet restaurant, it was more like a sit down fast food restaurant. So the pricing was a bit too much.

Needless to say, we won't be returning anytime soon unless they include a side with the burgers. I could easily go to another burger place and order a cheeseburger and fries for less than $10."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat at Wahlburgers Las Vegas but was disappointed once I finally got to the restaurant. The service was almost no existent, no hostess at the stand, waited for 5 minutes before asking an employee who was wiping down tables if the sign was correct (it says please wait to be seated) so instructed to just go on in. Once inside it was clear that was not correct as a mother staff member sent us to the hostess who was inside chatting with 3 other employees. Once seated things didn't get much better the waiter failed to let us know about the new burgers (we discovered them on a sign after ordering, my friend is a vegetarian so we quickly asked to change her salad to the impossible burger). While waiting for our food staff seemed to be doing nothing but standing around chatting. When our food arrived the burgers were delish but my tots were a soggy mess and my friend's fries had zero seasoning to them. Once we asked for our bill it took our waiter over 10 minutes to bring it. In that time we observe him once again chatting with other staff. Good burgers, poor quality sides and lack of customer service. I wouldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Very clean. Food is food and fun place to hang!! Burgers are juicy and big. A must his spot when you come to Vegas. Ask for Vic he always there to help and provides great customer services."}
{"text":"The Burger is better than average. M little less lettuce would be nice but over all everything is great. Super fast service"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical because not everything a celeb puts their name on ends up being great... BUT THIS WAS THE BOOOOOOMBBBBBNBBB ... I got the chicken sandwich with no sauce (can't eat mayo) maaan but this chicken was sooooooo juicy and flavorful . I LOVED IT My bf got the original burgers .. ALSO SUPER DELICIOUS  YOU'VE FOR TO TRY IT IF TOU GET THE CHANCE"}
{"text":"The price forced the star rating down. Albeit, it is Vegas; but on the other hand, this IS Las Vegas we're talking about - there are far too many alternative food options to waste your hunger on dribble. 

The burger is pedestrian at best, and worth no more than $6; Ol' Marky Marky and his funky burger bunch'll charge you nearly double anyway. There's not enough salt, not enough decadence, and the burger is too dense. This \"government cheese\" motif got carried away with itself, and now your payin' Hollywood prices for \"government meat\" too; do we ever know what's in our burgers? I know what they all say, but who knows?

I'll tell you something though - I don't know how these goofballs did it, but their sweet-potato tots are a stroke of fuckin' genius! Give me a bucket of those, a handgun, and a masters collection of Wahlberg movies, and I'll show you a Saturday night proper!

$15 in on a burger and tots, and immediately I forgot the burger. Those tots will haunt you though. Why didn't I think of that!?! Oh well. They're building one in Kansas City this summer, so I'll keep you updated on whether they're price-gouging Vegas tourists, or if they're in-fact across-the-country delusional. Fat Burger down the street does it better for less money, if that's the sort of thing you're into. In-N-Out's customer service and flavor simplicity decimates Whalburgers - and against Whataburger's flavor and value, it's not even a contender.

Kansas City is already oversaturated with great burger options, so we'll see how quick they shutdown; if they bring that same nonsense I wasted my stomach on in Vegas to KC, It'll be swift and uneventful. I stopped in Alabama for my first Whalburgers, and they told me it would be an hour and a half wait!?! What? Not for a burger. No sir. Freddy's KC makes a spectacular steakburger, Chicago dog, custard shake, and a basket of fries in 5 minutes - In-N-Out does that in half the time. Step up your game, Son."}
{"text":"Man very disappointed with the quality of the food here. I love Marky Mark and I think I just had higher expectations. 

The burger was mediocre. All the toppings you had to pay extra for even the lettuce! The fries weren't crispy but soggy. The burger fell apart instantly. Even the Whalsauce was nothing special. 

Great location for tourist though so revenue must be good but with so many burger joints on the strip, you have to stand out."}
{"text":"Went here when we were in Toronto for the guns and roses concert. We went for lunch on the Sunday after.

Place was busy and we were seated pretty fast. I didn't realize at first that combos didn't exist at this restaurant until reading reviews.  No big. It was my first time so the experience was worth the inconvenience of having to pay a la carte.  I ordered the OFD burger and the crispy thin onion rings.  Really they should be called onion strings....  No resemblance to an onion RING what so ever.  The wife got a \"entree size Ceasar salad\" and tater tots. 

Staff was friendly and prompt,  which was surprising to me when I think of Toronto... 

The burger was good. Not visually appealing with the bun squished and mangled,  but non the less the flavor was great. The onion strings were a tad Greasy and no real batter to them.  Gf loved the tater tots but we both agree the Ceasar lacked in both flavor and croutons (3) dressing was water and very little to no real Ceasar dressing taste 

We had our experience at wahlburgers,  I can't personally say I'd go back... Maybe as a last resort on Bluejay way. It's between a 2 and a 3. I would give it a 2.5 but that's not an option so I'll be generous and give wahlburgers a 3"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. This is the 2nd time I've had poor service at a Wahlburgers.  1st time I sent an email to Corp with no response. This time I asked for a manager and got a supervisor of nothing. My bun was burnt so bad it was black and my patty was cold.  So disappointed that what once was my favorite place is no longer my favorite.

They remade our burgers and my bun was ice cold and hard and my patty was almost rare.  Just so sad to see that the hype on a&e is no longer what you get in person.

Maybe they should go back to basics of making a great burger instead of trying to be in every market or the world.

Insult to injury, just got our bill.  Was told the manager gave us a discount; but they dont have managers which is what the supervisor told me.  Our discount was a generic mall employee discount and then an employee discount. 

Corporate really needs to get their act together.  A famous name will only take you so far."}
{"text":"Had the fiesta burger, and was in love with the chipotle sauce in the burger. Was able to pick my sides and got half/half onion rings and fries. Atmosphere was nice and the servers had smiles on their face, saw managers checking up on everyone to see how their meal was, can't complain with good customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is leagues better than you'd expect, minus a few nits.

Wahlburgers is apparently famous on TV and is new to the Toronto airport.  In the airport, it sports both a fast food area and a sit-down area, and both are quite nice.  Think upscale sports bar.  Service is really kind and superb (and I have no idea why others here complain about it). There are a ton of plugs available for solo travelers at the bar, which is a nice touch.

The food here toes the line of perfection.  My burger - the \"Double Decker\" because I'm a secret fatty - was perfectly cooked in that tasty-greasy sort of way, but it didn't fit the bun (I had way too much bread and way too little patty, which is annoying).  The sea salt fries were spot on.  Both were priced at pretty much what you'd expect for an airport restaurant.

At the end of the day, this is a nice little high-ish-end greasy spoon in the airport, and I was pretty pleased."}
{"text":"This was my first time to a Wahlburgers!  It was a great way to spend time before our flight left to come home after a two week vacation.  We had burgers that were tasty and great service!  Here name was Amita!  She was friendly, answered our many questions and had a great welcoming smile!  She was a great server who wanted her customers to be happy with their visit!"}
{"text":"I had a great airport experience here. It's expensive but that's a given being at the airport. The service was fast and friendly and I thought the quality of the food was great. I love that you can make any burger into a salad and it still comes with all the fixings to make it taste great. The fries were fresh and crispy and the burger was delicious, too. There's lots of TV's and the bar is big and not too cramped. Overall, great airport restaurant/bar option."}
{"text":"Was surprised to see a Wahlburgers in Canada, and since I've always wanted to try their burger, I was excited to eat here.

I sat at the bar, and service was very quick. I had the Our Burger with no cheese. The burger was delicious and the Yukon Gold Fries were great too. 

I know a lot of people complain about the price, but I thought it was worth it. I can't wait until there's a Wahlburgers close to me in New York."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. Over $25 for a 8oz BBQ Beef burger, fries, pop with tip and tax. Burger was NOTHING special. Found it tasteless. Fries ok, to much salt. Service was lacking. Never even asked how the burger was. I would not go back. Yet I was excited to try the ones in Vegas. Think I will pass on the whole chain. Also it says on the menu that the burgers come medium. My burger was well done and dry. I know you can not serve a burger in the GTA medium, the need to change the menu."}
{"text":"First time I went was great. My second time however, I was extremely disappointed. I came with a group of 4 people. I asked for a sweet tea and the server laughed at me...said \"we don't have that, only unsweet\". We waited at least 40 mins and our food still didn't arrive. There were FOUR tables behind us that came in after us and they ALL had their food. We didn't have a large order or anything crazy. The server must've forgotten to put our order in. We got up to leave and our food was there finally and we declined and walked out. We told the server that everyone around us got our food and that we won't be eating here. She smirked and said \"sorry.\" Like she didn't even care. Never coming again. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Going to Wahlburgers was on my list for my first time in Vegas and it was great! I had the \"Our\" burger and it did not disappoint. The sweet potato tots were also great. I hope to go back again before I have to go home."}
{"text":"Rude waiters , did not make eye contact. Gave off the impression that they didn't want anyone there. But good food over all"}
{"text":"Not what I expected at all. Burger was good, but overpriced. Service was pretty crummy. Sat at the bar and waited for 10 min before anybody noticed me."}
{"text":"Pretty solid spot! It's definitely a tourist attraction and they give out free cups for their sodas and their milkshakes. My friend had the BBQ Bacon burger and she loved it! We also shared the onion rings which were great. As a vegetarian, I had the kid's Mac and cheese which was honestly awful but this is a burger place so I really was not expecting much. However, the shakes here are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food is pretty good. If you get the sweet potato tots, get it with the orange sauce (not sure of the exact name) the sauce is also good to put on the burgers. The avocado spread and caramelized onions on a burger is worth a try. I like that the restaurant is open late too."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place. But I was very disappointed in the service. I sat at the bar and they took at least 20 min to get my order.. I  only ordered a glass of wine and no food...they took my excitement right out."}
{"text":"Of course we came here for the name.. 
I got the thanksgiving day special and it was delicious. I would definitely get it again. The cranberry sauce gave it a sweet taste and the turkey burger was actually pretty tasty and not dry.  
My husband got the Our Burger and as recommended by the server, he got it medium. He said it was juicy and was very good. 
If burgers are your thing then you'll like this place. I did expect the burgers to be bigger, but it was actually smaller than expected. The bun was also cold and I expected it to be at least warm. 
We also had the grilled fluffanutta and ehh it was alright.. good enough for sharing. It had pb, Nutella and bananas warmed in between bread.. like a grilled cheese style. We got 2 special burgers, 2 double deckers, 2 sodas, 1 dessert, and a side of fries...total including tax was $75. A bit pricy if you ask me for a burger joint..."}
{"text":"Quick summary. Food was average. Service was average. Nice atmosphere. 

The standard size burger \"Our Burger,\" is really small. Dubbed the 5oz, it looks much smaller. Burger tasted great - just a small portion. Fries were nothing special. Seemed like standard Wendy's fries (even Wendy's may be better). And do not order the onion rings as a side. They aren't actually onion rings. It's a bowl of the shaved crispy onion pieces. Something that would go on a burger, not an actual side. He pricing is a bit much for this food. At the time of writing this, it's only be open for 2-3 months - not impressed. 

I won't be back. It's too bad. Had high expectations. I wanted to like it. They did have sub charging ports in the booth though."}
{"text":"Burgers were delicious and lived up to expectations. Could have used more wahlburger sauce. Onion rings were different (thin) and sooo good! Too bad the wahlburgers werent present."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The food was actually really good! I typically don't finish a burger when I go out to eat but I scarfed this whole thing down. Food was definitely affordable and didn't upcharge for sides that are included, all sides are a la carte (and you get a lot). Only downside is that this location is very small and the wait can up be to two hours."}
{"text":"Wow what a disapointment, I think we bought into all the hype and thought it would be great. I had the chicken sandwhich, way to salty and nothing special. My wife had the OFB and found it to rather normal. The service was very poor, we were only one of about six tables and the waitress was unatentive and rude. Had the tater tots and could have gotten a whole bag at Giant Eagle for the $3.50 they charged for one small cup, way over priced. The beer was very cold and Cosmo my wife had was very tasty."}
{"text":"We went on 10/6/16, the service was great and a good atmosphere, here is the but, the food was very underwhelming. The burger looked like a McDouble at McD's and the MAC n cheese was missing the most important element the CHEESE. The prices were to be what is expected I guess for the Las Vegas strip, our tab with tip was $52 for 1 double burger to share, with fried onions, fries, Mac n cheese and 2 beers.  We watch the show and thought there would be some heart in the food like the family.  Maybe Paul, Mark and Donnie need to pay this location a visit."}
{"text":"The Burger was  good .....however they did not get my order correct. 
I was not going to send it back as my time is valuable and did not want to wait. 

The noise level was horrible and service was slow."}
{"text":"Where do I start? 

The onion rings are very tasty. I wish they were full sized but they are shaved which is fine, you just need to grab a handful at a time. 

The burgers are high quality. The ingredients are fresh and overall delicious. 

They have regular tater tots and sweet potatoes tots. Both are excellent

My wife ordered a salad with grilled chicken she gave me the thumbs up (she's hard to please) so this is a good sign.

I would recommend Wahlburgers to anyone wanting an above average burger experience. 

Did I mention they have a full bar?"}
{"text":"As a local this spot is a little hard to get to. You have to park at one of the casinos & walk to it, but it is well worth it. The burgers are surprisingly delicious and filling. It's crowded every time I've come but I can usually always find a spot at the bar right away. The prices are high but the burgers make up for it, so does the staff. The bartenders are very attentive, especially Courtney who has waited on me numerous times. She has made some great recommendations and always provides great conversation. I try and always make excuses to go to the Strip and get me some wahlburgers."}
{"text":"Great food and environment. Burger was well cooked and sides were amazing. Would recommend any of the favorite burger plus the tater tots. Location is open until 2am so plenty of time to come and enjoy."}
{"text":"Had our first visit to Wahlburgers today. Of course, there was a wait for such a popular restaurant. It was definitely worth the wait. Fast service, absolutely great food and very inviting environment. We will be back with friends and family. Great job!"}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed my meal here. Very friendly service, didn't take long to get our food at all, and for the price it was a good burger! Cooked the way I asked for it and without a ton of grease. 

I just got their basic burger on a gluten free bun. The bun was a little big for just one burger, but it still was delicious. Good quality meat, and I really enjoyed that after I ate their burger I didn't feel like I ate a pile of grease. The tots were fine - they weren't anything exciting, but that's OK. 

By husband got the OFD burger and enjoyed it. It may had bacon and lots of toppings, but he really liked it and would definitely get it again. 

We got their grilled cheese sandwich for our son and it was a perfect size with plenty of cheese - he was definitely pleased with all the cheese!

It was good. I will definitely go back again and try one of their signature burgers instead of just their basic burger. They also have gluten free buns, bread and croutons, so I think a patty melt is in order! And they have the classic MA lobster roll buns browned on the flat top with some butter on it, so if you want a hot dog, I'm sure it is great!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  A little pricey for burgers.  However now i can say I ate at Marky Marks joint.    Do have to say the chili on the burgerbwas a great add on."}
{"text":"Very disappointed been wanting to try this place for so long after seeing the show. Too bad it is fast food quality at best, nothing unique about it. Shame on you paul, shame on you."}
{"text":"Awsome service, fun establishment. We have been watching this show for a while now and was super excited to see that they put one in Vegas before our trip here. Quality and taste of food is great. Price will always be high because well it's Vegas. But you get quality ingredients with this food so I always expect to pay a little more. Great job guys."}
{"text":"If you want a good burger, AVOID. This is literally a pimped up mcdonalds. The buns are severely fake. The meat is absolutely tasteless and you don't feel the same grilled meat taste as with Hero Burger. I was asked if I wanted cheese and I was given the options. I then asked for the white cheddar and was told that is $1.30 extra. Quite a lot for a transparent piece of cheese. Anyway, I didn't want to pay, so I settled for the regular American cheese. Big mistake. This is the same plastic sad excuse for cheese they put on mcdonalds. The whole burger was really bad and I ended up throwing 2/3rds of it away. I also ordered a poutine with the Yukon Gold Fries. The poutine was also pretty bad. Very cheap on the cheese curds, the gravy was too thick and strange and the fries were not nice at all. They just have a slightly nicer presentation than mcdonalds which is why it seems popular. I spent $17 and threw most of it in the garbage."}
{"text":"Here for a poker tournament at JACK casino, across the street.
I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and made it into a salad!
5:00 PM on a Wednesday, fast friendly service."}
{"text":"The burger was really good, but I was also surprised by their very good beer selection for ipas. Service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place gets so much hate. I always try to stop at all the non-corporate eats, but by golly miss Molly this place is pretty neato. 

Not only do they have a ton of dope drafts and beer bottle choices, but every server I've ever had is super nice and very willing to help suggest the best items for you. The food comes out hot and fresh, and the onion straws are unique and super tasty. My boyfriend is a fiend for the Wahl sauce (like he gets like 8 and devours them with fries and onion straws), so it's definitely safe to get that. The fries are thick and chunky but definitely groovy. Every burger I've ever had is superrrr juicy, well seasoned, and will melt in your mouth. 

Don't pass up a great burger joint because of a few high maintenance disgruntled fans ;)"}
{"text":"Well let me tell you as a self proclaimed BLOCKHEAD and loving NKOTB for 28 years I wanted to love this place and visit weekly. My dreams were shot down during my visit. We were told the wait would be about 35 minutes but it was actually only about 15, score right? Well that was the only good thing. We were seated and greeted about 3 minutes later by a super nice waiter, we asked for ice tea only to be told they didn't have any today. BUMMER. We ordered 2 waters and a cherry coke. 2 of us ordered \"the our burger\" one with french fries and one with tater tots, my mom got the \"dads basic burger\" with a side of thin crispy onion straws. Our wait for the food was about 20 minutes which isn't to bad except it was all ice cold and everything we wanted off or on our burgers was incorrect, the internal temperatures were also wrong. On try two, 2 of the burgers toppings were correct but one was still wrong and my burger was still raw and not well done so it went back a third time, when it came back it was all of the sudden a double cheeseburger with everything on it. I kindly asked for a takeout box to take it to my husband because i wasn't trying it a 4th time. I understand that they have been open for under two weeks but I refuse to believe it's this hard to get hamburgers correct, I mean it's a small menu and I refuse to believe that the kitchen is still working out the kinks. The manager did take my burger off the bill and then cut the remaining bill in half and it was still $23. The real total would have been over $60 for 3 burgers and 3 sides and one soda. Save your sanity and money and go to In-n-out!"}
{"text":"Burger was great! Good size as well. Side of skinny onion rings was good size too. Pretty tasty. Soft drinks were expensive but it's Vegas so that's expected. At least you get a souvenir cup. Seated quickly. Friendly staff. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was poor as the wait was very long. In all fairness, they had only just opened and they were exceptionally busy and they did not have the staff to handle the demand. I went back - although I told myself I never would - as I really want this place to be good. My second visit was much better. Our server was very knowledgeable and professional and the food was good. I have updated my rating from one star to three as this represents an average of my two experiences. I'll likely go back but I'm not ready to recommend this place to out-of-town folks just yet!!!"}
{"text":"I am fan of the show and my first time at Wahlburgers. There was a 30 min wait, so we sat at the bar and ordered. Great suggestion from the Hostess. Order the OFD best burger I have had so far. Thin Onion rings, the food was brought out less than 20 mins The service was friendly and they had great options or suggestion. We will be back in Vegas soon and I will be back."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place and we were not disappointed. Food was very good and service excellent.  
Hope they open a Wahlburgers in SoCal."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Yes the restaurant was busy. The waitress took our order, then we didn't see her again until our party of four was 1/2 way done with our meal, my son walked over to the bar and retrieved his own soda refill. I kept the evil eye contact until she finally came to our table at that point I let her know that our order was incorrect and my food was cold. Her initial reply \"I'm busy\""}
{"text":"The service is absolute trash! The waiters and waitresses know nothing about customer service. It took us 20 minutes to get a table because all the hostess did was talk to her friends and never bothered to seat us. We waited an hour for our food only to find out they lost our order. No one assists you and the workers just talk and mess around. Definetly the worst service ever and not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Drove from Columbus to eat here. My husband and I have been dying to try Wahlburgers. Food was great, service mediocre. Drinks from bar were terrible. First drink ordered they didn't have all the ingredients . Second drink tasted awful.
Atmosphere was not impressive. Overall disappointed for the long drive for a hamburger."}
{"text":"Just what I thought it would be. Amazing and delicious! Didn't get to see Paul or Donnie tho."}
{"text":"Felt like frozen burgers thawed and fried. Might not have been but felt that way. Mediocre. Sorry that's just what I feel."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their reality show & Mark & Donnie as actors. I was so excited to try Wahlburgers when we went to Vegas. There was a 30 min wait when we got there. They took our phone # & texted us when our table was ready. We waited maybe 15 mins. Our server was William. He was very polite & charismatic. We ordered the Our Burger w/regular tater tots & the BBQ Bacon burger w/sweet potato tater tots. The sweet potato tots were a little mushy. The regular tots were crunchy & crispy though. The burgers were good. They did mess up the order on one of the burgers, but fixed it immediately. A fresh burger was out for me w/in mins. Overall, great experience & good food."}
{"text":"We love coming to Vegas because it gives us a chance to try so many places that we do not have locally.  Wahlburgers is one of these places.  Located outside Balley's Wahlburger has a togo stand close to the strip sidewalk and a sit down full service bar farther back in front of Balley's.   We went to the sit down full service spot cuz at 106 degrees outside we were seeking shelter from the Vegas heat.  I was expecting a cafeteria style setup but found out it was full service with servers waiting on you and bringing your food to the table.

The menu consisted of sides, salads, burgers and some sammies.  I tried the Sloppy joe which was soft open faced bread covered in a sweet meaty joe sauce and topped with cheese sauce and crispy onion strings.  The joe was delicious and fairly filling at $11.95.  We also had a order of onion strings which were crispy sweet red onion perfection at $4.95.  Wifey had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger  with avocado and jalepeno $12.95.  My wife was underwhelmed by the 1/3 pound burger and probably should have ordered a larger burger.  Soft drinks are $4.95 but come in a hard plastic collectible cup, which makes for a nice free souvenir.  A photo person also comes around and takes a free photo in the hopes of up selling you a souvenir photo.

Overall, I really liked Wahlburgers and will be back to try some more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Sooooo excited to have finally tried this place. I'm a diehard NKOTB fan so, quite obviously, once I heard that Donnie, Paul and Mark were going to expand their chain all of the way up here to Toronto- the countdown commenced..... more than once because the opening date kept changing, but whatever.
Anyways. The day came. I had checked out the menu online, so I knew roughly what to expect. The restaurant is clean and bright with lots of homages to the two celebrity brothers plastered all over the walls and televisions. It's fast food meets sports bar meets cafeteria meets sit-down restaurant. Nice, casual vibe with friendly staff- but the seating is lacklustre and spaced a little too closely together. The seats are lime green and feel cheap. They sell merchandise, but it's nothing special and slightly overpriced.
Now- down to the food. 
Firstly- it came quickly. No more than 10 mins tops.
My boyfriend had a burger with sweet tater tots and I had the melt sandwich with French fries.
Burger- flavour was good, bun was good, meat was slightly overlooked and dry. 7/10.
Tater tots- slightly warmer than room temperature and wish they had a crispier texture. 7.5/10
The Melt- 10/10. One of the bed sandwiches/burgers I've ever had in my life. 
Fries- comparable to Burger King. Crispy and flavourful but over-salted. 7.5/10

I would 100% go back and try something new. I think it's adorable that they have their mother's pasta salad as a menu item. Jenny McCarthy also has a chicken sandwich on the menu. Too bad I hate Jenny McCarthy.

An automatic 18% gratuity is added to the bill, so just don't be surprised when you see that circled in pen by your waitress when it's presented to you."}
{"text":"Not worth it. 25 minutes it took to get a $20 tasteless burger and vanilla milkshake. How do you make a tasteless milkshake?  Burgers don't come with fries or any sides for that matter. You have to order a side dish at full price. Our table ordered The mac and cheese and you literally get pasta and cheese. No seasonings. The whole menu concept is weird. I was with a group of 3 and we ate out on the patio which i will say was very nice and scenic. Plenty of space outside to eat and relax. Inside the restaurant is totally opposite. It's the same layout as a food court or a Five Guys eatery. Inside has limited seating, but i guess the perk of eating inside is that you get look at the movie/tv show posters that they starred in which are literally next to the bathrooms. Wahlburgers is great for tourists who don't know any better. There are plenty of burger spots in Cleveland that are far better and tastier for that price."}
{"text":"Marky Marky's did not disappoint. I had the Fiesta Burger which was recommended by the waiter and it was bomb.com! Had the spiked strawberry lemonade which was great also. My husband had the Mama sloppy joe (a first for ordering in a restaurant) and he said it was better than he ever imagined it would be! Service was fast and efficient. It was decent priced for Las Vegas we will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Yeah I watch the show and that's what drew me here. But I was pretty disappointed with the overall get for what you pay. 2 of there specialty drinks - moonshine for me, and I forget what my wife got, which were about $12 each?? a jack and Coke ($6), and a cheeseburger ($14?), and Mac and cheese ($8), with tip it was about $62-4. Nothing was that great. Burger was actually kind of dry, not very juicy. Good location. Though with a lot of other stuff around."}
{"text":"Overpriced average burger place, with cold fries that are not cooked to order and sit out in a heat lamp, I won't be back you pay for the name and not for the product..."}
{"text":"You can't go to Vegas and not come to this place! The burger here was so good. I got the triple stack burger and it was well worth it with a side of fries. I also had a michelada as well and that was great. Our server was good, but I felt like he rarely checked on us until the bill was needed. Overall a great place!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the reality show as well and I happened to be here so I had to try it. The server as well as the hostess were both very helpful and friendly. I got the Mac & Cheese (no, I did not get a burger) but the dish was delicious. I went with 3 other friends, all of whom did not want to try this place and they all had burgers and said it was the one of best burgers they ever ate so it was positive all the way around. I also had a Chocolate Strawberry shake which was so good and tasted exactly like Chocolate Covered Strawberries... plus I got to keep the glass which was very cool! I would love to try more items on the menu so I will have to check out this place again!"}
{"text":"I came here because I love Mark and Donnie Wahlburg. I wasn't expecting it to be good as I've heard a lot of bad reviews but to my surprise I enjoyed it a lot. Who knew pairing taters with burgers would taste sooooo good!! I was in love immediately. I ordered the Our Burger which is Paul's favourite so it had to be good. The burger was cooked to perfection. Wasn't dry and really juicy. I'm talking bout dripping juice lol. Next time I come I would def try another burger and the sweet potato tots. I can't wait!! 

My husband and I came around 2 and it was still packed so expect a crowd so expect to wait a little or if u get lucky U can sit by the bar. The service is great super friendly. The store is crowded but surprisingly it's not messy."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been a few times and the bad reviews are not deserved.   

I've had several menus items and likes them all.  My favorite being Jenn's chicken sandwich.  Wow was it great.  

Service can be a little slow,  it everything is made from scratch!  What do you expect?   Totally a fun chain that people see as a novelty, but they produce quality food most of the time.  

Give it a shot, just not on a day the Jays are playing. It's packed from pregame diners."}
{"text":"I had the Melt (added tomato) and it was really good. We didn't have to wait for a table at 1pm which was great! I'd come back again..."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the burger or service. Burger was very small for the price, was dry and lacked flavor. The server did not refill drinks and we had to wait for her to get up from her break to pay the bill.  This was a once in a lifetime experience for me."}
{"text":"We had to send our burgers back!!!

My bread was ice cold.
Our beef was cold and raw (wife is pregnant...e.coli risk eating undercooked meat), asked for them well done...got rare.
Then it took forever for them to come out of the kitchen the 2nd time. 

Wahlberg brothers....they need your supervision here in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Went here after the Browns game. Someone tries to seat us. Takes us to one side of the place where there are empty tables but no clean ones. So we go back towards the door and go to the other side where again there are no clean tables. He gets a rag and cleans our table. While we are waiting for someone to come, someone else tries to seat people again at dirty tables and has to get a rag to clean them. We get a male server who takes our drink order. In the meantime, someone grabs the checks and tips from dirty tables but doesn't clean them. We wait a while for the waiter to come back to get our order. As we are waiting, I think about the dirty tables and the staff who are just standing at the front door area. We decide to leave. I leave money on the table to cover the sodas and we go. No one approaches us as we leave to ask why. As we walk down the sidewalk we see our waiter and another guy OUTSIDE carrying a check and some money with it grumbling about a tip or something. I do not want to go to a place where the staff goes after people who don't tip them what they think they should get. Tips are for service; which we did not get."}
{"text":"By far one of the best sloppy joe sandwiches I've ever had. Such great food and service. My fiancé had the haddock sandwich and that was also amazing!! The manager Jnr and his bar staff were super kind and very helpful. My lady had asked for some wahlburger memorabilia for her mom and Jnr went above and beyond what he needed to do to get it for her. He even signed the bag out to her mom, threw in a beer cup and some stickers!!! We will definitely be coming back!!!! Thank you very much WAHLBURGER LAS VEGAS!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good! My 1st meal was replaced for a hamburger with onion strings the rest of my party was also satisfied with their meals. Prices are a little high other than that it's ok I would probably not go back soon. Nice to have experienced after watching the show."}
{"text":"We just got back from a wonderful trip to Vegas and decided to give Walburgers a second try.  The first time we were there they didn't have their official opening yet and walked out of there thinking \"ok, new restaurant, maybe it will be better later\".  Our second trip was a year later and decided to try it again.  Curly fries were greasy,  hamburger was so, so.  I've learned my lesson and will not go back again.  Pauly, get your brothers out of the restaurant business and get back to basics.  Love to Alma!"}
{"text":"I really had higher expectations for this place but was let down.  The burger patty was dry and quite tasteless. Fries were alright and probably better than the burger itself.  I won't be coming back here, at least not this location."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Couldn't speak highly enough of this place. It very much lives up to the  hype. So impressed and we will be back for sure! Juicy burger, best bun ever and the special sauce was fantastic. Tots were crispy and the drinks were on point. Super friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst place I have ever been. So bad that not only will I never eat at this restaurant again, but I will never watch a show that has to do with mark wallberg again!

This place gave me food poisoning causing me to miss a trip I booked and losing me 100 dollars for that trip. 

This place I found a few human hairs in my food and my lady found it in hers as well. The waiter didn't seem like he gave a shit about that either. 

The menus were torn up and horrid looking, the location was sub par, and the service was horrible. We got seated and didn't see anyone to help us for 15-20 min when the place was extremely slow.

To the wallberg family, congrats on riding your famous brothers name to start a restaurant, but you are tarnishing his name so you should close your doors."}
{"text":"Went here to find a burger and was very disappointed with what I received I paid almost 17$ for a jack in the box quality burger. Also not very good service. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Wait wasn't as long as they said which was a plus. Service was ok. They messed the order up which made food take longer.  Ordered burger medium came out well done, and average at best."}
{"text":"We tried this place 2 different days in the beginning of the week. Tried their mint, lime, with vodka & cucumber it was delicious! The Paloma drink has tequila & grapefruit. I had the hearty melt burger. Food was fantastic. This burger does not come on a hamburger bun. They serve on a large size toast. Atmosphere is nice. Place is clean & the staff are friendly. On our second visit our order was messed up but they fixed it and gave us a discount. Well worth your visit!"}
{"text":"First time at Wahlburgers and it was great! It's not expensive and the burgers are amazing. Also, the staff was super friendly and made some great suggestions. We really enjoyed our food. To bad there isn't a Wahlburgers in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"We've been there twice in the last three days I've gotten the double decker twice and I love it so juicy just so good. My wife got a shake it was good. Tots where over cooked to crunchy for my liking. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Suggestion: on Friday and Saturday they need to stay open till midnight. Wanted to go after an Indians game and they closed at 11, way to early for a weekend night."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Staff was friendly, service fast and the food was fresh! Burgers cooked to our liking. The Yukon fries are delicious but the Sweet Potato Tots are tops!  Loved the food and service so much, went back the very next morning for breakfast! Best burgers in town!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! I wished there was a bit more to the menu, but I also understand that having less items keeps you on your A-game with the quality. I ordered the cheeseburger. The sauce was great, although I have no idea what it was. The best part of the meal were the onion \"rings.\" Really they are onion strings or straws, but who cares because they were delicious! Quite salty, but excellent batter and seasoning! My friends ordered the macaroni and cheese and added chicken. The pasta was a penne which threw me, but the chicken was seasoned with something and delicious. It looked like a side dish, because it came in a to go side cup, but was very filling according to my friends. I just had a bite. Prices were steep, but maybe just because of the Vegas location?"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Wahlburgers first was in Vegas second was here in Cleveland. Luckily Cleveland was 46 degrees cooler outside at 72. 

I got the triple 1/3 burger cooked medium. With the special sauce which is like a big Mac sauce. Very good. Homemade pickles are incredible and worth asking for extra. Side of fries which is great. 

After eating all of that we decided to get milkshakes I chose good ol' chocolate. Which was really good ice cream, which is key. Very thick with small straws so that made it difficult to consume at first. 

They have a full liquor license too, and around 10 beers on tap including their own Wahlbrew. 

Only negative was my unsweet tea was sour so it seemed to be a little old, not a big deal I needed more water anyway. 

Great place to go before or after a ball game in town. TV's at the bar too if you don't have tickets."}
{"text":"Been dying to check this place out. Missed the one in Boston by a week. Was there right before it opened. Had a great burger and fries. Tried a double Paul's favorite with a gluten free bun. Bun seemed like it was made in house and Paul's special sauce was great. Go here for s great burger. Pretty comfortable outside with overhead mist spray even at over 100 out"}
{"text":"It wasn't too crowded when we came in last night (9 ish on a Monday night) but we waited and waited before someone, not even our server, came by and took our drink order. On the plus side, at least SOMEONE took care of it and our actual server came by soon after for our meal order. 

My sweet potato tots were soggy and... not very good... but my husband's regular tater tots were crisp and really good. 

The burger is where Wahlburgers stands out. We both got the Our Burger and it was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was juicy and everything you want in a good burger - not tough, dry, and flavorless like most places. 

The burger kept my review from being a 4 star review."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, terrible service. My friend ordered a burger and fries and an alcoholic beverage and I ordered a milkshake. Burger and fries were pretty fast and cocktail was made right away. My milkshake took 25 minutes.. My friend was pretty much done with her food before I even received my shake. We asked 4 different people to check on the shake until it finally came out. 

At the end, we mentioned to the gal who dropped off our check that the shake took unnecessarily long, hoping we could receive an apology for the wait. Instead she snapped at us with attitude stating that the reason it took long was because they couldn't find the milk - no apology. Than she decided to barite us with \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?! What do you want!!??\" 

Taken back, we just paid the tab and bounced. We didn't necessarily want or need to have the $7 milkshake taken off the tab, but a simple apology and some common decency as your customers. 

Would not recommend. Ever."}
{"text":"Very disappointed my daughter had a burger it was very thin and greasy I had portobello sandwich very small for  the price. Mac and cheese was good.The waiters and staff were very nice service was very good Portion are small and pricey."}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit to any Wahlburgers & I'm glad I went!  We were there for lunch & our waiter, Bill was the best!  He gave us his menu suggestions and the food came out just as we ordered it....with hardly any wait at all!  The burger was delish & the tater tots were nice & crispy.
We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great burger!  Warm grease running down my face and hands.  Wonderful flavor.  Pleasant staff.  Well worth the calories."}
{"text":"3.5 stars based on food taste and presentation as we did takeout instead of dining in. The basic burger is nearly $9, but for less than a dollar more, you can get the Our Burger, a 1/3 pound burger, beef cooked medium well, with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, \"government cheese\" (aka American cheese), and wahl sauce. The burger is served in a soft lightly toasted brioche bun which is ideal for sopping up some of the juiciness from the burger and sauce. Hubby and I ordered 2 Our Burgers and a side of fries. Although not the best fries ever, the thinly cut fries were pretty good and maintained much of their crispness despite a long trek from one end of Terminal 1 to the other. 

The novelty of burgers from the famous Wahlberger family is what prompted us to try this place (well, that and the fact that many of the other airport options by famous Canadian chefs are very pricy). They have some interesting sides options such as tater tots, sweet tater tots, salads, & macaroni salad. They have chicken and haddock dishes for those who don't eat beef. Burgers can be made sans bun, with lettuce as wrapper. Desserts like banana fluffernutta are reminiscent of comfort food desserts. Apparently gluten free options are available, as was a portabella mushroom cap and salads for vegetarians. However at $10.25 for a mushroom cap, I'd prefer to get the burgers which in comparison seem to be a better value (you can pay up to $12.45 to get a triple patty Our Burger). They also have an fairly extensive breakfast menu which ranges in price from $2.99 for a muffin to $13.99 for a Dorchester Breakfast or French Toast. Will probably be back to try some of Wahlburgers other offerings.

{"text":"came in around 930 pm and was told there was a long wait, even though there were empty booths. sat at the bar, bartender never awknowledged us, luckily the hostess tapped us on the shoulder and told us that we could be seated. fair amount of time to wait for food. food was good. ordered two adult frappes. pointed to them on the menu. after she stuck a straw in, pulled it out, and got a taste of my boyfriends frappe, she brought it to the table. she then said she had to personally make my fluffanuttah. weird, but okay. about 10 minutes later, out she comes with a sandwich, when we specifically pointed at the frappes. then she just says uhhhh and walks away. 10 more minutes pass and I hadn't seen her put my frappe order in but she brought me the bill. finally got my frappe, and luckily she didn't taste mine first. 80 dollars later, we were out of there."}
{"text":"Vinny, Eva and Jr. at Wahlburgers in Vegas ROCKED today!  The place was jammed and there were 2 empty seats at the bar. They were friendly and the service was fast. BUT that's not where these amazing people left it. The credit card machine was not working and we didn't have enough cash to check out so we had to wait till it got fixed. These 3 bent over backwards to make our sure extended stay enjoyable. When they did get the credit snafu fixed, they apologized for the inconvenience, which was CLEARLY outta their control, the gave us a discount on the meal and really made our first time at Wahlburgers a much more enjoyable and Memorable experience.  We never get this kind of service and quality in Binghamton, NY. Paulie, Mark and Donnie... these guys knocked it outta the park for us! Thank You All!!

{"text":"Visited this during a busy evening in a party of two.

Atmosphere: Modern and appealing!
The decor is modern with green accents. Definitely engaging with the modern-imagery. Nothing overwhelming, but many nice imagery and banners to look at in the restaurant.

Service: Nothing to complain about
We were served in a timely manner and our server was polite.

Food: Very nice!
Had the burger, onions rings, and macaroni and cheese. Everything was served warm, too! The burger was fresh and juicy. The onion rings, although not traditional, were still seasoned nicely and had their own type of soft yet definite crisp to them. The mac'n cheese was nice as well: seasoned and cheesy!

Summary: Worth a visit!
If you're in the Strip area and want a good burger and some sides, stop by and get a burger here! They also have a bar, too!"}
{"text":"Very new, clean, and tasty. Wish the fries were a little better. I would definitely come back. My babe loves burgers and so do I. Worth the trip for sure."}
{"text":"Got a doubleburger while waiting for our flight since i wanted to try a wahlburger.  Normally our fave used to be fuddruckers but those are gone.  Now we eat at 5 guys or the keg.

Burger was pretty good and juicy but pricey.  Think it was around $12 or 13 for a double burger.  Waited 10 min or so.  Staff were definitely grouchy and complaining to manager they wanted to go home since shift was over.  

Ok for a burger but next time gonna stick with other choices at the airport."}
{"text":"So happy we stopped here. First time eating here and we were really happy. We had a burger, hit dogs, tater tots and Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was amazing. Only had to wait 10 minutes and received a text when the table was ready."}
{"text":"We walked in Off the Strip. We were treated with kindness and excellent manners. The food was fresh and delicious. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Overall, glad I ate here. Mostly just to say that I did. The wait was about 30 mins for lunch, burger was expensive and there weren't a lot of options. But the workers were happy and attentive and the food tasted good. I got the BBQ burger and my brother in law got the Beast."}
{"text":"What can I say? Is it anything special? No. Is it cool to be there? Yea. The food? You get an honest to goodness good burger, exactly how you want it. Was very pleased and didn't leave feeling gipped. Good place!"}
{"text":"The double decker looked good and tasted average. The whole \"government cheese\" thing is lost on Canadians and when I ordered cheddar instead,it seemed to come out with American/what I would consider govt cheese. 

Beyond that, the service was friendly but slow (~30min to get our food)

The fries were solid though.

Say hi to your mother for me!"}
{"text":"The place was nicer than I expected. I was expecting a fast food experience but this place has a nice bar, waitresses etc.

I sat in the bar as I just wanted to grab a quick bite. It took forever to place the drink and food order. The place was busy. I ordered a triple decker, which is supposed to have \"over 2/3lbs\" of meat. Well, I got a burger with 3 tiny patties stacked on top of each other. Did not look like over 2/3lbs to me. The buns were tiny.

I figured it was going to be enough food anyways so I didn't mind too much. I started eating the burger and realized that this was one of the most boring and flavourless burgers I've ever had. It wasn't bad per se, but it really was so blah that I have no plans to go back. It really wasn't any better than a $3 McDonalds burger. I was expecting more from a $12+ burger (fries not included)"}
{"text":"This place is on the strip but you can't see it - there is a shopping area with cute little places and other little bars - it's behind that - 

So let me say this place is a hidden gem fresh cooked and unique flavors super delicious I highly recommend this place. Honestly the best food I had on my trip. If your looking for some good food at a reasonable price this is the place !"}
{"text":"Being big fans of the show, we had to come here while in Vegas.  I didn't have the best expectations based on all the other reviews here.

As for parking.  We parked at Ballys and the rates were 0 to 60 minutes: Free, 1 to 4 Hours: $7.  It was a short walk through the casino to get there.

We had 2 burgers, tots, onion rings and 2 drinks.  Bill was $50.

The food was decent, but nothing to write home about.  For half the price, we could have eaten at Shake Shack or In-N-Out and have been just as happy with equally or better food.

I have now eaten here once and would only go again if it were the one in Massachusetts.

On a side note, the souvenir cups our soft drinks came in were cool."}
{"text":"Decided to go here with family for a quick lunch. Checked in online and waited 10 mins after we got there. It was more affordable then I would have imagined. Food was good, but burgers were paper thin. Guessing most ppl go for the hype of it being on a TV show. We went right when they were opening so wait staff was a bit scattered but service wasnt too too bad"}
{"text":"I was very happy when Cleveland finally got a Wahlburgers so I had high hopes going in.  My father and sister had just went here a couple weeks prior to my visit and had a wonderful visit and my Dad said his burger was the best he's ever had. We went on a Saturday early evening and we were seated right away. Our waiter Dwayne was the best part of our whole experience. He was very nice, fun, efficient and went above what most waiters do. Three of us ordered well done burgers and specifically asked that we did not want any pink whatsoever. When our burgers came out 2 of them were not only pink but had blood coming out. Our waiter was very upset by them also having one of the burgers wrongly ordered by having lettuce on it when asked without but also because 2/3 were pink and bloody. Management wanted to discount the burgers that we didn't even touch instead of taking them off the check completely which was a joke. What food establishment DISCOUNTS food you don't eat that THEY screw up instead of removing it from your check? We asked to speak to management and they sent out their little manager not the head honcho. The worker seemed a bit nervous and scared I'm not sure why but as if he would be in trouble even though it wasn't his fault. They need new chefs working there if they want some more business. Dwayne was an excellent waiter he was personable, kind and very apologetic even though it wasn't his fault but the chefs. Management did end up taking the burgers off the check but that was after us requesting to speak to him. I'm not completely sure I would go back after this experience if I do it would be because the staff made us feel at home not because of the cooking. Get some new cooks in the back who know how to cook up a burger and who can follow some simple directions. Don't let the Wahlburgers name go down in the dumps just because of some crappy chefs."}
{"text":"Service: 5 stars. Food: 2 stars. 

First off, these are the most attentive bartenders I have ever seen. They are on top of everyone's drinks and ensure the bar is clean, something I always look at behind a bar. 

I ordered the BBQ Bacon and it was pretty good, but the jalapeno's were raw, which was strange. Grilled jalapenos would have provided a much better flavor. The bread was good and the meat cooked perfectly.

The onion rings were so bland. Even after adding a lot of salt, they were so bland and definitely not worth the additional $5. The bartender noticed that I did not even touch them...I thought he was going to take it off the ticket, but he didn't.

The Cucumber Lemonade was perfect. Very flavorful, but I don't know if it was worth $13. If it cost $8-9, I probably would have ordered another one. The Sam Adams was a tad on the flat side.

This place is WAY too expensive for what you get, especially considering how it is hidden from the strip. With a strip view, I could totally see paying these high prices, but not in this small, tucked in a corner location. For a burger, onion rings, 2 drinks, and tip it cost me $44. Unless the prices are reduced, I think I will go to Shake Shack the next time I feel like a burger."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Wahlburgers a few times since they opened a little while ago, which speaks to the quality of food. 

First and foremost, they use the No Wait app, so they win points in my book. The burgers are good and the ingredients taste fresh. We've run into some trouble with our burgers being cooked to order, but it was never so bad that we sent anything back. The service has always been good as well.

Four stars because of the a la carte menu style. You think you're getting a good deal for an $8 burger until you realize that fries are something like an additional $4 and mac n cheese is like $6. 

That being said, we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I really did not know what to expect walking in here, but I thought the atmosphere and seating would be more upscale and not so basic. I ordered the melt burger with a side of onion rings/straws. It was pretty good. My mother ordered the basic burger. She said it was nothing special. She had the sweet potato tat-or tots and those were good. It almost reminded me of a Five Guys restaurant but with sit down service here. The service was pretty fast and friendly for lunch time. Prices around 7-12 dollars just for the burger. A little high but hey it's down town Cleveland."}
{"text":"The double burger with GOVERNMENT cheese with gluten free bun was far better than most gluten free buns. Patty was good size cheese melted perfectly into bun. Tabor tots nice and crispy.  The Paul's fav was also great. Love the WAHL sauce. When thinkin about Wahlburgers it's got the RIGHT STUFF!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers were average, everything is ala carte - burger, fries, drink. I would compare this to Five Guys but with a bar and table service. Wahlburgers is a sit down restaurant but drinks and fries are served in paper cups like a fast food restaurant. There are better burger joints in Pittsburgh for sure."}
{"text":"I was at the Toronto airport and was surprised to find a new Wahlburgers in Terminal 1 (US departures).  Been looking forward to trying this place so this was a perfect chance while I waited for my plane boarding.  Wasn't sure what to expect since it was at the airport, but walking in the atmosphere was great, was greeted right away, asked to sit at the bar, great friendly service.

Started with a drink, watching the hockey game.  Then ordered the double decker burger and added fried onions and bacon, with fries.  The burger arrives, looks smaller than I expected for 1/2 pound burger, but the look is deceiving.  Along with a big side of fries I add some ketchup and mustard and get started.  The burger was fantastic!  To be honest I was a bit shocked as I didn't know what to expect from a restaurant chain started by Mark Wahlberg & family.  The burger meat itself had amazing flavour, bacon was perfectly cooked.  And despite what I thought was a small burger, it took a long time to get through it.

Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to visiting the other location on Blue Jays Way in downtown Toronto when I get the chance.  If you're traveling to the US and your at Terminal 1, this is the place to go for a great start to your vacation!"}
{"text":"Got the double burger; was okay. More for the name than the burger.

Burger was fresh not too salty but nothing crazy that makes you want to go back.

The portion of tater tots was good but too salty. 

For the price I had better but good to try out."}
{"text":"I came to Vegas to spend money. My friends and I chose to sit outside on the patio. Two of my friends had those super expensive tourist drinks. They say us took out drink order, we ordered a second round (the hostess was giving us the stink eye), my server was amazing.  Well anyways right after we all ordered food....some other hostess lady told us we had to leave due to our gimik drinks.....so if you are empty handed sure. But this is Vegas and this place does not play well with others. Find another more fun spot. Been in Vegas three days BY FAR my worst experience."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour and a half for our good once seated. Waitress checked on us once in that timeframe, only to get another round of drinks. Never updated us on delay on food. She took an attitude when we questioned the delay and why others arriving after us were getting food before us.  Good food but service is non existent."}
{"text":"Second tjne coming to this location. Can be a slight challenge to get to, if you haven't been to Vegas before. But it is worth it! Just make your way through the bar scene and get to the entryway of Bally's.

Food is fresh and made to order. Nothing sits around getting stale. Plenty of beer and alcohol on tap/available for any pallet. Food is always deliscious, and they have GLUTEN FREE bun options, Yes! I have been to this location and the one at Myrtle beach, and neither has made me sick in anyway, and I am very sensitive. Just ensure you do the usual emphasis to your server about it needing to be g-free. 

The menu is a stripped down city style burger joint type, witch offers many types of burgers, salads, sandwiches and more!"}
{"text":"Only come here if you want to experience racism at its finest. I was accused of having a counterfeit bill! The cashier didn't bother to use the counterfeit marker instead she looked at me ( a black man) and ASSumed. Once my bill did clear the manger of the place just apologized and continued to make excuses for her poor judgement as I watch several other customers come behind me paying with 20's and not checked. And the food wasn't worth the hassle. Never will go back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here after watching the show but was so disappointed. First off we were seated but no one came to our table to help us. We sat for 15 mins then figured out everything was a la cart and didn't want to pay $15 for burger $5 for side and $5 for a drink. We left and didn't eat anything."}
{"text":"My step dad had a great idea to stop up at Wahlburgers for lunch...what we didn't know is that they just opened yesterday on my birthday May 24th. We made the trip up on a rainy Thursday afternoon, party of 4. When we arrived it was only a 20 min wait...to our astonishment some people walked in, got the time and then left. It's a Thursday in downtown Cleveland and the night of a Cavs watch party for the Eastern Conference Finals, game 5. We sat down and initially there was some confusion but the manager promptly came over to take our order. We ordered fries, tater tots, sweet potato tots and the onion straws. My suggestion for the sweet potato tots is to get them extra crispy as they still (compared to the regular tots) are still a little soggy. The burgers were amazing and the buns fresh! I'd highly suggest trying this place out...yes there will be some initial growing pains on the service but it's next to Jacks Casino and the newest place on the block."}
{"text":"There's two different locations if u want souvenirs and some beer or mixed drinks 
I recommend going to the stand by the strip 
WAY LESS CROWDED. I loved it and thank you to my bartender that helped me so much with finding a drink to my liking her name was vanessa thank you girl I will be going back service was great and the drinks she whipped me up :) the stand has more of a chance to interact with you compared to the busy hectic can never find a seat restaurant"}
{"text":"After waiting 3 years, this place was worth it!  They opened it a little bit early.  I went the third day it was open. For a Saturday, we didn't have to wait very long for our table. We sat at a table under a big umbrella and sipped our adult beverages from the bar while we waited. They text  the person who's name the party is under when a table is ready.  It was about 40 minutes, but we knew they may have a wait so we  laughed and caught up  with each other while we waited. 
   
The  staff was very friendly, like meeting old friends. They took our orders and got everything right. The atmosphere is homey and fun,  like getting a  picnic table with friends  at a big party.  There are photos of the family everywhere . Lots of homages to each of the Wahlberg brothers and the rest of their family.  I especially enjoyed that they were playing 80s music inside. That was fun!

 The food was really good. I am one to enjoy an occasional greasy burger. I love it!  It made the flavor just burst in my mouth. Nothing was dry. It was just right. The cheese was right on time. We each ordered a side so we can taste a little of everything. The chilli was  on point. I loved the onion straws too. I really    I also had an adult smoothie. Get the S'MORES one! It's like the best chocolate milk ever! Smooth, delicious and  you can't taste the liquor.  

  We took lots of photos and had a really nice time.. 

It's so good, that I am going again tonight with out of town friends who are visiting. This is going to be the hot spot to meet friends and have fun when they visit!  You can also check out the merchandise store a  short walk away closer to the strip.  T-shirts, mugs, key chains, that sort of thing. I guess I know what everyone's getting this holiday season. 

 I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We attended about 2 hours before the jays home opener so expected it to be busy. Greater was miserable very slow and disorganized. Took 30 minutes to get a table even though at least 4 tables remained empty. Restaurant was clean and well decorated. Our server was extremely helpful, fast and efficient. Bucket of beer for $20 was a nice surprise. The food was excellent well cooked and arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. Onions rings / straws are fantastic. Was about the same price as eating McDonald's. Overall highly recommend."}
{"text":"Server was nice, but everything else sucked.

My bf got The Melt, tossed and the lettuce looked wilted, was drenched in  dressing and smelled like a sweaty arm pit. 

I got The Melt, as is. It was pretty underwhelming.

Side of tots: not hot. Was clearly sitting under a heat lamp.

Side of Avocado spread : had a floral taste to it, like soap. 

Side of ranch sauce: tasted sour like it stayed out too long.

Oh and they got our order wrong the first time around."}
{"text":"Can i just say how incredibly excited i was to find out there was going to be a wahlburgers in the west coast! 

Had such a wonderful experience. I was greeted by a nice gentlemen. Had a big smile that was contagious. Both greeters were very friendly. It was pretty busy, as i thought it would be but it was running very smoothly. The vibe was great and the food even better! 

I ordered the bbq bacon burger which was delish. The jalapeno gave it a nice kick. Im all into sweet and savory so this was the perfect balance.

Definately check it out! Your taste buds will love you!"}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas for our 25th anniversary. As we were walking down the strip we saw the sign and we had to try it out. The burgers were delicious and that's because I'm a picky eater. I would have given it a 5-star rating but the restaurant was crowded, loud, and the staff could have been a little friendlier. It's a little pricey but what isn't in Vegas."}
{"text":"Eh. Service was great, hostess and bartenders were friendly. I gotta say though, if a server asks ME if medium is ok for my burger, it BETTER come out medium. Cuz if that's what the kitchen is trained to do, so much so that the server says \"that's how we prepare them\", I consider it complete bs to get a well-done burger. At a BURGER place. Oh, and the Our Burger is the owner's favorite according to the menu so that's what I wanted to try. It's small...and $13. I think it's about the size of a famous star from Carls. Much better tasting, but definitely tiny for $13 a-la-carte burger. And did I mention it came out well-done? 

I'm a big fan of the show and respect the Wahlbergs for building a dynasty, but I think Paul would have been disappointed had he been sitting with me. There are actually more things I noticed that he'd probably want to know and correct (about the staff and time management at the bar especially), but not things I would post here. 

Good tasting food, good service. Underwhelming food. 2.5 stars and a bump for the cool staff."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! I had Marks favorite the Thanksgiving and I see why! It was soooo good! Turkey patty with stuffing, orange cranberry sauce, mayo and butternut squash. Honestly one of the best Thanksgiving sandwiches beside the Bobbi from Caps. Also had onion rings so thin and so good. Also had the Caesar Salad that fell short I wasn't a fan of the dressing or the ranch. They add balsamic or vinegar to it, it was kinda weird for me. But overall I will be back. We are locals so I get to come back anytime which rocks! Also Lucy was our server. She was amazing, so nice knowledgeable and patient! Great service."}
{"text":"I had the Our burger 1/3 lb with added bacon. It was excellent. Perfectly cooked. The bar staff were very friendly. Prob the best deal for a restaurant burger on the strip near Cesar's Palace."}
{"text":"As with a lot of people, my wife lives the Wahlburgers TV show. I travel a lot and was in Las Vegas on Business and she mentioned I should try. So I decided, why not I had a couple hours before launching out of town, so I stopped in. I had to wait about 5-10 minutes but that was mainly due to it being a busy Sunday.

I had the Original Burger, added Bacon, and ordereed the Onion Rings. The food came out quick and at first glance looked really tasty. The Burger was cooked exactly how I like it, the bacon was crispy, not over done, and all the vegetables (lettuce tomato, pickles,) looked fresh and healthy. The onion rings came out in a separate Basket which is large enough to share with probably two other people. 

The Burger was great. Cooked correctly, had lots of flavor and was close to something I would make at home on a grill. I had no complaints. The onion rings, were not as good as I expected. They were crisp, but really salty. I could not even taste the onion. The batter they use was light but so salty that is all you tasted was salted batter. Hence the loss of a star. 

I would really rate this place a 3 and 1/2 stars. The service was a little light. I do understand the place was busy but my server disappeared after my order arrives and really did not check to see if I could use more water or anything else. I mentioned the salty rings and he just agreed, but in a way of like, \"awesome right.\" Not how I was thinking. 

The real question, would I try again. Heck yeah. It was a cool place. I liked the Burger, the atmosphere and the vibe. It was really busy when I was there, so I can say light on service was understandable. The onion rings need tweaking, I hope that that is not how they are all the time."}
{"text":"I was very impressed. My expectations were not high but I really loved the Melt. The taste was good. It was fresh. There is a good dipping sauce as well. The BBQ burger was also delicious but I didn't read that it had jalapeños. Fries were good. Only downside was the Mac n cheese. It was just ok. All in all I'm coming back."}
{"text":"If you live west of the Mississippi you don't have too many choices to try Wahlburgers, so take this one when in Vegas. It's super busy, long line to get a table - so skip the line and sit at the bar! Yes, there is a full bar with seats outside (I've seen people sitting right next to their ton of luggage outside, apparently they didn't want to leave Vegas without trying this, or this is the first thing they came in to!). Either way, Marky mark and the funky bunch did a good job here, some of the best burgers I've had in a while and some of the best tater tots! Not too big, and not greasy, like other places that go for an easy please. The drinks service might be hectic since it's so busy at the bar, but the food comes out right away, which means that they keep it going in the kitchen when they have customers coming in like crazy. Great for a quick bite and a drink or when you want to enjoy a few with some good food while people watching."}
{"text":"Decided to check Wahlburgers out last night while my family is in the city. My brother-in-law is a fan of the show and I thought he'd get a kick out of being there. 

The place was packed and loud, but we were seated immediately and our initial server was great at telling us about he menu. He was quick to mention that the 18% surcharge on cocktails has been discontinued because customers were not happy with it. No shit!

There were 4 of us, a child and three adults. We each ordered something different, the Smallburger combo for my nephew $5.95, which includes fries. Then an Our Burger, the Crispy Haddock Sandwich, and the OFD. Sides were tatter tots, onions rings and, sweet potato tatter tots.  I also ordered a margarita and my sister ordered a Ceasar, both $12 each. 

We got our food orders fairly quickly. The Sides were the only decent things served. The haddock sandwich was burnt to within an inch of its life. Not worth the $ don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"Open faced sloppy joe is wildly insane. Went here while catching an Indians game (Go Tribe) because the one in Myrtle Beach was so good. Service was awesome! Food great and get the Mack and cheese. Add pulled pork. Awesome!"}
{"text":"First time at Wahlburgers. Quickly seated - few people here at 6pm on Thursday night. Wahlbowl chicken salad and sweet potato tots were good. Our little boy dropped his full cup of chocolate milk all over the floor ?!! Sorry!!! But they were nice about it and we cleaned it up. Great service!!"}
{"text":"Nothing good here 

Bar drinks are low quality with artificial syrups and burgers are undercooked 

It's awful but should appeal to the yinzer crowd"}
{"text":"A disappointing experience. I was hoping it would be worth the wait since I got the wrong order twice, but aside from the decor and TVs, unfortunately there aren't many positives. 

By far one of the most bland and tasteless burgers I have ever had. Perhaps I'm spoiled by Alberta beef, but I'd take Harvey's or even a McDouble over a Wahlburger. The patty itself contained a lot of \"less desirable\" parts of the cow. I suggest not looking at the meat after you bite into it. The top bun was glistening in oil, and the bottom bun was stale and partially frozen... Definitely not worth the $15 for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I thought the burgers and mac n cheese were super tasty, my husband however is telling me that I was too drunk to taste that it was mediocre. I would still go back, even sober."}
{"text":"I've got to start by saying that I was so thankful to check the Yelp app before heading over for burgers. It was late lunch on Saturday, and the app let me know that the wait would be well over an hour. Luckily I was able to reserve a spot on the wait list before I left my house. We checked in person with five parties ahead of us and were seated within 20 minutes.

The restaurant is smaller than I would've imagined it being. However they made up for it with the prices. Things capped at about $10, which seems like a rarity these days at nicer burger joints. The cheeseburger I got, which came with pretty amazing sweet potato tots, cost about 7 bucks. Everything was tasty and good.

So, was this a meal worth a two-hour wait, like some groups I saw outside? Hell no. But it was a good inexpensive meal, and hopefully a place I'd go to again once the hype dies down a bit.

Also, it wasn't until afterward that I saw they have a black and white milkshake, but that's on my list for next time."}
{"text":"I realize this location is fairly new, but I stopped by for lunch time right before a concert last Friday at the Q across the street. Went during the mad lunchtime rush, and was told there'd be a 30+ minute wait. Tip: if you don't care about eating inside, there is a generous sized outdoor area with a half covered patio with some covered tables that provide ample shade, perfect for those days with nice weather. Fairly straight forward menu with a variety of burgers and sides. If you're going with a crowd, highly recommend you share sides- I went with friends and we shared multiple sides of tater tots, onion rings (more like onion strings) and sweet potato tots to go with our burgers."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and we loved our server Alexandria H. Our 6-year-old daughter ordered at Root Beer Float and she entertained her by asking for her ID. My daughter that she was so cool!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try after waiting forever to open. We were told an hour wait (there were several open tables) but could sit at the bar. Ordered a Mud Pie adult shake, they were out of ice cream behind the bar. She went to get it and made a s'more adult shake instead. After going to get ice cream again, She instantly remade me the correct drink. They did remove it from my check which was nice but I would have gladly paid the $15 had it not taken over 15 minutes for the drink to be the one I ordered. The food was good but both of our burgers were asked to be modified (no jalapeño and no squash) and they were not correct. 
All in all I would try it again but maybe in a few months once they get their system down."}
{"text":"Great Burgers!  Great addition to Cleveland! Darrin our server was awesome! We will be back with the whole family!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and awesome Bar!!
Even though it was the first day that they open, They were so organized and on top of things that we thought they been open for a while."}
{"text":"i always frequent Wahlburgers when I am in the area and the food is great. Whenever I am dined on, the service is great as well. I had recently tried the self serve option, which is a nice touch for on the go/in a rush clients. The bar was spacious and welcoming. The atmosphere wasn't the best (a lot of really loud laughter coming from kitchen staff) but the food again was great. I had the 'Melt', which was a great twist of grilled cheese and a burger and their yummy yukon fries. There food is great and filling but the atmosphere can be improved on. I think there is a reason that many reviewers have given them 4 stars. There is always room for improvment."}
{"text":"This is an airport location, so keep that in mind.

Very expensive for a mediocre burger. I was not impressed with the special sauce. The double burger was a bit too big, even for this yelper's gaping maw. It's always a red flag when burgers are super big: it makes me think they are trying to compensate for a lack of quality meat and/or freshness.

The ice cream or milkshake (I forget which) was not very good, definitely not worth the price. It tasted a bit watered down or airy. It wasn't thick or very flavorful.

However, if you're waiting for a flight in this part of the terminal, it's a pretty comfortable, convenient spot."}
{"text":"I know it's the Vegas strip but it's very pricy for an OK burger. The add ons are cheap. Example, fried egg or bacon, 1.00 each. I guess I just expected better for the hype. I will say, the bun is excellent. Sodas at first threw me off at 4.95 each but comes with a souvenir cup. Also, they have employees who take your picture for free on a postcard but they try to sell you a picture package. I'm just there to eat."}
{"text":"A must do in Vegas, friendly folks working here and great food!!!!! Looking forward to a return trip, everyone should try Alma's Mac salad, crazy good!!!"}
{"text":"I'll admit - I bypassed the hour long wait to get into Wahlburgers and I went upstairs to Redneck Riviera (no wait) and ordered my Wahlburgers food up there (they serve the same food upstairs).  So this review will be solely for the food, not the overall atmosphere.  I would give 4.5 stars if I could because I ordered tater tots and they were rather greasy.  The burger though?  Was totally legit.  I enjoyed every single bite.  The house made pickles were SO good.  I would not wait an hour for a burger, but I've been wanting to try one of these burgers every time I've gone to Vegas since they opened.  Super thankful they serve them upstairs and I was able to get the burger without the wait.  I know that's kind of cheating but hey, what can you do?  Would definitely come again.  Maybe do an early lunch before the crowds show up!"}
{"text":"couldn't wait to eat here but was disappointed with the service! food was good but drinks were alittle pricey.  I live in vegas and used to paying higher prices but the service at the bar was so horrible, that i felt they should be paying me to eat here"}
{"text":"The food was great. Food was out quickly. It wasn't very busy midweek. I will say hire people who want to work. We sat at the bar near the open area and the waitress was complaining about her life where we could hear her. And she never smiled. Sadly, I declined tipping her. Luckily, the food is worth coming back for. Mmm"}
{"text":"Slow service in my opinion but its of coarse because there were so many people. Food in my opinion was over priced but its mostly because of the location which most restaurants in vegas always going to be over-priced but in my opinion for burgers Id rather spend $20 and eat at Gordan Ramsey's Burger spot at planet hollywood. Because here I spent $13 for the burger, $6-7 for the chilli cheese tots and another $3-4 for a drink which total cost over $20 including tip for a meal here."}
{"text":"The burgers are good, the service was great, our waiter Anthony was very attentive, friendly, and polite, funny as well. Bathrooms were pretty clean, we went right before the start of a Cavs playoff game so I am sure the restaurant was extremely busy with patrons otherwise I'm sure the bathroom would have been much cleaner. We will be back for sure. Much more on the menu that we can't wait to try."}
{"text":"I had never had a Wahlburger before so I decided to just go with a plain ol' cheeseburger with nothing else on it but burger and cheese. The taste was amazing and the buttery bun?! YUM! I'm sold on these burgers. The price is right too!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to receive an opportunity to dine at Wahlburgers. First of all, it's a little hidden place on the strip of Las Vegas. We finally found the place, were seated immediately. The waiter was prompt, greeted us with a smile, provided drinks quickly, and our order was filled quickly as well. A 108 degree weather day outside, our drinks were replenished several times during the visit, and we received bright green to go cups. I was disappointed in the \"famous\" mac n cheese with smoke bacon dish. I'm not sure if Alma makes her dish of mac n cheese with watery sauce, but this was too watery. It was more of a watered pasta they forgot to drain, added a little cheese to it and 4 kibbles of bacon top. Not worth the extra effort to find this location. I loved the staff, the interior, and the opportunity. I tipped our waiter well before leaving because of his extra efforts. I'll still watch the show. I don't think Paul would of been pleased or Alma his Mom with the pasta BUT the rest of the visit was nice. Thank you Wahlburgs"}
{"text":"Very little good to say about this place.  So loud, you can't hear across the table. The service was extremely slow and I think he called us \"boss\" at least 45 times. Burgers were wrong, had to ask multiple times for sides. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here to eat as I walked the strip after work. I teach here and forgot the strip prices were HORRID. Asked the hostess if they had high protein options and was assured I could order what I wanted without the bun. I ordered a chicken breast and a turkey burger patty. Both were good, but the chicken was FIRE!!! Moist and portioned at abt 4-5 oz. Glad I was able to enjoy eating out without feeling left out. Its busy on a Thursday but we goy seated immediately inside. Verdict? Coming back, if not for the Donnie posters alone."}
{"text":"I have to do this review based on my experience and less so on the experience of those I went with. We came here before a Blue Jays game, the place was packed and loud but they do have a good system for alerting you via text when your table is available. We waited about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. It took quite a while before anyone came to take our order but it was busy so it is understandable. There are two levels, what appeared to be a takeout counter and TV screens, good for sports fans. 
The reason why I will not be coming back here and why I cannot give them anything more then a 'meh' 2 rating is because they claim to have something for everyone, but I ended up having to eat an order of sweet potato tots as a dinner. Their 'veggie burger' option was a mushroom which had more mushrooms on it as a topping, please note Wahlburgers, not every vegetarian likes or wants to eat mushrooms with more mushrooms. The salads were super limited and the caesar had anchovies in it so I couldn't have that. 
They seriously need to rethink their veggie friendly options, because they're awful. I've been to lots of burger joints and wing places heck steak houses even have better options for vegetarians then this. Vegan's forget it, not happening for your here at all."}
{"text":"Food was awful.. sent our burgers back cause they were ice cold.. the burgers we got back were just as cold.. our server couldn't get any of our checks correct.. terrible food and terrible service.. never eating here again. Very sad"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I had some pretty high expectations for this restaurant that were not fulfilled. My mom and I arrived around 3:50 this afternoon and there was a 5 minute wait (which wasn't bad). They do not have their no wait app set up yet so you can put your place in line before arriving. While we were standing there we noticed it was getting pretty busy and people's wait times went up to 45 minutes. Everyone seems pretty hyped up to try this place. We were seated in a booth and greeted by our waitress Chloe fairly quick. She was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She was also very good with making recommendations which I always enjoy when I go out to a new restaurant. I'm going to be honest, the employees and friendly service is all this place has going for it in my opinion. Kind, friendly service that makes you feel welcomed goes a long way in the food industry. She was very attentive and deserves to be recognized for that. 

The burgers though, they didn't win me over. In fact, they left me wanting to hurl over instead. I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and it was greasy. It comes with 1/3 lb burger, jalapeño, white cheddar, bacon, House made bbq sauce and avocado spread. I asked that they didn't include the jalapeño on my burger, but they also left off the avocado spread sadly. The bbq sauce was pretty good, but the burger itself was too greasy and not very thick. I have definitely had better burgers elsewhere. I hate to say it but it's almost like having a burger at a place like Steak 'n Shake. The tater tots were pretty subpar. Unfortunately, I wouldn't come running back here if I was in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"So disappointing. The food was not good & the wait was long and the service was terrible. They really don't want you to sit out in front where their tables are. But we were able to talk them into giving us to go bags that don't even have any W's on them for wall burgers. Definitely not kid friendly so don't plan to bring your family & Bring lots of money it was quite expensive for some hamburgers"}
{"text":"Located in Bally's.

Opened early until early AM.  It is definitely a popular place because of their famous owners & their television show so expect a wait unless you can find seats at their bar!  Customer service was fantastic!

The Our Burger [Paul's Fave]:  Yum, yum, yum!  The meat was cooked great & Paul's signature wahl sauce was amazing (tastes similar to In-N-Out's Spread), make sure to ask for more! 
BBQ Bacon [Donnie's Fave]:  Great!
Tater Tots (+ cheese for extra $$$):  Cheese similar to Cheez Whiz.  Tater Tots are crispy.
S'mores (Adult Frappe):  So good!  Very filling & they were generous with the alcohol.
Fluffanuttahh (Adult Frappe):  Oh man, Elvis would have loved this shake!  So creamy!"}
{"text":"Just grabbed take out because my boyfriend was craving burgers.. we'd never been to Walburgers before, so we thought we'd give it a shot. 
We were severely disappointed. I ordered the \"our\" burger and it was overcooked to the point it was dry as dust. I'm usually pretty easy to please when it comes to dining out.. but this was exceptionally bad. 
My boyfriend's burger was slightly more edible. He had the BBQ burger. He also ordered a side of Mac and cheese that resembled soup with bread crumbs and bacon on top. 
Our food was clearly reheated and not made to order, as the cooks in the back seemed more interested in socializing and watching whatever was on TV than cooking. 

Really really disappointed."}
{"text":"Sceptical at first but the first bite of the bbq burger has completely won me over.  A burger topped with white cheddar, bacon, avocado and fresh jalapenos.  A little spicy but packed with flavor.  The bun is the right size and the slightly hard crust is prefectly made to hold the burger and contents in place while eating.

Usually,  airport restaurants are never as good as their brick and mortar namesakes but I have quickly forgoten that I was in an airport.  Yes,  The burger/food is that good. The only odd thing is why does everyone have luggage in this phenomenal fine burger  establishment.  

Count me in as a regular. It is now mandatory that I visit Wahlburgers with every trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great, environment was great. I highly recommend the Strawberry Mule....refreshing and delicious!  I was however, disappointed that most of the souvenirs were not in stock. I drove a long way to get there to experience the restaurant and all I left with was a few branded napkins, a basket wrapper and pictures!  Please keep your souvenirs in stock for us that love the show and the family!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service at the takeout window.  This is an airport folks...try to step it up a bit.  The ice cream was freezer burned."}
{"text":"The regular burger was nice but the clubhouse  was REALLY  good.  Juicy,  flavorful.  The fries were also good.  Service was prompt and efficient  but not overly warm.  It beats Tim  Hortons  any time!"}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give no stars I would. This place has the worst processes when it comes to ordering food, if you choose to sit outside. The burger was greasy and the tots cold.  The body guard (aka..employee) was telling people they could not come in until they know what they want to order, which made no sense to me, but hey what do I know about running a subpar burger joint.  

MW I would either change your process or get out and stick to what your do best making great movies!"}
{"text":"So we decided to try a place for burgers we had never been to. This sounded good as they have gluten free buns and from what I read, Bobby Flay's place didn't. When we got there, I noticed the floors weren't clean and I felt like my mom when I saw that!!!! They want to get you in and out quickly but I wasn't ready to order yet. I ended up with their famous 1/3 lb burger on a gluten free bun. My bun was too thick and maybe they are afraid of cross contamination but it wasn't toasted or grilled which may have made it better. They have it down to a science because when I told the waiter I forgot to order to order cooked onions, the burgers were being set down on the table. He did bring the onions on the side. They make their own pickles which are quite mellow. I don't know how they do it but the burgers come really fast. Maybe they have the buns ready to go but we were so surprised. We wonder if the burgers are partially cooked but they use fresh meat and you can have it cooked your way! The meat was very good. My husband ordered sweet tater tots and they were too squishy to me. We ate at The Habit a couple of days before. I ordered a Char combo with cheese and Chris was going to do Chicken but tried the Burger Santa Barbara style which is on grilled sourdough and has grilled avocado and he had a drink. We shared my fries and the bill was under $18. At Wahlburgers everything is ala carte. The drinks are $4.95....not for a shake but a regular fountain drink but you get to keep the glass!!!! The bill came to $43.10 . Too much to me..I didn't need the cup!!!  Chris said his bun was good but I'd rather go to the Habit! We can't compare it to The Burger Bar as we had Foie Gras burgers the time we ate there and though we had a bad waitress, the food was great and the manager sent
 us a dessert when we said the waitress never came back and didn't have anyone else cover our table. Gordon Ramsey's didn't have gluten free buns and that would have been better but the truffle parm fries were incredible..we tried them last visit. They have Shake Shacks and Steak and Shakes. I overheard a man tell the valet where we were staying that Shake Shack was greasy and back to In & Out for him!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  Burgers very small.  Onion rings are onion straws.  Thanks to the bartender working all the way down that kept noticing we needed something.  The two bartenders servicing us was to busy talking to the waiter and waitress.   A shame looked like a fun place to go."}
{"text":"Pros:
 Decent burger
Good fry portion
Lots of seating


Cons:
 Burger was pretty small
Fries were below average
Not worth the price at all.
Sitting in the quick eat section tip is added to bill.

Cost me $22 for a double stack burger, fries and coke."}
{"text":"Not what I thought.  Watched all the episodes. I was expecting awesome burgers. But nothing special. Took forever to get food.  Even manager had to come over and offer a discount. Staff were very nice tho."}
{"text":"I just wanna cry...... Had my hopes so high for the famous burgers that are seen on the show..... Wahhhhhh.  Let a little bit out there.... Wahhhhhh again.  So I am thinking that quality control was left in Boston... Paul Paul Paul.  They did you wrong here in Vegas.... Wahhhhh.  Wahhhhh  Wahhhhh   So i had to even wait to be seated for this... Wahhhhh.  Wahhhh Wahhhhh.    Famous Vegas service... Missed on that one too... Food wrong temp wrong taste... I had a nice cold water though..... Wahhhh  Wahhhhh Wahhhhh............Update stopped and got pizza"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went for a late dinner along the strip and wahlburger. The place is nice and the staffs on duty were attentive and gave customer service in general.
We ordered portabello mushroom sandwich and  \"the our burger\" when we visited the place. But when the order came, we found the food is no longer as hot or should we say freshly prepared. I think the burger should improve its taste and that would be good."}
{"text":"This was a fair burger joint, but very expensive, I guess because of the TV show. Above average burger with bun, extra cheese was great and the bacon was pretty good... But no avocado :-(... Just avocado sauce. We got the tater tots which I was very excited about and they were pretty tasty overall, but I also ordered the macaroni and cheese, which was in a word... Terrible.  Honestly, I think boxed macaroni and cheese has more flavor.  I think they used cheese sauce, instead of cheese, and it had absolutely no flavor - at all, whatsoever.  The only thing that gave it any flavor at all were the breadcrumbs - But even then, not much. I left half of it, and I love macaroni and cheese.  Made me very sad.  And it was almost 8 dollars for the side order. Ouch. If mac & cheese is not important to you, this might be a good place for you to go LOL"}
{"text":"The melt is to DIE for heeeeeeeelllaaaa good! The our burgers are super delicious too!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it so much we ate here twice.  Service was friendly and prompt, and food was delicious.  Awesome that they give you the option to substitute with turkey burgers as it is a great option for people who don't eat red meat.  Lots of other burger joints don't give you this ability, believe it or not.  The onion rings were light and delicious, and the wahl sauce was yummy.  I just wish one would open up in New Jersey."}
{"text":"We live in AZ and we are visiting Cleveland. Since Arizona doesn't have one yet, we decided to try this one. I was a little surprised when we walked in that the floors were really sticky. And you can see the dirt on the floors. We were shown to our table and wanted to look over the menu for a few minutes. A very nice waiter Josh J came and asked what we wanted to drink. He gave us plenty of time. Meanwhile, there was an employee standing around doing nothing but staring at us. 

I ordered the OFD burger and it has Swiss, mushrooms and a relish. I asked for silverware so I can cut it in half. They gave us flimsy plastic silverware. I couldn't believe I couldn't get a REAL knife. As soon as I picked up half my burger and took a bite, everything fell off the bun. I was surprised because I watch the show and Paul always prided himself on their \"homemade\" buns. These were far from homemade. They were wrinkly and soggy. I would say store bought. We ordered French fries and tots. Fries were nothing special and the tots were made from frozen this wasn't even the worst problem. 
 
I had to use the ladies room. I should have held it. The ONLY handicap stall was out of order. The one I used (2 stalls left), like I said I should have held it, was so dirty. The floors in the bathroom were also very sticky, I don't want to know with what but I went into the stall and there was no purse hook, no door handle to lock it (it was broken and just the  inside of the lock was there) and just filth and toilet paper. The soap looked like it was broken too. 

I was looking forward to going for a long time but I will never go back. Not sure I will even watch the show again because I feel it is all a farce. I think they need to inspect their stores before opening any others. I don't see why customers like myself don't deserve a clean eating experience but you can bet if any of the Wahlburg's were going to be there, it would be spic and span."}
{"text":"Service was awesome food was delicious great burger place love the cups the burger was cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out after hearing good reviews. I'll say the food was really good. I ordered a turkey fiesta burger w/fries and my wife ordered the Turkey \"Our Burger\" which comes with special Wahl sauce. She really liked the Wahl sauce but they didn't put much on it so we had to ask for an additional side of sauce. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the poor service. We weren't really sure who our server was, although we sat at the bar, one guy took our order then this other person would pop up every once in a while to see how we were doing. When we needed something, it was hard to get their attention. The staff was little overwhelmed or not on one accord to serve the customers. Hey at least the food was good."}
{"text":"Ok, not impressed. This is not a gourmet burger like Gordon Ramsey's BURGR, it is a dressed up McDonald's. If I want a fast food burger in Vegas, Fat Burger is king."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! 

Terrible service. Took us an hour to get seated and another 20 mins for them to take our order once seated. Ended up being there for over 2 hours when just ordering a grilled cheese and a burger. The grilled cheese wasn't even grilled or melted at all!! Just two slices of cold cheese on a cold bun. Plus French fries instead of the tater tots we ordered. Couldn't believe it. Then when telling the server, she rolled her eyes and just said \"ok\". No \"sorry about that\" or anything. Took another 20 minutes for her grilled cheese to come back and didn't even come back with tater tots. What an awful experience and complete waste of our day in Vegas. 

Food once finally received = D+"}
{"text":"Love the family but wasn't sure how good it would really be ?! It was Sooo good I had the melt, came here with four other couples and everyone loved their meals!!! Even brought back for my in laws ! Very impressed and our server was awesome !!"}
{"text":"I probably should've researched on what to order here but the hot dogs weren't tasty at all and the fries were so soggy :( I was hoping to have a better experience..."}
{"text":"You def aren't getting what they represent on the show!  The burger wasn't terrible. So that's why I give it the 2 stars. The onion rings are a joke!  The atmosphere is very lack luster. Kinda dirty. Staff wasn't over the top friendly either."}
{"text":"I had the Thanksgiving Burger and the Sweet potato tots! Also tried the Mac n cheese w bacon and the sloppy joe! The food is great, and the price is awesome! Good burgers, good atmosphere! Sat at the bar and had space to eat and enjoy! I recommend everyone try this place and definitely try the Thanksgiving burger and sweet potato tots!"}
{"text":"This place was busy for lunch when I visited. Since I was by myself I just sat at the bar. The burger was very tasty despite the fact that I ordered my burger with no cheese and it came with cheese. One thing I didn't like was that the fries which didnt come with the burger, cost $5. They sure didnt taste all that great for  price."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for the first time and it was so good! We had the \"our burger\" and it was so delish! Our server was so nice and patient as well. If you want a good burger that doesn't cost $20 go to this place!"}
{"text":"Great service! The server accidentally ordered us a single instead of a double and was really quick to try to fix it. We weren't mad so we didn't make them fix it. The server felt so bad he gave us a free milkshake. The food was delicious and not a long wait."}
{"text":"We had the best time @ Wahlburgers! Service and food is AMAZING. There was a line when we arrived but we were seated immediately outside and then moved inside once a table opened up. Our server was great, felt like he was family from Jersey. We were continually asked if were we doing ok and at one point a server saw the fries we ordered, but hadn't touched yet were cold so she brought us fresh fries. Again, AMAZING SERVICE. Will definitely be back. 
Good job WahlBrothers!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go. We sat at the bar and our bartender, Courtney, was terrific. She was friendly and attentive and she made some delicious recommendations. We loved the mac and cheese and the burgers. Great service with an awesome smile. We'll definitely be back and will make it a point to do so when Courtney is working."}
{"text":"First time to visit a Wahlburgers.  Overall, not real impressed but I may try one more time to confirm.
Sat at a table, someone came around and offered to take a free pic.  Came back later as dinner delivered with a free \"postcard\" style photo, Anne 2 others you can buy.  Very interesting touch for more of a fast food style place.  Thumbs up on that concept.
Husband ordered \"the one\" burger and said it was good.  I ordered the Mac n Cheese with bacon, made with \"government cheese\".   Very tasty, very government cheesy taste.  Not very hot.
Also ordered their onion rings.  Almost paper thin slices of purple onion appeared to be dredged in a tempura type batter.  Good tasting, husband loved them.  Rings were definitely almost cold when they arrived.
Check it out, interesting place, won't be on my list to return to in any immediate time, but I'll give it one more chance."}
{"text":"I love watching their show and a huge fan of Donny and Mark. I dragged my husband and son to this place because I really wanted to see how good their food was. After 70 dollars spent on 3 burgers, one soda, one tater tots and one Mac and cheese, we were not impressed. Their food was nothing special. I would rather go to In n out or five guys. 70 dollars for this??? My husband's favorite food is cheeseburger and he said he would not come here again. I will pay more for better food but this place.... 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food was great. I was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype, but it did. I had the signature burger with a side of onion rings. The flavors all melded together wonderfully. Everything on the burger served a purpose. You are not getting your typical thick onions when you order the onion rings. They are very thin stringing onions but again lots of flavor. We parked across the street at the flamingo(free parking) and just walked across the street. You can't actually see the restaurant from Las Vegas Blvd but it was hard to spot once you are in the area. The service was quick and friendly. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I really didn't know what to expect...normally these kind of places that have a celebrity's name attached to it is merely a cash grab....not at Wahlburgers! The burger is literally one of the best I've ever had. Ingredients were fresh and the burger was hearty and very tasty. The fries that I ordered were fresh ,crispy and delicious.
The establishment was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Disappointing is how I describe this place in one word.  I truly hope that the quality and value of the food for this establishment is only due to its placement in an airport rather than being a true representation of Wahlburgers.  I got the \"Our Burger\" which claims to be 1/4 lb.  if this is indeed true, then this burger went through an incredible shrinking ray because it looked more like a slider sized patty.   Aside from the size, it was cooked very well-done and had absolutely no seasoning.  Bland behind bland which needed to be seriously rescued by some form of condiment.  The sauce was pretty good although there just was not enough to save my mouth of the dry desert-like experience of swallowing that burger.   For the price of this tiny offering, I would expect some fries included, but of course that was not the case.  On the positive,  the chain offers lots of variations and choices.  Also, the bun and vegetables were fresh and quality, but if you are a burger place and cannot get the patty right, who gives a Shhh."}
{"text":"We ordered burgers, tots and crispy onion fries. Burger bread was cold, like straight from the refrigerator cold. Tots are not homemade or anything, just your standard tater tots from Cisco or whatever. The entire thing needs seasoning, any seasoning at all- salt, pepper, something! Name drew us in, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Such a tasty Thanksgiving Burger!!  However we were waiting for over an hour, the music is too loud, the staff are snotty and the looping videos of the Wahlberg boys yukking it up is lame to the point of nausea."}
{"text":"Was attracted to the Wahlburgers sign on the outside of Bally's, like a fly is attracted to a blue light.  I heard about this place through the Wahlburgers show.

Got the standard \"our burger.\"  Pretty tasty, but be sure to ask for extra Wahl sauce (extra creamy Thousand Island).  

To-go order took about 10 minutes to make, with only one person's order ahead of me.  Open late, this place is a savior if you're in the mood for a late-night burger on the center strip.  Prices are high, ($10-13).  But that's what you get for eating in this area.

Friendly staff, clean facilities.  I'll be sure to visit Wahlburgers again if I run into them at another location."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!  The food was just ok and the price was HIGH!!!!  A burger for $11-13 and then you have to pay $5 for a small portion of cheap fries or tater tots. No good and not worth it."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but the burger patty was more like a child's portion. Food was better than the service..this is more like what it really is..just an airport bar serving cheap food with unskilled labor. Save your money."}
{"text":"Nothing special.   Very greasy.  Left the place and had to change and shower to get rid of the greasy smell."}
{"text":"Wait was not long, service wasn't bad. However I did have to send back my burger (double decker) three times before I simply wanted a refund. The first time was because I ordered my burger with no onions and no pickles, and they put onions on it. Second time was when they brought it and it was almost ice cold (they probably left it next to a fridge?) girl was super nice & understanding so she sent it back again. And third was when it made me sick. The double decker has two meat patties and one of them was cooked the other was completely RAW. You can see for yourself in the pictures. Manager or whoever was super nice. Took my burger out of the check and gave us a discount on our whole ticket as well as offered free dessert. The rating is for the food. Before you take a bite, check your burger."}
{"text":"So yummy! The burgers were juicy and full of flavor. My 14 year old was raving over the Our burger  The crispy haddock was just wonderful. Onion rings were amazing!  Love the Wahl Sauce. So worth the wait! Our server was lovely also! Great experience."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the first time and unfortunately the last!!!  Was hoping to like it but everything was disappointing!  I see everyone on here complaining about the sides and I have to agree!!  We ordered a side of French fries (3.50) and they were awful!!  And you get about a handful if that in a paper cup!!  The drinks were all mixers with an added taste of chipotle on the rim (absolutely disgusting ).  The burger was average!!  Red robin has better burgers and unlimited fries wish they would put one in the north hills!!!  Overall too expensive!!  And not at all the quality you would expect from the Wahlburgs they should stick to making movies not burgers!!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this celebrity turn fast food joint  i gave it 3 stars only because the fries and tater tots were delivered barely warm. Why oh why can't restaurateurs cook fries to order. Soggy limp fries just taste like crap.  My burger was delicious and had it not been for the fries, i would have given them 4 stars. I'd try it again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that there was a Walburgers in Vegas but let me tell you  it was one of the worst hamburgers I ever eat. It was cold from sitting on the counter for 10 minutes, the fries were ice cold they were already sitting on the counter when I ordered a long with at least 10 orders. Since I paid over 20 dollars for a hamburger, fries and coke I was expecting it to be hot and fresh. 

Would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I have heard of Wahlburgers from my friends that live in Boston. I am excited to finally have tried and it and it was as good as I expected it. The bun was soft and sweet with a buttery and crisp taste. The burger was fresh and cooked to exactly how I requested it, medium-well. The food came out fat. It isn't a walk up and order restaurant. You do have to sit down and order but you probably can call it in. It was pretty packed and the burger is about the $10-15 range and fries or tots are an extra $4. It can be a bit pricey for what you get but I guess for Vegas anyways this is normal pricing. My husband and I thought the service was fast and friendly and they definitely tended to us.  Whenever we do come back to Vegas, we will definitely come visit Wahlburgers again."}
{"text":"First off
Vegetarian yelping friends
They have the impossible burger!
I was in the mood for a hearty burger often a challenge for a vegetarian I had heard seen the sign for Wahlburgers on McKnight saw such mixed yelp reviews but figured might as well give it a try. 
It's in a mall
The mall was closed I almost left there were no cars in the lot..but looking up I see Wahlburgers all lit up and their outside porch TVs were on
So I head in take the elevator up...and there is Wahlburgers 
Warmly greeted I sit in a booth
Instantly my friendly waitress is there to help me
I explain I'm here for that impossible burger she assures me I will love it
As I'm waiting I'm brought a yum little cup cake with green sprinkles
Then some sweet potato tots omg are they yum
They taste sort of maplely. 
Waitress made me a cherry coke float a perfect side to my burger 
And let me tell you about my burger I tweaked it's original menu suggestion 
So mine has American cheese lettuce tomato and their burger sauce
The burger was So good 
The atmosphere is casual there was a tv showing Wahlburger info it's cute
And there was a tv with Baseball on
All the chairs are green so maybe Donnie's fav color is green?
Great service yum food this burger place is an easy five stars. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled in here one afternoon after a long night of drinking. At first I was overwhelmed by the menu because it all sounded amazing! The atmosphere was fun, the music was a tat loud for us but that's probably because we were hung over. Everyone looked as if they were enjoying themselves, and our waiter was extremely friendly and informative. 

I decided on the Melt but requested the potato bun rather than the thick-cut bread. I also was intrigued by the mac and cheese when I noticed it included the word bacon, so I had to order that too. I also really wanted to try the sweet potato tots and luckily my friend decided to order those. 

The burger was delicious. The crispy bacon, caramelized onions, and yummy house pickles made it perfect in my opinion. The mac and cheese was appetizing, not the best I've had, I wish it included a little more bacon, but overall it was good. But out of everything the thing that I loved the most is the ONE sweet potato tot my friend allowed me to try. It was this perfect consistency of crispy on the outside but soft and sweet on the inside. It was just perfect. Please whatever you do, make sure you try those! They're heavenly."}
{"text":"We were super excited to visit Wahlburgers, as we are big fans of the show, the brothers & of course Mama Alma, the true star!! This place had an outdoor patio but F that in the hot Vegas sun, no way! Maybe for the regulars but not for this Cali Girl. As you walk in low & behold a cut out full size Marky Mark poster. Great photo op for customers but WTH no Alma?? It was busy & hot, so naturally I ordered the spiked lemonade. I had a regular cheeseburger done medium, crispy onions, & tots. The patty is thick and somewhat juicy but not juicy juicy like I like them. Bread was fresh as were the lettuce, tomato, and secret W sauce. Overall burger was good. My nephew ordered a sloppy joe so of course I tried it & it was somewhat dry. It has piled high with crispy onions but had little meat. My nephew didn't even make a sloppy mess like he usually does. Up the meat & sloppy sauce Paul! Tots were crunchy and hot but the container was not full so either use smaller containers or up the tots. My alcoholic drink was never brought out to me just the water I ordered. I informed the waiter who notified the manager I think her name was Yadiria (misspelled) she handled the situation professionally. If I had to choose I would much rather have Shake Shack, sorry fam. But def better than In N Out!  #sorrynotsorry XOXXO"}
{"text":"For the excitement we all had coming to eat here, even after a 30 minute wait, what a disappointment! The service has been atrocious. Half of the orders were wrong. We've been here for over a half hour without drinks. We have all finished eating or refused to eat anything else and one of the people at my table still hasn't received his food. Come to find out, it's because they cancelled his order. No idea why. My Bbq burger sadly didn't have any BBQ sauce on it - womp womp! They took a photo of the table and said they would give us a complimentary postcard...but they put us separately on the postcard instead of the group. WTF?! No thanks. Part of our order was comped, but the manager handled the issues extremely poorly. The onion straws are yummy - eat them if you still choose to go. Water comes in a to go cup, which I love. These reasons, and the fact that my order was actually correct are the reason there are two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Uncooked chicken sandwich. We ate half and asked for something else. They gave us fries but still charged for the sandwich. Service had an horrible attitude."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable. So I get the double Decker burger $13, Tater tots which were like warm and I asked the waitress to get me some new ones they came back just a little warmer. Tater Tots $5, a fountain drink which was a 12 ounce cup was $4 and a milkshake $8. Total $30. This place is way over priced. I will never go back. It's not worth it. This place should be embarrassed for what they charge. I can get a way better burger in Vegas called The Habit burger grill."}
{"text":"So so disappointed, love the show and have been looking so forward to trying a burger that looks so good on TV. We had an opportunity while in Vegas, maybe we should have waited until we could get to Boston??? Not sure, but what we got in Vegas was an overpriced double cheeseburger and cold tater tots- for what we spent we could have got at McDonald's much faster, and 1/3 of the price- with a shake.  Saving grace,  Staff was friendly, other than that save your money and your expectations for hopefully a better burger in Boston - We will try again if our disappointment can fade and our broken hearts and taste buds heal from our let down experience."}
{"text":"not that bad. went around 430 on wed during sema and had good service and food was good. burger was good. the mac was a fair amount for the 7.95 waiter was good. looking forward to lunch tomorrow for the beast burger.."}
{"text":"Solid burgers right on the strip.  Price isn't too bad and the service is good.  The onion rings were interesting.  Cut very thin with light batter.  Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Was totally excited to try this place and brought my Boyfriend, my Dad and  Boyfriend's Mom. Once we finally received our food we found out it really wasn't worth the wait or the hype. Disappointed. Very small and loud atmosphere. Fries were good, the ones that weren't burnt and so were the pickles but the burger wasn't as fantastic as all the hype you hear about."}
{"text":"Meh. Not bad, not great...just average. Nothing memorable about the food or the service except it was nice they had tater tots as a side option instead of just regular 'ol fries. I don't plan on going back unless someone else insists."}
{"text":"This place is indeed Mark Wahlberg themed. His pictures and quotes cover the walls. 

Wahlburgers seating is divided into 2 sections, full service (at the front) and self service (at the back). I was initially pretty confused at the choice. Why would someone choose self serve if you can be served by someone else? Ended up realized that the difference is savings in not having to tip.

On to the food! 

The eh?!? burger was alright. It had peameal bacon, a nice juicy beef patty, and a runny egg. It was gigantic and tasted great but granted runny eggs is probably not the best idea in a burger. The meal got real messy real quick. 

Fries were meh, overly salty for my taste

Would not recommend the banana fluffanutta dessert. It can be easily made at home in under 5 mins with bread, pb, Nutella and bananas. Not worth the $5.

All in all, mediocre food in a Wahlberg centric environment. Personally not a huge fan of Mark so I didn't appreciate as much."}
{"text":"Well I've been to Shake Shack a few times and have been to InNOut in Cali. Texas and Vegas dozens of times. Wahlburgers was next on my cheese burger bucket list.  I tried the double meat double cheese and asked them to give me half potato and half sweet potato tater tots. With an $18.00 price tag it's up there with Shake Shack. InNOut is half that. I liked the juicy burger and the regular potato tater tots. The sweet potato tots weren't as crunchy. 

I'd put Wahlburgers at a dead tie with Shack Shack. InNOut is still number one at half the price."}
{"text":"Knew what to expect coming here. People say high prices and service fees. But they told us the 18% is waived now. They heard the reviews!

The Our Burger, Paul's choice!. It may look small and at 5oz it's not big but I don't think it's small either. A local gourmet burger joint I'd say is what everyoe compares burgers to these days comes out at 4oz so it's bigger than them. Thing is 'gourmet: burgers are tall, not flat. If they were flat, you'd get a bigger bun.

People ask well how does it compare to this 'gourmet' burger? Well I think the bun holds up better. And it's quote tasty so I like it.

The issue here is that Wahlburgers is not sure whether they are gourmet or fast food. Sit down or take out. So I sit down, the service is quite good and attentive. They serve the burgers in a basket which is indicative of takeout I think. So at this price point you don't want to feel like it's takeout. They have tater tots and sweet potato tater tots. I personally like the tater much more than the sweet potato ones. The sweet potato ones are more sweet than expected. Don't forget about the buffalo sauce, it's a great dip.

They seem to have difficulty finding space for a group of 6. Their tables just are not made for this; generally for 2s and 4s. So they could figure that out.

Also, it says it's child friendly and they do have high chairs and booster seats. But no table for changing in the restrooms.

I think if they figure out what they are it'll do fine. It's a bit expensive for fast food, but if they can figure out how to make it not feel fast food then the price point is quite competitive. Burgers do taste good, I like the tater tots. Fries looked good too! And make sure to not retract the waiving of 18% service charge, I want my choice in what tip to give."}
{"text":"First time dining here at wahlburger in LV and my experience is one of the best! Thanks to our wonderful server Alexandria P. For her excellent customer service and professional attitude!. She sets the standard and went above and beyond. Thank you Alexandria!."}
{"text":"Only had time for a drink but the bartender, Talia, was so nice and happy, perfect demeanor for a bartender.  Nice selection of beers, clean, comfortable chairs, this is what we need in more airports!"}
{"text":"Fairly expensive for what you get.  Food was tasty.  Burgers are $10-$14 and fries are not included with adult burgers.  Side of fries are $5 but really only serve one person (compared to other places where the side of fries can easily serve 2-3 people).  Kids' items are $8 but do not include a drink (extra $2)."}
{"text":"We are big fans of the family and watch the show and thought it would be great to try the restaurant. We were not disappointed. We both had the BBQ bacon burger, the avocado spread was the best party!! I loved the sweet potato tots too. Super filling and excellent service. Our food came out immediately, cooked perfectly. We will be back"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and the food was a 10 easy...Folks this establishment is here to stay...And if their not close to ya like 3 hours from us,Get in your buggy and start getting a move...Highly Highly recommend,,,GETCHA SUM!!!"}
{"text":"Some times service and speed of preparation are more important than presentation. Like when your flight leaves in 50 minutes and boarding is in 20. For airport food, it was reasonably priced and the quality was fine.  The Walburg empire delivered! As a side light the shroom burger was not to bad either. Will definitely eat here again at the next opportune time."}
{"text":"Wahlburgers in Pittsburgh (Ross Township) is bad. I don't mean it was just a mediocre experience after a 40 minute drive and 1.5 hour wait. It was seriously bad in contrast to even if it was down the street from home with no wait after all the advertisement, hype, and price. Actually, there are so few positive things to say that I'm going to start with them because one might not make it to the end of the review and I do want to give credit where it's due. 

The good:
1) Kind FOH staff - Everyone came off very friendly. The waitstaff was rightly apologetic when things went wrong and willing to make attempts to satisfy needs. The bar tender provided service to us at the service bar since the bar was full and we were waiting quite a while.
2) The actual flavor of the burger was ok. It doesn't crack the top 5 or even the top 10 in Pittsburgh but I'd eat it again. To be fair I was hungry on my way there and after 1.5 of waiting was starving. I had \"Donnie's Fave\" .. BBQ bacon burger as I do anywhere so I can fairly compare to others as it's a staple meal for me. Don't dream of getting anything as good as Tessaro's, Burgatory, BRGR, or even Primantis. We're talking higher end fast food quality like maybe if Chick Fil A made burgers, which doesn't make sense because they aren't even doing take out at Wahlburgers and there is no drive through. The sweet potato tots were kinda bland but not bad either. It's a far far cry from the \"high quality ingredients\" they boast on the website or all of the hype it has gotten.

The bad:
1) Terrible, and I mean terrible, attention to detail. At 8:30pm on 1/7/18 long after the dinner rush died down the server did not serve our party of 6 with food all at once, nor 2 or 3 or 4 trips. It took 5 trips just to deliver everyone's meals and sides over a span of 15 minutes. The excuse was that my burger was dropped and had to be remade but that didn't excuse the structure of service consisting of 3 other deliveries spaced out over 13 minutes brought out one or two at a time. He and assisting servers failed to return with obvious accessories required with food such as a spoon for chili (4 requests), originally ordered side of ranch (4 requests), silverware (2 requests), and forgotten sides. 

2) What even is this food quality and is this serious?! Chili is legit Wendy's or identical to Wendy's fast food chili and this is no lie 3 times the price that Wendy's is serving it for. The fries and tater tots are exactly what I've been getting at the grocery store on sale 2 for $5 bags of Ore-Ida brand served at room temperature in a smaller portion. The thin crispy onion rings are not rings at all and by thin I think they mean possibly \"the edge of a butter knife\" thin. I expected petite loops of deep fried onion. We got shreds of stuck together onion hairs? Think a generic off-brand version of French's crispy fried onions that your aunt tops her green bean casserole with. Yeah, that was the side of onion rings. The mini penne Mac n cheese is not mini. It was some of the larger penne I've seen and someone literally tossed a handful of shredded cheddar over noodles, microwaved it, then stirred. I kid you not that the 3 year old trying to eat it said \"this is terrible\" unprompted before anyone else did which might have been the best part of my night there. Nothing was served hot or even pretty warm.

3) Priced at about $120+tip for party of 6, two of which were kids and included 4 beers (kids drinks were prepaid while waiting and not included in the meal total). Could have easily gotten better food in a place with similar items for much less. Places I'd rather go: Red Robin, Friday's, Applebee's, all the way down to Wendy's and even Steak N Shake. 
 
Notes: 
Funny that the people who waited after us in line approached our table after their meal to confirm it was the lamest experience ever. Even though we hadn't even finished yet they received the yes nod. You aren't crazy ma'am, this sucks.

There was an NFL playoff game on and we were stuck watching Mark Wahlberg talk (probably good about himself and his family's restaurant) on mute for 20 minutes while a host struggled to change it to something the whole place wanted to watch."}
{"text":"Came on NYE around 8:30pm. Originally put our name on the list, but found that we could seat ourselves at the bar area if there were any open spaces.

We had great service from our waitress- but near the end of our meal, she left and was replaced. Did not know where she went, but it looked like the women were all asked to leave the floor for a possible video shoot, since we saw cameras inside. The men who replaced our waitress seem frazzled. Some were on it, and others were hurried.

In terms of the food, I had the seasonal offering and it wasn't bad- I had to add lettuce and I would've opt'd for a lettuce bun. They have artisinal buns, but it didn't stand out to me (but it wasn't terrible by any means). Had a side of hash to share- fresh, but nothing special either.

I would come back to try another burger, but it is on the pricey side and didn't stand out greatly. I prefer Shake Shack.

The bathroom is located outside of the restaurant, around the corner - casino adjacent."}
{"text":"Came on a birthday getaway treat for my hubby and we got tired of resto gourmet preps. So we opted to try this place eager to know what the Wahlburger is all about... and we were impressed with the food. We got the triple decker 5oz burger and ceasar salad with crispy fish fillet and the taste is spot on.. Simple, honest cooking just like how Mama Wahlburg would feed her kids. No fancy plating, no crazy spices.. just good old burger, salad and crunchy potato fries... Food and taste that sticks to the bone."}
{"text":"When Walhburgers opened in Toronto I simply wanted to try it for the sake of trying it. After all, a burger monster's gotta eat!

I am aware that the burger chain is a venture by movie star Mark Wahlberg and his brothers, and that there is also a reality TV show based around it. Since I generally don't view reality TV, I can care less what it's about; sounds stupid to me anyhow. However it freaked me out when the first sign posted at the entrance is a legal public film/photography waiver notice. That's a first in my eating out experience.

No film crew on my visit. But the second thing I saw entering was a throng of people behaving like tourists, gawking and snapping pictures at every detail of the establishment. Walking out after eating here or entering, it seems like I just stepped into a tourist trap. This is not a celebrity chef's place like Susur Lee (who has a restaurant** on the other side of the Soho Metropolitan Hotel building that also houses Wahlburgers). This is a Hollywood celebrity's restaurant, of course you'll feel like you're in a scene and say you've been here! Roll out the red carpet... and get the fuck outta way; this is a food serving establishment, not a TIFF premiere.

The layout is confusing. The front part is dedicated to full service restaurant operations, including waiter service and yes, alcohol! They sure love for you to sit down here. Further back and a couple turns later is the usual and more empty quick service order counter, plus some casual seating that extends to the upper level mezzanine.

As a warning, the menu for burgers only show the price for their 'regular' size. Something I learned the hard way when I was asked if I want the 5oz or 8oz. 5? Only kids eat the 5oz patty! I want the 8 ouncer! Super size that shit; it's the all-American way, right? Upsell wins, well played.

The \"Our Burger\" 5er is $9.69 on the posted menu, but super sized will run ya $11.65, $13.16 with tax.

And what is this 8oz signature Our Burger? It looked like fast food roadkill to begin with. The 8oz beef patty is an oval shaped elongated thing sandwiched between two microscopic kids meal sized buns, sticking out profoundly like IKEA purchases that could not fit in the car so you drive away with the trunk open. It was pathetically tiny overall, the juices was dripping mad like a horribly leaky faucet, and tasted like a typical fast food chain burger. Nothing special, nothing enjoyable, not impressed. The ingredients were barebones basic--tomatoes, pickles, processed cheese, confetti sized lettuce... if you can belt off the Big Mac song, it pretty much describe what they put in it. It took five minutes to prepare this disappointment for me (whilst waiting for my 4-digit order number to be called--sure felt like Mr. Bean in the waiting room scene, because how many thousand more people could there be before me?), and another five to eat it. A $13 burger should not take me five or less minutes to consume. I felt sorry for the cows who were sacrificed to produce this blasphemous ripoff.

In summary, Wahlboogers is a disappointing, overhyped, and deceptive experience where the star ingredient used is the name itself. Should you go here, do not get the Our Burger, though based on my experience I cannot imagine their other stuff being any more exciting. I felt like I paid for a pack of silver lined underwear for Marky Mark, for it wasn't worth it. With their high prices for small lame products, one could get much better and more enjoyable burgers--be it a fancy gourmet thing or a  greasy thick wonder--elsewhere on the $10-14 range.

{"text":"When eating in Vegas there are so many choices to pick from but you would have to be crazy not to try Marky Mark's restaurant. I was really shocked when the food was actually amazing. 

I also like that you don't just walk in and pick a seat. You have to wait to be seated so you get noticed when you walk in. 

I got the OUR burger and the mac n cheese. Next time I might skip the macaroni but the cheeseburger was absolutely delightful. The burger you could tell was actual not frozen beef burger. Everything about it was delicious. It's pretty expensive and everything is ala carte. You also get a complimentry photo! But, it's pretty small so you do get a choice to buy a bigger picture, which of course I did. 

You should try this place out! It's pretty great."}
{"text":"the burger was fine. Onion rings a bare pass. But there's no chance I'll be back. 
The place was almost empty. I think I know why
 On every wall, the middle screen is an endless loop of Wahlburgs being \"entertaining\". After 20 minutes, I wanted to puke. 
Make the burgers better and cancel the selfindulgent self promotion!"}
{"text":"Ordered Medium burger, got it well done. My husband ordered fries, they charged us for 2 orders ( I don't eat fries ). Soda came with a souvenir cup I did not want and charge. Mr Wahlburg is far better at yelling at robot cars, rapping in his underwear, and running from pollen than he is at running a chain. Stick to what you're good at Mark."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner after hearing a lot of hype. When first arriving I was not getting a good vibe as it seemed very crammed and I got a very corporate chain vibe. I ordered the bbq burger and it was absolutely phenomenal. I just wish it was a little bigger. I also ordered a side of onion strings and Mac & cheese that I split with my coworker. The Mac & cheese seemed a bit runny but tasted fantastic.! The onion strings were good but nothing special, i'd probably opt for a different side next time I come in. Overall this place has phenomenal burgers and I look very forward to trying out their other locations in the near future."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Honestly, the food was pretty good. It's was a lot like a Sonic or Shake Shack. Definitely a fast food burger place.

It was very busy when we went and I'm sure that it's usually like that. What is pretty cool is that you can either sit down and eat or go order yourself and take it out or find a place to sit (I think that's how it works?) The service wasn't the quickest, but everyone was friendly.

The choice of burgers were pretty typical. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger and the BBQ sauce was extremely good. The burger overall was decent. Sweet potatoe totes weren't too bad either.

I have to say that the TVs were extremely annoying. I don't dislike Mark Wahlburg, but every other TV played a reel about the Wahlburg family (basically that means there were some clips to Mark Wahlburg's movies). It started to get very annoying. I would have much rather that the just played his movie or something.

Overall, it was enjoyable, but I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Service needs improvement. My fiancé and I went there last night and our server had no clue what was going on. Saw staff leaning on the counters one playing with her hair where the food goes. Food was mediocre and waited 45 minutes before the food arrived to the table, even then gave us the wrong burgers, and wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"I love this place, I've been here 4 maybe 5 times and have never been disappointed. From their burgers, to their salads, to their sweet potato tots to their fruity Moscow Mules. You can get any burger and/or sandwich turned into a salad, whatever their secret dressing/sauce they have is delish! Their sweet potato tots are my favorite, can't go here without getting those. The atmosphere is awesome, the customer service has always been great and there was only once when they first opened that I had to wait to be seated/helped.

This place is easy to get to if you are staying on the strip or just simply on the strip. I work close to the strip and we decided to choose this place for lunch and it was not easy to get too, definitely was a mission. Safe to say I won't go out of my way again to eat here. If in the area, absolutely! My boyfriend and I stayed an Bally's and ate here several times because it was close and yummy! Prices aren't terrible but anything on the strip is going to be pricier than off the strip."}
{"text":"We showed up in this restaurant at 9:45 PM, although the restaurant was scheduled to close at 10 PM. The hostess/waitress led us to a booth. A couple of other tables of customers were still in the restaurant. We ordered our hamburgers, fries, onion rings, and root beer float. Our food was brought to our table at 9:58 PM. My husband was brought fries rather than onion rings, but we did not mention the mistake to the waitress because it was almost closing time. She was friendly and checked in with us off and on to make sure that we were happy with the food. The burgers seemed to a good quality, and we enjoyed the taste. The fries were fries.

4-28-2018 update: I ate at this restaurant again this week. My husband really likes their hamburgers. He thinks that the hamburgers are the best in Pittsburgh. Today I ordered macaroni salad, which was 5 stars, and a grilled cheese sandwich, which was 4 stars. The waitress did not bring out my macaroni or utensils, so I had to ask for them. She also fumbled with our payment at the end."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with all of the burger options in Vegas, but I personally favor Wahlburgers over any other. 

The taste of the regular burger is very similar to shake shack and in the same price range. It is delicious. But what sells me is the star power of ol' Marky Mark and his bros owning the joint. I think it's cool!

Not to mention both times I have been the service was excellent. 

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to my first experience at Wahlburgers.  I was somewhat disappointed, we ordered the onion rings, which they were out of and never bothered telling us until our orders came out. We also did not receive our homemade pickles with some of our burgers. Utensil we're not supplied, until asked for a few times, also adult sized drinks at adult prices were brought to our table instead of kid drinks, at the kid price. 
Overall would give it 3 stars, really wanted to rate it higher, but was not super excited about the experience..... maybe because it's new, but wouldn't travel over 1 hour again for the same experience."}
{"text":"I went because it was close to my hotel and I was hungry. I got the sangria and sloppy joes. I am a huge fan of sloppy joes and this place did not disappoint. It was served on a piece of toast over flowing with sloppy joes, dripped cheese and French onions, with homemade pickles on the side. Pricey but good. Do it."}
{"text":"We finally got to try Wahlburgers in Las Vegas. The decor and ambience was nice. The service was really good.The burgers are good. The fries and onion rings are ok. If you want a good burger? I would try Wahlburgers."}
{"text":"The burger and tots were good. The burger still doesn't beat In-N-Out, but it is a good burger. Loved the Wahlburger sauce, but the homemade pickles just tasted like a cucumber, not really a pickle. I am not sure how Paul would feel about the service here - it was not that great."}
{"text":"The burger I had as a whole was good except the meat didn't taste like it had had any seasoning added to it. I ordered the side of onion rings and it became obvious that the oil wasn't hot enough, as they had soaked up so much oil I began to feel a little sick at the end of my meal. 
The overall feeling of the restaurant felt ok but the acoustics was a bit too overwhelming.
I would give it another try as I might of gone in on a bad night, but not a great first impression."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Had the fried pickles and sweet potato tots. The bbq bacon cheese burger was delicious and had a kick."}
{"text":"Burgers are kind of small and you have to pay for sides but the worst part is the service. They were not full at all and the bartenders took about 10 minutes to even look at me and the other new customers just sitting down. I wanted to get a water to start and that took forever to flag her down after I got the menu. Once ordering the water, I wanted to order a burger but she turned her back to get the water for me, poured the water in a cup, then proceeded to give another customer his bill. Once he had given her his credit card, she swiped his card and waited for him to sign before turning around and bring me my water. Terrible. I then wanted to order my food but she turned immediately and started helping someone else even though I tried to tell her that I wanted a burger. About 20 minutes after sitting at the bar, I finally had my water but still hadn't ordered my food even though I was ready to order my food about 5 minutes after sitting down. I finally got my order in and waited about 20 minutes to get my burger. Maybe they have one chef in the back to make the burgers but seriously, the restaurant wasn't even full and 20 minutes for a burger is way too long. Especially when it's in the airport and people need to go. I considered just walking out because my flight was going to leave in 20 minutes but at that moment, I saw a waitress finally bringing my burger to my table. 

Burger-wise, it was plain and unsatisfying. Waiting for a 40 minute burger better be worth the wait and this one wasn't. The burger itself was tiny and the meat had very little seasoning. I wanted onion rings but they decided to make onion strings instead. If I had known this, I would have just ordered fries because onion strings aren't good. I think the only reason why this place gets any attention is because it is owned by the famous actors but seriously, this place sucks! I will never come back here again and strongly recommend others avoid this dump."}
{"text":"This was hands down, an amazing experience. The food was phenomenal! We had a party of three and we all got a sandwich and sides and passed everything around the table so we could try a little bit of everything. We didn't have one average dish. They were all top notch! You MUST try the onion rings, as well as the sloppy joe sandwich. As far as drinks are concerned, our server (who was awesome, by the way) recommended the FluffaNuttah and O M G.... Just go to Wahlburgers!!"}
{"text":"For the last couple months I make the trek down to the strip and eat at my favorite burger joint in Las Vegas. Worth the drive to the strip!!!
We tried their Ultimate Bloody Mary with Bacon Salt and meat sticks and it blew us away!! Our favorite is the Donnie but we know everyone loves Mark.. Every time it's just as good as the first. Well done!"}
{"text":"Omg. So good. I love tater tots but I'm picky. These were delicious. I had Paul's choice and added bacon. I can't say enough good about it. I'm glad we have one in LA. I will definitely be visiting it soon."}
{"text":"The burgers where missing ingredients, not sure if they're normally this small but they forgot the avocado. Basically a piece of bacon, small piece of meat and cheese. Don't fall for the pics, extremely over priced and tastes like crap, hopefully it was just the cook but was very disappointed. I really wanted to like this place because he's one of my favorite actors. 

Update they remade the burger and tasted way better!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday night after work. The food was good, we got two different burgers that were both quite good and different from each other, but the drinks were certainly overpriced (though there own brand of beer wasn't bad) and the automatic 18% automatic gratuity was a little annoying. Thankfully our server was nice enough to tell us it was added in already so we didn't tip her twice. If you go, be prepared to spend a little extra than you might be comfortable with for a burger."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Wahlburgers for the longest time and we went  there a few days ago and the food was really good. The service could of been better, but then again we were there close to closing time. Kind of sad one of my cups broke, but that will just give me a reason to go back soon."}
{"text":"For a specialty burger place this one kinda sucks. Overdone patty, lame cheese, pathetic fries (worse than McDonald's!), only decent service for a sit-down place, loud atmosphere. The only reason it wasn't a 1-star is because I only tried one thing and I admit other things might be better! Seems like a popular place so I might be missing something."}
{"text":"Thank goodness he's got a day job.

Nothing special about the burger.  The Mac n cheese was sad.  Some Velveeta looking cheese glob rested on top of a cup of penne that apparently I was supposed to mix myself.  Didn't realize until I ate the top n was left with a quarter cup of plain penne.  Not enough cheese.  Not even close.  

Best part of the meal were fries.

Go to Holstein's for a decent burger."}
{"text":"Visiting family, walking the streets of downtown Cleveland and find Wahlburgers. Such a foodie city and lots of competition for the hungry travelers! Hit it about 1:30 with a large family crowd, only waited about 10 minutes, nice. The Mac & Cheese was excellent, a must do. The burgers, various were ordered, were hot - tasty - large - crazy good. The sides were many, again we ordered and shared and have nothing to say but very good! Service was fast, waitress attentive and helpful. Pretty large restaurant for downtown Cleveland, lots of space but we did come in after the lunch crowd too. The $$ was good for what we ordered in a downtown city locale, kids menu was very reasonable..thank you. While this may be considered a fast food place it's done with a flair and shown a lot of love. We'd definitely do this place again, perhaps next trip...a positive lunch stop!"}
{"text":"Big burger fan and a big marky mark fan so I decided to experience the best of both worlds by trying out Wahlburgers.

The food was as good as mark wahlbergs character in the Four Brothers... which was pretty damn good in my opinion! I ordered the OFD which is a half pound burger with Swiss cheese. I couldn't finish it. I like my burgers with a little blood in them so I got medium rare. Seemed to be cooked to that state!

Located in the Bally's Bazaar Market. Pretty cool area that I don't think as many people know of compared to the LINQ promenade or forum shops.

Service was extremely quick and friendly but it was kind of hard to request for the check because towards the end, they weren't really catching any eye contact or seeing us wave our hands around to catch their attention."}
{"text":"Fun place, great food, reasonably priced and had the best bar back - Ely!  He went out of his way to make us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"I visited Wahlburgers for lunch at around 1pm on Friday, July 15th.  I was alone so was able to immediately find a seat at the bar.  The beer selection at the bar was average and I was happy to see that they had at least one tap from a local brewery.

I ordered the \"Our Burger\" with bacon and jalapenos added with a side of onion rings.  The food was subpar.  The burger came in a fairly reasonable amount of time, but the meat was lukewarm.  The burger was excessively greasy and left large pools of grease on the paper liner of the serving basket.  The flavor of the burger overall was bland.  You should get a much higher quality product at a similar price at one of the many burger bars on the strip.

The onion rings were not rings at all.  They were effectively frizzled onions that you would see atop of a barbeque burger.  The onion rings were soggy with oil and were WAY over salted.  The amount of salt  made the onion rings inedible to me.

I think that Wahlburgers appeals to those who watch the TV show and caters to the Las Vegas strip crowd that is so drunk when they eat that they can't tell that they're being fed bad food.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Very slow service so if you're in a rush, get takeout or go somewhere else. The burgers initially look small but the patties are thick and juicy. Really tasty burgers! I found the buns too greasy - I think they buttered it but didn't toast them enough. Sweet potato tots were a great alternative to the regular tater tots."}
{"text":"I had good and bad experience here. First part after baseball game came in and service was good. Just had beers with my brother. I left to buy tickets and cane back for a burger.
First, the bar server waited on someone else that came after me. My iPhone was needing charged and the server plugged into a dead outlet. Told her about it and she forgot to come back to fix. I had to remind her. My burger came not as ordered. I asked for only cheese, onion, mustard. I got the works. 
It was medium crowd not busy. No reason for the poor service.
All along I'm seeing a video up on the tv screens telling me a story of Wahlburgers. What a farce. I'm leaving dissatisfied. Maybe better next time. This is their first unit in Cleveland. I don't think it's going to make it. Unless things change."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has a burger joint on every corner and just about every casino. From celebrity Chef, east coast transplants and west coast staples a burger needs to pretty darn good to make it on the strip. This place will last because of it's celebrity/entertainment popularity but not because of  The quality or overall taste of their food.

Stopped in for a late lunch and there was an hour wait. Luckily two spots opened at the bar so we sat within minutes. We briefly waited to order drinks and the food and it was out in a short period of time. The Beast, two 5oz patties, lettuce, tomato, pulled pork, BBQ sauce pickles and a blue cheese sauce. You would think with all those ingredients it would be flavorful and enjoyable, just the opposite! The burger patties had absolutely no flavoring, how bout a little salt or pepper, just greasy meat taste. The salt found its way to the pulled pork and with abundance. It wasn't very shredded more of a cubed pork, poorly constructed for sure. The only decent flavor was from the blue cheese sauce.
With how big the place is you would think they would be better prepared for a crowd of people. One enterance/exit and they have The guests and hostess standing in the doorway, not very organized. I'm sure they will be successful here with all the tourists visiting but I wouldn't waste another minute in this place"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. Staff was friendly and very attentive.  My husband and I ordered a double cheeseburger and split  it.  Wr also orderes French fries.  Everything  was great. We would absolutely go back. I have to say this was one of the best cheeseburgers that we have had in a long time. The bun didn't have too much bread. It wasn't some weird sweet bun. It was just great ."}
{"text":"I was in the area with some co-workers and figured we would try this spot out before it got too crazy. They had a steady stream of customers considering it was lunch time hours, but they weren't busy. We were seated immediately and our server got our drinks quickly ( non-alcoholic of course). We asked for suggestions from the menu and he kindly offered a few items. ( we didn't order any of them) 

I chose the thanksgiving sandwich. I was expecting a Capriottis Bobby squished into a hamburger bun. When the sandwich arrived it didn't look like much ( so I didn't bother taking a picture). The first bite instantly let you know that you were dealing with fresh products. The flavors just stood out. It doesn't have nay overwhelming sauces or any other flare that makes it stand out but it sure as shit did taste like thanksgiving. There was a hint of cranberry beneath the stuffing which I appreciated. I also ordered the sweet potatoe tots. some places screw these things up with terrible oils or by over cooking them. These had a little crunch to them but were soft on the inside. I was pleased for sure. The server then offered us some of their Wahlburg sauce (I know it sounds funny). Its basically some type of mayo, ketchup, siracha mix. Not sure what else was in. Great for dipping fries or tots. 

Overall I though it was nice. It was a little on the pricey side for simple burgers and such, but then again it is located on the strip. I would swing by again if I were in the area, but nothing made me feel like I had to go out of my way to come back again. The service was excellent, and I always appreciate that. That's why It got bumped up to 4 stars instead of 3. Thanks Rob catch you next time sir."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try... had an OFD Burger...Fantastic!!! Cooked perfect - suggest you try a local brew from Vegas only $5.  BTW suggest watching The Gambler"}
{"text":"All that makes this place even somewhat significant is the owner(s). 
Located in an area with fairly high foot traffic outside of Ballys Wahlburgers is the designated burger joint for the outdoor shopping area. 

ATMOSPHERE: 

A kind of bright neon green is the theme color for Wahlburgers, so its hard to miss and also a nice size with indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived at around 7PM and the place was busy, the hostess was somewhat awkward insisting that we sit at the bar but we wanted a table, when she realized we weren't budging they IMMEDIATELY sat us at a table. Not sure why she was so insistent. But nonetheless, we sat and were still excited. 

FOOD:
I must say the full bar at Wahlburgers is the best thing they've got going. However I wouldn't recommend ordering a margarita (which is frozen and premade) it's very sweet. I actually asked for on the rocks but the place was somewhat busy so I didn't want to make my waitor do extra work. 
I got the double decker burger and added  mushrooms with onion strings. 
Other than my burger being cooked medium well which I asked the burger itself didn't taste like it was worth $14 at all. The onion strings
 definitely looked better than they tasted, they weren't awful but I'd probably get fries instead. 

Overall I'd definitely say just go to FIVE GUYS if you want to shell out a few bucks on a burger and if you want to go on the strip go to Burger Bar at Mandalay. 
The odds of me going back are slim, Giordanos is the BEST restaurant you can choose from in the area."}
{"text":"So I go to Vegas with my young son and we see Wahlburgers.  My son and I decided to go there.  We were seated promptly.  However we were not acknowledged for at least ten minutes.  I ordered an our burger medium no onions.  My son ordered a BBQ bacon burger medium.  My burger was rare inside.  I waited about five minutes before I could get someones attention.  I finally had to call out a waitress who walked by.  When I explained to a waiter what I ordered he got a little snippy with me. Saying that medium was pink.  Anyway the waitress came over and apologized and had another one made for me.  When the bill came I put down money and I actually got short changed.  I had to explain this to another waitress.  She quickly gave me the difference.  I don't think the staff pays enough attention to the customer."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in awhile, hands down!! Great food and great people. If you ever want a good burger and some drinks then definitely come here, and ask for JR! Such a great guy, and amazing service. Highly recommend him and his place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"When not busy for it's delivered quick and hot! Very well cooked burger, awesome bar tender it in the patio!!"}
{"text":"This was the second Wahlburgers (Toronto last year) and both visits have been perfect! The staff (from greeting to the check) have been professional & thorough, but most of all, very upbeat and friendly. The food was great as well, but the atmosphere was the clincher!"}
{"text":"Bad service. I was hoping for a great burger. if your from Southern California stick with In-N-out. The employees don't wear name tags and they just walk past you quickly or look the other way. 

When we got seated and waited about 10-15 minutes before someone came to us and asked if we have been helped, we said no and his response was \"I guess I can help you.\" The only reason why my girlfriend and I stayed was because we wanted to try the food. Were we ever disappointed!

The burger toppings were ice cold and that made the burger patty room temperature. I asked for well done and it was still bleeding. I couldn't believe it! the check for 2 \"our burger\" combos came out to $45. We were clearly upset because I basically paid for the name

Never again will I go there. Terrible service, over priced food, bad experience. It's sad that one restaurant can probably ruin this franchise. 

The menu was just plain. On the TV show you hear about the signature burgers of the brothers and I did not see anything. We walked from Luxor to Wahlburgers so we just felt so disappointed on the whole experience of our visit.

We paid and we walked out while all the nameless employees played on their phones and the bartenders were shooting rubber bands at each other. We went on a Monday around 10pm and the restaurant had about 20 guests. This restaurant needs to get some new management and waiters with name tags and or a dress code."}
{"text":"Nothing particularly special about the food but we are partial to Wahlburgers because of our Boston roots! Prices are what you'd expect for a strip place. Service is good!"}
{"text":"Since I live nearby I decided to go and see if another burger place could offer anything better than what's already a saturated market. Advertising of the business is probably done because of Mark.s being a popular actor.  Took about 8 minutes to walk there on a Saturday night. As my ticket reads 9:23PM. The bar had ample seating as did table's I ordered the Our Burger to go. Returned home and it was below my taste liking. I've eaten lots of burgers here in Las Vegas  and this place is one I won't be visiting again. For strip prices 10.95 would be fine If the small burger was a decent burger but it failed my test. I have worked a lot of conventions with food booths. I'm not sure if Wahlburgers  can break into the current competition with their products across the nation. My preference is Carl's jr not only because they had the first Angus beef burger but they haven't sacrificed size and still have a quality product. I looked at some orders being served while waiting and felt the fries and other items were small in size compared to Wendy's  McDonald's.in&out, Johnny Rockets, Jack In the box and other fast food 
places. If you want to pay more for less its your Right to spend your money wherever and for whatever. We have different opinions and taste. This wasn't up to my satisfaction and I will not be recommending to my friends or others. I had really hoped that it would be something to give a four and possibly a five Star rating to but it fell way to short."}
{"text":"First impression was great, but still skeptical. When I saw the prices on the menu, I didn't think the food would be as good, but holy crap it was amazing! At last a great restaurant with reasonable prices! Kept coming back for more during my lunch breaks at a seminar I was attending. The service was also great! This place is on point!"}
{"text":"Traveling from NM. Husband loves the show. We were looking forward to some good food. They ran out of Tator Tots and Onion Rings! Waited 45 mins to get COLD FOOD! My five year old was served a grill cheese that looked like what they serve jailed prisoners! No apologies from waitress or manager. I emailed corporate on this one. Let's see if they respond."}
{"text":"We went in today on our way out of town back to LA. Unless you're walking the strip, access is inconvenient as it is in the outdoor mall at Bally's. You either park in their garage or we parked across the street on Flamingo at some other hotel. Any who, we finally made it there. We went in at 11:15am, no wait. As we learned it just opened 4 weeks ago, and it showed. No tea, no specials (although it is on the menu to ask your server). The server said specials were not available because they did not want to overwhelm the kitchen. 

My wife had the BBQ as a salad. It was good but not cooked to her order. First, it came out as a hamburger (not a salad), and second it was undercooked (she ordered well done, and it was med). She also found something in her salad, and I think we settled on it being some thread from an apron. I had the O.F.D.. It was good, but I would get something else next time. We got the fries. Nothing special at all. 

The table next to us ordered the mac'n cheese and returned it. No clue why, but how can you screw up mac'n cheese. 

As of today, it appeared they were not ready to open, but wanted to open for the summer crowd. They did not even have the proper paper products (soda cups, containers for sides, etc.) They were using styrofoam, and generic paper cups instead of the paper products with the Wahlburgers logo.

We are going back to Vegas in December, and may return to give it another try. If we make it back, I will update this review. I hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Love this place every time we come to vegas. The food is so good and inexpensive. I love the portabella sandwich and haddock. Plus they have gluten free rolls. Service is always fast and attentive."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked up the hostess Daniella said it would be 15-20 min. So we figured we would grab a quick drink at the bar across to wait out of the wind. As soon as we order 4 drinks, she sends a text stating our table was ready. When we asked her why she told us the wait was 15-20 min and saw us walk to the bar right in front her and let us order drinks that we couldn't even consume instead of telling us the wait could be sooner. She was very rude in replying that it was our lucky day to be seated early. She also told the other seater that we were rude. The food was good and Freddy our waiter was nice. The food runner was gross, she brought us out our food and was coughing while doing it. I think they need to do a little more training. It's to bad since I'm a local, I won't be referring anyone else to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The Bartender was great! The food was very disappointing. The burger fell apart in my hand, making it a very messy meal. The onion rings would have been a lot better if they had been cooked long enough. I do not recommend. I really do like the show and wanted it to be a lot better experience."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! 
Great lunch stop.  
The sweet potatoe tots were ok... fries too... not a huge fan of either. 
Burgers fab"}
{"text":"Wow. My initial thought is that these boys probably need to stick to what they do best--acting and dancing. Not opening a bunch of Wahlburger's as fast as they can and then leaving the place high and dry. Speaking of dry, have you had the Thanksgiving burger?! I did. Quite possibly the worst turkey burger I've ever had. The thin patty had barely a smear of butternut squash, the veggie I was looking most forward to. Just a small amount of the cranberry relish, and worst of all... (wait for it)... BOXED STUFFING. I mean, that is totally unacceptable. 

Perhaps my expectations were WAY too high, I got too excited about the possibility of going when my guy moved to Cleveland. We were both excited about going, when we walked in the vibe was busy, bustling and looked fun (Cavaliers in town that night). There was no seating available at 5 pm so we sat at the corner of the bar. Got spoken to almost immediately by one of the servers/bartenders who brought our drinks promptly. Besides that, the service was no more spectacular than that of a fast food counter (I'm a server, my opinion doesn't come from nowhere). I looked around at the plastic chairs and was kind of surprised. Why did I have it in my mind that it was going to be a little more high end, if still a fast food joint? Because in the end, that's basically what it was. When we first walked in my guy exclaimed that he would totally go there before games (he had never been). By the end, after paying and walking out, it sunk in to both of us how bad it really was. Two Thanksgiving burgers, an order of sweet potato tots and an order of regular fries for 28 bucks without tip. Quite frankly, I could have gone to Wendy's, spent less and had a far enjoyable meal. And I don't eat fast food. 

What a total bummer. Get with the program, guys. Boxed, dry and crumbly stuffing?? Maybe your name will sell you no matter what, but our meals were pretty much... gross. Neither of us will go back, not in Cleveland or elsewhere. To end on a high note, I will remark that the sweet potato tots, while very small, came out PIPING hot and stayed hot throughout the duration of the meal. Tiny victory in a sea of disappointments."}
{"text":"My hamburger had a hair in it! We got a full refund but I am paranoid about burgers now... Thanks Wahlburgers"}
{"text":"So did not realize how close this was to Our hotel (Ballys) it was ! Food was really good service was excellent and Victor our waiter very good !! If you come to Vegas u need to stop by !! Watch the show, love the show, happy that the food was as good as the show portrays !!  Highly recommend this place !! Love u Wahlbergs !!"}
{"text":"Went because of the show and the name.  I expect higher prices when in Vegas and at a chain restaurant but the drink prices were too high, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  Sweet potato tots are to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"The decor screams fast food joint. I  was surprised when I was seated with a server

The burgers are overpriced and they don't come with a side. 

The tater tots are the McCains...Frozen tater tots. Seriously. 

Also. don't tell me how much I should tip."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to say I've been too but no desire to return. Hubby loves hamburgers & The Double Decker was a disappointment. The \"confetti\" lettuce tasted too watery, the house pickles tasted weird, the avocado spread wasn't good, and the sauce they use didn't taste good. The Hearty Melt was ok. Would have tasted better without the garlic mayo but maybe that's my personal preference. Apparently we aren't fan of either tater tots. Should of stuck to regular fries but had to try what makes Wahlburgers different. Still a fan of The Wahlburgers but not their food or the price that you pay."}
{"text":"Was surprise this was sssoooo good.. and coming to this place was very Random.. drive by it everyday to go work and come home and mostly notice the name of it and decided to come in and try...and it was so worth it too"}
{"text":"Of course I am like everyone else and wanted to try Wahlburgers due to who owns it. We arrives for an early lunch and surprisingly it was only about a 15 minute wait. We went across the way to a bar to have a drink while waiting. They texted us almost exactly at 15 minutes. I had the \"Our burger\" cooked medium. I would say it was slightly undercooked but not bad. The flavor was good, however, my bun got soggy and started falling apart by my third bite. I also ordered the bacon Mac n' Cheese. Next time this is a definite pass. It was very soupy and somewhat bland. Now that I have checked Wahlburgers off my list of places to try I probably won't be back. It's safe to say there are far better burger place to eat at on the strip."}
{"text":"Tried the burgers because my mom loves the TV show.  The burger is so fresh and the bun is so spongy.  My friend says it's like eating a cloud.  I had the double Decker and added bacon.  Because everything is better with bacon!  The Wahl sauce is like a house made thousand island and the pickles are also homemade.  Very juicy, we'll prepared and the staff is super friendly.  Victor was an amazing server and the food practically flew out of the kitchen.  If you have a sweet tooth I highly recommend the Smores smoothie.  Great food, I will definitely be back before Caesars starts charging for parking."}
{"text":"The food was great! Had a cheeseburger and fries and the burger was juicy but not all drippy like some burgers get. Get the Wahl sauce, it's very good! 

The fries were okay but nothing special about them, I would definitely try a different side next time, maybe the tater tots. 

We were seated fairly quick even though the place was very busy. As we were sitting we watched other people leave after they were done and the table gets cleaned immediately so it's pretty quick turnover. Not to mention it took about maybe ten minutes after ordering for our food to come, we were in and out in probably less than an hour. 

Also, you can't beat the menu prices considering your downtown. Our waitress told us it's affordable because the Wahlburgs grew up poor and they want this to be a place you can come and eat and not break your wallet. I worry that surrounding places in the area may lose many customers just due to how good the prices are! 

All the employees we encountered were all very friendly and happy. 

Make sure you check out the cupcakes on your way out as well, we didn't get one this time but they look soooo good, we'll definitely be picking up one or two next time. 

This is a great addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"We came in 4 deep on a Wednesday afternoon around 2. Jess was out server, and she was fabulous from the second she approached our table. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about with ppl helpers bithching... either you're too finicky or you didn't have Jess, the hostess, food runner, or other server who checked on us during your trip to Wahlburgers.  Food was great.. fresh, full of flavor and cooked to order.  Clean, great music, and even better conversations! 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burger I've ever had!!!  The Hereford, Texas in me came right out here.  The sweet potato tots are truly fantastic."}
{"text":"I've decided to update this review because I was finally contacted by someone within the restaurant management and invited to come back to try it again, so we did so.  This time around, the service was much more attentive, and all of our orders came out correct.  Someone at the table tried the Thanksgiving burger, which he said he far preferred to the regular burger that he had the first time around.  The waitress did a good job suggesting different sauces and condiments to try, and the manager stopped by personally to apologize for our prior visit and to encourage us to offer any feedback we felt might help.  Whereas some of this improved experience might have been intentionally focusing on us because of our prior complaints, we agreed we'd give this another shot in the hopes that maybe now that they've ironed out some of the kinks with management and staffing, that they might be more consistent.  There are still some issues that put this place further down on my list than some other burger restaurants (i.e. the fact that all sides are ala carte, the lack of any kind of shareable appetizers for the table), but that's just what the business is, and not a fault with this particular location.  If you live in the area and don't already have it, download the NoWait app.  It's great for a lot places, but since this place is smaller and always busy, it's nice to be able to \"get in line\" and then leave for the restaurant once you see your table is getting close to being ready."}
{"text":"Came on a work vacation and stopped by. The service was good and the food was good. I mean, nothing really stood out about the place but nothing to complain about. They have a lot of pictures of Mark on the wall wich is cool to take a pic of lol."}
{"text":"Greeted politely by Alicia this afternoon 30/3/17 when I arrived. That is where the service plummeted. Neither of the ladies behind the bar even spoke to us. First the menus were literially plopped in front of us without a word spoken. No smiles anywhere. Satnam walked around sighing and frowning at every customer. The only word she ever spoke to us at all was '\"ready to order\" ? Decent food horrible environment due to the attitude. Seriously would it have killed you to say hello, or ask how my burger was, or to put an orange on my shocktop beer? Sad"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The burgers are okay but not great. I compare them to Steak and Shake. Had the sweet potatoes puffs, frozen in the middle and soggy outside. Asked for a reorder but she didn't get me more. Just threw away the side. Stay out of this place. Nothing good to say."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and always great service! I always get Donnie's favorite the BBQ burger with avocado, never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger and fries and was disappointed. The burger was good but cold. Fries and a side of onion strings was cold too. 
I rarely send food  back but I did send it back. When it came back it was just as cold. 
Maybe it was a busy day but count me out for the next trip back."}
{"text":"Paul.. Mark.. or Donny.. Please revisit the Las Vegas location because they are really f*cking up!!

I was really looking forward to trying this place because I love watching the show! But we had a terrible terrible experience!!

Before we walked in, there was a family already walking out complaining about the rude service.  We just brushed it off. Then the lady with the check in machine said we couldn't go in a until we told her our name and how many people in our party. We gave her the info and walked in, but before we put one foot in the door she said we couldn't go in because we didn't get a text saying our table was ready. We had to wait outside which was about 54 degrees. 

When I finally got a text, we were greeted by the host. He didn't say hi or hello or welcome to Wahlburgers! He said, \"I can't let you in until you finish your outside drink.\" So he just stood at his podium while I chugged my rockstar. He took the can from me and threw it in the garbage! Hey man! Have you heard of recycling? 

The we were greeted by a nice gentleman. I think his name was something like Sicota. I am so sorry if I butchered his name. But he was so nice! 

I ordered the \"Our burger\" first bite you already know the bread was frozen. It was not yet done thawing and they still served a burger on a cold bun. The fries had no flavor! 

Ugh!! Last meal in Vegas and it was so disappointing!"}
{"text":"So we have seen Wahlburgers the show, and I follow Mark on his Instagram, which he personally promotes all of the new establishments that he and his family open.

As we enjoyed our time in Vegas low and behold we see on it the Wahlburger joints right of the strip. As this was my sons birthday trip we asked him as a burger lover if he would like to try this place out, his eye kit up and was eager to get his hands on a Wahlburger. 

We make our way up and are greeted by a personable host who guides us to our table. So far so good, we enjoy the ambiance having two kids with us it was not terribly overly loud. 

Our server introduces herself, but there is a vibe which was not as inviting from this particular server. Non the less she takes our order, which were three Our Burgers. All three had the \"government cheese\" and some special requests. Unfortunately the special request part was not conveyed by the server to the kitchen staff so the orders were not necessarily correct, not biggy, the person who'd brought the food \"not the server\" took back one of the orders for a correction. It was simply no pickles on one, mine was missing the wahlsauce, which i was looking forward to try. I didn't ask for mine to be corrected, and went for it. The buns were soft and perfectly warm, the cold stuff ( lettuce, tomatoes) were fresh and crisp, and the burger itself was cooked to order, mine medium. It was one of the best burgers I've had!
My son had his order adjusted ( minus pickles) and he cannot stop raving about it being the best burger he's ever had. Very nice!! My wife thoroughly enjoyed her burger, and said the pickles were perfect. 

Overall this place is worth it and if I had a local Wahlburger in Murrieta/Temecula it would be our to go place.

Now for the missing star, this is for the waitress, with zero personality, and treated the night like just another job. I get that we all work, I'm a business owner and understand that the key to repeat business is your staff, the team that represents your brand. I would seriously make sure that whoever overseas this region should talk to their employees and understand a bit more what would make their days/nights shifts better in order to ensure the customers are satisfied all around. 

I'll give it up to the Wahlburgs and say they have hit the nail on the head and to keep on pushing the brand. Just be sure the overall experience is one that would make your customer come back to continue and enjoy your burgers."}
{"text":"We had to wait for a table for about 15 minutes but it was worth the wait. I had the. Bbq bacon burger and my husband had the double. Both were delish. The onion strings were tasted and we liked the sweet potato tots. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"I have been here once because it is in the busy las Vegas strip. I got a simple burger which tasted super juicy and yummy!  The French fries tasted good as well. We decided to be adventurous and get the sweet potato tot. Those were okay. But everything else was amazing! I only put four stars because of how busy it gets."}
{"text":"Food was off the chain. Service was good. Food came out fast  fresh burgers  will be back"}
{"text":"A great burger stop on the strip. Nice location and great burgers. Service was excellent and on the spot. Great place!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at this location food was great.Staff was very friendly...Had the Jenn's chicken sandwich very pleased shared fries with family.Just an insight fries are not that special you can skip them"}
{"text":"I completely enjoyed my dining experience at this place!
Our waitress was very nice and attentive. Food came out extremely fast even though they were a bit busy. And burgers were delicious! 
As a restaurant owner myself, I know for sure not everyone will have the best experience every time. But I think they did a good job on offering simple, yet very decent and original menu. 
The only thing that surprised me, is not having a restroom inside of the restaurant. However, there is one right outside the door. 
Good job!"}
{"text":"Cyndy's Bottom Line:  A decent burger when you need one and a drink.

Stopped in for a burger while awaiting our flight.

A good burger with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and sauce.  A delicious burger when you want it.  Tasty and delicious.  I like the way they do the lettuce shredded and a good amount of pickles.  

The burger is cooked one way which is well done.  I ordered some tater tots which were nicely seasoned, crispy and crunchy.

Good service."}
{"text":"This place has been on my Vegas bucket list for a while. Our server, Chris was AMAZING!! 
The food is REALLY REALLY good! We ended up coming back the following day for more. It's a good thing we don't have one of these back home. We'd be in trouble."}
{"text":"Our Wahlburgers experience was great. We purposely went in AFTER the Cavs game started to avoid the crowd. We were seated quickly and several friendly staff chatted with us as we quickly got our drinks. 

All three of us ordered burgers. My 14 year old is an extremely picky eater and  he devoured his food. The soft, fresh buns and the perfectly cooked burgers were some of the best we've had. Fried egg on my hubs sandwich was exactly right... just the right amount of yolk oozing over the 1/3 lb burger. The carmelized onions on my burger were sweet and plentiful and cooked just right. 

These were  the best burgers we have had  in CLE. (and we live here) The super thin, not greasy thinly sliced onion rings and Wahlburgers sauce we equally as tasty. 

The burgers and sides were plentiful portions. We will be back and will save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in while here on vacation. I really liked the quality of their burgers, and the server was knowledgeable and friendly. We had a friend with us who may have been a little more difficult to serve than he needed to be, and our server was patient and laughed it off."}
{"text":"If I could give a -5 star review I would. When I sat down at the bar, the waitress took that opportunity to clean it throwing crumbs and a piece of paper on my lap unapologetically. She did not come to take my order. I had to get her attention even though she was standing in front of me. She disappears and comes back with my food 15 minutes later. 

When paying, she gave me the check while having a conversation with someone else without thanking me for paying for the food and service.

The burger was low quality and the sweet potato tater tots were good although not memorable. It's not something I'll crave in the coming days.  

I had low expectations and this experience made it worse. In my own opinion, I believe movie celebrities have an unfair advantage in the food industry simply because of their fame unrelated to cooking skills. 

Recommendation: If you have better service at locations that are not in airports I strongly suggest making sure it's equal at all locations. A bad experience in service will drive people away even if your food is acceptable."}
{"text":"Place was packed but it just opened.  I had the BBQ bacon burger and my date had the Our Burger. Both were cooked exactly how we wanted them.  The garlic mayo mustard dish was really good with sweet potato tots.  Service was excellent for how busy and new the place is.  Cant wait to go back even though my date sucked."}
{"text":"I'm a burger guy. The burger had no flavor and I didn't taste Paul's special sauce on the burger. The reason for 1 rating 3 burger 4 soft drink 2 fries and kids meal cost me $75 not including the tip.In and Out burger would cost me $25 with 4 fries and the burgers have more flavor. Great disappointment as big fan of the show."}
{"text":"Super Busy even on a Sunday. To be expected since its directly on the strip and a big chain. Party of 4 sat at bar right away since everyone wanted regular tables. Good for us! Got served right away..super friendly staff and the whalburger here tasted better than my local one. However, just for me to get my monster burger, 1 beer and fries was $40....those vegas prices! Still would come back."}
{"text":"Just had one of the burgers here at the Burger tasted great! But when it was first presented it definitely did not look like it was worth the money they are charging for it. The service was very good in the beginning and then just kind of stopped. No one even came over to ask if I joined the food or if I wanted anything else. I would recommend it if you want to just try something new and you want kind of a tasty burger but I would not come in expecting amazing service!"}
{"text":"If you go to Vegas make sure to visit this place,they are famous for their burgers . I wasnt very happy with the food,first of all it was cold,especially my fries,then the customer service was horrible,our server was a blonde girl,with attitude and very mean and unhappy. But anyway the burger was delicious. One more great thing about this place are the most beautiful pictures in frames that we purchased ,its such a great thing that they take pictures,its a memory for me and my husband,the picture girls were the nicest in this restaurant. We will come back very soon !"}
{"text":"After a night of drinking over at Bound at The Cromwell, I was hungry for a burger at around 2am.  But I didn't want to walk all the way back White Castle or McDonald's.  So thank goodness for Wahlburgers being nearby (actually across the street at Bally's where I was staying at) and open till 4am!

I had the Double Decker and opted for Yukon Gold Fries.

The Double Decker w/ caramelized onions (+$1)  -- http://bit.ly/2iqrH43
Two 3 oz. burgers, lettuce, tomato, onion, \"Government\" cheese, Paul's signature Wahl sauce & housemade pickles.
The burger was huge!  Definitely satisfied my craving for the night.  Though I thought the burger was somewhat lacking in flavor due to all those veggies.  I probably would've been better off ordering the Dad's Basic Burger which excludes the veggies.

It really was a mistake for me to order the Yukon Gold Fries.  Of all the types of fries, in my opinion, steak fries are an abomination and that's what these were.  So while it's not completely their fault they sell these fries, I wish they had a thinner cut instead.  They're just too thick and starchy for me.  I should've opted for Tater Tots.  Oh well.  At least my waiter hooked me up with extra Wahl Sauce to dip the fries in.

Overall, my experience at Wahlburgers was okay.  I liked the convenience how they were at Bally's and I had a cool waiter so no problems with service.  It's a great late night burger option, though more on the pricier side since I paid around $28 after tax and tip for a burger combo meal."}
{"text":"There are so many good options downtown and this is not one of them.  Food is mediocre and the concept is trite."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers at a casual burger joint. I would try this place for lunch and have anything on the menu.  Whatever you order make sure you do try the burgers! They are made just right and so tasty! They even serve the \"impossible\" burger which is vegetarian and it tastes like an actual meat burger even though it's plant based. You'll enjoy the food."}
{"text":"It's great service, and cool atmosphere. Amazing onion rings, but only an ok burger, at best. The mac and cheese with bacon was horrible...very dry."}
{"text":"Very good burgers being a person that lives in the suburbs, I was downtown last weekend for the whole weekend at the MTCC and I ate at Wahlburgers every day. The portobello cap burger and the 1/3 melt were my favorite. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I need to start by saying... I love NKOTB & Wahlburgers so I didn't expect to dislike it !!!! :) I was sooooo excited to give this place a try. I've heard they can have a sizable  wait so we chose to go around 2 on a Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately! 

The atmosphere is bright (they offer outdoor seating but it was still too chilly) and everyone we dealt with was extremely friendly and offered their suggestions as far as the menu! 

I ordered the BBQ Bacon (Donnie's fav, which it indicates next to all three brothers) and it was delicious! I don't usually order a burger when I'm out to eat, but this one was made perfectly and very good!! I got sweet potato tots which were YUM (who doesn't love tots?) and my bf tried the French fries which they recommend dipping in their Wahl sauce... wow! That stuff is addicting and GOOD. 

Yes, it's a little touristy and people may doubt the food... but to me, the quality, price, and atmosphere was all great! We'll be back ! :)"}
{"text":"The food was meh at best. My medium burger came out rare and cold and so did the $5 tots. Asked for hot tots and a medium burger. Got more lukewarm tots and a well done dried out burger. Thanks for a crappy birthday lunch Wahlburgers."}
{"text":"Delicious! Loved our first time visiting and dining at Wahlburgers! Friendly service and the food was delicious. We even got a souvenir cup!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight! I ordered the lightly breaded fish sandwich. Very very delicious!! A little bit of a wait, as its on the strip. It was worth the wait. Also our server was efficient. And always checked in on us. Nice first time experience!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers...But! Too Pricey, you're paying for the name which won't keep locals coming back. We sat at the bar because it was too long of a wait and a very hot day...one thing that did happen was a person who works there was delivering ice to the bar and as he was closing bar lid to go into the bar he grabbed a bar rag out of the Sink that is in the bar and the dirty rag water ran into to the ice buckets....it grossed everyone out...I told the bartender and she made him get new ice before she put it into the ice containers on the bar counters but if I had t told her she would have never known..,he was careless."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE but sure was empty when I came for dinner. I had the burger and the onion rings here. The burger was really disappointing. The buns are cheap and thin and disintegrated in my hands, especially with the thick pickles and raw onions poking through it. The meat itself is mediocre. For some reason, the burger was CHEWY, like how a taffy is chewy, which is NOT a texture that a burger should have at all.

The onion rings here though are divine. They're not the typical big thick onion rings, but very finely sliced so they're crispy like an onion bloom would be without the soggy middle interior. I might actually come back for the onion rings, although it was really depressing sitting in that big empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Overall Wahlburger was fine. The novelty of going was fun, the burgers were fine. It was decently priced. I wouldn't make a date out of it but if you want to grab a quick and not so fancy burger, it's a good spot. 

Note: their onion rings are NOT onion rings. They were crispy onions, which is fine on a burger but don't order them as a side."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place since I have seen the show! Always a fan besides being a foodie! My guy had tried the burgers on his last trip to Vegas, and really liked it. He wanted me to get the experience he had when he came in. We showed up on a Thursday evening after he picked me up from the airport. He was already in town. I was starving after spending a whole day waiting out some layover time at the SFO airport so the first thing I wanted to do was eat. He knew just where to take me. We were able to walk right in and get seated right away. The service was excellent. I wish I would have grabbed a name because our server went above, and beyond to make sure I got to try all of the wonderful sauces. Our drinks were always full, and our food was out really fast. I think the burger we had was called the melt? I am not positive. But it was very good. It was on toasted  bread. I enjoyed dipping it in one of the sauces that was kind of sweet/ spicy. The tots, and fries are very delicious as well. If we had one of these in my town I would be a regular. Next time I am in the area I am going to have to stop in. 

**I saw someone write about their burger not being all the way cooked, we were asked how we liked ours cooked. I am pretty sure you can tell them how you like your burgers if you don't like it pink inside."}
{"text":"I was with Dante R. On November 14, 2015. I wanted to add. That NO I would never go back, in fact, the best part of my experience was leaving. I swear people facing the electric chair get better customer service than we received. We could of gone to one of my favourate pubs and gotten better service and better food and at a cheaper price. People of Toronto if your looking for a place to eat, skip this place!"}
{"text":"First time trying Wahlburgers. I got the Mac n Cheese and some tots. The Mac n Cheese was really good! Very cheesy and filling. The portions were plenty big. Everyone was friendly and service was very quick."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Wahlburgers. Ultimately I was disappointed. The amount we paid was outrageous. For basically a burger and fries
 $78 for 3 burgers, 1 fry and 3 drinks. Seriously???"}
{"text":"Big fan of the show and had to try it out.  Went on a wednesday night, very quiet with no wait at all.  I ordered the Our Burger and onion rings.  Just a small tip, don't order the onion rings if you are by yourself.  HUGE portion.  Normally not a problem but what was I going to do with them all?!  Nice and paper thin, perfect.  Burger was wonderful.  I prefer the shredded lettuce over a hard slab of lettuce so I was very happy with my burger.  Maybe a bit more sauce but overall I very much enjoyed.  I wanted to try the mac and cheese but that will have to wait until the next time I am in town.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to see a comedy show at Second City. Only came here because the show was starting in 30mins and we've never been there. I honestly have no idea how this place survives. The only thing that is keeping them above float is their location - because it's a high traffic area for Roger's centre and surrounding areas.They prey on poor chumps like me who are looking for something quick and easy. But their food takes long and its expensive for below average burgers. I ordered the sliders - came with mini thanksgiving burger, our burger, and bbq bacon burger. The thanksgiving burger decent - the rest were gross. Dont expect your burgers to come with fries either. The price is just for the burger itself - and if you want other toppings - that's extra as well. Nothing special about this place. Would not return or recommend to anyone. I would have been happier with a $3 street dog instead."}
{"text":"I liked it!
It was super busy, but we were seated right away. My husbands burger was undercooked and waiter forgot my daughter's soda, but it was corrected right away and the service was friendly. The onion rings were awesome and so was the government cheese.  $75 for three of us and that included a souvenir beer glass and the tip."}
{"text":"Hamburgers were actually good but more than anything after watching this series on TV the family and I just wanted to try it out. We are sure glad we did!

*Thanksgiving Day Sandwich
*Our Burger
*Mom's Sloppy Joe
*BBQ Bacon
*Onion Fries
*Sweet Potato Tots
*Mac n Cheese w/ Bacon (side)"}
{"text":"Vastly overrated. Went with a couple friends this weekend and was so disappointed. The layout is very modern and hip but other than that everything else was disappointing. The food is overpriced and don't even think about ordering any alchohol because the prices are a joke. I believe a bottle of beer goes there for 8 bucks... The burger I ordered was good but not great. The service there was terrible too don't get me started on that. Hundreds of better burger joints in toronto that are way cheaper and better than this one don't let yourself get fooled by the hype."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved that place! Our server was really nice and took my order down correctly given that I'm a very picky person. It's didn't take extremely long for the food to come out and once it did, I was not disappointed. I took one bite of my barbecue bacon burger and fell in deep lust. (Can't use the word love since it was only our first date) lol. The burger was cooked perfectly and I ordered a side of onion rings which I ended up putting inside my burger which took it to the next level! I would definitely recommend anyone who is a fan of the show or who is just curious, to try it!"}
{"text":"This place is good. I'm glad we tried it, but we probably won't return. The food is tasty but the quantity and quality are not worth the price. We did however receive fast service.
4.5 for the taste and atmosphere
3 for the price versus quantity/quality
3.5 overall
Also, not included in the assessment above is 1/5 - didn't meet Mark Wahlburg."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night about 9:30 pm. Seated within 15 minutes. Can't remember the name of the burger I ordered. It was the plain ole burger with pickles lettuce and tomato. The burger was great. I got sweet potato tots on the side. They have sugar added as noted on the menu. I ordered them but they were a bit too sweet for me. Liked the idea of a souvenir photo while at the restaurant but not while we're sitting down to eat. Felt trapped into taking and purchasing a photo. I didn't come here for a photo. I get up selling for cash flow but maybe before the party is seated in a designated area and then approached about purchase at point of paying for the bill instead. Food overall was good."}
{"text":"Everything was so good here. I had the grilled cheese with bacon, my mom had the homemade chili, and it was so good. Our server Amber was really nice and attentive. We also got to get out picture taken."}
{"text":"The Mac and Cheese with Bacon is delicious. Their children's burger was just okay. The waitress was extremely nice and worth the trip back for the service alone.  The onion rings were really good and they do not need any dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here because my daughter's a fan and I was in town for business. I first want to say that I thought my burger was delicious (the Dad one) and so was the poutine. Now for the bad news. I paid $18 for a burger and poutine with a child's drink. Not what I want to pay for lunch but for a one time stop, I'm OK with it. I have to say that although the burger was delicious, it was tiny! I'm a smaller woman so it was good for me but any guy would most likely have to get two, so there's that to consider. And there's just too much Mark stuff - geez!

I did get a chuckle as well as a lunch, compliments of the two ladies who were taking orders at the cash registers. I asked where I could wash my hands and they looked at each other and then at me and one said, \"I guess over there\" pointing to the server station with a tiny sink. \"Do you not have a bathroom?\" I asked. Then the lightbulbs went off and I was directed to the ladies room. Then I asked if they had wifi in the restaurant and again, looked at each other and then me and said, \"I think so but it's probably only for employees\". No light bulb this time, but I was amused and felt like I was in a Saturday Night Live skit!

I won't return, but I'll remember it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night bite. I got the \"our burger\" and side of fries came out to about $17 overpriced for what you get but typical for a burger joint on the strip. Nothing really special. Very overrated. But as expected with a celebrity owned restaurant. Luckily I came really late and there wasn't a big line. Had I waited in the long lines during the day it would have been a big disappointment. They wouldn't charge the food to my room. And also I found a bread tag on the bottom of my burger! I won't be back."}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday so we reserved our table ahead of time for a party of 13 via telephone. Place was very busy considering it's located on the Strip in front of Bally's. So it was a good thing reservations were available to us. Our party didn't have to wait when we got there and was immediately seated to our table right next a mural of the Wahlburg Family lol. 

FYI, it's so much easier and faster to just valet your car at Bally's because Wahlburgers is located just on the other side this a short walking distance. The only catch is that you have to pay $15 for Valet. This sure beats parking at the garage which is takes up way more time to get there. 

On to the menu! It was very detailed and of course had their favorite item selections printed in bold for the curious first timers to share what the Wahlburgs like personally.  If you have young ones with you, they also carry Kids meals (Smahlburgs) with fries. And let's not forget about the Vegans as well. I recommend their \"Portabello Sandwich\" loaded with mushrooms and other veggies. ($10.95)  Most of the menu selections are pretty healthy choices considering most of them are burgers or sandwiches. 

I went with their famous housemade \"Mom's Sloppy Joe!\" ($11.95)   Of course I had to respect Momma Wahlburg and experience her recipe because that's what a momma's boy should do. Lol I also recommend selecting the thin cut onion rings as the side dish. Did I forget to mention that when you order a burger, the side of fries comes as a meal. 

Personally I did not like their \"Mac 'n Cheese with Smoked Bacon\" because it was lacking mostly the cheese. Don't get me wrong, all the ingredients put into this was delish but it's just not the same without the motherload of cheese needed. ($7.95)

To top it all off, I was still hungry for some dessert, so I ordered \"IBC Rootbeer and Creamsicle Floats\" all around the table. ($7.95 each) 

I can't forget to mention that all our orders came out quick!! Our server and the cook behind the grill served up some hot plates so fast and accurate, I was very pleased! 

Also, if you want your picture taken, there's a photographer going around table to table giving out small complementary photos for free and bigger photos for sale. don't tell anyone I told you this, but it's just better to whip out your own phones and have someone take it for you for free"}
{"text":"Wahlburgers is pretty good. I like the fact I can get a beer and I'm sure others appreciate the cocktails. My first visit was a late lunch and I sat in the bar. The bartender was very friendly and the service was awesome. My second visit was dinner during Happy Hour. I sat out on the deck and the service was also good. Both times I had the \"OurBurger\" and I liked it a lot. I liked the tater tots much better than the fries. I will have to try the sweet potato tots next time."}
{"text":"Loved their burgers, sweet potato tots and onion strings. They got us right in and the service was super quick. This has become one of our favorite burgers spots in Las Vegas. Try the different sauces because they are so unique! All of the sides can be shared because they are big portions. The kids meals also come with fries now. We love wahlburgers!"}
{"text":"While on the strip we decided to try this restaurant out.  First, the hostess was a little annoyed that we did not have cell phones so they could text us when our table was ready.  She told us to stand by her so she didn't forget us, then said it would be about 45 minutes.  This was her best solution to people (rare as it is) who do not take their cell phones everywhere.  Anyway, went in, saw the menu and first thing I thought way ...Geez Wahlberg brothers;  you don't make enough money so you have to charge Ala carte for fries with a sandwich.  I realize this is on the strip and rent must be high, but seriously????  I will say thank you for making the plain burger a dollar less then the cheeseburger...more places need to do this. We waited about half hour for our food to come out.  The burgers were good, nothing special.   My husband had ordered the pulled pork on his burger and had to drain half a cup of oil off the pork before he could eat it.  Truly, the entire bottom of his basket was dripping as was the burger.  He called the server over and told her and her reply was \"Yes, it is oily\" then brought him napkins to wipe up the oil that was now on the table. The family \"special\" sauce tasted just like thousand island dressing without the relish.  While we were waiting a lady came and asked if we wanted a free picture postcard;  we said no.  She replied \"but it is free\".  We said no again.  Again she said it is free, you don't have to buy anything (I understand the concept of free lady)Really, I am hanging out with my husband and you are bothering me????  when we received our bill there was a $4.95 charge for the pulled pork but the menu said this add on item was $1.  when I questioned the server she said \"Sorry, sometimes the kitchen gets confused\".  Not sure what that is all about as she rang up our bill, but he removed it.  The place is VERY noisy!  but it was nice looking at the pictures."}
{"text":"After seeing the show and visiting the city for a ball game we decided to check the place out. We were told an hour wait, but gladly it was only 30 or so minutes, glad we didn't venture to far. 

I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and sweet potato tots and was moderately happy with my meal. The meal itself was pretty good (by no means the best burger I have ever had) but it was pretty tasty. For $10.50 for JUST the burger and $4.50 for the tater tots I am not impressed. My burger was no where near worth that much, was expecting a larger meal for $15. 

The place is pretty busy, but I was happy we gave it a try. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon, as there are many other places in the area to try. 

If you are looking for a place for a burger and side, and don't mind paying for an average meal, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Hostess was fantastic, server was fantastic, food was fantastic. What can I say? We were not expecting it to live up to it's hype but it blew us away."}
{"text":"I am very surprised by the sub par review of this burger joint! I for one really enjoyed the burgers here! Though it quickly becomes obvious that Wahlburgers charges a premium on their menu items for being a celeb-owned resto. As pricey as it may be for a modest-sized burger, I would still recommend it. 

I went for the 'Eh' burger, which is a protein powerhouse, comprising of: a fried egg, beef pattie, and peameal bacon. I teamed it with the sweet potato tots, which I must say, was an excellent combo (counteracting the savoury with the sweet). Not to mention, sweet potato tots were priced the same as the fries and onion rings, which is unusual but nice!

The regular burger (5 oz) is stacked tall but modest in diameter and circumference. If I can compare it to anything, it would be a large slider. But don't let that discourge you, the content of the burger is made to perfection, albeit very messy to eat. If you are a big eater, you may want to upsize the burger to 8 oz. The tots surpassed my expectations and then some. They were crispy on the outside with a perfect sweet center. This is a must-try for all sweet potato enthusiasts out there."}
{"text":"Came with some friends. Got the sloppy joe and my hubby got the ofd with tater tots. They were both delicious!! Taters were nice and crunchy and our waitress was attentive and accommodating. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian.  Just trying to eat better si I got the impossible burger Walhbugers vegetarian burger. Yummy!!!!! I would eat that again. It was like eating any other burger. My sons got a super melt and like it as well. The fries were crispy and the staff friendly. If I have one issue it would be the price. The burgers do not come with fries or a side of any kind. And $31.00 for lunch for 2 people is a little pricey.   It will come back for dinner maybe."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC. Celiacs, they have GLUTEN FREE buns, bread, and croutons- all house made! I had the \"our\" burger (gluten free bun) with tater tots and my boyfriend had the BBQ burger with sweet potato tots. Tasty, fresh, and reasonably priced. We ended up going back before we ended our trip! This place is a must. Big THANK YOU to the Wahlberg family for creating the most accommodating restaurant for people who cannot eat wheat gluten that I've ever eaten at. To have not only the option to eat a burger the way it's meant to be eaten (not lettuce wrapped), but to offer the same accommodation for sandwiches and even croutons on a salad is just beyond thoughtful and considerate. It's not a small thing, so thank you so much."}
{"text":"came here with the fam on a weekday lunch so it wasn't crowded and there was no wait. location wasn't that great and there's so much construction but the place itself is nice, clean, well kept. service and other staff are friendly. i had a regular cheeseburger and it was good but kinda basic. the eh burger was really good though. that is enough to bring me back. the tots are pretty basic and so was poutine but the onions rings were really good. def check it out."}
{"text":"Yay, great airport food.  I love this place. My breakfast option this morning at 10:45. 

I'm so excited I have a great burger option while waiting for my flight to start boarding.  Staff is so super friendly.  Food is fresh and made to order.  

I'm in Toronto a lot so I will be back, many times."}
{"text":"It's edible I guess.  My major complaint is the burger had no seasoning whatsoever.  Seems they rely heavily on the sauce and condiments on the burger.  But salt and pepper makes a burger tasty.  Also don't buy any cocktails it's just really watered down.  Oh and be prepared for the bill to be ridiculous for an unseasoned burger and fries."}
{"text":"I went here first time on 10/6 looking forward to a good burger and to finally taste a wahlburger. Well i was very disappointed and will not go back. I ordered a burger and tater tots & beer. Beer and tater tots were great. Now for the burger come the disappoinment. First the cheese was cold and not melted and the bun was cold. The meat wasnt very cooked either. Not coming back"}
{"text":"First off I have to say that I LOVE that Wahlburgers is open at 8am. We were so hungry and didn't want breakfast food. Not everyone wants to eat breakfast food early in the morning.  I wanted a mean cheeseburger! And I got one! This place makes a great cheesy juicy burger. It was awesome and I will be back for another one. 

The other thing is, I love their location.  Easy to get to and pretty much the middle of the strip. Love it!"}
{"text":"Being a faithful viewer of the TV show, I knew I had to go to this place while in Vegas over the weekend. What a joke. I have to give this 1 star to post this review but I wouldn't have given them any. After waiting 40 minutes to get in, my family and I were seated in a corner to fend for ourselves. Waiting for 10 minutes, we finally waved a waiter down to bring us menus and water. The menu only had a few options and the prices were ridiculous. We ordered the $13.00 bugers and $4.95 fries. Our food came and 2 employees argued with each other right in front of us over whose order was whose. Onto the food. The fries and tater tots were cold. They made 2 of the burgers wrong and mine was so salty I couldn't even eat it. We again got the attention of our waiter and he made no attempt to make it right. We then asked to speak to the Manager. After another 15 minutes, she came over and we shared our experience with her. She offered new burgers but after everything else that already happened, we were over it. She did take 1 burger off of our bill however; this overall experience was terrible. It's too pricey for burgers you can't even eat. My sister lives in Vegas and told us not to go. We should have listened and would have been better off at McDonalds. Totally disappointed. I watched an episode of Whalburgers were Paul was hand  picking employees for this location. Was that scripted like the rest of their show?"}
{"text":"If there is one thing Vegas isn't lacking in, it's burger joints.  From lowbrow to high-end, we almost have them all.  Wahlburgers apparently felt that there was room for one more overpriced chain in our market, so of course I had to check it out.  

Unfortunately, we chose a hot weekend day to visit and the wait was an over an hour long (waiting is outside).  They do use the texting system, so at least we could peruse the lackluster Grand Bizarre shops while we waited (I still don't get these shops).  We were texted that our table was ready about 65 min later and seated.

I question the layout of this space.  1. Because I'm not sure how anyone would know that they have a takeout counter in the back of the restaurant if you just want to pick up food and leave.  They don't even let you in the door to get on the wait list.  It's done outside.   2. We were seated at a booth with an I-beam at the edge of our table.  Horrible view, to say the least.  They should have been able to plan the seating better.

It took some time for our server to come over, so we were fully prepared to order when he arrived.  We got the Our Burger $10.95, the OFD $12.95, mac n' cheese $7.95, and an order of tots for $4.95, plus 2 fountain drinks $3.95 ea.  The food itself was pretty good; if I were at a quick service restaurant and the bill was $25, not $50 (plus tip) for paper cups and plastic ware.  The burgers at The Habit are as good, if not better, for a 1/3 of the price.

I think it will do well with tourists, but for locals it's probably a one and done kind of place IMO."}
{"text":"As a foodie I was looking forward to having a good meal at Wahlburgers especially after all the hype it gets on the tv show. Instead I had a horrible experience starting with my server who didn't know anything about the menu and then gave me an attitude when I ask if I can alter my order as I am allergic to certain foods. 

Then I had the chicken sandwich and it was horrible.

If you are looking for something good and fast to eat, cross the street to Gretzky."}
{"text":"Overpriced burgers, which don't come with sides unless you order them separately. Many of the burgers are very sloppy to eat as well.  It was empty when we went in - and for good reason."}
{"text":"As another vegetarian reviewer said: not a lot to choose from.  I agree, is it so hard to have a simple garden burger patty on the menu?  Lots of places do it, but maybe that's more of a Californian thing.

I didn't actually go in but I walked passed it every day and man it's loud.  They blast their TV noise on the street.  I do not need to know what you are watching, nor do I want to!

My dad went down to get us some fries when our delivery was taking forever and came back with fries, tots, and onion rings.

First off SKIP THE ONION RINGS.  They were ok for the first 2 bites but they are literally just nothing.  They are not big and crispy.  They're what you put on burgers if you want crispy onions.  They should not sell these as onion rings.  Also, they smelled bad afterwards and the smell lingered for 2 days.  Made me feel queasy.

French fries good.

Tator tots not good either!  Sad.  It is not hard to mess up a spud puppy, you guys, but it's basically like a mashed potato ball from here.

Skip skip skip."}
{"text":"This place is defiantly overhyped. Skipped lunch at work so I can indulge here. Ordered BBQ BACON burger $12.95 and fries $4.95. Burgers do not come with fries unless it's a kids meal. Even though my burger sounded like it had a lot of goodies (avocado, BBQ, jalapeño) inside... It was bland. It looked and sounded tasty... But I'd rather much eat at IN-N-OUT or Red Robins when it comes to burgers. Our server wasn't too friendly either."}
{"text":"Service was great, fun and enjoyable. The food was really below average. Burger King is better, don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"I thought the burger was really really good except for one thing: it was soooooo greasy. Like dripping with grease. It was good and went down easy but I felt so gross afterwards. The sides are all separate and they're huge so definitely just share. I got the onion ring things and liked them a lot. Just way too big of a portion."}
{"text":"We weren't sure about coming here after seeing only a 3 star rating and reading some of the reviews. But we like the Wahlbergs and really wanting to give them a try.  We had outstanding service and the food was really good. We loved the sweet potato taters. Both me and my wife liked our burgers. The only reason we didn't rate it a 5 star was because we have had better burgers but this is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Great service and great burgers. I also love the sweet potato tater tots. I walked in sat at the bar got service immediatly and had my food within 15 mins on a packed Friday!"}
{"text":"Went in to order food at the register. So we went to sit at the table & the waiter came over to inform we couldn't sit at the tables inside but had to go outside. I feel this was very rude & not giving 1st class service. I don't know if we will be coming back. Not happy!!!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment.
I respect Marky Mark and was hoping for the same in my burger.

Double Decker was not a delight. It seemed as if the patties were smaller than the regular patties, I'd say even slider size. Dry and not saucy - where was the sauce Mark?

Stale Buns all around. 

Tater Tots - delicious, but for $3.50 I can buy a whole McCains bag on my way home! 

Bbq Bacon -
Where do I begin. No avocado, flimsy bacon, and the same dry bun.

Not a pleasant waiting staff experience to say the least. I won't be back."}
{"text":"As a Boston girl, I really liked this place! Great burgers cooked exactly how you want them and fast. I got the double decker without cheese and with the pickles on the side. Really juicy skinny patties which I liked. I got the regular tater tots. I originally wanted the sweet potato tots but our waiter brought us just tots. Still tasty though! Great place if you want good fast food with some Boston charm."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday about 11:15am.   There were a few tables already sat.  So not to busy when we got there.

I have to say, after reading some of the reviews I was worried about the service.  But I have to say everyone we encountered was super nice.  I really have no complaints.

The food was good too.  I got the melt w/the caramelized onions/mustard/bacon/cheese/etc.   it was very good and cooked perfect!   Same with my sons double burger, he enjoyed it and was done perfect.   We also opted for the onion rings which are very tasty, I didn't even use the sauce it came with.  The homemade lemonade was very good.   And omg, you HAVE to get the apple empanadas!!!  Soooooo good! 

They do have outside seating which is nice.  
We will be back, but will avoid it when there are events in cle."}
{"text":"Fries were barely warm. Burger was juicy but average. Pricey $25 for frappe, burger and fries. First and last time visiting. Plus, love my line :("}
{"text":"World famous and delicious. A
Must when ur on the strip. Or any place u can find one of these. Hoping they bring one to San Diego."}
{"text":"The waitress we had tonight gave us the worst service we've ever received from anyone. She treated us as if we were an imposition on her time. I had to speak to the manager once during the meal because we asked her for sauce and it took her almost ten minutes to get us 'prepackaged' sauce. Then when she gave us our check, she then went to the front to have a long chat with the hostess and we waited almost 20 minutes before getting up to go to the front and pay for our meal. As we were walking to the front the same waitress passed me, twice, and completely ignored me. I then told my husband to go get her tip from the table and asked the hostess to process my bill. The hostess then went over to the waitress, in front of me, and told the waitress I wasn't giving her a tip and they both started laughing about it. The waitress then came and slammed the bill with my credit card in front of me and said in a nasty tone,\" Have a nice night!\" and stalked off. I then told her to get the manager and advised her on her rude and disgusting behaviors/customer service. She then walked over to the bar, where the manager was making a drink, and she advised that a customer wanted to see him. He asked her why and she stated ,\" oh I was rude to her\". They then joked about it, in front of me and my family, and she walked away. The manager came over to us and apologized for the waitresses behavior,  but after all of the above I was disgusted. I really hope to talk to a general manager, or possibly one of the Wahlburgers to find out why these behaviors are tolerated and encouraged amongst the staff."}
{"text":"Just ate there earlier today.. Only about a 20 minute wait.. Ordered a open face sloppy joe, Mac & cheese with smoked bacon. It was good, still prefer a sloppy joe on a bun then a slice of bread.. They have gluten free buns if you choose... The service was friendly and fast. The only thing holding me back from a 5 star; was that they were out of the Apple empanadas.. Wanted to bring one home for dessert."}
{"text":"The burger was very good but not worth the price. I know it is in an airport but $10 bucks is overpriced.
Edit: I have updated my review because after trying InandOut burger in Cali I realized that the quality of this burger is worth $10 bucks."}
{"text":"I went there first time on Sunday. I was really disappointed. I was expecting delicious juicy burger with some unique twist on it. instead of that I got old stale bun with half dissent patty. Their signature Sos was nothing special. I didn't order fries but they brought me them anyway and they tried to charge me for it. Service is horrible. They will take your order and never come back. Forget about drink refills. Don't go!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and Fernanda was awesome! She was so patient with us, as we are very picky, and such an outgoing and personable employee. We haven't even gotten our food yet (we just ordered) and we will come back just to see her! Best service we have had in Vegas. Love her!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good burger at a decent price on the strip, check out Wahlburgers. I do suppose it's a tad hyped up because of the name, but this was a place I'd been trying to visit since my Vegas trip last year and barely got around to it this time around.

It was a weeknight when we came by, but the place was busy. We decided to sit on the patio. The interior isn't very big and I can see it getting crowded on busier nights. Heat lamps were available for the chilly evening. Menus came out quickly and drink orders taken.

I had the \"Our Burger\" which is their basic. It'll set you back 9.95 (or 10.95 with cheese). I had it cooked medium well and that's how it arrived. The burger is good, nothing mind blowing.  I snagged a few fries from my friend, which were also standard. Drinks are served in a green souvenir cup made of a nice reusable plastic, a nice little keepsake. Service was good and efficient."}
{"text":"Best burger ever. The beast by far outweighed what I thought. I am defiantly headed back. The waiter was awesome and so were the waitresses."}
{"text":"The burgers are to die for! They are cooked perfectly to order and the toppings and sauces are amazing! Our server Josh was awesome and definitely make our experience better.. a friend of mine got the impossible burger (their version of a veggie burger) and said it was the best he ever had. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Burger good even though I requested well done it was pink in the middle. Onion rings cold sent back,fries were good. Not a first choice"}
{"text":"Rated up there with one of the best burgers I have ever had ! Not too mention the sweet potato tots were on point , make sure to get that wal sauce to dip in. Besides the food our service was top notch , some of the best service I have ever had. Rob and Victor were great and always checked in on me and made sure I enjoy every second I was there @ Walburgers . 

Must try !!"}
{"text":"First time at Wahlburgers and probably last. Not bad but nothing special about the burgers. Overpriced. Much better places to get burgers on the strip!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a fast food style burger spot. It's located in a great party of vegas so it's easy to get to. I had Donnies favorite which was tasty. I liked the sliced green pepper on it that gives it some flavor and crunch."}
{"text":"Other than the wait this place was amazing.  Food the staff very accommodating to my party of twelve."}
{"text":"Really good food and good service.   a photographer goes around and takes a complementary photo for post card.
  a little while later they give you the postcard but also want to sell photos.   I bought 2 of them.

try them out!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many things about Wahlburgers, I finally decided to give it a try. Don't believe the hype. I ordered my 1/2 pound OTD burger medium and it came out gray throughout - definitely not medium. The flavors were average and nothing special. The mac and cheese with bacon was also subpar. The bacon was on top and was so hard, it was borderline inedible. Upon leaving, there were two hostesses at the front - neither said thank you or come again. Overall, a very disappointing and subpar experience. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I'm shocked there are so many 4-5 star reviews for this place. It's good, but it isn't Gordon Ramsay Burgr good. However, for the price this place is decent. I was excited to try this place because I'd heard so many great things about it. But, I didn't want to go right away because I knew it would be busy and the restaurant needed some time to get a seasoned staff in place. 

This is a new location located in the Bazaar plaza outside of Bally's. It's a bit of walk to get to from the parking garage, but it was nice to explore the casino since I hadn't been there in so long! The restaurant was packed when we got there on a Thursday night. It was a 15-20 minute wait so we walked around. 

FOOD: Once we were seated, we ordered the Mom's Sloppy Joe and The Our Burger. The burger was good. It's a simple one with 1/3 lb of meat with lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese with Wahl sauce and pickles on the side. The burger itself is good, but I prefer adding the Wahl sauce in it! The meat was tender and juicy. I think I should've gotten a larger burger so the meat to bread ratio would've been better. 

The Mom's Sloppy Joe was okay. I think the food may have been waiting at the window too long because by the time we got it the bread was a little mushy. It's an open-faced sandwich so you can't really eat it with your hands, you'll need a fork. The Sloppy Joe tasted good with the crispy onions. However, I didn't eat it with the bread since it was so mushy. I think had it came out right when it was made, then that the dish would've been good. 

PRICE for each was about $11-$13. So the meal with one drink was about $30 with tip. 

SERVICE was decent for how busy it was. I recommend not coming here during peak hours. Expect to wait if you come on the weekends. 

Overall, the meal was good. I wouldn't come back though. I think I would rather go to Shake Shack instead at New York New York. 

Happy Dining, 
J Tran"}
{"text":"The burgers we tried here were awesome! 

Funny, we'd been joking with our friend about going to Wahlburgers & she was super excited, so we laughed when telling her the bad news that they were all on the East Coast.  Well, joke was on us because we walked past the sign & realized that there WAS a location in Vegas, haha.  

So even though we weren't hungry yet, we stopped in & ordered 2 burgers/ 2 fries to share.  

Everything tasted GOOD!  Service was on point & dipping sauces weren't sneaky upcharges, haha!  (Unlike other places we tried in Vegas). 

Meals are conveniently served in disposable containers/ cups, so when we left, we were able to take our drinks. 

Would definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the TV show, Wahlburgers, so I was looking forward to trying the food here but I have to say I was disappointed.

I ordered the O. F. D. (Originally from Dorcester) burger and the Onion Strings. First of all, it took almost 15 minutes to prepare my order, with only two people ahead of me. Although the burger tasted good, it wasn't even hot enough to melt the cheese. The Onion Rings (strings) were very enjoyable. They had a nice crispy texture.

Overall, nice place, slow service, decent tasting food, but I've had better, much better, for less money."}
{"text":"The joint: Holy Crap!! We went to eat a late night bite,around MIDNIGHT (they close at 4AM), and it was still packed to the walls with people. Then again, it's Vegas and I cant complain because I'm the type to start drinking the minute I open my eyes in the AM (while on vacation only, of course!!!). The light fixtures are cool. Each one has a list of the movies, boybands, shows and family members. 

The food: My husband ordered the BBQ Bacon (Donnie's fave) w/jalapenos on the side.  I ordered the \"O.F.D\" with blue cheese. I had a FOODGASM (not a fake one either).  The meat was fresh, the bun wasn't soggy, and the blue cheese was on OVERLOAD.. Pure Perfection.

The Service:  It was pretty prompt. The only \"eh\" I have was that 1, we were seated in the back, closest to what I am assuming is the part of the kitchen. The garbage passed by our table a few times. Not a good aroma when you're eating blue cheese. #NoBueno
Oh, and 2, our server just gave us water. Not \"can I get you anything to drink?\" It was just \"here, you need water\", as if he knew that we had been in a drunken stupor just hours prior to coming here. LOL

Verdict: WE WILL BE BACK. The ambiance was fun, and everyone was upbeat. The food was delicious (and I dont even like to eat burgers in a restaurant). The only thing that would've been better wouldve been to have Paul  make the food himself. LOL (Or a glimps of Donnie or/and Mark) lol. #WishfulThinking 
 
Buen Provecho"}
{"text":"Too bad Mark wasn't there! Lol but seriously the waitress was awesome and our food was incredible. Worth every penny I had the bacon and swiss burger which was delicious and the root beer is by the bottle. They have sweet potato tater tots!!!!! Doesn't get better than that. And regular tater tots! My favorite burger place in town! U must visit, keep in mind the building is small but serves nicely and all their cups are take home souvenir cups with free refills!"}
{"text":"Fun place to grab lunch. Good staff. We had the melt, 2 hotdogs and a smahlburger. Very good beefy taste on the burgers and fries and taters are crispy perfect but pass on the hotdogs."}
{"text":"While I would go back I will also say that the food was ok.  But it would be better if it was hot for more than 2 minutes.  We sat at the bar that happened to have a blower that was blowing air straight down on the bar where we were sitting.  We asked to turn it off and were told no.
By the time we got the food it was sat on the bar directly under the blower and was completely cold in 2 maybe 3 minutes.  This is the entirety of my reasoning for the 1 star rating.  May have been good if we had gotten to have the food while it was still hot."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had. Wasn't expecting much. I had the The Melt and it was fabulous. It is a burger on Texas toast full of flavor. We also had The Our Burger and it was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Buns were grease and the lime stars were good. I will be back many times."}
{"text":"This location must be poorly managed.  Not only was the service horrible, the food was nothing great either.

When you think of a burger joint, you think about devouring plump, juicy burgers just like the ones you remember from your childhood. Not here!

First of all, there was no option to have the burger cooked med, well, or well done.....I know it's not a gourmet burger restaurant but that is standard. The burger came out overcooked and dry! 

Secondly the place had only one waitress to the whole restaurant. She was stressed and took it out on my party of 4 who wanted to grab a bite in between connecting flights. She had a very bad attitude. Through my whole meal she did not even ask my husband and I if we wanted anything to drink. She ended up changing her attitude and apologizing at the end of the meal but.....it was just not an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The burgers here are great loved this place the only compliant is that the staff seem a little confused, my wife and I had 3 different people come to us as if we have not ordered and just sat down. But over all great place to eat for burgers."}
{"text":"It was a toss up between and 3 and 4, 4 just because the food was not bad. It was a good hamburger, just not a great one. Maybe I was expecting more, if I want a great burger I will go to Gordon Ramsey burger over at planet Hollywood. Service was good, food was burger joint food"}
{"text":"The burgers were ok, not awesome. The sides were hit and miss. Tater tots were a hit the onion rings were a miss. The mac & cheese was a hit. The service was a miss. Very poor service . I'd probably go back to try something different. The atmosphere was very noisy and tables were very close together."}
{"text":"So growing up in the 90s I totally loved new kids on the block specially Donnie Wahlberg so when Wahlburgers opened you know I definitely have to check it out. They were supposed open earlier in Vegas but I guess it got delayed so it finally opened last year and I just got a chance to check it out a couple weeks ago. Watching them on TV got me so excited to try all the food they have there and to see exactly how the restaurant was. so  as I was saying I was totally hyped about getting here. Now my five stars that I listed is strictly for the food and not the customer service that's another story. But first  let's talk about the food. Sweet potato tots definitely a must if you go there I would totally love that I have the Jenny chicken burger which was so delicious I love the thin sliced onion rings they had something different than what you usually see at a burger joint we also had their government cheese sandwich which was also a good mother mixed drinks was OK it was kind of pricey $14 for one drink but oh well it was our first time there so we got that to him again food was excellent I would love to try their mac & cheese when I go back to Vegas again. I so wish they would open one here in Hawaii that would be awesome. I like the layout of the restaurant though from the outside it looked like it was a two-story building but it wasn't. I was very surprised that they didn't sell like their merchandise in the restaurant you actually have to go outside to another chaos and buy all the merchandise. When I've been to brand but it was really cold when we're in Vegas like 30° cold. Now let's talk about the customer service which was horrible and disappointing. Again from watching a show and reading some reviews it seem like it was a great place great atmosphere but our server John only came to our table to set us and to give us our drinks and then we didn't see him again until he came back to the table to give us our bill which I thought was odd. There are other servers that did bring out our food but it wasn't like they're excited to be there anything there was no Like  how's it going how's the food nothing they just drop the food and left and I can understand if it was busy but we were there at like 130 in the morning so it wasn't too busy. No one came to check on us if we needed more water or anything it was just really weird. I noticed that the employees would much rather stand to talk story with each other instead of making sure that the customers were OK. I also did inform John our server that it was our first time there and that we were excited and that we did come only from Hawaii but obviously that didn't make any difference to his level of customer service I was going to give us which is zero. There's anything that could be changed here I would say would be to train the staff better and interacting with customers. Again my five star rating is just strictly on the food and that's it if I had to read the customer service I will probably give them negative stars. But if you're in Vegas and you want to have a good burger definitely check out wall burgers they have a great selection of burgers and also some other dishes and some great makes drinks. I hope our next visit out there is better especially since were flying all the way from Hawaii to experience the wall burgers. And I just like to say that I did journey out to the kiosk outside on the strip and I bought items there to bring back to Hawaii for my friends and the gentleman working in that kiosk Francisco he was awesome he did great customer service gave me a free Blinky cup with some kind of strawberry slush in it once I told him I was from Hawaii and I was like one of their biggest fans like I said excellent customer service I would definitely go back. They need to have more Francisco's working in whalburgers just my opinion."}
{"text":"My dad watched his salad sit ready to be served for 10min. My mom and sister could barely finish their burgers they weren't flavorful at all. They ate their burgers with a nice small half filled cup with cold fries. My Mac and cheese ether had grease or some weird juice at the bottom of the cup. My whole family left feeling ill and had food poisoning. We were so excited to try it and no way we are going back."}
{"text":"Friggin delicious. Open until 4 am. Thank you Wahlburgers. Food is fast, hot, and tasty. Straight forward burger and fries. 
Best drunk food ever. $8 kids order was enough for an adult. Great portions. Friendly staff. Super happy I stopped here."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved their burgers. Their tater tots were extra crispy and came out pretty quickly. The servers were confused the entire time. We only ordered three things but had three different waiters help up. They seemed a bit unorganized with their sections on who to serve and what goes where. I would go again but it would be a To go order."}
{"text":"Had a delayed flight so time to kill for dinner, instead of Tims decided to try Walhburgers.   

I felt like wanting to order was intruding on the bar staffs personal space as I had to ask for menu, than ask to order after 20 minutes passed and every employee avoided eye contact, than when the runner brought my food out the bartender actually took it away from me saying it was the wrong food.  I never bring this card out and I hate it but it seemed to me that there was a 2 tiered level of friendliness with the staff depending on ones ancestry, just saying.  I travel a lot so notice when things seem \"unbalanced\".  Ordered a bacon burger and onion rings , the burger was ok but pretty greasy even for a burger and the onion rings were the shredded thin type, not my style.   So a negative for me, especially feeling like a lower class citizen.   Again I hate saying these things and maybe the staff was having a rough night or still early jitters. and it is not something I actively look for but I do really notice when it happens. 

On another note that has no bearing on my review,  they really have to improve the ventilation system as I was able to smell the grease the moment I came down the escalator after U.S. Immigration which is pretty far from Wahlburgers.  The smell does permeate throughout the terminal."}
{"text":"When we got to Wahlburgers, the place was packed, no seats available.
The hostess was polite and friendly and we were advised by text how long the wait would be and when our table was ready.
The wait wasn't too long, about 11 minutes.
The burger wasn't the biggest, but it was very flavourful and served quickly.
I LOVED the poutine, and trust me, I know poutine.
My gf had the tater tots and she devoured them, so they must have been good.
Service wasn't the best, but what can you expect at a burger joint.
I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Good burger (Our Burger), better than I expected.  Very good light bun and good beef.

The restaurant was very busy on a Saturday afternoon, which made the service very slow.

I would go back and try a different burger."}
{"text":"Donnie's Fave came out with some guacamole on the bottom bun, underneath the jalapeños, that you couldn't tell was there. Based on the photo, it shows actual slices of avocado, however the bar keep went and brought out more guacamole no questions asked. The other item was sweet potato tots and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Very good burger, but the price is high $10.00 for a burger and it doesn't come with anything. I
Liked the soda cups that you get to keep. Overall, five guys is cheaper and just as good."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try a wahlburger given all the hype. I got the regular house burger, which I think is usually a good yardstick for a Burger place. It comes with house sauce, tomato, lettuce, pickles, onions, cheese and 1/2 lb patty. I like how they shared the lettuce so you're not biting into a giant watery leaf, and the american cheese (they call it government cheese) melted pretty well on the patty.

But I think those were the best parts (not promising right?) The burger was overcooked so the inside was brown. Maybe a good idea at an airport since you never want passengers to be sick lol, but not my idea of a good burger that costs over 10 bucks. The bread is so bad. It was dry, airy and tasted like paper.

Well, at least now I can say I tried a wahlburger."}
{"text":"I ordered the classic burger - I found it expensive at around $10.00 with no sides included.  It tasted quite bad - dry bread, greasy on the outside, dry burger and the special sauce was not tasty either.  Definitely not worth the money - I was also disappointed by the tiny portion size.  I cannot recommend this place - there are better burger joints around."}
{"text":"Double decker burger and fries were good. The \"government\" cheese tasted just like I remember. The burger was cooked medium well and was perfect. The ambiance was comfortable. Wasn't too crowded. Might feel stuffy with more people. The waitress was new and could't get our orders right. Watch your receipt."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. I ordered a burger (the fries are separate) and it was nothing special. I ordered it well done and I am glad that it was still pretty thick and not dry. That's the best part of my meal. For a side we got the onion rings which I didn't like very much they were cut up into tiny slices and didn't have much flavor or anything and because of the size and shape hard to dip into ranch, which I thought would add more flavor to them. So basically for 2 burgers, one side of fries and a side of onion rings our bill was just a few dollars from $40 (we had a water for our drink). Neither my boyfriend or I would go back and we don't recommend it to our friends. In the end it's a fast food regular burger with sit down prices."}
{"text":"Not my type of burger.  This had been highly recommended, so thought I should try it.  Decided on the \"Our Burger\" which I imagined was their signature burger with special sauce.  Veggies dominated the taste with, I think a cucumber pickle instead of a dill.  The special suace seemed to be missing or wasn't that special.  Actually, the bun was the best part of the meal as it is sweet and soft.  Fries are seperate and sodas were $4.
The decor is non-descript along with the bar altough part of the bar is outside which could be nice if the weather were."}
{"text":"I got excited seeing one of these in the airport so naturally had to try it. I picked up a double burger, fries, and pasta salad today before my flight. The burger was horrible! The bun was hard, burgers were more round than patties, and the onions were huge (poorly sliced). The pasta salad was inedible as the pasta was undercooked. Too bad because the flavor was actually not too bad. They did nail the fries (that's why I have them a star, plus I can't go lower). 

Overall, unless I only want fries, I would not go back. I was definitely disappointed and kick myself for getting excited and not reading the Yelp reviews on this one. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese bad chicken sandwhich ok. Really expected more. Prices are a little high for poor quality"}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star and that's for the service alone. The burger quality is that of a little league baseball park. Patty had no flavor and looked like a pre made frozen patty. For 12.99 (burger only mind you, fries are 5$ extra) go to In & Out.... Not to mention the 1 hr wait to get in."}
{"text":"Had their melt. Ordered med, it comes pretty rare. Both sides of the burger are seared, but the meat is still blood red. I asked if this was medium, was told No. So sent back for a re-fire. Second melt came back cooked the same way. Was told then, this was medium. I've eaten enough to know medium from med-rare. When the texture of the meat is still uncooked, it's not medium. The fries are pretty bland. Overall, just another food place. The prices in their Vegas store are outrageous. Melt, fries and soda, $ 25.00, single person. Far ahead of Vegas strip prices."}
{"text":"wow...just, WOW. and not in a good way!!

i guess since you can't do no-star or negative-star reviews, i'm just going to refer this ONE star to the waitress/server that we had. because she was actually really really cool, and truth be told i felt bad for the girl. because no one that nice should have to deal with the VERY OBVIOUS bullsh-t going on at this place.

my gentleman friend and i stopped in to try this place while we were in vegas for my last weekend here. (i'm originally from massachusetts and i like everything about the wahlburgs'...at least, as much as an average person like myself should know based on mark and donny's acting in movies etc. im not a rabid fan, but theyve done some good work)

...so i'm also not wanting the douche-baggery that we witnessed to be a reflection on them. but they should know whats up. 
 
the \"kitchen manager\" at the vegas strip location, could use a few lessons. the least of which being in the following categories:

1) having and using decorum, in general
2) the service industry, in general
3) how to NOT behave like an unprofessional, attitude-having, no-manners jackass...in general 

because that there fella clearly needs some help. 

when a customer orders the \"double-dog\", and just wants 2 plain dogs, with nothing on them...you'd think that's a pretty simple thing to NOT mess up. 

one \"dad's\" burger, cooked medium, plain, and the \"double-dog\", PLAIN. yes, plain. there is nothing difficult about that. 

especially when your cool server goes out of her way to verify \"nothing?...just 2 plain hot dogs?\" and you say \"yes\", and everyone's happy and folksy and things are going just as they should.....until some other waitstaff brings your order and the 2 hot dogs have EVERY FREAKING CONDIMENT slopped on them. 

gentleman friend and i kind of exchanged looks, like...youre kidding, right? had to be the wrong table. nope there are your \"plain\" dogs. 

okay....so no big deal, whatever, they go back. 

and a wrong order, courtesy of the a-hole managing the kitchen, turns into a freaking debacle of jackassery, the likes of which i just could. not. believe.

he--from the kitchen, in plain view of us--VISIBLY denied getting the order wrong, gave both the innocent girl who just brought the order to our table AND our server (who took the order), a rash of sh*t, made it so beyond painfully obvious he was INSISTING that \"we\" had ordered it the way it was served, and then took his sweet a$$ time, correcting the order. 

and clearly, with a grudge...as one of the two plain hot dogs that were eventually brought to the table WASNT EVEN F-CKING COOKED!!! one was obviously grilled/cooked. the other one, cold and weirdly grayish-brown.

honest to cripes, i was just looking at it like.....no. 
there is NO f-cking way this just happened. but it soooo did. i was shaking my head not knowing if it was really funny or more than mildly psychotic.  i still dont know. 

what i do know is this:

if your job is managing the kitchen in a restaurant on the STRIP OF LAS VEGAS, and cant even muster an above-junior-high-school level of maturity...forget professionalism at all or just behaving like a capable, balanced person...you need to be f-cking fired. 

just straight fired. find something else, which doesn't involve human interaction. 

\"kitchen manager's\" display was just so beyond inappropriate, that by the time our poor beleaguered server told us it had been taken off our total, i was just relieved that there wouldnt be a further scene. 

we just thanked her for being cool, left a good tip, wished her a good night and got the hell out of there. 

take it off our check, thanks. 

that definitely makes up for you acting like a blatant jackass in front of your staff and customers. what a sack of sh-t. the burger was kind of gross, too. ordered it medium, came back practically mooing and just tasting bad.

i decided to not further test the patience of that behavioral-issue-plagued mental case and thought to myself leave it alone... i couldnt even imagine what would have come back. 

$25 for a sh*tty burger and an obnoxious display. i left there cursing my own self for even suggesting we try the place and wishing we had just gone to mcdonalds instead."}
{"text":"I love Donnie and I watch the show. Always wanted to try this place, but I didn't have high expectations. I thought it was a grab and go place, but it's actually a sit down place with service. I got the our burger and tater tots. The sauce is good and they do know how to make a good burger. Affordable and crispy tots/fries. Will come back to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for what you get. Their vegan impossible burger comes with dairy cheese which kind of defeats the purpose. Make sure to tell them to remove it and no butter /mayo spread. About $20-25 for a simple vegan burger that lacks substance."}
{"text":"Amazing food and fast, good service! Can't wait to go back.
Sweet potato tots were delish"}
{"text":"Good food, had the crispy haddock sandwich and it was fantastic. Great options for vegetarians too."}
{"text":"It was time to give this place another shot, which I did on Sat 3/10/2018.  
We got there at around 3:30 pm and it was pretty busy in the dining area, so we decided to add our name/number to the waiting list.  About 5-10 mins later a table opened up in the bar area, so we went and sat in there.  

Immediately, someone came over to wipe down the high top table for us.  Shortly after that the manager came over and gave us menus and asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  So far, so good!

Then our waitress came over with silverware and napkins and talked with us for a bit.  She was fantastic!!  We started with the Sweet Potato Tots and Thin Crispy Onion Rings, which were both fantastic and highly recommended.  

Next, I ordered the \"Our Burger\" and my counter part ordered the \"Triple Decker\", both with white cheddar cheese and a side of Crispy Yukon French Fries.  They were both cooked the way we wanted and were so very good!!  

This was a total 180 from the 1st time I was here.  I definitely recommend you stop there and I know I'll be back....THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burgers that come with quite the price tag! These burgers lack the juiciness in the patty that I'm looking for and is very messy to eat! I get that it's finger food the proportion of sauce just isn't right.

The fries with the wahl sauce (or whatever it's called) was meh. The fries were not fresh and lack that crisp I was looking for.  

This place is gimmicky and people come here because of the Mark wahlburg name. If I had the option to come back here again, I probably wouldn't and rather go to Holy Chuck or something."}
{"text":"Melle Mel and the Funky Bunch in da house!!  Eat big to get big!!  Pain and Gain!!  

Wahlburgers is the new kid on the block when it comes to burgers in Las Vegas.  Unlike other Yelpers or The Other Guys that tried this place, I thought that my burger was pretty good. I didn't order straight from the menu because nothing really appealed to me.  I had this Sixth Sense that I wasn't going to be impressed.  So, I opted to build my own burger, which consisted of a 1/2 lb burger patty, one 5 oz grilled chicken breast, and a fried egg.  Yes, I did.  This is The Happening. This burger was huge and big enough to feed a King, maybe even Three Kings.  Taste wise, I was not disappointed.  The chicken was tender, the meat was flavorful not greasy, and the egg gave it that Midas touch.  Combining all three of my favorite protein sources together made for a Perfect Storm.  Although I enjoyed my burger, the food at Wahlburgers is not Invincible.  I also tried their Bacon Mac N' Cheese and the Tater Tots.  The bacon mac was just okay and the tater tots needed a little more work in the deep fryer. We obviously didn't finish the tots and left a couple of Lone Survivors.  Terri R. and Ty W. got their standard 1/3 lb burger while Lore D. got a delicious looking patty melt.  I could tell that everyone in our group was satisfied with their burgers.  I could feel the Good Vibrations. 

The wait can be an issue, especially since Wahlburgers is located off the strip. We waited outside for close to 30 minutes for our table in 110 degree weather.  I wish that the restaurant had a Transformer outside so that they could at least plug in a cool zone for us.  Yes, it was hot and seemed even warmer inside because the restaurant is one big green house.  Price is one of the biggest drawbacks.  The cost for a burger is around $8 and my creation was over $12. 

Besides the wait and the prices, the service was great.  Our server was very attentive and Management even checked on us a few times.  Free Refills?  Yes!  Free stickers for the younglings? Double Yes!!  We decided against dessert and Departed after we paid our bill.  

Bottom Line...I originally came here expecting the worse, but left satisfied with both the burgers and the service. Peace!!!


2016 Yelp Review #42"}
{"text":"It was very good. Though it was gonna be regular burger like other place. My buddy got the burger I had a bite it was yummy. I got the mom sloppy joe. It was very tasty. Only reason why I am giving it a 4 start was for the ranch. It was different. Not something for me but maybe other ppl may like it."}
{"text":"Had to send the tiny bowl of fries back 4 times!! Cold cold cold.  The onion strings were cold,  the burger buns were cold...the onion strings were delicious when they came back hot....the ketchup is off brand,  the hot dogs were scrawny with little to no toppings..had to send the waitress back 2 times for saurkraut because they were only allowed to give tiny cups of it. Absolute waste of money.  Talked with the manager,  he agreed that the hot dogs at 7-11 are better....really???? Where is Paul?????"}
{"text":"This review is for their fast food meal route (towards the back of the restaurant). So here's the thing - we came here around 9:40 PM on a Wednesday evening right after a Blue Jays game over the summer (it's about a 5 minute walk from the Rogers Centre, and also within walking distance from the entertainment district). The place wasn't busy, there was no lineup (yet), and our stomachs were begging for sustenance. Because they weren't busy, we received our order right away, piping hot, crispy, and fresh (I ordered onion rings ($3.50) and their Signature 'Our Burger' (around $9.50)). We grabbed a clean table and actually really enjoyed our meal. 

The verdict? Pretty good! It isn't the best burger I've ever had, but it wasn't terrible either. I can understand the bad reviews below - our visit time occurred during off-peak, weeknight hours, where they could potentially put more effort into making our food. Regardless, the burger was hot and fresh, and the onion rings were super unique and different from anything we've had before - super, extremely thin, very crispy, and seasoned quite well (think of Hickory Sticks as onion rings, and that's pretty much what it is).

Prices were average to high for a gourmet burger joint. I paid around $17.00 for my burger and onion rings (no drink)."}
{"text":"Can I get some grease with a side of burger? I was so excited to try Wahlburgers and I was pretty disappointed. The burger was very greasy and average. Not something I would come back to. I'm local so if I come to the strip for a burger this is not somewhere I want to go. Tots were good. Got the melt with a regular Bun rather than the thick bread and it was also average. The onion rings are onion strings with light breading. I'm hoping we just got a bad batch but they weren't crunchy at all. My favorite part was the homemade pickles! The staff was very nice and on top of things."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here cause I've heard that it was opening up in Vegas and I finally came in today a little disappointed at the price that it's $11 for a burger and you don't get fries and if you want fries it's an extra five bucks and it's a small portion of french fries i'll be honest with you they weren't that great

I'm sad because I wanted to leave this place five stars because I absolutely love Mark Wahlberg and that's why came here but it's definitely just an average burger place with loud music that's overpriced two burgers fries and a shake $38.75

And by the way they should be called onion strings not onion rings and I had to send those back if they were cold

Our server Tyler was nice and the place was very accommodating of my service animal maybe I'll give it one more shot who knows"}
{"text":"5/6/2017

The chicken burger was AMAZING, a great early lunch! but the service is the worst I have received in a long time.


No greeting for 5 minutes even though the bartender was right in front of us

The servers complained about their Manager the whole time, how much they hated their shifts and other negative topics (talking loud for everyone at the bar to hear), they called the other servers liars and griped the whole time. VERY unprofessional and distracting.

They also brought someone else's order plopped the food down only to pick it up again, without one word. Not a 'sorry about that' or anything

The food was really good, loved the onion rings and my chicken burger, the service and attitude of the staff killed it, I will have to go to the downtown location instead"}
{"text":"This Wahlbugers' has been open for 3 weeks and the food was really good. The \"Our Burger\" was cooked as ordered and everything tasted fresh. The onion rings were hot and not greasy. I would come back again!"}
{"text":"I'm a burger fanatic but this joint is just okay. It's loud, crowded and overpriced, and the food is just so/so. When you eat here, you're paying for the novelty of the name and owners. (Now, if they decide to have Mark and Donny start serving burgers shirtless, I may reconsider my star rating)!

I was surprised at how difficult it was to find the restaurant, it's AT Bally's but it's not IN Bally's -- you have to go outside and down several escalators to get there. Once you arrive, expect a wait. The restaurant thankfully has a system where you can give them your cell number and they'll text you when your table is ready. It's nice enough, but there's nothing to do around the area while you wait, just some lame shops and the casino. 

While I appreciated the gimmick of \"government cheese,\" I really hate fake cheese so that just grossed me out. I was happy they had Swiss cheese too, but I think it may have been Swiss-flavored processed cheese food. 

The fried onions were mediocre (they were red onions too, which meant they were far too pungent for the light batter). I ordered a triple cheeseburger because I was starving, and I'm glad I did because the portion size was really small for the price. My burger was cooked as ordered and well seasoned. The pickle chips were INCREDIBLY delicious, but the chili was the absolute star of the meal. Yes, the chili has beans (boo!), but they are minimal.

It was fun to try once, but I probably won't go back to this place."}
{"text":"The servers should be a bit more tentative, but the food was great! I got the BBQ burger with onion rings instead of fries. I recommend trying their special house sauce . The onion rings are not that great I'd suggest going with fries instead."}
{"text":"I am only giving one star because they don't give the option for no stars. I was extremely disappointed in my experience here. I live in Detroit and frequent the location in Greektown. The people are always so nice and attentive and prompt. This is the same behavior I expected while in Toronto but I didn't receive that. We were staying in the adjoining hotel, The Soho Metropolitan for my birthday which is July 6th. My boyfriend went to the location on July 5th and arrived at 9:54pm. He asked the hostess, who was actually really nice, if they were closed and could he order food. Her response was absolutely. He said okay, and proceeded to the line to order food. The person taking the order asked was it for here or to go, his response was \"here\". The cashier looks at him and says, \"You do realize we close in 5 minutes?\" My boyfriend responds, \"I just asked the girl at the door if it was okay to order food and she said yes.\" The girl responds, \"Well we aren't allowed to tell you that you can't come in if it's before we close.\" He says okay and proceeds to order the food. He orders two sandwiches and two orders of fries both with the pickles on the side. When they called him, we noticed the food in a bag. I said, \"Oh you ordered it to go?\" He says no. He walks over the girl gives him a weird look when he said I thought I told u for here. While we were figuring out what sandwich goes to who he realized there was only one side of pickles. He goes back and says can I have another side of pickles. She asks for the pickles and the cook in back yells, \"Kitchen's closed.\" Now, my boyfriend owns a bar, ironically, a burger bar. So he knows how things should be handled in this situation, so he gets upset. He says to the cook, \"Well had you done it right the first time I wouldn't have to come back and ask for anything.\" The cook says something that I couldn't hear and my boyfriend says, \"I can't believe how rude you people are.\" There were two ladies sitting in a booth near the counter and kitchen and one speaks up. My boyfriend asks if she is management. She asks what's the problem, he asks again if she is management and she respond yes. He says, \"Your employees are rude. If they didn't want to serve us they should have said that when I arrived and asked about ordering. They didn't give me my order correct. I ordered it for here, they give it to me in bags, and now your cook is yelling from the back of the house. It's extremely rude.\" She responds, \"Well sir, the cooks are rude to us too.\" He said, \"Well you need to fire them. I own a bar and this behavior would never be tolerated.\" He then tells me we can go eat elsewhere after I apologized for suggesting we go in the first place. We left without even touching the food. He tells the manager have a nice night and we leave. We paid $35.31 for a meal we couldn't even enjoy, $20 of it was in USD, which makes it actually $41.07 paid. Its super upsetting that while on vacation for my birthday, going to a place I usually love to go to, this happens. I definitely have no desire to return."}
{"text":"The service fast once we sat down our server Bill was all over drinks, they came out FAST and the burgers even faster once we order them. I will come back and try something different next time, Wahlburg brothers good job on the food and making a great family business. Bill is an excellent waiter as the business and food reflected the quality of this establishment."}
{"text":"We had some time to kill before a flight and there was a Wahlburgers right by our gate, so this was a no brainer.

I went with the Thanksgiving Day burger (Fresh ground seasoned turkey, stuffing, Paul's orange cranberry sauce, roasted butternut squash & mayonaise). It arrived shortly after and I dug in.

If you were somehow able to take air and turn it into a burger, it would taste a lot like this. The turkey and the stuffing were prominent here and they were both insanely tasteless. The cranberry sauce was pure sweetness and it had somehow been shoved all the way over to one side, so it didn't help. Honestly this was the blandest, most tasteless dish I've eaten in a long time.

I also got the onion rings (crispy fried bermuda onion sliced thin, tossed in sea salt & parsley). I like the concept behind this side - they're nothing like any other onion ring you've ever eaten - but these also were foiled by an internee tastelessness that made it seem like I was eating deep-fried air.

(Why this hatred of spices and salt, Wahlbergs?)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, prices are a bit much compared to their other Non Las Vegas  locations, price of one burger you can get a full meal at their other locations. Oh well, still a good burger, but won't be a go to spot for breaks."}
{"text":"The burger is amazing I wanted the full experience, so I ordered a lot Mac n cheese a must have, chili soooo goood!!! Sweet potato tots yummy,  onion rings bomb and French fries with my burger!!!   The only thing I would say is the wait for service and for the food to arrive was a bit of a wait...my thought was maybe someone called in sick because it felt short staffed!i"}
{"text":"Came by here during my first visit to Las Vegas as this was the first burger place I saw when I entered on on the strip. I knew about Wahlburgers due to the celebrity connection and ownership by the Wahlberg brothers (Mark and Donnie) so I thought I would give it a try just like I gave Transformers: Age of Extinction a try (Starring Mark Wahlberg).  

The menu consists of traditional American food items like sandwiches, burgers, fries, tater tots, and even a few salad options for you vegans out there who also enjoy the cinematic/musical works of The Wahlberg brothers.  This location also has a bar and patio area. Staff were courteous, attentive, and provided a fun atmosphere.  Just to confirm, none of the employees are dressed in costumes based off Mark Wahlberg's cinematic characters  as I hoped there would be.  Just imagine a server dressed as Dirk Diggler.  But no, this is not a theme restaurant as I hoped but that's fine.  All the staff members wore a signature black t-shirt and pants combo similar to the fashion of Starbucks' employees.  

I had the \"Our Burger\" with a side of crispy tater tots (as recommended by Paul Wahlberg's note on the menu, who is also the actual chef of the family).  It was absolutely delicious in every way.  It was surprisingly so good that I laid back in the dining booth for a moment holding my stomach just like Bruce Willis did after he got shot by Donnie Wahlberg's creepy character in The Sixth Sense.

I highly recommend this place.  I'm going to go watch their A & E show now."}
{"text":"First off the service was terrible. I ordered a black and white frappe and some how they blended a plastic spoon into it. The waiter ended comping the frappe. Then, our food came out and the order was not compete. We were four sides short (two orders of sweet potatoes, regular fries, and onion rings). The manager Julio ended up taking off 20% from the check. So, the food was actually pretty good. I ordered the beast. Bacon bbq burger could use some more sauce. The homemade ranch tasted terrible. This restaurant seems more of novelty. My wife is a huge fan of the show. I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here after work with a co-worker. We were very excited to try this place after hearing great things about it. I've heard about it in Detroit but never made it out to visit when I go there so having it come to Cleveland was very exciting!

We stopped in and it has a nice and simple atmosphere. Great energy. It has a nice location for people watching people on the intersection as well, right by the casino. Lots of life all around which is always a plus.

They have a nice menu with healthier options that I wasn't expecting such as salads and turkey burgers. My friend was on a diet so he was able to substitute a turkey burger for any on the menu. We both had the \"Our Burger\" which is the standard burger on the menu. I had it cooked medium-well. He ordered the sweet potato tots and I had the regular tots. 

Service was quick and efficient. The food was delicious. The burgers were perfect-sized as well. They weren't too big and not too small. It was the perfection portion. The tots were just okay, nothing to write home about but the burger is the star of the show. Very juicy and tender and the sauce is bangin' good!

I'll be back to try other menu items for sure but I'm glad the burger was top notch which is what this place is known for. Can't wait to come back and try it again."}
{"text":"I can see why this establishment is rated so poorly....

It took twenty minutes for our server to greet us. And this is after we flagged down a server/busier to find our server for us. The manager literally stands at the host stand and stares off into space, not scanning the floor to check the flow of the restaurant. 

Food is unimpressive.

Please help yourself and find another place to eat."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my fiance, we both ordered turkey burgers. The burgers were barely warm and they forgot cheese on one.  The onion rings were really good though."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night (Friday). We were seated right away as we came in later during the evening. The waitress was so nice and friendly. I had the Our Burger. It was delicious. There were three of us so we had 3 different sides: fries, tater tots, and crispy onion rings, all were tasty and fresh. I've read a lot of bad reviews but we have been meaning to try this place for a while and I'm sure we will be back I just hope we will see some consistency. For our first time it was excellent."}
{"text":"The service was abysmal.  The hostess who seated us seemed very annoyed that she was there working.  Once we were seated, it took 15 minutes to get a waitress to stop at our table, and she only came by because we flagged down the hostess and asked for our server to be sent over.  In the meantime, the table next to us - who were seated after us - had already been served water and placed their drink and food orders.  I ordered one of the specialty \"adult\" milkshakes, and I was brought what was obviously a cocktail, not a milkshake since it had no ice cream.  I told the server it was not the correct drink, and when she did bring me a milkshake, it did not resemble the item described on the menu at all.  It took about 45 minutes after we ordered to get our food, and although I ordered onion rings, I was given tater tots and told that there was \"something wrong with the oil\" and they could not make the onion rings.  Also, my burger was not hot.  We also heard the server for the table next to us tell them, about 30 minutes after they ordered, that he could not give them a hot dog because all the hot dogs were frozen.  Also, we were never given silverware or napkins and had to get up from the table to get napkins from another table.  Our waitress only came back once during an hour and 45 minute meal to ask about drink refills.  The only reason I gave this experience 2 stars is because my cold burger and substitute tater tots actually tasted good."}
{"text":"Four of us stopped in because there was no wait on a Saturday around 10PM, should have known why. Got a booth, got our water, ordered our food and drinks fairly quickly, good start, wouldn't last. It took some time to get our drinks, some time later food would arrive. We all ordered burgers, two with bacon. I usually hate the \"how was your food\" interruption that comes as I'm eating my first bite, but will never take that for granted again. Our waiter, all waiters seemed to disappear for at least 20 minutes. This wasn't good seeing that one of our group did not get bacon on the burger. We tried to slow eat, this didn't work as it took so long to get the staffs attention. The waiter took the burger back and 10 mins later the manager came back WITH THE SAME BURGER, we were all done eating, \"there's bacon on it\" he stated. I said show me, he pointed to a baconless bun (i had all our group look and no bacon could be found).  \"We'll make you another\", no thanks the experience is now ruined and everyone was done eating and we aren't waiting around for 20 more minutes for a replacement burger? The burgers were very average, nothing that I would have shared on social media if this didn't happen."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here-ordered onion rings but they are fried onions...I wouldn't call them rings more like something you would add to a burger. The macaroni is literally a macaroni salad not an entree!! And has no taste 
The burger was ok...nothing special.  This place is a waste"}
{"text":"Ate there 2 years ago ! Big fan of the Wahlburgs!!!
Very disappointing in service and especially the food did not live up to expectations would not recommend Wahlburgers !"}
{"text":"We thought we would check it out. The Patty Melt was basic and nothing special about the Yukon Gold fries. I'm not sure this place will be here very long. So many choices with much better food. Not sure why they use plastic utensils! You are not inside the airport! People prefer silverware!!!"}
{"text":"Awsome staff... this place hires very helpful and kind people.... they helped me make my friends day... i would recommend this place to my friends.. and return soon...  a very nice place...."}
{"text":"Only waited about 15 min to get seated and service was great. That's about it. 50 bucks for 2 burgers and a soda and a beer. But what do you expect it is on the strip. The burgers were ok nothing to get excited over. Will not make the trip just for their burgers."}
{"text":"Walked up to place our name on the list only to be told that there would be and hour and a half wait. We had traveled from San Diego waiting to make this one of our priorities while in Vegas but was little short on time. We decided to ask for a seat in the bar while we waited thinking we could have some fries and a shake or a beer while we waited. The gentleman at the door seated us right away and then found out that we could order off the full menu. The server we had was Basile. He was perfect and very polite! He made some great suggestions for us and the service was great! We sat down ordered our food and ate within an hour. When we left the guests that were placing their name on the list before us were still waiting.  I asked Basile to meet the Manager because I wanted to be sure to compliment the staff and exceptional service we received. Her name was Emma. She was extremely kind as well. We were able to keep the green plastic glasses that our drinks were served in. As a matter of fact, Basile swapped them our for new ones. I have some friends that live in Vegas which is why we try to get up there a couple of times a year and I can not wait to get back and share a meal there again. I asked them to let their friends know to check it out because the food was very fresh and cooked exactly how we expected it to taste.  Thank you very much Emma and Basile for the exceptional service and pleasant atmosphere!  We hope to see you again the next time we are up."}
{"text":"Went to Walburgers last night and really thought the food was great.  I had the patty melt and my friend had the cheeseburger with special sauce.  Service was much faster and everything was great. for sides we had the shoestring onions and French fries both were good large servings. I would definitely go back to try other things and hang out to people watch"}
{"text":"First time there & we live here. The best darn burger ever. We will go back & when family & friends come to visit we will definitely take them there. Service was fast & server so friendly."}
{"text":"For my first time, it was a pretty decent experience. Other than the pretty cold \"welcome\" (um, can I get someone to seat me?? Why are staff looking confused?) I enjoyed Wahlburgers. The waitress, Chole was mad cool and the food was delicious! I had the sloppy joe. It was very filling and I wish I would've saved some for lunch the next day. The sloppy joe is a bit sweet, so I love the pickles they give you on the side. Nice balance of taste. The only thing that would've made it better was an extra slice of bread. My daughter had the vegan sandwich. I think it's called the Impossible Burger or something. She loved it, especially with the special Wahlburger sauce. As a side we shared fries. For $3.50 or so a side, I wasn't buying two, but the one was enough for the both of us. We topped it all off with double chocolate cupcakes that we weren't able to eat since we were full. There are some other items I'd like to try, so I will be back! 

It was a clean establishment, the bathrooms were decent and we went on a Monday evening and it  wasn't busy. The overall service and experience, on a scale of 1-10, was a 8."}
{"text":"The burgers were extremely expensive for not that great tasting of a burger. The Mimosa I ordered was good but the customer service was not too great. The waiter was busy but didn't bring my drink until after the food because he forgot. I think the French fries were good but the ranch didn't taste like regular ranch. I think the restaurant was nice inside but the food and drinks shouldn't be expensive due to the quality."}
{"text":"The place was nice and clean but customer service needs improvement also burgers are nothing special. We were there on Thursday for lunch so not that busy to pricey for what you get or maybe my expectations were too high not sure but just disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here on 3/26/17 around 130. The hostess said 20 minutes and took our phone #. We sat out front and waited, and waited, and waited. Girlfriend goes to see what's taking so long. They said they already text and we didn't respond. Funny she was holding her phone the whole time waiting. Finally seated and waited another 15 minutes for the waiter. Split a double cheeseburger  (which was average) BUDS IN VALLEJO IS BETTER. Tator tots, root beer float, and Mac n cheese(very good). Took a while to get the check too. Felt like pulling a runner. Tried it because we watch the show. Kind of a let down."}
{"text":"Service was great and the bartender was extremely friendly. Stopped here when in town on business for a quick bite. I had never been to a Wahlburgers before and wanted to see what the hype was about. I ordered a basic hamburger with tots. The dipping sauce was really good. THe hamburger was on par with most hamburgers I've had at similiar places. Tasty and filling, but a hamburger."}
{"text":"The food was great. When I went it was pretty dead. Which was nice because the service was good(sat at bar). Would for sure come back. Also had the blueberry pie frappetini, super delicious and fun concept. It's like a boozy milkshake martini."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with great food. Fast and friendly servers. It is located just next door to Ballys and Paris. 

We took an Uber got dropped off at Ballys just a short walk away. Any of the Ballys staff can point you on the right direction. 

Take a seat at the bar and catch a game or relax in a comfy booth. Music playing keeps a cool vibe going. This place is usually pretty busy, but never had to wait long."}
{"text":"Wahlburgers Las Vegas 

Let me start by saying I'm a die hard Wahlberg fan. I grew up being a block head and I watch every Mark Wahlberg movie. Growing up, I may have stalked Donnie & Mark's family home in Braintree, Massachusetts when MTV was filming a show about them. 
My husband & I visited Wahlburgers Las Vegas on July 4, 2016 around 3:45 pm. The location is ideal - in the new Bazaar shops near Bally's. It's a really cute location with small shops and Wahlburgers is tucked away in the back. When we found our way, the gentleman at the door said it would be about a 45 minute wait and asked my husband for his cell phone number. They text us when the table was ready which was cool cuz we could continue gambling or shop in that little area. 
So, we get the text and show up about 2 minutes later and it was about 45 minutes we had to wait but when we got inside, there were a few tables open which was odd. The waiter comes over and we order waters. The ambiance is like the other location in Hingham, Ma so I've seen on TV. Lime green chairs and Wahlberg pictures on the walls and on the ceilings are the titles of movies Donnie & Mark have starred in. Cute!
The waiter takes our order - we split the bacon Mac n cheese and I got the  Thanksgiving Day Sandwich and the hubs got Jenn's chicken sandwich. The waiter asked \"what would you like for a side\"? We both got the tater tots. We didn't have to wait that long, plus I was taking a bunch of pictures and taking it all in. 
Initially, the bacon Mac n cheese didn't have the bacon or breadcrumbs on it but the waiter gave us a new cup - I assume he didn't just ask for bacon & breadcrumbs. 
My sandwich was good. A turkey burger with stuffing and butternut squash purée with a little bit of mayo. A bit dry. I would have liked a cranberry jam on it or maybe more mayo, but it was good. Jenn's chicken sandwich was ok also but the bun was too small for the chicken breast and the Caramelized onions made the bun excessively soggy. Also, it had shredded lettuce which I thought would be better suited not being shredded.  
The waiter came and asked if we had room for dessert. We didn't. We were full enough but not over full. The bill all together was $45.15. I was shocked that a lunch meal at a burger joint could be that expensive. 
All in all, I would give Wahlburgers Las Vegas a score of 6.5 if we were saying 1 was bad and 10 was great. The things I liked were the way they text you telling you your table was ready. Very 2016 and a great idea instead of handing out those huge beepers. I also felt like my teenage self again being all boy band crazy. The main thing I did not like was the waiter asking what side we wanted as it implied the side came with the meal. Had we known roughly 15 tater tots each would be $4.95, we would have split one or not gotten them at all. They are straight up tater tots - no special seasoning on them or anything. My advice to this particular location is to either lower the prices or be sure the customer knows they have to pay for their side. Had we been a larger group like a family of 4, the bill would be close to $100. For a turkey burger and chicken sandwich?! In all fairness, they had only been open 4-5 days. But if they'd like to stay open 4-5 months, I recommend decreasing their prices. Still love Donnie & Mark but will never eat there again...certainly not the \"right stuff\" for those over inflated prices."}
{"text":"My wife got just a regular hamburger.  It gave her a wicked bout of food poisoning and she has an iron stomach.

She is puking as we speak.  Have to wonder about about their quality control."}
{"text":"Burgers are okay not to great.  If you like liquid cheese sauce for your overpriced mac n cheese this is the place for you.  You are definitely paying for the name.  The value for what I paid was not good.  Its a nice restaurant and was clean tho."}
{"text":"The Food tastes good, but it came cold, service is horrible, with the prices I would have expected to at least get a warm burger. Yet again food tasted decent. But being in Vegas and close to so many other places I Would never recommend this place to anyone that I love."}
{"text":"Okay we really wanted to love this place because of the family!! but it wasn't the best experience!!! It was so hot outside we wanted a nice cool place to eat but not much cooler inside. The staff seemed to be disorganized they were having interviews at the table next to us and the guy folding whatever seems to be hovering right over our table. He should have done his work else where. I'm a fatty so I'm not a picky eater but I need my meat cooked well done!! They even asked and put a pretty little stick that said \"well done\". I did send back the first burger with hesitation. And the 2nd one was still pink. I give up and just eat the onions rings. They didn't charge us but not what we expected. My husbands burger was good. Maybe by next year they will get it right."}
{"text":"Aria was a wonderful waitress! The prices were great and so were the burgers! Crazy busy place at 10:30 pm."}
{"text":"First impressions speak volumes.   They failed massively.  They sat us in a table facing the sun with no shade, but begrudgingly moved us upon asking.  Then the first waiter said they had a seasonal list of beer,  then the bartender rudely dropped off beers.  The second waiter is what saved the day.  He explained what beers were on tap but not listed, he also was very friendly.  We will see what the food tastes like, it smells great."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service was also very SLOW coming out of the kitchen. So why the the 4 stars you ask? Good is good and they have fantastic gluten free burgers!"}
{"text":"What can I say. Damn good burger! Our waiter suggested his favorite with a twist, the \"our burger\". However, add a fried egg and avocado. But the best, and I mean best part was the dessert. Say it with me...grilled banana fluffanutta!! Sounds weird, but holy #$%@, just enjoy."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!!! If you're into pickles on your burger (hopefully everyone) you have to try how awesome they are! The signature wahl's sauce is incredible! Topped with bacon and avocado and lettuce the burger was just pure flavor for what this restaurant is. Which I feel is like half fast food/crafty so I loved It. The sweet potato fries and regular fries are a delight as well! The only thing was service was slow but who cares I'm here for the burgers It was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I stopped into Wahlburgers for the first time, and I thought that their grub was pretty tasty. Now, we are talking gourmet burger at the airport, so it's bound to a bit one the pricy side. However, it was right in the price point of Five Guys and other gourmet burger chains, so no great burger crime here. 

I had the house specialty (R Burger..I think) and a batch of Yukon Golden fries. The burger was very tasty, and the fries, dressed in Walhburgers' secret sauce, were gold strike of delicious proportions. I added a few Milk Stouts to my meal (Hey, I was in Canada after all .. Eh). 

The service was friendly and efficient, and I found myself wishing that we had a Walhburgers in the D.C. Area, for I dig their casual, burger atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came by here after having a disappointing meal inside the Bellagio. 
Before looking at the menu we asked our waiter what was good and just pointed out everything and game it thumbs up.
The one good thing is they have lots if sides you can add to your burgers but the burgers they offered had such odd ball combinations. Like bbq sauce and avocado spread or bbq and blue cheese and sriracha with mustard.  They also don't know to cook very well. We told them we wanted are burgers medium and still pink in the middle but came back well done. Fries were run of the mill bland. 
I recommend you somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great but..,, ask for Brendan and he will make you an AMAZING New York sour. Sorry pic is with some gone it wS so g"}
{"text":"I had the \"Our Burger\" and thought it was really good. I got caramelized onions instead of uncooked onions and that was a great substitution. The fries and tater tots were good too! I was excited to eat here since I watch the show. 
We were told that we were going to have a 30-45 minute wait, but were pleasantly surprised that it was only about a 15-20 minute wait. Overall great experience and will visit again if we are ever in a city that has one."}
{"text":"This place is always packed but if you want some good burgers and fries this is a place to go. The OUR Burger is really good (minus onions) and the Double decker burger is good if you have a big appetite. Fries are good but in my opinion could be a tad bit better (since they are homemade). Tater tots are SO GOOD when fresh and hot! Not a fan of the specialty cocktails I had, they were very sweet. But overall, I would definitely come back! Wouldn't mind running into Donnie or Mark either ;)"}
{"text":"Although, I love the Walhberg's, but I was so disappointed in their food, and burger choices. Let me just say it looked a little bit beat up inside, or maybe I expected more. 

My husband and cousins had the burgers and they said they were just o.k. Nothing to rave about. They did like their onion strings.  I went big and had a grilled cheese. It was just that a plain old grilled cheese, you can't mess up a grilled cheese.

The best part was taking pictures with the boys!!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place only has 3 stars, I went here and had one of the best burgers I've ever had. The sweet potato tater tots were great too. The service was great and the prices were very reasonable. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I ordered by mistake at the \"takeout\" area. They treated me like a subclass citizen and wouldn't let me sit down in the restaurant that was 80% empty. 

Horrible customer service, I'd give 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Very very good! Prices are great! Atmosphere is awesome and was very easy to find! Parked in the parking garage and then just walked to the corner where they are located and was seated and served immediate! The waitress was very good at her job and made sure our drinks were always full, and kept checking in. Definitely will be going back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fresh, tasty all American meal, look no further! We found the best spot on the strip. 

We had 2 \"The Our Burger\" and they were a good portion of meat, lettuce, tomato, cheese, pickles and sauce. You can taste every flavor in every bite. 

The thin crispy onion rings is made perfect! They're red onions and they taste so good. 

You can order to go too. I saw a lot of people doing that and we're happy to just try these amazing burgers. 

Yes, they're new...yes, they're busy, but so is every other restaurant in Las Vegas. 

Give Wahlburgers a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious. I had the burger with carmelized onions - it was fantastic. The onion rings were different than we expected. They're more like French fried onions but were still tasty. Two burgers, two beers, and the onions for $49."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad... where to start? Busy Saturday night in Vegas and they have just 1 cashier ringing in orders to go.... Yet I see 15+ employees walking around doing nothing... not to mention the poor cashier was so confused on how to modify a burger, it took her almost 10 minutes to put in my order for 2 people. When my burger came out it was completely wrong, when I brought it to the expediters attention she was extremely rude and sighed very loudly at me, grabbed the burger out of my hand and threw it to the cooks. Then once again the second time around the burger was wrong AGAIN! Like your job is not hard, you read a ticket and make the burger the way it says... My mothers tots were not sweet potato like she had ordered, the ceasar salad dressing was disgusting...it literally tasted like creamy mayo, no flavor- waste of a $10 salad I just threw it away after all the problems I had with my burger it just wasn't worth going back inside about the salad. The ice machine was broken and employees were looking at their phones and talking instead of offering to get Ice from the back for to go customers- the burger tasted great once we got it but just not worth the hassle it took to get it, wont be back here."}
{"text":"During the previous Rodeo weekend, I was craving a big juicy cheeseburger. I had heard of Wahlburgers due to a TV spot. Seeing as I was right outside of Bally's, I decided to finally pay my first visit. 

Although it was busy inside, I was able to find a spot in the corner of the bar as soon as I walked in. The bartender was quick and attentive, and I was able to place my order quickly. I decided to go with the double decker and some tots, both came out SUPER quickly. 

Overall, my burger was extremely enjoyable. I actually prefer it over what I had at Ramsay burger the night before, especially since the price at Wahlburgers was a lot cheaper. 

After I have tried every major burger place in Vegas, I'll pay Wahlburgers another visit, especially if we have visitors in town, and they're craving a burger on the strip."}
{"text":"So disappointed. If you're a NKOTB fan girl or fan of the Wahlburger show, then check it out but be prepared for lacklustre food and mediocre service. 

My out of town sister wanted to see this place since she's what I've described above haha. And I knew the minute we walked in, she wasn't the only out of towner. This place evokes the same atmosphere as Hard Rock Cafe or Niagara Falls. I wouldn't be surprised if no locals eat here. 

We were greeted at the door and explained the two different routes we could take: full, sit down service or head to the back for fast food. We chose to sit down and take in the whole experience. 

It took forever to get our drink orders in. There were probably 2-3 servers working and maybe 5-6 tables with customers but we waited really long just for the initial order. We watched customers arrive and head to back, order and head up stairs with food before we got served.

Once we did order, we found the portions small and the food mediocre. They serve the food in baskets and provide metal utensils which I found odd. The burger itself is dry and nothing special. I enjoyed eating the tater tots though they could be a bit more crispy and warm. 

Save yourself money and just head to Burger Priest or PnL for a quality burger that's probably cheaper."}
{"text":"Seasoned ground turkey, cranberry orange sauce, mayo, mashed butternut squash and turkey dressing on a bun. Called the Thanksgiving Dinner. Just saying, it is good! 

Took one point off for venue/layout - is it a sports bar, diner, or fast food takeout?"}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent food from this chain created by Mark Wahlberg and family. When we got here, the place was mad packed. Surprisingly, the wait wasn't too long. I think we only waited for about 30 mins. For my meal, I decided to order \"Mark's Favorite\" aka the Thanksgiving Day Sandwich. As you can imagine, it's basically a turkey sandwich. But it includes stuffing, house-made cranberry sauce and a few other things in the sandwich. I was expecting the turkey to be dry and stuff, but to my surprise, it was cooked to perfection and it was actually very delicious. My only gripe about it was that it was not as big as a Thanksgiving meal would be, but that's okay. So if you've got a big appetite and you're hungry, I might suggest ordering orders. We also ordered the fries, and they weren't bad either.

All in all, it was a surprisingly good place to eat. It was relatively affordable as well, which is always a plus! Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had in an airport (twice). My first trip to this location was right after it opened so I chalked up the poor service to that. Today as I sit here at the bar, I waited 8 minutes to be asked if I wanted anything, all while three bar employees felt the need to clean the bar and drink their own drinks instead of asking me if I needed help. I asked for a glass of water to start. Again, all three girls went back to cleaning things and chatting, instead of actually getting me that glass of water and taking the rest of my order. Finally after I asked a girl if she was here to help me (after waiting another 5 minutes) she gave me a disgusted look as if I was bothering her. Nothing has changed, they must have the same incompetent person training everyone. I will absolutely never come back to another wahlburger no matter where it is."}
{"text":"With all that star-power hype surrounding the Wahlberg name the expectations for Wahlburgers are set quite high. The overall quality of the food was good (but not great) and the people are friendly but as far as burgers go, there are quite a few other places that are better including Burgers Priest and Burger Works.

The space is divided into 3 areas; a bar, a full service area and a self service area. The bar seems to be the best compromise of actually being in the main part of the restaurant without having to wait for table service. The self service area is fine with tables and a few booths as well as some upstairs seating (which is small and secluded, near the washrooms). Also, small note, but dirty washrooms are really a thing of the past (or should be) for any restaurant that wants to get repeat customers. Get that _____ cleaned up!

The downtown location is close to the Rogers Dome and the expectation of huge crowds from Jays games and other events was probably a major factor in deciding the location. The entrance is located right across from Wayne Gretzky's and that's the easiest way to find it. There's a lot of construction next door so it might be easy to miss.

We had a BBQ Burger and a Double Stack, the poutine and Alma's chicken sandwich. The BBQ is a 5 oz patty which is \"smallish\" but well put together and juicy. The double stack features two 3 oz patties that when stacked on top of each other make it very messy to eat and you'll be left with no meat and lots of toppings. The fries used in the poutine are a bit small and don't seem to be hand cut. The best item we had, ironically enough, was the chicken sandwich.

All of our items seemed to have a bit too much \"special sauce\". And as for the price, yes it is a bit high but maybe that comes with a glimmer of hope that you might see a celebrity. We paid $32 for the BBQ Burger, Double Stack, Poutine and 2 drinks. Add to that $15 to park in the area and for less than 50 bucks, we get to say \"we ate at Wahlburgers\" and looked at a poster for Ted 2. I can't see this being a quickly expanding chain."}
{"text":"Food was cold long wait and on top of it all server added an item that I didn't order. Expected better! P.S fries do not come with the burgers!"}
{"text":"Decent burger, fried onions were good, very expensive as expected. This place is a tourist novelty so take it for what it is."}
{"text":"Honestly the burger was below average. But the service was beyond excellent. The staff were very attentive and I needed ice for my sore knee so the Manager went and got me a sealed ice bag from another restaurant across. I don't remember the managers name but he was of Indian descent."}
{"text":"Omg. So delicious. We got lucky because we were in Vegas for 7 days and when we first arrived it was not open yet. The 4th day we were in Vegas they were finally open!!! My mom got Mark's favorite and I got Jenn's sandwich. Soooooo delicious. The staff was super friendly. Can't wait till after the grand opening for the full menu."}
{"text":"Came at around 10:40 or 10:50 on July 13. I was in a rush and wanted my order to go. The host told me, ridiculously, that takeout was unavailable. That didn't make any sense. So I said, I guess I'll sit down, eat it quickly and go. Sat at the bar and placed my order. I'm sitting down, a bit edgy because not only do I have to get somewhere by 12:30 am, I've got to eat this too. Sometime around 11:20 to 11:30, I see a guy leave with a big bag of takeout, and I'm like, what is going on? The host basically lied to me. Not sure what her hustle is, but I'm guessing the whole goal was to get people to sit down, drink and order more, in addition to getting tips for the staff. Nice hustle. So I'm waiting, and this bar manager, Irish guy, winks at me!!! What in the world??? I'm not like that, men don't do that to other men where I'm from. I go off on the guy about what is going on and demand my order to go. I had enough and called them out about what was going on. I got my order, paid what was owed and kept the 20% tip I was going to give.

I was going to go to the Coney Island location in NYC a week ago, but decided not to because of the location, bad yelp reviews about service and other things. Come to Las Vegas, I've gotten bad service here too. The burger was alright, but honestly, there's so much competition, I won't ever go to a Wahlburger's in Vegas, NYC or Detroit. Get your staff in order Mark."}
{"text":"It's all hype. The burger was nothing special sweet potato tots were good but half burnt. The staff was horrible. Very unorganized in getting seated and 3 tables seated after us got drinks and food long before us. FYI no restrooms in building you have to go out to shops next door and their nasty. Then try getting back in. You are at the end of the line and host wants to reseat you. Way over priced. 2 people     2 burgers 2 sodas. $56. Go to in and out burger a much better deal and better burgers. And staff appreciates your business"}
{"text":"My mom came in town with Wahlburgers at the top of her list of places to try! Of course we all know, momma gets what momma wants! 

Both my mom, and my husband ordered burgers while I 
ate the portobello sandwich which was some seriously sloppy deliciousness. 

They both said the burgers were good, but it wasn't anything that they talked about on the ride home. 

Onion rings were  okay but not AH-mazing. We should have tried their tots! 

I would love to try their veggie patty, but unfortunately they don't serve it at this location. At least not yet. 
It was a fun spot to say we experienced, but I won't be running back any time soon. Unless- they start serving that new vegetarian burger."}
{"text":"Good taste, smaller size but tasty nonetheless. Had the \"our\" burger and I enjoyed it. Had the sweet potato tots, very sweet. Say hi to your mother for me."}
{"text":"$13 for double cheeseburger. Nothing special about it except it might have been dipped in grease prior to serving. Mac and cheese is ordinary. There are far better burger places in Vegas. Avoid this one."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The menu didn't have too many selections to the point where you were indecisive. I love food so it's hard for me. ?

They have multiple options for the type of diet you stick to, gluten free etc. 

This specific restaurant sat us right away at 5:00 on a Sunday in the city. Service was quick & efficient and the wait staff seems happy all the time. 

Ps - they have dessert. 

Get the sloppy joe."}
{"text":"Very basic for the price! The fries are nasty and cold with no flavor, I recommend the onion rings!"}
{"text":"It is a fun place to go to as inspired by the show. It is busy so expect to wait a bit. There are shops nearby to visit so that is helpful. We had a party of 6 and everyone enjoyed their food from burgers to salads. I highly recommend the sloppy joe. Delicious! 

The service is fine and attentive. They are pretty quick with their service as well. I love that when you order a drink you get to take the cool cup with you."}
{"text":"First time here ordered PAULS burger and a spiked strawberry lemonade which was way too strong had to order an extra lemonade which made it perfect first glance at the menu little overwhelming there's sooo much to see.. restaurant inside is small no bathroom inside little loud but understandable since there's a bar inside was little surprised We didn't get carded sauce on my burger was amazing delicious bummed out my burger didn't come with fries especially since the burger was 12 alone loved the walburgers decor of all the boys definitely worth to try I will be back"}
{"text":"Came in with my kids before a Cavs game. They got hotdogs which looked great and they enjoyed. I'm on a diet and had the Caesar salad with chicken which is one of the best I've had. The service was great too. Very happy with the non-Burger options. Hope to be back to try a burger next time."}
{"text":"If you are thinking about going here, don't bother. Service was ok, not the cleanest place, the food is nothing to rave about. Go to Gordon Ramsey's Burgr instead, prices are comparable to wahlburgers and the food is a hundred times better as is the service. Wahlburgers is famous name prices with drive through burger quality, even going that route I'd pick five guys or in-n-out."}
{"text":"All I have to say is $57 for 2 less than ordinary, smallish hamburgers, an order of fries and onion rings and 2 iced teas is ridiculously overpriced. The buns were freezing cold and the hamburgers were overcooked. Service was terrible and the overall experience was far less than underwhelming."}
{"text":"We have watched the shows and now we have enjoyed the food. The hamburgers were excellent just like mom would make. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This place was good, but extremely overpriced. I was expecting more of a \"sit down\" restaurant but this was more along the lines of a fast food joint. Food was good, but very expensive for what you get and the type of restaurant that it is."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service with mediocre food. Food did not live up to the hype. From the show, it appears that they have a lot of pride behind the food that is served. What we received didn't do their name justice. Burgers were just ok and gravy used for poutine came straight out of a jar. The salty dark brown stuff. Gross. The only reason they have 2 stars is because they had the beer I liked on tap..."}
{"text":"I got Paul's fave and the Yukon gold fries. I liked how the bun was really robust and kept the burger and all the toppings together. Often times, you end up with a complete mess. Everything tasted amazing and service was fast for it being as busy as it was."}
{"text":"Our NFR gang of 7 here and had excellent burgers. Not a long wait either, considering the busy area. I would sure return and suggest this stop to anyone."}
{"text":"I was not sure about another celebrity endorsed and backed restaurant featured in television for what is the best commercial ever. My husband really wanted to go and we did. This was a great experience. The food was fantastic and the servers at the bar were warm, friendly, attentive and would talk as they had a free moment. I had the OFD which was a juicy burger with mushrooms and bacon, the quality of the meat was fantastic. My husband had The Beast with pulled pork and blue cheese sauce. He said it was great, I didn't try it but it was huge. I couldn't finish mine, so he did. We also had the tater tots, which were crisp and not greasy. Overall a great experience and well worth the price that you would pay at another, similar place in Las Vegas. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Eh, service was great with a friendly staff, though they don't take any to-go orders over the phone which is kind of a huge bummer. The burgers and tots were OK, but not really worth the price but I did love the open faced sloppy Joe! Was worth stopping in at least once."}
{"text":"I've been to the Wahlburgers in downtown Orlando, Florida and thought it was very good, so was glad to hear that they were opening a restaurant here in Pittsburgh.  I went on a Saturday afternoon, so expected the place to be packed, and it was.  I was by myself, so I took a seat at the bar as it was a 45 minute to an hour wait for a table.  The bartender, Brendan, was quick to give me a menu and pour me a Wahlbrewski.  I ordered a double decker burger with mushrooms, a side of Yukon Gold fries and a side of Alma's Classic Macaroni.  It took about 1/2 hour or so for my food to come, but again the place was jammed.  The food was great, awesome burger done just the way I like and of course the \"government cheese\" makes it!  Alma's macaroni was very good....Kudos to her as I assume it's her own recipe.  Brendan was a good server and did a great job considering he was taking orders AND manning the bar.  I wasn't expecting things to be perfect since the place just opened and I'm sure the staff is still adjusting and learning the ropes, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed.  The restaurant was bright, shiny and spotless, and the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  Now, since I live in the South Hills, I'm hoping they open another restaurant closer to me."}
{"text":"The takeout counter was not staffed.  Talking to two wait staff who didn't care because it wasn't their job. Apparently the takeout counter staff wasn't at work.  After waiting for 10 minutes, one wait staff begrudgingly took my order but clearly was in a bad mood.  She kept asking me and another customer why we wouldn't want to eat in.  Isn't the takeout counter supposed be for takeouts?  Kitchen was no better that it took another 10 minutes to bring the food.  Finally, the food (signature burger, hot dog, onion rings) is just so so.  You are probably better off with going to Tim Hortons across the walkway."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 decided to go here for lunch just because of the Wahlberg's name/TV show/etc. We parked at Bally's and got to the restaurant around noon (on a Wednesday). It was a nice day so I asked the hostess if we could be seated on the (empty) patio. She said they don't serve food on the patio unless you take it to go, and they weren't yet doing to go orders. She said a 15 minute wait to be seated inside, but it was less than 5. 

Inside it's a cool place. The whole service is very strange though -- mix between a Smashburger/ In-N-Out/ Shake Shack and a sit down burger place. Our waiter was attentive and took our drink order (4 waters) and promptly filled 4 paper cups at the exposed Coke machine (which I later saw patrons using themselves). Three of us ordered the classic Wahlburger (one with bacon, one super well done, and one with some pink), an order of fries, an order of onion rings, and a Caesar salad. The waiter then took the order to a person working the computer at the counter. I saw several customers go up to this same individual to place to go orders. 

While we waited, a woman in a Wahlburgers tshirt approached us and said they were taking free photos as part of a promotion at the restaurant. She took a group photo and presented it to us about 15 minutes later. The photo was horrible and THEN she tried to sell us copies for a \"good price\". I told her we weren't interested and she just stared at me. She finally said \"you don't like pictures?\" and I told her no, we don't like the picture. She left us the free one and then stomped away. 

The food did not take too long to come out. The medium well and super well done burgers were mixed up, but everything came out okay. Everything (aside from the salad) was served in plastic baskets or paper cups. The onion rings are more like fresh made crunchy onions you put on green bean casserole, so ask for a fork. The fries were nothing special and definitely not worth the price. The burger was alright, but nothing to write home about.


Overall, at $16-20+ per person, I was expecting a burger of high quality, but it seemed no higher quality than a burger from In-N-Out. I still can't believe the burger doesn't come with fries like at a normal sit-down place. Save your money."}
{"text":"Not good. Will not be back. Too many other choices  nearby. Burger bland. Too long of a wait. Menu limited. Fast food restaurant category only slow."}
{"text":"Where do I start... ok Here goes!
The BURGER..um cooked perfectly and the BUN was just seriously .. really the right type of Bun to compliment the flavors without competing. NOW the big question .. Government cheese. HELL YES!
I hate hate hate melted cheese on anything but this was the exception. It was delicious without that gross greasy flavor!
We sampled fries , tots, sweet tots, and onion rings. NO Favorite.. chowed all of them and left nothing ! YUM YUM YUM!
Well there you have it. 
One last note.. one of our gals is vegan so she ordered the vegan burger.. it was tasty.. but word to the wise.. she had it with the sautéed sweet onions... it's a must for this particular one so you don't get a dry flavor but more of a sweet savory flavor! 
Cheers! #NowINeedTheGym!"}
{"text":"We had a blast. 20 minute wait. That was expected. Every member of the staff was great. All of us had burgers and they were cooked perfect. Had fries, tots, and onion rings. Onion rings were the winner followed by the tots. I'm a tots guy if they are cooked right and by right I mean golden and crunchy. These were perfect. Burgers were juicy. Now understand when you go it is a bit pricey but factor everything in and understand what you are walking into. Just go and enjoy. You were gonna put the money into a machine or on a good burger. Burger is the way to go."}
{"text":"Very friendly service staff.  I was impressed with how well they were trained, since only being open for such a short amount of time.  They were knowledgeable and accommodating.  The food on the other hand was incredibly poor and extremely overpriced, even by LV Strip standards.  1 burger, 1 chicken sandwich, 1 fries, 1 sweet tots and 2 sodas= over $50 with tax & tip.  Food was on par with any neighborhood McDonald's in relation to quality AND quantity.  Small portions of crappy food for exorbitant prices isn't really my thing.  I'm a Vegas local so I completely understand the Strip pricing, but for the quality of meal we received, it was outrageous!  You can get MUCH better food at the same price (or less)  at Bobby's Burger Palace, Fukuburger, Shake Shack or, of course, In-N-Out."}
{"text":"First time at wahlburgers. Ordered the BBQ bacon medium with fries. My first impression was that it looks rough and to small for the price.  The meet was cooked perfectly. The taste was average. The fries were to greasy. Result: find a real burger place. 
By the way a beer was 18$. Well. You can keep the plastic mug."}
{"text":"Wow.   An amazing burger.  I had the double and it was perfect.   Juicy and delicious.  Went for breakfast, what a great choice. Handled a group of 6 without hesitation."}
{"text":"Marking another one off my list at The Block. I was worried going here on a Sunday night at 5:30 would be a bad idea but there wasn't a wait at all. Regardless, I decided to just sit at the bar to watch the Kansas/Duke game.  It was seat yourself and had 4 decent sized TVs. 

The bartender Brendan was awesome. Friendly, informative and made you feel right at home. Everything you'd want.  I decided to try a Wahlbrewski because why not!  It was okay and that's about it.  Pretty standard.  As far as food, I really wanted that Double Decker Hotdog the very first reviewer had but was told there was no such thing. Even when I showed the pic I was told someone must have messed up...oh well!  Much like that reviewer, I have rarely seen a Sloppy Joe on a restaurant menu so I had to give it a go along with a side of Sweet Potato Tots.  Best decision of my day!  The portions were huge and I was beyond full when I left. High marks for the Homemade Wahl Sauce, Cheese Sauce and Dill Pickles! I'd order a side of Pickles next time on their own that's how good they were.  The Sweet Potato Tots are a great choice to compliment any dish and the Sloppy Joe itself was a perfect open faced sandwich with just enough mix of what your Mom would make and how a unique chef would fix it.  Try it out!

The prices are a bit high in my opinion, $8.95 for the Sandwich, $3.50 for the Tots and $6 for the Beer.  I'd like to see a side come with the sandwich but to their credit, the side was enough for at least two people. There had to be 50 Tots in there.

Overall, I liked it a lot. Between the friendly atmosphere and service I received and how much I enjoyed the food I ordered, I'll be back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Overall great service and even better food. Place was clean,  trying to talk my wife into coming here tomorrow. I wish they had one in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Meh. Why is this a sit down location? Why is a fountain coke $5? Why are your servers snarky? Why is the food decidely average? Why would I ever come back?"}
{"text":"We ordered the Our burger, Mac and cheese, and fries. The burger was cooked medium and it was really delicious. Very juicy! Our server was Rob and he was very attentive and so were all the other staff members. I would definitely come back and have another meal!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that we have been waiting for this place to open for months so you can imagine my excitement when I heard it was finally open. Now onto my experience. 

The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the \"Our Burger\" it was ok but it was just that, it was ok....nothing special. Along with my burger I tried the sweet potato tater tots, terrible idea. They were over salted, soggy, and just not appetizing. 

My boyfriend ordered the bbq burger and hated it. It was extremely small and extremely overcooked. He had the regular French fries and they were again just ok , nothing spectacular. 

My opinion like other reviewers, go to Burgers Priest and save a few dollars and get a better meal."}
{"text":"I watched the show for the first season and when I heard they were opening a location in Toronto I really wanted to check it out. The food tasted good but the portions are small and it is over priced. 

Also why do they have play walburger previews always playing."}
{"text":"Food was awesome my family each got a different thing. The chicken sandwich was quite tasty and the best was the Thanksgiving sandwich... omg this was quite delicious. My only complaint was the speed of service but this will get better as the site only opened 2 days earlier so it was understandable."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant owned by the Wahlburgs, yes those Wahlburgs.

The restaurant is on the strip by the Bally's casino. You can dine in or get food to go. There is a full service bar as well.

The menu has several styles of hamburgers. I had the cheeseburger with tots. It was good and reasonably priced especially for being on the strip."}
{"text":"Being a child of the 80's and a fan of NKOTB  ... I was excited to finally try Wahlburgers. 

Since it is new to the strip there was a bit of a wait ... 30 minutes.  We arrived at 7:30p and were sat at 8:00pm on a Friday night.    

The set up is casual with the dining room  wood, steel, and black/white overhangs that have word references to the Wahlbergs.  There is also an indoor/outdoor bar.  

Service was good, nothing spectacular.  While we waited we had a postcard photo taken that is complimentary.  Of course nothing is really free ... so we ended up getting two larger photos for a total of $25.00.  The picture person only takes cash, btw. 

When it came to ordering, I had the OFD (I just wanted to say Dorchestah) and it sounded right up my alley even though Jenn's Chicken Sandwich sounded delicious.  My friend did order Jenn's Chicken Sandwich, though.  My burger was served medium rare and was quite juicy however that made my bun soggy. :(  Overall, I found the burger quite tasty. I left it as is and did not have any special requests.  My friend loved her chicken sandwich.  It was a flavorful piece grilled chicken according to her. 

Sides are a la carte.  We both went with french fries ...nothing to right home about. Thin and crispy.  

I wanted to end the dining experience with a dessert.  It was not meant to be, the Crispy Apple Empanadas were sold out or maybe no longer available?  The two remaining cupcakes looked sad and I don't do fluffanuttas.  

Would I go again?  Sure thing.   I do feel that there could be improvements but I know it's a new opening and the kinks need to be worked out.  I do think the manager should do a tour of the dining room to check on the guests."}
{"text":"I don't mind supporting the Wahlberg Empire however, eating a $13 Burger off a plastic plate with plastic flatware and the smallest, weakest cocktail ever, just doesn't jive with me.

I can get a much better burger and fries at In N Out for just 12 bucks for both of us. 

This is a fad restaurant that simply won't last given the myriad of choices available.

This is a prime example of leveraging a name to take advantage of consumers."}
{"text":"Great burger, great service Emma. Great experience overall, considering we're in Vegas the burgers are reasonably priced. BBQ burger was awesome."}
{"text":"Quick and easy! Good place to go for a delicious burger. Has been consistent quality each time"}
{"text":"Tried it tonight after watching a concert at the T Mobile Arena.  Was worried that the wait might be long but we were seated really quick.  Our server Ross I think that's his name sorry... is very attentive he acknowledged us that he will be with us asap from the moment we got seated.  The place is decorated with Movies, TV Shows and NKOB posters.  My fiancé order the Double decker and I got the Donnie's Fav which is Cheeseburger with bacon and avocado spread.  I love that they asked how you want your burger cooked.  Was surprised that they give away the Green Plastic Cups if you do purchase soda with refills.  Had the sweet potato tots wasn't really a fan of that though.  All in all it was a good experience would probably come back with families from out of town for them to try it for themselves."}
{"text":"Well I'll be totally honest. I came here because the crowd was the smallest and it looked AC'd. Giordanos looked just too hot outside, Smashburger at Caesars having a huge line, Shake Shack just too far away, and needing to get a quick lunch, this seemed appropriate. 

I ordered a Fiesta Burger. Honestly I'd have to say that the patty was really nothing special, which in turn just made this an ok burger.  I actually probably prefer Fuddruckers over it. 

I ordered the shoestring onion rings as well. This was an incredibly large portion. They really just need to offer a small size at a reasonable price. Having a $6 basket the size of my face is really unnecessary for a party of 1. 

The nice thing though was a pretty reasonable beer draft list and pricing. They had local craft beer cans for $5 which is pretty good for the strip. 

Might not come back to this place."}
{"text":"I must say we really enjoyed it! Took my wife and kids, we had to wait lie 30 min, the place is somewhat small specially considering these people are famous and this place is in Vegas, we were looking forward to this place for a while and had very high expectations, (which I think makes it very easy to break your heart, lol). We ordered like almost one of each through all six of us, burgers were excellent, alma's mac and cheese awesome same as the tater tots... all in all service was good as well., and prices are fair... we left very happy,"}
{"text":"I loved it! My burger was delicious, I had the BBQ bacon burger which was delicious! I had it with the tater tots and they were very good too! My friends had the Melt burger and the double decker and they were both very happy with their choice. One friend had the onion rings and granted, they are not the conventional type, but they were great!! I actually liked them more than the usual rings.

Service was good too. Our server was a friendly young lady. It was quick and she did make sure we liked our burgers and had all we needed. I'm certainly going back again!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Burgers were great, we loved the fries. It's Vegas so it's pricey for a burger that doesn't come with fries, you have to add those on. Service sucked though. Our server was very attentive to the tables around us but my BF waited forever to get his 32oz beer. We never were asked how everything was, wasn't able to get refill on my soda. We wouldn't have minded if it was just a order/pickup type of place. 

Bright side they take your picture and give you a complimentary keepsake."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed by the Walburgers burgers at all. On the show, Donnie makes a big deal about the Donnie burger being the best ever. I tried it just to see if he was right. I think he feels it's the best cuz its named after him. The Donnie burger is basically a bacon cheese burger with bbq sauce and jalepenos. The burger is nasty!  Meat is tasteless, the jalepenos are hard and gross. And most of all, they don't grill the bun. You get a cold bun. I'm not even going to try another one being that the bun isn't even grilled. I wouldn't even give it one star but I have to rate it somehow."}
{"text":"We went to this place when we in Toronto. We got seated pretty quickly. Took a few minutes for the server to come over it wasn't busy. The food was average wasn't nothing special overly priced"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I have to admit that we came in here because of the name and because my friends are huge NKOTB fans. :)

The burgers itself are just ok.  We came at 11pm so were not that hungry, and we were able to order the smalhburger, which is - as you would expect - a small/kids size burger. A great deal for $7.95 which also comes with a side!  The burger was just 'ok'; nothing that special in my mind.  Between my friends and I, we had 3 different sides - onion rings (more like, fried onion strings), sweet potato taters, and regular tater tots.  All three were pretty luke-warm (maybe it was sitting under the warmer for the while b/c it was late?)

Aside from that, the service was really good.  But with all the other selections on the strip I probably would not come here again.  That said, I still love NKOTB. :)"}
{"text":"Was so excited to finally get here and it didn't disappoint! We went before the Cavs game. They told us 30 minute wait, we waited about 20. Ourwaiter was good. The food was delicious! Great burger and loved the sweet potato tots and onion rings. Will come again."}
{"text":"Wahlburgers?.....more like
Cold burgers....sat there and waited 50 mins just too eat a nasty cold burger, they have good service though , the waiter was really nice. Don't get gator tots they taste like the ones from my high school... overall I would never go back, make sure not too order the melt."}
{"text":"Been a fan of the show, so naturally I wanted to see what the hype was about. Great food, prompt service (food literally was at our table within 15 minutes from ordering) & good libations. The hubby ordered the Thanksgiving day turkey burger (which she states is the best turkey burger he's had yet) and I went with the surf and turf lobster burger. The lemon chive sauce was the perfect touch of indulgence. During our 3 day getaway in Las Vegas, we indulged in Wahlburgers two of our three days. Definitely recommend can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Kept passing by this place and I was intrigued as it's always packed. It's both a sit down and take out burger joint with a bar as well. We opted for the latter because it was already late; there are places to sit on the second level (by the washrooms). I was boring and ordered the original burger (forgot its name) with tater tots and a soft drink. For what I was paying, the portion was quite small. Burger joints in the city are a dime a dozen so I'll be okay checking out another business for my burger craving.

Good for: burgers, drinks"}
{"text":"The wait was a bit long but the food was excellent. I ordered the melt with added jalapenos & my husband got the OFD both with fries. They were both very good plus the manager brought us out some \"special\" sauce for free to try with our fries it was equally as good. Our waitress was attentive & friendly. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to try this place. I am a huge fan of this family. I wentNeedless to say by the end I just wanted to leave. There was a small wait, however there was space at the bar. Being that we had an hour drive back home we decided to take the bar. We did get drinks within five minutes of sitting down. Our order was taken about 20 minutes later. When our food came out, we needed silverware. Took ten minutes to flag down the bar tender. He was to busy talking to someone about about how Mark hates being called Marky Mark and how he's so excited about the appearances that will be made this year. Also talked  about them being 2/3's owner of the Pittsburgh location. He finally saw I wasn't eating my food and came over. Took another probably 15 minutes for him to bring it to me since his conversation was more important than my now cold food not being eaten. My husband and I both ordered fries, which the container was maybe half full. No biggie for me due to my not being a big eater, but if those are the portions then why make people pay extra for them?! I waited for nearly 10-15 for a refill on my drink. I had it sitting on the edge of the bar. Even took it off and but it back down just in case he didn't notice the first time. My burger probably would have looked better coming from McDonalds and I hate fast food. If your looking to try something with a great experience and good food try something else. I heard Burgatory is opening up another location nearby so I doubt this place will last if something isn't changed.

To update from my last review. The owner quickly responded to my review from before! Was really nice. My husband and I went back with some friends and our experience was a lot better. Service was great! Food was fantastic. We used the No Wait app, so we didn't have to wait long either. We have gone back a couple of times since and have had positive feedback for each time."}
{"text":"I ordered their bahn mi turkey burger. The description said it came with kimchi on the side. When I got it, it was only raw sprouts with 3 shreds of carrot. The favor was ok. It's definitely more of an American twist to the bahn mi. The turkey patty was super moist so that part was great. The sweet potato tots are delicious as well."}
{"text":"The food is great. I like that you have a choice of fries or tattle tator tots. They play fun and exciting music. They also have a variety of alcohol!"}
{"text":"It's better to just go to mcdonalds and save $. The Burger is decent at best and price is ridiculous high."}
{"text":"Ross was great! Fiesta burger was good an juicy. Good food and not a bad price for vegas. Good spice and the beef had a good flavor. I'm from SC so it was a bit pricy but again not bad for Vegas"}
{"text":"So I'm assuming that this was only the \"Soft\" opening. 
So let me start here, we were seated a table ASAP. A waiter came over to explain the menu to us. But then proceeded to let us know he was not our actual server and that she would be over soon. 

Our waiter who's name was Keirston did not really know the menu yet. Which is fine because everything is still new. She asked if we wanted any drinks (we placed those orders) Waters with lemons, Red Sangria, White Sangria, and 2 beers. The drinks came out fairly quick. Next she asked us what we wanted. 

Orders:
I ordered A \"triple burger with no cheese\" it was supposed to come with lettuce, cheese, onion, pickle and \"wahlsauce\". My Burger came out just with the patty and bread. NOTHING ELSE.
My sister ordered a double decker burger with everything on it. And a side of Mac N cheese. They forgot to serve her Mac N Cheese. And after she received her order they never gave her a fork to eat with, Even after reminding her!

The other meals consist of 3 double decker burgers with everything on them. With a side of fries and tots. Their meals came out as is.

Our meal took about 1:30 to come to our table. Even had to ask how long it would be, receiving \"it should be on its way\".  I thought this was very inappropriate. They were only making BURGERS !! 

After all was said and done. My total was under $30.00 and my card was charged $66.00!!

I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Didn't expect to find Wahlburgers in Vegas. Loved the burgers, cooked to your requirements."}
{"text":"Both of our burgers were delicious...the tots were perfectly crisp just the way we like them and the service was fantastic..."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had a burger and it was cooked perfectly. Good quality beef... The service absolutely sucked. I'm not sure of the server was having an off day or just didn't care to be at work. She barely checked on us and seemed to have an attitude when i would ask for something. I would definitely go back. I just hope I wouldn't get the same server."}
{"text":"After all the hype, I was very underwhelmed. The food was bland and the menu was boring. Maybe it's just because they are new and still learning? Although, I did enjoy the tater tots. I'll try again in a few months."}
{"text":"We stopped here after a crazy night on the strip...we were starving at that. Maybe the food was so amazing for this reason idk. But I had a cheeseburger, fries, and orange cream soda. It was sooooo good lol. I'll definitely be back even if not out on the strip. The service was fast although it was close to closing time."}
{"text":"The yam tater tots are a waste of money they are like eating mashed yam ball that have been under Fried. My \"runny\" egg was completely cooked until the yolk was like rubber. Onion rings were like eating gulf seafood after the BP oil spill. The design of the restaurant is confusing not sure if I wait to order or sit down and wait to be seated. I was told a 30 minute wait for a table but there are 9 tables outside that are open.

Finally Wahlberg cult of personality decorations is garish."}
{"text":"I stopped into the Las Vegas outpost of Wahlburger to have the double-decker burger, which was surprisingly not shitty. This was my first experience at any Wahlburger, and I expected to be writing this review with a vituperative bent but I have nothing but good things to say about this burger: beefy, well-seasoned, well-flavored, lovely melty cheese -- and an outer char on both 3-ounce patties that was delicious and texturally nice. Thick crispy pickle slices were mild and pleasant, obviously made in house instead of being jarred or canned. The \"Wahl\" sauce, the so-called family secret, tasted like Thousand Island dressing mixed with Sriracha Sauce. It served the burger well. 

I'm from the Boston area originally, which is not a burger-y part of the country, so it's not like Wahlburger is representing a cuisine or is \"serious food.\" Indeed, there's no regional yardstick to measure Wahlburger's \"authenticity\" against -- although the Las Vegas service staff is undoubtedly more attractive than you would find in Massachusetts. Beyond that, this really is its own thing. I don't watch the show, nor do I care to. Judging the product by what was served to me, I was very pleased -- my only big quibble being that $13 feels like the wrong price on the Vegas strip, where good, cheap burgers are plentiful.

Food/Décor/Service: 4.0/3.0/3.5"}
{"text":"To quote Jewels from Pulp Fiction \"Now that's a tasty burger!\"  Nice fluffy bun, burger patty cooked just the way I like it (medium well), with fresh toppings and crispy bacon.

About 10 years ago, Mark Walburg had  a recipe on the celebrity recipe page in People magazine and it was his mother's macaroni salad.  I actually made it a bunch of times.  Well it's on the menu at Walburgers so I was curious how close mine was to theirs, nailed it!

Was there for lunch during working hours so I only had iced tea to drink.  But they do have a nice beer and booze selection."}
{"text":"Don't buy into the hype.  Thought we would give this place a try after the tv show.  I got just the basic burger cooked medium.  Somehow they cooked it right And yet it was still dense and dry.  Fries were cooked in old oil and had a weird corn dog flavor.  I will say the bun was fantastic but I would never go back.  Paid $70 for 3 burgers fries and drinks.  I wanted it to be good and was let down enough to leave a review, which I never do."}
{"text":"There are two parts to this restaurant: Table service & walk up counter. We elected to go to the counter, got an OFD & Our Burger, an order of fries & an order of poutine. They brought out our food relatively quickly, and it was hot & delicious. No complaints with the food itself. Only complaint was the price. Nearly $40C for two burgers and sides?!? Dang, super expensive! I get it's Toronto, NYC of the North but holy buckets, idk if I'd do it again."}
{"text":"Was told they would test when it was time to be seated.  No text message. When I asked the waitress how much longer it would be. She informed me that they had to give my table away because I didn't answer the text I didn't get. They couldn't even tell me the number that should have been texted too. It's 2:15pm on 03-31-18."}
{"text":"It was ok. I had the tater tots as a last minute thing. Service was very good and prompt. Just the tots tasted like they had been under lights for a while. Not fresh. I'd try them for a burger but would get regular fries instead. Decent for the type of food usually found."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it here. The burgers were good, reasonably priced. The sides (French fries & Mac and cheese) were not good. Fries were cold and starchy. Mac and cheese wasn't much better than boxed."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out.  Let me say that the name will get you in the door, but you need to have good food to get people to return.  Sadly, that won't be happening for us.  This was nothing more than VERY overpriced fast food.  $50 for two burgers, two sides, and two pops??!!  We  could have gone to McDonald's for $10 and had the same quality.  I was expecting the burgers to resemble something you'd find at a sit down restaurant (i.e. Applebees at least!).  The tater tots seriously looked & tasted like the ones I make at home (i.e. Ore Ida).  They just opened one in Detroit and I may try that one to see if it's any different, but I'm thinking they're all the same.  So bummed!"}
{"text":"The Food was awesome! We had the our Burger. My kids had the chicken fingers. The only issue I had was paying $4 for fries."}
{"text":"This place was packed when we got in; although, being new and popular I expected this. Their was a lot of front of the house staff that didn't seem too in to their jobs. They just stood their chatting and playing around with each other. There were a few tables open but they were apparently being held for other people. 

Finally another hostess came to the front and got things moving. We were seated outside, which was fine it was a nice day. However, I wish smoking wasn't allowed so close to where we were eating. 

Our food was good. I really enjoyed my burger but the tots were just ok. They didn't taste homemade or anything special. Our server was good as well. I might go back once the hype wears off."}
{"text":"It was a good place to eat the sides are amazing I had the bacon Mac and cheese real thick bacon and the Mac and cheese was so rich and delicious. The onion rings are not your typical onion rings they are thinner and seasoned but absolutely delightful especially with the homemade sauce. The burgers were great to greatly seasoned awesome portions and service was fast and pleasant definitely a place I would go back to it's a very family oriented restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger, well put together, with quality toppings. The patty was cooked exactly as I ordered it, medium, but just lacked any \"pop\" or \"wow\" factor, under seasoned. Service was quick and attentive. All in all, only 3 stars due to price($17 burger and fries only) at that price, I feel like I could have gotten the same quality of burger at Habit or Five guys around the $8-10 range with fries and drink."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, good price, and it is placed in an excellent location. The place is a bit too loud, but you should already assume it with the looks of it"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to Wahlburgers while visiting family and friends in Las Vegas.  It is STILL a legit and great place to eat. I was shocked of how fast the food came out after we ordered. I had a regular margarita and shared a Donnie burger with some chili cheese fries. The burger was cooked to perfection and the chili fries were out of this world.  The chili has awesome flavor!  I totally recommend going to Wahlburgers when you are in the area, they do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Whoo hoo! Walked in on a Tuesday night @2100 and got sat instantly. Everyone was very nice. 

Waiter was fantastic! Quick accurate and prompt.

Chili and burger were great. Tots were good too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the burger was dry and the sauce just didn't inspire much. That being said, the bun was solid. The potato tots were more from a \"bag\" than something unique to the restaurant. Sorry."}
{"text":"Very expensive for a family of four. When we didn't want to purchase a picture of us all the girl ripped them from my hands and walked off angry. We watch the Wahlburgers reality show and I just wonder if they know the lack of customer service. Disappointed:("}
{"text":"Came here with my brother.  The food here is actually tasty.  Wanted to try this out but never got to it till now.  

I gave this a 3 star because the food here was actually quite overtly oily.  The paper that was holding my burger was saturated with oil.  I could definitely feel the oil as well on the buns.  The onion strips or fries, forgot what they call them, definitely tasted like condiments you would put on salad, but oily.  The food and all was tasty, but that's probably because there is a ton of oil in the burger and sides themselves.

P.S. I like the cups they use for beverages.  Sturdy."}
{"text":"This place we awesome. Quick seating, great staff, and an awesome burger! Order a Mexican coke for extra awesome."}
{"text":"I liked this burger it was delicious. The fries were also good. Buuuuut. There wasn't enough of anything. Not enough bang for my buck I'll say.  But it was worth the 45 min wait. Would have been longer if If we had 4 people instead of 2. Lucky there was a bar across the street"}
{"text":"We were there before catching the Cavs game! Food was awesome and our waiter was great. Very kid friendly and our food came out fast!!"}
{"text":"2nd day open, when we arrived there was a small line of people checking in. When we reached the front of the line we were greeted by the friendly staff and explained that it would be about a 20 min wait. Wanting to try the burgers we put our name in, wait time was about 10 min. Food was delicious, staff was friendly, service was great!"}
{"text":"I really think this place will be worthy of four or more stars.  Once they get their stuff together.  To me it appears training all around lacked.  They were in such a hurry to get it up and running before the NBA playoffs and capitalize on the Cavaliers, that training lacked.  
My food came out horribly undercooked.  I ordered medium and it came out rare.  The tater tots were smushy.  The iced tea was good. But can't screw that up.   The wait stuff were not sure what to do.  There were plenty of seats avail but we were told 45 mins to an hour to get seated.  
I will go back after a few months.  If they don't have their stuff together at that point.  I'll never go back again.  
What a shame from such a high profile name."}
{"text":"This is probably the best burger joint on McKnight road! Service was very good and fast. But make sure you get a reservation if you arriving around dinner time!"}
{"text":"I was DISAPPOINTED. Maybe my family and I expected better because of the tv show. 1st of all I will say the the burger was DELICIOUS...however....the wait for the food was ridiculous. I asked for my burger well done, it wasn't!! It was pink & my daughter's burger was worse than mine. And I ordered her's from the kids menu. The waiter apologized and was very honest about the restaurant not being open long. Let me fill you in on the prices so you are AWARE. Burgers are a bit pricey ($10-13) & be ready to spend $5 for a side of fries because combos do not exist. The fries are good but order them FRESH! The drinks are about $. I hope the family gets their restaurant up to par. I would hate to read more negative reviews.
On the plus side: the waiter was the one who encouraged the manager to take 50% off of the bill. Our total would have been $84!!!! That's just for 4 burgers. 2 kids meal. 3 drinks (my husband got water!!). A side of fries & a side of onion rings."}
{"text":"Had heard so much about this place figured it was about time to give it a try. Was in Toronto for a concert at Rogers Centre and since this place is on a blue jays way it's pretty close. Burgers are what the place is about and they don't disappoint, the patty is juicy and cooked just right. The signature Wahl sauce is a perfect compliment along with the stated homemade pickles. The bun has a nice  slight outer crunch with the inside soft and buttery. We also ordered the Mac and cheese , now this was a huge disappointment , it's arrives in a take out cardboard soup style cup , getting past that we try it out. We taste the pasta but not one hint  of cheese. Hoping the cheese is at the bottom we empty the Mac into my empty burger bucket  looking for some  gooey cheese sauce , unfortunately we don't find any.  It's like soup , maybe that what they serve it in a soup cup. I've had cheesier Mac out of a Kraft dinner box. 
So if burgers are what you crave go here but avoid the Mac and cheese at all costs.  I did mention this to our server and he said he doesn't eat Mac and cheese so he couldn't say if it was soupy or not. it was."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ Bacon burger and sweet tots. Was really good! Soft brioche bun and juicy medium burger. I really liked it.

Definitely a great option for a 12$ price point."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, had great atmosphere. Burgers were cooked great and onion rings with red onions were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers were cold, fries were cold and soggy, could not get a drink refill to save your life.    Wait staff fighting for WHO HAD TO WAIT ON OUR TABLE.   As a customer who has eaten many times in a Wahlburgers before in the northeast, my visit here in Vegas was more than subpar.  In fact the entire experience from walking in the door to the attitudes to the cold food and very poor service just SUCKED ALL AROUND!!!
One positive-the burger even cold had great flavor, which shows they could do it better if they cared.

**** UPDATE ****
It's been over seven months since I've posted this bad review of Wahlburgers's in Las Vegas and still as of today I have not gotten one email response back from anybody with the restaurant chain so obviously they know the problems and don't really give a flip"}
{"text":"It was a $14.00 double burger. It was fried but not much taste. Came a-la-carte which is pretty cheap considering it was $14.00!! Also the the sweet potato tots as the side. Our server was Fernando. An uninterested server that tried to be interested in what we needed but wasn't very good at it. He/Wahlburgers doesn't need to care. All their customers are transient."}
{"text":"I was here with my husband and sister in law last week. Loved the burgers we devoured them. The macorni and cheese was extremely watery that was the only negative thing. Maybe was just a bad day. We come here every time we are in Vegas. Yum"}
{"text":"Really good service and great burgers and fries. Hit the spot big time! We both got the burger with the tomato jam on it, yum. Even  got a gluten free bun...may not sound like a big deal but if you have to eat gf, then you'll understand!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burger, hot beer, hot soda, soggy sweet potato tots. Not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"This place is all about the hype and the name. There truly is nothing special about it. Burgers and salads like anywhere else. I will say the fries tasted really good. It didn't look like there were any seasonings on them, so I think the flavor comes from what they fry them in."}
{"text":"I live not too far, so I went last night with friends to give it a try. 

The decor is ok, but I am really not a fan of the green they put everywhere, I just don't think it goes well in a restaurant. 

You can either sit and get served or go order to the counter and sit wherever. 

The cashier was very patient and helpful when we were ordering. I was quite famished and she suggested a good size burger. I had the Our Burger (8oz) and fries. Burger was quite tasty and decent portion. The fries were OK but lacking a bit of flavor. 

My 2 friends both ordered The Melt and fries. They were both happy with it. 

Like other people mentioned before, even if we said we were dinning in, we got all our orders in boxes and disposable cups. What's the point to ask then? 

I might go back, but only for take out as I cannot say my experience in the dining room was so amazing."}
{"text":"Came on lunch to get a burger. Was so pumped. Especially after I found out they have a gluten free bun. Walked in and was greeted by a nice young man. He told us where to go. Was standing in ordering when a waitress came over to the counter and started shouting at a manager about her order being messed up for someone. And the poor girl at the register was apologizing the entire time and finally said, she's trying to order. The waitress looked back at me and just turned back around started complaining to her boss again. Finally he said ok, step over there and went and told the people behind the counter to let her know when her food was ready. I paid $13 for a basic cheeseburger and I got sweet potato tots. Waited over 20 minutes for our order. That is to be expected Downtown Cleveland, during lunch time while there is a day time Indians game! The dining room is amazing!! it is so clean, everyone has room, yes, fluffy people room too. there is even an outdoor patio where you can enjoy your meal as well. Tons of staff and they're all running around making sure that people are being taken care of. 
Back to the food. Presentation is wonderful. Looked great was so excited. The pickles were ok, but good on the burger. I had to pull the lettuce off because I can't eat it, but wanted it for the pictures. Took a bite. Crunchy. The burger was burnt. Took it apart to inspect. Ate the pickles, left the bottom bun because it was soggy and just ended up eating the top bun and burger and cheese. There wasn't enough of the special sauce on the burger either. Enough to taste it though. It was good! Was kinda bummed, but hey, I have tater tots. Soggy! I ate 1. I was SO PUMPED about eating here. $13 to eat a tot and a patty, cheese and a top bun. The bun was great! That was the only thing that was good. I will have to go back another day and give them a try again, something different, and when they hype has died down and they're not so busy. But for now, I wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"I was in Boston back in April and my one regret was not being able to squeeze in a visit to Wahlburger's so when I found out there was one in Vegas, I had to try it!  The walk from the Aria was about 0.6 miles but takes like an hour due to the up down left right pedestrian bridges as you can't just walk straight down Las Vegas Boulevard.  Oh well, part of the adventure and a surefire way to exceed your daily step goal.

Since I was alone, I was able to get a spot at the bar.  Placed my order and the drink came quickly but the food was a bit on the slow side.  Definitely built up the anticipation.  When it came, I had to get my pictures then started diving right in.  The cocktail was Hibiscus Boo and it was delicious but a little weak.  The bacon mac and cheese was a little lacking in cheese as others have mentioned.  I just stirred it up as most of the cheese mixture dripped to the bottom and this helped mix up the bread crumbs as I almost choked on my first bite.  Decent but not all that.  I got the Our Burger and it was pretty awesome.  Cooked a perfect medium, juicy and flavorful.  No regrets that I skipped out on tots/onion rings/fries in order to overindulge on the items I did get.  Let me tell you, I recently started a diet and lost about 5 lbs, but it all went down the tubes, I ate every single bite!  It was fun, I'm glad I gave it a try."}
{"text":"Just meh. Marketing gimmick more than a restaurant. 

Disappointed that the food wasn't more spectacular or the menu more creative given what a great chef Paul is supposed to be. Thought we'd get a little taste of Boston, home to university crowds and sports fans, and that they would be going on a great menu instead of just the Wahlburg name. The TVs all had their show playing so it was like an ad campaign for the show and their brand. 

We had the Our Burger and the BBQ Bacon Burger which were good, but nothing special. Appreciated the smaller portion sizes, but not everyone will. Hugely disappointed in the Caesar salad which (was forgotten in the order) arrived plain Jane with all romain hearts, no leaves, dressing from a jar, powdered Parmesan cheese, no lemon, something you might find in Swiss Chalet or Olive Garden. White vinegar and yellow mustard - it doesn't get much more American than this folks. 

Oh, and people were lined up against the wall waiting for empty tables that weren't set. And it was just before high-noon on a Sunday so it wasn't like they had just been slammed. Staff holding conversations right in front of tables which isn't comfortable when seated. 

$56 (before tip) for two burgers, a Caesar salad, one order fries, one beer and one 6oz glass of wine ($12) - definitely not worth it. Better burgers at Heros and food and menu at any of the Firkins. Sorry boys, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"How this place is not rated 5 stars is beyond me. Claudia is the best waitress we've had in Vegas, bar none. The burgers are to die for, the tater tots are amazing, and we had the best time. Five stars. We will abso-effing-lotely be back!!"}
{"text":"Wahlbahgahs! Love this family, love the food and loved the staff. It wasn't opened earlier this year but they had a huge sign saying \"Coming Soon.\" I just happened to walk by this time and saw it was open. So I gave it a shot.  It's in a weird spot. It is accessible from the side walk on the strip or from Bally's Casino. From the casino just head towards the escalators leading to Las Vegas Blvd and it's at the bottom. Make a left.  From Bellaggio fountains cross the street towards Bally's and it's at that corner. If you are at Cesar's Palace or Bellagio Casino walk towards the walkway bridge. From their you can see the Green W and sign. However, it looks closed or not open yet from this angle.  Cross over the walkway, go down escalators and make a left. Pass all the small kiosk type shops. Then tucked in the back of this corridor on the right is Wahlburgers. 
     I had zero wait time. Walked straight in and had a seat at the bar. It's tight spacing and a bit crammed. The bar has huge garage style windows that open up so you can sit outside. It's November.  60 degrees with 40 mph wind. The nice bar gal and I were were cold. She was smart to have a hoodie.  
     Ambiance is very loud. Flat screens, loud music and the ice cream place across from them had loud reggae blaring. It's an open kitchen so that noise mixed in makes for a very loud dining experience. It's got a sports bar type of feel. 
     The menu is 100% Bostonian humor with a touch of their Boston accent. The menu is marked to show each of their favorite burgers including their moms.  They ran out of Empanada :( so that means I will return to try it. I went with The O.F.D Burger, Thin Crispy Onion Rings and Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  It's all Ala Carte and a lot of the menu sides are House Made.  The artisan bun is buttered, toasted and ready for a 1/2 lb burger patty. Add some bacon, saute'ed mushrooms, house made tomato sauce and slow melted Swiss cheese. Quality burger cooked to your liking. Good burger.
     The Thin Crispy Onion Rings are a nice change up to having fries. It's got a light tempura type batter and well seasoned. These can become very addicting. The movies should offer this at their concession stand. One order probably last the entire movie. The sweet potato tater tots is also a good choice to pair with your Wahlburger. I could only finish half of my meal. It was a lot of food.  I also tried the Wahlburger Beer. It's spicey and hoppy. 
    My bartender gal was awesome and I wish the family more success. If you're in Vegas check out the New Kids on the Culinary Block on the Strip. Cheers my Yelp Funky Bunch :)"}
{"text":"Their strawberry Moscow mule was so good . Had their new impossible burger and, so much flavor. Amazing. Wasn't thrilled that it was almost $20 but for someone who doesn't eat meat, it was worth it . The environment is fun as well ."}
{"text":"I have heard about Wahlburgers before but never in a place where they were until I found one in this airport terminal. Now, an airport terminal isn't, in my opinion, the best place to experience a restaurant, but sometime, you've got no other choice!

It was pretty busy, but not overwhelming. Don't you hate it when you're eating in a terminal restaurant and people keep bumping into you with their luggage? I was seated immediately off to the side of the bar and was greeted momentarily by my waitress.

I wanted to get their Thanksgiving sandwich but they were out of stuffing which sucked. Ever get so excited for something and then get it ripped out from under you? That was me in that moment.

I ended up with the our burger and tater tots. The burger was good. A standard American burger with the typical fixings. It was good, but didn't stand out as a wow! The bun was very fresh and I appreciated that for sure. The tots were great but you pay $4 for a side and get a handful. It comes in a cute cup. Keep the cup and give me more potatoes.

I'd like to give them a shot again at a standalone station, and not at a terminal to see if there is a difference. Things were good, but maybe elsewhere they are great?"}
{"text":"I've been to a Wahlburger's once before (in an airport) so I really didn't feel like I've had the full experience, so while in Vegas I decided that I needed a burger for lunch, and it had to be a Wahlburger.

Located in that shopping/dining area outside of Bally's, it was pretty easy to find. It has a nice bar connected to it in front and I imagine, if there was any particular sporting event you'd want to watch, this would be a good place to see it. Me, I just wanted to eat.

My waitress came, was super friendly and we chatted briefly about Drake, which was great, then took my order.

I started with their smoked bacon mac n cheese. Good Lord was this amazing. Penne pasta, smoked bacon, \"government\" cheese (per the menu) a mix of other cheeses, with house made parmesan panko breadcrumbs. I should have just stopped here, because this was really all I needed. So delicious and satisfying, but of course I had more because, why not?

My burger was their O.F.D. which is a  1/2 pound burger, Swiss cheese, bacon, sautéed mushrooms and their tomato jam and a side of tator tots. The burgers come cooked medium unless otherwise asked, which I'm totally okay with a medium burger. The burger was huge. Much bigger than I anticipated even though I knew it was 1/2 pound. I couldn't finish it! It felt slightly undercooked for a medium, but it was still tasty.

The service got a little spotty. Other waitresses kept checking on me, refilling my cup and such. Getting my check was kind of a pain.

Overall things were good here. I'd come back and would recommend Wahlburger's to any burger fan. 

Oh, and make sure to snap a picture of you and the Marky Mark cut-out that's there."}
{"text":"Fans of the show so we had to eat here on our trip. Food was great. They seated right away with little wait time even though it was super busy. Disappointed that our burgers weren't hot just barley luke warm fry's were hot and Mac and cheese was so good we got the added bacon but too thick and hard we didn't like it. (Mac and cheese was bomb one of the best) It took a really long time to get the food. Waiter was super friendly tho. 

I got the traditional burger \"Paul's favorite\" with added bacon  even tho it wasn't hot the taste was delish my favorite part was the bun. My husband ordered traditional with a double patty and an added egg \"double decker\"

We also ordered Lemonade it was so good came with green souvenir cups to take home. 

There was a lady taking pictures and selling them for twenty dollars I wasn't going to purchase but the turned out so well so I did 

Super yummy Hopefully next time it will be hot"}
{"text":"First time here, really liked it. We sat at the bar, came to take order really quick. Food took about 13 -15 minutes and delish! I got a portabello sandwich, my friends got burgers. We all were all very happy.  Reasonably priced. Thumbs up!!! Bartender JR. Was absolutely fabulous .. Very friendly, and you can't go wrong with that Irish brogue !"}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. Avoid at all costs. Staff are inept, food inedible.

Everything about it from the filthy floors and tables, bringing out the wrong orders, staff having no idea of what's on the menu, a general unpleasantness and high prices should keep anyone from patronizing this establishment. This is a situation where the tim Hortons across the hall has food 100 times better. 

Don't go here."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were excited to try this place since we are huge fans of the show, and the guys. We decided to share a burger since we wanted a big meal later at night. We had the BBQ burger, it was good, but lacked a little \"zing\" We also ordered the regular tater tots, they were yummy but a bit on the cold side. Loved the Wahl sauce. Waitress/bartender was very friendly and attentive. Cost for us both was $18, bot bad for Vegas."}
{"text":"Well, I found myself strolling along the strip with my three high school friends...still a little weary from the night before.  They had already started drinking, but at least it was beer.  We were in need of burgers...nothing better after a night of drinking...well, besides Chinese or food from a taco shop.  Since none of these were in sight, we decided to give the Wahlburg family a try...as did a good percentage of the strip...LOL!

We had to wait about 40 minutes, but that's what you get when you arrive at 12:30...LOL!  Once we were text, we were given a booth between the bar and the kitchen.  Of course, since they were busy, it took a while for our server to get to us, though he did say hi and say he'd be right back.  He took our order and delivered drinks, and then we waited.  It did take a while for the food to come out.  My burger was still hot, while the others were warm to cold.  The onion rings were luke warm.

Dave: The hottest thing here are the tater tots!

They probably came up last.  My burger was good, although the barbeque sauce was on the side which was odd.  The others said they were ok since they didn't come out hot.  Overall, it was a nice experience, but I don't think I'll come back.  I feel it's more hype than substance.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is chill inspite of being in Vegas.  I did think the government cheese was a funny thing...and some of the decor was pretty positive.  But for me, I'll remain neutral.  Check it out if your curious...like everything in Vegas, you should try everything at least once!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service sucks ass. Sitting here and bartender doesn't offer for another drink. She didn't even ask if the food was okay and if needed anything elder.  But they sure do have enough time to talk to each other and fuck around with the servers"}
{"text":"Wahlburgers is always a must when im in vegas and my favorite bartender is Rodrigo! He is super friendly and offers great customer service. My favorite is jenn's chicken sandwich with extra tartar sauce. Delicious"}
{"text":"We were not sure what to expect. Just because a restaurant has a celebrity name does not mean it's good. We were pleasantly surprised how good the burgers are. I was really impressed that they offer any burger on their menu, chopped up and put into fresh mixed greens. I like that they are thinking about the health conscious, low-carb crowd. Service was excellent too!"}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas! They have a huge selection of different cups sizes and designs...yummy  margaritas flavors as well. 
The bartenders were very friendly and attentive.  Stop by and get your dranks ;)"}
{"text":"I thought the wait would be longer since this location is on the strip but we got a table in about 20 min at dinner time. I was very happy with the cook on my burger and the Whalsauce made it even better! The tots and fries were very flavorful but they are kinda small so can't really share. 
I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"WE wanted burgers and shakes so we popped in and sat at the bar. Never heard of this chain and no, never watched the show. but don't fret, one of the flatscreens plays wahlberg only material, his bio, his career, his music, his restaurants. So if you don't know the wahlbergs, after 30min, i promise, you will. Oshee was our irish bartender and makes a mean milkshake, nice and thick. The sweet water blood orange beer on tap was refreshing and light! Had 2 pints. 
I ordered a burger with avocado, arrived rather quickly but I could not get over how SMALL the burgers were and GREASY. But we were hungry so we ate our small, greasy designer burgers and the milkshake filled us up. decent experience, we came back again for shakes which was interesting because, in the middle of the afternoon, they had a security guard at the door. They say its for sports fans who tend to fight during game season
.....frrigin bluejays!"}
{"text":"Walked in for a quick bite. Very impressive. Veggie burger was delicious. Sweet potato tots were fresh and hot. We told them we were in a rush, they had the food out to us in minutes. Servers were great even though we just grabbed it to go."}
{"text":"Not the greatest burger. Personally I think it's overhyped since it's Marky Mark's chain. Definitely had better burgers elsewhere. The bun to meat ratio is too big of a range (bun is too big) and my burger was served cold. Service was great with tons of good looking bartenders. Pretty much a good spot for eye candy not quite a good joint for burgers."}
{"text":"Went here after work around 7pm and sat at the bar. We were expecting average burgers not such a big deal right? Are you kidding me!? These burgers and everything else we got was AMAZING! Would recommend to anyone!!! Oh! And did I mention the service? Great service here everyone who worked at the bar checked up on us not just our server and they all looked happy to be there. We ended up tipping all of the people who worked at the bar because they were all working hard. Anyways, don't listen to the bad reviews give this place a try!!!! It's worth it"}
{"text":"Had the Our Burger. It was ok, nothing special.  It comes with zero sides, ordered a side of fries, they were ok.  The draft list only had 5 items.  Overall the portions are small, the food is fair and the decor reminds you of a McDonalds.  I'll not be back."}
{"text":"I have HIGHLY anticipated the opening of Wahlburgers... so much that I'd periodically go check the construction progress out! It's finally open!

I went there on their second day open at around 10pm and the wait was only 20 minutes (but took only 10 minutes). Each and every staff member was super friendly and helpful. They all went out of their way to make my daughter and I feel cared for (even the manager, Edgar). He personally came to speak to me to offer us each a complimentary frappe b/c they were out of Fluffanuttah ingredients. OMG, the frappes were so yummy. My daughter had vanilla and I had chocolate. She gave me some of hers... so I mixed the two together and viola... a party in my mouth!

It was late, so we shared Donnie's Fave (aka the BBQ Bacon burger) and the onion rings. Oh my jeezus... the flavor of the onion rings (more like onion strings with red onion) was super yummy, that they made my mouth water. The housemade BBQ sauce on the burger was filled with delicious spices (I LOVED it). The beef patty tasted like they used a higher quality of meat. The bun was slightly toasted and buttery. 

Overall, the service, the atmosphere, and the food were superb. I loved it so much that I'm trying to figure out how I can eat there once a week! J/K

*Be patient with the staff if you go b/c they are still learning, as they just opened a few days ago."}
{"text":"I loved this place and it was better than I expected. Let me state right now that I'm a fan of the show and I love the Wahlburg brothers. I'm still a New Kids fan and I loved Mark Mark when he front lines the Funky Bunch. I'm also a Boston Red Sox fan so I had to check this out. I went with my mom before the Jays/Red Sox game on 30/08/17 because we both were curious. And I'm glad we went. The staff were friendly and we were seated promptly as well as order drinks quickly. When we asked for recommendations, our waiter was more then happy to help. I chose to have their special The Smokin Burger with Sweet Potato Tots for a side. My ordered The Melt. We just went with gingerale and coke for drinks. Nothing  fancy there. Maybe because I had no expectations I thought the food was so good. I could just barely finish my burger. It was juicy and topped with yummy condiments - the hot sauce was spicy but not so much that it was unbearable; the caramelized onions added a sweetness to the burger, and the peameal was added a smoky flavour that I didn't find annoying (normally I dislike peameam bacon...yeah, I know). And the tots? Holy crap they were delicioius. Honestly, I could've just had those. Unfortunately, I can't speak for The Melt although it looked just as yummy. I took away a star because we had to wait when it got busy. Which I feel like they should be used to because it was game day and that whole area gets busy. Other than that, it was great. So try it if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Got the regular burger with fries . My boyfriend got the bbq bacon burger with avocado. He liked the avocado with the burger. It was a decent burger but I didn't like that they buttered the bun and made it all greasy. Despite the butter, i found the bun and burger dry for a gourmet burger shop. Overall it was ok but wouldn't go out of my way to come back. It felt more like a fad with all of the posters and videos featuring mark Wahlberg. Without his name, I doubt a lot of people will visit or return. Burger priest is still my fave!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and reasonably priced for airport fare. The Jenn's chicken burger was recommended by the waitress and it was good. My husband has the house burger and enjoyed it too. The tots were a bit overpriced from my perspective, for pre-frozen potato bites. We asked about dessert - the only option available was ice cream."}
{"text":"Ordered The Our Burger and fries.  Even though the burger was tasty and done perfectly, it was very small and not filling at all.  When I go back I will try a double or a sandwich.  On the plus side, we were seated immediately for lunch during a weekday, and the waitress was a hoot."}
{"text":"Went out to Vegas last week and I finally tried Wahlburgers. I had the \"the our burger\"  it was amazing! The service was also excellent, Rodrigo was our bartender. He made the best cocktails."}
{"text":"The food really isn't anything special, but the service was excellent. Our server Bianca took care of our group of 9 throughout the night and we wanted for nothing.

Burgers are decent, the tots are great. Onion rings are tasty but if you're expecting the big hearty A&W kind you're S.O.L. They are more shoe-string style and go well as a garnish to a burger.

Beer is totally over priced so I'd not recommend this place for a long night of drinking (which we inadvertently did). 18% auto-grat for everyone if you dine in - not just for large parties - which is unusual so beware of that as well. But, as I said, Bianca was awesome so it was a well-earned tip.

EDIT: we came here because we had visitors who watch Wahlburgers and wanted to check it out. Be prepared for screens pushing Wahlberg related content."}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference! I'm disappointed big time! Orlando was so much better than Vegas. What happened? Good took forever, burger was cold, sloppy joe is chili   on bread, chili was just chili. Fries was ok but cold. WTF! I guess mega mill n bunch of stores took the best out of this Plc. I'm so disappointed. Service is not that good either... Too bad, just too bad."}
{"text":"My first time at any Wahlburgers and I enjoyed it.  It's casual, fast foodie but the drinks were great and the burgers were a really tasty.  Definitely will make it back to another location."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 10 (including 3 children under 10) and waited an hour for seating -- understandable. However, we waited over an hour for 6 burgers, a salad, and three kids meals. When our food finally arrived, we were missing 2 kid meals, a burger, and a side. Therse items took another 20 min to arrive. An hour and a half for Kids meals? True, they comped the kid meals, and added desserts (which none of the kids had room for), but there was an attitude that we should not really be complaining. The food is good, but not spectacular. It's a burger joint - better than fast food but not better than other brgr places. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Well to start off, my 5 yr old grandson 
Is a picky eater! 
He loved the burger AND fries! 
Perfect size, he ate the whole thing :) 
As for the rest of us, we were pleased with all the fresh ingredients, house made sauces, tomato jam yum, and killer BBQ sauce. 
Burger patties cooked to perfection! 
Most important thing to me that can make or break a good burger is a stale BUN! 
Their buns where fresh, so soft throughout 
And toasty on the inner
Wish they had a Wahlburgers in Washington."}
{"text":"the burger was really good.! I give it 4 stars as I would not waste your money on the empanadas (even Taco bell makes better ones) also, was told the weight would be 30 mins so we grabbed a drink at the tiki lounge only to be called 15 mins later and asked to basically down our drinks before we entered the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was cold. Service was bad. Probably won't go back. Took waiter 3 times to get bill correct.  Confused due to sending cold tots back and saying I didn't want any more."}
{"text":"Despite the hit or miss reviews we decided to give this place a try! I'm glad we did! I think everyone should stop by and try it for yourself. Hopefully your experience will be as good as mine was. I got the Our Burger. The burger was great and I did request it to be cooked medium well! One thing that was frustrating was we all ordered onion rings, which were actually more like onion straws, and they come in a big basket that we could have split two or three instead of everyone buying one. They were also a bit cold. Service was average and prices to be expected for the strip. The restaurant itself is really nice and well put together and gives off a fun vibe. I did not like how they put our whole tables ticket together as one then acted like it would be a problem to separate it into the proper bills. So we had to divide everything up and figure out who had what. Pretty annoying."}
{"text":"Very expensive. My $13 burger was only worth $4 and doesn't include a side. A Coke is $3.95 and comes in a fast food style cup. An $18 beer comes in a clear plastic glass. It looks cool, but very cheap. The water doesn't taste right. The burger was good and I could understand it being $6-7, since they're located here, but $13 is insane."}
{"text":"Located between ballys and paris - was quite a walk to get to the restaurant.   Food was cooked well and yummy - but overpriced.    Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I got the mamas sloppy joe and it was INCREDIBLE! So flavorful and delicious and had a homemade feel to it. Tasted like my moms sloppy joe (but much better). Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to give this a try since we have heard so much good and bad about it.

Not sure why, but they stop you at the front door. There was a few people talking with the guy at the door. Mostly not about eating or getting a table, so we walked on in.

We were greeted by a less than happy hostess, she sat us right away and turned out to be our server. She took our order, never smiled, never said hello. Just \"what can I get you\"

The burgers came out fast and hot. They were about a 3 out of 5. Good flavor, but a soggy bun. The American cheese was ok, but a bit overwhelming. 

We also got the skinny onion rings. I'm sure when they are hot, they are good. But ours were Luke warm. 

$4 for a paper cup of Sprite...Ouch. I know it's the strip, but still...ouch.

While there, we noticed only one employee was happy, smiling and actually looked like he was enjoying his job. Everyone else looked absolutely miserable.

No desire to return, nor  would I recommend this place to anyone I care about."}
{"text":"Oh boy. Me b de suker.
Where do I start: hamburger is not special or tasty. Indeed it is small and fatty. It oozes oil. Oh no.
My friend had told me about their turkey burger but I guess it is removed from the menu since.
Price is high (I mean that), portion is small and taste is nada.
bye bye bye Wahlburgers bye bye byyyye"}
{"text":"Fast service, good burgers and fries. The poutine fries were a little be salty for my personal test. Other than that we have a good experience."}
{"text":"Loooooong waaittt ~45mins, we ordered our burger (they forgot the \"special wahl sauce\"), bbq burger (didn't forget the sauce but it was insufficient probably like half a teaspoon and a jalapeno slice), smahlburger. Fries was saggy by the time we got it, onion rings are good but not crispy when we got it (but it was good, better if hot and crispy). Kitchen was struggling I saw the kitchen manager/Prod.Ctrl dump around 10 burgers, and she was just giving it to every staff she can lay her eyes on. Staff was not attentive because they know they are behind and customers were angry. I hope they get better.."}
{"text":"Gave it a try, nothing special really except the name. Burger was good, atmosphere was okay and service was good. Price is Little pricey for a burger. Overall positive experience but don't expect something more than a fast food restaurant"}
{"text":"I was amazed that the women who seated us on Saturday night were not the friendliest hostesses. The place was packed and it seemed sorta confusing. Instead of a pager or PA system a women would go out into the lobby and yell a name. This added to the problem because people couldn't hear her and we're missed and when they asked about their turn it was too late other people had been seated. What a mess. Once seated things were just ok. The burger I had made the bread soggy and I ate it with a fork. I've had much better. The onion rings would have been ok if the weren't and Bunch of deep fried batter crumbs instead of onions. The sweet potato tots were very good. Waitress was very good and that was a bright spot. Other than those things I'd say it was a very mediocre experience. I probably won't go back for a while."}
{"text":"We eat a lot of burgers and usually unless there's something that stands out, I always prefer the ones I can grill up myself at home when you consider:
taste, price and value.  Wahlburger's was an exception to this.  Other than their completely ridiculous, overinflated prices on normal sides like tater tots and fries (that were served in a small cup for about $5 a piece), the burgers we had here were pretty great. Everything was so fresh and the bun was \"hamburger bun perfection\" (definitely worth not skipping the bun here).   I do have to say their thin sliced onion rings were worth their price- they were quite awesome and the portion size was much larger that the other 2 sides we all split.  I even added some on my BBQ burger, so good.  
Comparing the burger here to the other burger place we went to while on the strip, value, price and taste this is a place I would go again even at $12-13 a burger).  The food we had was definitely worth it.  One of the only burgers I've had out that left an impression as far as being pretty awesome.   Keep in mind this is a fast food joint on the strip, not an upscale fine dining experience- it can be quite noisy and busy."}
{"text":"Coming back here fasho! The Our burger was astonishing! Finished it in less then five minutes and I wasn't even high! Cheap and very affordable! Servers were great and always kept checking in if we needed anything. A1 service and great affordable food if you lose to much at casino and want a good meal. Come here lol"}
{"text":"Straight off a flight & open late enough for a family to grab a bite, Husband was ecstatic spotting their green sign lol as he's been wanting to try their burgers. Staff didn't seem too welcoming as we did kind of feel rushed to order & go. It was like 8:20pm & there were others dining in. 
Loved the sweet potato tots & the fries were on point. Their Whalbrewski was good, as was the Beast burger however I had to take out one beef patty b/c it was just too much to handle. My husband devoured his burger (I completely forgot which he ordered) in 4 bites under 8 mins so that pretty much hit the spot for him. Overall we enjoyed our first Wahlburgers experience & look forward to trying their other menu items in the future. This particular location though could move their trash bins they have on their side bar counter out of site as it was right by our table overflowing."}
{"text":"If you follow the show you definitely have to make a stop here. In my opinion there is nothing unique about it which is what I like. Its just a good burger spot. No frills, no hidden agenda just good atmosphere with a great burger. Pure and Simple just like family"}
{"text":"This was some of the best food I've had in Vegas or anywhere.  The funky monkey smoothie was so creamy and delicious.  The Mac and cheese was very good too.  We always try to go to different places while on trips but everything was so good we'll have to make another trip here before we leave."}
{"text":"Okay, had no idea this was a thing. Of all celebrities to have a restaurant chain, I think Mark Whalburg would have been the last one I would have guessed.
That aside, my husband and I would recommend the poutine, and the sweet tater tots were amazing. 
Bathrooms are on the second floor."}
{"text":"The food was great. We were told a 45 min wait and it ended up being 2 hrs. I would recommend getting it to go."}
{"text":"Everything we tried was great! 

Burgers, chicken sandwich, mac n cheese and onion rings. We also tried the Grilled Fluffanutta; Nutella, banana and peanut butter grilled sandwich. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I have tried to get into a Wahlburgers for years. I was always on the wrong side of Boston, and to be honest driving terrifies me there. We missed the opening of Coney Island by one week. So there was no way we were missing it in Las Vegas. I am happy to say it was well worth the wait! We had a short wait for a table, the hostess advised 20 minutes, when lucky for us it was actually probably only about 10 minutes. Fast with the drink and food orders. Our waiter was able to give some good recommendations, that did not disappoint. A girl will come around to take a souvenir picture, which i found a bit weird, but hey it's Las Vegas so we went with it. The tables are a bit close  on the patio and it can be a bit difficult to sit without bumping into someone as you are leaving. 

We get our food and let me just tell you, the patty melt is AMAZING!! Best one I have ever had. The beef was excellent. Government cheese, I am a fan. :) Way to go Elma and Paul!  I ordered the onion rings, not realizing how big the portion was. Very tasty! My husband knew he wanted the sloppy joe with tater tots and cheese since he had seen this on the tv show years ago and had his mind set on it. Once again they did not disappoint. The serving of the tater tots was just like my onion rings, way too much food. We will know for next time! Which there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Let me just say, the local management and district manager have been overwhelmingly apologetic for the action of 1 rude waiter. I really appreciated that they took the time out to call me and listen to what happened. Hopefully, he is in a position that suits his personality better. 
The last time we are here, the food was great and the beer was cold... it's an exciting crowd and you might have to wait but have a drink at one of the bars, back in this fun little cove.... it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"First, I would recommend using the no wait feature on here. Went here on a Sunday night and got put on the wait list. Got a table pretty quick though. I got the Our Burger. It was very good. Kinda like a less greasy five guys with Big Mac tasting sauce. I would go back for the sweet potato tots. Fresh out of the fryer and crispy. Positive experience and a place I would recommend despite only 3.5 stars on here."}
{"text":"I got the \"Our Burger\" for take out - which if I remember correctly it consisted of lettuce, tomato, pickles, patty and some sauce....

How can you call yourself a burger joint when you eff up the patty?!! It was OVERCOOKED, there's a difference between medium cooked and still juicy vs OVERCOOKED and dry af. The same thing happened to 2 of my other coworkers as well so it didn't happen to just me. Not going back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a four star restaurant. Best burger I have ever had. The sweet potato tits were out of this world and the bacon mac n cheese was mouth watering."}
{"text":"Food was good, location is clean and bright. I had the our burger with a fried egg. They asked how you wanted it cooked, and I got it a perfect medium rare. The Tater tots we're probably the best I have had in a retaurant. Josh was my server, friendly and prompt. The only glitch was the drink service. It took forever for the beer that I added when the meal came out to be brought to the table. I actually finished my meal before it arrived. Josh saved the whole experience by comping both of my beverages. Great customer service! I will be back before I leave Cleveland."}
{"text":"I very disappointed by my experience tonight at Wahlburgers. I ordered Our Burger, and fries. We waited over 40 mins for our food. My Burger was suppose to be med well, when I got it it was cold,  very red inside with red juices, my fries were stale and cold. They were the size of a Kids Happy meal fries, except these cost 4.95. We did mention to waitress and she said that they could remake, but after waiting 45 minutes for table and 40 minutes for our food there was no way I was sending it back. I did send the fries back. The people on the side of us left with out eating their food and the people behind us had a  problem with their order as well. I hope they can get their act together."}
{"text":"Ok so I went knowing this was a tourist trap, but doesn't anyone? Showed up and it was packed, they had a seat at the bar, we took them and the bar staff was great. The only draw back was the air blower that was going made it almost impossible to hear at times. The service was great, food was great, loved it, I would go back again to eat! It was one of those places to say you went, but it actually is great food!"}
{"text":"Went to the Toronto location before making the long drive back home. My buddy wanted to go and since we don't have any back home I was game. I did see the first episode of the show so it worked as an hour long commercial I guess.

The restaurant has an interesting setup. In the front (bar area) you have a typical sit down service restaurant, but in the back is an order counter where you can get your food \"fast food\" style. We sat at the bar where there was various sports on the multiple TVs in the area. Most had on Soccer and Baseball, while a few were dedicated to showing clips from the Wahlburgers TV show. Other than that there wasn't a ton of Wahlberg memorabilia. 

The food was good. Was it the best burger I've had? No, but it was still a pretty good burger. I got the melt which was on two slices of thick cut toast, \"government cheese\" as they called it (American), and onions. As usual, I held the onion. I was a little surprised the burger was not cooked to order, it was just a medium well. It was still juicy though. Also, the bread did not get soggy which is a major bonus (talking to you Burgatory). 

Our bartender was the star off the show though. He was really talkative in a good way. Conversed with us, made recommendations, and was just all around pleasant and fun. 

Would I go out of my way to eat here, no, but wouldn't turn it down if someone suggested it either. A solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"We went a few weeks after opening. We had two kids who can't sit still for hours (5 people total), so we came at 4 pm for an early dinner. There was still a 20 minute wait. We ordered immediately to speed up our process but our food took forever. We all ordered burgers because it's Wal BURGERS. Our order wasn't difficult, maybe a no pickle here, a no special sauce there... the order came out completely wrong. And the waitress, who was actually very nice, had no idea what we ordered. Not only was everything wrong, but she just randomly handed out the food. Some people just took bites and then realized it wasn't what they ordered. It's flu season, people! No one wants to eat off of each other! And it's expensive enough and took too long to just order another burger. You would think that they might compensate us in some way but no. Other than a quick \"sorry\" we got nothing! Not worth the headache. We'll go to Burgatory for our burgers from now on."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out a Wahlburger heard about them from there TV show. While in Cleveland for business I had time to try that location out. I was treated to a very busy location, I ordered the the Fiesta Burger fries and onion rings. While the burger was tasty and the bun very fresh the fries were very much fast food style and nothing special. The onion rings were served very cool, reminded me of opening a can of pre made onion rings for cooking. Absolutely will not be ordering these again don't bother. The service was horrible, it took 50 minutes to get the burger order.  The bartender who served me was ok and comp'ted the order of onion rings but I don't think I will be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend watches the show so when we were in Vegas he had to make a stop in.  We came in at about 9:30pm and it was fairly busy but we got sat right away.  Our server was really polite and the service was fairly fast. The burgers were a little disappointing, a tad small and not a lot of flavor. Their special sauce was good but they only put a little bit on each burger, I wouldn't protest them loading it on the bun. The onion strings were really good and enough for two to share. Glad we went so we can say we have been there but not the best burgers."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever eaten. I had the our burger, bun was the best, good quality meat. The 2nd time I've been here and best service ever!! Order the 22oz beer and u get to keep the mug!!"}
{"text":"ONE OF THE BIGGEST TOURIST TRAPS ON THE STRIP!

If you don't mind paying $20 for a good burger and cold fries, this is the place for you.  If you don't mind eating without utensils and drinking from paper or plastic (even an overpriced beer) this is the place for you.

The name brings you in.  The quality of the food is decent; the quantity of food delivered degenerates the value.  The total experience keeps you from returning.  Wahlburgers, sadly, must depend exclusively on uninformed tourists.

As a local, I recommend many other outstanding burger-available restaurants on or near the Strip:   In-N-Out, Smash Burger, Five Guys, Holstein's, The Peppermill, Marilyn's Cafe-Tuscany

Save your money!"}
{"text":"No reason to complain here. 13 dollar bbq bacon burger. Side of sweet potato fries. Bar seat. Music, sports on the tv. Beer was a good IPA. Jalapeños required some water to help my watery eyes but that is not a complaint. I'd come here again. I came in expecting fast food but it felt very bar casual.

Oh yeah. I tried going to Gordon Ramsay burger before this and it was a huge line and long wait. No wait here. Thanks."}
{"text":"Food was good but seating is rough sometimes. Having to park in the Ballys parking lot then tryting to find your way to it is a challenge."}
{"text":"My husband and our 2 kids went there. We love that they use the no wait app. All of their food was amazing and reasonably priced, good portions. My husband had a double cheeseburger and it was super cheesy. I had the grilled chicken sandwich with onions and it was very tasty as well. The sides are good portions. My son had the Mac n cheese and it was SO good! We will be going back."}
{"text":"Our room wasn't ready yet so we decided to venture off on the strip for a bite to eat.  The fries a tots were crispy and fresh.  We got a macaroni with bacon appetizer to start.  This was my husband's favorite.  I got the double hot dog where you can add any topping from the list you want.  My husband got a burger.  Everything was good and the service was beyond wonderful!"}

{"text":"I'm sad.  Very sad.  I had high hopes.  If it weren't for the good service I wouldn't have any stars to give.  We went for dinner and it was a bad decision.  I ordered  their Wahlburger with bacon.  Our waitress asked how I wanted it cooked and I asked for Medium.  It took quite a while for our food to come.  The minute I saw the premade perfectly round burger patty my hope started drifting down the drain.  It had no flavor.  None.  It was also WELL DONE.  IF it had any flavor it was cooked out.  The lettuce was shredded like the paper you put in decorative baskets.  It was green but it was wimpy, almost soggy.  It added nothing to the burger.  I CAN say that the house made Ranch dressing that I dipped my almost cold fries in was the best part of the meal.  IF that is the best thing you can say then I think that speaks volumes."}
{"text":"Well i went here to see what the fuss was about....we got seated pretty fast and the was the fastest of all the service! We finally got someone to take our drink order which was a soda and a beer, the soda came after 5 mins but had to wait for another five for the beer....which was a canned beer and a thin plastic cup so your beer gets warm fast...so i thought the waitress that took our drink order was going to take our food order but she left and never came back. Finally a new waiter came after waiting 15mins took our order, 2 burgers and a order of onion rings...well we waited for another 30 mins for our food to finally get to us by another waiter. The food was good...the burgers are small but good not the best...dont know if worth the price 45 dollars for 2 burger a side of onion ring a soda and a $5 beer...oh by the way a waiter neer comes back for refills on your soda you have to go get it yourself...so really no need to tip...i might give another try but not first on my list"}
{"text":"Stopped in this afternoon and order the mom sloppy joe burger  and two burgers. This was the best fresh  food ever. Always watch the show on TV. I wanted to enjoy the atmosphere. The bread was fresh Family oriented. You must stop in and try fresh fries and a sweet potato tots was a little sweet for me but the rest of the family enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The \"BBQ Bacon\" is ridiculous. The avocado spread makes for an odd, but delicious combination. So much so, I came back the next day and had two more."}
{"text":"We had supper this evening at Wahlburgers ... it opened about a month ago.

As you come in the door, you are warned you may be videotaped or recorded.

There are lots of signs relating to Mark and Donnie Wahlberg.

We both ordered Our Burger and a side of fries.  The burger and fries were good.  The bun, while nice and soft, needs some work.  The top bun was hot while the bottom bun was cold.  Plus the top bun wasn't substantial enough.

As a head's up, they have dropped the automatic 18% gratuity ... now it's only on parties of six of more.

Asma took good care of us.

If I was in that area and wanted a burger, I'd stop in again."}
{"text":"Horrible service and very slow times to get your food!! The Burger itself, while did taste good, was over priced and small! The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the food did actually taste good, but the service is just horrible!!! I even saw a group of people get up and leave because no one bothered to take their order. We sat at the bar for a solid 15 mins waiting, when there were 3 bartenders running around like they had no idea what they were doing! We loved the City of Toronto and can't wait to come back, but we won't be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Holy Cow that's a great burger! I am a turkey burger connoisseur and this restaurant hit it out the park! Freshly ground beef, not a patty, seasoned to perfection! My tummy is very happy! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went to Walburger for a new experience. Was in the mood for a good burger. Nice place, decor In green. Full bar. Lots of tables and tv screens. Nice ambience. Close to the entertainment district. Unfortunately the burger fell short of what I expected. I had to send it back as it was not warm. The onion rings were greasy and the fries where good. I got a new burger it was better. Management was nice and did not charge me for my fries. 
Would I go back? Not worth the drive from  Richmond Hill. Maybe if they added more burgers to their menu and I was in the area I may give them a second try."}
{"text":"The other reviews are right. Not a very good place and for $10 a burger, there are many better options in the city. 

The burger was not juicy at all and rather boring. It felt like I was eating a burger king whopper and the BK whopper is better. Worker's also don't wear hair nets... Hard pass."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience for our first time visiting Wahlburgers - Our bartender Vinny definitely made some excellent suggestions such as The Melt, Wicked Wahlburger, Spiked Lemonade, spiked cucumber and the banana fluffanutta haha. 

I would easily be back here for another visit ;)"}
{"text":"Overrated! $5 for Tater Tots that are the same as the ones you make at home. Burgers are good but nothing special. Staff can be a little friendlier, specially the bartenders!"}
{"text":"food - 7.5
service - 8
atmosphere - 7

the food here is pretty good great service just wish the food wasnt so pricey."}
{"text":"Mmmm..  burger joint.

Took absolutely no time for me to settle on getting an \"eh? burger\" and a poutine.   After all, I'm Canadian, eh?

Last year, I learned that if a burger has an egg on it, order that burger.  Hence, the \"eh?\" burger.

This \"eh?\" burger is, by far, one of my top 5 (if not top 1) burger of all time.

If you've never had a burger with a egg on it, you haven't lived.  Lift the bun, poke the yoke and let the yoke ooze all over the burger.  Replace bun, and enjoy.

The poutine was also excellent.

Nice looking place, lots of tasty options on the menu.  Go get an \"eh?\" burger - I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Wahlburgers. There was no wait - sat at the bar. The service  was extremely fast. I asked the Bartender (Vinny) for his recommendation as this was my first experience. He suggested \"The Melt\". OMG THE BEST RECOMMENDED ever. The burger is a grilled on steroid. Super YUMMY! I didn't order any sides. However I did order Manzanita Mule, which I highly recommend. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I met a buddy here for lunch.  I tried to keep my mind open given the ridiculous hoopla around the A&E show and hype in general.

It's a much larger space than I thought.  There are two floors, a bar area, an open kitchen and lots and lots of very green chairs. 

TV's broadcast various sports programs but you can always be assured the Wahlberg montage will be in rotation which features the best of Donny, Mark and whatever the other guy's name is. 

The servers seem to forget they work in a burger joint in a tourist area and not a hole in the wall on Ossington. Just because you are wearing  black T-shirt, it doesn't mean you need to act like WE should feel privileged to be there.  At least the shirts aren't green though....

As for the food, the burger was good. I went with the Bacon BBQ.  The meat/bun ratio was good and the patty was an acceptable medium-well (although I really wasn't asked).  I liked the Wahl sauce and BBQ sauce, both of which I asked for on the side.

As for the sides, they were terrible.  The fries and tots were synonymous with something my daughters would heat up after school. 

It's good in that you can sit and have a beer with a burger and watch television which is a surprising rarity among many of the popular joints in the downtown core. That said, you can get a good microbrew as long as you want to pay at least $7 for it. It's a bit ironic considering their menu concept which promises a reflection of humble beginnings and government cheese. I'd think a Bud Light might be a better call.

The concept is a little confused.  It can't seem to decide if it wants to be a chic burger bar or a family joint where you can get food made by famous people at a somewhat reasonable price. My guess is that Wahlburgers will likely draw the baseball crowd more than it will the patrons of the SOHO.

I think I could replicate my experience with a green sharpie highlighter, a pound of hamburger, a Kraft single, a bag of McCain fries/tots and a toaster oven while   watching Muchmusic retro while I talk to my annoying hipster cousin on speaker phone.

Stuck between 2 and 3 stars but the burger saved it.

With burger joints like Burger's Priest and P & L burger in town, I think this new kid will get knocked off the block pretty quick."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm a big fan of the Wahlbergs, so this was a must try. I'd heard nice things about it, so it didn't hurt that our room at Bellagio looked out at their sign on Bally's. I really thought I'd be ordering a burger, but seeing that they had a Sloppy Joe on the menu, I went for that. I am so glad I did! It was wonderful. Not as sweet as the stuff you get in a can, it had a nice tang to it. It was piled high on the bread and topped with wonderfully thin, fried onion strings. The homemade pickles were DELISH!! My companion had the Our Burger and said it was good, too. We were stuffed, just with those. We decided against spliting an order of fries when we saw how huge that was. 

The atmosphere is great, you feel like it is your home town diner."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and staff were knowledgable.

Burgers were on point!! 

Everything on the menu looked so yummy I struggled to decide.

I had the \"Eh\" burger. It was so so good. Meat was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the peameal bacon, egg and other toppings complimented each other very well. Love the mustard sauce in there!

Sides were also yummy, tater tots, fries and the onion rings (not your standard thick round onion rings but instead thin, strip like onion pieces) a nice variation and surprisingly good.

Friend had the Thanksgiving burger which he said was great and a nice change from the usual. 

Highly recommend if you are looking for a quick easy, no fuss meal."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place in Vegas by any stretch of the imagination. 
First, the setup is weird. You are seated and have a waiter but people can come in and order form the register up front. Our server kept forgetting about us and it took forever to get anything (probably about an hour).
You can turn any of the burgers or sandwiches into a salad so I did that with their chicken salad. Instead of salad dressing they put the weird mayo all over the salad. That's pretty vile. The mac and cheese was weirdly runny and there werent any cool dipping sauces for the fries or tator tots. I'll hard pass on this place next time."}
{"text":"We went to Wahlburgers in Las Vegas the first time and liked it so much that we searched for it back in East Coast! Yep, we're that kind of crazy when it comes to food! Lols
I thought the menu is slightly different between the East and West Coast but they still have the Wahlbergs' family favorites ie: Mom's Sloppy Joe, the Our Burger and the single, double and triple burgers. Tried almost each type of the burgers and they're all pretty consistently good! Juicy and tender! I just wish they're a little bigger on the size.

Service for the LV location was excellent! Super friendly and very attentive staff. Being it's a tourists destination, they offers guests to have their picture taken and put it in a souvenir frame. But I think it's a third party that take the pictures since the pictures are not free. But feeling tourist-like, we bought the picture.

Ohhhh, when you're there, do NOT miss their thin crispy onion rings!!! It will be a sin if you don't get this crazy-good thin crispy onion rings! It's not the ordinary onion rings. I think they should be called onion strings instead of rings. They are thinly sliced strings tangled and fried all together in a delicious batter. Did I say you have to get the onion rings? 
Hahahaha it's definitely one of major factors why I had to find a Wahlburgers back home.
Definitely recommended! Oh, try the onion rings!"}
{"text":"Great burger and onions straws!


Right in the strip.... you can take your beer with you as you walk the strip!!


Must go!"}
{"text":"This is totally not worth the money. The concept is good but actual delivery is not. $34 for two burgers, onion straws (not rings) and a drink. Asked for crispy bacon, almost gagged on the raw chewy meat delivered. Asked for gluten free bun, no such luck and had to eat bunless. Burgers were dry and kind of boring considering the toppings. And 10-15 minutes stretched to almost 30 when the forgot to cook the onion things. Even at an airport you could do so much better. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed this was on my bucket list huge   Wahlburgers fan the food was great a lil pricey and small portions but that's to be expected. The customer service was awful from start to finish. The hostess was rude my mother in law is in a wheelchair and was hot we asked for a water while we waited for our table no one would get us one when we got to our table the waitress was there quickly but was in a hurry to take out order I didn't even get a chance to look at the menu before she was hurrying me to place my order once our food was delivered never saw her again had to ask someone else for the check. While a bunch of the staff was huddled in the corner talking happy to say I've eaten there but won't be going back which is disappointing because I was really looking forward to a positive memorable experience not a sad one still love wahlburgers"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Wahlburgers for the obvious reasons...the celeb owners and TV show. It did not disappoint! The prices are so reasonable...$8 for a decent burger. Burgers, fries, tots, onion rings, Mac n cheese were all delicious! Def try the sauces...wahl sauce and Jens sauce both had great flavor. The service was wonderful, waitress was super friendly! We got our food pretty quick which was a plus. I put our name on the waitlist through the yelp app before we arrived so we only had to wait about 10 minutes once we got there. Oh and get a cupcake, one of the best cupcakes I've had. All in all, I was impressed and will def go back."}
{"text":"Was weary because of the low ratings, but was literally around the corner from Soho Metropolitan. Close by, and open late until midnight. 

Busier and nosier mix of tables/booths closer to the bar, doors open so you can get fresh air while you eat, but still technically indoors. Closer to the register are more booths and tables that are usually empty and therefore more quiet. Some large TVs there as well -- tonight happened to have a reel of Donny and Mark Wahlburg, and some of their family. 

We did takeout a couple times, and service was always so fast. Both nights we waited 10 minutes. Plenty of condiments, utensils, napkins to help yourself to. Beats having to ask someone to give you adequate amounts of those things. Guy manning the register was friendly when taking our order and patient when I got confused with their current menu versus the online one

Most of the food was really good :

Our Burger- This comes with Wahl sauce? Not sure what that is, but all I saw was melted cheese. There was no other discernible taste of said sauce. It suited me because I like a basic standard burger without any fancy dressings or sauces to gussy it up.This was a great burger, always hit the spot. Patty not too thin, not too thick, and was the proper ratio with the toppings/bun. It's not a large burger/patty, definitely not the size of a diner or Chili's burger.

Hot dog- Couldn't really mess this up. They gave the tiniest ramekin of sauerkraut. 

Grilled cheese with tomato and bacon - lots of cheese, gooey, and buttery bite. Had chopped up bacon pieces rather than strips inside. 

Chicken fingers - Doubt these were made in house, but three very large flat strips of chicken without thick breading so it was mostly chicken and thus very filling. 

Crispy haddock sandwich - crispy as stated, not soggy or greasy, but barely any flavor because they were either too stingy with the sauce or the sauce had no actual flavor. Hard to tell because there was so little of it. 

Tator tots - Always crispy on the outside. Perfect crunch, but then soft inside. 
Yukon Gold fries -- day to day, the size of the fries varied. Once they were thinner, the next day fatter, but wider. The latter seemed fresher and crisper, whereas the previous batch was darker, as if they used old oil. 

Have a small selection of cupcakes by the register. Honestly, one of the best cupcakes I've ever had and they only had one chocolate left the first night. Chocolate frosting was buttery and rich yet light and whipped in texture. Super moist cake. I wasn't able to get it again after since they seem to buy more vanilla based flavors and in small numbers, like 3 per flavor."}
{"text":"Obviously you can't have a burger without a beer! Pint of Mill Street organic went down really well with the \"Our Burger\"... a 5oz burger, lettuce, onion, \"government\" cheese, Paul's signature sauce & HOUSEMADE pickles ( got them on the side).  The bun is a potato bun so when you get down to the last bite...there is still lots of flavour in the bun!  Tater Tots - can't go wrong with them \"Tots\" (Napoleon, give me some Tots!). Overall, exceeded expectations.

Great service, great atmosphere, great meal - simple, filling and tons of flavour.

I will definitely be back and recommend to any and all.  Price is very reasonable as well. 

Awesome!"}
{"text":"WHO: The hubs and I :)

WHAT: Dying to get out of the 104 degrees of the Vegas Strip.

WHEN: This past Saturday!

WHY: Because I had a massive crush on Marky Mark as a kid. DUH!

Over the weekend, the hubs and I decided to try the famous \"Wahlburgers \", as we were both in need of a meal after walking the strip and day drinking. Upon walking in, we were greeted by a young face and lead to a booth close to the bar. We dove into the extensive menu before deciding on sharing \"The Our Burger\" which was loaded with a 1/3 lb of meat, lettuce, tomato, onion, american \"government\" cheese, Paul's signature Wahl sauce with housemade pickles! Ben likes his burgers plain and simple, where I like to make mine all fancy and loaded up with all the fixin's - so opted for onion rings on the side....which were pretty much onion strings! Everything tasted a little blah - and wasn't outstanding by any means The meat was pretty dry and literally was nothing to write home about. Service was decent and pricing wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.

#sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"Great experience - food, service, and price!  It seems like the Wahlbergs have addressed growing pains (training, service, food quality, etc) that other reviewers of this location mentioned.  If you're on the fence about trying this place out like I was because of the reviews, take a leap of faith.  You're missing out on a great burger and Yukon fries (among other items I need to come back to try) otherwise."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars, because of the atmosphere and service. The food was not great and it was way over priced. Drinks were 5$ ,burgers do not come with fries.   
I got a side of mac and cheese for 8$ it came in a little cup. It had no flavor at all, noodles with flavorless cream sauce.  Fun to try, won't do it again. Side note the blue cheese sauce is really good."}
{"text":"This place has good food but is extremely overpriced for the portion sizes. If the burgers came with fries then that would make up for the expensive burgers. However, the service was really good."}
{"text":"While the place is new and cool... the food is overpriced and underwhelming. I did have a  Pretty decent fish sandwich there the last time I was there but the $3.50 side and $3 drink ruined that pretty quickly. I would rather go to denny's.  If you want to be dazzled by décor and don't care much for food quality or prices... this is your place. The staff is nice for now but that will  Change for the worse with time."}
{"text":"The burgers taste so fresh! I got the original Our House Burger and it was excellent. Made to order upon request. Would definitely come back and would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Was skeptical about trying this place based on reviews, but I must say I'm glad we did. Food was good but service was great would definitely try again. Also drinks are really good and strong be prepared for a wait it does get super busy but definitely a good spot."}
{"text":"Was excited to come here but was very disappointed ordered a bbq bacon burger and got no bbq sauce and our fries were stone cold won't be coming here again"}
{"text":"As a local I hate driving to the strip but as a fan of the TV show I was excited to visit. First thing is getting to The restaurant is not easy and having to walk through Ballys you realize just how dirty the casino is. I got to the restaurant at 11 sat at the bar ordered a beer number one they came in a plastic cup like I'm at a ballgame  instead of a restaurant. I ordered the Donnie burger and fries, the Donnie Virga came rare when I ordered it medium the fries were undercooked. I asked the bartender may please have some silverware and some napkins she brought me a plastic fork and plastic knife to go with my plastic cup of beer. Although I am a big fan of the show this restaurant is horrible"}
{"text":"First time here, the O.F.D burger is AMAZING!!! The bacon is crisp, the patty was cooked just right, the mushrooms and the Swiss cheese are a perfect compliment! I was a little afraid of the tomato jam, but it works! Great service, cool vibe, highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This was an okay place. Had to wait a bit as this is the new kid in town. Thet had buzzers and some games outside in the hall. I wanted a burger, no bread. The waitress suggested a salad. Turned out it was a good suggestion. My partner had a burger. Portions were generous. While the food was nice, it was nothing exceptional. Service was good."}
{"text":"Ok so why not, it's not a burger joint we have in Fla, and it's by the Whalburgers, so .. again I ask you, Why not?

We opted for out door seating as the afternoon was quite nice, and it allowed us a chance to people watch. I chose the sloppy joe - no whalburger sauce. the boy chose some other burger to his liking, a drink for each and fries to share. 

The service was good, infact quite fast, what I didn't enjoy was the person who wanted to take our \"free picture\" that just annoyed me . 

The food was tasty, I loved the Sloppy Joe, and managed to eat it without getting any one me, That's a huge feat, you have no idea!  The Scotsman was a member of the clean plate club so yeah we liked it. We'd come back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We were going to get a table. There was a 30-45 min wait not too bad considering it was 5:30. We sat at the bar to wait for the table but decided to eat at the bar instead. At first the two bar maids were a bit slow to get us drinks. But the 5 or so min wait was well worth it. They both were very nice and attentive. I am one I don't want to wait forever for a drink. They made sure I was not waiting for my next drink. My wife and I both got burgers she got a single and I did the double. We got fries and onion rings. The food was really good. We both really liked the onion straws. The fries were not the best but were just ok. We will definitely be back. The surprising thing was it was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a casual lunch or dinner.  We avoided a hour-ish wait by checking making a reservation on Yelp beforehand, which really helped the overall experience.  The location was smaller than I had expected, but we were seated within a few minutes.  The burgers are very nice sized - a burger and a shared order of sweet potato tots were enough to leave my wife and I stuffed.  I got the OFD, and really enjoyed the burger.  The meat was well seasoned and the tomato jam was amazing.  I got the jam on the side, and it made a perfect dipping sauce for the tots.  The prices are great, and the burger stacks up well against many of the higher priced burgers I've had throughout the city.

Go in with realistic expectations, and you won't be disappointed.  This is a great casual burger in an convenient location with a price that's tough to beat."}
{"text":"Took my adult sons here for a quick bite prior to our show. I had the sloppy joe..... thought I was in literal HEAVEN !  Served open faced with cheese and special sauce!  YUMMM!  I will DEFINITELY be back"}
{"text":"Honestly for it to be a whalburgers and the 8$ milk shake to be in a plastic cup. I have to say I was surprised. Burger was like any other."}
{"text":"I happen to be at The Container Store and noticed Wahlburgers as I was driving by so I thought why not! I had the option of sitting at the bar, in the dining room or on the balcony; and since the weather was so beautiful I opted for the balcony. My waitress Chatara was excellent. Super friendly and very attentive throughout the meal. She asked if it was my first time there and proceeded to tell me some of her favorite things off the menu, I ended up going with the sloppy joe that she recommended and also a side of sweet potato tots.  The food came out really quickly, I was actually quite surprised. The sweet potato tots came in a little cardboard bowl and the sloppy joe filled up the plate along with some slices of pickles.  All of the food tasted great. The sloppy joe was actually very mild in flavor, so if you are someone who is used to eating Manwich sloppy joes the flavor on this is much less pronounced!  You could definitely tell that it was homemade. The crispy onion rings on top were a nice addition, as were the pickle slices. The cheese sauce and the wahl sauce we're also quite unusual I thought for a sloppy joe but gave it that something special. Wahl sauce is a mixture of ketchup, mayonnaise, sriracha, sauteed onions and parsley. The sweet potato tots were just as I expected, nothing unusual there. Overall, my experience at walburgers was a good one. I will definitely bring my husband next time. Hopefully I can try one of their adult fraps!  They also offer a 10% military discount."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! Service was great. Food came fast and I loved our souvenir photo. Bill, our server was cool and attentive. As a local I don't come eat on the strip very often but I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Seriously the best gluten free bun and burger I have EVER had!!! And they have a great understanding about cross contamination, my server has celiac and she eats here all the time. A must have when visiting the Vegas strip!!!"}
{"text":"These burgers are amazing!! The onion rings arent like regular ones they are thin strips like onion straw and they are the greatest thing ever!!"}
{"text":"The location is good, the layout inside is good, the food is good, food comes fast, menu is hard to follow.  Overall fun place"}
{"text":"Our waitress was a rude wannabe princess. She came to greet us, I asked her for a beer as my drink. She told me she'd rather get me the beer when everyone was ready to order food because \"the bar is far away\". My eating buddy asked for more water at one point and she said \"sir, that's gonna be a minute\" the hell?! We hadn't even taken a bite of our burgers and she had already dropped the check on the table. Okay so you don't want me to order more beer?? We were sitting directly in front of the kitchen and could plainly hear her berating the chefs with her special orders. Girlfriend you are not Tiana from Princess and the Frog."}
{"text":"I expected more - it was extremely hyped.  I got the Mom's Sloppy Joe and onion strings.  The onions were so small they should have been eaten with a fork, difficult with hands.  The sloppy joe was on white bread.  WHITE.  BREAD.  I know you have buns, I see burgers everywhere, whyyyyyy?  On top of that it was greasy and I couldn't eat much.  The service was quick, the drinks were good, but I don't think I would ever go back."}
{"text":"The wait was long. Then sat down 3 people asked for our drink order. Then order our food. The forgot my son's sauce. My burger was dry and no sauce on it. My husband's burger they forgot the bbq sauce, fries were cold and hard, my daughter's mac and cheese had no cheese on it. Very disappointed. We needed refills never was asked about it. If the family knew how bad it was they would change things. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This was hands down one of the best burgers I have ever had! I never liked onion rings until I tried the ones here. They we're amazing. The beer was also hands down the best I have tried. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Our burgers were good and I loved the sweet potato tater tots. Sit outside if you can, it's a fun place to be. Our service was wonderful and the food came in a timely manner. Our waitress told us to have the burgers just as they are and she was right."}
{"text":"I have no idea why the rating average is so low, this place is off the charts! The burgers were great, there's a ton to choose from both food and drink wise. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I saw some of the previous reviews. 
This is vegas. Everything costs more! 

I had the O.F.D burger and the onion strings. Both were REALLY REALLY good! I'll definitely be back. Love the family, love the TV show.....Love the restaurant!"}
{"text":"If I wasn't hungover AF, this place might have fallen thru my food radar. Luckily, the location was convenient to my hotel across the street and I got what I needed to recover from a night of funnn. The food is hearty and good. The atmosphere is clean and new. The waiter was snarky, but in a good way. I'll be a return customer next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This was probably the biggest letdown of a burger/hotdog I have ever had. My fiancée and I are staying at the Bellagio with a fountain facing view. We noticed the Wahlburger sign from our room and I, a burger enthusiast, was excited to be able to try it. We went for lunch/dinner yesterday and both were starving so it should have been easy to please us. I ordered a double-Wahlburger w/ chs and two hotdogs with Ketchup/Mustard/Onion. My fiancée got the seared chicken sandwich. Food didn't take too long to come out, which was the only pleasant part about our venture here. The chicken sandwich, which I had a bite of, had a awkward texture and mouthfeel about it. Almost as if it had a 20%+  water-solution pumped into it. The condiments on the sandwich were decent but he chicken itself just was well below standard. Next, the hot dogs... the worst part of the meal. I eat a lot of food and two dogs and burger is nothing. I only ate one. Bad, over cooked dogs in stale bread - just not worth it at all. The burger was ok. Nothing I would ever crave and was sad because In-N-Out burger was so close by. I'll never be going to a Wahlburger again."}
{"text":"Probably the worst overpriced piece of meat I've ever purchased. The worst dining experience that I've ever had to be honest. I can't believe the prices they make you pay for the below average burger. You might as well go to in n out to get 10x the dining experience I received. Hope you're ready for undercooked raw patties because that's what you're going to get. Better eat somewhere else besides this food joint. I'd rather pay for an all you can eat buffet. Unfortunately that's not available at 11pm at night in Vegas. So unfortunate for such a promising burger joint."}
{"text":"I had to try Wahlburgers and see if it was actually any good. I walked inside to the counter and placed an order to go (since there was an hour wait to sit). I ordered a cheeseburger with the \"special sauce\", and a side of sweet potato tots. When I got back to my hotel room, I had a cheeseburger and onion strings... whatever, accidents happen. The cheeseburger was nothing special, kind of blah. There is a lot of hype over this place, but I would take a burger from In-n-Out any day over another Wahl-burger. Sorry, Marky-Mark."}
{"text":"This Wahlburgers was a long time coming!!! After anxiously awaiting its opening, today was the day!! Since the grand opening isn't until January, today's opening wasn't advertised so it was nice to experience the environment of the restaurant without all the chaos of a full dining room. Our server was amazing. I tried the white wine sangria (which she recommended) which was a great blend of fall flavors you don't usually expect in a sangria. To eat, I got the sloppy joe and chili cheese double dog (actually a double decker hot dog!!!) with a side of sweet potato tots - I had to try as much as possible because I just couldn't make up my mind! I loved the idea of a sloppy joe at a restaurant and this one did not disappoint! It was open-faced and topped with onion straws and cheese  The chili cheese double dog not two separate chili cheese dogs, but instead one giant chili cheese dog with 3 pieces of bun and two whole hot dogs! It was a challenge to finish after the sloppy joe but I'm always up for the challenge!! The sweet potato tots were a perfect addition, and I would definitely recommend adding them to whatever you decide to try!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Love them!! They need to come to los Angeles, San Fernando Valley, CA . love mark Wahlburger"}
{"text":"They could only sit us outdoors so we could watch our game. Wouldn't change the TV so we could sit inside and enjoy the meal and game. Had a fricken wind tunnel to sit in. Couldn't turn off the fan for us. Finally the manager moved us into the restaurant to eat without the wind tunnel cooling off our food too much. Food was good but not worth the poor experience.  Very loud and pricy.   Beer was cold - for what that is worth. Should expect that in 2016!!"}
{"text":"After a 2 hour and 15 minute wait I was very anxious to try the food here. I got a double decker and added bacon and egg. It was very solid and comparable to Red Robin and Burgatory, but not as good as BRGR. Got mine with a side of tater tots which were good. Prices were reasonable and service was very solid and food cane-out fast. Burger wasn't that big, but it filled me up perfectly. Came well done and I would go back. Hopefully wait isn't that bad next time."}
{"text":"Loved my food. Definitely going back before leaving Vegas. Yum!! My burger with government cheese was excellent. My fries were perfect."}
{"text":"Just another burger place. Not great, but not bad either. When we first got there, they stated that the wait would be between 30 to 45 minutes. I saw about 4 or 5 tables that were not occupied. Why such a long wait when there appears to be open tables? Are they reserved? Do you not like the way I look? I wanted to ask, but I figured since a few friends are with me, I didn't want to make a scene. After about 30 minutes, we got seated. I ordered \"The Our Burger\". It had lettuce, tomato, onion, their signature wall sauce, and pickles. There wasn't too much sauce on my burger, which I appreciated. The sauce was flavorful and added a nice touch to the burger. I also ordered the Yukon gold fries, which were good. 

They have a bar area with several flat screen TVs and seating both inside and outside. The service was poor. It must have taken over 40 minutes to receive our food from the time we ordered. Once we finished, it took awhile to receive our checks. I do not think they were appropriately staffed with the amount of customers in the restaurant. There was a concert going on at the stadium nearby, so I don't think they were quite ready. The burger market is saturated, and although the wall sauce was good, it wasn't enough to really differentiate themselves from the other burger chains. There's only so many different ways you can make a burger."}
{"text":"Great burger. Got the OFD (Originally From Dorchesta), medium rare, and cooked perfectly. Super juicy, with mushrooms and cheese. 
Sweet potato tots were good with the cranberry sauce. Tots could have used a bit of salt/seasoning and the burger would have benefited from a slice of tomato or lettuce but very good otherwise."}
{"text":"Had the impossible burger which was 18 bucks. We ordered them medium but they were well done. Fast and friendly service. Short wait. The end."}
{"text":"Ok Mark.  The wait time of 1.5 hours was well worth the wait for the delicious onion rings and burgers.  The only complaint I had was the hotdogs had a very funky taste to them.  My seven year old brought it to our attention.  And it definitely needs to be addressed.  Other than that.  It was a wonderful experience to visit your establishment while visiting Las Vegas on our 10th Anniversary."}
{"text":"Awesome food an great service... im so glad i came here.! Food is to die for.. idk wat else to say get here.!!"}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the Impossible Burger, a newish vegan burger.  It's not on the regular menu yet, but it's on the napkin dispenser display. 
It's not cheap - $19, and comes with no sides, and I got a Diet Coke which was $5 (with a plastic souvenir cup), plus tax and tip, so my whole meal was $30.  Not cheap, but it's Vegas, and I was willing to pay a little more to try the new vegan burger. 
The display shows that the burger comes with special sauce (with mayo - not vegan), and cheese, and sauteed onions (not sure what they are sauteed in and forgot to ask).  So I asked for the burger vegan style, so they took off the sauce and the cheese, BUT the bun came with butter on it!  Also, not sure if the bun is vegan, and not sure if the onions are cooked in butter or oil, and not sure if they are cooked on the same grill as all the meat patties.  I ended up scraping off the buttered part of the bun with my fingers, and removing the onions, and adding some ketchup and mustard, and the burger was very tasty after that! 
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE that they are offering the Impossible burger and want them to keep doing that, but, please be aware that vegans may come to this restaurant to try it, and they will want the rest of the burger to be vegan as well - bun, toppings, sauteed onions, etc...  So it'd be great to educate the staff about these customers and make it so you can offer a true vegan burger, and include the details on the menu about it, from the top of the bun to the bottom.  The waiter did tell me that the burger is cooked on a separate grill, which I love.  Now you just have to offer the option to make the rest of the meal totally plant-based.  
Place was bright, service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"OMG I had the surf and turf burger and it was excellent! Cooked to a perfect medium rare. No one ever gets the temperature right, they always come out too cooked and dried out. The one thing I did not enjoy was the sweet potato tater tots. They were not crispy and some were not fully cooked. I hate bitting into a raw potato. If these had been cooked to a nice crisp I would have given them 5 stars.  I do recommend but if you order the tater tots  just ask for them to be more on the crisp side. They also have milk shakes with alcohol! Yum'"}
{"text":"Better burgers than you will expect. Highly recommend choosing tots as your side, they are cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"My husband is a fan of the show so we decided to try this place out since we were staying at Ballys already. We came on a Weds at 4:30pm, walked right in, greater by the hostess & we were seated with no problem. 

It does have a restaurant/fast food feel to it as the napkin dispenser & ketchup are on the side of the table (condiment packets where at the ticket counter in view but you had to ask for them?) & they bring drinks in to go cups. We had the Dad's basic burger which was pretty plain with just pickles, the wahl sauce & onions (we grilled ours) & split an order or thin crispy onion rings. The sides don't come with the burger, everything is pretty much separate & aren't meal combos. We thought our burgers were great! We had the chance to really taste the meat since we opted out of adding any toppings to our burgers. Also, I wasn't expecting the onion rings to be this way but we preferred them since regular ones are too breaded, these we're light, crispy & very tasty. 

Only thing was that we didn't really see our waiter, hostess was nice though & when we paid it was quiet confusing. Waiter gave us a receipt & immediately took off with no indication on what to do & if he was even coming back or where to take the receipt to. Luckily the hostess came up to us willing to help & took the receipt to the register herself. We will definitely be coming back thought."}
{"text":"Really quick and efficient service. We ordered the Our Burger and the BBQ Burger which were amazing and the Yukon fries are fantastic! We saw onion rings come out as we ate and they looked so good, next time we're definitely ordering them. Really cool decor, great vibe."}
{"text":"Omg! The Burger is awesome!  The Bun makes it! Great fries but it's the milk shake frappes  are delicious and leave me feeling nostalgic! Everything is reminiscent of the good old days, from the government cheese to the shakes! It's a fave!"}
{"text":"Love the show, the our burger is okay. Id prefer smash or fat Burger personally. Thought i would take my son and check it out. Location is terrible. Definitely not for locals. You have to go through two casinos to get there from parking. The sides arnt included. For me and my son the bill was 32$ bucks. Not worth the effort. And im a huge fan.....bummed"}
{"text":"Meh. Went the because we are fans of the TV show. And as much as Paul complains about wanting quality at the restaurant, I was surprised. We weren't hungry at all, but ordered something just for the experience. We ordered a party melt with bacon, tots and 2 drinks. Burger was greasy, tots were just tots. Nothing special anyone could make tots. How about some melted cheese, chives and a dollop of sour cream perhaps?  Cost was $25. One burger tots and 2 ice teas!  The capper of the experience was my wife had to use the restroom. It was outside of the restraint in the shopping village, where she ran into two individuals who took up residence in the ladies restroom for the day or week. She was not happy about having to dodge those two. Needless to say, she held it and we went elsewhere. It may not be fair of us to \"expect\" more from this experience, because we \"know\" the Walbergs from the show. I guess. But I won't go back. Sorry. Watch the show and save your dough. Hey, that rhymes."}
{"text":"The burgers were to die for. Very tasty and extremely juicy...perfect! I was highly impressed with the food!"}
{"text":"The veggie burger is sooo yummy! Great flavor, hearty and not full of fillers like rice, much yastier and heartier than the Beyond Burger.  I could do without the chili tomato, so I sub for a reg. $18 is a bit high, but this is the Las Vegas strip. Ate a burger everyday for the past 3 days! 

Order beer, shots or something off their menu, off menu drinks are poorly missed and not too tasty (i.e. dirty martini)."}
{"text":"Great casual spot for a low-key burger and fries meal! I enjoyed my meal here. Wahlburgers offers a quality meal and adequate service relative to the price. I'm not sure why others have given this spot low reviews. This is simply a fun, affordable, casual cheeseburger spot - its just not a gourmet or speciality burger spot. 
Atmosphere is clean and casual. Service was friendly. Walhburgers surprisingly offers a diverse menu with lots to choose from. Food was definitely enjoyable, what I expected for the price. 
I was only disappointed that they did not have onion rings at 6 on a saturday night :( I really wanted to indulge in those."}
{"text":"I have been excited to come here ever since I started watching the show. The food was amazing exactly what I expected from a backyard BBQ kind of place, and the service was great. I had The Our Burger and my husband had The Fiesta Burger we split a side of tater tots. Loved the house made dill pickles and the freshness of all the toppings."}
{"text":"Had to try this restaurant out but wasn't too impressed. Was really hoping to be blown away. I got the bbq bacon burger with two additional sides; sweet potato tater tots and thin onion rings. The burger was okay, I ordered medium well and and it was decent. The tots... I wouldn't order, little shredded sweet potatoes inside (I was hoping for a smooth center) but tasted much better dipped in ketchup and the onion rings were okay as well, thin and crispy. 

The best part is the location! Fun atmosphere. Music and bars adjacent. We sat outside because the weather was beautiful."}
{"text":"When I say the burger was cooked to perfection it was cooked by the burger gods themselves.

The staff was super friendly and the food comes out in a Boston minute which is about 5 minutes after ordering. 

The mac and cheese was good but a bit to soupy. 

The sweet potato tots with chili are a must try,the chili is well made and the tots taste like mini sweet potato bites.

I had the double decker minus the whal sauce and it was banging, prepared medium well topped with some of the best pickles I've ever tasted.

My fiance enjoyed the melt which she devoured within 4 minutes complementing how well it was cook and how great the mustard was.

Over we enjoyed our meal and would return only major downsize is the bathroom situation which is a good walk away if its needed."}
{"text":"Service was ok. The burger was ok. Not the best I've ever had. I didn't care much for the fries. Did not like the ranch dressing."}
{"text":"I really love watching the show and after I decided to visit Toronto I decided to make my way to Wahlburgers. First of all there is no public parking in the area. I had to pay $20 just to park to car to have a burger. Went inside and decided to do self service because the other side was full. There were an abundance of flies hovering over the food which is disgusting. Food isnt as good as they hyped it up to be. I can get better burgers elsewhere and definitely not worth going out of my way for."}
{"text":"We were excited to finally eat at Wahlburgers. We were seated promptly and met by sour server quickly. The assortment of beers was great, approximately 10 to choose from. Our server, Amber, was fantastic very helpful and knew the menu well. The hotdogs that I ordered seemed to b an afterthought by the chef, very boring and predictable. My wife had the Dad's Basic burger and really like it by adding mushrooms and blue cheese. The sweet potato fries seemed to be left over from an earlier batch. Overall it was just average. Wish I could have said better things, we love watching Mark in movies and have enjoyed the Wahlburgers show."}
{"text":"We went for dinner after being tired of paying $20-$40 for a bad burger in several high-end restaurants that advertise famous burgers. We waited for around 20 minutes outside and were then quickly seated. The restaurant is noisy as expected and the service staff could use some training in consistency as we rarely saw our waiter and there was no attempt to refill drinks even though they would refill one if asked but not offer to do others at the same table. The guy cleaning the tables was the most attentive person there. 

The burger wasn't bad at all and was probably one of the better ones we had during this trip. It isn't amazing but you can expect good meat, fresh vegetables and a decent experience. This is tailored more towards the fast-food side of eating and was $75.00 for three people. We got three burgers (Own Burgers), onion rings and fries. The onion rings were oddly dry and perhaps overcooked but we liked the thin cut style. Fries were generic but hot and crispy. We also tried the cupcakes which are very home-made tasting but in our case were very dry as well. 

Our only real complaint was the service and the pricing. We have been trained here in LV to expect and accept both bad service and high prices so maybe that was just par for the course.  We would return if we wanted a quick bite before a show. It is too bad that you have to pass so many naked people and crazies on the way there along the strip so if you are taking kids especially at night and walking there be aware of that issue."}
{"text":"Really friendly service, really fast and the food is delicious! Tastes very fresh and doesn't taste fried or greasy."}
{"text":"Tried it, way overrated, way over priced for food in a basket.  Milk shake had little flavor would not go back."}
{"text":"These burgers are no good and over priced. Tried the double decker, melt, bbq bacon. Fries   terrible too."}
{"text":"Very good Burgers the four of us agree but the onion were too greasy couldn't eat them all, and the prices were too high"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here on Saturday afternoon with my wife.  Place was a bit hectic, crowded and wait was 45min long.  But we needed up at the bar and had no real wait.  They called us after 15 min for a table so really deceptive about the 45 minutes. Here is the gist of the visit:
Had a very expensive Bloody Mary. Good not great. 
Wahlburgers special brew  was very good but for price average. 
We both had burgers. Some of the best burgers we have had.  Buns were fresh, burgers cooked perfectly, condiments on them were spot on. Fiesta burger was excellent, hearty and not too spicy. Loved it. The basic burger my wife had was also very good.  
Fries were hot and fresh and a
Nothing special. 
For the price we paid for all of that....well over $50....it's seemed expensive. Vegas burger places are just that.....expensive. I would give a 4 - 5 star based on burgers but overall it's a 3+. Would return again."}
{"text":"I had gone to the Wahlburgers at Fenway last summer and I thought it was good then. I have to say that the Cleveland one was even better! I have been dreaming about my burger for the past 24 hours! I got the Our Burger, my sis got the Thanksgiving burger and her bf got the OFD. All of us were impressed! The burger was perfectly tender and juicy. I loved the bun- soft and lightly toasted. It was excellent! I got the fries, my sis got the sweet potato tots and her bf got the onion rings. I actually loved the onion rings bc they are made with red onions and not white onions. Game changer! The service was good as well. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Burgers were definitely old. The cheese looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp for way too long. My colleague and I were returning from a business trip and this location happened to be right across from our gate. So we thought we would get a burger before the flight boarded. 

Unfortunately, I read the boarding time incorrectly. We asked to cancel the burger but they said that it was ready for us and we could get it to go. Now the beers we ordered had just arrived. How can the beers arrive at the same time as the burger? And the policy is that the burgers have to be well done. We also ordered the house onion rings, which were a mess! It was one large ball of soggy and every very greasy sliced onions. We ended up throwing those out entirely. 

Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write.  I feel so conflicted by Wahlburgers.  First off, I keep seeing reviews about the prices.  Given the location; the prices are quite reasonable.  You can go to almost any fast food place on that block and pay just as much, sometimes more.  So with that being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the prices.

Some of my findings:
Fiesta burger - absolutely amazing
Tater tots - good
Wahl sauce - outstanding 
Sweet potato tots - soggy


While I found most of the food to be really good, the service was a bit shaky.  I ordered a milk shake with my meal, but it didn't come.  Another issue we had was that my mother, who's a vegetarian; ordered a salad sans meat.  We explained that she's a vegetarian and need her salad minus the meat, but it came with meat.  They then had to remake it and we sat for about 20 minutes before the food arrived. I was in the rest room (out the door and around the corner) when the food came, so I missed the waiter.  When he came back again our meal was almost finished and I had to remind him about the milkshake.  He was very sincere and apologetic, but I still waited probably 40 minutes for a milkshake.   That being said; these things can be chalked up to human error. Accidents happen, and while it was two; I wasn't too mad about it.

One thing I did find to be a bit out of line was the photographers.  At one point while we were waiting for our food someone came up and offered us to take a picture for a complimentary postcard.  We agreed, who would say no?  Later on, while I had my face stuffed with food, a woman came by and hovered over me with a book of pictures asking for money.  I felt that that was just intrusive and a bit tacky.  I eventually just had to shake my head no, because she didn't give me a chance to swallow my burger before she walked away seeming agitated.  I would definitely recommend that this practice be re-evaluated by management, as it just kind of came off rude.  

All in all, I liked Wahlburger's.  The food was good enough and I work nearby.  I would consider going back, and with a smoother experience I could see myself giving this place a 4 or 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The food here is great. The waiter we had was amazing, but we sat outside and it felt like 100 degrees no patio. The only reason I didn't like it was the tables outside, I could scratch my nail on it and black grit would come up and that disgusted me. They don't wash the tables very well. The fact of it being vegas and people smoking everywhere. I feel like you should wash the tables every time another customer comes."}
{"text":"The burgers were really good, cooked just like I like them with a little pink in the center. I'd recommend this place"}
{"text":"This was my first time and I was not disappointed Victor was our water and the service was great. I will be back and tell ally family and friends."}
{"text":"Interesting hamburger place.  Typical tourist trap in Las Vegas.  Burgers were ok.  Kids hated hotdog.  Sloppy Joe was honestly crap.  With soggy meat, liquid cheese and the special sauce it tasted as bad as it looked.  Happy birthday to me. I'll stick with In and Out"}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing special, very plain menu items. $40 for two blah burgers and cold tater tots. The open faced sloppy joe looked like something barely edible from 7Eleven."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Wahlburger. Maybe it was the TV show influencing me, maybe because I'd met Mark Walhberg before, I really wanted to like Wahlburger.

I think the airport environment didn't help - when you take a chain restaurant and implant it into an airport setting, invariably the product suffers in some way. In this case, it was a lack of care in the construction of my burger and service that was pretty much a non-starter.

I arrived at 1pm, was offered a table or the bar; I chose the bar. Sat myself down, several employees walked by, but nobody offered to serve me. Eventually, I said loudly \"i'd like to order food, can I have a menu please?\"

An employee looked at me and asked aloud \"who's got that side of the bar?\"
....no answer. It's now 1.10pm. She somewhat reluctantly hands me a menu, I ask for an iced water. 

I chose the \"Our Burger\", which is a house special at $9.95 CAD. It comes with (or without) 'Government cheese'. I had to look that up....! 

I ordered a side of Yukon Gold fries. Around 12 minutes later, an employee slides a basket in front of me \"there's your burger\". Walks away, says nothing else.
Hmmmm.

It looked OK, somewhat dishevelled in construction, but I thought I'd give it a go. The meat patty was thick and still somewhat juicy, although the menu does state that all patties are cooked well-done. 

The salad was ok, the lettuce wasn't nice at all and it needed some more sauce; it was somewhat dry. The fries weren't hot and were quite limp, like they'd been cooked a while ago and sitting around under a heat lamp. 

I ate most of the burger and some of the fries. I hoped for so much more; but I've had better. I'll try a non-airport location too, as a comparison exercise. 

Wahlburger, I wanted to like you. I really did...."}
{"text":"Oh em gee! The Mac n cheese was so amazing! So creamy and flavorful with little bits of smoky bacon. I also had Jenn's chicken sandwich which was very tasty. Portions and prices are just right. 
The bestie wasn't thrilled about the thanksgiving burger."}
{"text":"The service tonight was amazing as was the food.  The staff (Luce especially) was so nice.  Unfortunately we don't get to Vegas often,  but we'll definitely be back when we're in town."}
{"text":"We showed up at 1am on a Sunday and surprised they were even open! Sat at the bar, the two servers we had were great! Really nice. My husband and I ordered 2 burgers and 2 shakes. Food was good tasted fresh. Be prepared to spend at least 50 bucks which seems like a lot but it's Vegas. Would have given 5 stars but the price point was a bit much for burgers and shakes"}
{"text":"Supper bummed! We paid 80.00 for 4 sodas 3 burgers and 3 fries. The but was good but nothing to run back for and the fries were awful.  it made me really sad because I am a huge fan of the family! They all seem to be great people so I was surprisingly very disappointed."}
{"text":"Would give this 3.5 stars if i could. The service was pretty good, friendly staff. The bathroom was dirty, I expected a little more to start with that. Overall, the burgers were good, but not awesome. The fries were thick, and pretty plain. The sweet potato tots were average. Altogether, everything was good but probably not something I would come back specifically to seek out and eat. Nothing on the menu jumped out and said HEY this looks great! I had the BBQ bacon burger. It was on the smaller side, but the avocado spread was a nice addition. My husband got the fiesta burger. The meat was good and quality just not packed well and falling apart in his hand. The prices seem to lineup with any other burger place, since the sides are separate, it still evens out to be the same price as burgatory. I had low expectations going in, and it didn't really exceed them.. if you want to say you went here just because then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Food was good. Little pricy for my taste but I have to remember I'm on the strip. Prices are always higher on the strip. Very clean atmosphere. Service was great! The burgers and macncheese were good. 
The layout a bit confusing. You come in wait in line for a pager. Then you need to leave the building by walking all the way across the restaurant. There is no standing room. Then when your paged you come back into that waiting line and have to bypass everyone. You get dirty looks like your cutting line. Thought maybe they could give you pagers outside.  Would make things run more smoothly inside.
Maybe that's against strip rules. Just seems like to much going on inside. Very busy. All tables were full. All in all glad I tried it but probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Whalburgers, and it was awesome!!!  Chloe, our server, was spectacular.  I highly recommend the sweet potato tots.  Our burgers were loaded with flavor and perfectly cooked.  Greatest place to go for a burger."}
{"text":"Way better than I expected. Not just another \"celebrity\" own restaurant, much better than Guy's places. Pretty decent price, for las vegas strip. 

A lots of cute little shops in the area, right in front Bally Casino.

All in all, love this place, wish they would hurry up and open one in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Wow, is the word for this place. I never had a hamburger so juicy and fresh. Hands up the best place to eat in Vegas besides a buffet. Open until late and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This was the worst burger. It was greasy and tasteless. The onion rings were straws and greasy. The only good thing was the tator tots. My husband refused to eat and I ate half of the burger and it instantly made me sick to my stomach. Never will go back and do not recommend. Go to BRGR, Burgatory or Red Robin. Eat n Park super burger is way better."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time today, had a great experience! They told us it'd be a half hour wait and they were able to seat us around 20 minutes which wasn't bad at all for how busy they were! Our server was Brie and she was wonderful. Our food came out fast and hot! And there was a ton of food for the decent prices. And most importantly the meals were delicious! Would definitely go again! I think for how new this location is/how busy they are, they really have it together."}
{"text":"I don't eat fast food, I didn't know anything about wahlburgers, and I don't eat burgers very much. With that said, I thought my burger was quite good. Perfectly done, great sauce, everything came together for one great burger. The fries were crispy and tasted exactly the way I like them. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had to write a review simply because of the poor ones I've seen. I'll be honest I never really watched the show (I'm a BSB gal ) but my friends and I were excited to try the food because we've heard great things. It was about a 45 min wait (to be expected on a Sunday for lunch) and we were instantly greeted by a woman when we sat down. She was so unbelievably nice that we just found ourselves chit chatting with her! Turns out she was the manager (can't think of her name...) who was taking our order. We just loved talking to her she was so nice and funny...a definite great hire!! The food was simply amazing we had the original burger and tots..best burger I think I've ever had. Thank you for the amazing service and delicious food! - 4 chicagoians who came for the BSB but stayed for the wahlburgers :)"}
{"text":"For real though, this place is great!! I tried the Mark's Fav (Thanksgiving Turkey Burger) and Donnie's Fav (BBQ Bacon Burger)... both SOO good! The meat is well flavored and the buns are nice and soft. I  also got a Strawberry Mule and it was on point. The prices were very reasonable - especially for Vegas! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Greetings! This review is more or less geared to Chicagoans as we're about to get our first Wahlburgers-- albeit in St. Charles, Illinois (Source: Kane County Chronicle, May 9, 2018), where no doubt people won't mind paying $10 for a basic Wahlburger and a soft drink. It was only that I happened to be in Las Vegas this week that I discovered the famous family's burger joint. 

Located at the Grand Bazaar Shops on the Bally's property, you can't miss the old school diner-inspired git-up. Especially if you're staying at Bally's or any one of the nearby hotel/casinos such as Flamingo or Paris, I think it's a must-try. 

The burger is very good, no doubt about it. Service here was also quite friendly and helpful considering the place was packed and super-busy. So much so that I opted to grab a seat at the counter; something I don't normally do. Have to say I was anxious to try my first Wahlburger. Obviously because I jumped in with both feet ordering the Double Decker. Good choice if you're really hungry and your tastebud receptors are craving quality meat, cheese and toppings.

The Double Decker consists of two 3oz burgers, lettuce, tomato, onion, \"government cheese\" (haha-- American), signature sauce and pickles. Price: $12.95

Yes, regarding \"government cheese\" I can confirm via Wahlburgers Twitter account they describe it as like \"American cheese, only better.\" I just find it kind of funny, or maybe just a fun thing to talk about with your server after your initial perusal of the menu. 

Anyhow, my first burger experience at Wahlburgers was I'd say approaching top-notch on food quality and pushing perfection on the whole. The only minor issue was perhaps the slightly longer than average wait for the food to arrive, but I'm certainly not complaining. 

I give Wahlburgers 4.9 out of 5 on my own burger scale! I can hardly wait till they build their first location in Chicagoland. Meantime, looking forward to my next Vegas trip and another visit to Wahlburgers near Bally's."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Waited 30mins for a table(which I understand) but then took 15mins for someone to come to the table to greet us. He took our order (drink and food) then we had to ask for our drinks 20mins later. Then 30mins later we finally got our food and he brought one of our guests her \"burger\" without a meat pattie? That's not a burger. Thank god it tasted good at the end."}
{"text":"So my friends and I decided to try out this place on the recommendation of a close friend of ours. we were in costume and appreciate that they allowed us in with them on. however. that was the extent of their good service. first of all. when my friend who clearly stated that he was diabetic and ordered his coffee and a diet coke. and you give him splenda for his coffee but regular coke? the hell? this is not \"oh I'm drinking diet coke because I need to lose weight and i like the taste\" no, this is, \"I drink diet coke because if i have regular coke, I could possibly go into diabetic shock\" next was the coffee we got, it was weak and tasteless. and not worth the 2.63 I spent on it. also they never asked if we wanted more coffee, my boyfriend was asked multiple times if he wanted another soft drink. so did my friend's fiancee, they both got refills on their drinks, so why can't we get another cup of coffee. next was the food, where to start, overpriced, not that good, and for the amount you get, I could go to a street meat guy and get twice the amount for less than what I spent on it. my boyfriend and my friends ordered a side of sweet potato bites and onion rings, which granted the onions were great, but they were not rings, more... strings of fried to a crisp. the sweet potato bites soso. to be honest they tasted like the same ones I could get at Loblawas for 10 dollars and get a nice big bag of them. when we got our food, the server, who's name was Allan. just gave the food to my other friends sitting on the other side of the table. so we assumed that their hamburgers had come with said sides, when we asked when we would be getting our food, Allan bluntly stated that \"oh you got already, i see you have the empty cups\" I am utterly shocked at the lack of service, training and lack of attention to detail they had there. in all honesty I could of gone to an A&W gotten better costumer service, better food, more food, faster service at less than half the price. it was also incredibly loud in there, and hard to have a conversation. when your business is focused on having people stay for more than just a cup of under-brewed coffee, you don't have the music level at new kids on the block concert levels. also the video monitors, I'm not quite sure what channel they had it on, but we saw a fat dude in a latex Edward scissor hands costume playing drums, and chest bumping with robocop who could use a call from Jenny, tho robocop looks like he called jenny and then ate jenny. note that there were also small children in the restaurant as well, as in less than 10 years old kids. crap food, horrid service, louder than when my neighbors are hosting band practice. and more offensive than an old fat guy with a bubba beard dressed as sailor moon at an anime convention. all in all, it's just the new kids on the block fans that are keeping this business afloat, as well, if you are working behind the bar, don't have a playoffs beard out there, as someone who has had multiple jobs in food service, i know that you have a beard, you wear a beard net, or you go home and shave it off, i don't care if it's \"Movember\" or it's totally ironic to have it, when you are serving alcohol, and you have a beard that'd make a lumberjack jealous, it's called there's a shoppers drug mart down the street, shick, Gelette, take your pick, it's on sale too! so there, in all honesty, I am never going to go there again. Nor will my friends or my boyfriend. I have never been so appalled by a supposed tripple A restaurant. also when you have a person just stating at the door looking pretty, you could at least have them guide us to our seats instead of just standing there. As wel, I could hear the music from down the road quite clearly. when i was going to the roundhouse and i can still hear your music. too loud dude too god damn loud. I will be posting pictures as well to show how much of a ptitful ammount of food you get, when you ask for it to \"share\""}
{"text":"Looked on yelp at hesitated to come in this joint because of the 3 star rating, but honestly most yelpers put the negative before the good on here. Sense of Entitlement is nasty. Came here may 29th after a long day on the pool, the food was amazing, service was great and attentive, my burger The Melt with blue cheese came out the way I like it , well done. All my friends said the same thing , phenomenal and it deserves 5 stars . Thank you"}
{"text":"After much hype, Wahlburgers has come to town.

Yes, it's in the Soho Hotel, around the corner from Luckee. Yes, it's the new hot thing. But sadly, no, it's not that great.

So just to be clear, there's nothing particularly wrong with it (unless you count the rotund fellow wearing a FORD NATION shirt, while chowing down with his family. But seriously, there's nothing \"wrong with it.\" The burgers seem fresh, the buns are fine and everything is just, well, fine. But that's the thing - they are not particularly flavourful or there is nothing about the meat or the sandwich that screams \"THIS IS A WAHLBURGER!\" If I was to blind taste test a series of burgers I would not know I had one.

We tried the BBQ burger, which came highly recommended, with the sweet potato tots and macaroni salad on the side. I think the macaroni salad was my favourite thing we ate. It tasted like it had been made from scratch, not too much mayo. Just fresh. Good.

Pricewise, the burgers seem pretty reasonable at about $9.75 each but none come with a side, not even fries. So if you want a burger and, oh I don't know, maybe some fries, expect to pay the usual overpriced Toronto standard of $15 and up.

Another thing that was sort of presumptuous was that 18% gratuity is added to any and all bills. The service wasn't bad, other than a mix up that had the food runner \"selling\" our plate because he didn't know what table to bring it to, but it would have been nice to know before ordering that 18% was being tacked on just for transparency's sake.

There are TVs all around the restaurant and at the bar that show basically one of two things: sports games and clips from the Wahlburgers reality show on a loop. It didn't appear that anyone who was in the restaurant gave a dingo's kidneys about either. I mean, it's in the tony Soho hotel so that doesn't exactly scream Boston sports bar. This is Toronto baby; we're too cool for everything.

I guess final verdict is that in a city that is so inundated with burger joints, one would thing that Wahlburgers would bring something more to the table other than the fact that it bears the name of the Wahlbergs."}
{"text":"So, I tried Wahlburgers at 2am.. and it was a takeout.

Other than it being soggy - my fault for not eating it there, but the burger was enjoyable. 

The Mac & Cheese was pretty bomb, and would have tasted even better if I had eaten it first.

To be honest, I need a second go and really sit down at the joint and eat it there. 


**I heard the patty melt was the item I was suppose to get vs. the burger.

So I guess I will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! The service is something that is left to be desired. I came here in a party of six. They messed up two of the orders. My friend had asked for no jalapeños on her burger and when she told the waitress that there were jalapeños on it, she insisted there wasn't. There was a bunch of the waiters/waitresses standing around. We waited 15 minutes after eating until we got our checks. Like I said the food is delicious! This being a new restaurant in town, they just need to get the service kinks figured out."}
{"text":"What is this crazy burger heaven that has 'government cheese' on their menu descriptions and baskets of golden onion strings?  Wahlburger!  We happen to be in Cleveland at the same time as my dad. We met up at this Wahlburgers just outside of The Jack casino. He raved about the sloppy joe and had to try it. Parking is at the casino garage and set us back $6 just to have lunch. 

My father is not a big eater, but when he finds something good, he sticks to it. He found that here. Dad started his meal with a root beer float. Made with IBC - that something they are doing right! My husband was sold on the sloppy joe and I opted for the mac n cheese with fried fish on top. 

The food was great!  If you like government cheese mac n cheese. I didn't know what it was and opted to try it. I didn't care for it. The fish was fine though. The sloppy joes were amazing. Talk about comfort food, done well, and affordable. Huge portion, so opt to share if feeding kids, for sure. The onion rings/straws are perfect. I would eat them on everything.  

Anthony was our server - he got a few things mixed up but quickly fixed it all each time. Big windows, lots of seating, TVs everywhere and great location, just downtown Cleveland. I see why Dad likes this place. 

Can't wait to try the one at Greektown in Detroit, now."}
{"text":"Came here on December 19, 2016. We have been to the Orlando, FL one as well. It was just as good as the Orlando one. The bartenders were awesome and very tentative. They have just started a happy hour special. A burger for $5.00. Wow what a deal!! It also comes with a side. Sold!! The sweet potato tater tots are excellent!! Everything was amazing and we will be back every time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were on Vegas from Nashville to see Reba and she loves Mark and Paul so when she saw the sign, flipped out.  The service was friendly and timely.  She has the sloppy joe and I had Mark's burger but on a salad.  Both were excellent.  Mark's burger i s really tasty and healthy. I highly recommend it.  We were very happy with our experience."}
{"text":"This morning I have a breakfast sandwiched the sauce is spicy and got me sick please avoid that for happening to other people"}
{"text":"Had to try it as Ive heard nothing but great things about the burgers as well as the celebrity profile of the place.....(we watch the show)
Started off with the strawberry vodka lemonade very delicious.
We ordered 2 of the Our burgers which is Pauls favorite burger it had the signature wahl sauce on it (tasted like thousand islands mixed with a few other things) very good flavor  . We also tried the basics tater tots and thin string onion rings . 
Overall pretty good flavors on everything not to to pricey especially for Vegas definantly a place to try if your in town ....."}
{"text":"Had Lunch in Sunday at 1:45.  It took 30-45 minutes to get our 2 burgers.  The burgers were mediocre and not worth the high price.  We ordered the triple and yes, I saw 3 patties, but they were small thin slices.  Not what I expected at the $14+ per burger. 
I guess it's the name your paying for.  Taste was - bland- nothing to tell a friend to try.

Better of visiting: Whataburger, Burger King, and even McDonalds.  

Save the $60 lunch for two else where.  I will not be back!!  Don't believe the marketing.  My triple burger was smaller than any of the pics in the menu"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, glad we did because the burgers and onion frizzles were so good. Now I have to make trips to Boston just to get it when I'm craving it, very pleasantly surprised with our food."}
{"text":"Burger wasn't anything to write home about, it was dry and poorly put together. The nachos barely had any cheese on them and were cold when we received them. The service was good, our waitress was very polite and attentive, but the overall experience wasn't great and I don't believe I'll be going there again."}
{"text":"My wife and I had to try it and our first will  be our last Wahlburger. Disgusting!  We both ended up with food poisoning....  
Never again!"}
{"text":"Watched the show hoping for something great. Ended up being over priced, bland and a complete disappointment. Go to Fatburger."}
{"text":"Our burger was pretty delicious....yummy.... however I'm not a fan of chilli, I bought some for my friend and I just about ate the whole damn bowl!!! so good a must try."}
{"text":"Had the double decker and a Wahlbrewski. This burger hit the spot! Plenty of people eager to hate on a celebrity owned tourist spot, based on seeing other reviews. The service was great and eager to assist and clear any trash from the table. Very reasonable priced"}
{"text":"Omg... our first time in Vegas, of course we had to try Wahlburgers... I tried Marks fave. It was delicious! everyone senses food was fantastic too. Especially the sloppy Joe. All in all, great experience.  Our server Victor was great as well!"}
{"text":"My flight to Los Angeles was at gate F67. I then saw a sign saying that Wahlburgers was at the same gate. Perfect! It was lunchtime and I was ready to eat something new. 

The restaurant had a fast food area with snacks. You can also order hot food to go. I was asked by the greeter whether I wanted takeout or dine-in. I'll went with the latter, as I had an hour to kill before boarding my plane. I was then asked whether I wanted a seat at the bar or at a table. Again, I chose the latter. 

I ordered the OFD (Originally From Dorchestah) burger. It had a ground beef patty with bacon, sauteed mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and honemade tomato jam, all on a soft bun. The server asked me whether I wanted a side. I asked her how large the burger was. She said it was fairly large, so I opted out of getting a side. 

The verdict? OMG, this burger is through-the-roof delicious! Everything tasted fresh and flavourful. It is essentially a kicked-up version of a Swiss and mushroom burger with bacon. 

An extra shoutout goes to my server, Alexis. She was friendly, articulate, and helpful. She asked whether I wanted any snacks, as you can bundle that purchase with your restaurant meal. I was interested in getting a Clif bar to munch on my flight. She went to get all available flavours and laid them all on my table for me to choose what I wanted. If that isn't super customer service, I don't know what is. 

I thanked her just before I left. She told me that am a great customer and she enjoys serving \"those ones\" like me.

Should I ever be around this gate in Terminal 1, I'd eat here again. Perhaps I'll bring a bigger appetite, so I can get a side order of salad or tater tots. 

(104)"}
{"text":"Omg, seriously the best burgers in town! Something for everyone....vegetarians prepare to be amazed with the Impossible burger! The staff was super friendly and attentive as well!"}
{"text":"Was visiting friends in LV, and they mentioned this place just opened. I was pleasantly surprised how awesome it was!!! I love the concept! Our server Amanda was awesome, and the manager came by to check on us several times....I'll def make a trip back next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Wahlburgers exceeded my expectations. I went in thinking it would be just an average burger joint, with all of the hype generated by the owners being who they are. However, I was wrong. From the moment that I walked in the restaurant, to the moment that I walked out, I was impressed. 

The decor was simple but branded very well to reflect the Wahlberg family. The service was very fast and all of the staff was super friendly. The menu is very easy to read and it's not overwhelming, like some restaurants can be. I liked how a lot of the sauces/dressings are all made in house. We did not even have to wait long for our meals to be served after our orders were placed. 

I ordered a BBQ Bacon burger with fried pickles. I ordered a side of the signature Wahl sauce and ranch to go with my meal. The quality of the sauces and the taste complimented the pickles perfectly. My burger was cooked to perfection (medium) and was very flavorful. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and provided us with exceptional service. 

We ordered the grilled banana fluffanutta for dessert. This was one of my favorite parts of the meal! I would highly recommend trying it, if you save some room after your meal.

Wahlburgers truly exceeded my expectations by far and I will be returning in the future to taste different items on the menu!"}
{"text":"- I liked the friendly and attentive staff, the more or less full bar and the delicious burgers. I tend to like the tatter tots more than the fries. I loved the reality tv show before Wahlburgers ever came to Cleveland and happy they now that they are here. I will have to try the milkshakes next time I stop by."}
{"text":"Loved the burger here, better than In N Out. The only thing that would have made it better would have been Mark Wahlberg serving it to me in his Calvin Klein boxers."}
{"text":"Had to try this place because of Mark Wahlberg and the TV show but the food was nothing special. Average burger and fries. Cleveland definitely has better burgers. Townhall or Flipside or Harry Buffalo come to mind"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding- lovely waiter. 
Burgers were amazing. Best burger all of us have had in a long time. Canadas famous poutine- was good at least try it when in Canada;)"}
{"text":"Geez, don't believe the hype.  Boring food, below average quality burgers covered with tons of average quality condiments and such.  Very disappointed.  Two stars only because the the waiter was solid and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"Meh

Had better, had worse. 

Service was the problem. 
Waiter tried to remember the 3 orders but couldn't. 
So he wrote it down which is fine. 
But he disappeared forever and messed the separate checks up something awful. 

Probably won't go back. There's better places in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger, not very quick service. A club soda cost $3.25 and an order of fries was $3.50... That doesn't make much sense to me. Didn't see Mark or Donnie."}
{"text":"I will keep this simple.

High prices for very little value.
If it weren't for Marky Mark, Donnie, and airport locations this chain would not survive."}
{"text":"Nothing special about these burgers. I had the OUR burger and my partner had the OFD burger, we both thought they were very bland. Airport or not, we were expecting much more from this restaurant and were very dissappointed."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all, for a burger place you would think the burger would stand out from all the other burger joints. My wife and I tried it because we liked watching the tv show. Fries were just ok not great either. Burghers in Lawrenceville was ten times better. Won't be back, sorry Marky Mark, still love you."}
{"text":"Stopped by late night to grab a shake and sat at the tables while I waited. Store employees and manager told me you can only sit at the tables if you are dining in and made me get up. It was late, restaurant was closing soon, no line to get a table, restaurant was almost empty but they still couldn't let me sit for 5 minutes while I waited for my order. Definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"It's a cool environment and great service. It's pretty cool to just be able to say you've been there and seen it but the food is just ok. I'd honestly prefer an in n out burger over one of theirs. But would still go at least once if you've never been just to experience it. There sweet potato tots are amazing too!"}
{"text":"The last time I was here it was 3am on a Saturday night. This time I came here again because I had this huge debate whether or not we ate here before. I had my old review to prove we indeed did eat here. But round two here we go.

We came here during the day and there is a massive wait to dine here so one of us left our number with the hostess so they would text us that a table is open and ready for us while we stroll around nearby. I recommend grabbing some drinks at the Sin City Brewery which is around the corner about 500 feet away.

This time I got the SuperMelt which is pretty much the grilled cheese and a burger combined into one. This would be something I would recommend anyone stopping here to try.

If you're looking for some spiked milkshake, they have a menu for that as well I think you may need to request if they don't give it to you with the regular food menu. I got the Mud Pie which they put vodka, Kahlua, and chocolate liqueur and coffee cream in with vanilla frosting and Oreo cookie pieces. Very satisfying while getting some alcohol into your system.

Overall, this was a better experience and I'm glad I gave it another shot."}
{"text":"Ok, first it a burger joint. All you foodies, lighten up. Thank up Wahlberg's for returning the affordable yet delicious burger back to the dt area. For too long Torontonians have been taking it in the pocket book for some good quick eats. Then when a place comes along that does it better and cheaper, they bitch. 

So... my experience at Wahlburger's was exceptional. Maybe I wasn't comig in from all the hype, maybe I wasn't expecting a celebrity sighting, but rather just a decent burger. Actually that's what I got. 

My burger was the Thanksgiving Dinner, truly tasty would be an understatement. It is pretty much what it sounds like turkey, stuffing, cranberry, gravy all wrapped up tidily onto a bun. I followed up with a Mudpie \"adult\" frap shake. Made with an oreo cookie base and a wee bit of adult content. That's over 19 here in Canada, for the Americans reading this. 

My servers name was Kim, I highly suggest sitting in her section. She was on top of her game, and like every  great American  restaurant I have ever been to, she had refills of my water before my glass was ever empty. 

In summary, blah blah blah... great burgers, blah blah... great service, blah deblah good prices. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My mother watches the show all the time so she was so excited to try the food.  The servers were as nice as they could be. The food however is why I'm giving it a one star.  

My sister had to send her lemonade back because of how much sugar was in it.  She said her teeth automatically started hurting lol. 

We ordered: Mac & Cheese,  Chicken Fingers, Crispy Haddcock Sandwich, O.F.D burger, and The Our burger. 

The mac and cheese had no cheese in it.  Pretty much all water.. no favor at all... I really really mean this,  but the worst mac and cheese I ever tasted.  Kraft boxed mac and cheese is 70x better.  

I got stabbed in my mouth with two bones from the fish sandwich.  The burgers had nothing special about them. If you blindfolded yourself,  You couldn't tell the difference if you were eating a McDonald's burger or a Wahlburger... 

Such awful food. My ma was so disappointed. I felt so bad. :-("}
{"text":"First, they have no bathrooms!  In possibly the most germ ridden city in the U. S. , you have to cross a courtyard to use a public, barely working bathroom to wash your hands - before you eat from their menu of finger food. 
Secondly, although their burgers are good (not awesome) they are tiny compared to In n Out or Fatburger and nearly three times the price. Sorry, but the atmosphere of a dive burger place by Bally's is not worth the extra $. Green celebrity themed be damned. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Another Vegas place to try since the original Wahlburgers is in the east coast! *just kidding. I just realized there is a Los Angeles and West Hollywood location while writing this review. I had my mind set to eat at this place and I wanted to try something other than In N Out, Five Guys, and Shake Shack. I ordered the Our Burger and I believe it was Paul's favorite according to the menu. Just like all those other \"gourmet\" burger joints, this is a $11+ burger that only comes with the burger. All the sides are extra. I sat at the bar since it wasn't too busy and it actually didn't take long for my burger to come in. The only problem was it took a while for a waiter to come around so I can ask for more sauce since the burger was a little bit dry. After getting the sauce, man did that burger taste pretty good. Surprisingly, I finished it within minutes but I really wished it came with some fries or something. This is definitely a place to at least try but I might just stick with my Cheeseburger with grilled onions and some fries with some spread and that comes with a drink. Yep, you know what I'm talking about. It's what a hamburger's all about."}
{"text":"A mixed bag of reviews. We waited an hour for a table for four. The service, while friendly, seemed to be overwhelmed and understaffed. We had to go to the bar to ask for plastic knives and forks. Server forgot part of our order and it took forever for drinks to be served. Mixed drinks seemed to be barely touched by the alcohol bottle. The onion rings tasted funky, like fish had been fried in the oil just before the onion rings. The burger was good but nothing special for a place with \"burger\" in its name. The Sloppy Joe was tasteless. However, the patio was a nice surprise given the air conditioning wasnt working and the restauraunt was too hot to eat inside. Maybe it will get better as it matures but for now I am not eager to return."}
{"text":"I love New Kids on the Block since I was a kid so I had to check this out!

Get the Macaroni and cheese. It will change your life. No really. Don't forget to top with the bacon!

I came in last week with a friend while in Vegas for a work trip. We shared the sloppy Joe's, macaroni and cheese, sweet potato tots, and a burger. The sloppy Joe was tasty. I liked the crispy onions on top but like my sauce a bit more zesty. The sweet potato tots were the disappointment of the meal. They weren't crispy. With a nice crisp and yummy sauce they could be a winner. Burger was good but I was super full by then and kept going back for more sloppy joe bites so didn't try as much of that."}
{"text":"I have been twice now and I will continue to go back. There food is AMAZING I had the Jenn chicken Burger and fries and I have had the Our Burger and sweet potato tots !!! Very nice inside and friendly workers ! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Save the trip.  Food was no where close to as good as the show.  If you don't go, at least you can still watch the show without that bad taste in your mouth.  We really expected more.  Attached is a picture of the sloppy Joe exactly as it was served.  Nasty.  They were gracious enough to replace with a burger that was average.  Tater tots were luke warm and greasy.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm very sad and disappointed in my Wahlburgers experience.  I'm a big fan of the show so I maybe had unrealistic expectations.  We were there as part of a night out prior to a wedding with the rest of our friends.  The service was terrible, most of our orders were wrong in that we were served incorrect items or things weren't customized as ordered (you know, no tomato, cooked medium) etc.  I ordered the onion rings because they are supposed to be really great.  They were terrible.  They were cold and had no flavor.  I mentioned to the server that the onion rings were cold and she brought new ones.  They were hot but still had no flavor.  The fries were pretty good. 

The person running food out, instead of looking at the ticket would just yell and ask whose food it was.  The problem is that English was a 2nd language for him and nobody could understand.  It was also very loud because it's Vegas.  For the cost I would have expected him to be able to properly run food and look at seat numbers.  Maybe if I went to a different Wahlburgers in a different state it would be better.   Maybe because it's Vegas they take for granted that they can just act the way they did because they'll never see you again.

As such a huge fan (like weekly since the show started) I was very very sad. And disappointed for our friends who were there to celebrate."}
{"text":"Food quality is good but for the amount of food you get, it's not worth the price. And it is quite expensive (gourmet burger pricing). Our order of two burgers, two sides and one shake came out to over $40 for take-out.

The stand-out is really the sweet potato tots. These are truly addictive! I recently found out they increased the price from $3.50 to $4.50 without increasing the portions. They couldn't even top it off! It's such a jip and it kills me because these tots are SO good. I also liked the deep fried onions as they are stringy and not your typical thick-cut onion rings. Also had the Thanksgiving burger and double stack burger. Both were good but the size of the patties were just very sad.

A lot of reviewers mentioned confusion over the layout. Here's how it works: There is dine-in with bar service on ground level (wait to be seated). Cashiers are located all the way in the back for take-out orders. BUT there is seating upstairs for take-out orders (no table service). 

Worth trying once and see for yourself. I won't come back unless I'm desperately craving the sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Brittany helped me order, as I had never been previously, breaking down the menu and helping me select the best possible choice. I'm a bit picky when it comes to food. She recommended I have the classic with fries. It was fabulous. With Brittany's service and amazing food, which is also affordable, I'll be making a visit again in the best future. I recommend anyone in Vegas to try this place out."}
{"text":"My wife and I watch the show. We decided to try out the Vegas Restaurant. 1st off the family values they talk about and quality ARE NOT at this Franchise. From begaining to end it was a horrible experience. My option take your name off the building its an embarresent to your name.

Not too busy for a late 2pm lunch. 30 minutes till a waiter showed up. All the works will completely ignore you as though you don't exist and the moment you order you no longer exist until it's time to pay up. We ordered our food my wife ordered a drink that never showed up during the 45 minute wait for food or the following 30 minutes to get the bill BUT IT SURE DID GET CHARGED THEY DID NOT MISS THAT! Massive fight to get it removed. We were called lists until the bartender looked it up and Nopeshe never got the order. Burgers are great. Only had water since our waiter never got my Dr Pepper or my wife's drink. The extremely disappointing thing that you can watch from the kitchen is all the sides ypu pay $5 eachfor. I would say 20 of each to include the Chile sitting under a heat lamp going stale and cold. That's what you get. Nothing freshly cooked. We tried to complain of the rock hard cold fries and onion slices but the workers MUST be trained  to fully ignore the customer. The family behind us asked at least 10 different workers for water refills for their children. We watched as the workers looked at them and completely ignored them. The father of the group went up and had to get water for his kids himself. At which point the staff suddenly noticed him doing their job. The staff are just plain nasty people to all of us customers. 

My suggestion Take cash only. Your not going to feel the need to tip anyone. The service is truly that bad. I would not trust them not to tip themselves. That's the feeling you get from this place. Shady and ripped off. $40 plus for 2 good burgers, 2 old stale cold sides, 2 waters. No manager as far as we could see only one guy who did not at all who we think was the manager.

 A suggestion for the business. Don't do your money counting out in the open its sad watching a guy count out his tips cut it in half and keep his half as the guy we guessed was the manager and head waiter split the other half. 

Massive disappointment and extremely bad place to eat at. I have to good friends from Boston who go all the time to the original store. They love it. Told them about this place and they were shocked."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Great Wahlbruski. Came down for a midnight snack and it did not disappoint. If you want a great straightforward burger, this is the place to go.  DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"First time at Wahlburgers.  I got the Melt with onion rings and one of the local $5 cans of IPA.  I was very happy with it all.  Burger was great. Onion rings were more like onion straws vice thick cut but delicious.  Beer was great.   Price was typical of most Vegas burger joints.  Service was excellent and very fast.  My food came out in well under 10 minutes as did the other orders around me.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"I was Sooo disappointed!!! I had been wanting to eat here since I was a fan of the show especially their Mom.  So of course I ordered the Mac and Cheese inspired by her and who doesn't like a good gooey Mac and Cheese?  Well this was neither good or gooey!!! In fact it hardly had any cheese in it at all. Tasted like dry cooked
Noodles that weren't even salted!! I asked the girl at the counter if Paul or his brothers had been there yet and she told me they had not been there since it has been open. Maybe that's the problem or they should hire a quality control person!!! It was the worst!!! So sad!!! Now I can't even watch the tv show because I know now it is all just a gimmick!! ( btw Herbert Keller was at his restaurant) Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Better than I expected but not out of this world fabulous.  If it was a free standing location off the Strip I would definitely make it a point to re-visit on our next trip to Vegas but parking in the Paris/Balleys garage and trapsing through the casino is a pain for those of us that come here often and avoid the Strip.  But if you're on foot anyway, give it a go.  Burgers were very juicy (even my well done one...I don't do pink burgers).  The waitress explained the menu since it was our first visit and was very sweet.  Tots were great and fries were good too."}
{"text":"So I was super excited to try the Wahlbergs restaurant and I must say it was not a disappointment.! We went on a rainy day in Vegas but we still sat outside which was covered. I would say we waited about 20 min before we were seated which wasn't to bad because they were extremely busy.
After we were seated they took our drink orders right away. And when they came back with the drinks we placed our entrée orders. I ended up going with the double stacked burger and I added pulled pork to that. It only took about ten minutes before the food came out so that was great total time we were there was a little less than an hour.
When the food came out I was surprised how big the burger was. It was just dripping in sause and stacked with pulled pork! It was so delicious the burger was cooked perfectly and that pulled pork was amazing! I would advise to definitely add it to your burger it's so worth it! I would for sure re visit this place!
And their Wahlberg sauce is so amazing make sure you try that for your fries or tots!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time before the Cavs game last night. It was not exactly what I was expecting. We got seated right away, but it took our waitress a bit of time to get over to us. After ordering the food came out so fast. I was really surprised. They brought my sandwich without my mayo on the side. So I asked for mayo and they brought it, but then I realized they don't give you silverware. So I walked up to the hostess stand and asked for some and they looked at me very oddly. A different person then said you mean like a fork and knife? So I said yes and she handed me a plastic fork and knife. Then our waitress stopped by and asked if we wanted wahlsauce for our tots so we said yes even though they were halfway gone. My date got the our burger and liked it, but commented that it was no B Spot. I got the Jenn's chicken sandwich and thought it was just okay. There were tons of caramelized onion and fried onions on top, but it lacked flavor and was incredibly messy to eat. 

Just okay  in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not a great burger and not bad. Service was slow and needed a lot of improvement but the food was hot and all around ok."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a burger place in a long while that still uses real fresh beef like this place. Not only was it real beef but it was cooked to order perfection for me it was med rare and full of flavor. I had the onion rings and those were just as amazing. Very thin and fried without an ton of batter. Best part is that once we were ready to order(took us a while to decide) the food was being delivered to our table before we knew it. The staff and service were just as great as the food and very accommodating. My wife doesn't eat a lot of carbs or gluten and they graciously turned her haddock sandwich into a salad for her. I have to say I was impressed as the Haddock was very tasty as well! Thank you Wahlburgers for a good meal and a great time. We enjoyed the food, music and great service! Thank you Alexandria H. for making our experience a enjoyable and pleasant one with your outstanding service and kind friendly attitude. 

Wahlburgers you really should come to New Orleans I think if you could bring this kind of quick service and friendly atmosphere with servers like Alexandria you would have the best burger joint in town."}
{"text":"People. Give it a few months to complain about the service/attentiveness of this new franchise. -

This review will be about the food.

Been here twice. Spent $33 each day. Once on the soft opening on thursday and returned the next day friday.

On thursday order-
Ordered 'Our' burger: 1/3lb burger, lettuce, onion, \"goverment\" cheese (white cheese?), paul's signature wahl sauce (tasted like thousand island mixed with another foreign condiment?), housemade pickles. 

Thanksgiving day sandwich: fresh ground turkey burger (a 1/4 size of a 1/3lb meat patty. In otherwords- thin), stuffing, mayo, housemade orange-cranberry sauce, roasted butternut squash (um, no it wasn't. It was basically mashed butternut squash.)

Yukon french fries,

Malted mint chocolate frappe.

The buns are airy and very squishy. They give their buns a nice char on the grill though. But dull on flavor overall by itself. Frankly its just a bun. Nothing special. Cooked medium well, a smidgeon of pink visible in the first bite.

My thoughts? Its ok. If you have a knack to eat at franchise fast food joints... You may find this burger to be inferior to the likes of in and out or to that of shake shack.

I didn't detect much seasoning to the patty. That's ok, right? You wanted to taste the meat. Cheap. Run of the mill ground meat from the grocer.

Sadly I couldn't identify what the cheese tasted like due to the 'wahl' sauce. If it is a 'goverment' cheese... Well the joke is that it has no flavor and was not exactly an enjoyable food source.

I did finish the patty, some pickles and onions. Discarded the half chewed bun.

Onto the french fries. Modest portion. I found mine to be unsalted or miniscule grains existed on my batch. Since I got this to go, they didn't offer or decide to put in any condiments. O-k. By themselves- not that enjoyable. It being crunchy is the only save these get.

Onwards onto the turkey sandwich. This was actually the better of the order. But!!! Exaggerated exclamations! The most defiling topping in this burger was the 'roasted' (it was mashed) butternut squash. In my mind, If I had to deconstruct this sandwich to relativity: its bread roll, sliced turkey, cran sauce, mashed vegetable, stuffing. Except its a sandwich. But a sandwich on a bun? O-k.

Since the bun is squishy, it simply worked out for the thin patty and its toppings. But, ugh. That squash mash was not enjoyable. Imagine this bland mush with this hint of butternut somewhere in there. It kind of throws off the sandwich. Textures count. Stuffing is standard. No alarms there.

However, even these minute concerns- this was probably the better items you might enjoy there.

The shake leaves little to be desired. Asked to be malted and the server said they would do it, but it didnt taste malty and it certainly wasn't thick like a malt should be. I feel the ice cream product they use doesn't possess a high enough fat count as flavor of itself felt weak and thin. (Thin as in watered. So skim milk thin.)

Without knowing what brand of ice cream they use; definitively it would be hard to say whether it had artificial flavoring for its chocolate/mint. But, to me, it was just generic as it gets. So I'd assume it would be artificial flavorings.

It was soft opening. There are kinks, mishaps, errors that will need to be ironed out. In Las Vegas.. Franchises that come out here don't come packaged with the employees your familiar with either from the state your from or the pseudo celebrity food channel that makes these businesses appear flawless or the memory of an affair you had with said establishment.

Thats setting the expectations to a very low standard. If you work hospitality in this city... I am hoping you have a greater ability of discernable tastes. Or atleast be knowledgable to quality to quantity.

----

On friday's order:

Ordered Two Grilled banana fluffanutters: peanut butter, fresh banana, fluff (marshmellow) & nutella

Black & white malted shake
Coffee malted shake

Thin crispy onion rings.

So.. There was an issue with the fluffanutters. After signing my check and leaving the tip in the cup. About 25 minutes pass by.

Im thinking like.. Ok. None of my items really require this much time in preparation. At some point, the waittress tells me that they didn't make the fluffanutters cause they stopped serving the desserts by 1am.

Hmm. O-k. Didn't respond back with any sarcastic remark or anything. Just frowned and said ok. However! She said she would ask them make new fresh batch. \"Oh! Cool!\" I thought in my mind. \"You just made up for my time almost wasted!\" An additional disgruntled thought processed through.

4 minutes pass by. They just set the shakes down in a togo carrier. (But didnt label which shake was what. ) Along with the box of onion rings and ketchup! (Oddly, not for the french fries for yesterday.. Hah!)

5 minutes pass by. This order was to go. Strangely, they brought out two dine in trays to bar. - yelp says im at my txt review - whatever"}
{"text":"This place is super clean and the staff was awesome!  I ordered the bbq burger and fries.  My friend ordered the burger melt and an adult frappe. Everything was delicious!  I was pleasantly surprised with the in house photography.  I now have a great souvenir that I love! The only thing missing was a picture with Donnie!  I was hoping and praying that I would finally meet him.  But, I will definitely be back for another tasty burger!"}
{"text":"I was craving a solid burger tonight. Despite the reviews, I took a chance because it's right around the corner and always packed. I sat at the bar because I was flying solo and the bar tender is probably the best looking man I've seen in Toronto so far (I'm from California). I ordered a beer, the BBQ Burger and sweet potato tots. It was freaking delicious!!! I was missing home and craving In-N-Out but this hit the spot. Finally, something above average in more ways than one!"}
{"text":"I just can't believe the bad pricing that exists here.  I get it they have to pay for the high rent that Soho must charge but seriously.

The burger is decent, average at best.  The buns are thick and a bit too bready.

So I ordered a 5 oz burger with cheddar and a milkshake, which was actually pretty good.  And that's it.  No fries, no onion rings, no lobster, no filet mignon, nothing else and the price was $19.

See the picture and you decide if this is a well pricing scheme for this resto."}
{"text":"Maybe they need to train the hostess the waiters and the staff a little better and for the food I went to in and out afterwards because my food was horrible and I paid 15 bucks for a salad at salad how can you mess up on a chicken Caesar salad it hardly no lettuce tiny little salad OK then my boyfriend got the mac & cheese which was runny it was Brose no flavor to itmy son got a hotdog which tasted horrible like the hot though just had no late it just the tater tot's were good in the sweeper tater tot tater tot I will definitely not be back for a salad mac & cheese hot dogs and tater tot and one I paid a total of 4657+ a tip it just it's not worth it is way better places better burger joints. It seem like nobody had professionalism everybody kind it was just like goofing off playing around I don't know if this is the concept of their food or there you know if you're gonna wait 45 minutes to be seated you would expect your food to be brought out in also like real plate maybe man plastic cups I guess but no everything was brought out into the lake but to go container type a thing I don't know the whole concept of this restaurant I doyou had a waiter you had a host you have people taking the orders it was just weird I didn't like anything about it am sorry"}
{"text":"Layover in Canada headed home from Dubai. Why not try Wahlburgers. I ordered the classic salad with haddock and ranch for the dressing. My food came fairly quick. Only error was that they added the vingarette to my salad so that mixed with the ranch made it quite awkward tasting. The haddock was perfectly cooked and delicious. The crust was crispy and the fish was meaty and flaky. I enjoyed the fish and tarter more than the salad itself. 

I tried the poutine fries my sister ordered and they were delicious. I should've just ordered the fries and that's it. Them fries were amazing. The Gravy tasted like someone's grandmother made it from scratch. It was rich and flavorful. It was thick but not overly thick. The fries were fresh. The cheese curds were yummy too. 

I don't know when I'll ever be back in Canada to try it again or if they're located in the U.S but I definitely try them again."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for the burgers I ate at Wahlburgers. It was really busy, so I assume they sandbagged their burgers which means that they were pre cooking them, not made individually to order. Many restaurants cook that way when they are slammed in terms of orders. My burger was supposed to be medium rare but came out well done."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place... great fries... service was a little slow but food was great and sometimes on the strip staff can just be busy ... even though service was not the best I'll definitely come back to eat"}
{"text":"As soon as my friends and I sat down at the bar we we're amicably welcomed by Rodrigo who took care of us right away he had our drinks ready and when we're ready to order he understandingly took my complicated order with out any confusion. When my order came (which didn't take very long) my burger patty was cooked and served the way I wanted  it, it was juicy and the vegetables were fresh and my lettuce was crunchy. I'm definitely returning on my next Vegas adventure."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Wahlbergers before so we decided to try it tonight when our flight was delayed.

Interesting interior w fresh green decor. Speedy service.

My friend ordered the Dad Burger and he enjoyed it. Cost was  $10 and change   For his side he got the onion straws.  Not great, heavily battered overly salted and stone cold.

I had the Jenns salad which was ok.  Looked like leftovers tasted alright.  

Server was a bit surly and did not offer to remove the onion straws from the bill and said \"she warned me they were different\"

The chairs are grass green metal from the Backbreaker 2000 series and noisy.

Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"The burger was good but everything else was not. Ordered the double decker. Got seated right in the middle of the dining area. I'm not sure why they have 25+ workers at the time we went since it was very slow.  Since we got seated right on the middle there was heavy traffic around our table. Not traffic from the customers but from the servers there. There were only about 3 tables that weren't occupied (including ours). We couldn't even enjoy our food without workers walking pass and bumping our table."}
{"text":"Wow this place is pretty terrible. There wasn't really anything I liked about it here.

Food - was okay, but the portion sizes are small and the price is quite high. The hamburgers are tiny and cost $9-$11 depending on the type you pick. I couldn't get over how small it was for $10 and it doesn't include fries! We shared 1 burger (between two people) one fries, one onion rings and 2 pops and the bill was $35 with tax and tip! 

The fries sucked too, looked exactly like McDonalds fries and the portion was small. Onion rings aren't really onion rings, they are those crispy deep fried onions but they were delicious.

The decor/ambiance here leaves much to be desired. I\"m honestly not sure what kind of look they are going for but the signage is green and white and tries to have a sports bar theme, and the restaurant layout doesn't seem to make any sense.

The service was okay, a bit slow, but not terrible.

Would definitely not come back here simply for the cost."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Saturday evening.. I insisted we go somewhere with TVs for the pens game. I'd heard not so great reviews mostly due to poor service.  That was not the case this evening. We were seated in a booth with clear view of the numerous TVs. Service was great. We ordered drinks and since we were getting hangry, ordered food shortly after. I had the house burger with cheddar cheese rather than \"government cheese\". It was sooooooo good!! My friend had the impossible burger and said it was done better here than at burgatory. The sweet potato tots were unequivocally the best I've ever had. Crispy and soft perfectly seasoned. Had lemon cupcake for dessert.... we couldn't leave because the pens are winning and scored while we are here. High noise level but I would expect that."}
{"text":"Go to wahlburgers they have really good food over there i will go back to wahlburgers again to eat there food over there again"}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be a great visit! Myself and partner went with 2 family members and 2 friends. We were sat outside under the gazebo by the back fence. Once the street lights came on there were bugs everywhere and we noticed all the spiders hanging on the canopy and fake street lights by the plant behind us. When our drinks came out the waitress forgot one. We placed our order and it took 45 mins for the food to come out. When the food came out the waitress did not have the food for the gentleman that did not get his drink. So that was twice he was waiting for his orders. I ordered sweet potato tater tots and got regular. The burgers were ok but in my opinion were very skimpy. I ordered marks favorite because the picture looked so good. Barely any stuffing on the turkey burger. All 6 of us agreed we will not go back. Like I said I wish this experience was better. Step it up Wahlburgers Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. However, it's extremely overpriced for what you're getting and the service albeit friendly is just too slow."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the show and have been wanting to come to a Wahlburgers since they started the franchise.  

My wife and and I decided to get an early start to the day and get in line at about 10:45am since they open at 11am.  At 11 sharp they opened the doors and we were seated immediately.  I ordered a Mud Pie which is something like a mudslide on steroids and my wife went with the spiked lemonade.  Both drinks were delicious. 

For the burgers I went with the BBQ burger and the wife did the melt.  We also got some tots.  Despite some negative reviews, the burgers were cooked to order, hot, quick and very delish.  Zero issues with the burgers.  The tots were average and nothing special.  The server was quick, polite and knew the menu items well and could answer all our questions.  

So, I was leaning to 5 stars but what's holding me back is the pricing.  Two drinks and burgers were about $75.00 with tip so it's easy to say the food and drinks are \"not cheap\".  For us it was something to experience, but for that price you won't want to eat lunch here daily.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Happened to stop here because there really wasn't much of an option in the terminals and had Jenn's chicken sandwich which wasn't bad but wasn't the best I had. The honey mustard dressing was a tad bit sweet but I also am not a fan of honey mustard. Their onion rings were very good with the sea salt and the staff and waiter were very friendly."}
{"text":"Went here on the spur of the moment on a Thursday night. Promptly greeted very nicely by the hostess and told it would be about 15 minutes. No big deal. Looked for a seat at the bar and the server working the bar area pointed out an empty table we hadn't seen. So our 15 minutes turned out to be 5. So far so good. 

The good:
1. Service was good. The server promptly greeted us and gave out table a little extra wiping. Drink orders taken quickly and brought to the table quickly. 
2. The menu is ok. After all, it is a burger place but there are several selections available if you don't want a burger. 
3. Ordered my burger medium and it was actually medium. That seems to be hard to find anymore. The burger was very tasty and really just the right size. 

The not so good ( don't want to say bad because it wasn't. Just eh)
1. $3.50 for a side of tots or fries with my burger? They don't come with? I saw that on the menu and assumed it meant if I wanted a side order of them not pay or you don't get them. Both the tots and my wife's fries were nothing I couldn't get an entire bag of at Giant Eagle for the same price. 
2. The TV's showing what I assuming was the Wahlburg's reality show was a bit weird. It was on at least 2 TV's with no sound. Not that I wanted to hear it but I think having shows that require you to listen on in a bar is stupid. 

Overall I think this place is, meh. Nothing special and nothing to make me want to return. I think the best description is; it's not a place that you plan to go to but rather somewhere you end up at."}
{"text":"Great food, good location (we stayed at Bally's so excellent location for us), decent Vegas prices."}
{"text":"This would never happen in Boston. Put cameras up Donny. Garbage over flowing. And I watched the bartender lick his fingers before putting my swizzle stick In my drying."}
{"text":"We loved their immediate service, fantastic menu options, TASTY FOOD and climate controlled per season!!!!
Well worth it...... Visit when you can, you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 15. Their first reaction was as if they didn't want to accommodate us. When they said it would be an hour we said we don't mind separating. They said they have to keep us together because they can't do a bunch of separate checks. Ummmm ok I never said we were going to do separate checks. I told them we can just have each table just pay separately. 

Mind you I know what you may be thinking. Maybe they were drunk or rowdy. This was at 12pm on a Sunday and I can assure you not one of us had any drinks in us at the time. 

In the end we just left and ate around the corner. If their burgers and service are as bad as their movies I don't think I missed out on much anyway."}
{"text":"This place is great! Liz is awesome! The haddock sandwich is delicious with fresh greens not something you get to see often at a burger place. And that peanut butter adult milk shakes it to die for!!! Sooooo good! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Wahlburgers burgers, and all of their food and service they serve in Hingham & Lynnfield, MA is amazingly impeccable, however, the Las Vegas franchise is absolutely terrible.  I ordered a plain bacon cheddar burger nothing additional on it and I didn't eat it until I returned back at the Bellagio a few hours later only took a bite only to find out they had loaded it with Jalapeños peppers (which I hate) on my burger that was terrible nothing visually and/or close to the quality or the service of the Massachusetts franchises.  I love the food and service in Hingham and Lynnfield is great in Massachusetts burgers look better and taste better minus Jalapeños peppers.  I write this disappointing review with a heavy heart, as these are one of my favorite burger places when we visit Massachusetts."}
{"text":"$4.95 for a Soda, $12 for a soggy Portabello Sandwich, and fries are extra. 
Yes this place is overpriced and food was just okay. Quite honestly if Donny was there, I would've given it 5 stars given the same food. Good thing service here was okay. Then again, this place isn't that big to start off with. There's a gift shop at the beginning of this little plaza. At least if you buy a soda, you get to keep the Wahlburgers plastic green cup. 

Kid's meals here are $7 and your choices are a small burger, mac and cheese, or chicken tenders and can come with fries or tater tots and some other choices. No, it doesn't come with a drink. 

BTW, the coke products tastes a bit off here. So if you don't have to buy a soda, don't buy one. Afterall, you can just buy a ice cream float for $8 and that also comes with a green cup you can take home. If you ask nicely, you can just tell your server to get you a new one instead of rinsing your ice cream float cup. 

Now when they come to LA, I don't need to visit. Thank goodness."}
{"text":"This is not our first time here but first time yelping about it. Love this place. Burger taste yummy and the fries. Every time we are in Vegas we try to make this part of our schedule meals."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Wahlburgers since watching the show and was glad to see them coming to the West Coast so I could try their delicious burgers!
Not usually one to eat much beef, this is one of the few places I order myself a burger,, because the quality of them eat is fantastic, great flavors and cooked well.
I do feel it is expensive and the burgers pretty small, but given the location it is expected.
Fries and tater tots were great, pass on the onion strings, they were cold by the time we got them since they are so thin.
Food was made to order quickly, much better than expected and worth trying out."}
{"text":"While waiting for a flight, with my family we decided to eat here for dinner.  I ordered the melt and I have to say I was not very impressed.  All I tasted was grease.  Dr. Nick would definitely allow Homer to eat this when he wanted to gain an obscene amount of weight.  I also wouldn't go as far to call this a hamburger as it wasn't served on a bun, it was served on toasted bread.  

One of the toppings is government cheese - it's basically kraft singles.  

The tater tots were also nothing more than frozen McCain tots.  If I were Napoleon Dynamite and had a pocket full of these I would give them to my classmate and avoid the kick and smashed tots.  

Believe it or not my daughter's kids grilled cheese tasted better than my burger."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Came here after a jays game and I must say the service was extremely good here and the food was not bad but kind of on the pricey side.

One thing I'll start off with is the fries are kinda like Mcdonald's fries but not as flavourful. I had the poutine and it was good but not enough gravy. Would be nice if fries came with the burger but it's extra.

Tried the Eh! Burger and it was really good, the peamel bacon and sunny side egg on the burger went really well together. Maybe the only thing I would change is less mustard flavour in the sauce. Overall it was a good burger. 

Also had a vanilla frappe milkshake and it was solid."}
{"text":"Stopped by Wahlburgers with the family yesterday on my wife's whim. I dropped them off at the door and parked down Prospect. After I parked at 1:19 PM, I noticed a \"No parking after 2:00 PM\" sign posted by the police. I walked to the restaurant and my family was still standing outside and they said it would be a 15 minute wait. So i went back to the car and drove around looking for valid parking. After 10 minutes, I found cheap parking in the flats as there was an Indians game happening and there were no free parking spots available. 10 minutes later, I made it to the restaurant, but on my way, I texted my wife my order for a shroom burger and sweet tater tots. When I arrived, I walked out to the patio and our server greeted me and asked what I wanted to drink. Upon looking at the drink menu, I ordered an IBC root beer in the bottle. A few minutes later, she returned with my semi-cold root beer.

The entire time we waited for lunch, the server didn't give us any refills or even approach us. My wife got her attention and we got some refills. After 2:00 PM, the Indians pre-game crowd had dissipated, so the restaurant was not that busy. After about 30 minutes of waiting, our food arrived and it was hot and fresh. My double shroom burger was huge and well seasoned. I really loved the burger. The sweet potato tots were very tasty as were the fries and onion rings. Portion sizes were good. The onion rings are really tasty, but an order is enough for two to three people!

I'll be back for another burger, but not during an Indians pre-game."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas Wahlburgers is much different than the experience at the original restaurant outside Boston.  Go to Boston if you want a fish sandwich."}
{"text":"The burgers here are nothing more than an ordinary burger that you could get anywhere else. The burger was Slightly smaller for the price you pay. Our server was really slow. It wasn't too busy that night. I felt like my burger was under seasoned. Cooked perfectly though. I just didn't like it enough to return."}
{"text":"Tried the Our Burger and onion straws.  Very good.  Friendly service.  I would recommend if you're in the mood for a quick burger."}
{"text":"Wish I had better to say but unfortunately I do not.  To summarize......Overpriced burgers and fries.  Just average and not anything special.  Actually kind of let down and feel stupid for paying $100 for four average burgers and fries.  To the management team.... Please do not allow cheap Vegas photos to be taken by that girl walking around interrupting my meal trying to sell me a damn photo of me eating your average overpriced burger.  So disappointed and never coming back here again.  Go to shake shack down near New York New York casino."}
{"text":"So having spent a small fortune in Las Vegas in various hotels with all their restaurants Wahlburgers was TRULY a gem! Granted it's not much to look at but every single item ordered at our table was amazing!!! The staff wasn't overly friendly but I'd probably not be so nice serving food to drunk tourists in 106 degree weather. I love that a complimentary photo was taken and give as well as a keepsake plastic cup! If Donnie and Jenny decide on opening one here in Texas you can almost bet $ I'll be one of their very first customers cause I'm still craving that burger and onion rings!!! Also I really hope Donnie and Jenny are Yelpers so I can drop this hint and suggest San Antonio as your next site...please!"}
{"text":"Wow! We came here on the last day of our vacation and my sister said, \"man if we came here earlier in the week we would have come back here again\"  We all had the Mac n Cheese with bacon and onion rings as a starter. The Mac n cheese was flavorful and very creamy. The onion rings were a little salty but well seasoned My husband had \"the beast\"- huge, flavorful and filling. I had the Melt- the bread was a perfect match for the meat. Brother had the Double Decker and sister had the OUI burger- all winners.  The kitchen messed up our order so it took longer than normal but our waitress Ashley was quick to fix it and helped us out. Next time we come to Vegas we will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming my favorite burger joint. I can't decide whether it's the huge, delicious burgers or the homemade thin 'n' crispy onion strings that pull me back here more! Service is good, food comes out quick, prices are very reasonable, and we never leave disappointed! Definitely worth the trip downtown. The only question I have left is why aren't there more of these?  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and very friendly staff.

Walked here from the mirage to watch the Seahawks game -- they have quite a few TVs in the bar area.

They have a semi-enclosed patio that gets lots of shade as well.

Back to the food; the burger was amazing; the bun was one of my favorite parts.

I ordered a side of onion rings, but they were more like shoestring style --- they were good but hard to eat.

The bartenders were all extremely friendly and prompt. This is a great stop for a burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Excellent service & excellent prices!!! Highly recommend this to anyone that has a chance to go. \"The Beast\" is the shit!!!"}
{"text":"This place is too damn good!

The burgers remind me of homemade. The fries and tots are a a great side and yes the mac salad is legit.  Yes gotta try the mac salad.  Have to...

Thx to the great staff, especially mio amico da Venezia! 

Tutti Buono! Grazie!"}
{"text":"The burgers are decent, but there beer selection was on point! It's a good place to eat and hangout. I thought the price for average sides are over price."}
{"text":"Truly not giving it ONE star to be an idiot. Really feel when you add it all up, its not worth more. Horrible wait time, average ambience, food is NOT good at all for the price and would NOT be worth a repeat visit even if 50% less.  In Dorchester, maybe this flys but in this city ( a mile long ) of 35,000 places to eat, 10000 of which serve MUCH BETTER hamburgers, this place was almost funny to me. No b.s. THE most average nothing hamburger I have had almost ever in my life, including a bowling alley hamburger... Save your money and 60 minute wait time and go ANYWHERE else. Truly wondering what the F Paul is doing on the show when he pretends developing recipes and whatnot because this isnt even remotely restaurant worthy. I pray the food here is just the F U menu and not the real quality served at main restaurant. Literally wasted calories and considering taking up Bulimia due to this lunch."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place from watching the show... very disappointed to say the least with the service, the prices, the atmosphere, and the food especially the hair that was sitting in my girlfriends burger. The set up of the restaurant is not very inviting... There is absolutely no memorabilia of NKOTB or Mark which was something that would be appealing I would think to those fans that follow them. I for one will never eat at this establishment ever again... If the Wahlberg's are serious about the fan experience well then they dropped the ball on this one and need to revisit this restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service was garbage. We travel all over world and again even in Canada the employees are trashy people. The experience was nothing like what is shown on tv! We didn't even eat in the restaurant because the people were ignorant. Were hoping we will find a waulburgers that will give us the experience of the perception given. The waulburgers name is on the line and for their employees to ruin yet another good time with my family is just disappointing. Maybe the pairs location will give us what we're looking for out of the brand \"waulburgers\""}
{"text":"Nothing like shake shack, the service here was pretty horrible. If your in a rush definitely consider grabbing something else.
The food was cooked well and was tasty I personally would have just preferred shake shack"}
{"text":"First time at this franchise. Clean, contemporary and great staff. Went for the double burger, well worth the price. Everything was fresh and cooked exactly how I ordered it. I also added the onion rings, and was surprised of the style and quantity. More like a basket of \"curly onions\". Good, but not traditional by any means.

I would recommend and will be back.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Wahlburgers and I was not impressed with the burger. It came back cold not once but twice. On the third try it was warmer but not hot. The sweet potato tater tots were fantastic. Our waiter was very understanding and helpful so I didn't want to make a big fuss."}
{"text":"Great food!! We had \"The our burger\" Yukon fried and sweet potato tots. Everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Wait was to be 20 mins so we sat at the bar. Good service . The drinks stayed full and the food seemed to come out as soon as we ordered. The melt was very good I added Swiss cheese to the sandwich along with the government cheese lol. The fries were good but honestly couldn't eat may of them by the time I finished the burger. Overall great experience... thanks!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a bad review since, I love the owners Mark, Donnie and Paul, but I cannot give it a good one. I took my mom, and daughter for lunch on Friday. Restaurant seemed very crowded, but we got a seat quickly. Our waiter was ok, but the food was not. I would call it very, very expensive fast food. My mom got a burger with mushrooms and cheese. My daughter and I got the patty melt. We split and order of fries and onion rings. My mom's burger came out without mushrooms, and when she told the waiter, instead of remaking it, he brought her out a little plastic cup with cold ugly looking mushrooms in it. She just put it off to the side and did not put it on her burger. The patty melts were good, but very greasy. The fries which are sold separate were in a small cup for $3.50, not worth the price and the onion rings were not edible. They use red onions cut very thin which is fine, but they were very cold, soggy and they had absolutely no color, they had raw flour coating them. There are too many burger joints out there that is 100x better than this. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Ventured onto the strip today, specifically to eat at Wahlburgers. We ordered the OFD burger, crispy onion rings, and the Mac and cheese with smoked bacon. The burger was perfectly cooked, juicy, and flavorful. The onion rings were crispy but had sections that were overly salted. Ask for a side of Wahl sauce to go with the rings...makes them better. The Mac and cheese was the low point. The cheese sauce was watery and flavorless. The bacon on top was really hard and chewy, more like a jerky than bacon. I'd skip it on the next visit, for sure. 

The service was a little touch and go. Our server took our order promptly but after that, was almost impossible to track down when we needed something. We had to ask another server for a soda refill and the host ended up taking our check because our server was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"Service was terrible! Person you check in with just said how many and inside or outside and just seemed to have a demeanor of \"eh, whatever I'm just here\" and it took about 10 minutes to get seated which was fine. Had to send drink back twice for tasting like diet instead of regular and waitress stated others had complained as well so finally had to go with cherry coke so it tasted right. After ordering, we waited at least 25 minutes and asked the waitress about our food, she said \"we currently have a ticket time of 30-35 minutes\". At least another 10-15 minutes went by, she said our food should be out soon and about 10 minutes later brought us a complimentary basket of onion rings (which is only reason I'm giving a 2 instead of 1 rating). After at least 40 minute wait we got our food, one sandwich was to have a fried egg on it but didn't so that person had to wait another 5-10 minutes for her food to come back out. Food was delicious though. And then when settling our tickets, the waitress had them all wrong w no pop on one and order of onion rings we did buy to be on the one ticket so we had to settle up amongst each other to fix it - she did offer to re-do them but we just wanted to pay and leave"}
{"text":"Wahlburgers customer service saw my comment regarding not having my shirt size when I tried to buy one and they sent one to me, thank you Wahlburgers!"}
{"text":"In wanted to like this place, I love me some government cheese and Marky Mark... but it was very average. Since it tastes fast foodie, they should make it fast foodie...order at the counter, get a number, etc. There really is no need for waiters and waitresses here. But we had good service, maybe because the place was mostly empty. I got the \"Our Burger\" and Doug got \"The Melt\" and we shared Thin Crispy Onion Rings and a Chocolate Frappe. We ordered our burgers done Medium but I think they were closer to Medium Rare but we ate them because we were hungry.They were just very plain tasting and our Onion Rings and frappe were just okay. I can't believe we paid restaurant prices (11-13$) for fast food type burgers.
I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend this place, so many better places on The Strip to get a good burger, don't waste your time here!"}
{"text":"Ehh I have wanted to go to wahlburgers since it first was coming to vegas. Finally I get here and it's opened. The burger was ok nothing to write home about. Typical takeout/fast food place. I compare it to burgerfi and five guys. The secret sauce must be thousand island dressing. The staff is blah and the place is loud. Now I see why this only gets 3 stars as an average."}
{"text":"Politely skeptical at first but curious.  No need to be skeptical, fast friendly service, delicious, cooked to perfection burgers and a Habanerno Bloody Mary was spicy but not distractingly so.  Way to go Wahlburgers?!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed!  I've been a HUGE Mark Wahlberg fan for decades, watch Wahlburgers and was so excitedly eat here, then very disappointed! 

The burgers were bland, the fries were nothing special and service was not great.  No smiling faces, seemed the employees were not happy to have a job there.   Recently I was in Vegas and we wanted burgers, my husband suggested Wahlburgers since he knows I'm a  huge fan of Mark, but I totally declined due to my experience in LA."}
{"text":"Incredible Burger! I went with the BBQ bacon, one Donny's favorites as stated on the menu and it was wonderful can't wait to go back and try it again. Who would have thought tater tots were so wonderful. Thanks Paul."}
{"text":"This place was decent. At the time, I was a vegan and was a little frustrated with options - in the end, the only thing that worked was a portobello mushroom diced up over a salad -- because the bun for the portobello burger contained eggs or milk or something. 

I ended up eating the sweet potato tots, which surely went a little against my diet in some way looking back, but those were freaking orgasmic - if you go, make sure you don't skip 'em.

My non-vegan friends thought the place was good, though they said \"it wasn't anything special as a burger place goes.\""}
{"text":"The food leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered 70.00 worth of food just so we could try everything recommended by our server.  We had the mac and cheese (watery, soup consistency), tater tots, fries (soggy), portobello mushroom burger, Jenn's chicken sandwich, \"our burger\".  The food was served cold and the sauces were served warm (wahl sauce and ranch).   The ketchup bottles left at the tables for self service were sticky, warm and watery.  The only reason I couldn't give 1 star is due to the amazing service. The servers and the hosts were so attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is alright but nothing special, it's basically fast food at a sit-down restaurant with sit down prices. Wife had a burger and said it was pretty good, I had a bowl of chili which was better than expected. Tots were okay as well but nothing special. I've never seen the show so I guess maybe it's a must see if you're a fan? Otherwise, it's okay but go to the nearby In N' Out for a better meal and spend the money you save on a nice drink someplace."}
{"text":"I should first write that I had no idea that there was a tv show surrounding this restaurant. They did show the tv show inside the restaurant; well, the 15 second preview on repeat for the entire time.

That said, the place is SO OVERPRICED. For two drinks and two burgers, our bill was $60. Also, there is a MANDATORY 18% gratuity. Even if you only eat as a couple, like us.

While the food was overall good, albeit fairly average, two things irked me. First, their \"pints\" are not pints. They are glass-sized bottles. $7 for a pint is steep; $7 for considerably less than a pint is scandalous.

The second thing is the mixed drinks: all are $12, and to be honest, it was not only garbage, but it came in a champagne glass. For $12, I would have expected a drink twice that side.

Part of me thinks the prices are so ludicrous because of the tv show. Maybe. Maybe this restaurant is a cash grab on hype. Maybe take your $60 and go to one of many better, more affordable, non-mandatory gratuity joints in Toronto instead."}
{"text":"We went in on the Thursday and it was pretty busy but seem like most of the staff was just standing around talking to one another .I myself ate the Thanksgiving burgers and it was the size of a McDonald's cheese bugers, although it was very tasty but priced way to high for the price .i ordered yellow gold french fries and had to send them back twice and when i finally received my second order of fries they still where cold and hard ..We where super excited for this place to come to vegas but i dnt thing we would be returning. 50.00 for 2 burgers and fries ummm no thank you .."}
{"text":"Never order from take out if you are trying to make a flight. I waited 20 mins and left without my burger... sprinting to the other end of the terminal still starving. Beware."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. DO NOT GO HERE! Bartender took our order.. he came back 10 minutes later with our food. Our burgers were bleeding (even though we asked for well done) and our tater tots were FROZEN! Bartender said that's how the burgers come and got pissed and took our food back. 35 minutes pass still waiting on our food.. table after table receive their food very quickly. We tell him we are still waiting and he replies with \"well that's what you get!\" then goes back and laughs at us with his coworkers. Are you serious?! How do you even have a job talking to a customer like that!? So unacceptable. This place doesn't even deserve one star. Will never recommend this place and certainly will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"Don't buy the hype!  If it wasn't for superstar Marky mark being the celeb driving force this would not exist. Ordered bacon burger and it was ok not worth $13 for burger alone. Did the sweet potatoes tots and they were over sated and soggy, no crunch like they should have. Mac and cheese was ok but not worth $8 for a cup or generic greatness. All
In all don't bother waiting for a table and paying $20+ a person for mediocre food. First and last visit."}
{"text":"Great service and great burgers. We visited on our Anniversary and the staff made sure we were celebrated. Will visit again, hopefully they'll open more restaurants."}
{"text":"3 AM and starving we were in desperate need of food. We were seated right as we walked in and they took our order and within 5 minutes we had our burgers.

Great place for the late night munchies and good service. 
They stack their burger with the meat on top and everything on the bottom. I'm not sure if it made a difference but it was still good."}
{"text":"Actually expected the food to be subpar, as this is a celebrity restaurant. To our surprise when the food was actually tasty! Expensive for what you're getting but really a good burger! Would probably eat her again if in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Mark and Donnie Wahlberg so of course I had to come here on my trip to Vegas!  There was a 15-30 minute wait when we got to the restaurant at noon on a Monday; we ended up only having to wait 15 minutes.  They took our phone number to text us when our table was ready so we got to walk around a bit while waiting which was nice.  

I ended up ordering the Our Burger and added bacon to it.  I'm assuming what's supposed to make their burgers are their sauce and pickles, which honestly I didn't care for.  Once I got to a part of my burger that didn't have any sauce or pickles, I enjoyed my burger more.  Sides are extra - I ended up getting their fries which were just okay.  

The restaurant concept has kind of a weird feel.  It's a sit-down restaurant yet has fast-food touches, such as napkin dispensers on tables and water served in fast food soft drink containers.  There was a woman who came by who offered to take pictures of us \"for their website\" - we declined.  People around us though took her up on her offer and ended up with pics in souvenir frames that actually looked kind of cool.  There were pics of the Wahlbergs on the walls but we were by windows so I didn't get to take silly pics posing with them :p (Diners were sitting too close to the wall for me to get pics.)

My Wahlberg-loving self is glad I finally got to try Wahlburgers.  I've had better burgers though.  Still, it was a-ok and worth a trip just to say I tried it :)"}
{"text":"This is an update to my original post.
The 5 star rating is for the way that Tina Siereveld (director of customer relations for Wahlburgers) took charge &  handled this unfortunate situation.
She actually personally called me (sort of unheard of in today's tech-obsessed society where most everything is handled through email).
She apologized profusely & made no excuses (another refreshing act in today's day & age).
I did also receive an email from Jr (manager at wahlburgers-las vegas).
Both actions were much appreciated & because of the way this was handled, the next time we have the opportunity to go to Wahlburgers, we will give it another chance.
Thank you to Tina & Jr.!!!"}
{"text":"The best burgers I ever had. The BBQ and fiesta burgers are worth the money. Every bite is as good as the first bite you take. So flavorful..."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for average tasting food. Fries were soggy and the burgers are not anything I can't make at home. The seating area is nice and kid friendly. I wouldn't go there again as there are other sports bars and burger places in the same area that are better."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst. Decent. Got the bacon burger (turkey, no cheese). Enjoyable but VERY small for the price. I was expecting more. I was definitely still hungry afterwards. Service also was decent - not a bad experience but they could have been better. Also found food took long to come out. Wouldn't be in a rush to come back but I wouldn't be opposed to it either. If I come back, then I wouldn't do the dining area again."}
{"text":"Let's face it - for the most part, everything in Las Vegas for visitors is expensive.  I'm sure locals know the best deals but for the casual travelers, expect to pay a lot. 
 
That being said, during our 4 day vacation to Sin City, Wahlburgers was easily the best meal we ate.  Over $40 with tip is a little pricey for two Our Burgers, an order of onion rings, french fries and two Cokes, but we left feeling it was worth it.
 
We came during the end of the lunch hour and were told there would be a 15 minute wait for a table, but we could be seated immediately at the bar.  Sounded good to us.  
 
As soon as we sat down a nice young lady took our drink order and then our food order.  My wife and I both feel that the hamburgers we ate at Wahlburger with all the \"fixin's\" including melted cheese, were the best burgers we've had anywhere.  The fries had some kind of special seasoning and were also excellent, so were the onion rings which in some places are called \"onion straws\".  They were thin and crispy and so delicious. 
 
A really nice dining experience."}
{"text":"On the real if yelp had a half star rating then it would be a 2.5/5...

The reason why I put it as a 3 instead of a 2 would be the server...he was cool as hell..however when you paying $20 for a fries and a burger that In N Out still destroys then I'm sorry but this place ain't worth it.

On a side note I don't understand why all these East Coast chains think they can open up a burger spot and charge double even triple of what it would cost for a MEAL at In N Out and still can't live up to the quality.

We had:

BBQ Bacon Burger - Had decent flavor but the quality of everything was on par to something any of the casinos Employee Dining Rooms have with a $13 price tag...

The Melt - Basically a grilled cheese burger in which again they have decent flavor but the quality of the food for that price point was dissapointing.

Yukon Gold Fries - Pretty good but again the quantity for that price is horrible.

All in all I can't reccomend this place because of the pricepoint vs. quality of food. If they lowered their burgers to $6-7 then it mayyyybeee warrants an ok but a $11-15 burger and it doesn't have the same quality as Holstein's...fahget about it...."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  It was like going to Burger King in every way, except you have to wait 30 minutes.  There were 5 of us, we all got burgers.  The waitress asked how we wanted them cooked -- there were 2 for medium rare, 1 for medium and 2 for well.   All five burgers came out well.   Burger is a teeny tiny patty that was over cooked. No flavor. just salty.  Even a McDonald burger is better.   Service was poor. My favorite is when they bring the food to the table and \"hold an auction\".  They yell out the name of the food and hope someone raises their hand and claims it.  Of course there was confusion and we weren't sure if we didn't have each other's food, so the waitress argued with us.   Seriously, just skip this one."}
{"text":"Great food! Staff was on their game they all know what they r doing.
Seemed Little pricey but food was so good it didn't matter. Impossible burger was the best meatless burger I've ever had 
Great place!"}
{"text":"The service was great. It was clean and a good atmosphere. It just didn't seem worth the premium price. $60 plus tip for a patty melt, cheeseburger, and a basket of onion rings is a bit excessive."}
{"text":"Decided that we would have dinner on a Friday evening. They are on the no wait app and had no wait, so why not try it out. They get a solid 4. We were greeted warmly by the hostesses and we were promptly seated. We were waited on by our phenomenal waitress. She was on it. She was there but not overbearingly so. We started with drinks. Hubby got a beer. I chose their white sangria. It was terrific! Not too sweet, not too dry. I got the Thanksgiving turkey burger. It was tasty. They put a mayo and cranberry combo on the burger which provided the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The burger comes with stuffing on it. It was quite tasty. Solid! The hubby got a burger done to his liking with mushrooms and a tomato relish. He said he could have done without the relishy stuff but liked the burger overall. We got the fries, tater tots, and sweet potato tots. I LOVED the sweet potato tots. They were awesome!!! Overall, a solid meal. We would certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Wahlburgers was everything I expected it to be and more. I felt like I was eating a home cooked burger made with love and attention to detail. I dined in early on a Tuesday and was greeted with a smile. After a brief overview of the menu by my server quickly decided to go with the house burger, lemonade and a split order of the sweet potato tots and crispy thin onion rings.   Ingredients were fresh and the burger was made to order.    You can't go wrong with the aforementioned items. It's the money shot."}
{"text":"Just ok nothing fabulous a bit on the dry side. I have a suggestion that you offer low carb burgers on the menu. Hardee's has a great burger in a lettuce wrap. Your waitress replied I wish we offered that too. I had the house burger and fries ok but prefer Hardee's."}
{"text":"I just want to say this place is phenominal ! I had the fiesta burger mac and cheese with bacon OMG . I travel and some soul food restaurants dont put mac and cheese like that . We had an order of onion rings with wahl sauce very tasty . Ive heard rumors that burgers were blan not true they put enough to give it flavor then you can add more salt to your liking. We recieved fast service from Kevin the server Kudos mann . Right across from Jack casino we will definately be back"}
{"text":"Yes, we had to try it because of the show, and because they don't have a location close to home yet. I read all the reviews, and have to agree with most of 'em. I really liked the place, everything about it. Good stuff, absolutely overpriced. But still good, especially for the rare occasion..."}
{"text":"Toronto's version of Shake Shack. Overpriced burgers. Service is slow and usually a long line. It's what you expect."}
{"text":"What a disappointment to say the least. Staff was incredibly frantic and all over the place. Ordered \"Mark's\" favorite; the thanksgiving day sandwich. It's listed as a seasoned turkey patty with stuffing, cranberry sauce and roasted peppers... well, it didn't come that way (thrown together, sad looking patty, no cranberry sauce and no roasted peppers.) I Sent it back and asked for it exactly as listed on the menu. Second burger was an absolute disaster. It's as if the chef was pissed off or somebody back there hated their job. There was mayo and cranberry sauce slathered everywhere on the burger. You literally couldn't pick it up without it dripping all over the place. Two bites and I was over it. For what they're charging it's really a shame, I had expected it to be better with the Wahlburg name attached to it. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you come to Vegas and don't stop here, kill yourself lol Wahlburgers is one of my favorite places to go to in Vegas. I visited on a busy day and sat at the bar, I was helped by RODRIGO and the service was fast which I enjoyed because the bar was busy. I like to pay attention to the bartenders to see how they treat their customers. This guy was on it!!! I ordered the thanksgiving day sandwich and and by his request tried their mac & cheese, it was the best decisions of the day!"}
{"text":"Our group of four showed up around 7:30pm on a Wednesday and were seated right away. The place was busy, but our order was promptly taken and our food showed up at a reasonable pace. My double burger was cooked perfectly medium and the toppings were fresh. My sweet potato tots were crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle. I tasted my wife's regular tots and her hot dog and it was good as well.

Reading many of these negative reviews, I'm not sure what people are expecting from a celebrity burger place with a simple menu. Maybe they watch the show and feel like the food and service should be amazing because it's built up on tv. I've never seen their show and I thought it ranks somewhere in the In & Out, Shake Shack or Five Guys level of burger joints."}
{"text":"For those of you who aren't familiar with Wahlburgers, it's a casual comfort food restaurant founded by the three Wahlberg brothers Mark, Donnie and Paul.  These talented brothers not only act, dance, sing, and have their own reality show (Wahlburgers) but they also know a thing or two about a damn good burger.  Ever since they were kids, they've always had a passion for burgers, comfort food and making girls scream (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch YEAH!!) and so together the boys opened up their first Wahlburgers location in Hingham, MA in Oct 2011. 

The brothers were very excited to finally open their first franchise in Canada this past November 2014 inside the Soho Metropolitan Hotel making it the first North American expansion outside of the original restaurant in Hingham. The location seats 120 and offers a casual atmosphere with a sports bar, seated dining area and fast service counter. 

The menu includes a long list of burgers (custom-grind using 100 percent Canadian beef), sandwiches, salads, tater tots, fries, mom's macaroni salad, and onion rings. Alcoholic beverages are available such as as adult frappes, wahl-coctions, wine, beer and mixed drinks.  A cool feature that is available only at Wahlburgers Toronto is a beer made by Mill Street Brewery exclusive to the Toronto location, it's called the 'Wahlbrewski North' and it's one helluva an IPA!


Here's what I tried:

Thanksgiving Burger (Mark's Choice)
Fresh ground season turkey, stuffing, Paul's orange cranberry sauce, roasted butternut squash and mayo $9.95

This turkey burger isn't around just for Thanksgiving; this bad boy is always on the menu and happens to be my favourite item so far.  I usually don't order turkey burgers because they tend to be dry but this one was quite juicy and full of flavour! All of the toppings really added different flavours and textures and the combination was just incredibly delicious! The taste of the squash especially added exceptional flavour to the burger.

O.F.D (Originally from Dorchester)
8 oz. beef patty, house made tomato jam, bacon, Swiss cheese and sautéed mushrooms $11.95

This big burger was pretty good but not as flavourful as I thought it would've been. The tomato jam was good but quite mild, I would've liked a dollop of BBQ sauce to give this burger a bit of a kick.  The patty itself was thick and juicy and cooked to perfection! 

Sweet Potato Tots $3.50

These are served with a nice chipotle sauce and are pretty addictive.  I've always been a tot fan so it was nice trying them out in sweet potato form. 

Alma's Macaroni Salad
Elbow macaroni, red onion, sweet peppers, parsley & mom's creamy mayo dressing $4.50

This is a classic recipe by momma Wahlberg that the brothers loved while growing up. It was pretty basic tasting and I felt that there was not enough dressing on it.  Perhaps I just got a batch that was lacking dressing...

Truffle Cookie
Gluten-free chocolate truffle cookie $1.95

These warm little cookies look plain but TASTE amazing.  I need to figure out if I can buy these by the bag because they are ridiculously addictive.  They remind me of a flourless chocolate cake, but in a little cookie form.  Highly recommend for a sweet treat after your meal.

Overall I had a wonderful experience at Wahlburgers and everyone that worked there was a complete delight.  I would definitely return to Wahlburgers especially with friends from out of town who want a feel for the city. Starting this month Wahlburgers will incorporate Canadian-themed dishes as part of the 'burger of the month' program and hopefully when they've perfected the 'greatest poutine ever' we will see something like that on the menu."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that you could build a chain of burger restaurants cooking only well-done burgers?  This was one of the driest burgers I've ever had. Poutine was overpriced at $6 for a small cup of fries and gravy. Waitress was gracious and service was fine otherwise."}
{"text":"Well this place is over hyped . But I keep coming here , every time I got to Vegas . The awkward thing was we meet the franchise owner later that night while exploring Fremont street. My co-worker was saying how crappy it was when his like I'm the owner ?"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the TV show so I really wanted to like Wallburgers. Unfortunately, the Las Vegas location.

The menu is more of an express menu without all the options shown on the show.

My Cheeseburger was a little tasteless and the patty fell apart. The onion rings were greasy. They do have very good lemonade though.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great burger  and tater tots!  Ambiance is lively and loud, but you're in Vegas so it's expected. The onion rings are more like onion strings, very tasty. Overall we were all pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"Well, now we can say we've been to Wahlburgers. Once was good enough. 

Overall it had more of a fast food feel than I was expecting. That being said, sometimes you don't want the production of a big sit down meal. It was nice to have a quicker meal, but the experience was a bit underwhelming. I'm glad we went, but probably won't go again. 

Pros: 
-Food was pretty fast
-Servers were nice
-Food wasn't bad
-Shoestring onion rings were awesome. 

Cons:
-They seemed to be having trouble turning tables. We checked in and we're told a 15 minute wait, but we could see empty tables. 
-We're not actually sure who our server was. I don't think we saw the same person more than once. And it took them quite a while to come to our table. 
-The Mac and Cheese was OK. It was enough food, but it came in a paper cup, so you felt like you ordered a side. I actually re-checked the menu, and yep, it was supposedly an entree. If it was played better I might have felt better about it. 
-Sides don't come with the meal and have to be ordered separately."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!!! Went for a midnight snack Tuesday night and went back for the full meal Wednesday. Everything we had was amazing! The mac-n-cheese, the fries, the onion rings, the burgers and the 'wahlburger' sauce were all to die for. Highly recommend it! This was our first visit and not our last!!!"}
{"text":"The burger was really juicy and good. We ordered Paul's fave. The burger tasted homemade and the fries were fresh.  The price is a little high. Fries aren't included in a $11 burger.  The service was mediocre at its best. We sat at the bar and took a while just to get menus. There is no patio seating either. It would be better if the bar was push more outside creating a better atmosphere. The place seems a little cramped."}
{"text":"The burger was great, it tasted like steak. Plus I want to eat everything Marky mark eats so I can look like him."}
{"text":"The food was good, great tasting burger. Miguel, our server was incredible. He went over and above. We have travelled the world and eaten at a lot of incredible places and also some not very good places. He is easily top three servers we have ever had. If Wahlburgers employees people like this all the time you will be in great shape. Hopefully this young man manages his own store one day because he gets it."}
{"text":"I was surprised but maybe I shouldn't have been,I enjoyed the thanksgiving dinner Burger which was excellent had a orange/ cranberry chutney/stuffing,butternut squash  on a Turkey Burger . My wife had the Fiesta Burger chopped Salad and not only was it delicious but large enough for three! At Seven PM the restaurant was clean and full our Server Alexandria P. Was wonderful and efficient a complementary post card photo was offered along with other photos for sale by a professional photographer... great experience when in Las Vegas give them a try."}
{"text":"We got \"The our burger\", double dogs with fries and tater tots. We arrived around 8:30pm and waited 15min to get seated. I'm usually scared to eat cheese burgers because of the grease and the heart burn I get. The fact that I didn't get any stomach issues after eating a cheeseburger was two thumbs up! I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Visited this Restaurante on the 3rd of July.   This holiday is based around hotdogs hamburgers and beer.  They ran out of bud light and HAMBURGERS?!!  We wait over an hour for our check that was wrong THREE TIMES.  The food wasn't anything to brag about.  But they will never see my business again.   Hands down horrible !!!"}
{"text":"Saturday night fight night 5 stars absolutely!!!!
It was so good I had to come back Sunday night after walking the strip, OMG, the drastic drop off from a Saturday night to Sunday night I can't even believe that the same place I have been raving about all day, can have me SO turned off by the food and the service I SWEAR TO GOD, I can't even Believe this is the same place... What The Hell Walhburgers, Mark , Donnie, Paul, Alma, would be offended,  Yesterday was the best bite for bite ever!!! Today I feel like I will never watch Ted again  and I'm so mad about that, because I love quoting Mark Wahlburg movies, as I respect  the Place and position of the Wahlburg family in The Great city of BOSTON AND HOLLYWOOD,  Check your staff!!!! , the Saturday experience, Not what we just had whack ass experience  that  forced  me to write this review Sunday...im so sad not to be able to Rave about  Wahlburgs as I was planning too Once I go back to Cali Smh pissed off Customer/ Friend..."}
{"text":"The food was good I just wish that the \"onion rings\" wasn't onion straws. I was expecting the normal onion rings :/.... Also I wish that they had more options for turkey burgers. I wanted to get the bbq burger version but with a turkey burger and they said I couldn't do that. Maybe if u could pick a meat or type of patty first, then choose the type of burger u want. That would be much better. Other than that it's good and in a good location lol"}
{"text":"We had such a great time! We are from Texas, and were visiting friends in Vegas. It was our first time trying this place, for all four of us. We started off with Long Island iced teas, which were perfect and so refreshing, on such a HOT summer day! Then we ordered the Wahlburger #1, w/fries and onion rings. They cook your burger patty to order. The burgers, fries and onion rings were awesome! We ordered the bacon Mac and cheese, WOW! The staff was very nice and Friendly. Great food at a decent price! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite unguilty non greasy burger restaurants. I stopped by on Tuesday night around 7 PM. There was no line and I was seated right away. It appears to be a self-service place but it is not. I ordered the basic Wahlburger, fries and soft drink. It was such a fresh and juicy tasting burger from meat the bun. Fries were non greasy as well and soft drink is $5 but you get to keep a souvenir cup. This is the best $10 range burger place ever. Parking is not free anywhere near here so I parked at a casino and paid. All worthwhile to eat here again."}
{"text":"Went to wahlburgers last night  for dinner. It was still hot out and the sun was blaring through the windows. There was no cover so depending on where you sit in the restaurant you will have complete cover or no cover at all. Bring your shades just in case.
My brother had the our burger, my mom had a chicken sandwich, and I had the patty melt
I thought the menu was pricey overall with each meal costing around 11-13 each and everything was a la carte.
My soft drink was $4, the side of fries and shoe string onion rings were $5 each and the portions were small
The melt wasn't very good overall. The cheese was barely melted and the mustard in my opinion ruined the sandwich. My mom woke up in the middle of the night to throw up. She blamed the carmelized onions from her chicken sandwich. My brother said his burger was okay overall but nothing special. I would try it once if you are curious about the restaurant and in the area or just fans of the walhburgs which we are. I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"loved the tots and the flavour of my burger was great but the location was underwhelming and looked like the maintenance was ..well neglected.

Staff was friendly enough and service was quick, but for the price, all in all things were underwhelming.

Dare I say Burgers Priest was a step above comparing apples to apples"}
{"text":"2am, needed burgers, and was very satisfied! I must say all the employees were surprisingly so friendly, upbeat, and worked as a team (even though it wasn't very busy). They were so on point even as I looked around to the other areas where they interacted with customers. That was impressive enough to earn a 5 Star. 
We got the bacon burger and fiesta burger. Not as medium as we'd like but it was all delicious. Fries were great, too! For the price, the fries should come with the burger, but it's all good. 

Atmosphere is open and casual. The pop of lime green colors makes the place stand out. Little chilly in the evening for the bar area, but luckily it wasn't too windy in Vegas.  
Thanks!"}
{"text":"Before working a really long day outside in Vegas, I decided I wanted a hearty meal to get me through the day. Even though it was only 10am, when you add an egg to a burger it's basically breakfast right? Loved the breakfast burger here- classic burger with an egg on top. I really liked the special sauce they had on it as well. Cooked perfectly and really juicy!! I also liked seeing marky marks face on all the walls  decently priced for Vegas as well and really friendly service! Glad I stumbled upon this place!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come while on a couples trip. Very disappointed. Burgers were not cooked like we ordered. My sister ask for medium it came out well done. Manager seemed like they had been having issues all day, but did nothing to correct our issues really. Mediocre quality at best."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve and we had to try this out I had the double cheese while the rest of my family had the our burgers. Mine was cooked perfect medium but one in our party ordered medium well but it came medium as well. The onions strings were nice, tots and fries were ok. I also had Almas mac salad which seemed to be lacking in some seasoning and was a little dry. Prices are on par with all of the other big name burger joints on the strip, if you want a cheap burger go off strip."}
{"text":"While on vacation in Vegas we stopped at Wahlburgers. We arrived around the lunch hour, and the place was hopping. Staff told us it would be approximately one hour to get a table. They ask for a cell number to notify you when your table is ready.

We sat at one of their outdoor tables to wait. The outdoor tables do not have table service. While waiting two seats opened at the bar, which we quickly snatched. 

Once seated at the bar, staff walked by and didn't even acknowledge our existence. After the 7 to 10 minute mark, we employed a technique that has worked in the past. My wife calls the restaurant and speaks with a member of management. She explained that we had been seated at the bar for some time with no service. We were approached a short time later by the manager who apologized for the lack of service. The bar staff apologized several times as well.

I ordered their grilled chicken sandwich. Be mindful that the sides are extra, not included with your sandwich. Our food arrived in a 5 to 7 minute time period. As I was looking over my sandwich, I noticed a small patch of mold on the bun. When the waitress returned I asked politely if I could get a different sandwich. They were very nice about getting me a second sandwich. The chicken sandwich was very tasty, with it's buttery toasted bun and well seasoned chicken.

When it came time for the bill, they removed my sandwich and our two drinks from the bill. I thought this was a fair resolution to the issues we experienced.

I will give Wahlburgers another chance. Maybe next time will be at one of their other locations."}
{"text":"Sadly, unimpressed! Waiter was not pleasant. Felt like he did not care about us at all. Had to ask for refills and utensils multiple times. Also some mistakes on our order. Bummer!"}
{"text":"The turkey dinner burger was delicious but kind of expensive for just a burger. No sides come with it, but really tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Wahlburgers since I found out they opened. I was in town for a wedding and took the wedding party after the wedding to grab a bite to eat after the wedding on Saturday night. (Group of 8) After being greeted by the hostess I was directed to order at the counter. I told the my group to place their order and then find a seat inside since we are such a large group. My bill was $110 and we ordered items from a burger, chicken strips, mac & cheese, tater tots, sweet potato taters, fries, chicken sandwich and more. As we sat we were told since we ordered at the counter we had to sit in their patio even though we were directed to order at the counter by the hostess. We went outside and found table and chairs piled on the side which we had to put together ourselves with no assistance from the employees from Wahlburgers. Then security of the area told us we as the group were not allowed to put it together and were condescending (Mark Security). I was confused because the employees from the inside were looking at us but not assisting. I then asked the hostess to help us and still after 15 minutes no assistance. We then received our food and 3 of our orders were wrong. We brought the items back and were told in a condescending tone why are we coming back inside and what did we need. Obviously with a burger at hand there was something wrong. I then directed to speak to a manager and expressed my disappointment with he service and that the burger was supposed to not have cheese and several items that were wrong with our order. Tater tots were soggy, burger was mediocre and service put me over the top of why I gave this place a 1 star. I hope management can review this and help with quality of food and service and help train with customer service."}
{"text":"Food was just ok and the place was too small and over crowded. Heard rave reviews about the Mac and cheese since my sister had it in Boston.  It was disappointing. Had no flavor. :(  she was bummed since she recommended it but it fell flat. Maybe because it's Vegas and nothing I ate there was convenient was impressive. I would have rather went to White Castle."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Spent a week in Vegas, attempting to try as many burger places as possible. Went around midnight and it was busy but not crowded. We were seated right away. We were a party of 8. Ordered a bit of everything off the menu. Our waitress was really great!!

The best part of my meal was the Spindrift ice cream float. That's it. I ordered a burger with no bread (I'm gluten free). When my plate arrived, it looked like a giant salad. Someone had taken the meat patty and cut it up into tiny pieces, like I was a toddler. Weird. The greens were fresh.But they didn't have any type of dressing or flavor. I had to hunt for the pieces of meat. The meat was pure grease. No flavor. I had also asked for avocado spread and extra pickles. I didn't receive either. They were brought out to me later. Avocado was fresh but the homemade pickles were vile! Someone made them incorrectly. I've pickled things myself and made mistakes. Seems like they got the ratio of vinegar wrong. They were not edible.

Overall, felt like I wasted my time, money and calories. With so many great places to eat in Vegas, I doubt I'll ever return."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for a table because it gets busy. I got the melt burger with the sweet potato fries and thin crispy onion rings. The burger was a lot smaller than the bun in came in but the homemade pickles were delicious. Then my crispy onion rings came out cold so I had to ask them to reheat them. The sweet potato tots were really good and don't forget to ask for some sriracha ketchup to dip them in! Overall you're going for the celebrity name. I wouldn't care to go back."}
{"text":"Great place food is really good but the pricing of the food is outrageous lol i can actually get food as good or better at easier to access places. If money is no biggie then for sure eat here it's my only gripe."}
{"text":"Our service was friendly, but the food took a while to be served because they were so busy and backed up. I had the Dad's basic burger 1/3 burger, onions, Paul's signature wahl sauce & housemade pickles with tomato, lettuce and white cheddar cheese and a side of sweet potato tots. Our daughter had the kids mac 'n cheese which they just served cooked pasta topped with a little melted cheese and bacon - it was okay, not enough cheese and the cheese was not mixed together with the pasta unlike traditional baked mac 'n cheese. The burgers, sweet potato tots, mac 'n cheese were just okay - nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, and unfortunately, it was very disappointing. I ordered the Thanksgiving sandwich. The server asked, \"With everything?\" and I said, \"Actually, no mayo, thanks for asking!\" Needless to say, it came with mayo. Normally, I'd just scrape it off, but that also would have scraped off the butternut squash and cranberry, leaving me with a plain turkey burger. The server immediately saw when she walked by and brought it back to the kitchen. I didn't see her for about 20 minutes, when she brought the check. My husband had long finished his burger, which I told him to eat, no use in having a cold burger, and I figured it wouldn't take long to bring back my order. I informed her I had never received my sandwich, and just at that time a guy wandered by with it. By this point, I was done and ready to leave, and she removed it from the ticket. Very poor and disorganized service."}
{"text":"Food was great! However the service was horrible we waited 10 min before our server even acknowledged us. And once we ordered, it was as if we were invisible to our server. God came out wrong and we had to ask the other staff for refills, to go boxes and our check."}
{"text":"For this section of the terminal, for sit down food - this is the better choice.  1)  Not crowded as it's far way, 2) Very nice comfortable bar chairs, 3) Service was attentive & good.

Even though the focus is on burgers, there are healthy choices like decent salads.   Tried the turkey burger & fries.  Not bad!   

Good place to hang while waiting for your flight - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not sure why or friendly friends in Canada have gave this place a low rating I was surprised how good it was, burger wasn't wimpy had a great flavor and the sauce on burger was great and that orange creamsicle drink was off the hook."}
{"text":"The mediocre burger surpassed only by the horrible french fries and the crappy service. Do yourself a favour dumpster dive.

It really isn't much more to say"}
{"text":"I had dinner here a couple weeks ago and I was disappointed. There's a lot of hype behind the food here and I just thought it was mediocre. I got the sloppy joe and that was decent but my husband got a burger and it reminded us of a 5 Guys style burger but not quite as good. For sides, we had the tater tots and the Mac and cheese. Both were mediocre. On the positive side, the space is very nice, they have a lot of outdoor seating upstairs on the balcony, you can put yourself on the wait list through Yelp, and the service was friendly. Also we didn't leave there smelling like burgers, which was surprising. We might try it again but aren't rushing to go back."}
{"text":"The food was not bad. Our server however was disappointing. My dining companion had the haddock sandwich. It was very dry and they did not offer any tartar sauce or other condiment to go with the fish. There was ketchup in the table but she didn't want ketchup on her fish! I had a classic salad. It was very good and a large portion. I wished we'd split it. When we asked for a fork the server brought one and laid it on the table in passing- really dropped it. Rude! I expect more from a tourist town. He did not seem as if he really wanted to serve us. Also beware the sodas are almost $5."}
{"text":"Right by Bally's on the strip.  It's sort of small, but does have outdoor seating.  Service when we went was spotty because of a few bigger groups.  For burgers its a little pricey, but it's on the strip and Marky Mark needs to make money - lol."}
{"text":"We gave this place a second try after our  experience the day before. I'm so glad we did because we all had such a great time! (Thanks Tina!) We were greeted by a lovely host and sat immediately, coincidentally in the exact same booth as the day before. I think his name was Peter? Nice guy, came over immediately and brought us all waters before we had the chance to order our drinks.  Our waiter, William (Bill), was AWESOME!!! Didn't skip a beat, he was totally \"on it\" the entire time being helpful, quick, attentive and funny. Great server. 

All 4 of us ordered \"THE MELT\", which was sooo good. Everything, including the Yukon gold fries came out quick and best of all, nice and steamin' hot! The chili w/ cheese, is by far my favorite item on the menu. It comes out so hot (not spicy hot, I'm talkin' temperature) and it's just the best. It Literally stays hot the whole meal, so if you take a while to eat and your fries lose their warmth, dip those babies in the chili and it's like they just came out of the fryer. Lol. Love This place & can't wait to come back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I could have given this three stars or four stars.   I went with four due to the taste of the burger and the crispy ness of the tots.  

The place is always slammed and just know there will be a wait.   The staff hustles and the place is full of energy.  There were 5 of us and we all enjoyed the food.  My burger was properly cooked, well presented and tasty.  My tots were amazeballs!   Crispy, hot, well seasoned and delicious.  Satisfying meal overall. 

The place is very busy but did not feel crowded like some celebrity spots in Vegas.  Also know that you are going to pay $13 for an $8 burger.  It is a Wahlburgers so there is cost for it being a celebrity food spot.  I was not offended by the cost but it was in the higher end of what you want to spend. 

If I want a burger, there are other places I would go from a value perspective.   If I have friends in town that want a burger on the strip his would be an option."}
{"text":"After a night of exploring the city waulburgers was the best bet we made! It was great because who doesn't want a burger at 2am. As a vegetarian I had the Portobello mushrooms burger and it was a parade in my mouth. So good... my bf also had a burger... and he loved it. We also ordered onion rings... I hate onions and I loved it. It was cut so thin and crunchy .. amazing. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Right on the strip by Ballys. Line to get in, very busy so we went to bar for no wait. Everything is priced so burger fries and drink separate and not cheap. $12 burger $5 fries and $5 drinks with souvenir plastic cup. But I would go again, really great burger cooked perfectly although seemed a bit oily and it got on the bun and it tastes great. I got the onion strips really thin and deep fried. Not somewhere I would go often because if the price but you have to try. My least favorite was crowded and pricey. My favorite was taste and you can modify with no problem. I had BBQ KJ us BBQ add Buffalo sauce and I added grilled onions for $1."}
{"text":"Bland bland patty, crumbly bun , stale fries for about 20$ including a drink and tax and tip . Run don't walk away from this place . SMH ."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.

I had company in town and they are fans of the tv show, so when I mentioned that there's a Wahlburgers in Toronto, we had to do the drive into town to check it out. 
We arrived on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm..the place was packed. We were told by the very friendly hostess that the wait time was substantial (as there were 8 of us), but we were free to order ourselves and dine upstairs. This is the option we took.
I ordered 2 BBQ Bacon Chessebugers, 1 Tater Tots, 1 fry, 2 pops....bill came to $36.05. Seriously...$36.05.

So....it's very similar to 5 guys...you order your meal and then wait for your order. Time from ordering to the meal coming out was just over 20 minutes.  While waiting, 1 customer brought his burger back complaining it was cold. The girl behind the counter asked what was cold, the meat or the bun. He burst out laughing and said \"all of it\". She then asked the question again.....? WTH? It took over 10 minutes for a \"warm burger\" to come up. The girl working the counter kept reminding the kitchen to rush his order...and a kitchen staff member yelled back (and we could all hear it) that she'd get it \"when he was ready to give it to her\" and that he \"couldn't cook the meat any faster\". While this was going on, another customer brought her order back as it was incorrect (they didn't give her what she ordered). She had to wait at least 10 minutes to get a replacement. The manager was apologetic to both individuals and did offer free fries to both of them as compensation for the error. 

Anyways...on to our order.

The burger itself was very dry, which is odd because the burger meat is moist. The meat itself is tasty...and although it looks small, it is filling. The jalapeños (there were 3 of them) were very mild, the cheese (white government cheese) melted off the top and surrounded the burger, the bacon..el cheapo.....it was 1 thin strip (couldn't even taste it)..overall, the burger was a huge let down. Fries were on the cool side...definitely not hot. Tater tots reminded me of the ones you get at Burger King for breakfast...Yikes. 

Overall, a huge disappointment. 

Won't be back.

We had friends with us (a family of 6...2 adults, 4 children)  They ordered 2 melts, fries, onion rings, 3 smahlburgers.....5 pops. Bill came to just over $60. They were shell shocked and the kids did not like the burgers at all. She also said the onion rings were odd...they're not standard fare...very little breading and she said they were pretty flavourless. Both adults said they were disappointment with the meal and that they won't go back, even if in the area.

I guess the novelty of the owners is the draw...it may be enough to get people in the doors...it won't keep them coming back. 

Free refill on pops,....."}
{"text":"Service started bad,  as I've never seen a bartender move that slowly.  It was about 10 minutes before we even got water,  then ordered food.  A different bartender took over our order and he was good! Food was good.  I had bbq burger,  and fries.  Girlfriend had thanksgiving dinner sandwich and tater tots.  Burger was a little smaller than I expected for the price.  It was about a $6 to $7 burger in my opinion.  It was $13.  Little tray of fries was additional $5, iced tea was $4. 

Overall the food was good,  service was good,  besides the first bartender. The problem was the price. It was over $50 for lunch for 2 people.  There are much better burger spots on the strip for that price."}
{"text":"Good food, a little pricey only because you have to buy everything individually, like fries don't come with burgers"}
{"text":"No offense, that was the most generic burger and fries I have ever had. The servers are what earned a second star, they were very positive and friendly."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't yelp this review earlier.  I went to this location a couple of weeks back with my girlfriends.  We came to eat around 7pm where their was a wait for a table, but we were lucky enough to snatch four seats at the bar.  Service was great.  Our bartender was very attentive with our drinks and food. He gave us great recommendations of what is good for our dietary restrictions.  Burgers were fantastic.  One of my girlfriends who is a vegetarian tried their non-meat burger and she said it was the best burger she ever tasted.  When she looked at the table, her eyes shot out of sockets and didn't realize she paid 18 bucks for it. BUT she said she would go back and pay for it again b/c it was that good.  I must say, if you are a Wahlberg fan and have watched the show, there was an episode where they were trying to better their fries.  They still need to. Not up to par compared to other restaurant chains. I'm a big burger fan and fries play a key part of the experience of a good burger.  Fries where not crispy and lacked flavor.  Complete opposite of the burger.  Bun, meat and the extras were great. Had to knock a star on that piece.  Sorry, I'm a french fry nut! Overall, looking forward to visit again and try some additional things on their menu, especially their shakes!"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with the food. For it being a chain restaurant it had decent burgers and fries. Be warned that this place is crazy busy and that you will be waiting before getting seated probably. The staff are pretty fast with getting everything to you. I just had the regular burger."}
{"text":"It awesome hamburgers and tater tots!!! Fast and friendly service!!! The wait was about 15 minutes. It's a really cool place"}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed in this place. My mom and I were super excited to finally try this place out as she's a huge fan of the show and I like trying new things. We sat at the bar and all of the hostesses and bar staff were great and super accommodating. We got our drinks and then each ordered the \"Our Burger,\" mine well done and my mother's extra extra well done (basically we don't like pink in our burgers). Once we received our food we were astounded with how big they were and asked for a knife to cut them in half to better eat them, but once we both cut into them we both realized neither were anywhere near well done. We talked to the bar staff and they felt bad about it and immediately sent the burgers back to be cooked properly. They even said it was explicitly written on our order of the well done requests. They apologized as it was their fault and that's fine, mistakes happen. But then finally we got our burgers back and what we expected was beyond ridiculous. They took the meat off the burgers and placed them back on the grill and tried to cook them to their version of well done then put them back together with the buns and condiments that we had already cut into. Their female manager on duty (unsure of her name) proceeded to bring back our burgers, that were a hot mess, and never once asked if everything looked alright or anything. She just placed them with an attitude and left. We decided to just deal with it and try the burgers to end up taking a few bites and still encounter a lot of pink so by this time we were done. I asked a hostess for a different manager and she was kind and attentive and said she'd get him to come out. He never did (pretty sure his name was Miguel). He let his bar manager take care of it and didn't make an appearance himself when it had to deal with his kitchen staff and not his bar staff. The bar manager, Vinnie, was great and took the burgers and a round of drinks off our tab but the main manager should have made an appearance to fix the issue instead of it being erased like that. I will never return to this establishment with the treatment we encountered. The only good thing was the bar staff and their drinks, but even that couldn't get me to raise this one star rating because of how awful their main management is."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place! It was really delicious and awesome! I love Mark Wahlberg so to actually go to a family owned restaurant of his was cool! The burgers are so tasty and the bun was soft! I'm usually a fan of In N Out but this place outshines it! Good thing they don't have one in Cali otherwise I'd be there every week! Lol"}
{"text":"Overall it was just \"ok\". I know they are newly opened and there is expected to be some kinks in the flow of things for a little. So we chose to go at about 230pm on a Thursday expecting things to be slowed down a little and for the most part it appeared to be so. My biggest issue was the temperature of my burger and the inattentive service. I would have said something about the temperature of my food but the server never came back to the table. Didn't get a refill on our beverages until we were done with our food and paying the check. The fries and sweet potato tots were awesome, they came out very hot and fresh. I chose the thanksgiving day burger, it wasn't as special as it sounded in the menu. First, it was cold... like, pulled from the fridge cold. The burger advertised that it came with stuffing on the sandwich, I didn't see any underneath my clearly flattened/squashed turkey patty. Mostly just the sauces and the squash purée, it was a let down. My partner's burger (the beast) came out steaming. I was for sure jealous. The fries were my favorite part. I would be willing to go back in a few months to try something different, but I won't be making it a priority. Overall, it wasn't as good of an experience as we had expected it to be."}
{"text":"The beast burger was delicious, even for those who don't like blue cheese it doesn't have that blue cheese taste. The burgers were all good but the sides were a little luster, needed seasoning. Overall too pricey for what your getting but if your into tourist spots the inside decor is really cute, especially the movie titles on the ceilings"}
{"text":"I like the Wahlburger brothers so it's worth the experience. The food is alright, really nothing to brag about. We've tried the mom's sloppy joe, thanksgiving day sandwich, portobello sandwich, BBQ bacon and the beast. If you like to post picture on social media it's worth going, when you enter the restaurant to your right there's a huge picture of the brothers and their mom. Picture perfect."}
{"text":"A little grease with my Tator Tots? A heart attack waiting to happen. This is after I had to send back first time being ice cold, 2 days in a row. I send back my bacon cheese burger after requesting my bacon crispy to avoid limp grease pieces of bacon. I had to return the burger and it came back in perfect tasty condition the second time. A bit of training in the kitchen by the food service/kitchen manager is in order at this location! Junior the manager was very apologetic and Emma at the bar was wonderful."}
{"text":"I came in to have a quick burger before a show at Second City. I think the last time I came was after a blue jays game. 

I ordered the O. F. D. Originally from Dorchester. This burger gives you a whopping 8oz beef patty. Wahlburger is known for their gourmet burgers so for the price your paid, expect a juicy patty. I thought the bread of the burger was better than the typical hamburger place. But you have to come prepared that you're here for a gourmet burger because you're paying a hefty price for just the burger. No fries or drinks yet!

The potato tatters are made fresh to order and it's unique to this restaurant so if you like tatters, then you'll want to order them here. They also have sweet potato option too!

I thought the burger was alright though. I didn't find the burger specifically interesting or taste that spectacular."}
{"text":"This place is located in terminal 1 US Departures near Gate 67 across from the Tim Hortons. Two things lured me in there - I didn't want to pay $21 for burger and fries at the Hearth by Lynn Crawford (I like her but it's only a layover so I don't want to spend that much) and I was intrigued as embarrassingly enough I've seen the related reality show for this which also plays on loop in the restaurant. Anyways the 1/3 lb (5 ounce) Burgers are topped with Paul's signature Wahl sauce, dill pickles, government cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion for $9.95 and side of tater tots $4.50. 

The burger patty didn't haven't much flavour and was a bit dry. Overall it was ok with the toppings. The signature sauce complimented it but wasn't memorable or a stand out. Was wondering what government cheese was - it's really American processed cheese. The bun was soft and veggies were fresh. The tater tots were kinda pricey and you don't get that much. It was pretty bland unless you dip it in ketchup. Taco time mexi fries are better. :p

For the airport it was ok for a sit down meal under $20 per person after tax and tips. But I wouldn't go running back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner and drinks while visiting some friends on the strip. Amazing burgers and even better service from our bartender Patti!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and sides.  Really fun place to grab some good food, a drink and watch some people walk by."}
{"text":"Great place to check out if you are looking for a bite on the vegas strip. Burgers were very tasty! We also tried the onion rings and mac n cheese which were very good! It's a very casual burger joint with a full bar in the restaurant. The place was very busy but even so, the service was great! I would love to come back and try other items on the menu. I was surprised at how reasonable the prices were for a place on the strip. Compared to other restaurants on the Vegas strip , we got so much food here for our money."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal, especially my burger, while visiting Las Vegas. Courtney at the bar gave excellent service and if I go back to Vegas we will have to return!"}
{"text":"Slooooooooooooooooooooow kitchen. Server not attentive to our order -- 45 minutes or more for food to arrive."}
{"text":"The burger here was delicious. We got the OFD, freshly ground beef topped with Swiss cheese, mushrooms, and an amazing tomato jam. The burger was cooked well with perfectly melted cheese. We also ordered some fries which were fairly standard, but nothing to complain about.

One of the highlights of the meal was our server Gail. She took the time to offer us Wahl Sauce, cut our burger in half since we were sharing, and make great recommendations. All of this was done without us even having to ask. She made the entire experience enjoyable,!so a big thank you to her! 

If you're at the airport, this is the best choice you can make in terms of food, come check it out!"}
{"text":"I thought it was good..wished they had a veggie  burger..my mom was happy they had a gluten free bun..I would get back again.,"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger togo and walked 5 minutes to the nearest Starbucks to eat it and burger was not hot at all! Not sure if the patties are cooked to order but it felt as if it was cooked earlier.  Meat was undercooked on a medium (a little too red) . Burger was also very greasy that it took me 3 times to wash my hand with soap to get the smell out.  

Toppings and size of burger gives it potential if only cooked properly."}
{"text":"I had the regular \"our burger\" and added grilled onions. It was super good especially since we were all hungover. The waiter asked if we wanted fries, Taylor tots or onion rings and I asked for onion rings. When they came they were more like those thin onion straws. Still very good just not what I expected. Over all pretty bomb and our waiter had a fun personality."}
{"text":"I was skeptical but the burger was really good and the tots were cooked perfectly!  It's Vegas so everything is expensive but to pay $4.95 for a side of fries or tots is ludicrous and stopping here was a one time deal.  The menu selection was decent and my food came out super fast."}
{"text":"Wahlburgers is a Boston burger restaurant owned by chef Paul Wahlberg in partnership with two of his celebrity brothers Donnie and Mark.  

There are 14 locations, but only 1 in Nevada... and this one is located in front of the Bally's hotel and casino, near Starbucks closer to the casino. Their menu is simple: burgers, some salads, sandwiches and sides.  They even have a meatless burger.
  
The restaurant has indoor and outside dining, or if you don't want to wait, you can grab a stool at the bar, which can be both indoors and outside.  We were told the wait was going to be about 1/2 hour, but a spot opened up at the bar.  The down side of eating at the bar is there's no place for a handbag (if you are carrying one).
  
The food was very good, and quite filling.  Burgers are made to order, and the meat cooked to the temperature you desire.  I had medium rare, and it was just right.  

The drinks were generous, but so was the price.. almost $5 for a soda.  Good thing it was refillable, and the cup was sturdy enough to keep as a souvenir.  Giving it 4 stars but pricey."}
{"text":"Going into the meal- we knew it was going to be good, but we were blown away with how delicious it all was! Probably one of the best burgers I've had and the onion rings are to die for! The staff was very friendly and extremely attentive the entire time. It's in a great location downtown so it's a great fast and easy dinner before doing anything in the downtown area."}
{"text":"In town for #imex17 stopped in for a famous burger - they really are great! And service was excellent! Thanks"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I am a fan of the show. Unfortunately the food was not the greatest. Service was excellent though, we were greeted and seated promptly. Waitress was attentive and checked on us multiple times. Decor was fun and felt welcoming. Food wise, my fiance ordered the bbq burger and a cesar salad. I ordered the Our burger with a side of fries and the cookie frappe. We also ordered the mac and cheese to sample. Burger buns were on the cold side and the patty was kinda small and tasteless. Not juicy at all! I think the burger to bun ratio is a bit off, too much bread vs. meat. Cesar salad was a bit tasteless and I think it was due to the fact the lettuce was still wet from being cleaned which diluted the dressing and made the lettuce limp. I would say the tastiest items were my frappe and the mac and cheese. I'm glad they took off the automatic 18% gratuity that I had been reading about because even without it our bill seemed quite expensive for 2 burgers and a couple of sides. Compared to some of the great burger joints in Toronto, Wahlburgers isn't up to par."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were walking the Strip when she saw the Wahlburgers' sign. She loves the show and always wanted to try the burger. So, we walked in. The food and service was outstanding. Our server Rob was friendly, funny, and had great customer service skills. I see him managing his own store soon. While eating, the Manager (Edgar) came over to make sure everything was going good. He made us feel soo welcomed to be there. I would recommend you to stop by and enjoy the great time. We will be going back.... Make sure to request Rob for your server."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations. Sadly our party was very disappointed in the food.  The show is great but the food does not live up to the Wahlburg name. I love all of Mark's movies but his brothers food sucks.  I don't want to drag on about the bad, but overall we order 4 different burgers and they all were dry and the cheese wasn't even melted. The tater tots tasted like they bought the frozen ones from the supermarket and used those. The onion rings became very heavy after a few mins. The chili we ordered had a funny taste (Wendy's chili's is better.) Overall service was quite good, however the food is what will be the downfall of this place. If Joe Schmoe opened a restaurant and served this food he'd be closed in a few months, because of the name they may stay open a little longer. Our bill came out to almost $100 for 4 ppl...way overpriced. We could've gone to In n Out and had a burger with fries and drinks 1000x better for 4 ppl for $20. If you want something higher end hit up Shake Shack or In n Out. If you come here you'll feel ripped off."}
{"text":"pros:  great staff.  location.  resteraunt itself   was nice.

cons:  an 11 dollar burger that completely underwhelmed.  Nothing special about it in any way.  Did not fill me up and was mediocre at best.  then charged me 4 dollars for fries ?! WTF ??  and 2 bucks extra or a avocado spread.  Add the 8 beer and i left feeling i wasted 27 bucks.  But lesson learned."}
{"text":"Try the jenn burger , thanksgiving in your mouth and sweat potatoe tots are the bomb ! My mom loves watching the show & now I can try the food. My Hun had some manly burger called Paul's favorite \" our burger \" which was delicious. Price is reasonable & hot food . Loved it.."}
{"text":"Went with friends who all wanted to go. Worst burger I've ever had. The sauce, how the meat was over cooked and the tots were saturated in grease. I got the sweet potato tots and just one bite oozed grease. The staff looks great, the menu does not. Pass!"}
{"text":"It's gotta be tough taking guff in reviews from drunken, over-entitled jerks that give one star ratings because they weren't seated before the five groups that arrived before them! I came here for the first time on Friday night with a couple other guys and it was the best burger I've ever had. It was actually cooked the way I ordered it (medium rare) Super-tasty! One of my friends ordered his burger well-done and said it lacked flavor, so maybe there's something to be said about avoiding over-cooked orders (order at least medium or medium rare!). Service was friendly, attentive, and helpful. I was a bit sad to see them close about 15 minutes early the next night - I was hoping to place a quick to-go order before wrapping up for the night. I'll certainly be back if ever given the opportunity!"}
{"text":"Blaring top 40 music midday immediately dropped the rating; mediocre food locked it in. I guess it's based on a reality show about the Wahl family, but that doesn't excuse the fact that the entree I got (Mom's Sloppy Joe) looked and tasted like something my 9 year old concocted. Prices are steep for what you get; beer is ridiculously pricey relative to what they offer. Just keep walking past this place... don't bother."}
{"text":"It a fan but I am happy they let me turn my burger into a salad. They had a few different beers on tap which was nice. I like the bar area and they have power outlets all over. The staff didn't seem happy and it showed"}
{"text":"Ok. The place was cool.  But. It's just a $11 dollar burger.  Really. Nothing special. Just a burger. ! 
Bought Collectables , they are cool but a little pricy 
They did give my grandson a free backpack and a t shirt and cards.  
That was way cool of them.  

Ty"}
{"text":"Because I still think I'm going to marry Donnie (despite both of us being happily married), I had to go check it out. No Wahlberg sightings, but the food was better than I anticipated after reading some reviews. 

My daughter had kids Mac and Cheese which was made with penne noodles bacon and cheddar and I had a few bites and it was delicious. She also had a root beer float which she downed. 

I had the thanksgiving turkey burger. It was really delicious but I was disappointed in the size of the burger (think McDonald's size). The stuffing, cranberries and butternut squash was perfect on it. My husband had the triple burger and said it was delicious but also not \"big\" for a triple. We all split sweet potato tots which were awesome. 

I had a Fluffanuttah adult milkshake which was really super awesome but really super expensive for the size ($15)

I'd definitely return, but like I said - don't go in starving because you won't leave completely filled, but it will definitely taste good."}
{"text":"Okay so not many vegetarian options, but damn! The portobello Mushroom sandwich was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"The interior design is very low budget, I have seen better looking McDonald's. The fish sandwich was very good ."}
{"text":"the food was pretty good. fish sandwich and turkey burger taste good.  onion rings were cold.  fries were the best thing we had. warning****** they are shady when it comes to drinks.  they automatically charge 6$ for the souvenir cups!! a 60$ meal cost 85$. 4 star food 2 star service and the drink bs."}
{"text":"Wahlburgers. 

The long wait ended up being of no use as we took over some bar seating right before we were due up. Regardless, the hostesses seemed a bit overwhelmed by the rush. Our server was the opposite...meaning great. Quick and attentive. Knew her stuff. 

The Wahl...burgers
They're arranged alright. They reminded me a bit of the burgers you can find at The Habit but the problem came with the meat. They need to get a new distributor out at their Vegas location because it just did not taste right. I don't expect kobe beef but I do expect a clean taste that doesn't end in a bitter note after the culmination of ingredients. 

The fries were okay. No special seasoning or special cut, average. The alcohol choices were your normal things + 1 or 2 decent draft beers. 

Although my experience wasn't the worst...with Wahlburgers in other spots around the country I would advise to try them elsewhere. It could be another example of the Whataburger problem...sucks in Arizona but amazing in Texas. So maybe sucks in Nevada but amazing in Massachusetts?"}
{"text":"Had a great experience with Holly at Wallburgers - we accidentally sat at the \"sit down\" section - not knowing the back part to order was only take out or take upstairs - instead of chasing us out or upstairs - she allowed us to stay where we sat - and took care we weren't bothered to move! We know now how it works - was not clear coming in as there was no hostess there to tell us - after walking all morning I really appreciated her kindness and understanding - we need more kind, thoughtful and friendly people like her in the World - never mind just in Wallburgers - you got a good one boys! Give her a promotion! Thanks Holly - if only I had more loonies and Toonies to give her!"}
{"text":"Wow service was amazing, everyone was attentive and super nice! Food came out quickly. The Mark burger (thanksgiving burger) was awesome! Shoe string onion rings and sweet potato tots wow yummy highly recommend. Very impressed by the cocktail menu at a burger place. It was hard to find a good margarita in vegas of all places and they had an Agave margarita and it was delicious! I'm from San Diego California and we need a Wahlburgers over here please!!!"}
{"text":"So they opened up a mediocre burger joint. One might say I had high expectations, but if you've watched the show you'll see why I expected so much more. I had the signature \"Our Burger\" cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, dill pickles and special Wahl sauce. The meat was OK I was hoping for a juicier beef patty, and the bun could be better. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad burge it's just average. I could name other local burger joints that make my mouth water. I do like this restaurant/bar concept good for groups."}
{"text":"Food: We ordered \"Our Burger\" we modified it to our liking for toppings and the wahl sauce was amazing! We both ordered chocolate frappes they were rich but very good! 

Service: When we first arrived, it was about a 30 minute wait to be seated, they were asking for phone numbers so that they could text you when your table was ready. We haven't been able to receive texts while I'm Canada so the hostess advised that it was no problem as long as we were staying close she would come find us.  About 30-35 minutes later we were seated, they gave us 2 options for seating because of my husbands wheelchair. We chose option 2 it was near the window and was much more accessible. When our server came the great service continued. She was kind, quick, and familiar with everything. 

Only one disappointment with this was that we wanted a shot glass a momento and the mgr advised that they've not had them since December. Time to take them off the board I think!"}
{"text":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!! I'm so sad. I wanted to love this place. My husband and I have been waiting to come here ever since they opened and we were finally in Vegas at that time. Rude snippy waitress, it felt like they were pushing us out as fast as they could. The food was blah, nothing great and was so expensive. Will not be back"}
{"text":"I usually don't like celebrity restaurants, they are only alive because of the name. I came in here expecting to be disappointed and prove my point. I was wrong.
Service was great. Our server was Dakota and he was very attentive and at least 4 other employees stopped by to check on us.
The burgers are good, not excellent, but good. Hence the 4 stars not 5. Keep reading.
Onion Rings are different. They are onion straws, but that is not the different part. They use Red Onion. 
This is the first place I've been to that uses the Red Onion. It's not just for salads and slaws. Nice flavor."}
{"text":"Slow service. I got up and left after being ignored for twenty minutes. There's plenty of places to eat on The Strip. I understand being busy but that's not the same as ignoring customers. At least put a glass of water in front of a guest and make them welcome."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to check out the Wahlberg family restaurant this time in Vegas we tried Wahlburgers. 

The restaurant is interesting, patio, bar and take-out orchestrated in a strip mall/ plaza.

The staff was engaging and helpful, all seemed to work together.

My sister had macaroni & cheese that was ok but she would not re-order.

My husband had a Turkey burger with onion straws that he enjoyed.  I had a turkey cheeseburger and tater tots.  The burger was good but the tots were not hot and ruined my nostalgic moment.  I found it pricey 2 Turkey burgers and 2 tater tots $34.53 

Plenty of room to sit and enjoy your meal.

The logo and family story are sweet.

Worth a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Wahlburgers for the first time yesterday despite the less-than-stellar reviews. Being a Wednesday around 5:00 with no tribe game or other events going on, we had no wait! Hooray!  We were greeted promptly and cheerfully by the hostess and took a couple seats at the nearly empty bar. (There were plenty of empty tables too, but we just prefer bar seating.) The bartender was friendly and brought our drinks promptly. We ordered the \"OFD\" Burger, sweet potato tots, and Mac & Cheese with bacon. Our meal was delivered quickly!  And everything looked awesome! Bonus! Unfortunately everything we ordered tasted AWFUL! The burger was incredibly bland. The bun was mushy. The mac & cheese had NO FLAVOR! None! I very rarely add salt & pepper to my meals while dining out but this got a serious dose of both. And it didn't help. Even the bacon didn't save it. Also, it was strangely thin and watery. I could've used a spoon instead of a fork. The sweet potato tots were ridiculously sweet. And mushy. They almost fell apart in my fingers when I picked them up. Ugh. Both the Mac & Cheese and the tots were left half uneaten. (And my husband always finishes EVERYTHING!) So to wrap it up... we had fantastic service! The staff is the only reason they get two stars from me instead of one. But fantastic service alone isn't enough to bring me back there. Seriously, there are so many better places to dine in that area."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting in Las Vegas and heard that Wahlburgers had just opened recently. Knowing that we are fans of the Wahlberg family we thought we would give their location a try. I have to honestly say that the burgers were just plain average, nothing really to write home about, but the fries were cold as hell. The shock came when we got the bill, $49.85 for 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 fountain drinks. We were in utter amazement. We would have rather gone down the road and picked up Burger King, McDonalds or Carls Jr. instead as the taste of those burgers are far better IMO. For the amount of food, quality and price, this was simply highway robbery! Needless to say we will not be returning..."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I'm a fan of the show! It did not disappoint great burger and the onion rings were delicious ... worth the visit"}
{"text":"We expected it to be pricey and basic since this place is really only here because of its namesake.  But... how does a burger place serve red/bloody \"medium\" burger patties?  I feel like they'd be more likely to cook a hockey puck before serving a moo'ing cow to someone who asks for MEDIUM haha

I guess we also should have expected the bartender to take 30 minutes to bring us our check because he was trying to get a female customer's phone number...

BUT after our burgers were fixed, they did taste good!!!  Hallelujah!!!

(More than $15 for one burger, just a burger, no fries, no pedicure, no tickets to blue man group.... again, expected, but just a LOT$$$)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a yummy burger and fantastic customer service. I like my burgers on the plain side, flavorable, but not so juicy that the bun is wet. Their burger was perfect for me and Paul's sauce is super. My friend had the turkey burger and she said it was the best. The shakes and specialty cocktails were good too. The best part - the customer service! Our waitress, Alexandria H. was awesome. She visited with us, was attentive but not intrusive. We will definitely return to this burger place on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Portions are very small, food resembles public school cafeteria I expected more from Donnie mark alma and...Paul  tonight I am going home to binge watch blue bloods in disappointment"}
{"text":"Great, fun atmosphere! The Mac & Cheese with smoked bacon was AMAZING! May be one of the best Mac & Cheeses I've had! Great job, Wahlburg family! Next time I'll have to try the burgers if this is how good the Mac & Cheese is!"}
{"text":"We've been there twice and we love the burgers!!!  Definitely in my top 2 now.  Our kids love their chicken nuggets and Mac&cheese too. Great staff are a plus-plus!!!"}
{"text":"So I have been here twice, actually three times and I havent been disappointed yet, I have actually sat at the bar which is not to bad really, they get your order rather quickly and are attentive to your needs. I haven't sat in the main dining area, but every-time I have gone here its been packed with people grant this is one on the strip but its worth trying out I had the Wahlburger and they have sweet potatoes tater tots those are the greatest and you need to try their house wahl sauce it goes great with their burger and tots! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good burger place to try and the prices are not that bad really they are reasonable for being on the strip, the employees are also friendly and help you by giving you good recommendations."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm this was awesome!!!! I'm a big fan of the Wahlburgs and couldn't wait to try it! It was so yummy! Sloppy Joes was good and tater tots were awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing from beginning to end!! The hostess was friendly and we were sat within the time period she quoted us.. (that's pretty rare!).. the food came out promptly even though it was busy which is incredible!! I've never had a turkey party before but I figured go for it! I had the \"thanksgiving burger\" which is Mark's favorite by the way.. I could NOT PUT IT DOWN! Turkey patty with stuffing, orange cranberry sauce, mayo and butternut squash!! I WAS IN HEAVEN!!! I highly recommend this place if you ever visit, it's a MUST while in Vegas!!! If I could do 10 stars it wouldn't be enough!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, chicken burger was really good. All the sides and sauce was good. Burger was 4 out of 5. Great service, would go again if I visit Cleveland again"}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant with a famous family attached to it. That being said I still
Went back n to see what all the hub bub was about. I was there in December and had the 'tis the season burger.  I never would
Have put those flavors together. It they work!  I could doing without all the grizzled onions. It makes the sandwich to greasy if they sit in the warming bin too long.  I ordered the Mac and cheese. Sent it back. I get that they had no money growing up but stop with the govt cheese items. I ordered the tester tots.  I mean they were tster tots. Would I go back. Yeah I guess if someone wanted to go and we were near them and they were still serving the ''tis the season or something's  unique like it."}
{"text":"Been wanting to this place for a while, I was not disappointed. Ordered the surf and turf burger which has bacon and lobster and was very satisfied."}
{"text":"While in vegas we decided to see what it is all about.
Wife heard about the incredible burger and I had the bacon cheeseburger. 
The incredible burger is not on the menu yet but on the napkin holder. 

We also split the onion rings and bacon Mac and cheese.

We were stuffed and left plenty behind.
The incredible burger I had a bite of and it has a unique and good flavor. Bacon cheeseburger was predictable.

Found out when the check came the incredible burger was $18.95...

It was an experience and vacation so what the heck.

Would we recommend it to others sure. Would we do it again likely but only split 1 side."}
{"text":"Had a flight delay, went into Wahlburgers, honestly, worst rip off - had a club sandwich, bun was wet soggy, had a side salad, 3 ozs of greens,  Stay away from this rip off. However their is really no decent food in International in T 1.  How do they let this place stay open ripping people off, If people were not trapped for food and located outside the airport would never survive selling garbage like this."}
{"text":"Yaldale , I wish I spelled her name right .
Amazing service friendly I have no words to describe how she attended to every request we asked for .
Will definitely recommend the food was amazing but she made my burger experience A FIVE STAR."}
{"text":"Great burgers. You have to stop here if you eat meat. I have been to the Wahlburgers on the east coast as well and they are both delicious."}
{"text":"Good burger.  I had the BBQ bacon burger very tasty.  Our waiter Victor quick friendly service.  Just opened so expect a little wait if you have more than 4 people.  Burger is more than enough so skip the fries."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the show. This was a must try kinda place. I love how when it's crowded they offer to text you when it's your turn. They also have a photographer that takes photos of you. With the option to buy them if you want too. My first time there and it was a great place to try on vacation."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is energetic, family, a fun, a good social place for friends & Family. The bar area is really nice, plenty of drinks available. The restaurant is very clean, staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The food is very well priced, the food is unbelievable, probably the best Burger I have had in a long time. They also provide the option for people who are healthy eaters to get any sandwich or burger with no bun. Great place, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Mediocre burger and the fries were served lukewarm. Not what I'd expect at $15 +tax/tip per plate but at the very least they could have had the Jays game on the tele. Golf plus domestic soccer on instead of a Jays home game at the bottom of the eight @ 8-8 vs the Sox is borderline unforgivable for a place called Toronto Pearson Airport. For shame. If I hadn't said something we would have missed 2 amazing plays and a 10-9 win! The burger was Meh and the fries sucked plus the game came on wayyyy to late. I'll stay near Starbucks next time at least the breakfast place had the game on..."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The burgers were really good. Not too huge that you felt full afterwards, but not tiny either. I had Mark's favorite and it was really good. I would love to try the others on their menu. The fries were a sharable size. I would go here again. I love that they stay open pretty late, and they have great cocktails to enjoy as well."}
{"text":"Super-friendly service, cool decor, great lemonade, AMAZING  burger and descent prices! Located in the heart of the strip and quick service. 

I don't even like turkey burgers but this Thanksgiving burger they have, has an amazing taste!"}
{"text":"The service was the fastest I've ever had at a restaurant. We came here because we heard about the family name, and I'm glad we came in! Late lunch, got the Melt and a side of onion rings. A lot of food! For just being open for two days, I think the service has been great. Keep up the good work! Open atmosphere, casual and a little loud, but a great location on the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Great burger even better onion rings. Well priced. Good value. Service was good as well!"}
{"text":"Burger was very good. Had a BBQ bacon burger. Even the bread was good. Super tasty.
I'll pass on the chili fries though. Chili is pretty dry.
The service here is great. Very friendly and helpful staff.

They really got to get rid of the trying to get you to buy the picture they take of u. Almost shoved the picture down my throat"}
{"text":"Fiancee doesn't like Mark Wahlburg, so I may get in trouble for having eaten here, but the rest of my coworkers wanted to try it. 

We were on our way to a Blue Jays game, so we decided to get the 'to-go/self-serve\" burgers, i.e. we ordered in the back, got our food and took it to the tables they had set up upstairs. We were all a bit shocked by the price of the food. The burgers were quite pricey for what they were and they didn't even include a side. 

I ordered a kids cheese burger with all the toppings and a side of sweet potato tots. I have to say that it was honestly filling for me, but for how much the boys paid vs what they got, quite underwhelming. $10+ for just the burger and then extra for fries... 

In terms of the actual food, it was tasty, the burger was cooked well and the tots were nice and crispy, yet squishy on the inside... the way tots are made to be. 

There was tons of Wahlberg things on the wall and the top 10 movie clips or something playing above the bar. 

Not bad, but definitely a touristy place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  I love the show and have been super excited for the brothers and their success of taking Wahlburgers worldwide but sometimes you have to make sure you don't stretch yourself thin.  We were there to celebrate our friends wedding and chose Wahlburgers as the place to eat the night before.  We were crammed into a table against the wall and everyone was a bit uncomfortable.  The server was nice but I do not believe he got a single order correct.  Burgers weren't cooked correctly, some people got things on their burger they didn't order and some items were simply left off.  My biggest pet peeve was they \"sold\" the meals when they brought them to the table.  They yelled \"who had the _____\" which left us looking at each other because several of us ordered the same thing.  If it's done properly the server should ring the order in by seat and the food runner should put the food on the tray in the order of the seats therefore eliminating confusion.  My other issue was the price... holy lord.  $13 for JUST THE BURGER??? I had to check to see if I was eating at a Michelin Star Chef's restaurant with that price!  Sides were extra.  We ordered a side of onion rings and they came out ice cold.  I asked for a new order and the server seemed very annoyed that cold onion rings were served.  Since we were there to celebrate the whole mood was brought down with lackluster service and sub par food.  There are thousands of places to eat in Vegas and I'm sure our next visit we will avoid this place."}
{"text":"Paul's burger is great and the sweet potato fries were awesome. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Meh.  I wish my food could've been as swole as Mark.  Never seen the show.  Didn't even know there was a show.  There was nothing gourmet about this establishment.  Apparently the Wahlberg name justifies a price at least two times greater than quality demands.  I didn't expect a Kobe patty dusted with gold flakes, but I was hoping for something a little more than what I was served.  Blah flavor.  Blah toppings.  The best part of the menu was the FluffahNuttah adult shake.  Next time, I'll just order that as my meal.  The plus side - service was wonderful from initial greetings to final payout and departure.  Friendly, prompt, and attentive.  Step it up, Wahlbergs.  This food needs some serious attention to flavor, quality, and quantity that matches the price point."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to a Wahlburgers and have been talking about coming here for some time. I have been by the one in Michigan as well but have never had the opportunity to stop in. My son has been here one time before and said it was ok. 
Gotta tell you we are very disappointed, my wife and I had their house burger and it was awful... my son had something different and it was just a bit better. I can truthfully say we will never be back again... there are allot of better hamburger places around. Had to try it just to say we did!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location three times since it has open and the food and service are terrific!  If you are hungry go with the Triple Decker or the Melt.  Very tasty!!!  The onion rings (made with slivers of Red onion) are addictive and very good.  Try the Frappes (a milk shake kind of thing) - my favorite is the Creamsickle - tastes just like the frozen treat on a stick the you would get as a kid!!

Service has been excellent every time i have gone.  These servers really seem to care about getting you good food out to you fast.  I never waited for a thing.

Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and service I received.  Definitely will be back many, many time!!"}
{"text":"You can skip the wait time by sitting at the bar, faster service anyways because you have the bartender in front of you taking your orders.
The burgers were good.
The locations by the strip so its packed, but we conveniently were able to grab a quick bite before our show. 
Its a bit overpriced however, then again everything in Vegas is overpriced"}
{"text":"I was staying at Bally's last week and was excited that there was a Wahlburgers. Seated outside on a beautiful night and was ready for a good meal. The waitress was great and everyone around me was in a great mood. Then the food came. I ordered my hamburger medium. When it and the fries came they were cold. I was told that when you order medium it isn't cooked as long and therefore not hot.  Never heard that or had it happen before. Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Heard they are open so family went on 12-29-17. The people at hostess table seemed to be overwhelmed. Our waiter was awesome very friendly and helped us decide on what to get..the onion rings are delicious by far the best onion rings. The sweet potato tots are good, I would have liked them crisper.  That tomato jam omg awesome. My picky husband thought it was going to be like McDonald's...Lol he loved his O.F.D and said he will definitely eat there again of course I expected everything to be perfect and it was... I left with a full belly and a bag with a shirt, sweat shirt and beer glass."}
{"text":"This has to be the best burger I have ever eaten. I got the Walburger nothing special just pickle, onions and Walburg sauce. It was cooked perfect hot and juicy. My wife had the portabelo salad awesome. Will be are go to place when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I had probably unrealistic hopes for this place, like thought it was going to be the best burger I ever had. The food was good though nothing spectacular. The oil that they use to fry their foods left a weird after taste in my mouth, almost like it had gone a tad rancid which I wasn't a fan of.
Service was good though! We put our name in on no wait but still had a decent wait, and they gave us free French fries (that we definitely didn't ask for) to hold our kids over."}
{"text":"I'm writing this with a heavy heart. I'm a fan of the Wahlburgers show and for the longest time I hoped they would open a store close to SoCal. Finally I thought my dreams came true when the one in Las Vegas opened off the strip. I recently took a trip this past weekend, I told my fiancé the ONLY thing I wanted to do was have a creation built by Paul. So Saturday night after a long day of gambling we finally built up an appetite to grab some grub. I checked the hours, they close at 4:00 it was 1:30. Perfect!!! I finally can have my chance to stuff my face with burgers and fries. This was also the last weekend I gave myself to pig out before I began dieting for my wedding. So for sure I was ready to go all in with the BIGGEST juiciest burger they had.... here's where my story gets ugly, we show up I notice the chairs upside down on the tables outside. My heart sinks. There's ppl inside eating, someone even ordering at the chadors inside but all the doors were locked. I wanted to cry. Desperate and about to cry I walk away and remember they have a pop up closer to the sidewalk. I get there, it's just merch but when I ask those employees when the restaurant closes they said they were still suppose to be open?! I explain what happened even they were in disbelief and one guy walks over to the restaurant to check it out for us. Sure enough, closed. I wish I could give 5 stars, I wish I could write this review about a poor hamburger experience but I didn't even have a chance to taste one ): I'm just disappointed. I'm a fan of this family of their show and I wanted to say their good but I was let down. Please don't advertise on your website that you're open later than you are. I mean it's Las Vegas you should be open later than 1:30?!!??? That's still a half hour left to buy alcohol in California. I just don't get it ):"}
{"text":"The food was excellent!!  Burgers were so awesome!  Onion rings are amazing!!  Our server Ashley was great!!"}
{"text":"Excited to visit . Nice decor and view out the big windows. Burger was average at best , the cup of 15 small tater tots was small and lukewarm. Yellow gold fries were much better. A chicken Cobb salad was alright but again small and lacking much in toppings. A salad made from any burger is just what it means, they take plain lettuce and put the burger meat right in top of the plain lettuce. Letdown if you just get a burger with cheese sitting in a bowl of lettuce only. Glad I tried it but next time I'll go to 5 guys or even hello bistro for a burger."}
{"text":"First time here let's see how good the hamburgers are .....Well I got my food it took 45 min to get our food,order my burgers were to de medium done and they came out raw .The wait was to long for a re-fire so we decided to eat around the burger not the middle of it.We are very disappointed since we are number one fans of the show.Overall I give u one start because the margaritas were good.
  We would  like to receive a response to our yelp and maybe we can resolve our next visit to a pleasant wont."}
{"text":"The buns were extremely soggy and the sweet potato fries were too sweet. The onion rings were too salty; we were done after a few bites. The service was mediocre and other sides were just okay. I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"The sweet potato tots are delicious! I had the sloppy joe and it was amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, not only for the food but the experience as well! The service was great!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town.  Savory, delicious and juicy.  The sauce !!!!
Had the triple decker (bbq bacon style)
Fish sandwich ....best in class
Onion rings (straws)

Long wait.   Staff don't drop extra partties to anticipate big lines.  They are in a zone.  

$$ on burger price.   Addons like fries, onion straws (delicious) $3.50."}
{"text":"The burger was okay. It tasted like the beef was frozen not fresh. The house sauce was okay not much taste. The tatertots were soggy not crispy. The hostess insisted I sit in bar since I was party of 1. I told her no a couple of times. The place was almost empty. Big hype because of famous brothers."}
{"text":"After finishing a work project at Bally's, I decided to take the team of guys I  was working with to Wahlburgers for a late lunch. We arrived at the restaurant around 2:30p, and we were immediately seated. Our waiter quickly took drink orders while we took a look at the menu. 

I ordered \"The Our Burger\" which is a 1/3lb burger, lettuce, tomato, cheese and the signature Whal sauce, and our group was up for us to order all the sides and share so that we could try all of them. So we ordered the crispy yukon french fries, thin crispy onion rings, tater tots and the sweet potato tater tots. I then finished my order with a housemade vanilla frappe. 

With all of the hype surrounding the \"Whalburgers\" restaurant, I have to admit that I was expecting to be a bit underwhelmed with the food. Needless to say... I was pleasantly proven wrong! My burger was excellent, the bun was super soft and the burger was cooked perfect and served hot. For the side dishes I would have to say my favorite was the tater tots and my least favorite was the thin crispy onion rings (they more so seemed like they should be in the burger rather that a side). And my housemade frappe was sooooo yummy! Must have!

The atmosphere at Whalburgers was really fun and I really enjoyed the food. Looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"Literally. I am so sad to write this review. I really wanted to love this place as much as I love the Wahlbergs and man did this place disappoint.

I was super sad. SUPER sad walking out of this place. Not just one thing happened but multiple! And I can't even comprehend how one thing just came after another. 

Babe knew I really wanted to come eat here so he drove out of his way AND we paid $7 to park at the Bally's parking garage. It's a little bit of a walk to get to the actual restaurant. Upon arriving it looked pretty busy and I was so happy and excited to eat knowing it was an actual sit down restaurant with servers. I thought it was going to be something like a you order and sit down so I was wrong... and got giddy. There were a few spots open but looked like two parties ahead of us. Host thought we were party for \"Harris\" but nope we just wanted to put our name down. She said it'd be a 15 minute wait so she took our number and said they'd text us when it's ready. 

We walked around the area as there are shops and bars nearby, however everything was closed at that time so we just walked and took pictures. They were pretty on point with timing. Sent us a text and even called my phone. When we were entering there was a party of three guys who were arguing with the lady asking her why they couldn't sit down in the booth to the left.. I was thinking in my head, if she lets them sit down before us and that's our table I would be so mad. She let them sit down and I was like hmmmm. She took us to a table. Ugh, that booth probably would have been for us. But I'm not picky so we just sat down.

The interior is pretty nice. Green, black, and silver is the theme. Wahlbergs everywhere. Movies and pictures. Pretty cool. Service was eh though.

I'm not mean so I'm not gonna put her name in here even though I know it... but she took our orders, and as for specific happenings... I asked for the sweet potato tots to be extra crispy because I know that sweet potatoes are never crispy when they are fried wherever you order them, and she said \"oh they're pretty crispy.\" So what do we do? Trust her. My friend asked for some sauces on the side. What do we do? Hope she brings them to us.

Our food came out in a decent manner. But the tots -- not crispy. And the sauce -- nowhere to be found. My friend asked the food runner for bbq and ranch and he brought a bunch! Thanks man! Once we started eating our server comes by out of nowhere and put my friend on blast saying  \"oh you coulda told me about your sauces why didn't you ask me\" and we were like... uhhhhhhhhhh (it was awkward the way she said it...) she did ask you.... *cricket* *cricket* Much awkwardness...

The awkwardness didn't help the fact that the food wasn't that great. And her vibe not great either. We paid for the check and she grabbed the check while we were still eating... didn't want to wait til we left to see your tip?

Anyway, food was nothing special. Service, or lack thereof, was nothing special. Maybe if the Wahlbergs show up then it'll be special. I am so disappointed!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Wahlburgers for lunch on a sunday afternoon just after it opened for the soft opening but before the grand opening.  The staff were young and friendly and efficient.  The atmosphere is a family sports bar.  The burgers were fresh, simple but full of flavour.  I had the tater tots instead of fries.  They were good but a side sauce would have made them better.  Overall a nice place to grab a burger with friends."}
{"text":"Awful.  Was so looking forward to this experience and left unimpressed. The service was slow and the waitress had no desire to be there.  When we finally got our food things were mixed up and super cold, so we ended up sending half of it back. 

Also no one who worked there had ever met any of the Wahlburgers so it's not the 'family experience' I had imagined. I'll stick to the TV show but my hope is shattered."}
{"text":"We had great service the food was delicious. I got the fiesta burger with taters tots on the side they were fantastic!!! My sister got the sweet potato tots they were my favorite!! And we got a Wahlburgers cup!! Lol. #TeamGordis"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my girlfriend today.. 
I wasn't expecting it to be so good 

There was a guy outside named Jones, who invited us in with a $5 coupon 

I ordered the Mark Wahlberg favourite
It was the Thanksgiving bun with turkey and stuffing and cranberry. 

My friend had the salad with sliced burger on it. 
I ordered tater tots
The food was surprisingly very good. 
I was talking about it all day! 

I'll be back. This week"}
{"text":"First time here. We came just because I'm a huge fan of the show. We barely waited for a table which was great. They accommodated my father who is in a wheel chair. Loved that! Everyone was friendly and helpful. Wee asked what they liked best to help us make our decision. It's weird getting a new paper cup for every drink but I know Paul made that decision from watching the show. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had to wait about five minutes to be seated, despite the fact the place wasn't busy. Our chicken burgers were tasty and well cooked, as was my daughter's order of chicken fingers and fries. Meal was delivered on time as was the bill. Wish we had fries with our burgers but OK overall we are happy with our meal here."}
{"text":"Sorry I tried to put half star . Fucken Marky Mark I swore after pain and gain he was never gonna rip me off again . But congratulations Marky Mark you got me Wahlburgers was a joke in Vegas . Expected the prices because we live here but we never expected every item we ordered to be cold my brothers and I watch the show and have been waiting for wahlburgers to open forever. This was not the right stuff ."}
{"text":"The standard burger, \"our burger\" is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten; the wahlsauce is to die for!
I've gone on two occasions and both times I've had mediocre service, not terrible but nothing that stands out as amazing. The caesar salad is a little bland, and I'm not a fan of the garlic salt on the fries, but the actual burger made it worth it for me.
I'm eager to go back and try the tater tots, as well as the sweet tater tots."}
{"text":"The location is a bit disappointing. Our waiter was really nice and engaging. I had the burger salad. It was good, but nothing to write home about.  We did ask the bartender to change the TV to the MMA fights and he turned it right away.  I would go back because of a chance run in with \"Marky Mark\""}
{"text":"The wait to get in was not too long we only waited 2 minutes to get a seat but took awhile  for the food to get served. Other than that it was great food good music and energetic vibes!"}
{"text":"I debated on whether or not it would be worth my time to write a review or not. And I came to the conclusion that I should. Why? Because good people will spend a good amount of money at this location and I want people to know what they are paying for.

We waited about 20 minutes to get seated. Which wasn't bad. Once we were seated it took about 15 minutes for a server to even come by. She took our drink order then disappeared. She finally came back after another 15 minutes with our drinks. At that point I made sure she took our order. My husband ordered the Bbq bacon burger w/ tater tots and I ordered The Melt w/ Sweet Potato tater tots.
40 minutes later our food came. (Mind you, at this point we have spent over an hour there)

My food was cold. It wasn't even close to being warm. My husband's was luke warm. I didn't bother to complain because the waitress was too busy talking to another server about her evening. I just asked for the check. We paid about $54.00 for two people. Didn't bother leaving a tip.

Because of the show, I know people will continue to go. And our reviews don't mean anything to them. Which is sad."}
{"text":"Famous restaurant... typical high prices food is pretty average but your on the Vegas strip so it's common... very fast paced restaurant and and I felt I was being rushed by waitress"}
{"text":"VERY good burger! We ordered the \"Our Burger\" and it did not disappoint! Well seasoned and perfect amount of food. 

Service was friendly and fast.  I also saw them keeping the place clean and cleaning as they worked. That's important to me."}
{"text":"Best burger ever. Easley followed by the best server ever, Jill. Thanks for being such a pleasant person, wish all servers could be as nice as you"}
{"text":"Made sure to stop by this place while visiting Las Vegas.  Took a while to get our order, but the food was fantastic.  We all shared a hamburger, the open-faced meatloaf, tots and a vanilla shake.  The burger was perfectly cooked and juicy and the bread was great!  The meatloaf was huge and can easily be shared.  Wish they'd open one in Arizona."}
{"text":"My goodness either I was dog hungry or this pace is amazing!! When I walked in I thought this was a order and sit spot. But it's an actual restaurant where they serve you. The service was magnificent, and the food even better. There are pictures of the Wahlburgs all over this place that was great to see. This will def be a regular spot for me as I visit Vegas hands down. The location was great too."}
{"text":"Brittany was great! Made the Las Vegas experience so wonderful! Our ladies group enjoyed visiting with her while waiting for our table."}
{"text":"I had the portobello mushroom sandwich and it was absolutely delicious!! My fiancé had a burger and he said it was like any other burger. We shared onion rings, which were really good too. The Wahlburger sauce is delicious. One of the best pina colada's I've ever had! Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Can we change the name to Coldburgers?  My party ordered two burgers.  Both were cold.  Not even warm.  I touched the patty and felt no warmth.  Both burgers were less than half eaten.  

This is the first time that I've eaten at Iceburgers.  I'm a big burger fan.  I love good burgers.  Sadly, the quality of the food matches the quality of Mark's movies.  Less than mediocre.

They offered to cook up new burgers.  Too late.  You only have one change to make a first impression.  I lost confidence and didn't want to waste more time.  I was offered half off the bill and I accepted but a discount wasn't the goal.  I left feeling hungry and ripped-off by Fakeburger.

Las Vegas is a world class destination.  It's surrounded by the Bellagio, Ceasar's Palace, the Flamingo, and Planet Hollywood.  We're not talking some trailer park outpost in the middle of the desert.  And yet they want customers to leave their taste buds at the door when entering.

Should have gone to Walgreens and bought a packaged sandwich from their fridge.  That would have been warmer.  

Never again.  

One and done.  

Wanna-be-burger."}
{"text":"I have watched Wahlburgers, the TV show in the first season and so when I was looking for a lunch spot and saw that it was close by, I decided to check it out. 

The venue is in what appears to be a new, upcoming location for dining and shopping - The Block. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor and is large, open, and airy. The color scheme is green and Black. 

They had just opened for lunch and I was greeted and seated very quickly. My waitress, Christine, was extremely friendly and pleasant. She asked if I'd been here before and when I told her that I had not, she proceeded to go through the menu with me and explained the quality and type of meat used in the burgers. She then took my drink order while I made up my mind.q

I decided to try the sloppy joe. I'm sorry that I didn't try the Wahlburgers. It's not that the Sloppy Joe was bad, it just did not suit my taste. I think it might have been the addition of the cheese sauce and the Wahl sauce that was a bit off putting. I also prefer my Sloppy Joe on a bun instead of a slice of bread - but that's just me. The Thin Crispy Onion Rings were just that! They were hot and full of flavor, however, the house made pickles were a bit sharp tasting for me and I did not enjoy them. Beneath all of the stuff on top of the Sloppy Joe, the quality of the meat was excellent. Next time, I'll try their burger. 

I don't know about the other servers, but Christine was great. She made the experience worth my trip even though I was overwhelmed with the flavor of the food."}
{"text":"So impressed. Clean, kind and happy place. Employees must be treated well. Smiles all around. Not to mention, best gluten free burger bun I've ever had. Wow. Competition for In n Out."}
{"text":"Loved the burgers. Our waitress on the other hand left much to be desired. I've worked in the food industry for years and was management at several places. I know how dealing with customers all day can be draining and you can forget things. No biggie. EXCEPT it was 3 in the afternoon and the waitress had no other tables. There were a few things I let slide. As she was leaving our table with our burger orders, she asked if we wanted any sides. I asked my husband if he wanted fries and he replied \"yes\" while nodding and looking at the waitress. I re-iterated the order and said, \"Fries please.\" She said okay and walked away. Burgers came. No fries. I just assumed she forgot. When she came back around after we completely finished our burgers and wanted to know if we wanted anything else. My husband said, \"oh... I believe we had also ordered some fries as well.\" Totally nice tone, as always. She looks at him and said in a super-snotty tone, \"uh, no you didn't.\"  I believe she saw the shock on our faces and then asked if we wanted to place an order for fries. No, no we didn't. That moment passed when she was rude."}
{"text":"Well worth it! Just sad that my family wasn't able to to meet   the Wahlburgers. So whenever the Wahlburgers want a good meal in return my door is open ."}
{"text":"I had the OFD burger and it was AMAZING!! I ask for a gluten free bun, it was absolutely delicious! The flavor of the meat was different from your average burger, so good. The burger was juicy, the sauce was also great-- all the components of this OFD burger-- Swiss cheese, mushrooms went very well together. I also ordered the tots-- two thumbs up!! Kudos to Mr. Paul Wahlberg."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, I would. The hostess was not only rude to our party but as well lied to our faces and to her boss. She told us 30-40 min wait. We waited more than an hour. 

I WOULD NOT GO BACK AGAIN AND TELLING EVERYONE I KNOW ABOUT MY POOR EXPERIENCE.

The rude hostess at the front had blond-ish short wavy hair. 
They told us her name was TONI.
I have her picture posted in the pictures section in case they were lying to us about the rude waitress' name.

Two parties were seated before us (party of 7 and party of 9). She told us the tables outside were for our party. And then she gave it away to a party of 9. On top of that, she told us we were next to be seated when she gave away the other party after us our seats. Talk about terrible service to begin with. 

I would like to think if a hostess messes up and then lies to customers and her boss with differing explanations of what she told us versus what she told her boss she would apologize. But she didn't  apologize and just shook her head at us while staring us down. 

We came in on Sunday, December 4th at 1:39pm

Our dining experience:
One person in our party ordered the OFD. They gave him the bacon BBQ burger saying it was the OFD even though we asked to make sure it was the OFD. We sent it back. They gave us a 2nd burger telling us it was fixed and it was the OFD for sure. They gave us the wrong order with the BBQ bacon burger AGAIN. So by the time he got his THIRD burger our party was already done eating. 

Because of the problem with the hostess earlier,  what looked like person in charge told us he would take care of us because of it and do something to make up for it. They didn't really do anything to make up for it. Initially we were offered no comp or discount until we had to ask. In which case, by that time we were just over eating here. 

The food here was pretty good. However, for the hassle we went through and the poor service that was provided, that's what makes up the bulk of my review."}
{"text":"Run from this place... It is a mess!!!  It took us an hour & a half to get our food!!!  From the gatekeeper at the front who can't seem to seat people at tables that are empty once cleaned to the waitstaff who can't get orders right or even ask how you want your burger cooked to the cooks who can't cook a burger right (almost so raw it can't even be called rare when they never asked how you want your burger!!!). There for the soft opening after waiting more than a year and all I can say is that it's not worth returning without a major change... Or closing the doors forever. 

This place makes a Chinese fire drill look like a choreographed ballet!!!  Perhaps this place needs to be closed and a Mickey D's put in its place... They at least have their act together!!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are not cooked. If you eat here make sure to tell them to cook your burger. You would expect a burger place to ASK you how you would want your burger cooked when you order, but not this place. So when your burger arrives at your table completely pink and you ask to have it cooked longer, they tell you that you MUST wait for all the orders before yours now (why can't they just throw it on the huge grill???)!!! Oh and by the way, pink all the way through in their book is medium.....no it's NOT, that is medium RARE!"}
