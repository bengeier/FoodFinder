{"text":"Really great food and super nice staff!  Love the grocery and how fresh and delicious every dish is, yummy desserts too!!!  Plus, they cater to Atkins and healthy dishes too!"}
{"text":"So.... having lived in Scottsdale for several years (back then), when I came back five  + years later, Guido's was on my list of places to visit while here....  The food is exactly as I remember!  My favorite is the Chicago Style Combo, which is absolutely phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, very slow...
Food was tasteless, how can you ruin a Shrimp Parm hero ???
This is why New York is so much better than Chicago style..
Would not recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of this place, I go often, and not only do I love the food but I HIGHLY recommend others to go there.  I don't want to write a big, long boring play by play...  But here is what I CAN tell you:

The owner is from Chicago (Hence the name!)
He is ALWAYS there, and greets everyone and is super nice.  Every single thing I have ever ordered there is DELISH.  I have not had a single complaint, or been disappointed even once.  Their sandwiches, particularly the eggplant parm and the chicken parm are incredible.  Amazing crusty bread with a huge portion, they don't skimp.  Their sauce is outstanding as well. The meatballs are phenomenal. I am also a fan of their minestrone soup.  I have gone there just for that.  its hearty, needs absolutely nothing sprinkled on or added to it.  And they are consistent.  Always good, every time.

I am actually salivating as I type this review LOL.  Seriously though, if you haven't tried it, please go.  It's a casual, friendly environment, and the food is outstanding, I don't care who you are, Italian or not.  (Although, it IS an Italian import store as well and their cheeses and bread are amaze balls!)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best broasted chicken in Phoenix.

5 star service and quality of food
Cooked to order
Tasty, not greasy chicken, very moist
4 piece meal will fill up the hungriest man
Comes with nice dinner salad

My new go to place for chicken in town. Thanks"}
{"text":"Had the Italian Sub VERY GOOD! The service was great very friendly and my sandwich came out quickly.  Would vista again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Breasted chicken....fried shrimp.....cole slaw....lasagne.
And they deliver!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian Deli in Scottsdale! Such a great place. Good Italian Groceries and even better made to order food. Italian Sandwiches are great!! So fresh!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food, friendly service, a bit expensive but fresh food, lots of variety, and I'd recommend  it!!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food. I never need a menu because I always order chicken parmigiana. Tonight, I ordered the broasted chicken because my friends from Chicago were raving about it. I'm from New York, we had rotisserie chicken, fried chicken or barbecued chicken, I had never heard of broasted chicken. It was AWESOME. I would definitely recommend it. The bonus was the broasted potatoes. I did not like the cole slaw. I tasted onions which I despise. My husband loved the slaw, he loves onions. The server was very quick to switch out the cole slaw for an onion free house salad. I would recommend this gem."}
{"text":"Amazing food the homemade sausage is so good I want to have more right now. This is a must go back to place to enjoy the rest of the menu items!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Guido's several times over the past few years and was always impressed with the food, but not so much with the service. Just recently, we visited again and we were so DISGUSTED with how bad the service was that we didn't even stay and eat this time.

For example, the waitress never came to our table initially. We had to go the front of the restaurant to try and place an order. This did not work, as we were told to go back and sit down and wait some more. I must also say that as we were waiting in line, the owner, I  presume, ignored us and spoke with some customers behind us in line, putting their orders in immediately. 

So, in the end, we waited a bit more at our table and then got up and left. Even though the service has tended to be slow and rather inattentive in the past, we have never experienced this level of rudeness before. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Legit meatball sandwhich.  Broasted Chicken moist juicy hot, just they way I like it."}
{"text":"Stopped in today while waiting for a haircut next door, WOW! 

I had noticed this place a few times before, but was never hungry or didn't have to wait for the haircut. 

This place is awesome! Reminds me of the Italian deli around the corner from my grandparents house in Pittsburgh. Fresh, Fresh, Fresh! 

Had the capicola and hard salami with provolone, sub. Bread had obviously been baked that day, and the meat/cheese was so fresh you would have thought the cows and pigs were out back! 

I will continue to get a mediocre haircut over here just to have an excuse to drive out of my way for this food!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh, sweet, sweet Guido's. 

This place rocks. Just met a friend for lunch and had the prosciutto & Provolone and some fries... I know, I know- but they are all worth it. I can't say enough about how great the food is here. I used to go way more often when I lived closer, but I still try to get back whenever I can. 

It's a nice little place with indoor and outdoor seating, not enough to be crazy, just enough to fill the place up right. They are quick enough for a business lunch and I promise if you take a client here, they will thank you and want to bring people back. 

The owner is ALWAYS there, and is always watching over the place, something I find very admirable and effective. While I was there, I watched him walking through the place straightening out, a big plus for me. 

The prices are in line with a sub shop of much lesser quality so for the same money you can get real Italian stuff :) Definitely worth stopping in if you like good food and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been coming into Guido's since the late 80's. This ain't Chi-town or NY or Philly, so get over it. It's Scottsdale and its the best Chicago/Italian deli this side of the Illinois river. I haven't found another deli this side of town that is better. 
Food is great. I've eaten everything on the menu. All fresh. Some things they make the night before but I can tell you for a fact that food does not hang around here for more than 24 hours. 
 I actually like the tuna sub. Of course, the bread makes the sammy. I always buy a loaf and some meatballs from the deli to make a pasta dinner for the family. 
I'm not going to be pretentious and make recommendations. Go for yourself and see. 
Oh, and the owner always says goodbye to me when I get up and leave. 
Yea, that's a 5 STAR act in my book. 
BADDABING!"}
{"text":"Grand children sporting events in the area took me there twice this week. Sandwiches both times were outstanding! Bread was fresh and they give you a very generous serving of meat. It has a large deli meat selection. Lots of \"regulars \" in the place of lunch."}
{"text":"BTW, later than night, both my 4 year old daughter and I got food poisoning. two days of throwing up. Nice!

Yelp, please stop allowing lies to be perpetuated. Also, have an option for NO stars and put a picture of a person barfing next to it so I could rate this place with that..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing..!! From the atmoshere to the customer service and the food speaks for itself.  I have visited twice now, in the same week, both experiences were eough for me to write this \"my first writen review, ever\".  I was simply taken by the entire experience, I recommend making Guido's Chicago Meat & Deli a must on everyone's to do list.  My first visit I enjoyed their signature sausage sub, best hot sandwhich I ever had.  My next visit, I ate the Pork Loin sandwhich (ask for it-not on menu) Just in case you're wondering, I am not related in any way to the owner or his employees.  I was working in the area last week and solicited the place.  Had to go back three times in order to get a minute of the owners undivided attention. (Keep in mind, most people see me and run in the other direction)"}
{"text":"Just the worst. Owner was ranting in the back and humiliating his staff. So nasty and so rude."}
{"text":"The Broached Chicken potato  wedges was some of the best I've ever eaten anywhere. The service was remarkable. The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"I was wandering around the shopping center at Shea and Scottsdale Road at lunch trying to decide what to eat.  I noticed a little Italian Deli, and was amazed  - it was before noon and the placed was packed.  I went in and before I looked at the menu, I wandered around looking at the diners and their plates.  The diners were very mixed - professionals,  construction workers, couples, singles, and groups. They all seemed to have something different, and they all seemed to be enjoying what they were eating.  

So I decided to give it a try.  The person who took my order spoke heavily accented Italian, but I managed to convey what I wanted, which was really simple - an Italian Sub with salami, Mortadella, Pepperoni & Provolone.  It was packed with onions, tomatoes, and lettuce, and drenched in sub oil.  It was great, delicious - made me aware of what I had been missing all my life - and more than filled me up.

My only disappointment was that I was full - I wanted to try everything on their menu, because everything looked so tempting.  But they are close to my home, so I'm sure it will become my lunchtime favorite.

I only gave them 4 stars, since I only had the sandwich.  But I will update as I visit them again and try their complete menu, which also includes salads, pasta, pizza, and different kinds of subs."}
{"text":"It was the first time I tried this Italian deli.  Since it is holiday time I am always looking for an Italian store where I can buy groceries to prepare Italian meals.  I bought Pastosa frozen ravioli, sausage and cookies.  When I opened the box of ravioli many of them were cracked meaning they were old!  It was late Sunday evening the 17th of Dec.  I was disgusted but anxious to get a meal on the table.  I heard Pastosa pasta is very well respected in Brooklyn and NJ.  Having Italian roots I was excited to taste them.  Most of them opened up and the filling poured out.  We scraped up what we could.  I am a teacher and it was a busy week for me.  I finally had a chance to bring in the receipt with the box of empty ravioli.  The Asian mgr or owner came out and asked me what the date was on the receipt, how I cooked them and gave me the third degree.  All I wanted was to get another box of ravioli. She said I should have called her right away or taken a picture, therefore I get no money back and no exchange. Would I have driven all the way to Scottsdale to complain about something that didn't happen?  Fact is they were old and she didn't want to admit it.  Rude and poor customer service, I'll never set foot in that place again.  Reminds me of how they treat customers who complain in Hong Kong.  I'm going to write the pasta company to complain."}
{"text":"I'm all over this place. The Hot Chicago Roast Beef sandwich is the best in Scottsdale. Pizza is superb, Guido hails directly from the \"Windy City\". Still qualifies as \"reasonably priced\", even during our economic slow down."}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly. Delicious food. We heard of the restaurant from the show on PBS's Check Please, Arizona. We tried it and out and were not disappointed."}
{"text":"We went out to have a family dinner at guidos deli after Watching \"CHECK PLEASE\". Well we order the 2 plates broasted chicken and wedge potato and we recieced cole slaw was watery and very very sweet. we also got the pototoe salad it also was very very sweet to hard for me to each since i am diabetic .The Broasted chicken was very very dry and the pototoe wedges was very wet and soggy on the inside and fried on out side was not very good.We also had the pepproni pizza blan no taste.Husband order the caesar salad it was simple just alot lettues and some hot chicken on top and to much vinegar and water for dressing .He did not like it .We also order the gnocchi with a red sauce that was good but little blan for me.all and all I was disappointed with my order.They are very over price for the quality of food they put out .We paid $80.22 for our order last night 01/24/2017 we arrived at 9:20pm.Maybe the food is alot better early in the day I don't know .We wasted all the food it was like a taste test .We where still hungry when we left. Well I return again .I'm afraid not.My kids love to eat ... First time they did not like restaurant food.Customer service was great."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Nice and quiet. We have dined here  three times now and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout pizza.   And it was Awful.   Called to discuss.  Got a lecture.        Going to miss your broasted chicken a lot because I'm not interested in a lecture.   Way too many other choices."}
{"text":"Great! While visiting had 2 takeout meals that we really enjoyed! The atmosphere was great and could definitely  see eating at the deli as well!"}
{"text":"Guidos broasted chicken rocks as do their broasted potatoes. The Italian dishes are awesome too.
Go there,  you won't regret it. They also have a wonderful take home deli."}
{"text":"I live in Scottsdale most of the year (except summer) and this place is a favorite for the locals. They're pizza is good, fresh and made from scratch. Family-owned and operated, good service and a deli/market is also there. I buy cheeses and meats there to use at home when I cook Italian (my heritage as well). Very cozy, long-time established place. Love the cheesecake too. They also have hilarious tees you can purchase...good place to dine casually."}
{"text":"Stopped into Guido's tonight.  What a great place.  Doing the low carb thing and had meatballs and a salad.  Everything was very tasty.  I brought pasta and garlic bread home for the girls.  They liked it as well.  

I've been to Guido's many times.  It is a Chicago style Italian Deli.   I've had the Italian beef and sausage. Tastes great but is a heart  attack waiting to happen.  The Pizza is good too.

I love the grocery/deli decor.  The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Always went south of town to DeFelco's but I honestly believe this place is better. Freshest sandwich in the valley in my opinion."}
{"text":"We usually go here for great broasted chicken. My husband loves their pasta. Their sausage is homemade and delicious. Not much ambience, kinda noisy but it feels like being in New York in one if those Italian Deli markets. Great service! Always worth another visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the linguini with clam sauce per the waitress's suggestion and it was flavorless. I told her that I didn't like it and requested another item. She said that they would have to charge me for the clam linguini and the new order. I have never been to a restaurant where they charge you for something you don't like and that was also the waitress's suggestion. The customer service it terrible."}
{"text":"I just plain love Guido's. There's something almost magical about the glow of Christmas lights in the window, the arrangement of black and white memorabilia photos on the walls and the deli/market layout. My other half is from Chicago and last night he was in food heaven. He had the gnocchi and I had the mostaccioli -- yum and yum!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Reminds one of old Italian neighborhood restaurants in the 50's. Nice looking deli selection"}
{"text":"I lived in Scottsdale in 2000 and visited here often. They absolutely had the best Cracked Pepper Smoked Turkey sandwich ever. Here it is 2017 and I still rate this deli the best in Scottsdale. Unfortunately they no longer have my most favorite sandwich but you still can't go wrong with any selection.  Great Pastrami sandwich too.  If you like specialty type foods you'll love the  great Italian shopping.  

Michael Sealy"}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars the first 20 or so time i visited but it has been 4 and even 3s the past few times I went. Hope it's not a trend and they go back up to 5.

I usually order the eggplant parm either with pasta or a sandwich depending on my mood. Delicious even though lately it seems they been skimping on the cheese. Also a different bread every time so you never know which one you are getting--some breads I like better than others. I also tried the calzones, lasagna, diavalo, and the clam sauce. All delicious.


Service is usually good. Maria is one of the best waitress there and always a 5 star for service when she the waitress. Another woman with long brown hair is usually a 3 star when we get her.


I'll be back. Hope it goes back to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place for carry out. I haven't eaten in yet. Broasted chicken is great, chicken parm, conoli.  The subs have great deli meat, the bread isn't my fav. But def a go to spot."}
{"text":"I was very excited about visiting Guido's. Been looking for a good Italian sub shop that cranks out a nice chicken parm sub. I went to Guido's with my wife and four year old daughter. The atmosphere was what I expected for an Italian market. The selection of items for sale was also interesting. As you wait for your food you can peruse the market area to kill time. The service was very attentive and the waitress was sweet. My wife ordered the fried calamari and she said it was delicious. So good even my four year old ate some. My daughter had a bowl of pasta with butter and cheese. Not rocket science at all. I ordered my longtime craved chicken parm sub. I was somewhat satisfied but the sauce was a little generic and the two pieces of chicken were so small they did not even fill the bread up. I would say overall my dish was okay. I would give them a try again as the menu is varied and I would give another dish a shot. The prices seemed very fair to me. I wish I could give them four stars but just not good enough the first time around. I will keep an open mind for next time and maybe find another star. Good appetite to you all!"}
{"text":"Didn't feel like cooking Sunday night. The assembled horde were hungry. Decided to order Italian and have it delivered from Guido's. Then, later that week, we all wanted to watch the CWS-NYY game and I had a hankering for eggplant parmigiana

Sunday, we ordered a margharita pizza, sausage pizza, garlic bread w melted mozzarella and marinara and cheesecake for all. The second time, we ordered eggplant parmigiana, antipasto, fried calamari w marinara, a couple of subs and cheesecake for all.

Okay, for starters, I understand that any restaurant-delivered food is not gonna be as fresh as it would be in their dining room. That said, the food from Guido's was pretty good on that score. The delivered food was reasonably warm or reasonably cold depending on the item. The spaghetti accompanying the eggplant was al dente.

Other than the calamari -- it was over-breaded, soft and overdone -- everyone was delighted with their dinner. Except me. But, that's what I get for ordering seafood in Arizona. The pizzas were warm, but a little light on the sausage topping. 

The cheesecake was especially good, a nice-sized portion, reminiscent of NY cheesecake. The filling was creamy without being too heavy. Guido's cheesecake has a very thin graham cracker crust. 

Be warned: there is an 18% service charge for orders delivered. If this food was served in their dining room, I'd knock them down a star. But, as for delivered pizza/italian food, this is about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Very hard to score guidos this low since we have always loved the best broasted chicken and sandwiches. But after watching an episode of check please, we decided to try other menu items. We ordered the linguine and clams and veal piccata which came with a side plate of spaghetti and red sauce.
Both dishes came out looking like soup. Pasta was overcooked and drenched in liquid and grease. Veal came in the same manner, drenched in sauce although tastier than the pasta, but 1/4 inch of liquid is too much for any dish that is not soup. 
I love your deli, subs, chicken, even pizza but i was extremely disappointed with the pasta which should be the staple of any Italian cooking.
If this was my first experience at guidos i would never go back. I will still go to guidos but never for anything but the broasted chicken or sandwiches"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch given the good review it received from the pbs show \"check please\". I had angle hair which was good but not great.  I was surprised they charged me again for a Coke refill. Not many places are that \"economical\". Too bad, I was hoping for a good Italian lunch place."}
{"text":"such a fun long time gem,
great place to get the decadent gelato  and all your favorite european products, at a great price, and a fantastic italian deli  counter  i am so happy to have remebered this amazing family run place"}
{"text":"Five solid stars for the best meatballs I can remember eating in a LONG time!!!  YUM!

It also didn't hurt that my Husband and I were able to enjoy a couple of beers in frosty mugs (frosty mugs alone = 5 stars) out on the patio while Freddy whipped up a couple of fresh slices of pizza for us.

Fabulous meatballs, frosty mugs and fresh slices of pizza = 5 Stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Guido's we ordered an Italian Roast Beef sandwich and lasagna. The sandwich was served on Guido's bread complete with peppers and au jus. The dinner portion of lasagna was served with garlic bread and a very fresh Side salad with house dressing ( Italiian, of course). The lasagna was covered with a rich creamy bolognese. The ricotta was fluffy and light. The service was excellent. I purchased a pack of Bolocca Crema Latte wafers for dessert. We will go back again with upcoming guests."}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here all the time on my lunch break, and the food is absolutely amazing. Also, the staff is so friendly and knowledgable about everything. I love the history and the family style of this place. I will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"Background: I've had their food 3 separate times but finally made it in there for an on site visit on Saturday. (they deliver and have takeout).  

Food: The first time I had their sandwich at a friends place it was a mozzarella and prosciutto conglomeration of epic amazing awesomeness.  Then when I found out the Chicago connection (as I'm from Chicago) even more cool points awarded.  

Second time, I wanted to try their entrees, so I fired up the pesto gnocchi with shrimp and that too was delicious! The shrimp was fresh tasting and gnocchi cooked to perfection. Large portions too! There were like 8 shrimp! 

Ambiance: Third time went in and fired up another prosciutto and mozzarella sammy and checked the place out. So it's setup like this.  Part store where you can buy all things Italian food, then a deli counter with all types of options (Italian meats, chicken salad, etc), then a counter where you order off menu for to go orders, and then also a sit down restaurant area with a server.  The got it covered!  They have a tv in there and it's totally casual.  I did see some white wine in a fridge that you could likely buy if you wanted to drink it there but didn't see red wine, but I'm sure it's there!  

Service:  The service was great, the gentleman who took my order was very sociable and my sandwich came up very promptly.  

Overall: Major thumbs up and a high five. If you are ever in the area I'd highly recommend this awesome place!"}
{"text":"A splendid Italian deli in Scottsdale.

I frequented Guido's when I lived down the street in Scottsdale.

The food is invariably fresh and tasty.  

The grocery selection of italian staples is fantastic."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta and sauce!  The sausage (also made there) is amazing.  I've been here quite a few times, and have introduced other folks to the place.  Great for takeout, and if you get there early enough, you can dine on premises.  It has a Chicago feel to it, and reminds me of an old Italian grocery I used to frequent."}
{"text":"A home run every time.  The grilled vegetable hero was killer.  Roasted red peppers,  feta cheese,  and fresh basil drizzled with glazed balsamic vinegar. The bread was perfect. The homemade sausage and pepper hero and the antipasto with accompanying garlic bread keeps me coming back. The cannoli split between three of us was a perfect end to a perfect meal in a perfect relaxed setting. Bravo, Guido!"}
{"text":"This place used to be wonderful, but they have seriously gone down hill in the past year. Management, service, and cleanliness are terrible. Stay away..."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch this past Friday.  Gotta say it was pretty good!  I ordered the full Caprese Sandwich (takeout) - it was great!  I was also pretty impressed at how quickly they made my takeout order given the crowd in there.  

I'd recommend calling ahead to place takeout orders to avoid waits.  Another pro tip:  the large menu above the grill doesn't have all of their items listed so, go to the cashier and grab a paper menu - it has everything on it.

Verdict:  highly recommend.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The rating keeps plummeting here at Guido's as does the quality of food. The last chicken parmesan I had here was pretty epic, but now they are breading small strips of chicken (not a full cutlet) and dumping it on their bread with not enough cheese and too big of a roll. They are generous with the parsley. Also, they need to find cooks who understand English better or have someone American taking my order. I clearly said I want half a sandwich to the Mexican cook, yet I got a full sandwich instead. Since I thought it would be a good hero I shook it off, but guess what, the joke was on me in the end."}
{"text":"Guido's is a little ethnic restaurant in a strip mall. It has a real Chicago feel, but the food is less than expected. I ordered linguini with clam sauce. The clams were not fresh. They were minced canned clams. The pasta was cooked a proper al dente but under seasoned. A little garlic would have gone a long way to making it a better dish. One of our guests got the broasted chicken and it was super dry. The raviolis and meatballs were OK, but nothing special. Service was OK. No beers on tap. No cold glasses either. This place would be fine for lunch, but there are a lot better options for an authentic Italian dinner."}
{"text":"This is our go to Italian restaurant for linguine and clam sauce, broasted chicken and the anti pasta salad.  The service is great like the food.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Italian Beef sandwich is crazy good here. I forget the name of my waitress, but she was amazing. \"Above and beyond.\" We were first timers and the food and service made such a good impression on me.. Will be back next time I'm craving one of those Italian beefs."}
{"text":"OMG! Why haven't we been here sooner? Great Chicago style deli and food and I'm from Chicago so I should know. The Italian beef is better than Portillos beef and the homemade Italian sausage flavor was perfect.
Our group tried the broasted chicken, the daily calzone special and the combo sandwich. Pricing was very reasonable and the menu selection huge. I look forward to trying some of the deli products to take home for dinner. Thank goodness for google maps that have led us to Guidos."}
{"text":"Food is hit and miss, and the service is always miss. My first visit I went with a friend and they messed up my order. Not a big deal as they fixed it and brought me a new one. I thought the chicken sandwich was good. My friend had the meatball sandwich which they really enjoyed.

I went back a second time with family and the service was seriously some of the worst I've ever dealt with in any dining experience. There were 4 of us - 2 of us were served the wrong meals, drinks were brought out very late (they forgot one drink), and the gnocchi were pretty bad (I thought it was funny how the chef came out and pulled a packet of gnocchi that was for sale off the shelf right in front of us right after we ordered). We were the only people in the restaurant at the time so we knew it was coming to us.

Besides getting the orders mixed up, the server would ask one person what they wanted, go to the next person, and then go back to the previous person to confirm what they ordered. He had a pad of paper in his hand so I'm not sure if he was writing down our order or doodling."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences of my entire restaurant going life! We waited 10minutes at our booth table before we were greeted and given menus!  We waited another 10 minutes to order. Then, we waited another 25 minutes for our food= 45 minutes!!! We ordered a seafood salad and an eggplant parm sandwhich!!! 2- 5 minutes total to prep these and the pkace was only about 1/2 full, maybe 6 tables of people with only 2 tables of us without food. The owner and manager were sitting in the back yapping and only 3 staff members working with 2 making food. When I inquired for the 2nd time where our food was, it came out. The salad for $13.99 was a smsll dinner salad in a large bowl apable of holding salad dor 4 people that was literally like a child's portion with 6 pieces of calamari on cut up lettuce with 3 thin pieces of yellow pepper pieces only, compared to one giant sized for  a little old lady sitting behind me. The \"whole\" large eggplant parm Sandwhich fir $10.99 was literally 2/3 the size of a subway footlong, hence about 8-9 in long.!! It had a 1- 2\" spec piece of eggplant on one half with a glob of cheese and a ton of sauce. The other half had a 3\" piece like the other. The bread was almost burnt too!! I complained about the salad and they took it back and added about a 1/2 cup of Mir salad and nothing else! When the sandwhich came out just after I complained about that too. The waiter said he would have the mgr/owner come over and did nothing else! Over 5 minutes went buy ad the mgr was talking with a staff member and didn't come over. My wife and I walked out without eating spending almost an hour total in this place. Talk about the worst service, food and atmosphere. The could care less!!! Now, we will tell the 100's of people we know which will turn into 1000's in our in our social circles not to go there nor do business with them. They hould be ashamed!!! They deserve to go out of business!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  From the homemade sausage (which is the best ever), the fresh mozzarella, the bread (I'm from San Francisco and it is difficult to find good bread here), the cannoli, all is excellent.  Don't know how we could have missed it all these years."}
{"text":"Super authentic Italian, it look like a deli Mart when you first walk in which is super cool. They don't have a lot of table due to the market aspect of the store. Its a family business I believe, the wait is a little long but the food is really fresh.The gnocchi is amazing and the best I've ever had you can tell it's handmade it was a bit spicy, they have a really nice and clean bathroom cause I came in plastered drunk and had an incident. ANYWAY GET THE GNOCCHI"}
{"text":"Great Italian deli. Recommend the Chicago Italian hot sandwich.  Also tried the cheesecake and seafood salad. 
Place has an assortment of great deli meats and Italian groceries. Handmade sausage also delicious."}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back soon! The service was fast and friendly. The decor is very unique, and love seeing all the Chicago memorabilia since I'm from the area.  

I tried the chicken parmesan sandwich, great flavor and filling! We shared an order of fries, be careful they are SO addicting. 

Honestly, best fries I have ever had."}
{"text":"My grandparents came over from Sicily so I know Italian and this is really good.  Not only is their dining choices excellent but I love their made in store delicious Italian sausage, both sweet and hot to choose from. I like them both. They have the best pepperoni that I can find anywhere. I have to buy extra to freeze and bring in my suitcase to my sister!!!! My husband eats a big chunk in front of the tv. Their Italian beef and Dip is delicious to take home also.We have eaten their delicious spaghetti and meat balls, but our recent favorite is to share the \"howie's pastrami\" sandwich which is on a huge roll, lots of delicious, lean pastrami and topped with lots of coleslaw. It is messy, but soooo good. I know pastrami doesn't sound Italian, but it is delicious.We also share a 1/2 order of fries. Trust me you will be stuffed.  They also have broasted chicken that looks great, but I love everything else so much I haven't tried it."}
{"text":"Wow. Was looking for a great Italian Beef sandwich and had heard about this place. So had to try. So glad I did. Sandwich was great. Atmosphere was also great. Lots of great Italian food. Service was also superb."}
{"text":"Guido's is my new favorite spot. It has a lot of character and great decorations. The food is amazing. I will most likely be here two or three times a week. The servers are friendly and helpful. Overall this is a must if you like good Italian food. I can't wait to try everything!"}
{"text":"One of the more amazing finds thanks to Yelp.   I would not have found this place just passing by on the street.  It's a bit out of the way in the Safeway shopping center.  Everytime I've gone, everything was really fresh and flavorful.  I especially like the Italian sub.  Probably the best sandwich I've ever had.  I wish there was a place like this near where I live, I'd go there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Even though I am from Pittsburgh I love this neighborhood CHICAGO Italian Delli. In 30
Years I've only had great food here. When in Scottsdsle this should be a must-go destination."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I've ever had. We have been in countless times and never had a bad meal. We have gotten take out, food to go to prepare at home, and eaten here. The wings and calamari are our favorite appetizers on the menu. Anything on the menu is excellent from the best ceasar salad, the chicken parm sub, spaghetti and meatballs, are all some of our all time favorite entree's. Just tried the cannoli for the first time yesterday and it was probably the best cannoli I've ever had. One of the best restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Been back a few times since my first review. The food is still amazing. I have been getting there early, guessing before all of the staff arrives, but after they are open. The morning staff, especially the guy usually on the grill, just lack the friendly service I get when I go later in the day and get to deal with a waitress or the owner. I will keep going but hoping they read this about the 'morning experience'."}
{"text":"Just arrived from the Scottsdale mall at around 7pm sat.  The place had one booth and one table taken. We took a booth. It was a first visit, we announced it and we're welcomed. We ordered a sausage and peppers large sandwich and an eggplant large sandwich with 2 sodas. We got up and walked around to see all of the items they sold in the rest of the store. . While the restaurant section menu prices are more in line to being reasonable a large homemade excellent fresh made sausage is $5.99 a lb. about 3/4 of one sausage. You decide. Our sausage and peppers hero was excellent and the toasted bread perfectly crunchy and the red sauce just right. The price was excellent for the large sandwich.. The eggplant sandwich was also excellent. We took home a meat ball sandwich which was very nice but not as good as Casanova Brothers sandwiches in GILBERT. They are #1. I definitely give GUIDOS #2 and when in SCOTTSDALE mall it's a short ride to Shea Blvd for some delicious sandwiches at reasonable prices. 3 large sandwiches a coke and ginger ale plus tax $41.00 and we had enough for a 2nd dinner the next night and a half  and a little more! Very nice atmosphere and Maria was a pleasant server!"}
{"text":"How authentic of a Chicago place is Guido's?  Well, they have Old Style beer in the Frig!

Guido's is really a Chicago Italian deli, that doubles as sandwich and pasta place.  The food is good, but where they excel are with items from their deli case.  Take for instance the italian sausage.  It's home made and delicious.  Really!  You should come here just to order it for lunch, or to take a roll of it home for cooking.

As we were waiting for our dinner order to arrive, I decided to walk around the store.  The specialty salads looked amazing.  If I hadn't already ordered, the calamari salad really looked good.  I don't know how it tastes, but I made a mental note to come back for lunch and try it.

They also have a wide selection of non deli items, but the prices can be high.  The San Marzano brand of Marinara pasta sauces was marked $12.99 on a dusty jar.  The same sauce at Whole Foods is $8.75.  That 12 oz can of Old Style I mentioned above?  Well, it was $4.00.  I could go on, but you can see where I am going.

Competition can be a wonderful thing, Guido's reminds me very much of DeFalco's further down Scottsdale Road and south of Old Town. If you live north of here, then Guido's is a viable alternative. http://www.yelp.com/biz/defalcos-italian-grocery-scottsdale#hrid:4ltqc2OvnsY8NUYW-NLU-w 

For dinner we ordered the Chicken Parmesan and bowl of Angel Hair with sausage and meatballs.  Both came with a house salad.  The marinara sauce was good, but somewhat bland, without the taste of any garlic or oregano. Along with two Ice Teas, our meal ran us $35.90 including taxes, but before gratuities.  

Guido's is Three Stars, \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"Guido's is awesome! I came in not expecting Chicago food and left full and surprised that the food tastes just like it does in Chicago. I had the Chicago roast beef sub and it was great. This hoagie roll was loaded with hot roast beef, peppers, and onions along with some dipping sauce. I will definitely be going back to this place when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Searched for some Italian delis in the valley. I wanted something I am accustomed to from back east and in the Midwest. Everything looked good to go online with this place so I headed out. Walked in and 3 different employees walked past us and not even a smile or can I help you. Granted, they seemed to be serving on the restaurant side, still it's a bad customer experience. Finally, walking back and forth the sandwich area and deli, different employees saw us and still didn't ask if we needed anything. I finally had to walk by the serving station and ask if we could et some help by the deli case. The woman said \"oh, you want something\"... So when she came to the deli we asked how much the mortadella was a pound and she just rattled off a price and that was it. We literally walked out. 
This is a bummer that the service sucked because we were ready to buy about 5 different meats, cheese, olives, bread and cannoli shells along with some Pollyo and would have been return customers because the place looked great and quality was on point just looking at it. Price, doesn't matter in this equation because I will (as most will) pay for quality. 
Please also keep in mind that this was not at dinner time, it was about 330 pm so perhaps they were on boarding the evening wait staff, but again, no excuse for not acknowledging people. 
This bums me out more than anything because this place has the potential to be slam packed and it's not a wannabe Italian deli either, it's legit. 
I will be back for another try, hopefully this was an off day."}
{"text":"Great Italian food and market. Quite the variety of foods there is something for everyone. Wait staff was great and very attentive. I would go there again"}
{"text":"Guidos did it again. My wife was in the area and picked up some takeout. Didn't check the bag and items left out...AGAIN!
Food is good here but if you get takeout check your order. 
Giving them one star because this happens continually."}
{"text":"Best place in Phoenix for Italian groceries and food.  Excellent menu for dining at the store!!!"}
{"text":"I am a Long time customer - Resturant offers homemade cooked food and from scratch .. Resturant is family owned and operated not a chain Resturant- worth the trip and money!!
Owner is often working and in the store to see hello and supervises his staff.
Broasted fish and chicken are excellent when you fall off the diet. 
Many good Italian dishes and pizza is good too.
Excellent cold cuts and cheeses and utilizing bread."}
{"text":"Outstanding, outstanding, outstanding. Happened across this place on Urbanspoon - for some reason it wasn't showing up on Yelp. What a hidden gem! Authentic Italian food and atmosphere. This really is a trip to Chicago hidden in a shopping center. 

Upon entering we were enthusiastically greeted by the owner, who must have overheard us talking about getting an Italian Beef, and pitched us a turkey sub with fries special he had going on. I got the turkey sub, my husband got the Italian beef.

Service was outstanding. Our food was out within 10 minutes of ordering and our waitress was very attentive. The owner came and inspected our dishes after they were served and joked with us briefly. 

Our only regret is we are only in town from the Midwest for one day and can't come back every single day for something different! We will make this a place we come back to every time we are out here now though!"}
{"text":"Guido's has recently become my go-to for fresh cookies, biscotti, and other treats, but I finally decided to sit down and take part in their restaurant experience. 

It's really a cute little diner, and other than being a restaurant, it also is an entire Italian grocery store. They have all the Italian cooking ingredients you would need along with the cookies, gelato, and even clothing that you can buy. Plus, the place is all one room, so you can see the chefs cooking right in front of you. It all really adds to the ambiance as if it was something you would see on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives. 

When we walked in, we were immediately seated, even though the restaurant was quite busy. The service was friendly and attentive, too. We started off ordering the calamari appetizer that was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the calamari was not tough at all, which can be a problem for Arizona restaurants. We received the calamari first, but it was a little slow getting out the rest of the orders (I don't really blame them, though, since it was quite busy with customers and take-out orders). I ordered the pesto ravioli while my friends ordered chicken piccata and soup. It was all good, home style food, but too heavy for my taste. The best thing we tried was their red sauce spaghetti that comes with the chicken, but I was underwhelmed by my dish. It was not only very heavy, but was a \"one-note\" kind of dish. 

Overall, they have a good range of Italian food that would be great for a night out, but nothing that would make me want to sit down in their restaurant again soon. For now I'll just have to stick with their yummy treats."}
{"text":"Mediocre Italian, at best. Seems like the place needs a facelift and new management.  Owner was rude."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot hidden in a strip mall.  Everything I've eaten on the menu is great.  The owner is very personable and add to the authentic feel of this grocery store/ deli."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant/deli highlighted on 'Check Please! Arizona' and was compelled to come for dinner with my very good friend. It is a spacious deli with several tables available where servers take care of your order. When you walk in you are welcomed by the Italian grocery on the right and the deli counter on your left. If you're ordering to go, you walk straight up the the counter to place your order - we weren't sure of the protocol, so went up to order when we met Joe Guido himself and learned that for dinner service you seat yourself. Joe's voice is just as delicious in person as it was in the interview on 'Check Please! Arizona!' :). We were there relatively early on a Saturday (around 6pm) so found a table after a few min and the line formed out the door. 

We ordered the antipasto misto appetizer, chicken piccata, chicken marsala and 2 pieces of breasted chicken. Joe treated us each to a cannoli. The antipasto plate was delicious - definitely good for sharing. The chicken piccata was very good - I subbed vegetables for pasta and my friend had the chicken marsala which was generously portioned - she could only manage half. I really enjoyed the belated chicken leg...so crispy and flavorful on the outside and juicy on the inside. Neither of us had room for cannoli, so that will be breakfast!

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their bread is sooooo good, which in turn means their sandwiches are amazing!  All of the sandwiches I've tried are good but, I usually get a half a turkey sub with a side of hot peppers and coleslaw.  I could literally eat tubs of their slaw.  It's the best slaw I've ever had in my life!  The broasted chicken is also delicious.  It was juicy, full of flavor, and not greasy.  The fries were amazing as well.  Their salads are delicious too.  They're full of meat cheese and veggies and their dressing is delicious.  Their desserts are also very good.  I've tried the cannoli and cheesecake, both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Poor service mediocre food. NY NJ native we appreciate Chicago food, this was very poor imitation of Italian food."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! I was craving Italian and stopped in this gem alone for dinner. I was initially going to order to go, but the hospitality I received made me dine in. The manager Manny greeted me warmly and offered me their featured wine. He made recommendations and told me some history of the restaurant. I ordered mostaccioli al forno with meatballs! It comes with a nice dinner salad with their homemade Italian dressing. Everything was delicious! The pasta is very filling. Made with ricotta cheese and topped with mozzarella and I added meatballs. My whole experience was just perfect and I never even felt like I was dining alone because the service was so friendly! I will be making this my new Italian spot!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  One of the best sandwiches in Scottsdale, and they truly make you feel at home here.  I try to stop by at least once a month for something over here.   Great for an affordable meal or for some fresh deli when you don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Flew to AZ for a conference and found Guido's on several searches.  It was close (6 miles) from my hotel.  After flying all night and morning I was starving and found the shopping center Guido's was located in and went right in.  Old school Italian deli I have encountered on my mainland trips and was very happy.

Starving I ordered a half Chicago special with Italian beef and sausage, a whole Italian combo and a Greek salad to go.  Ran over to Safeway next door to get a six pack of craft beer.  Got back to the hotel and had a feast.

The next day I was planning on eating with some folks but fell through.  Tried to get a reservation on my own, but too late to book any thing and landed up at Guido's again.  Had the Veal Piccata, a small Guido's combo pizza and some desert cookies.  Back to the hotel to polish off the meal with the left over beer.  Fantastic, nothing like it here in Hawaii.

Two days later, leaving for the airport, I swung by to pick up two sandwiches for the long flights back to Honolulu and cookies for my family.  Sandwiches were the Italian combo and the cappicola/salami.  Great homemade Italian cookies, also.

All in all, no better place to find Italian food.  Real old school and family run to boot.  Owner, Joe Guido is there all the time I was there and is a really friendly to all his customers, new and old."}
{"text":"Haven't been in for years but the home made sausages were killer!"}
{"text":"We came back to Guidos as it has been a couple of years.  Guido's needs an establishment in So. Cal.  It would do terrific business!!  A great deli that serves meals on the other side of the house.  They also have a small but great selection of condiments for cooking and other items to make a great dinner at home as well.

We had the Pastrami sandwich and of course the broasted chicken.  First off, the service was terrific.  Our server was great.  He was friendly, knowledgeable and on top of everything!!

The bang for the buck is pretty good here.  The Broasted Chicken platter which is 4 pieces of awesome broasted chicken, salad, great toasted garlic bread and three large pieces of broasted potatoes.  

The flavor on all the items was on point and it was great to see the QA is still in tact and the food was just terrific.  All that food for just $14.  

The Pastrami Sandwich was also very good and tasty and served on a nicely toasted roll.  I could not find one thing wrong with our visit.  The food was superb, the service was awesome and the bang for the buck was perfect.

We finished off our dinner with their chocolate cake and three servings of their Gelato.  White Chocolate, Rasberry (WOW!!!!) and Pistachio.  I thought the serving was going to be normal but each serving was the size of a baseball.  LOL!!!!  It was funny as I could not eat all of this and had much to share with everyone.  It is absolutely worth trying.  The cake was light and not dense with good consistency and flavor and the Gelato was just terrific.  

Once again, I highly recommend going to Guido's!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Guido's a few times and have enjoyed the Chicken Parmasean Sandwich, Spaghetti, Italian Sausage Sandwich and the 1/2 Italian Sub at today's visit. 

Management - Please train your wait staff, I asked how large the whole and half Italian Sub was and she couldn't tell me. Was the small 4 1/2 inches was it 6 inches, etc.? 

Guido's advertises on their web site \"all you can eat Spaghetti from 5pm-7pm on Thursday for $5.95\", but the waitress said they didn't do that anymore. Management - Please take the special off your web site because you're losing credibility. 

And why is Chicken Vesuvio not on the menu? That's a pretty standard dish in Italian eateries in Chicago."}
{"text":"Short Story-

Italian Grocery Store, Deli and Market - Very Good 

Italian Hoagie - above average and very good 

House made hot Italian sausage sandwich- ok would have been very good if sausage wasn't overcooked. Peppers were cooked nicely and bread was good. Fresh basil was a nice touch.

Broasted Chicken- Unseasoned, dry meat. Horrible. Came with tasty potatoes and an average salad and pedestrian garlic toast.

Service- above average

Restroom- NONE so don't even think about refills.


Additional Notes-

Broasted chicken is suppose to be a juicier chicken with a crispy exterior that's more healthy than deep fried chicken. Broasted Chicken is made by a pressure cooker/fryer. The chicken is suppose to be marinated first and then battered. I don't know what was done here but it seemed like chicken out of the freezer that got thrown in a microwave, dipped in flour without seasoning. As the chicken sat on my plate it continued to dry even more. Maybe the regular crew wasn't on and I got the newbie cook or dishwasher filling in to prepare food.

I am generously averaging this review to a positive three stars because overall it was mostly positive and just a bad day for broasted chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic Italian food. The minestrone was very flavorful and my husband's chicken parmesan sandwich was really good. Everything is made from scratch! What a wonderful secret place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food is out of this world & the staff treat you like family. I ate the lasagna, side salad w/bread twice in the two weeks and was not disappointed. I considered posting a picture of my food but that's the last thing I'm thinking about when it hits the table."}
{"text":"There are a lot of places in Phoenix Metro where you can get a good Italian sub, but only a handful where you can score a great Italian sub. Guido's is one of them.

Their subs, hot or cold, are some of the best in the area. I say this tongue in cheek, mainly because if you're from New York or Philly you'll disagree with my 'great' assessment. But do try to keep in mind this is the desert. 
Where we don't have decent breads unless the deli is buying local from MJ or Arizona Bread Company, which they typically don't.
The cold cuts are Boar's heads and not imported. 
And the tomatoes are desert tomatoes, not Jersey sweets.

So there IS a difference, you're right NY and Philly, but once you get off your high horse and figure out there aren't a whole lot of places to choose from here, you'll eat Guido's and you'll like it goddammit. Ughhh.  

I visit here regularly to restock my fridge with fresh olives, imported provolone, and Margherita pepperoni, one of the few places that has it. They also have decent homemade biscotti and pizzelles. Their homemade sausage is tasty too. Not the best, just tasty.

If you often find yourself eating at any of the chain sub shops around town, give yourself a break from the insufferable shit they call 'Italian' and try Guido's. 

Guido's.
Where in light of everything, easier (and cheaper) than a trip to New York, Philly, or Atlantic City."}
{"text":"I went to this gem of a place today for lunch with my aunt and niece,they had been there before but I had not.  I had a great sandwich called a prosciutto caprese, it had fresh mozzarella and basil on it and the bread was divine.  The whole sandwich with the tomatoes and oil combined with the fresh bread,prosciutto cut perfectly, homemade  (I'm guessing) mozzarella, served with broasted fries is on my top ten sandwiches I've ever had.  My aunt had an Italian sub that was delicious as well, but even she liked mine better. My niece got a little bowl of spaghetti which she loved almost as much as the chocolate cake we shared after.  It's a great environment,with real italian products for sale, deli items, baked goods, canolis that we took home are great too.  However, there was a bald man who may have been the manager or owner that was barking orders to his employees rather rudely it seemed. Also the air conditioning must have been broken because I was sweltering,  so was everyone else there.  It was hard to enjoy the experience when we were sweating the whole time. The waitress was great, I think her name was Jane, i know it began with a 'J' and she had long brown hair and big beautiful brown eyes, and a great smile. She was busy but still had time to be friendly,even when the guys were ringing a bell while she was talking (very disturbing ) she got all of our orders right, got the food out fast, and recommended the Caprese when I asked her about the best sandwiches they had. 
       So besides the air conditioning being out or not set low enough I would go back to this place, but I'd  rather order to go instead of sweating in there.  I'd like to try the chicken,it looked great."}
{"text":"What a find on the corner of Shea and N. scottsdale Blvd.  Great tasting food, great service, great menu.  The pizza was to die for and did not upset the senior stomach.  The broasted chicken, the best ever, the spaghetti w sausage or meatball fantastic using a home made sauce.  Cannot say anything less about this place with some outside seating.   If your looking for fantastic food in a none formal setting, this is the place.  I will definitely return to this one."}
{"text":"The food is generally good but service is poor.  They add a $4.99 up charge for sauce.  I was told to order lasagna and when I didn't like it, was told they must charge me.  They wouldn't comp and insisted on charging me for lasagna I didn't eat.  Avoid this place - everything is an upcharge and customer service is awful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for Double Zero flour to make fresh pasta, and were very happy to find it at Guido's. This place is packed with almost every Italian treat you can imagine, and the prices were very reasonable. They also have a deli where they serve fresh food and sandwiches - we would definitely come back for lunch on another visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I told my mom to take me to somewhere good we could sit down and have an actual meal. She chose this, she has some obsession with deli's of late. I had the eggplant entree with spaghetti and garlic bread. The eggplant had a not so fresh color and it was a bit too salty for my taste. The spaghetti was great the sauce was sweet and fresh unlike the eggplant. This was lunch time mind you maybe no one orders eggplant parm so much. The garlic bread was delicous and next time I will just try a sandwich or pizza. The service was excellent the place was nice it wasn't busy. They had framed write ups in the paper posted. I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, but don't expect amazing service.  Freshest calamari I've had in a while.  The server we had was was not good about simple things.  For example, we had to ask for plates for our starter item, which was brought out without any forks or knives. She made three separate trips back and forth from our table just for the starter.  Before taking our drink orders she took drink orders from a table which was seated after us.  It was very noticeable.  I'm not sure if the service follies were intentional or just because she wasn't a good server.  She was outwardly nice - just not efficient.     

I like that there are some authentic grocery items available for purchase as well.  Generally a good place.  Like the rating says, my overall experience was \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but not any better than other Italian delis in the area.  Service is horrible and it's complete Chaos in there.  Nobody knows what is going on.  Took more than 30 minutes to get out of there with a simple salad and soup order...  AND, they got the salad wrong.  Was the third order in a row they got wrong while I was there and they didn't seem to care.  Do yourself a favor and avoid the aggravation and spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. It's gone to hell. Ordered a sandwich today and it came out incorrect three times while the rest of my party finished their meal. The food has taken a turn towards cost cutting I think. Quality has suffered. Too bad....It was a favorite."}
{"text":"2nd visit in less than a week. Some minor issues each time but the food is so damn good that we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"We've been twice. The first time was a pop in since we'd been intrigued by the name. We are a family of four with two younger kids. The second time, we took my parents. We loved it. My son ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Loved the sauce and meatballs. The pasta was fresh. I ordered salad both times. Fresh and the chicken add was amazing. My husband ordered the meatball sub. Delish!  When my parents came, they ordered the pastrami sub and the sausage subs. Commented in the amazing bread and meats. They want to go back!  Last thing- soups are to die for!

On service, both times we went early lunch. Our waitress was accommodating, sweet and fast. In seeing other reviews on service, I would recommend going early lunch or early dinner to beat the rush. 

I would and have recommend Guidos many times."}
{"text":"The kids really enjoyed soup and sandwich and the waitress was kind enough to split a single order between the two of them, to make it kid size. My husband really enjoyed the pastrami sandwich and my stuffed shells were good, but the french fries were awesome!"}
{"text":"Great chicken parm, incredible prosciutto caprese sandwich!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, but I miss the casual old neighborhood place.  I used to stop in for quick sandwiches all the time -- you'd walk up to the counter, order a sandwich to go, and the very efficient guys behind the counter would have you walking out with a great sub in just a few minutes.

For the last year, though, it's table service.  Same good food, but slower and more expensive.  An Italian sub (no side) and a coke is now $14 with a 20% tip. Sure it's good, but that's not something I'm going to do every day."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten at Guido's Chicago Meat Deli, you have missed some of the best food in Scottsdale.
In Scottsdale Easter week and had to eat again at Guido's. Took home some homemade sausage and last night had peppers, onions and sausage.  Outstanding!!!
If you haven't been you've missed a great eating place!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it smells as soon as you walk in. I had one of their pastas which was great and the rest of my family had sandwiches-- everyone was content. Their sammies are for sure huge, either share with a friend or get a half. They don't have a lot of tables so I think most people just do carry out. I also noticed some outdoor seating and people bringing their pups to the patio :) Also I'm pretty sure all their market goods are imported or homemade which is really unique niche if you think about it."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! It's been in AZ since 1980 and I only learned of it within the last few years. It's a combination of italian deli and sit-down restaurant. Surprisingly, the pizza wasn't very good, but they offer broasted chicken and broasted fish with broasted potato wedges or broasted fries and it is amazingly and consistently delicious. We drive from Glendale to eat here and then drive back home - it is so worth it. We've had broasted chicken at other places but we've never seen anyone else offer broasted fish. It's like thick nuggets of cod in a light batter and it is so good (comes with coleslaw, chicken meal comes with salad or coleslaw).

They serve you hot garlic bread in a basket that is often made from Italian bread, French bread and even a sesame French bread, baked on premises!

We've never had to wait to be seated and its one reason my wife and I do NOT like to go out to eat on a Friday or Saturday night in the Phoenix metropolitan area, where dine-in restaurants commonly have a  1-2 hour wait before getting a table (Grimaldi's, Texas Roadhouse, Applebees, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Cheesecake Factory, etc...etc...)

They also sell dry pastas, sauces and oils imported from Italy as well as offer a variety of fresh baked goods, I also like that I can pick up the latest copy of the free New Times newspaper there.

The pasta dishes are excellent. The only thing we've had they we were disappointed with is the pizza - which is kind of shocking, given how good everything else is and how authentically Italian it is otherwise.

Haven't tried anything from the deli. We go there primarily for the broasted fish and broasted chicken. You have to try both and decide which you like better (most people I take prefer the fish, but agree they are both great!).

Prices are very reasonable and lots of menu items to select from. And they serve Coke products. What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"Good, solid traditional Italian food in comfortable unpretentious atmosphere. A place you can eat twice a week. Def worth a try. Good dessert also  and generally friendly service"}
{"text":"This has been a great spot for years. Great sandwiches and pasta dishes.  It's a store to with greasy made pastas and salads. Where else in Scottsdale can you buy Old Style beer!?!  They always have sausage with peppers and onions and lasagna ready to go."}
{"text":"Typical Italian deli. Fresh and tasty. Seafood salad is a winner. Also their Broasted Chicken is very good. Service can be spotty at lunchtime. However dinner service is much better."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Every time I pass through Phoenix, I have to go here to pick up some cookies and pastas, and also get lunch. My family and I love the margarita pizza, really any of their pizzas are good. I love spaghetti and meatballs, and their meatballs are fantastic. Their sandwiches are amazing, and their ricotta cheesecake is the best in the world. Service is friendly, and the environment is really cute and has an authentic Chicago/Italian market vibe. They have all kinds of cool things in the market, like authentic Italian products (I.e. Coffee soda--so good). Go to Guido's!"}
{"text":"Decent Chicago/New York style Italian deli - their meatballs are great, I wish I'd ordered a whole meatball sandwich.  We tried the broasted chicken and potatoes which were pretty delicious, but as far as fried chicken (or close to it) goes it isn't anything to rave about.  Overall, definitely would go back but it's hanging onto 4 rating by a fingernail."}
{"text":"Drove to this place from Litchfield Park 1 1/2 hr round trip good prices and great food made it worth it. As soon as you walk thru the door you feel like you've been sent through some sort of time warp back to Old Time Chicago. From the Deli style counters to the booths for dining in this is a great date spot. The staff was helpful and friendly which made me feel very welcome and at home.  The only negative because well nothing is perfect is that no one welcomed us as we came in and it was mildly awkward figuring out where to place a take out order. Yet that still dims in comparison to my experience. Shout out to @Fox10 news you hit it out of the park with this recommendation!"}
{"text":"They have my favorite Chicken Parm sandwich AND the best French fries in town.   

The fries are thicker than most but smaller than a steak-cut and they practically melt in your mouth.  I had never had fries like these...they are incredible.

They finish the sandwich off in the oven so the bread is lightly crunchy when it comes out.  I did get a sandwich that was a little overdone for my taste once, and didn't notice it until after I had left with my to go order so keep an eye on that.  I think the food quality may suffer a bit when the owner isn't working. 

The Calzones are huge and taste pretty good. 

The Cannoli from their deli are a favorite in our office."}
{"text":"I always over order when I come to Guido's.  It's just so hard to make a decision.  Their sandwiches are HUUUUGE.  My favorite is the proscuitto caprese sandwhich, which is just stuffed with proscuitto.  All of their pastas are great as well and I can't ever seem to leave without ordering calamari.

Quite the little gem of the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Italian food places in the area that I have found!  Everything is fresh and made from scratch.  It's hidden in the corner of a Safeway shopping center I would never think to go in for Italian food but now I'm just mad I have lived in the area for 10 years and just found this place about a year ago."}
{"text":"This place made me sangry (sad + angry). I really wanted to like it as an Italian who works right around the corner. 

Went here with my work team for lunch on a Friday and the service was so slow I missed my regular after-lunch meeting with my boss. Not cool! Not only did the food take forever to come out, paying the bill felt like it took just as long as eating. As we were wrapping up, I let the waitress know we were in a hurry, but it was at least 10 minutes until we got our check. I walked up to the counter area to ask her about it, and it was clear there was some confusion about our bill and what we ordered. Probably because one in our party was served well before everyone else (probably someone else's pasta), one who ordered chicken for her pasta never got it, and other general poor service related issues. She asked me to sit back down and said she'd bring it out to us, so I sat for countless minutes more until I eventually went up to her again only to have her tell me she thought she'd dropped it off already and had it in her apron pocket. OMG was I seeing red by that time. 

If the food had at least been good, I might have been in a better mood,... but out of the six of us not ONE of us enjoyed the meal. The food was mediocre - like my reheated manicotti that seemed like a frozen Marie Callender's someone heated in the microwave. The garlic bread was rock hard and only edible after soaking it in red sauce for a few minutes to soften it out of desperation because the rest of our food was terrible.

Looking back at the reviews, perhaps sandwiches to-go might be alright, but I would never repeat our pasta eat-in experience ever again."}
{"text":"Interesting! 
Old school Chicago Italian decorated place.
The service is a bit slow. 
The food is not good just looks good. 
I guess this place went down."}
{"text":"Food here is so good. I've tried a variety of things including the meatball and sausage sandwich. My favorites are the calzones and the grilled chicken sandwich. If you haven't been yet, try it and you'll soon be a regular"}
{"text":"Awesome deli! Salami is awesome and pizza pasta is top notch! Worth the drive from Tempe."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. You want an Italian grocer/restaurant just like this but much better......you head to andreoli Italian grocer also in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really great place to eat! My boyfriend comes here pretty often and recently has been raving about an off the menu sandwich. It's a caprese sandwich with eggplant parmesan. It has fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, balsamic and thin crispy eggplant parmesan on a baguette. You must try! This was so amazing I'm still thinking about it.
It's a huge sandwich so you'll definitely want to split it. I'll be back for more of this and to try their canolis!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great food. The broasted French fries were amazing and the Italian sub and chicken Parmesan sub were both great too. Definitely will be back and will try something different."}
{"text":"Soooo I've been at this place for over an hour with my family.... Worst service I've had in quite some time. I hope the foods good"}
{"text":"It's rare to find authentic delis in AZ, whether it's Chicago or otherwise, but this one is defintely a gem tucked away in a complex. Friendly service and welcoming atmosphere with plenty of deli products for purchase. Ordered the Chicago Roast Beef sandwich and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"When you walk in, the smell of awesome Italian food is almost enough to induce drooling! Can't tell you how much I enjoyed lunch here yesterday. We were a group of 4, and found a table immediately. The server (Maria) was reasonably fast given how busy the place was, and. although it took a while to arrive, the food was out of this world! 
Finding an Italian restaurant that serves low carb food is almost impossible, but Guido's actually has more than one item on the menu that I could eat without substitutions ... and they were unbelievably tasty. To top it all off, since I'm a pretty handy cook myself, I'm forever wishing I had my spice rack with me when I eat out - this is the first time I haven't thought that in ages!
Give it a try, and be willing to take your time. Food this good isn't instant!"}
{"text":"Been to Guido's so many times always great food and service. The deli is my favorite get a couple pounds of roast beef made in house with the au ju and house made Italian sausage some provolone cheese  the fresh Italian bread and you have the the best sandwich's around fry up a few green peppers and you have it. They also have gairdiniera and a killer garlic pasta tomato Parmesan salad a little expensive but soooo good ."}
{"text":"Broasted chicken is delicious and garlic bread is to die for!"}
{"text":"First time to visit Guidos.  Holy cow!!!  This place is legit!  Best pasta we've had in years!  Garlic bread and salad with entree.  You don't find that in Scottsdale much these days.  Fun deli style ambience.  Full service and service was excellent!  We will be back many, many times and with friends!!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great food, Pasta Fagoli was great, had the Guiltless Guido also excellent choice. We will be back."}
{"text":"Took my son to Guido's today for lunch.  He had the meatball hero and I had the veal parm hero.  Both were very good.  Sauce was salty and garlicy, veal was clearly pounded and tender service was right on and the atmosphere was perfectly 'jointy'.  As a tip, buy some of their fresh mozarella.  Simply delicious."}
{"text":"My second place for amazing sandwiches. Their Hot Pastrami is out of this world the best I have ever had.

Its a great store and restaurant with great food I recommend the Italian Sausage and meatball subs as well. if you are in the neighborhood stop by you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I wanted to try this place out. Saw some less than great Yelp reviews and wasn't sure we should go. Decided to try it and showed up Saturday night with 7 people. Very busy, but they put two tables together in a couple minutes and we were seated. Immediately someone had to use the bathroom and I remembered a review that said they did not have one. That is NOT correct, they have bathrooms.
So a busy restaurant with a table of 7 and we all wanted to try something, but wanted changes to almost everything. This was no problem and everything we ordered came out fairly quickly and correctly. Guido delivered some of the dishes and wanted to know where we were putting everything. Told him we wanted to try everything and we would do it family style. He even offered to split them in the kitchen but we just had him put everything in the middle of the table.
We had pasta with homemade sausage, salads, pizza, and broasted chicken. Everything was very good. Not the best pizza in the valley but in the top 10. Sausage was perfect. For desert, the huge chocolate cake and cannoli's (pistachio and chocolate chip). A small fight broke out at the end for who was going to get the last bites.
Service was great. Very friendly. We will be back.
Guido came outside when we left and asked how everything was and to thank us for coming in. Nice touch."}
{"text":"There is one reason, that sticks out like a sore thumb why I have them 5 stars.  THEY HAVE MARGARITA BRAND PEPPERONI!!! Seriously this is like the only place in town I could find it. When I walked in and saw \"Boars Head\" brand I was really irritated that an Italian specialty grocery store would sell Safeway grade deli meats. But then I asked and they had it. So amp'ed."}
{"text":"We died and wet to Italian deli heaven! 
The Chicago combo was fantastic.
Sadly the fish and other meets are cross contaminated, so my Father had to be careful with what he chose. Otter then that, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came in for a sandwich and found myself getting an AMAZING toasted italian sub with a side salad. Absolutely outstanding.  The person at the counter was friendly and informative, and helped with suggestions. They have an amazing menu of Italian cuisine, and they also have frozen, fresh and Italian product market items you can purchase to take home. I truly recommend them if you are around Shea and Scottsdale road for a great lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"even if you aren't going to get a full meal, you NEED to get a cannoli.. or maybe 5. best I have ever had in my life. every time I get something to go I wish I would have ordered one more."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I ever had!! The broasted french fries are delicious too! This place is a full on store as well. You can find anything from raviolis to authentic Italian cookies. The owner, Joe, is a great guy too! If your lucky, he might personally make your sandwich!"}
{"text":"Some amazing ass food is cooked in this place.
A coworker recommended this place for lunch and I'm glad he did. Very warm cozy Chicago style eatery. Wait staff were all very pleasant and attentive. I ordered the broasted chicken with coleslaw. Bomb! The chicken was moist and juicy and delish. Coworkers ordered half sandwiches (meatball parm and Italian). Everyone cleared their plates. 

We decided to finish with a bang and order a cannoli for desert. It was my first time having one and it was an amazing experience. Definitely will return to try their pasta dishes and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Lov this place.  Italian subs, specialty italian foods, homemade salsicc!  Table service and pizza.  When u want to hear some south side and have great food, go here."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great.  Order at the counter, fast and excellent sandwiches.  Love the Sandwiches, Salami, Caprese and Meatball.  Favorite place to go after golfing on this side of town."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Awesome atmosphere and food is top notch! It was worth the 30 mile drive for me!"}
{"text":"Best Italian sausage and roast beef in the valley hands down! The have a huge selection of Italian groceries too. Also the homemade cannolis are delicious!"}
{"text":"100 check-ins pretty much sums it up. I'm hooked on their good service, familiar faces, delicious food and the charming, casual, deli-style setting. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Did some take out meals for dinner and the food is terrific! The pesto ravioli is terrific and the eggplant parm is even better. We also ordered pasta primavera with marinara sauce and it was excellent as well. Meals. Amen with nice fresh salads and garlic bread. All terrific! We got a few Italian pastries for dessert- YUM!! Great place that I always visit when I visit Scottsdale. If you haven't been here, you need to get here!"}
{"text":"Well we were in the area and stopped in for lunch. It's a small, deli type of place, a few tables, restroom was clean well stocked. Staff was nice, it wasn't slammed busy but there were several customers and we didn't have any issues with service as I have read on some of the reviews.

I feel kinda bad basing my review on a sandwich, but it's what I ordered. I ordered a hot pastrami sandwich a half, the bread was crispy, fresh and soft inside. It was topped with lettuce, two slices of tomato and onions with italian dressing mayo and mustard. It's enough to get full of off, does it scream something special... Not in my opinion. 
My husband ordered the Italian sausage it was an encased sausage topped with marinara sauce and cheese, onions and green peppers, he ordered a whole and he just said it was ok, at 12 bucks he said he coulda ordered something better. We also so ordered a side of fries, nothing special there either. 
I wouldn't say it's a terrible place, I'd say a little pricey, for just ok food. It's not something I'd crave or run to, don't even think we would go back."}
{"text":"This was excellent. I've lived in the area for 7 years and never stopped in, now I'm regretting it! I know it's Chicago but it reminded my husband of the places they'd eat at in Little Italy in NYC when he was growing up. I had the antipasto salad, I have not been able to find one like this in the Phoenix area since I left NY. Loved it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just so so.... had the pesto ravioli it was tasteless.
Hot sandwich pastrami was pretty good.
Ordered a pizza to go.... $24 gets you four or five pieces of sausage barely any cheese and  doey crust.
Everything totaled $70 they are so winning!!"}
{"text":"Great place - authentic Italian subs and grocery items."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here for lunch today.  The service was quick the waitress was very sweet and friendly.  I ordered the meatball sub and my fiance had the grilled chicken salad.  The bread on my sub was delicious and the meatball had great flavor!  I love that their sauce is slightly sweet and the fresh basil on top was a great touch.  His chicken salad was great as well! They sell so many delicious treats and Italian packaged foods, as well.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, there is so much that is good and wonderful about this place! I'm so glad that we found it. Let me tell you first and foremost that the food is oh so very good and the portion sizes are more than generous! Be prepared to be stuffed! Secondly, the service is quite friendly. If you are eating in please know it's a relatively small place so be prepared for a wait if you are coming at a busy time (Saturday at dinner time - watch out)! That's not to say that I'm encouraging you to opt for take out. I'm not. The food is worth the wait and always best enjoyed fresh and hot out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Dig this place. It helps that it is within long-boarding distance of the crib, but even if it wasn't, I'd still make the drive. Granted it is located in a strip-mall, but what isn't down here. Very authentic Chicago-style deli feel to the inside, a handful of booths, tables and a few spots to sit outside on the sidewalk if that's what you prefer. Typically I get the Meatball Parmesan sandwich, the meatballs are fantastic, (that's a good meatball) but I've tried many others including their pizza, all tasty and large portions. They also have the fresh deli counter for meats, cheese, etc as well as many other staples for your home-made Italian dishes, check it out, glad I did."}
{"text":"This place has been recommended to us a couple of times. We finally tried it today. Will definitely be back. It is a hidden treasure. We had a simple sausage pizza. The dough was perfect. The sauce amazing. We are coming back to sample other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.

This place is Italian.  It's a cozy deli, store and restaurant all rolled into one.

Family owned by the looks of it.  Very popular.  There are tables and booths.

Ordered a Italian sub, ice-t, and fries.

All very good, and worth visiting again to select from their tasty menu.

Check it out"}
{"text":"MMM this was wicked and delicious. Such an interesting restaurant, being a restaurant/food shop combo. You can get deli meat, pre-made braciole, cannolis, and so many other items to take home, or you can order off their very long and expansive menu. I got a dish that had broccoli, sausage, chicken, all cooked in olive oil. Can't remember its name, but it was amazing. I had a bite of a friend's broasted chicken, and it was cooked to perfection. Huge portions, just like any good Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Not real sure what all the fuss is about their Broasted chicken which is actually fried chicken plus something else,  We got the 4 piece meal to go.  The broasted potatoes were boring fried potatoes.  The cole slaw has garlic it in and actually made me throw up which of course is not a good sign.  The chicken I expected juicy mouth watering juicy, which I did not get. it was dry, dry dry. The chicken is better at Costco and way less expensive.  I had to put apple sauce on my chicken to make it moist.  I would tell Guido to stick to one thing which you do good and avoid all the rest as they also sell very high priced pasta dishes, which I have not tried as they are very high priced even for Scottsdale.  The chicken dinner was also suppose to come with bread and butter and it did not it came with very dried out garlic bread.  If they had been honest and said it comes with garlic bread I would have asked for just bread and butter as I do not like garlic bread."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom what else can I say simply the best place to eat Italian food!!! Love this place and don't miss out on the best chocolate brownies ever!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great hole on the wall.   I adore places like this that have great food, service and a nice atmosphere- it's a little store and restaurant. 

I had one of their great pastas and my wife had the chicken parmigiana. Both were lovely with a nice salad and table bread.   

It's one of those throw back places that serves southern Italian classics.  So don't go expecting something else and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Guido's looks like a classic italian deli to me, and a good one.  Disclaimer:  I am no expert, not being italian or ever frequented an italian neighborhood.  That being said, I sure would like to.  

Meatballz was closed again and we all needed our fix.  Guido's hit the spot with their italian beef sandwich that was cheesey, juicy and on some of the best crusty roll I've had in a while.  On the downside, the beef was pretty tough, so I'll probably have to go back to test it out again.  Spaghetti and meatballs had a well made gravy and meatballs that looked pretty good, and my son said were good, but he wouldn't even let me have a tiny taste.  Never seen him mop up sauce with garlic bread before, but he took it up like a pro.

They sell fresh pasta, pre-made entrees and salads, meats, italian ice and spumoni and the sought out San Marzano tomatoes.  The inventory is presented really well - not a speck of dust to be found on any can or shelf, fresh looking, well stocked and orderly.

Guido's has the potential for five stars if everything tastes as good as it looks.  Looks like a few more visits are in order."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service and food were outstanding! 
Can't wait to return! 
Hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Wow I was just passing through town and this little deli looked like a good place to grab a bite to eat. 

Looks can be deceiving because when i got inside this was basically a full-service restaurant, deli, and then some. 

Food took a while to come out but it was a busy night and I could see that they really cook everything homestyle and to order. It was definitely worth the wait.

I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich which was hot and delicious, the sauce and uality of the food gives me confidence to come back and sample the whole menu."}
{"text":"Enjoyable little place. Great sandwiches, salads, and good selection of Italian groceries."}
{"text":"Second visit to Guido's. Excellent broasted chicken! Actually too much food! Our server Kendra was very personable and very attentive. She's great! Worth the 2.5 hour one-way trip to Guido's!"}
{"text":"I've had Guido's bookmarked forever. It just so happened that I was talking with a friend of mine and Guido's came up. So what do I do, go home get my wife and we're off to Guido's. 

It's an unassuming Italian deli and restaurant. We walk in and not sure what to do cause there's no hostess but one of the servers just tell us to find a table. Cool. They basically have two server handling all the tables inside and outside. 

Took a little while but our server came and brought us our drinks. I ordered the Italian combo which is Italian Beef with homemade sausage and grilled onions and peppers with melted mozzarella. This was really good. They give you a cup of sauce to make it even more moist. The bread is fresh too. So good. The more sauce I put on the more I loved it. So good. My wife want to try my sandwich and she couldn't put it down. She loved it too. 

My wife ordered her usual the meatball sandwich which happens to be one of my favorites too. Huge meatballs with Marinera sauce with melted mozzarella. I knew I could share with her and boy was it good. Meatballs were really good and loved the sauce. My wife was raving about the bun. So fresh and soft. We both really liked it a lot. 

I decided to get a half an order of boasted fries. These were fresh and really good. I know I'm not supposed to eat a lot but so dang good. Not crispy but just right. No complaints here

So this place has an Italian deli with Italian dessert in the freezer too plus a restaurant. Very busy. Very open and reminds me a lot of DeFalco's but less cramped. Very relaxed atmosphere were you can enjoy your Italian meal. The food is spot on. Excellent. The service is pretty good. It's just not one of those place you want to rush to get in and out in a hurry. Enjoy the food. Enjoy the atmosphere. It's really good. 

The question is will I be back. Of course I will. My wife even asked me what days they are open and I know she loves it too. Can't wait to try more. I just love Italian food"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service, Italian food like it's suppose to be made, deli items to purchase, and specialty items any good Italian would appreciate!"}
{"text":"This is the best deli around. For starters, they serve Boars Head. I love this place for lunch and dinner. I would recommend the Minestrone soup,chicken parmesan and fries as they are heavenly!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I had the fried chicken dinner. Although it was very, very dry and I'll probably never get it again, I did see items in the menu that I would love to get my hands on. In the future when I go back (because I do plan to go back) I'll be able to give this spot another review and hopefully I'll be able to bring those stars a bit higher. I probably would have given this place at least 4 stars had my chicken not had the texture of rubber. It was so dried out that I thought I just bit into a piece of chicken jerky. So for now I'll leave my review as it is until I revisit. I will add this, the customer service was great! Our waitress was awesome with a great sense of humor, something I definitely look forward to on my next visit."}
{"text":"Coming from the NJ/NY area I was pretty skeptical about a deli in a strip mall but this place really came through. It reminded me of a pizza place back home that hasn't been updated since the 90s but doesn't matter since the food is on point. I got the italian sandwich, would've liked more meat but it was good. I will definitely become a regular here. 

Oh, and if you complained about the service, did you really expect 5 star service at a deli? Get off your \"foodie\" high horse."}
{"text":"Great customer service, well prepared and incredibly tasty food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab lunch or dinner in Scottsdale. Really cool environment and a cool family ran restaurant. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It's all really good, I've tried it all."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Nice quaint family dining atmosphere. Generous portions of food."}
{"text":"Worst experience! We have been to this restaurant a few times and while we love the food and atmosphere, the lack of customer service and class that the owner/manager showed to us tonight was absolutely inexcusable. After we ordered our food, the waitress told us that their credit card machine was down but that it should be fixed soon. After we ate our meal, we were presented with the check without a word about the machine. We figured it got fixed. When the waitress brought our credit card back to our table she said that the machine was still down. She told us we had to leave the restaurant and find an ATM that we could use, then come back to pay cash. I told her that I really didn't want to have to do that, considering we had a small child with us. I offered to pay by check. She checked with the owner/manager and he said no. She apologized to us and said that she would have taken the check if it were up to her. All of a sudden the owner/manager comes to our table and starts yelling about the situation. He said that he was \"stuck\" and that there was nothing he could do about it. I offered again to pay by check but he told me that there was \"no way\" he could take that. I said \"so you will run the risk of all these people leaving to go get money instead of offering an alternative way to pay, such as a check?\" Then he started blabbering about God or something like that. I also told him that we will get charged a fee to pull out of the nearest ATM, then he said \"well how much can that fee be? Here take a couple bucks off the bill\" I said \"forget it, don't bother\" He was throwing his arms up in the air and he was very loud, which was completely embarrassing to us. This was a Saturday night around 7pm, and it was very crowded. My small child saw that the man was yelling at me so she started crying, saying \"mommy!\" We could have made an even bigger scene since we did nothing wrong and were being treated so poorly, but we chose the high road. Needless to say, we left to find cash and brought it back. We will never return there again and I will be sharing this experience with our friends and family. So disappointing."}
{"text":"An authentic family-run deli experience. The Italian Sausage is out of this world - get it with a side of beef juice to dip it in. This is an Italian grocery store, a meat market, and a deli all in one. Do yourself a favor and give Guido's a try soon. Very casual atmosphere with a few booths if you choose to dine in."}
{"text":"Been coming to Guido's since we moved to Scottsdale in 1997.  Back then there was much more family running the place.  The only 2 people I recognize now are the cook (always the same dude) and Guido.

Of all the reviews I read on Guido's (I didn't read them all, admittedly), I'm shocked more people didn't try the Broasted Chicken.  Not \"fried\" chicken, but a close cousin and absolutely terrific.  Juicy, crispy and darn good.  Comes with 3 huge Broasted potato wedges and cold slaw.  Let's talk about the cold slaw:  BEST in the state.  Has some kind of oniony taste that just knocks it out of the park.  Sounds strange, but sometimes I crave the cold slaw more than the chicken!
 
Wings are solid.  Pizza's OK (I'm from Brooklyn and a huge pizza snob, so nothing in AZ is going to work for me).  Hot Sandwiches are great.  Chicken Parm and Meatball sub are favorites of my teenage sons.  Great selection of beverages.  Interesting beer choices from the help-yourself-refridgerator in the front.

Prices are decent.  Service is spotty, but the kitchen is right in front of you and very open so if things aren't going well, you can walk right up to the cook and tell him.  Also, Guido is always there, so...

Only real disappointment are the frozen \"Italian Ices\" that sit in a freezer near the front of the place.  They are pre-packaged and frozen.  Tempting to look at, but a poor immitation of the real thing. 

If you're headed to the Harkins Shea 14 movie heater or the Big League Dugout for your baseball gear stop in.  With the lack of good Italian places in AZ, this one's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Most people probably come to Guidos for sandwiches, pasta and great meats but I've found their Seafood salad. It is really chock full of shrimp, mussels, squid , crab and crisp lettuce etc. the dressing is great Italian oil n vinegar . This is my choice for a wonderful lunch! It comes with hot seasoned bread too."}
{"text":"I had the italian combo sandwich and it was delicious. Also the French fries were made from fresh potatoes and were great. As for the gentleman who stated they needed more salt, that's what a salt shaker is for. Personally I thought they were perfect. The only negative I can say was the slice of pizza we had was real doughy and not very good. Overall food and atmosphere was very good."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is an really cool old school Italian deli with the kinds of things my grandparents would have just loved- lots of imported groceries, gardineria, sweets and deli meats. 

My absolute favorites are the Italian roast beef (great sub rolls!) and you must get the fresh mozzarella appetizer- half moons of crispy fried mozzarella served with marinara."}
{"text":"Great food almost as good as eating in Rome. Really great eggplant parmigean. Good veal parm, too. Decent bread and a truly acceptable salad. BUT, the service sucked. Forget the slowness, but ignoring? And picking up dirty napkins and silverware and then serving food without washing. That's seriously wrong. Still, good food and large servings make this a place worth revisiting."}
{"text":"Love this spot!  Grew up nearby and never checked it out until I was much older and no longer lived nearby, wish I would have known about it sooner because I've been missing out! Guidos gives you the genuine Italian deli feel you wouldn't expect in AZ and their top notch Italian eats transport you.  Haven't had a chance to try everything on the menu, but what I can say is everything I have had is perfection!  The servings are large and the prices are fair.  Also, don't forget dessert, they have some genuine Spumoni and decadent cannolis that'll have you rolling out the door.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Clean, neat, friendly and GOOD. Definitely a bias toward Chicago style sandwiches, pizza and Italian dishes. Had the Chicago roast beef sandwich with sausage and peppers, and au jus. Au hell - tasty! Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is located along a grocery store strip mall. It's a little hard to find because it's tucked in on the inside corner. That doesn't seem to deter people though. This place has been busy serving customers for the past 28 years. I had no idea they'd been there that long. Geesh, they must be doing something right. 

I've only tried a couple of things. By far, my favorite is their Italian sub. It's a freshly baked submarine roll absolutely stuffed with deli meats (salami and mortadella, pepperoni) and provolone cheese, then lettuce, tomato, onion, with a generous amount of Italian dressing poured over it. I know I should only order the half portion, but sometimes I just gotta go for the whole. Roll up your sleeves and get the napkins ready. You're in for a fantastic, messy, tasty treat."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for takeout after seeing Guidos on Check Please Arizona.  Cute little place.  We placed our order and somehow it never got to the chef/cook.  After waiting at least 45 minutes and several attempts by the manager to resubmit our order, we finally received our order (without any apology).  Customer service not so great!

I ordered the veal parmesan...nothing special, and the same for my husband's Bolognese.  We will not be back.  There are so many great restaurants in Scottsdale that care about their customers."}
{"text":"What kind of place puts up a banner with a special deal and then won't honor it? False advertising at its best. See the photo I posted with the beer and pizza special."}
{"text":"If it were not for yelp I would never have found this place. Tucked away in the back corner of a massive commercial complex its easy to miss; I actually had a hard time locating it. As I approached the front door I was greeted with a hand written note indicating the card machine was down and they were only accepting cash - but that didn't deter me. Came with two buddies and we decided to get a table close to the deli case which allowed for some good people watching and really helped to soak in the ambiance. It has the Italian deli feel to it; you know...the one with friendly people, all kinds of products you can't get at the grocery store, the finest quality cold cuts and cheese, homemade bread, and freezers packed with ice cream and pastas. We all opted for sandwiches; and the full size. Holy smokes were they massive and to be honest us full grown men could have gotten by on half a sandwich each. I chose the meatball marinara as I think it's a good way to judge a place - you get a feel for their sauce and the meat they use. The sauce was just a tiny bit on the sweet side for me but I have to say it's one of the best I have ever had. Meatballs were juicy and of quality ingredients. Both the sauce and meatballs were simply yet super complex in terms of taste. The bread was soft and light on the inside but crispy on the outside - truly a work of art. Topped off with some provolone cheese and a side of sauce for dipping was the finishing touches of a masterpiece. Great people, even better food...what else could you ask for. I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian food made from scratch.  We always enjoy the friendly atmosphere created by the staff.  Love the spaghetti & meatballs!  Be sure to finish your meal with spumoni direct from Italy!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The breasted chicken is the best.  The servers are always friendly.  Makes for an easy dinner during the week."}
{"text":"My hubby met me here for lunch and it was crazy delicious. I've come to this location since 2006 and love everything on the menu. The only reason why I am taking a star away is that it took over 30 minutes just for us to get our lunch. My hubby ordered a calzone and I did the shrimp and marinara appetizer. I felt so bad that he had to quickly rush out the moment his lunch arrived and did not have time to sit down and enjoy it. Aside from the long wait, their food is truly delicious. We will be giving this spot one quick try for lunch again."}
{"text":"Wow !!!  What a joke.  We ordered for the first time from this place based on Yelp reviews...Never again.  The food looks great, but they didn't give us anything to eat it with.  When I called, the guy hardly spoke English and told me you have to pay extra for forks.  Are you serious ????  What horrible service."}
{"text":"Picked up sandwiches from Guido's Deli one night. Although I wasn't with my husband when he picked up the order, he commented on how good the service was. I had the Italian Sub with Capocollo, Mortadella and Salami. It was a good sandwich...huge and loaded with meat! I couldn't finish it. Everyone in our group enjoyed their sandwich as well, but they were so big that we all ended up having leftovers for lunch the following day. We also ordered cannolis and although they were small, they were awesome!! Sweet, but not too sweet, with a delicious filling and mini chocolate chips. I love cannolis!"}
{"text":"Okay place. Was better back in the day. Itallian deli, store restaurant. Food was descent... service and friendliness not so great. Expensive for mediocre service. They were better back in the day when cared about being the best at food and friendly  service..not so much now...sad, not a go to place anymore."}
{"text":"Worst service ever over a half an hour to even order. If you come here get it to go! The food itself is good but they always seem to mess up our orders I really cant give more than 3 stars. Also wish their meatballs were all beef, but their sauce and sandwiches are amazing."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing!  Guido makes the world's best sandwich. They are all great but ask for a lemon pepper chicken with hot peppers."}
{"text":"We have had really good luck here....Scottsdale is awash with this sort of fare, mostly boring, but this one works..... not really cheap but we feel the food is well worth it.  the owner is   very experienced and has a really super crew in the kitchen.....I don't think your going to do any better around here or for that matter pretty much anywhere else....He really watches the quality....give it a shot!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I first saw this place I actually called my boyfriend to ask: \"Is this it?!\" For a strip mall restaurant that doesn't look like much from the outside this place is surprisingly delightful on the inside. The walls are covered with fun decor and newspaper articles while any available surface space offers baked goods, t-shirts, cookies, and snacks. The best part about this place was the server. Robbie was no doubt the most pleasant server I've had in YEARS and I eat out all the time. He accommodated several special requests and was friendly & funny without being over-the-top or annoying. He didn't even seem irritated when my boyfriend and I started spatting across the table. Seriously Robbie, I would open a restaurant myself just to hire you. I guess I should also mention that the food was great! I will definitely be back the next time my boyfriend and I feel like fighting over some good food."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner and will NEVER  go back! The owner is rude. His computer system was down tonight and made this everyones problem but his own. He told his customers to go to a bank/atm and then come back and pay their bill. I don't have an atm card, so now what??  He was loud and overbearing to customers. His loss, will not return.."}
{"text":"Great family owned place to eat AND take out -  try the meatballs. They are heavenly!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. Dine in or get take out. Always consistent. We love this place. There are also healthy options."}
{"text":"This place is a great authentic Chicago style deli but also serves hot pastas as well as many other treats. Has been here for a very long time and if you go in you will find out why."}
{"text":"Outstanding neighborhood deli and dining. Friendly and attentive service with great food priced right. Try it and you'll add it to your list of favorites."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time with great prices!  I had the calamari and Howie's Pastrami Sandwich.  Both were incredible! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Introduced our family to Guidos last night for my husbands birthday. We've been to Guidos MANY times and have noticed the last several times we have not been happy with the food and especially the service. Each time we've gone there are new servers which explains, but certainly doesn't not excuse,  the bad service. My husband had the veal piccata which he said was burned and not tender, and the pasta side was not cooked and the sauce was bland. My daughter had the linguine with shrimp and was disappointed the shrimp was not grilled, but deep fried (this should be noted in the description). Sadly we will probably not waste our time driving an hour for this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Guido's.  the pasta was homemade, the prices reasonable, and the food very flavorful.  All of this in a deli market setting.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"If you love mayonnaise, this is your kind of place.  Ordered the chicken salad sandwich to-go, first of all, they didn't ask what size I wanted and they gave me a foot-long (way too big), then, there was so much mayonnaise on it that it was inedible.  So, $14 for a sandwich that I couldn't choke down. Besides the mayonnaise, not much flavor.  Never going back! Prices for sandwiches are ridiculous."}
