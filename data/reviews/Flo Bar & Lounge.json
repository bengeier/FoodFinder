{"text":"Check out Flo Bar and Lounge Saturday night.. A major disappointment! Roaches crawling on the wall and when this was brought to someone's attention it was not a major concern. Waitresses paid no attention to some of the patrons and charging an admission is ridiculous since your kitchen closes at 10.. Maybe post on the outside that kitchen is closed!"}
{"text":"Nice inside, decent food. However, the karoake contest is rigged. They ask you to bring friends to cheer you on. They say the person with the loudest cheer wins. That is a flat out lie! They only want your friends there to purchase food. The person with the loudest cheer & that sung the best didn't even win. The hostess asked them to do a sing off. Then she still didn't pick the winner. She let the wait staff pick. She didn't give it to the person they picked. She gave it to the person that that didn't even sing the best. That person had the least amount of cheers. I figured it was her friend. I left there in disgust. People were saying the person that sung the best & had the loudest cheer didn't even win. There is no need to lie to get people to come to your establishment. If you are good people will come. I will not spend ANY more of my dollars there!"}
{"text":"Came in during my lunch hour today. Out of the entire restaurant, there was a party of 4 at one table and 2 other ladies sitting at the bar eating. We places our order within about 5 mins of arrival and it literally took an entire hour to get our food. As a result, lunch was boxed to go and had to come back to work. Some adjustments definitely need to be made in order to cater to a lunch crowd, especially for those who have to get back to work within the hour. And on top of that the restaurant was basically empty. Food was good though and will more than likely give them another shot."}
{"text":"The music is great and the night I went it was all R&B. The drinks were ok. Nothing special. The atmosphere is the best thing about Flo. I was not a fanatic concerning the food. The fries were extremely hard and salty, the wings were flavorless, small and salty...The spinach crab dip was watery. I will not come back to eat but I will come back to listen to good music and have hookah. Btw hookah is free on Thursdays :)"}
{"text":"Never leave reviews but... I've been 4 separate times 3 of these times with friends from out of town trying to show them a good time and not having to leave the university area. I was a server 4 years while in college so I understand if your busy you try your best to appease everybody but all 4 times I have had to wait for my drinks and over an hour for chicken and waffles, which was cold by the way. I couldn't do nothing but SMH and laugh. Which was the last time I order food for there although my 3rd visit the kitchen manager made up for it by giving me a free order of the shrimp and grits (didn't eat because it has pork in it) my friend lick the bowl dry. He said it was REALLY good but there again when she left us we still had to wait for our drinks.
 That's not what made me write this review it's the staff. The people can make or break a business such as this it's black owned and run so I want it to do well so please get it together."}
{"text":"Went to Flo last night for the Duke vs UNC game and the Garcia vs Thurman fight. It was by far the most fun I've had in a long time. The DJ kept the energy up during commercials and the food and service was amazing. This is exactly the vibe Charlotte needed. If you go try the lemon pepper hot Wings."}
{"text":"First time going on a Wednesday got the poetry night. No cover charge (always a plus in my book) the crowd was grown and sexy. The poetry had a  sexual theme (wasn't expected but enjoyed it). The drinks were good. They had $4-$6 drink specials. The hookah was $25. I was really moved by how community focused the owner was after he took the mic (that alone makes me want to return). I enjoyed myself and circulated dollars with us. WIN/WIN."}
{"text":"Comedy Night Review:

My friends and I visited flo bar for Comedy night on a Tuesday. There was a $5 dollar cover at the door. We arrived around 7:30pm and sat ourselves. I give props to flo bar for the colorful and well done paintings of hip hop moguls lining the walls and for the black and white bathroom murals that decorate the stalls in the women's restroom. It's different. We were Seated for about 10 minutes before being addressed by our server. The Light up drink menu was a first for me, a feature that sets them apart from other establishments in Charlotte. Our Waitress was personable but wasn't very knowledgeable about the drink menu. Her reason being that she wasn't of age, so she made recommendations based on what most people order.  That's a good move. Most Speciality drinks are made with d'usse cognac. None of the drinks appealed to me so I bypassed ordering a drink. The menu consisted of standard sports bar offerings...wings, burgers, sandwiches, a few salads and a few standard entrees. I was surprised to find that sides are a separate cost meaning that even if you order a burger, fries have to be ordered separately. The price of the burger did not reflect this extra cost. I ordered the lemon  pepper wings, flavorful but small in size. For my side I went with the Sprouts and Sparagus, a sautéed medley of asparagus, sprouts, mushrooms, onion, and bacon. It was well seasoned and filling. I'd definitely order it again. My friends seemed to be satisfied with their food choices. One ordered the sweet potato fries, they were pretty tasty. Just a heads up, a limited menu is offered after 9pm. 

They definitely have room for growth, especially in the area of staff training, service and menu development. I hear they offer brunch on the weekend. I may check it out again in few months."}
{"text":"First off, decor is good. They have great potential but could use some serious mentorship from a successful bar owner. I had the Cajun shrimp pasta which was absolutely delicious. My friend had \"rib eye\", Mac n cheese & collards. The rib eye looked like another part of the animal. Very unapealling but he said it was good. The collards tasted canned & the Mac n cheese was by far the saltiest food I've ever eaten. They must have used a salt grinder bc the salt actually crunched in my mouth. The men's restroom smelled like salmon--I was too chicken shit to try the women's. It was noticeably empty for happy hour time on a Friday night in the University area. Management spoke with us but offered no concession. The staff is nice but not polished at all. I understand you get what you get at a certain wage but training is a big issue. One bartender sprayed cleaning spray on the counter while a patron was eating. The in at one point the music was so loud we just started laughing. It was unreal. However, our waitress did turn it down to a nice \"happy hour\" volume, not \"club mez.\" If I had not experienced this directly & read this post, I'd be like ummmm, hmph. But it happened to me soooo, yeah. And the tab was like $100+. I won't be back. As I stated initially, GREAT idea. Wrong execution."}
{"text":"I decided to give it a try despite the negative reviews. The establishment is nice and has a lot of potential. As stated in previous reviews the service is very slow. I ordered the Henson it was a little over cooked but yet flavorful. Our server Jahniece was attentive and nice she offered suggestions when she provided our menus which was greatly appreciated. If all servers are like her I foresee this being a gem in the city. Like all new establishments it will take some time. Lastly I appreciate that the ambiance is out of the box and trendy. I will be back and hoping to update this to 5stars."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here for brunch this morning until I got here. To start it off, the host told me there would be a 40 minute wait. When we got to the bar, there were multiple open tables. A waitress then told us we could sit at one but there would be a wait on food. We noticed there was a party in a separate room which took all of the servers attention. We waited over an hour just to place an order and to top it off, our mimosas were served in tiny plastic cups because they said the dishwasher broke. It's now 3:15pm, we are still waiting on our second mimosas (they ran out of orange juice) & just out our order in after we got here at 2pm. I am beyond furious & wont be back."}
{"text":"First I have to give credit to the ambiance of Flo. The inside is very nice however, the service was trash. Went there for brunch, took us 90 minutes to get our food. Then, my order was chicken and waffles looked like they cut 2 leggo my eggos up into 4 pieces and microwaved 2 small pieces of chicken. The shit was terrible. Service for our drinks took forever. Was an overall bad experience. Practice patience when you go! Trash spot."}
{"text":"I visited a week ago on a Thursday night and was impressed with the food,  the atmosphere, and the overall ambiance.   So much so,  I planned a birthday outing for a friend for tonight to attend the advertised Taco Tuesday.   Prior to tonight,  I called the listed number for bottle service only to have the gentleman have a screaming baby in the background tell me that he wasn't the right person and he'd text me the number to the right person when we hung up.   Still waiting on that text.   Just saw an HOUR ago, that they are advertising revised hours of operation that do not include Tuesday.   As I scurry to confirm,  NO ONE will call me back,  text me,  or respond to FB messages.   I must say that I'm very disappointed in their lack of professionalism.   If you're going to revise operational hours,  at least give more than an hours notice.   They definitely need better business management."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a 3 Star only because the food is good and the waitress was awesome but this establishment puts the false in false advertising. Attached is the flyer put out by the owner, along with the nights supposed drink special. The hookah was only free for the first 15 served and they offered me 1s as change for 100.00 bill. 

The owner was responsive to my concerns, they offered 1 drink on their menu for 3.00 and I was given a full refund. At the end of the day I just wish people would deliver as they advertise. I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"The waitress, Jahniece was very nice, and pleasant. However, I don't know what was going on in the kitchen. The staff is slow!!!!  We arrived at 11:00am when the doors open. The doors did not actually open until AFTER 11. We ordered our food at noon, and did not get it until 1:00pm. The cook did not cook my side order of ham because she wasn't sure if I wanted it. I ordered it didn't I?  My meal came with potatoes, but, I had to send for them. My pancakes were hard and cold as if they pulled them from the buffet. I'm not sure if I'd return here to eat. Besides all that, the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is suuupppeerrrr slow. So if you have time, go for it. They have really cute bottle service, confetti and hello kitty themed (the time I went). Music was good and we had a good time."}
{"text":"New hot spot for Wed night poetry and good food. The doors open at 7:00p and show starts round 8. Crowd is hype and engaged. Slam fans this spots for you!"}
{"text":"I'm at Flo bat and lounge right now. I've been waiting for a drink since 12:24...and I'm still waiting. Come him after hours if you're cool with standing all night, it taking 45minutes to get a drink. If you aren't getting table service  stay at home."}
{"text":"I went today with a group. I called ahead to ensure seating. We got there and it was a nice space. We had our own area. It's definitely a lounge setting which was fine. Our server was very friendly. 
We didn't all arrive at the same time but it took awhile just to get all our drinks. One person never got hers. She took our order which went okay. Didn't pay much attention to time due to conversation going on. Then one by one the meals started appearing. Although I was one of the last to order my was one of the first out. The food arrived over about 20 minutes. Those of us who got ours first eventually started eating. 
My portion of the shrimp and grits I ordered was really small. I thought it may have been just their portion size until my girl who ordered the same thing had twice as much. It didn't make sense since we were paying the same amount. I had sweet tea which was okay. I definitely left hungry however. 
The staff was nice, atmosphere relaxing, food was just okay, portions not desirable. I would probably return for a special event without the food order."}
{"text":"Nice ambience & decor. I've been to Flo twice. First was on a Saturday night, someone my friend knew bought a section. The setup was different... They rope their sections off so you have to either crawl under or unlatch/latch the rope and then walk through another section if you have to leave out. Also the confetti they bust for bottle service makes the floor really slippery (no fun if you have on heels) and my friend went to the bar to buy a drink and said she waited like 20 mins to be attended to. I've also went for comedy Tuesday. Everyone was raving about the wings when I was last there so I had to try them out. I ordered that and the sautéed spinach. My friend got the shrimp and grits (also an appetizer) it took over an hour for both of them to come out. Food was decent but wings were very small, so portion size is small for the price you're paying. They're new and definitely still have kinks to work out but I'd still go back, just not on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"I came here some weeks ago to celebrate a friends birthday I didn't know what to expect but I did have a enjoyable time Idk if I will be back though simply because it's far from where I live"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night expecting for it to be a nice chill spot with a friend. Security and the door girl were extremely nice ( They get the two stars!) but once I walked in the place reeked of weed, which was odd because there were at least 5 officers outside, anyway, it stunk bad. Looks very nice inside but the way the seating and lighting makes it awkward when walking in because everyone at a table is positioned to stare you down as you enter. The music was extremely loud, it stunk, we waited 15 min at the bar for a drink then finally decided to just leave. I wouldn't recommended this place to others."}
{"text":"I've given this place three tries.. once a month for the past three months. 

1st visit- waited 20 MINUTES for a waitress to come to our table to greet us because they all were in a \"meeting\". Another 45 minutes waiting on the food and another 10 minutes for the waitress to finally bring us silverware. Service awful, food was good. I ordered a chicken philly and spin dip.

2nd visit- service was better, food was terrible, sent back for being burnt, came back out burnt again... how difficult is it to fry French fries? 

3rd/final visit- 45 minutes to get a mimosa at brunch time... wasn't crowded at all. Left to go eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"With little to no people in the establishment,  it took over 45 minutes to feed a table of 5. Multiple dishes were burnt. The staff seemed to spend more time socializing than tending to the guests needs. They did not have salt and pepper shakers, instead small packets that belonged in to-go silverware. 

It is a nice atmosphere and the music is nice. Do not go if you want to have a good service experience."}
{"text":"Started off with a limited, small menu of breakfast foods with no sides or a $20 buffet. Ordered Mimosas and the champagne glasses had residues of lipstick left on them. This establishment needs better organization, help the overall development of business."}
{"text":"There are few places for brunch in the University area. We didn't want to go Uptown so figured we would give this place a shot...

One star is for our waitress because she was very pleasant. However, even her niceness couldn't overshadow our experience. 

We got seated quickly.  The seats aren't the most comfortable. First thing I notice is the $9 cost of a regular mimosa. Nothing special. 25 for the bottle. Still, nothing special. No different juice options, nothing. We ordered maybe 10 minutes after we sat down and had a chance to look at the menu. It took over 45 mins to get our food. And the place didn't seem THAT busy. I'm not sure what goes on back there in the kitchen but it is extremely slow. People were constantly walking around asking us how everything was, which was fine, but we didn't have anything to pass our answers off of other than the water we had. Another person asked us how our service was. She was good. Very friendly, and the things we were unhappy about really had nothing to do with her. After getting our meal it was pretty good, but I wouldn't have waited almost an hour for it. My sister got the same thing as someone else at a nearby table and oddly enough there plates  looked nothing a like.  

After eating we asked for our checks....unfortunately for us, their server went down so we had to again wait so we could even leave! BTW there was a table that had ordered their food before we had even got ours and theirs still hadn't come out by the time we left. It was a mess. We finally get our checks and my sister just gives the waitress her card Bc we didn't want to have to wait any longer. Afterwards she realized she got charged 8.49 a side of two eggs!"}
{"text":"Poor poor service, please work on training your staff. Went for a birthday dinner (that was reserved in advance). Got there no table was ready due to miscommunication between staff members, we Waited a while before being seated. Servers are really slowwwww. Not sure if they are ready for huge crowds. Wasn't able to order of the full menu they advised they stop at 10pm but it was 9:30pm (hmmmm). Anyhow we ordered off late night menu the wings are good. There was some confusion of whether or not what the server gave us was ranch or blue cheese. She immediately picks the cup with the ranch in it and puts it to her nose to smell it!! Who puts someone's food to their nose??? She was offended when I asked for another cup of ranch since she has put the others to her nose. I bought my friend a birthday cake they destroyed it while it was in the back. Owner was gracious enough to reimburse me for the cake even though I really wanted my friend to try it and enjoy it. Doesn't seem to be a dress code..it seemed relaxed. The DJ was great. But the service was terrible it took to long for servers to check on you. I could go on about some other weird things that happened but I will refrain. I will try to go in the day time maybe."}
{"text":"I went to flow on 3/4/17 for brunch at 11:30 am. We were the first table of the day. We were greeted in a lively way and seated immediately of course. The waitress was very lovely of course and very knowledgeable. I had the movie time drink with dusse. It was very tasty. I ordered the buffet all items on the Buffett were really good. My two favorite items were the potatoes and the bacon. The grits were different (the chef said they were stone ground grits cooked with cream and chicken broth)but very good. Since it was so laid back the general manager Kenny gave us a round of drinks on him and he was a real cutie too. Sporteodie was there and we took pics with him. The chef came and talked to us about the Buffet items. They played the Erykah Badu Mamas gun album which I was really vibing to. This was an all around great experience I think I will drop in for the comedy night on Tuesday's. I rather enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"I came for brunch and was pleasantly surprised. They offer an array of pancake creations that all the foodies will enjoy! I chose the cinnamon swirl pancake. This is served in a small cast iron skillet complete with Crispy edges! So yum! I ordered a side of eggs to complete this. Mimosas are tasty but a bit overpriced. The ambiance is great and parking is free. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place , the owner and the staff are awesome ! The shrimp and grits are amazing"}
{"text":"It's the grand opening. The line is outrageous and they are letting people in every 20 minutes. I offered to pay more to skip the line. We are women, it's cold. But the door man wouldn't let us in even though the people in front of us were getting in for $40. They are probably racist. Fuck em. The women behind us got in after they told us we couldn't PAY EXTRA to skip the line. Bye sportie Odie continue screaming on commercials"}
{"text":"We were visiting from the DMV & our sister brought us to Flo Bar & Lounge to show us one of Charlotte's popular hip hop party spots. Since it was a 25 degree night, the line to get in wasn't extremely long but there were more people in line than I anticipated for that weather. Security did a pat down and bag check before we were able to enter and once we got in, there was a $20 cover charge. 

Inside, there were a few VIP sections with tufted benches and seats, a few cocktail tables where people were doing hookahs, and a full bar with club priced drinks. Bottle service girls were moving throughout the crowd and the DJ played all the current hip hop music. This spot gave me more of a club feel than Lounge feel on Saturday night and would be a great place to come celebrate a birthday or good stop on a bachelorette party night. The crowd appeared to be primarily African American people in their twenties to early thirties."}
