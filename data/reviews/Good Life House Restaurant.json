{"text":"THIS GAVE ME AND MY FAMILY FOOD POISONING!!!!   On October 12th 2014, me and my mother ordered vegetable stir fried rice, shrimp noodles, and beef noodles to go. They went in the back room and it seemed like they didn't even cook it because they had it ready super fast. We took it home and ate half of it. The next morning we were sick with diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting. We did not realize that it was due to Good Life House`s food because we were both at our separate jobs and did not know that we both experienced sickness.   We both ate more of their food when we got home and our sickness got a lot worse.     The food does not even taste good. But moreover it made us both very sick with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING! It's the best Chinese I've had period. You may not want to eat in, because the ambiance isn't exactly the best, but take-out, delivery, whatever, this is it. Also - the price is incredible - they have a list a mile long of $3.99 daily lunch specials that you can buy from 11-4pm. Check it out for sure!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: There is something so fabulously kitschy about big red lanterns that they make me want to eat at any old restaurant that proudly hangs them.  I'm really glad that the aesthetics got us in the door since the food wasn't bad at all - by dodgy Canadian Chinese chop suey restaurant standards. The lunch specials hover around the mind-blowing $4.50 mark and are sided with very decent soy sauce-douced fried rice. My veggie friend went with a saut√©ed melange of Asian veggies while I opted for heavily battered, but surprisingly juicy deep fried chicken wings. Our pot of jasmine tea was refilled about 5 times (each with a big smile) over our lengthy catch up meal.   Good Life House is owned by a family. The server/bike delivery person dad challenges his son to plastic sword fights during down time while the television entertains him when the adults are busy. An older woman does the cooking in the back, delivers dishes to the tables, and assembles great foam box towers of take-out for hungry neighbourhood regulars.  This is no hidden gem that everyone should immediately flock to, but if you're in Parkdale and want a quick, filling sit-down meal with great service and no line up for pocket change, this is it."}
