{"text":"I've only had BBQ in Calgary once but it exceeded my expectations. The beef brisket and pull pork was so tender and flavourful. You can taste and smell the smokiness of the meat.  The sauce and the coleslaw was justices flavorful as the rest. The sauce was smokey and delicious. The coleslaw could use a little more sauce that asside it was fresh and went really well with the pull pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Made my first visit to Big T's in Queensland / Deer Run since taking over from Woody's BBQ. I have been to the location near McMahon Stadium where I was soundly defeated by the Gut Buster (which was featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\").  The new location is bright and open with a nice bar in the centre of the room. There is a good selection of seating from booths to hightops to regular tables. We were greeted by a friendly hostess / server. We took our time reviewing the menu and selected deep fried pickles for an appie to accompany the Wild Rose Wraspberry and Velvet Fog beverage selection.  The menu offers a lot of choices, so making a decision took some time! Our foursome ordered as follows :  salad with a smoked and sauced chicken breast, a pair of two meat plates and a chili dog which was actually an andouille sausage.  The orders came out - there was easily enough food to feed 6 to 8! The ribs and brisket and ribs and pulled pork plates were excellent! Dirty rice was very tasty while the hush puppies were nearest to Heaven I have been in awhile! The massive salad was nicely trimmed with flavourful bits including cheese, tortilla chips and veggies along with a delicious blackberry vinegarette. Lastly, the Chili Cheese Dog was served on a toasted hoagie bun with all the trimmings. The spicy flavour and chili combined to make an excellent meal! Now, you may wonder how do I know how all this great food tasted? Let's just say there was more sampling going on than at a David Guetta concert! (If he does concerts)  If you enjoy bbq, then you need to try out Big T's! This is a great spot in the south of Calgary!!  I should add that the owner stopped by our table for a chat - a nice touch always!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I did. We came for dinner and arrived at 5 pm so the place was still fairly quiet. I had the St Louis ribs, and the other 2 in my party had the beef ribs and the chilli cheese dog. I've had ribs a million times but never have I had as many small fragments of bones. The way they were cut was also weird (likely why I had fragments) and so about half the meat on my slab was just not edible. For a $22 rack that's frustrating. The beef ribs were apparently good, but it's a huge meal so only order if you are hungry. The chilli cheese dog was really spicy and the chilli looked more liquified rather than having any kind of recognizable beans in it. Waitress only supplied 1 sharp knife between two people with ribs. Then when we asked for another she gave it to the person with the hot dog?? Pops tasted watered down and a bit flat, and were also quite small for the $3.50 price tag. There were a couple flies buzzing around which was irritating and a bit gross. Overall the service was okay but not great, 2 of the 3 meals were \"odd\" at best and rather ho hum. The third meal was quite good, but I'm not sure we'd return based on that alone. Plenty of places in the city do ribs. I'd really hoped this would be a winner given it's a BBQ place and you'd think ribs would be a slam dunk, and maybe on other days it would be better. However, I doubt I'd come back when there are so many other excellent options out there."}
{"text":"I have been to big ts before in the nw and today was my first time at this south location. The only reason I am rating THIS location 2 stars is overall experience. While we didn't have to wait long for our food (we got a platter), the food came out cold so it was not enjoyable. Our waitress was not genuine at all. The only reason why she was okay at her job today was cuz her boss was there. Personally I think she needs a new job. She had a bit of attitude when we said we weren't gonna take the rest of the food home (cuz it was gross). I would not recommend this location but the one in the NW always has delicious BBQ and genuine service. Sorry but if you don't have customer service you shouldn't be working in the industry. 2 stars for the shitty experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic Bbq. Had St. Louis ribs. I just gently pulled the bones from the side and was left with an awesome tender meat slab. Try the mustard and hot sauces together. Spicy slaw and fried green tomatoes were terrific too. Nice decor, friendly helpful staff. From the outside I wasn't expecting anything great but there is passion in the food here, you can taste it."}
{"text":"Went to Big T's off of Crowchild a few years ago. Worst bbq we have ever had. Tasted like leftovers. Never went back. Recently saw their bbq truck behind their restaurant at Deer Run. Gave it a try. Very good fresh bbq. Would recommend coming to this location. I don't know how the other location is now, I personally won't go there. Lots of food!"}
{"text":"I had the 3 meat dish it was not to bad the brisket was very dry the rib tips were dry as well I expected more from this place"}
{"text":"This was some of the best BBQ I have had in quite a while. My husband and I chose the \"Priscilla Platter\" which contained a selection of pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs, and chicken. Along with the BBQ were two generous helpings of corn bread, baked beans, and cole slaw. We chose the marinated cole slaw and it was mouth wateringly delicious. Although the platter was for two, you could get away with adding a third person. The meal was served with a selection of sauces you could use to enhance the already spectacular flavors of the meal. My husband and I were so full, we did not have room for dessert but if it tasted as good as it looked going past our table, you are in for a treat. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like BBQ then you need to check them out. Everything on the menu is really good. I liked the deep fried pickles !!  The Mississippi Mud beer goes perfectly with the smoked BBQ.   I will definitely go back another time."}
{"text":"Go to the North end location by the stadium and not this location.  They grill the meat in a truck out back and must do it early in the day as the meat did not taste like it had just been grilled and the meat was just warm, with the meatloaf cold. The smashed potatoes were cold as well.  Was excited to learn of a location close to where we were staying however was overall very disappointed in every part of meal. Service was not great either. Will not go to this location again."}
{"text":"A solid BBQ experience.  I will confess that I love BBQ, and have tried it in Texas and Tennessee.  Rendezvous ribs in Memphis are my favourites, but back to Big T's.  I have been to both Calgary locations, which are quite similar.  The Deer Ridge location is a refurbished Pizza Hut that is well done.  A nice selection of blues played during lunch.  Between the two locations I have tried a number of plates.  The St. Louis ribs and the brisket were quite good, but not great - necessary for the 5th star.  The dirty rice and beans were also quite good, and well fit with the meat.  Some may find meals here expensive compared to fast food, but the quality and portions warrant the difference.    If you want some BBQ in Calgary then Big T is your place."}
{"text":"Overall the food was great and the service was good - attentive and professional. If meat is your thing then you will do very well here! If not, then they have some delicious and unique alternatives. The cornbread was very good. Their sauces are yummy - they understand flavour. What thrilled me to bits were the fried green tomatoes. I had always wanted to try them! Wow... they surpassed my expectations, so delicious - tangy, crunchy and haunting; I want more! Big T's is not cheap, but the type of food they offer tends to be pricier. It will be a once-in-a-while treat."}
{"text":"After a while , I came back here to treat my hubby for a belated Happy Father's Day, we were made to wait a few minutes since there's only 2 of them working but not a lot of crowd, maybe 3-5 tables full and 1 out the patio, upon sitting , the waiter came to ask for any drinks to start, then we proceeded to order, hubby ordered the burrito (OMG) with fried tomato ( he said those were good), while I ordered dry rub baby ribs with salad and fries. Sadly, my salad looked old, and it did taste old. It looked like it sat outside the chiller for a day before it's plated, and the only cold one is the dressing. The taste confirmed it too. Dry rub baby ribs was a little dry and not as moist as the saucy once. I noticed the half rack looked smaller than the last time I ordered it too, the fries looked like it was cooked in old oil, it turned out a shade of Brown and burnt , and tasted like a cardboard box. My toddler who used to love the fries there didn't even eat more  than one. I was pretty upset since I loved the food and service the last time we were in. And it's not cheap, thus, to my extreme disappointment. The Waiter  just passed by once to ask whether all is good, and that's about it. Didn't even bother checking  if I need a refill on my iced tea or ask if hubby needs another beer after. I guess theyre quite busy but with the \"cold\" atmosphere apart from the blah food, I don't think we're ever coming back.."}
{"text":"Yum! So good! Really great, honest flavour. There are so many options of meat and sides, you could never get bored of eating here!"}
{"text":"I love big Ts BBQ. The original location is a little bit better than this location, however the parking at this location is much better, so I generally come to this one. The food is amazing! I've never had a meal there I didn't absolutely love. I brought a good friend of mine here from the southern states where BBQ is big, and he loved it. He said \"the spiciest food I've had ever in alberta!\" And he bought a bottle of sauce to take home. I'm not as huge a fan of spicy, but I love their sauces and their food.  I love it here! Almost always get the brisket sandwich, but I love their Burgoo soup aswell, it's spicy but not too spicy. So flavourful!"}
{"text":"We got the big platter. Everything was soooooo dry.  Had to douse it in BBQ sauce to make it edible. These people need to go to Texas to learn how to BBQ."}
{"text":"I found out about this glorious place almost 2 years ago, and have been going to it about 3-4 times a month. My favorite thing to order would have to be the  big daddy beef brisket with spicy coleslaw and jack cheese.  Not only is the food great, but the staff running it at the farmers market is spot on when it comes to customer service. keep it up Andrew and crew at the market!"}
{"text":"Brunch is where it's at. The eggs benny over brisket is so good that I cried. I believe in true love because of big t's."}
{"text":"Our first time at Big T's was for brunch. We walked into a well kept restaurant and greeting by a friendly waitresses who seated us promptly and immediately took our drink orders. We had many questions about the menu, since we have never been, and they were all answered to a \"T\" ! The server also provided a recommendation which is always helpful. I had the breakfast hash with over easy eggs. My eggs came out very well done so I could not let the yolk ooze out over my hash which was a little disappointing. Im not one to complain or send food back so I ate it anyway and still managed to be satisfied. The overall sweet flavour of the dish (im assuming it was the brisket) was different than what I typically enjoy for my brunch palate, however I still enjoyed it! Kudos! My wife had the bacon and eggs and they were delicious! Smoked bacon! Need I say more!? Both kids meals were satisfying and my son's over easy egg was done PERFECT! I was definitely jealous. Cornbread was a little dry on this day but still edible. A few faux pas but overall a satisfying and very filling meal and our server, attentive and accomodating. We will be back and do recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves it. Lots of fun bbq stuff to choose from. My bf would give it a 5, it's just very specific to a certain genre of people."}
{"text":"M'eh.   We have only tried one other Bbq place in Calgary and Big T's was not as good. My husband and I ordered sandwiches - myself a chicken and my husband a brisket.   The smoky flavor in my chicken was negligible and the meat was rather dry so it was a good thing that they brought a couple of extra bottles of sauces to the table so I could moisten it up.  You have the choice of one side with your sandwich - some of which are free and some of which have an up-charge. I ordered the side greens which was nothing more than a handful of semi-wilted bag salad put on the plate with a couple of grape tomatoes and a couple of slices of cucumber. It was nothing special and definitely not worth ordering.   My husband ordered a brisket sandwich with hushpuppies as his side. He seemed to enjoy his food much more than I enjoyed mine. He said that the brisket was moist and had a nice flavour.   The environment was pleasant and our server fairly attentive but at the end of the day the food was just m'eh and there are better options in town."}
{"text":"Big T's stands for Tasty! Super tasty BBQ food. We've been back several times for birthdays and family gatherings in the past 4 months.   Lots of gluten free items on the menu, except the lunch menu.  MmmmmmmmMeat. Meat Meat Meat and more Meat! Last time I visited, I actually ordered too much food so I would have leftovers to take home to my other half. The ribs & half smoked chicken dinner did just the thing. We ate TWO more meals from that portion.   I'm not a fan of the coleslaw, but my sister is. They also like the cornbread, but it's not glutenfree. (It's CORNbread... but no, not glutenfree)  Burgoo soup is glutenfree & super tasty.  You want to feed an army? Order the Elvis platter. No, this isn't a love boat for two - you better bring a horde to help you, or containers to shlep it home.   No, it's not \"cheap\". You *do* get what you pay for.  Bring the moolah, but bring an appetite too.  *urp* I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight for dinner.  Wonderful place, nice, clean well lit. The food... Amazing.  We had some ribs, meatloaf and brisket sandwich.  Great flavour, good value and wonderful service staff.  Finally a great BBQ spot in Calgary... And it's in the south!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. We live closeby and the smell draws us in often. The manager is friendly but not too friendly and makes you feel welcome. The food is outrageously delicious and the atmosphere is nice and casual. I recommend the Priscilla Platter for a great couple meal to share! The leftovers are always amazing as well."}
{"text":"This place is a very gritty BBQ place. They stick true to their word of ribs being the word of the day and BBQ sauce being the source to the promise land!  With that being said, the chicken wasn't that well prepared considering we were the only ones in the restaurant and the staff had all the time in the world. The sides were average at best and the cornbread was dry. I'm not picky but I want you to have the best experience here.   Overall, the service was great and you should check it out!"}
{"text":"We had ribs and pulled pork and it was delicious. If this is the style of food you are looking for, this is the place to be. Big portions. We went here after a day out biking and it was an excellent choice for a big and enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"The food was over cooked and expensive, especially the chicken. The flavours were nothing special and the fries were soggy. The kid's mac and cheese was slimy and lacked any flavour as well. The corn bread was okay, but how hard is that?"}
{"text":"Oh how I love Big T's. Most amazing potato salad I've ever had, greatest sauces, and juiciest ribs. I've tried as much as I've been able to from the menu and I've never been disappointed. OK, the spicy coleslaw wasn't my favourite, but it was still good. The ambiance of the place is chill and fun, and the servers are friendly and really good at what they do. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is authentic Southern: from pulled pork, to real brewed Ice Tea.  Love the hush puppies too!  Only thing missing on the menu is peach cobbler for dessert.  The food is delicious and the meal portions are generous."}
{"text":"This place is just all around awesome. The owner, Jean, is almost always there and will engage you at your table, and remember your name. I think that says a huge amount about the culture of this business, and it shows in the manner of the happy, friendly staff and overall great atmosphere. My only problem is I'm the only adult that likes smoked meat in our family. What the hell is wrong with people you don't like smoked meat?!?!? Oh well, if you like smoked meat, the menu items here are really, really good. And portions are very decent. Prices are perfectly fine. I would eat here much more often if there were more substantial choices for non-smokers in the family.... Thanks Jean for having this business in my neighborhood. Truly happy to recommend it."}
{"text":"I would love to review the food, but I never got that far. Walked in at 2:00PM on a Saturday, \"open\" sign was on outside and the posted hours were 10:00AM to 10:00PM. Four staff members in the restaurant (two eating at the bar) but nobody could be bothered to acknowledge our existence, much less seat us. I have to assume they launder money for organized crime, they're certainly not interested in giving people food in exchange for money."}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant a couple of times and always loved the food I had. Last weekend I was at a wedding catered by Big T's and was once again impressed by the food.  The smoked turkey was very good and was only overshadowed by the amazing brisket. I wasn't aware that Big T's did catering, but I'll definitely keep it in mind should I ever be looking to have an event catered.  Looking forward to returning to the restaurant soon!"}
{"text":"Second time attending; March, 2017, for a little girls birthday. Yep! She wanted ribs and wings. She got what she wanted and enjoyed the music atmosphere and helpful gentleman who waited on us. We had seen online that it was wing night but were told online can be misleading and there was no deal which I still don't think was ok but I did enjoy the flavours, quality and service."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most disappointing dine-in experiences I have ever had. We have heard so much from friends and have seen the \"You Gotta Eat Here\" episode about Big Ts that we thought we had to give it a try.   The place was quite busy, but the service was very quick and our servers weren't all too bad.  We ordered the Big Ts platter so we can try a bit of everything from their bbq menu. The platter definitely can feed at least 5 people in my opinion which is a plus, but most of the meats except the ribs were just mediocre(most were very dry) at best. The ribs were good, but they only gave you 4 pieces. The plate is filled with tons of fries that were just meh. And the coleslaw was bland. The buns and cornbread that come with the order were dry.  For $74 for the platter I really didn't think it was worth it. Good thing we didn't order the Elvis platter as that would be more disappointment for more money."}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent!  I took my wife and two kids here and they all enjoyed the food.  We came on a night when they were not busy so can't comment on the atmosphere but with young kids it was probably better this way."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place gets good reviews. I should provide a disclaimer that I'm from Texas so my standards for BBQ are high. With that said, I went there on Friday and my husband ordered the two meet meal for brisket and pork. He got brisket and chicken instead. The meat was ok not stellar and the portions are a bit small for what you pay. I've eaten there before and knew I wouldn't care for the smoked meat so I ordered the meatloaf which was smallish, flattened and grilled like a steak. Was very disappointed. They claimed on the menu that it was a giant slab but it came as. Hamburger patty sized slice. It's hard to mess up meatloaf so I'm slightly confused as to what the cook was doing. The service here absolutely stinks too. I ended up having to ask a different waiter (possibly the manager) for ketchup after asking ours and not receiving. Same with drinks. Holy smoke has better quality food."}
{"text":"I was beyond disappointed never had such terrible ribs! I was craving ribs so badly and when I ordered on skip the dishes it did come fast which was great but had I known it would be this tasteless and sauce less I would have never ordered. My St. Louis ribs with Original bbq sauce had barely any sauce so it was tasteless and the coleslaw was terrible I also ordered the spicy ribs but were WAY TOO spicy but still with barely any sauce. I would never order from here again. This place will NOT satisfy your rib craving. To be honest i ate one rib but I was so dissatisfied and couldn't eat any more bland sauceless ribs that I went to sobeys to buy groceries to cook instead."}
{"text":"We love going to Big T's BBQ.  Their pulled pork and brisket are great!  The fruit crisp desserts are wonderful too!  Being from Texas, we miss our BBQ, but Big T's brings us a little \"closer to home\"."}
{"text":"People who may easily get hurt by \"farm-n-ranch\" style decor and stakes burnt to the ground should rather stay away - for the rest of us, may be a good idea to drop in!  Well done at Big T's means really well done. And large portion is a really large portion. And decent prices are actually decent. Plus, they work fast and service is nice and helpful.  Whenever in the area and in doubt where to, I easily suggest Big T's - and so far they were standing well, serving these large plates of well done meat.  They also give toys to the kids, and tolerate them goofing around - which is nice!  I like it. I will be back. And I suggest checking them out - unless you don't feel like lamps made of tin buckets, and love your steak so tender it seems alive and breathing..."}
{"text":"Big T's is friggin amazing ok, that is all. Beef brisket...three words......\"To die for\". Baked beans are fabulous as well. One day I will marry a 15lb beef brisket from Big T's. Also Andrew who works at the farmers market location, he da man!"}
