{"text":"Hey Meatball! Hey Mediocre! Walking into Hey Meatball! instantly feels like you are walking into your old high school cafeteria. A few two and four person tables are set up, and there's one long 16 person table down the middle, all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners. I wasn't entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction. We inquired with the cashier/order taker/owner to find out. I know he was the owner because he told us.  For a restaurant that serves all meatballs, all the time, we were surprised to find that there were only three entrée selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from. Of the four side dishes, two had already been crossed out for the day, leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup. I decided to order the vegetarian eggplant 'meatballs' with polenta and parmesan, and my dining partner ordered the Porky  meatballs, (a combination of pork and ground beef) with tomato sauce on spaghetti. Immediately I was told that they were out of polenta and was asked \"what would I like it on?\" Unsure of my options, even after asking, I replied with \"spaghetti,\" as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that I was sure that they had in stock.  We each ordered a homemade cream soda, we were given a number, and we took a seat. Our number was called out about 10 minutes later, and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size. My eggplant 'meatballs' were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti, whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the children's menu- if there was one that is.  The food was good, but not great. The eggplant 'meatballs' had a nice consistency, and were spicy and full of flavor. The tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty, however I thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more. The Porky meatballs were excellent, the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit, however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dish.  The saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site. They were a throwback to the Jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid, but without too much fizz. Unfortunately, when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience, you know that there is something missing.  Hey Meatball! is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen, communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100-mile radius of Toronto. All great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable. There was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made Hey Meatball! mostly a letdown."}
{"text":"Originally tried at a food stand at Pride and have been meaning to visit the restaurant for a while.  + delicious, organic meat + well rounded menu (employ different uses, flavours of meatballs) + fast service (aprox 10 mins from ordering to meatballs in hand) + most interesting, colourful side salad I've ever had  - not a bargain _____________________________________________________ Original idea and well executed.  A little bit on the pricey side, but the quality is there so I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It must have taken years to develop a recipe for both leaden meatballs and tasteless tomato sauce as bland as the fare served here.  Lacking in herbs, garlic and anything resembling flavour this \"cash only\" place - which doesn't even take debit cards - neither delivers value for the money spent nor a reason to return.  There is not enough Parmesan cheese in Italy to redeem this stuff - not that they offer any.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"Love this place - great comfort food. Definitely get the pork meatballs in tomato sauce and a chopped salad for a delicious, simple lunch.  Their salads have fresh, seasonal ingredients with pickled veg often. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The pork meatballs are the best flavour- the other ones were somewhat dry. I recommend the the rigatoni it's amazing! I have gone back a few times now and the flavour has been consistent."}
{"text":"This place should have 5 star rating by default. I got the spaghetti and my gf got the  meatball sandwich.  Amazing flavors and spice level. Felt like heaven when eating it. I will definitely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Great meal. Risotto with chicken meatballs was spectacular. Loved the pesto. The Rodfather sandwich incorporates the best of what they do. Must try. Kids loved the spaghetti and meatballs. Sodas are ok - nothing special. Service was pathetic - disinterested staff. Self service place and I tipped well but still they forgot my lemonade and had to be reminded to make it (although there was no one else in the restaurant.) More busy talking to each other."}
{"text":"The only good thing they had were the deep fried risottos balls -which they only had for the Little Italy Festival. I would go there all the time if they continued them. Their other dishes are either too bland or too salty. Horrible."}
{"text":"Good place if you want something relatively quick and fairly cheap that's not standard fast food. I would suggest not getting takeout if you plan on ordering a sandwich like the Godfather (probably their best seller). The sauce they use (that's delicious) makes the ciabatta bun soggy by the time you get home. Worth checking out though it's a solid spot for sure."}
{"text":"No where else in the city are you going to get a gourmet type meal for $12.  Sure you can go with the Rodfather sandwich, but if you go with someone else, definitely share and try the polenta and rib, or the risotto and switch the meat balls (no need to get the veggie ones).  The quality for the price is unbelievable."}
{"text":"if I wasn't hungry I won't eat here. it was late night and I need something to grab with my friend other than sandwich. so I was happy to see this restaurant was open. I told staff that it was my first time here. she wasn't all that friendly. I order spaghetti with meatball and chicken pasta. it was overcooked pasta and pricy for what I got."}
{"text":"Beet side was great. Side salad was fresh  and crunchy. Meatballs lacked spice. Beef was the best of the three options. I suggest getting all beef and splitting the sides for an entire meal."}
{"text":"Apparently this place was on Drivers, Dine-ins and Dives so I had high expectations. I was really disappointed. The place is in an area of Toronto called Little Italy. It was empty when we arrived and the cashier was very low in energy. I ordered the rigatoni dish with meatballs and my boyfriend ordered the Rodfather. My dish was disappointing - the noodles were under and the meatballs were dry. The Rodfather, however, was pretty good. I stole some bites from my boyfriend. The hygiene of the place is a bit questionable. There were some dead flies by the window and the cup that I had with water had marks of purple lipstick, which I wasn't wearing."}
{"text":"Best meatball sandwich I've had in Toronto. For what you get the portions are't crazy big - small salads particularly- but the meatballs have enough weight to fill any belly. The Rodfather is a great, gourmet style Big Mac clone that is awesome. Around $12 for meal and drink."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff. It is great that Toronto has more and more places where you can find local meats, organic veg etc...Hey Meatball is one of them. It is comfort food which will warm you up and amazing solution for hangover. Signature Rodfather sandwich is a must to try. Those 13$ worth it!"}
{"text":"Yay this place was good! I really wanted to like it....and I did. It is cafeteria style so don't expect a fancy restaurant  The food was GOOD! My husband had the Rodfather....SO good! Quite large as well. The pesto really set it apart from just any old meatball sandwich and the meatballs were really yummy. We shared the mac and cheese with meatballs and I was obsessed. I just kept eating it. I think I had more than he did (oops).  I had the spaghetti and meatballs and this was the only dish that wasn't amazing. Don't get me wrong, the meatballs were really good, and you could tell that the pasta was fresh, but the sauce was on the boring side and there wasn't enough cheese for my liking.  So! Basically....come eat here! You will like it....theres something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap!  Took my young daughters there this afternoon and we ordered spaghetti and meatballs for them to share and the polenta/ribs/sausage/meatball dish for me.  The meatballs at this place are delicious and my daughters ate way more than they usually do.  The serving sizes are very large too.  My polenta/ribs/sausage/meatballs was fantastic.  The polenta was perfectly creamy and all the meats were perfect. Even the sausage, which I kind of expected to be a standard bland sausage was very flavourful and even had a kick to it.  Hot sauces are very tasty, but neither one is that hot.  No big deal though.  Although I usually douse everything in hot sauce, you should really first taste the stuff here.  Its all fresh and you probably don't want to disguise the great flavour too much.  Soda's are expensive but home made and the real thing. Both the Cream Soda and Lime Soda were excellent.  I guess they are no more expensive than a fancy canned Italian soda, but they are definitely better.  The downside of the fresh and tasty cooking is that it takes a while to prepare your order, so just be aware.  Also, that Polenta would have gone perfect with a nice cold beer, but it's not licensed.  Maybe I'll try and rush home with takeout next time to down it with a beer, but may be risky with polenta."}
{"text":"Hey Meatball is one of its kind. The food is incredibly tasty, i can't get enough of their Polenta and for those like me that love meatballs, this is the place to eat. The girl behind the counter is a great server and really good with the clients. Not the cheapest option out there but worth the money."}
{"text":"Tried Hey Meatball for the first time for supper last night. Really really enjoyed it. I had the Eastender(?) which is a spicy beef meatloaf with picked cabbage, provolone, sautéed onion and donair sauce. Was spicier than I was expecting, but nothing I couldn't handle. I thought it could have used more donair sauce, not because it was dry or lacking in flavour - I just LOVE donair sauce. Sandwich came with a side salad of mixed greens, mixed veg (possibly giardinara) and a light vinaigrette. It was delicious and absolutely filling.  The other half had the Rod Father, their standard meatball sammy, which was also really tasty; loved the addition of pesto, but if I'm being picky could've benefited from some cheese, perhaps on the bottom of the bun to keep it from falling apart in the amazing marinara.  His came with a side Caesar (the lovely woman at the counter said she wanted us to have both salad options which was awesome). We both also had their in house soda - cream sodas were delicious, and I look forward to trying all their soda flavours in the future.  Another couple we saw with pasta and polenta - looked really good, and that will probably what I check out next."}
{"text":"First I have to say that I am vegetarian. I rarely ever go to vegan and vegetarian places, and what impresses me is a place that I can go to with a 'normal' friend and find something to eat that isn't standard issue pasta.   I think I first heard of Hey Meatball back in the days I'd watch 'Diners, Drive-in and Dives' obsessively. Vaguely considered going there over the last couple of years, and one thing led to another, and well... I didn't.  I saw publicity on them grow in recent times. While most of it involved careful mention of a veggie version, I prematurely dismissed them as just another one of those who dish out the 'fake meat' alternative and think its something that someone who voluntarily gave up meat (because, mostly, they didn't like it) would like.  Finally, I decided to give it a shot with an open veggie mind and went with a visiting friend who's a dedicated meat eater. So all would not be lost if the veggie version sucked.  Off we headed, to what I think is the original one on the west end of College. It was empty at lunchtime, which isn't usually a great sign.   The people at the restaurant (really more a cafeteria setting with a smallish eat in area and DIY service giving you all the basics with a bit of personality) explained things to us and made some recos. I went with the veggie balls on risotto. That was the only listed veggie option on the menu besides a sandwich, though you do have a mix and match option where you can put any balls together with any sauce and side.  We fetched our drinks and headed over to a table to await our food, which arrived in a most timely manner. Kudos for promptness. And I'll throw some kudos in there for the ginger soda. Nice. Would've been nicer with some booze added... but hey that's just me ;).  Lunch arrived. My friend ordered the beef meatball with spaghetti. We loaded up on some condiments and prepared to dig in. He said his was great. A good meatball with good sauce. He looked happy, ate the entire portion and didn't speak a whole lot, which is always a good sign .  And mine? O.... M... G... and I do not use that lightly.  The veggie balls were amazing. Really. They tasted of beans and spices and veggies. Real food. Perfect hold-together-but-melt-in-your-mouth texture. Everything I like in a good burger, in the guise of a super gorgeous meatball, which us vegetarians barely ever get to enjoy.   Nestled in a lovely cloud of creamy, mushroom-ey risotto. Mmmmmm... mmmmmm... mmmm. That risotto!! Hit the perfect spot between creamy as heck and just slightly al dente rice. So good. An awful lot of effort put into a side. Which it really wasn't; quantitatively. It was a massive, generous portion, topped with 3 big veggie balls. All of which I demolished. Didn't eat for aaaaages after but it was worth it.  Special mention, by the way, to the condiments. There were 2 chili-sauce-meet-relish options. One was a medium jalapeno. And the other was a spicy habanero. When they say spicy, they aren't kidding; so maybe start slow and see what you can take. It was insanely good though.  All in all, a definite must-go. Take a serious appetite when you do."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by any restaurants seen on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and Hey Meatballs continues the streak. Had the Rodfather sandwich which was very good and came with an excellent  salad on the same plate. My wife had the polenta dish with the braised rib, sausage and a vegan meatball topped with a bolognese sauce. It was also very good and fortunately she found the sausage a bit spicy which meant I got to eat most of it. The homemade orange soda I had was only okay and the straw was better suited for stirring. It is cash only."}
{"text":"Always a delight, tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. Although the beef and pork meatballs are great, the true test were the chicken and vegan meatballs, and they are just as delicious as the their more traditional counterparts. If its your first time, I would suggest the rigatoni with chicken meatballs, the greens in the rigatoni are an added bonus that help lighten up this heart meal ( in a good way)"}
{"text":"Went to the Leslieville location on Queen. Love this place, the rod father and the burger ball are super tasty. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So maybe I just don't get it? I know this place is pretty popular and has had good reviews but honestly I was very disappointed.  Ordered the three meatballs in the mushroom gravy.  First of all the meatballs were TINY...maybe the size of a golf ball and were basically buried in this thick soup of a gravy.  I literally had to dig to find them.  Secondly, holy sodium Batman.  By the time I found and had a bite out of my second meatball my lips were burning and I was downing water like it was going out of style.  Needless to say I didn't come close to finishing the two remaining meatballs.    My partner had the three meatballs with sauce.  Also very tiny but didn't seem to suffer from the salt issue so perhaps it was the gravy that was the culprit.  He wasn't blown away but said it was decent.   Due to the size (or lack thereof), he was still hungry afterwards so he tried a bite from mine and promptly pushed it away.    Looks like there is a new location opening on Roncey (my extended 'hood) so I might try that one just to give it a fair shake but definitely won't go back to the location on College."}
{"text":"The two stars is for the food, I'd give a four star rate for the place and people. Funky little spot, friendly, laid back people (maybe too laid back, took a long time to get food). I SO wanted to love the food, I have regular meatball cravings and hoped this would be the place to go. Ordered the spag and meatballs. Meatballs were tough and really not seasoned well. Portion size was pretty tiny for $12 considering there were no sides, no bread, no salad, nada.  Might come back in the summer for another try but won't be top of my list"}
{"text":"Twelve dollars for a meatball sandwich and you don't take debit? What the hell is that?"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Hey Meatball, I was thoroughly impressed with the space, friendly staff and the food. I ordered the RodFather (vegan meatball sandwich), which was so tasty - great sauce-to-bread ratio, cheese lightly melting over the yummy eggplant balls that were expertly made and the salad that came with was fresh. For $12 I was thoroughly satisfied and vowed to retun.  Visit #2 was pretty lack-lustre. The staff was still great, but this time I ordered the mac+cheese, which tasted like it used a powdered form of cheese and was more gluey and ooey-gooey, and the vegan meatballs atop the pasta were burnt on the bottom and mushy in the middle. Very disappointing, but I wanted to give it another shot in case they had an 'off' night.  Round 3 was the Rodfather again - I wanted to have that amazing experience like the first time I ate here. Not so much. The eggplant balls were mushy, the sauce ratio was off so that the bun became soggy and there wasn't enough cheese this time. So sad when you have that expectation of greatness and it doesn't deliver.  Consistency with food is a problem here, in my experience, and I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered the Rodfather. I will definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"I was around the area, and tried to go to the Fish Store owned by Korean, but they were closed on Sunday. Soooo, I opted to come again to this joint bringing my bro. As you know their menu is quite simple all written in a chalk board. What I don't understand is eventhough the menu is not too complex, that its actually possible they cannot be better at delivering better food.   I got their spaghetti and meatball and find it is not worth $12. Their meatball is dry, but at least their pasta is alright. It didn't really fill me at all. My bro got the 'Rodfather' and wasn't that impressed as well. This is probably our last visit after having dry meatballs twice."}
{"text":"I was really excited to hear that a new shop was opening in Leslieville, although I'm not sure we really need another sandwich place.  Anyhow, I was let down.    Portions were extremely small for the price and service was, well... fairly non-existent.  I gave it a second try figuring maybe the issues were attributed to opening pains.  Second sandwich, bland and cold, although the portion was slightly larger than before.  For the price, portions, lack of friendly service, and just an average looking place, I doubt I'll be back.  Too bad."}
{"text":"The Rodfather meatball sandwich was awesome! For meatballs it didn't taste too meaty, so it was good till the last bite! Mac and Cheese was delicious, same with the spareribs dish (I forget what it's called)! Food is great!!!! But the homemade soda is ok. Not sure if they serve normal drinks like Coke! Better yet, if they serve beers it would be perfect! No I'm not an alcoholic, just saying that it would compliment the food!! Go! It's really good! If you live close by, get take out and eat at home with your favourite beverage (beer!)!"}
{"text":"I'll try to keep this short. Had gone to Rosebud years back so followed the reputation to finally check this place out. I don't live in this neighborhood anymore so my GF and I dropped in when we were coming through. No issues with the space, cash only etc ...   I actually tried the vegetarian meatballs w risotto, the GF Rodfather. One mistake might have been that we took it to go which might have effected the quality, but I found the veg meatball pretty dry and the risotto nothing to get super excited about.   I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but would probably go back if in the area and eat in next time."}
{"text":"Awesome meat balls, super tasty pasta and yummy home made hot sauce. The side salad is delicious"}
{"text":"Picked up spaghetti and beef meatballs for lunch today.  Meatballs were way over worked and tough.  Spaghetti, over cooked and mushy.  Bolognese sauce was oily.  Couldn't eat any of it.   Our take out order was missing a salad, not noticed until we got home.   Eaten there before but not sure if we'd do it again."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Went here for the first time earlier today with my bf. Got the mac and cheese with meatballs and the spaghetti. First thing that struck me about the spaghetti was how awesome the noodles tasted. Fresh, cooked just perfectly, not too soft, but chewy and delicious. Tomato sauce was nice. Parm was fresh and meat balls were BIG and tasty.  Mac and cheese was rich! tasted of strong melted cheddar. yum.  Even though the meatballs were both pork and beef mix, they tasted different in each dish, which I appreciated.  And for 11 or 12 bucks per dish, how can you go wrong?  The space was clean, welcoming and casual. Retro hits playing. Definitely plan on taking a few friends here soon! (cash only, btw)"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend last night.  I thought the staff were great - we were greeted right when we walked through the door.  We told him it was our first time and he was helpful in answering any questions we had about the menu.    I ordered the Rob Father, and she ordered the chicken balls.  My Rob father was amazing.  I couldn't even express how good it was.  I decided to deconstruct it because I couldn't figure out how to fit the thing in my mouth, but it was still delicious and amazing.  The salad was fresh, with the right amount of dressing and lots of different flavours.  My buddy's chicken balls were pretty amazing as well, and she was in heaven and very pleased with  her order.  We were both pleased to learn they are opening up a second location on the east end, closer to us, so we'll definitely come back.    I know a couple of the people on here were calling for more peppers on the Rodfather, and they had two kinds of in house \"hot sauces\" for the dishes.  I tried both (definitely prefer the jalepeno) and felt it totally made my dish.  Do agree with the ones who said it could use more cheese - cheese makes everything go from awesome to super awesome.    Also had the homemade grapefruit soda - LOVED IT.  Definitely want to try the cream soda and the mint tea next.    This place is bare bones, comforting, and very home like. I like the openness of the area and the cafeteria style seating.  Maybe not the most amazing place for a first date (or maybe it is!) but we both really liked it and appreciated it."}
{"text":"I have already been there several times for take out. The pasta and the sauce are amazing. My favorite is the rigatoni and my kids love the spaghetti. The food is always great. Very consistent."}
{"text":"Love it! Prices are more than reasonable. The food is also very flavourful and the portion size is amazing! Awesome spot to pick up lunch.   Just annoying that they only accept cash.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We tried it when they first opened. Service was great but the meatballs were gross. The meat needs to be ground more way too chewy with gristle."}
{"text":"Small shop, great for take out or very casual eating in. 3 long tables that seat 8 each and a few seats at the window for people watching.   I came for impromptu dinner with my kids and it was great. Prepared quickly so great for a fast bite, pretty easy on the budget, very friendly staff, and food was good. We ate the spaghetti in marinara, rigatoni in bolognese and Caesar salad. Pastas were $12 and salad was $5.   Will come back again."}
{"text":"I love the staff and the food here. I've had three different sandwiches and they've all been delicious. Kind, friendly, speedy service!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my family and love the food. Very good. I've ordered the veggie meatballs and they were excellent. My husband ordered the regular meatballs and he enjoyed them too. The coleslaw-salad (can't remember what it's called on the menu) is really, really good. It's a mixture of different hardy greens. If you like vinegar/oil coleslaw dressings, you'll enjoy it.   The food is 5 stars but I am taking away one star for a few reasons. First, they only take cash. They seriously need to take debit but I guess cash only makes for easy accounting ;-) Second, though the food is great, it's still expensive considering the portion you get. Third, when my husband asked for more cheese, the lady said he would have to pay another Dollar for it. They only put a few sprinkles of cheese on his meal. They wouldn't add a little more without him paying a dollar. They should be ashamed for that. Luckily for them the food is really good. If we're in the area we will go back (but bring our own cheese) ;-)."}
{"text":"Ordered mac& cheese. Since the meatball is the feature, I won't much attention on the mac&cheese. What I expected for meatball: juicy, chewy, tight, but this one is dry, soft(?). One good thing is the little spice in it. And it's really really really really salty.  For the mac&cheese, it tastes so thick that I was n't able to finish it. I like its canteen setting. Friendly staff. But the cleanliness is average.  It is more like a community based place. Kind of disappointed for traveling 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Great Mac and Cheese, very relaxed and friendly, despite it being thanksgiving.  They just opened so be patient as they're doing cash for now.  Next time, I try the Eastender."}
{"text":"Just happened to blunder into this place while walking Queen St, and I figured 'Yeah, i like restaurant names that casually insult me.', so in I went.   I was greeted by a very friendly lady at the counter who sensed my bewilderment, and offered to take me through the menu.  I ended up settling on the Rodfather (the Hey Meatball specialty, apparently), a tasty sandwich of pork meatballs, tomato sauce, cheese and pesto.  Add to that a tasty homemade lemon lime soda, and I didn't even care about the insulting name.   This was a dynamite meal with great flavour; seriously couldn't have asked for better.  If I had to nitpick something: they left the door open on a sunny day in March, and as I ate my little toesies got cold. But, small price to pay for a great meal."}
{"text":"Got takeout, so thats probably let the food deteriorate a little bit to be fair. That said it was ok, but just kind of bland and for what it was quite expensive. I went classic got the beef, again ok i just expected so much more. Meh sums it up"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese very nice. If you like \"fancy\", take a pass. If you don't care and like good food, give it a try."}
{"text":"It was rainy. It was cold. Basically hot Meatball Sandwich kind of weather.  Glad they have opened up shop in Leslieville, because distance was the only thing that prevented me from visiting their Little Italy outlet.  As soon as I walked in, I was ensconced in the aroma of tomato sauce. Like are they pumping this stuff through the vents or something? Either way, it was heavenly, and definitely perked up my salivary glands.  Had to go with the owner's namesake, the Rodfather. 3 Pork meatballs, marinara, and pesto all slathered and heaped onto a toasted Ciabatta bun. The glutton in me then ordered the Mac and Cheese, because the weather dictated it.  The sandwich was Nom-y. The tomato sauce tasted like it had been simmering for hours. Super mellow with some acidity, and lively floral notes from the herbs (Basil and Oregano I think). I know a lot of reviewers eat this sandwich with a knife and fork, but I decided it was in my best interest to unhinge my jaw and go in for the kill. Totally worth it!  The Mac and Cheese was good, but not revolutionary. The sauce had a floury taste to it. Not enough cheese in the Béchamel to bring out the gooey cheese factor that one would hope for.  Oh, and special mention of the side salad. It had a tangy/sweet dressing and lots of different veg tossed in. Loved it!  The only thing that kind of sucked was that the front door was open through our meal, which meant that our food got cold fast.  Other than that, I am sold. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I loved everything - the mac and cheese is hedonistic. The meatball is truly eye rollingly good. Man, I love eating."}
{"text":"I was lured to Hey Meatball with the promise of a free burger during Burger Week. First off, I have to say that the staff were amazing, totally understanding and accommodating despite the long line.  Now to the burger. One word: damn. I wasn't totally convinced about a meatball burger but they did a great job. There were two options, one vegan and one pork. Both were delicious. The pork had tomato gravy, mozzarella cheese, pesto, and the absolute perfect bun. I'll definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"My son and I went for lunch today.  DO NOT expect anything special.  It falls in to Guy Fieri\"s category of \"DIVE\".  The staff are wonderful!!  Friendly and helpful and informative and fun.  You order your food at the \"counter\" and go and sit down at one of the very few tables.  I would say it would probably seat about 30 at small tables and uncomfortable, painted, metal chairs. You collect your cutlery at a side table along with napkins and the \"hot sawce\" which as someone said, is really just a green pepper relish.  It does pack a bit of a punch tho\".  The forks are really appetizer forks (small) and the spoons for swirling spaghetti are tiny.   The food is a big bore!  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  I had to ask for salt it was so bland,  The meatballs are OK but nothing to write home about, the spaghetti in a meat tomato sauce was ordinary, and I think the spaghetti was actually linguini (which doesn't really matter).  The portion was small.   My son had the burger.  It came with a nice side salad.  He said there was hardly any meat in it but it was OK.   I also ordered a \"chopped salad\" which was probably the best thing we ate.  We also each had a homemade cream soda.  All this for $35.00 and a $5.00 tip.   I am sure there are a lot of people who would really like this place but I can think of a dozen places where I can get a much better lunch for two for $40.00. The whole concept is a neat idea but it really needs some work on the food to give it a better value, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.  I had the pork meatball sandwich.  I don't know, wasn't all that good.  I got a sandwich.  The meatballs were slightly on the tough side, if you can believe that.  Were somewhat bland and tasteless.  The sauce was whatever, it's just tomato.  Too much bread, i threw the other half out.  The salad was meh.  Overall, messy sandwich and not worth the hassle of maneuvering every bite of it.  Food was just a mere OK.  If you're going to eat a garbage sandwich, you may as well get Subway -- the way you like it."}
{"text":"3.5*   Stopped in for a light bite during the day last week and was pleasantly full afterwards. I didn't go all out but really wanted to try their meatballs. How convenient that they offered a snack-sized four-meatball plate with sauce, along with three pieces of crostini drizzled in olive oil for $7! I ordered that plus a gigantic honkin' side of roasted root vegetables ($5) which was probably my favourite part of the meal that was supposed to be a snack.   The meatballs were nice and dense so while you may anticipate four measly meatballs rolling around in a sea of sauce, these're actually a pretty good size. They weren't overly flavourful, however, and the sauce was a little more tangy than I prefer. As for the crusty slices of baguette that accompany, I think they would be better off not so hard so that one could sop up the sauce with them. Even one more piece of bread would be nice so it's one slice per meatball, but then again, maybe I'm just being greedy.  The best part was the roasted root veggies. There were some pretty tasty-sounding sides available but this one really did it for me. It was cold out and the thought of these homey vegetables was just what I needed and damn were they good! The soft onions, carrots and *my fave* parsnips were roasted perfectly and required no effort to slice through with a fork--perfect if you're missing all your teeth, they were just that soft! They had a hint of cinnamon and maybe nutmeg? A giant plate of those would have been snack enough. I topped it all off with an apple cider soda ($3? Their sodas are all made in-house) that hit the spot as well.  Everything is fresh and seems to be homemade, and the staff are really nice and friendly. It's mostly self-serve after you place your order at the counter which is in the back of the shop, so don't expect anyone to bring you cutlery and napkins. The decor is kitschy but not over-the-top or anything, and the music could stand to be turned down just a bit.  I admire that someone would have the balls (no pun intended) to go opening a meatball restaurant so they get the extra half-star for that. Hopefully they'll survive as I don't think meatballs will be the next craze or anything but the good thing is that they offer plenty of other items on their chalkboard menu which are sure to change from time to time, and I look forward to trying some of them during future visits.   *Note that it's cash only (prices include tax) and got pretty busy as 6pm approached which is a good sign."}
{"text":"AAAAAAAAA I LOVE THIS PLACE!  the staff were friendly and food was awesome.  probably the best mac and cheese I've ever had.  my friends and i also shared The Rodfather, Polenta with braised ribs and meatball and Mushroom Risotto with Vegetarian Meatballs.  The Rodfather was good. 3 pork and beef meatballs covered with tomato sauce and pesto served with ciabatti. wonderful combo. the salad's a tad salty though.  the Polenta with ribs was amazing. i love the consistency and the meat sauce that goes with it.   not really a fan of the Mushroom Risotto. it's too salty in my opinion, prolly because of the pesto. vegetarian meatballs was good but i like the pork+beef ones better. if you're not a vegetarian, don't order this one.  pork+beef meatballs were juicy and succulent! they're just wonderful. five stars!!  they have special size dishes for kids.  they serve chicken meatballs too if i remember correctly. and HOMEMADE SODA!!  plus, it's located just across this Sicilian Cafe which has EXCELLENT fresh made to order canolli and zippole so you can head over for dessert!"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend and we both got the meatball sandwich. Meatballs were tough, sauce was LOADED with salt and the bread was so soggy it was almost impossible to pick up and eat.   Completely overrated - if you want an Italian meatball sandwich for a good price hit San Francesco's around the corner from here."}
{"text":"overall delicious but may make a few modifications next time  Mac and cheese with beef meatballs, mac and cheese was creamy the entire time with just enough crisp on top. The beef meatballs were a bit grainy in relation to the pasta so I'd probably go for the pork meatballs in the future (I think you need the fat to properly match textures)  Chicken meatballs with mashed potatoes: chicken meatballs were delicious (the meat was smooth and well cooked without being dry). The mashed potatoes were a bit on the watery side (I prefer mine more rustic and less mashed) but still tasty  Overall definitely worth going to again"}
{"text":"Ah la prétention de la jeunesse. Oui les 'meatballs' sont bons, mais la cuisine ressemble plus à une cour de récré par l'atmosphère qui y règne : ce projet semble être celui d'un petit groupe de 'hipsters', ces néo-bourgeois bohèmes qui s'imaginent avoir tout découvert et tout inventé. Ça plaît, enfin ça plaît beaucoup à cette nouvelle génération qui croit que le service c'est parler et plaisanter avec ses copains en prenant votre commande. Et surtout, laissez vos mioches courir partout en hurlant, la vie ce n'est que du Montessori à grande échelle ..."}
{"text":"I took my daughter today for her birthday lunch with her friend and she wanted spaghetti and meatball ...... Yum I ordered that and it was amazing ! I ate the meatball and cheese plate which came with toasted Bread slice it was delicious I loved their habanero hot sauce.  I advised it was my daughters birthday and they immediately said drinks are on the house which I thought it was an amazing gesture on their part   I would recommend this place definitely Let's just say I ordered 2 more sandwiches to go pop them on my panini press and voila crispy at home . Keep up great customer service guys"}
{"text":"First off, I gotta start this review with my usual middle finger in the sky to the city of Toronto. I love you, T.O., but in such a Nietzschean fashion that I can only express that love as an endless challenge: \"Be better. Do better!\"   For instance, why I gotta come into this place at 3pm on a Saturday while every useless bruncherie in the city is packed to rafters, and have me, my girl and Rod Bowers and his little assistant be the only people in the place?   No complaints about the food though. Had a Rodfather sandwich, some roasted root veggies and a ginger ale.   Everything was good. The salad that accompanies the Rodfather is carefully composed with little bits of parsley and cale (that's right, THE John Cale!) and cauliflower (and a whole lot of other neat stuff) livened up by a puckery vinegar dressing. The bread tomato sauce reaction is particularly strong on this sandwich...you could just eat a bread and tomato soaker and that would be plenty good. Meatballs are strong; I'm a pretty big meatball snob... but I have no clue where a better commercially available ball is in Toronto. Roasted root veg prompted a conversation about how come we can't make such good roasted veg at home. Homemade ginger was just beggin to be mixed with some good tequila or some Goslings, but pretty nice all on its own. About $20 all in.   Stop disappointing me Torontonians. Cook your own damn eggs, and do your saturday lunching at the Meatball. HEY MEATBA-AAAAAAALLL!"}
{"text":"Meatballs?  I love meatballs!  This started a long walk from Scotiabank theatre to Hey Meatball, to try one of these damn tasty meatballs I've heard about.    I looked up and down the menu and settled on the spaghetti and meatballs.  They also make home made soda, so I ordered a grapefruit soda.  We sat down and in no time flat, our meal was ready.  The grapefruit soda was AWESOME!  I wish I could find this at more places around town.  The spaghetti and meatball was far from the best that I've tried but man it was definitely flavourful and had many of the right flavours.  The spaghetti itself was ok but cooked right.  If I could give this place a 3.5 I would but I had a pretty solid experience here so don't mind sitting it at a 4 star.  If I ever have a spaghetti and meatball craving I'd definitely keep this place high on the list."}
{"text":"Delicious spaghetti!  I was very impressed considering the reviews.  I had the spaghetti with beef meatballs. The staff behind the counter were friendly and quick to get us our orders but not rush us.   When the spaghetti came out it was a decent portion size, and had 3 meatballs on top. By the first look I wasn't expecting too much from it- but the taste pleasantly  surprised me! Even though the pasta noodle its self looked to be my linguini... The sauce had a good flavor, and the meat was as well seasoned.   I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff but I'm not super stoked about the meatballs here.  Gave it a try because it was featured on triple D.  Ordered the rodfather and meatballs were a little too salty (too much Parmesan) and not enough marinara sauce.  But that salad that comes with it is so delicious!  Stuff it in the sandwich and it makes a whole lot of difference.  Had great expectations but left feeling ok.  Give it a try for your own experience though!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the excellent reviews. I had the 3 pork meatballs with fresh bread and the chopped salad. The meatballs where slightly firm and juicy. The sauce would hold its own against the most hi end Italian restaurant. The bread was homemade and served warm. The chopped salad was fresh with nice combo veggies with a light vinegar dressing. It was all very good! Wash it down with some homemade soda. I had the grapefruit. I don't like sweet sodas and asked for mine with less syrup. It was excellent."}
{"text":"On top of spaghetti, All covered with cheese, There were 3 meatballs (Omnomnom) Give me more, please!  Hey Meatball has been on my list for awhile! I was on my way to the Royal Cinema and stopped in to grab a bite and get out of the cold.    It's not a big place and it was reasonably busy for a Monday night. I wasn't sure what to order and even though I was tempted by the signature Rodfather, I thought it might be too heavy.  They recommended that I get the 3 meatballs and garlic toast ($7) and a salad ($5).  The meatballs were piping hot and super melty-soft. I savored each wonderful warm and juicy bite! Mmmmmeatball. Sooooo goood.    I don't think I can ever have Ikea meatballs again. (Okay, I lie. Obviously, Hey Meatball is clearly a cut above rest, but I won't turn down Ikeaballs).  The salad was a lot more filling and larger than expected. Delicious kale and cauliflower with a light vinaigrette. I was surprised that it actually was worth $5 dollars for a side salad.  Hey Meatball!  I'll be back for more. I was going to insert a balls pun here, but I won't. :P"}
{"text":"Pasta and balls are all pretty awesome; same goes for the homemade Italian soda.  Greens salad was pretty bad -- way too freaking sour. The whole thing tasted like pickles. Probably because it was full of pickled vegetables."}
{"text":"When I saw this cute and charming restaurant open up down the street, I was excited to give it a try. The first few times I walked by, they were still adding finishing touches to the store and I was told to come back later when they were opened. Of course, I understood because they were busy so I left.  Came back a couple days later, it was maybe 10 minutes before opening. Keep in mind it was middle of winter and freezing cold, and I was told by an employee to come back when they were opened even though everyone was just standing around inside. They could've at least offered us a seat until they were ready. :/  Obviously, I was not going to stand outside for 15 minutes in the cold when I can just have dinner in another restaurant down the street. I was really disappointed to be treated like that, especially since I was basically almost their first potential customer!  Bleh, I walk by all the time but never even thought twice about coming in here. Maybe one day I will try."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome staff. Reasoning for 4 stars is that they seem to use instant potatoes for the Mashed Potatoes.  Mushroom Gravy is awesome but $7 for instant potatoes is a bit silly, and detracts from the gravy.  Everything else here is fresh and homemade down to the sodas... Don't understand the use of potatoes from a box."}
{"text":"Let me show you how... This is based on family tradition.  There are ways to perfect a meatball. You don't have the inherited piece that's past down through the generations. Sorry..."}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of work colleagues for lunch. The food is really fresh and delightful. The side salad in particular stood at for it's freshness and flavours. I would recommend the place for lunch time for sure. The only concern is that the price point is a little on the high side for the area."}
{"text":"We are a family of six. We tried several dishes and ate family style. We loved the Caesar salad, Mac & Cheese with Meatballs, rigatoni with meatballs, spaghetti with meatballs, and mashed potato with meatballs. We enjoyed the food so much that we ate at the Queen street location the next day. We were only in Toronto for 3 Days. 12 thumbs up from the Ratcliffe Family from Michigan."}
{"text":"When I first heard of this eatery and saw a picture of macaroni and cheese with meatballs, I thought, \"This place was invented for me.\"  So I went there and ordered the meal I saw in that photo, which was $12, taxes included. The macaroni and cheese was good, if a bit too salty, and the meatballs were very tasty. The portion was a pretty good size, though I would've preferred a bit more.  The decor was kind of lazy - casual to a fault. But decor isn't a big factor when I rate a restaurant.  I think a few of the negative reviewers here don't understand what kind of place this is supposed to be. Someone wrote that the meatballs were dry. They were indeed a bit on the dry side, but this isn't a regular restaurant; their goal is basically to provide quality fast food, and that's exactly what I got. They don't cook the food after you arrive; they prepare it. You pay when you order, and they call your name for you to come to the counter to get it. If that's not the kind of restaurant experience you were looking for, go elsewhere. As far as I'm concerned, Hey Meatball delivers exactly what it aims to. I look forward to going back and trying different dishes."}
{"text":"Woohoo meatballs, homemade sodas, talk of organic ice cream. Walls lined with canned goods... So pretty much heaven.  UPDATE: the creamy, cheesy polenta is the stuff dreams are made of...so good"}
{"text":"I finally made it here after much hoopla about the place after it was featured on Drive, Diners and Drives.  I have to say it was a mediocre eating experience.  The Meatballs were not as big as I built up in my mind I suppose.  It's just a bigger than average meatball.  The pork meatball was good though, however it didn't blow me away.  The pasta and sauce was also plain, I kept thinking that I could have just made this at home myself while eating - which is never a good sign."}
{"text":"Walking into a place called Hey Meatball as a vegetarian, I didn't really have the greatest expectations... but I had heard good things! The woman at the cash register told me I could replace the meatballs in anything on the menu with vegetarian balls, but I decided to be boring and order the one dish that was already vegetarian - the mushroom risotto with pesto, cheese, and veggie balls. The risotto was creamy, velvety, and smooth. The rice and mushrooms had great taste to go along with the texture (did I mention that it was melt in your mouth?). The dish as a whole didn't really work for me though. I don't know if the pesto really belonged on the plate and I'm just not hugely into parmesan (I think it was parmesan at least). The veggie balls themselves were nice. Tasted very similar to a falafel ball. I was a fan, but again I wasn't entirely sure that it married perfectly with the rest of the meal.  The atmosphere of the place was a bit lacklustre as well. A bit dingy.  On a really positive note (you'll get why that's funny in a second), the soundtrack they were playing was awesome. Great music for the whole stay.  My buddy ordered \"The Rodfather\" which looked really tasty. Maybe the meat dishes are more impressive! The sides also sounded great, but I was pretty filled from the main dish on its own and didn't order anything else.  To sum it up, the food was pretty good, but I don't think I'll be coming back for seconds."}
{"text":"Not only are the meatballs delicious (and totally addictive!) but the staff at the Leslieville location are incredibly nice.   Twice now they've given me extra portions of something else, when they were all out of the original thing I'd wanted to order. And I come really late at night, after work, so they can't be faulted for being short of something.  And the brussell sprouts are incredible! My new favourite spot for after-work takeout when I'm too tired to cook :)"}
{"text":"Perfection! Loved the rodfather so much & the salad it came with. Perfect amount of food & perfect flavour!"}
{"text":"I loved the meatball sandwiches a lot more than the pasta. Better flavour, more complex. Felt the portions should've been bigger for the price, but it's a good snack."}
{"text":"Just had a Rodfather sandwich.  Delicious.  The bread was toasty and warm and the sauce was finger licking good.  Great spot for a yummy italian sandwich.  Yummy #heymeatball"}
{"text":"- meh - wasn't planning to write a review, but i gots to. - this place is expensive for sandwiches and pasta. tasty, but not really worth it. - i wont be back. sorry, friends."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich shop. Nice and casual. Very friendly staff. Tried to sandwiches and the spaghetti. Shared with friends, of course. Absolutely amazing. And the homemade sodas are great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not a lot has changed. It seems a bit over priced for what it is, an over priced meat ball gourmet sub shop. They claim to buy all their meat products from Rowe farms across the street. Not really a selling feature in my books. Rowe farms is known to be over priced for antibiotic laced products with deceptive signage. I thought they would find themselves but that just doesn't seem to be happening."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch the other day. Definitely not bad at all.   Close to the Distillery District, this place is a quick grab and go joint. There aren't many tables, and the ambiance is definitely not for a date, but it makes a good stop for a fast lunch. The decor is simple, mason jars, cafeteria style tables.   I ordered the Rodfather, it came with three large pork meatballs on a toasted bun with marinara sauce. The side salad is very tasty with a nice light vinegarette.   The price is a little steep (a popular subway chain is cheaper), but the meatballs are homemade and the salad is very fresh. Definitely worth it given the amount of food you get.   Special note: don't take your coworkers here. It's hard not to get sauce on your face since the portions are huge."}
{"text":"After seeing Hey Meatball on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, I knew I had to visit. Oddly enough, I previously walked by the place and never thought to try it. They do one thing, and they do it well - actually they do it the best!  I totally love their balls... meat that is.  The restaurant is not what I expected at all. It's on the small side with only about 6-7 tables. When I walked in, the place was in complete chaos with 7-8 young kids running around and screaming. They have toys for the kids to play with - very much a family restaurant. You order at the counter and they call you to pick up your order when it's ready. The meatballs are so &*%$@!# good, the screaming faded away.  I ordered the signature menu item \"The Rodfather\". I initially thought a meatball would largely be the same anywhere, but that is clearly not the case. As soon as you bite into one, you know this is a special place and a special meatball. The meatballs are served in a perfect toasted bun with Garlic butter, delicious in-house tomato sauce and the perfect blend of Italian spices. I seriously considered ordering a second.  The sandwich is served with an excellent side salad featuring lettuce & cauliflower and a delicious dressing. This is no side order... it can stand on its own.  Other dishes include the Mac & Cheese with meatballs, spaghetti and meatballs, meatballs and bread, Chicken meatballs, the burger meatball, Vegan meatballs and Polenta with rib/sausage/pork meatball. That's the entire menu (written on a chalkboard).     I tried their homemade Italian soda which comes in Orange, Lemon and Grapefruit. It's good but a little on the sweet side. I wish they sold other drinks though. I noticed some folks getting drinks from the nearby Subway and bringing them in.  The guy at the counter prepared the food, took orders and cleaned the tables - he did everything. He was incredibly friendly and really put the customers first.   I will be back for sure. Highly recommended.  BK"}
{"text":"\"Heyyyyyy\"....\"Heyyy heyy heyyyy\"....  The sounds are heard loud and clear... walking down College St. at any time of day..passing by serious \"gentlemen/grandpa's\" hanging outside of their fav \"sports bar\"...I cringe...but soon I join in...\"HEYYYY\"....\"HEYY HEYYYY HEYYYY\".....\"HEYYYY MEATBALL!\"...  One word: Homemade Ginger Soda.  If you go to Hey Meatball, order the soda. I don't care if you aren't thirsty. Neither will you. Order it. You're life will be changed.  I went to Hey Meatball with my friend Kent P. He had been there once prior but we were looking for a quick and delish lunch spot along the College St strip and decided on this gem.  Cute spot. Clean. Cafeteria seating in the middle and a few small tables next to the windows. This place is a dream destination for the indecisive (i know from experience)....there were three options on the menu, all of which included meatballs. There was no going wrong here. I ordered the meatball on ciabatta sandwich with a side salad. Kent also ordered the sandwich and salad...but with the Italian Wedding soup to start. To be honest, I thought he was crazy...wasting stomach space on soup when we were about to be given what I assumed, correctly, would be the best meatball sandwich there ever was. Turns out...he made a good move...order the soup too, grab a handful of napkins and just stuff all of that delicious goodness in your mouth. Ciabatta bread was fresh, meatballs were juicy and perfectly spiced...and Rodney the owner made sure to add some love in the form of a personalized pouring of olive oil onto the bread. mmmmmmmm. salad was also great. light vinegarette. delightful.   All in all...my bill was around $16 which was a bit pricy for lunch but worth it for quality meatballs (three big ones) and a kick ass ginger soda.   Moral of story. Check it out with some friends or go alone. Staff are friendly. Brown bag your lunch the day before to avoid the \"i just paid too much for lunch feeling\". HEYYYYYYY...meatball. I have a food crush."}
{"text":"Another great burger during burger week!  (Courtesy of PayPal.)  Pork patty, tomato \"gravy\", mozzarella cheese, pesto, and spicy pickles.  YUM!!!  Amazing staff."}
{"text":"Saw this spot on triple D and sought it out while in Toronto. The food was worth checking out but the meatballs were so so. A tad on the dry side. The sauce was really good. It's the type of place you order at a counter (with no substitutions at all) and find a seat and wait while things are made as ordered. The veggie balls are good."}
{"text":"Friendly service, that's for sure.  The food was a little under-seasoned, both the macaroni and the meatballs.  The chilies were insanely hot.  Like my-mouth-is-on-fire hot.  Just a little dab will do ya..."}
{"text":"I walked in looked at the menu on the chalkboard and everything sounded good...so I asked them what was their most popular menu item.  Without hesitation she answered \"The Rodfather\".  Of coarse I got it because it comes with 3 pork meatballs, pesto, parm, bolo sauce on a ciabatta bun.    When my order was up I was delighted to see it came with a salad.  I came there for meat balls but this salad was pretty good.  The sandwich is a good size and you have to eat it with a knife and fork if you want to save your clothes.  The bread was fresh and lightly grilled, with the perfect density to hold together the meatballs and absorb the sauce without getting overly soggy.  The sauce is light but the pesto picked it up.  The meatballs are tender and juicy and you can taste the garlic...though it could have been bigger.  I got 1 large and 2 small-medium balls.    ***What I really appreciate is that they have minced hot peppers you can add to your food.  There is a light jalapeno and a screaming habanero.  It's nice to control the amount of heat you want.  Overall this is good quality food and served on a real plate without expecting a tip.  (you pay before you get your food.)  I would come back."}
{"text":"Looking for a good meatball sandwich?look no further. This place has that in spades. I love the sores causal set up perfect for a grab and go sandwhich for a quick bite when needing a meat fix. It's right along college streetcar line so you'd be a fool to not pop in atleast once to try one of there many delicious sandwiches!"}
{"text":"My husband and I saw the episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives right before we went to Toronto and knew we HAD to come here; it actually was the only thing we planned about our weekend in Toronto.  The restaurant was about a mile and a half down the road from our hotel so we decided to walk. We knew it would be a long haul but also knew it would be worth it in the end and would make us want it even more. It was also a great way to see some sites on the way there and back.  After our super long walk we finally made it and boy were we happy. We walked in and the smell was equivalent to an orgasm for my nose. I was in heaven. I ordered the Mac  & Cheese meatball and my husband got the Rod Father.... both amazing and incredibly filling.  When you get in you walk towards the back of the restaurant and the menu is to your left as well as things like silverware, napkins and condiments. You then go to the counter and order your food. You put in your name and they will yell it out when you food is ready. They only have homemade sodas there for drinks - fine with me. I got the lemon soda and my husband got the lime... we mixed them to have lemon lime or sprite. Once your name is called you can pick up your food and bring it to a table of your choice and prepare to have your meatball mind blown. My plate was full of mac and cheese with three meatballs on top. The mac and cheese was sooo good and rich but not super thick. I loved all of the cheeses it was made with. The meatballs were really great on their own but even better once I broke them up and started having them in with my bites of mac and cheese. I cleaned my entire plate and wished I was in the privacy of my own home because I probably would have licked the plate clean. My husbands meal was like a meatball sandwich with sauce, pesto and cheese. You seriously can't go wrong with those items. Needless to say, his meal also disappeared very quickly. The only downside to his meal was his own fault. it came with a salad with beets in it -- He doesn't like beets. He tried it but did not really eat it. no big deal though he was already full from his sandwich.   After we finished with our meals we were unsure of what to do with our plates. Some people in the restaurant cleared them and put it on the counter you ordered from and others left theirs on the table. We opted for a mix of both, we ensured our plates were clear but left them on the table. The only downside and the reason why I decided against 5 stars is because the restaurant does cash only. That doesn't work well for two American idiots. We didn't see any ATM's on the way to the restaurant to get any Canadian money and we only had American cash. Thankfully the dollar worth is pretty much the same so they took our American money... They just wouldn't take single dollars which is fine and understandable. Overall, this place was amazing and I will continue to come here when I make an appearance in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday with an old friend. He opted for the Burger Ball while I went with the Polenta.  OMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGG. I love Polenta; when done right it is a creamy wonderful mass of filling goodness. When done badly it is a gummy starch of death. The Hey Meatball version was outstanding. Lots of buttery texture, with parmesan, pesto and 3 nice little meatballs in the center. It was soo good I didn't even need the meatballs.   The only reason that Hey Meatball isn't getting a 4 star rating is the service. I hate to sound like a mean curmudegon. but we were not exactly greeted warmly when we walked in. It was more of a great....here we go again.... Now I've worked (and kinda work) service and understand what the grind is like, but a smile goes a long way. Also making me feel stupid when I ask where I can get water didn't help anything either... Anyway, maybe this old reviewer just needs a thicker skin...   Go... bring cash. and try the Polenta!  (And the tunes they choose to play as background were super eclectic, ranging from Dr John to old school hip-hop)"}
{"text":"I am an east end of Toronto appreciator/resident so I was thrilled when they opened up a location in Leslieville. I had eaten a few times before at the College street location and was excited to learn that Rodfather sandwich was also on the Leslieville location's menu.   It's the best sandwich I have had in Toronto. The meatballs are so juicy and dripping with flavour, but it's the bread and the pesto spread they put on it that make it phenomenal.   I know everyone enjoys the Pumps in that area and their BBQ is solid, but I hope that more people discover this place as a lunch option in Leslieville and it's proximity to Starbucks certainly doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"After a girls night in my friend and I decided to satisfy our hunger by hitting up this spot that I've been wanting to try for 3 years.   It was a slow Sunday night, the staff was friendly, atmosphere and decoration in the space was nice and cozy, a subject for conversation that night.  I ordered the rigatoni main dish while she ordered the spaghetti.  Taste Test: sauce was seasoned well, meatballs were firm yet smooth. Added spice gave it a nice kick, though a little salty. The rigatoni pasta was hard so I sent it back. The staff was friendly and had no problems remaking it. Bringing it out again, the pasta was still hard lol. I ate it anyway since it still tasted great but they could work on that a bit more. As it is thicker than spaghetti, it should be kept in boiling water longer and taste tested before being served.   The spaghetti dish was made right, sauce was fresh and noodles looked homemade."}
{"text":"Hey Meatball is a decent spot to grab a quick bite in Leslieville.  Stopped by here on a whim when in the area and seeing what's near by on Yelp.  Went with the server's recommendation of the rodfather.  This is is essentially pork meatballs with tomato sauce and parm cheese on a bun.  Comes with a nice side salad.  The meatballs were delicious and tender, but not too soft.  I found that there wasn't enough sauce, but it's possible a lot of it may have absorbed into my bun, which was soggy by the time I ate it (I ordered take out).  Overall, yummy.  I'd go back, but I'd think twice whether the extra price ($12 for the sandwich) is worth the extra cost of it being \"gourmet\" over a large subway/mr sub meatball sandwich.  I did see a picture of their pasta + meatballs, which I'd give a try upon my return."}
{"text":"Awesome spot that does a few things and does them well. The chicken meatball sandwich just blows me away. They also have brussel sprouts that are nicely done. I'm not a huge fan of the smokey interior for sitting down to eat, but for a sandwich this good, who cares?"}
{"text":"Best meatball sandwich I've ever had! Amazing homemade sauce.  Awesome spaghetti and meatball plate and delicious homemade sodas.  Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I ate here two weeks ago. The location is close to my house so I used to come in all the time but recently the food has not been great and the people at the cash un friendly. I asked a question about the vegetarian options and could barely get a definitive answer. I didn't want to eat anything to be %100 sure. I dunno, the place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on the show \"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives\" and I was in Toronto for a weekend so I stopped by. The food was great. I had a Rodfather which was beyond delicious - the pesto made the dish worthy and my mom had just bread with meatballs that she also enjoyed. All the ingredients are fresh and the food is made to order. It was very convenient as well - the streetcar stops across the street from the restaurant.  The next time I'm in the T-Dot, I'll make a stop at this place again.  BTW - I think the place is Cash Only."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible food. It's pretty much the equivalent of boiling your own pasta at home and putting canned tomato sauce on top.  Not only that but the spaghetti and meatballs was not even spaghetti. It was clearly linguini- a flat pasta.   Confused why this place gets such high ratings. Terrible."}

Her mother was giving me the stink eye but I politely told her that I should've gotten that. I hope I didn't creep her out.  Anyways, I finally made it here. The place felt rustic and the kitchen was at the back for everyone to see, which I love. I was looking around for a menu and felt a little foolish to find the menu on a huge chalk board on the left. How could I have missed that? Meatball burgers? I'll have one of those please! Should've gotten the speghetti and meatballs. Drinks? On your right by the counter written on a small chalk board. Homemade ginger ale? I'll have that! Should've gotten the lemonade.  The burger came with a side salad, which was surprisingly good. I would've like fries but the salad did balance out my heathy side and junk food side. The burger looked a little small but it was almost a perfect size. It filled me but didn't stuff me. Aside from the combination and portion size, it was delicious! The ginger ale was gooood.  They have food for all you vegetarians and vegans out there so it's not all meat. Oh and it's CASH ONLY. Next time I'm getting the spaghetti and meatballs!"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs spaghettis que j ai pu avoir à Toronto ! Le seul hic était le service, la serveuse semblait dans un mauvais jour et était super froide !  C'est assez plaisant de pouvoir apercevoir les cuisines quand tu attends ton plat. L'attente n'est pas trop longue même quand c'est bondé !"}
{"text":"overall its a good place to grab lunch. However, the price is too high for its quality. Meatballs are too salty and pastas are mediocre. I always get their salads only. They have really good salads. I would give it a 4 if the average price drops down 15% and less salt on the meatballs."}
{"text":"I find this place and it's other location on College a bit pricey. It's meatballs, and you only get a few. Don't get me wrong, they are really tasty, but not really like $12-15 tasty.   This location has it's menu on this chalkboard that hasn't been erased properly and therefore really busy and hard to read. Took me a while to find something that wasn't a sandwich that I wanted to eat.   Meatballs offered included vegan, beef, pork or chicken. I wanted to get it with gluten free pasta, but at 12pm on a thursday afternoon, they didn't have it. The only thing I could get was with polenta. It was what I expected, just some yellow mush - but paired with a great tasting tomato based sauce and 4 big beef balls it was pretty filling and tasty.   They only take cash unfortunately."}
{"text":"Heard from a co-worker that this is the place feature in Diners drive-ins and Dive with Guy Fieri not long ago.  We were there for a business trip, saw it and went in.  I must say, the Food is sooooooo good.  Drinks are homemade as well... worth for repeat trips."}
{"text":"Stop 3 on #AdasFoodCrawl  I have to say that our stop here wasn't a true taste of their food offerings. We were already stuffed with everything from our last two stops, wasn't sure we were able to eat anything else at the moment.   We opted for the $7 3 meat balls and sauce/toast to split between 8 people. It was the best meat ball I've ever tasted, and I need to go back to get me some more (or something else).   This was a teaser for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for takeout as was in the area.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs (comes with three and cheese) and also got another three to add on - no cheese.  It was for myself and my fiancé - I wanted something small.   Takeout was fast and piping hot.  I got three pork and three beef to share.  The meatballs were great - flavourful and melt in your mouth. I like both of them and fiancé liked the beef. The beef had a middle eastern flare to it.   I was impressed with the meatballs as they were flavourful and not oversalty as some can be! The spaghetti was okay - nothing spectacular and the sauce was tomato - again nothing spectacular but probably a smart move as to not to overpower their star menu item! One star docked for price - a bit pricey - spaghetti - one serving size and 6 meatballs - $19.  It would only feed one person.  It was okay for us two but I wasn't that hungry that day. I would probably go back if I was craving meatballs!"}
{"text":"They're calling me, so the meatballs must be better than I expect it to be... right? Well, it they're not.  I had their smashed meatball burger. It was like a Big Mac minus the extra bun in the middle. The sauce, lettuce, pickles, and meatballs build a gourmet version of the sandwich we all love to hate. It was hard to hold,therefore, hard to eat and pretty messy. On the side, a good well-dressed salad.   The Ginger Soda I heard all about here on Yelp didn't *meat* my expectations either. It's fresh, spicy, but too watery for my taste. I prefer it to be slightly sweeter, but that aside, it was too light in flavours.  I also sampled the meatballs in rabbit gravy with mashed potatoes. I liked this dish better, it was homey and comfort food-esque with a twist. Flavours were on point and the meatballs were tender.  My only gripe was the prices for the portions. They were good dishes but the price didn't justify the experience, ambience, and service I had. They make a good meatball, but I'd opt out for meatloaf at a diner almost anyday."}
{"text":"After seeing it on Diners Drive-Ins & Dives I couldn't stop thinking about those chicken balls. Everything looked so good so we stopped by while we were in the area a while ago.  We got there and it didn't smell clean... We ordered anyway (how bad could it be?) but it was just a really disappointing experience overall. The food was barely ok. We left regretting not eating with our family at the diner across the street."}
{"text":"This place accidentally served me meat and I am a vegan (I had ordered their vegan beanball sub), on a night when there were literally two people including me in the restaurant.  So yeah, won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this spot on Labour day..and it was open! So they get one star on that end. When we called to see if they were open the response we got made us smile. We were told they close \"At 9:59 and 59 seconds!\" Now that is a fun response!  Alright now onto the actual place! First, the atmosphere was alright. You order at the register and then go sit down and wait for them to call your name. Now that was my favourite part! They yell \"Hey (insert name)\" Now that just adds to the experience and to the name of the place!   Secondly, the food was very flavourful! We had ordered the famous \"Rodfather\" and \"Burger Ball.\" The sandwiches were a good size and very filling! We also ordered the 3 meatballs and bread. One word: Awesome! The flavour profiles were there and even a balance of flavours. Acidic, sweet and salty. Perfecto! The one downfall? The homemade sauce was watery on the meatballs. That is the reason for the loss of a star.  Would I return to this joint? Absolutely! I do recommend it to anyone wanting to try a little hole in the wall place! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Hey Meatball! Is a magical mythical place where the food is delicious, locally made (down to the handmade pasta) and is extremely affordable. I've tried everything in their menu and not one dish disappoints. Hey Meatball is my first stop on days that I feel homesick and crave a home cooked meal made from fresh ingredients.   If it is your first time, go with the spaghetti and meatballs. On your second visit try the Rodfather a pesto loaded meatball sub good enough to keep the mob happy. Then venture into the rest of the menu upon your next return (and you will, trust.)  The side salad is rustic, loaded with a flavorful medley of seasonal veggies so tasty even veggie-phobic kids will devour it to the last chunk of celery.   I truly can't say enough about this spot, just go already!"}
{"text":"Great flavour to the spaghetti and meatballs, although I found the meatballs could've been a little hotter but other than that...fantastic !"}
{"text":"Food was awesome and very friendly staff. We were in town for the weekend and they gave us different locations to go to for a good time. The atmosphere of it is really nothing to speak of it's fairly small inside, but the food makes up for all of that. If you are in town stop by little Italy and try hey meatball. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Last night I had a craving for Spaghetti and Meatballs. Hey Meatball came up a few times when I was trying to find place to go to.  Now I live near Mt. Pleasant and Eglinton, so this was a bit of a hike. But I am glad I went and I will defiantly go back.  Place is simple. Gives a feel of a canteen/restaurant for those who have seen some of the developing parts of the world. I liked it.  Fellas working the counter/kitchen are friendly. Meal was ready in a reasonable amount of time. Good portion size and yes, tasty.   Worth a visit."}
{"text":"After 3 different visits, I was FINALLY able to have a meal at the recently opened Hey Meatball in my 'hood (Leslieville).  I was annoyed the first two times by the fact that they ONLY accept cash - no debit, credit or anything of that sort.  Makes me wonder why they have that sweet iPad as a cash register in the front....   With those annoyances out of the way, this was the first time I've ordered spaghetti and meatballs, like ever. At $12 for a plate full of meatballs and spaghetti drizzled with olive oil I expected to be full, and full you will be upon finishing.  It really did hit the spot. And this is coming from a dude with an insatiable appetite (for gainz, ya know?).  The meatballs were succulent and around the size of an egg, only more spherical of course. (duh).  If you're ever in Leslieville and happen to have a hankering from some delicious spaghetti and meatballs, Hey Meatball is the place to be.  EDIT: They accept Credit card and Paypal now."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The place looked grungy. My grandmother saw this place on a tv show so she wanted to try it. She god the rodfather and she didn't like how mushy the bread was. I got the spaghetti and meat balls. It was so greasy and I didn't like the meatballs in general. To top off the great experience my grandma got really sick as soon as we got home. Then I got sick about 10 hours after eating at hey meatball, it was also all I ate that day. I would not recommend this place, unless you really like the interior of your bathroom."}
{"text":"I've been coming here weekly for the past year.  I usually grab the Rod-Father Pork Meatball sandwich which is served on an ace bread like loaf. It is then toasted and treated with pesto and a coating of pasta sauce over the meatballs. Most of the time I choose to upgrade to their Caesar salad as it too is amazing and unique. Note- the Caesar salad is a $2 upgrade from the chopped salad which is also great.  Overall I really enjoy my visits to Hey Meatball. Staff are really friendly and you get a fairly healthy meal for not too much cash."}
{"text":"We had:  1) Mac and Cheese w/ Vegetarian meatballs 2) Mushroom Risotto w/ Vegetarian meatballs 3) Brussel Sprouts 4) Brocolli  Like meatballs? Of course you do. Personally, I've always believed that food is best consumed in compressed sphere or cube form. Hey Meatball definitely has the former covered.  There are some easy positives for me to reinforce here: The menu is small but it was still really hard for us to choose because everything sounded delicious. And, of the main courses, the menu delivered. The Mac and Cheese and Risotto were both tasty, and packed with large globes of veggie meat. There was enough food for us to have lunch the next day.   I've seen other reviewers gripe over the prices, and I was skeptical looking at the menu. But, I think they toe the line of reason so whether or not they are overpriced could go either way - yes, it is expensive for an ordinary bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. However, these meatballs are better than ordinary as are the dishes surrounding them. I don't imagine you'll find this caliber of meatball dish at any other restaurant for cheaper but I think the perception shifts because it is self-serve and your food doesn't get hand delivered by a waiter.  The sides, on the other hand, do seem overpriced. They ranged from $4 to $7. And while there was nothing substantially wrong with the dishes flavour-wise, the price is just a touch overboard for boiled brussel sprouts and steamed broccoli. And the combination of expensive sides with the fact that this is essentially a self-serve joint and the main dishes' come close to the threshold of \"over-priced\" keeps HM from a 4-star rating for me. But don't let that scare you off - these balls are good!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent.   We live up the street. My boyfriend is a pasta fiend. We take out from here all the time (ALL THE TIME),  and have eaten in a handful of times. Hey Meatball is a nice, no-fuss weekday meal for $11 each. (My boyfriend likes this place more than I do and in general, is less critical, so you can probably add a star for him.)  Sometimes, Hey Meatball is really good. Tender meatballs and sauce that tastes of tomatoes, or creamy risotto with a great mushroom gravy.    Other times, it's kind of bad. The sauce is flavourless, the noodles overcooked, and the meatballs (I've tried both pork/beef and the chicken) -- always the giveaway of an off-night -- tough. The BF is there so often that he thinks he's identified which chef is at fault, as they have a rotation. The risotto might be undercooked, or too salty. In the past, they've offered tomato sauce, then mushroom gravy, then ... nothing (?)  with the risotto.   This is what really kills Hey Meatball. If they can nail the quality, they'd be much better. Their service is totally minimal, as it's mostly cafeteria style, but OK (but since there's always one person on cash, if they're busy, you'll probably have to ask about your soda, which is kind of annoying, but ... whatever). Their atmosphere is no-frills, but clean, with a little character, and a good amount of seating for a small place.   This would be a great place for friends to have a very casual and simple meal on a rainy day, but I wouldn't bring people here because it just can't nail the quality."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly service. It is rich food so I only come here as a treat but it had been consistently delicious. Home made hot sauces here are a great thing."}
{"text":"Great location with large tables for big groups, always a fan of the self serve free water.   I've tried the various sandwhiches and pasta and everythign is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Rodfather and a home made cream soda. I left full, sastisfied, but not necessarily impressed.  While the pesto was an interesting additive, the sauce was very bland otherwise, and also made an overwhelming soaking mess of the ciabatta bun, which fell apart in my hands about halfway through.  I will admit the meatballs were quite good though. Perhaps less sauce and more cheese would've balanced things out a bit more, and with some hot peppers or something to give the sandwich some zang... But in the mean time as it is, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Dat's a deeelicious meeeatball!   Loved everything about this little joint in Little Italy. My partner and I shared two entrees: the Rodfather (three pork and beef meatballs in a bolognese sauce in a sandwich), and the meatballs with ribs, sausage, and polenta. Both were excellent -- the meatballs were tender and perfectly cooked; the polenta was creamy and slightly sweet. I even dug the salad accompanying the sandwich -- it was fresh and green, and not your typical afterthought salad that you find at so many other places. Definitely try the house-made sodas, too -- I had the blood orange, which wasn't overly sweet.   The guys working there are pretty cool, too. And they played Morrissey. So there's that. How could you not love it?  I'm totally going back. A lot. I may resemble a meatball fairly soon, but I'll take it. :)"}
{"text":"Fits right in on Queen East beside Starbucks at Logan. Real food prepared and served with a smile by the 'eager to please' staff. The Rodfather is an amazing sandwich even if my bun disintegrated under the load of the juicy meatballs. The side salad is fresh and zesty. Homemade soda is a unique not-too-sweet accompaniment. More fizz would have made it more soda-like though."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to going here for a while.  I'll be back but with caution, the place has promise but my first visit didn't go well. A restaurant devoted to the meatball deserves my business, we'll find a way to make it work.  Also -- it's cash only, ok?  I had the Rodfather and the cream soda. The Rodfather comes with a salad, kind of a coleslaw variation.  It's too much food for one person, even for a meatball sandwich lover, like me -- I suggest that you split it with someone.  I tried to eat the whole thing, failed, and I'm a big guy.  The Rodfather too salty, the salad was too sweet and the cream soda was too vanilla-ly, not sufficiently soda-y and also too sweet.  Maybe I was in a bad mood.  Also, what's with the pesto in the Rodfather?  Meatball subs don't need pesto, why mess with perfection?  On the positive side, the meatballs were fantastic and the staff are friendly but not clingy.  Also, no cheese on the sub, what a relief!  There's a \"meatball + bread\" option that's only $7 (compared with the $12 Rodfather), that's what I'm going to try next time.  And I'm going to give the sodas another chance too since they seem so proud of them."}
{"text":"This was the first place I went on my Toronto trip, and this meal kicked it off very well!  I got the Rodfaher sandwich with a rhubarb soda.  The meatballs were delectable and the bread was crispy and chewy.  My soda was really good, but the ginger soda my friend got was better.  I was really shocked it was so empty on a Friday night.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Whooaaaaa..... The hot summer sun is about to set But I haven't eaten yet I need something good to soothe my head Something that will turn my blue heart to red  Hey Meatball, Meatball, give me the news I've got a bad case of wantin' you Nothing else is gonna cure my ill I've got a bad case of cravin' you  Whether it be vegan or meaty meat in thy balls  I learned that, that nothing about you is small Have them mixed with noodles if you dare  Even the yummy side salad you won't want to share.  Hey Meatball, Meatball, give me the news I've got a bad case of wantin' you Nothing else is gonna cure my ill I've got a bad case of cravin' you Whooaaa  I know you'll like it, so head down to the College street shop. There should be lines out the door, lines that don't stop?  The homemade Ginger soda sure has some zip Smiles on my face as 'The RodFather' touches my lips Shake my fist, knock on wood I've got it bad, and they serve it up good  Hey Meatball, Meatball, give me the news I've got a bad case of wantin' you Nothing else is gonna cure my ill I've got a bad case of cravin' you"}
{"text":"The Rodfather kicks ass plain and simple. This is the best meatball sandwich you'll have. They are dressed perfectly and the roll is a perfect vehicle. Adding some of their homemade habanero sauce just brings it to the next level.   They raised their prices recently but I still think it is decent value. The side salad is substantial and actual uses a good blend of quality veggies with tasty dressing; not just some lettuce and tomatoes tossed together.  I also appreciate they give you a big bottle of free water with the meal rather than try to scam for extra sales on overpriced bottled water.   The service is quick and friendly. I make a point to go here whenever I am in the area which says something considering the lunch/sandwich options in and around Little Italy."}
{"text":"I went back recently and got the veggie balls and risotto again, this time the veggie balls were soooo much better!!! Like night and day. Moist and perfect. The soda was also amazing and the servers were super friendly and helpful. The only thing that would make this place better would be if they offered a cheese sauce. It would change everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti or the Rodfather such a difficult choice. I ended up going with the Rodfather which are 3 pork meatballs served on a ciabatta bun with a side of salad. I really enjoyed the salad and actually finished it before I even touched the sandwich. The pork meatball and the sandwich overall were good as well.   I also tried some of the rigatoni and beef meatball. The pasta was average and the beef meatball was kind of dry. Definitely prefer the pork option.  Overall a decent place and I wouldn't mind coming back to try the spaghetti next time."}
{"text":"I'm proud to say that I\"m not Italian but I make a pretty good meatball sub with my own tomato sauce made from scratch.    However, I must bow in the greatness of \"Hey Meatball!\" located at College and Ossington.  The Rodfather is their version of a meatball sub and I have to admit that it's the very best meatball sub that I've ever had.  I want to entice yout to try it because for me describing it would be like trying to describe the Northern Lights.  (Yes this is a tad bit dramatic but you get the point.)  The parsley salad is a great refreshing compliment to the richness of the actual sub.  Super-friendly and un-pretentious staff made this a joy to commute to!  The only reason I don't give it a fifth star is due to the 80's and 90's hard rock.  There's only so much White Snake, Def Leppard and Motley Crue I can handle.  :)  Seriously fellow yelpers, go and enjoy a real treat in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"I first tried it at Pride where they had a stand last year. We were so stuffed but it was the last stall on the way back to my apartment and what sold me was their sauces. They had some garlic aioli and some spicy sauce, both literally MADE the sandwich for me. The meatballs are perfectly cooked though, not tough and have great consistency. Easily one of the best meatball I've had.  I have been here 3 or 4 times since and have only got one thing because it's amazing!! The meatball with polenta is seriously soo sooo good. So creamy, tasty, meaty and rich. Basically my favourite things all in one plate. At first glance the portion doesn't look big but it is tough to finish, jk it's so good your mind will say yes but your body will say no. Just give in.   My friend's have had the veggie meatball, it's not good, don't get it. Also the sandwich is pretty good, but nothing special. I'm sure this place would be more popular if their prices were just SLIGHTLY better. However I thought 11 bucks for my plate of polenta was very good. The home-made sodas are quite good too. Not much variety in the menu but whatever, I always get the same thing anyways.   Would I return? Yes, preferably baked."}
{"text":"Hey Meatball! It's-a me, Steve-o.  I keep passing by this place over the past week and wondered what the heck?? Then one day saw the door was open, and my stomach was growling. Naturally like anyone with a growling stomach and high sense of curiosity, I entered this den of the unknown. Turns out it was their second day of operation in the east end, and already they were attracting a steady stream of young lunchgoers.  Hey Meatball is a place I once heard of somewhere, but it must have slipped my mind about their popular west end eatery. Whatever; they're here in my 'hood and I am too lazy to march past Yonge, so I'll let the food make the proper introduction, figure out the rest later.  There's room for a few plenty to eat in at this chilled-out diner-style, cafeteria-service restaurant, where you wait for your name to be called to pick up your order. Overhead chalkboard menu with limited (at the time) options had me agonizing over the interesting idea of mac and cheese with meatballs.  Instead I picked the rigatoni pasta (also $12). Great flavourful smattering of sauce, cherry tomatoes and spinach. And the meatballs? Hey! They're quite big and tender and much like homemade good, as it should. It's hard to believe--and it blows my mind to a tomato paste-y mess--that this amazingly quality meal is fast food (SLOW fast food, really), so I'm conflicted about whether or not their good stuff is pricey (they do offer a kids portion). In reference to a Kitchen Nightmares episode, they ought to have someone stand outside screaming, \"We have homemade meatballs!\"... or maybe not.  The two guys manning the fort (one of whom is the owner/chef Rodney Bowers at the time of my visit) are very friendly, informative, and full of rad attitude, that it makes this new welcomed addition to Leslieville-land stand out just by their presence. I will be sure to try the famed Rodfather sandwich and homemade sodas the next time around."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Came in 20 min before closing and everyone welcomed us in showed us all the different  things on the menu and helped us order. Would definitely come back here. Best mac and cheese in the city."}
{"text":"Had a craving for meatballs so I drove to College Street to pick up an order of meatballs... tried the pork/beef meatballs in a home-made tomato sauce... not the best meatball I've ever had, but definitely thought it was good... would go back again..  .. Cheers...."}
{"text":"Simply put; the meatball sandwich w side salad is fantastic.  I don't know about the other location (yet) on Roncy but this was the original and I remember going in the first week they opened w 2 younger kids, owners couldn't be cooler and it was one of those 'memorable' meals...  Not cheap though, worth it, but pricey enough i don't go as much as i'd like.."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the first thing that attracted me to Hey Meatball was the fun name. Second thing was the cartoon talk bubble sign on the window. Clearly, I'm a sucker for good \"packaging\". I had the Rodfather. All kinds of amazing meatballs happening here, toppings are great as well. The *only* downside was the stale bread. Total outcome was great once I removed the top and ate it as an open face sandwich. Needless to say, fork and knife were required. Would definitely go back to try another sandwich."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and the salad was delicious...  Sandwich broke apart... but that's due to the sauciness... the delicious delicious sauciness.... Mmmmmm..  can't wait to go back...  The location is cute... open concept... nice to see the inner workings of a restaurant kitchen... very cozy place... first time there and i felt so welcome and at home... :)"}
{"text":"I kind of randomly went in here when it started pouring rain and I was on my way home. I had the Mac and Cheese with pork meatballs. A phenomenal meal but wayyy too much food for 3pm in the afternoon."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to check out Hey Meatball out for quite awhile but never seemed to make it there. So the other evening when my GF suggested it we decided to go. I could kick myself for not going earlier. The food was delicious - filling hot comfort food on a cold day. Staff was friendly and didn't mind my 20 questions. I had chicken meatballs w/mashed potatoes and she had the meatball sandwich. Delicious. I'll definitely be going there again!!!"}
{"text":"So I am from out of town a little place called California. Actually probably one of the best places in the world but that is another story. So I was visiting Toronto and decided to find something delicious to eat. I was staying downtown and walked about 1.5 miles to this spot because I am cheap and I do not believe in taxis. I got to this spot and was debating between the mac n cheese meatballs and the chicken meatballs with mashed potatoes and gravy. One of the guys working there recommended that I try the mac and cheese with pork meatballs. Anyways, man did he not disappoint. That bowl of glorious heavenly mixture of cheeses and meats was on point aka it was delicious. I was in toronto for like 3 or 4 days I think I blacked out on one of those days because it was that good. It was the best meal I had that whole trip and I wish I went back again."}
{"text":"I tried Hey Meatball for the first time for lunch yesterday. Overall I was very impressed. My fiancé and I decided to get two meatball sandwiches and split them. We tried the Rodfather (pork meatballs) and the vegan meatballs because we both usually really appreciate a good veggie meatball. These veggie meatballs were lentil and sweet potato based (there were some other stuff too that I can't remember).  Both sandwiches were fairly large in size and came with a side tossed salad. The pork meatballs were delicious, the sandwich was fantastic. The vegan meatball sandwich was also quite tasty but they definitely weren't the best veggie meatballs I've had. I guess I prefer eggplant veggie meatballs but that may be a personal preference. I probably wouldn't get these again but that's more a testament to how good the regular meatballs were.   The extras: The salad was also good. It had a lot of pickled veggies on it which I found a bit overpowering but my fiancé really loved it.   By far my favourite thing was their hot sauce. Two different types both really good!  I really enjoyed Hey Meatball. It's a bit too heavy to eat on a regular basis but it was super tasty and ill eat there again when I feel like a bit of a hefty Italian indulgence."}
{"text":"I brought my dad to this place, and I cannot stress enough how picky of a diner he is. ESPECIALLY when it comes to Italian food. He makes his own meatballs and sauce at home and I'm usually afraid to bring him out because he is so open with his distaste, and often sends things back.  He had the spaghetti with meatballs ribs and sausage and he was blown away at how good it was. I had the Rodfather and loved it too. We were both really full after, I'm actually really surprised that there are other reviews about the size being too small.  The salad that came with the sandwich was awesome, it wasn't your basic garden salad, it had kale and what i think were homemade pickled radishes? Anyway it was great, I might even go back just to get that salad. Another thing that will get me to go back is the homemade soda!!! it's awesome and made with REAL ingredients (i.e. the gingerale had actual pieces of ginger).  Most importantly, the staff is really genuinely nice and attentive. No matter how good the food is, if people are rude, I will never go back.   I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a really good, reasonably priced home-made meal.  Cost for 2 people: 29$"}
{"text":"It was very good.  Even the salad had some great dressing on it that complimented the sandwich.  Home made soda was a nice touch.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Went couple weeks ago.  Price value very good.  Tasted very good.  Not sure if they had AC since they opened the doors & there were some flies flying around (not a lot But still a little bothersome).  Food was amazing though.  Nice small menu.  Don't forget to order their homemade drinks!  It's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I don't do review updates often, but I've just gotta upgrade these guys to a five star. They're just that good.  The Rodfather & salad combo I got tonight was out-of-this-world.  The salad consisted of pickled radish and beets (SO insanely good), various lettuces including what I think was Swiss chard, cucumber and red peppers. The folks at Hey Meatball must have read my previous review and taken notes because it wasn't overly acidic at all this time. And the Rodfather was perfect. The meatballs actually melted in my mouth -- have you ever had a meatball melt in your mouth?!! Man oh man.   For those commenting on the price factor, most mains are $13 - tax included. That's only $11.50 before tax which is pretty reasonable for one of the best salads and meatball sandwiches you'll probably ever eat in your life.   Absolutely no complaints!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Friday after a long, traffic filled drive. I told Brad that the only thing I want to eat is comfort food. Hey Meatball was just what I wanted.  The food was wonderful! I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and Brad ordered the Rodfather. The sauce and meatballs had a great spice. Brad said the Rodfather was great too. I really wanted to come back Saturday night too, but Brad shot that down.  The service was super! The cashier knew we were from out of town and actually gave us a list of places and bars to go to. It was very helpful. If I could, I would give the service 6 stars.  I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Hey Meatball! is quite the place, but stops short of being amazing. Here are the great, good, and not-so good points of the place.  1. The salad that is served with the RodFather sandwich is amazing. In fact, it outshines the sandwich. It is a brilliant mix of fresh greens and veggies. 2. The sandwich has three average sized meatballs that have average meatball flavour. There is more bread than meat with the sandwich. The bread tastes very fresh. 3. The sandwich and salad is 12$ including tax. It is not cheap, but the salad saves it from feeling too expensive. 4. Eat in. If you take a meatball sandwich home, it will be mushy by the time you get there. 5. They are cash only. This is a bit frustrating (I had to trek two blocks in the snow to the ATM). While it probably saves them some money, it probably prevents them from getting some larger orders and catering-sized orders.  This is definitely worth trying. It would be interesting to know how it compares to the similarly sized meatball sub at Subway next door."}
{"text":"That was a nightmare. The meatballs were cold and hard. The pasta was literally DOUGHY.. Not even over cooked but actually tasted like dough. It came in a big ball like it came right out of the fridge or something as opposed to fresh. Not to mention it didn't agree with my stomach at all and I went to the bathroom soon after we ate there. For a restaurant that I saw on the Food Network, I'm pissed. Oh and definitely not worth $12."}
{"text":"I had the Three Meatballs with bread and it was delicious! I'd love to go back and try one of their sandwiches  Service was very quick"}
{"text":"I give this place a full 5 stars for a few reasons. First, the lady behind the counter is extremely friendly and welcoming. Second, the choices meet picky people (i.e. gluten-free, vege meatballs, etc...). Next, ALL the meat comes from Rowe Farms and the pasta is fresh!! They also have filtered water and not gross tap water. The price seemed completely reasonable $13 for spaghetti and meatballs, taxes in. Lastly, you can tip if you want to, but because it is not a table service restaurant (aka you receive the food at the counter), it keeps the bill reasonable. Lastly, and most importantly, the pork meatball I got was TO DIE FOR! I loved it so much, and the portion was very generous! This place seriously rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Had spaghetti with three meatballs. Take-out portions fill the average take out box for an order of fries, which means to me having to order twice, which means $24 for dinner for one. Meatballs were not cooked to order, having a slightly hard edge on them. Pasta and sauce were good. Although they just opened, I could not get a plastic fork with my plastic knife, so they offered me a spoon. A SPOON. thanks!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Hey Meatball for pick up a couple weeks ago and overall it was a good experience.  The service was pretty good and the food was tasty.  We had the meatball sandwich was great (as most meatball sandwiches are) and the spaghetti and meatballs which was very good but also very small.  You'd think that when your paying $14 for take out spaghetti you'd get a health helping of noddles.  If they up the portion size a bit we'll make it a regular stop!"}
{"text":"The Rodfather is a really great sandwich. I was a little distracted by the fact that I felt obliged to say \"Hey\" to all the meatballs. It made me feel like we were friends. The sandwich was delicious despite the fact that I hit it off with a few of the meatballs.   Instant connection with the salad. Currently married with 3 kids (baby tomatoes) with the salad. Don't try the salad. She's mine. We're married."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best meatball sandwich I've ever had. I really didn't have huge expectations of a meatball sandwich. Who does? I had the Rodfather. Tender slightly spicy meatballs, red sauce, fresh shaved parm & pesto on a fresh bun; it was incredible! The side salad was a little over dressed but very nice and crunchy with lots of different, colourful veggies."}
{"text":"A tasty meatball sandwich!  I ordered The Rodfather, a messy but tasty pork-and-beef sandwich that came highly recommended. I managed to not make a mess of it by cutting it in half and slowly eating every morsel to savour it the bolognese sauce. It's definitely a good sandwich and the salad that came with it was equally good. No ugly, mushy leaves were found nor left on my plate.   The mac n cheese meatball plate looked good too. It tasted good. I'll order that next time.    I also really enjoyed the sodas. I ordered the pressed apple which was gingery and cider-like but the cream soda was definitely one I need to get next time. Anything with a cream soda flavour I love.   Hey Meatball, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I THINK I'm a fan. Looking forward to them completing their proper vision of the place, with a proper menu and liquor licence so that I can have a proper experience here. Still, if you're only going to have 3 menu items scrawled on a chalboard, and one of them is a meatball sandwich, it better be a freakin' delicious sandwich - and it really, really was.  It was a beautiful Thanksgiving weekend and the missus and I were doing our last patio crawl of the season. Having made our way towards College, I suggested we try Hey! Meatball! as I was incredibly curious, and the missus had yet to visit Little Italy (I know right?!).  For some reason, I truly believed there would simply be a steam table filled with heaps of meatballs, and various sauces and sides, and you would just build your plate. No, you order, pay, and then sit and wait with your number. So we did.   The sandwich came with a salad that was absolutely delicious, so much so that we devoured it first, before the sandwich! And the meatball sandwich, a blend of pork and beef with a perfect amount of sauce, was VERY easy to eat. Took about 15 minutes or so to be ready - and we noticed the time because we had just walked from Queen and it was HOT in the restaurant - but was worth every bite.   On the other hand, the water we asked for was off, maybe it was a free sample of this homemade ginger ale people are talking about, but we left it.   Nice, clean, new washroom in the basement and a great location. Can't wait until the menu expansion!"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon.  This was my second time going to Hey Meatball and the first time was a year ago after watching a segment of You Gotta Eat Here Canada.  When we went in and it was pretty empty.  Only one patron was finishing off their food and left quickly afterward.  We ordered a spaghetti and a rigatoni.  $12/each.  The place was quiet and we had the whole place to ourselves.  The only thing that was going on were the cooks and the trance-ish music in the backround.  Our name was called and we brought the plates back to our table.  It looked splendid and did it ever taste great too.  My wife found her spaghetti a little bit too saucy but I really enjoyed my rigatoni.  It had the amazing combination of al dente and freshness of the pasta.  Loved it!  The meatballs (pretty much kafta pork) were decent but nothing truly to die for.  It is such a complete tasting meal.  The only thing missing from the dishes was that ours did not really have any grated parmesan cheese as we had in the past.  After we were pretty much done with the meal, only then we remembered the cheese!  I would definitely return back and of course, during off time hours to not be with the crowd and maybe something else from the menu."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing this on DDD (yeah I know). I'm not sure exactly how it made it onto that show, it seems that this place is beyond what would be typical of DDD. I have been to this place twice already. I have only had the Rod Father and Spaghetti w/ Meat Balls. I love the salad that came with the Rod Father, it had such a fresh taste that reminded me of a summer day. The bread was fresh, the sandwich was moist and delicious. I think if it did not have the pesto, it would be just another meatball sandwich. The spaghetti is a pretty simple dish, but the fresh pasta puts it above most other places I've tried. The sauce is pretty basic and very good. The only thing I would ask for is a massive self serve bowl of grated Parmesan cheese. I will be back again.  Just remember that this place is CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise discovery after a failed attempt to patronize fish store and sandwiches. Looks like they had a fire or something. they and the adjacent shawarma place were \"Closed for renovations\".   Anywho, I ordered the rodfather. Basically a meatball parm with pesto. It comes with a slightly unconventional side salad avec cauliflower and misc other rooty and dark vegetables - pretty nice. But I digress from the meatballs. The sandwich was fantastic. One of the best meatball sandwiches i've ever had (though I do need to confess I have not had that many in my lifetime). The cash-only aspect of things was mildly annoying, but there is a CIBC only a block away.  As a side note, the table hot sauce they have for condiment is pretty good. It's a tomatiilo-based sauce. More or less a standard verde, but a little chunkier. We were warned it was very spicy, but it was relatively mild. Had a nice kick though.  Would have liked wetnaps afterwards. Tis messy."}
{"text":"The stuff was very patient with me . I was trying to pay with PayPal and didn't work for 5 minutes and only then I realized I need to swipe otherwise the system won't find me . (I really love paying with PayPal it's neat ,  hopefully they would sign more retails in the near future)  I went in for late lunch not feel anything heavy so I got meatball 3pc' with tomato sauces and some Parmesan cheese. Also get some toasted garlic bread in the side.  There are three options which are beef , chicken and pork .  I went with beef meatballs . It was OMG dry its as if it was all lean beef and there are some herbs parsley and other seasonings .  Okay my ideal meatball is juicy tender and flavorful . Dry and not seasoned well not fond of it , the tomato sauce taste nothing special I added quite a bit of grounded black pepper so it won't taste so plain . It was ciabatta bread sliced toasted with garlic oil artisan bread I guess they source it out in a close by bakery . I tried very hard to finish my meal ...sorry to say .   There are also spaghetti and sandwiches I think those might be good . Might give it another try some time. It's definitely kids friendly most kids I know love spaghetti meatballs I think they like the idea of it sounds fun looks fun could always picture a kids with tomato sauce on his mouth funny looking one ."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on Diners-Drive In's & Dives so I decided to make the trip to have a lunch.   I arrived at the time period & there was only 4 people in the dining area. I made the 5th.   The food was average. I ordered the Meatball Sammy with the Donair sauce. Also added the salad that I don't recall being on the menu so it was a nice surprise. The Sammy was just average. It didn't have lots of flavour & it was served on a Ciabetta Bun that was toasted. I find these types of buns hard & rough on the mouth. All things considered it's just an average sandwich from an average restaurant. Nothing really stuck you for me & to my thoughts likely didn't really earl all the accolade that \"TRIPLE D\" delivered for it. I wish them success. One thing that I noticed....older building in the older section of Toronto."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers during burger week, spicy but not uncomfortably so, the pesto rich, and the patty juicy.   Unlike Hogtown Smoke where they laughed at us when informing the line of over 10-15 people that they don't have any burgers (no apologies) this place was well stocked, and the cast of characters at the restaurant incredibly friendly. I will not hesitate to bring my friends here in the future."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good enough - sort of pricey for the basic meal that you get.  Cash only! Lame!"}
{"text":"Unnassuming storefront on Queen Street East with surprisingly good comfort food inside. Well worth the visit. Great meatballs. Nice selection of sides and salads. Homemade sodas are nice, especially the ginger. And the hot sauces are extremely hot - in a good, lingering warmness way."}
{"text":"They make some tasty meatballs here. I would recommend the rodfather (meatball sandwich). On top of making great meatballs, they make homemade gingerale which has some bite (spicy) and is quite yummy. That is if they make it right, as the one time it was a bit off...  The one time I was here, I saw David from season two of Top Chef Canada. He finished third I think. So if it's good enough for a top chef, it should be good enough for you :)"}
{"text":"Well after reading a plethora of reviews on this place it is definitely a solid 3.5.   I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and the hubby got  The Rodfather. Mind you my husband is Indian and I'm a Turkish-American mut. I got the food and headed over to the \"hot\" suace which ended up being more like pickled peppers. I also added loads of pepper and the food was still pretty bland for our liking. However, the side salad was delectable. Nicely chopped veggies and an array of greens. The dressing was refreshing, my favorite part of the meal.  We didn't try the soda, not really our thing."}
{"text":"The place was not very busy on a weekday for lunch. One other group sitting at the communal tables. The place also has an open kitchen so you'll smell like meatballs after you leave.   Had the mac and cheese and the rigatoni. Both were over cooked (read: soft and mushy) and definitely not al dente. It tasted like primo pasta that you'd get from the grocery store. The meat balls itself were not bad but nothing special. The difference in size/price is the number of meatballs you get (2 vs 3). I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were looking so forward to trying this place out, and I am not sure if was the hype, or if I was expecting to be blown away by how great it was, but I was mildly disappointed. We got there at noon on Sunday, and we were the only customers. Many other people were eating at patios on the street, and this place didn't have a patio, so I figured that was why we were the only customers. Guy at the cash was friendly and efficient, took our order- a home made ginger ale, the Rodfather and an East Coaster. Everything was good. Not awesome or wonderful or stellar, but a solid good. The sandwiches came with salad, which was a nice touch and a change from the usual fries. Sandwiches both were fine, price as good-$27 for the whole meal .Ginger ale was very fresh tasting. I am not sure I would go back here, but like I said, not because I wasn't happy with the meal- I just was not ecstatic about it."}
{"text":"This would probably be more like a 3.5.  The meatballs themselves were delicious, the sauce was solid, and there was some sort of delicious garlic butter on the bread that is making my mouth water as I type about it.  My main gripes were the side salad...unlike some of the other posters, I felt like it was just sort of an afterthought with little effort put into it (although it was fresh) and the price.  As many of the other reviewers noted, this restaurant has not hit on the right price point for meatball sandwiches.  I'm downgrading to a 3.  After typing this review, I couldn't stop thinking about how delicious a meatball sandwich would be, even an overpriced one with a lame side salad.  When I went over there (at 2pm), they were closed despite a sign saying they are open every day from 11:30-10.  So annoying."}
{"text":"This place totally changed my conception of meatballs ENTIRELY! I've never been a fan of meatballs because I guess, I've never tried any that impressed me. After trying meatballs at Hey Meatball I\"ve decided that I actually like them, as long as they taste like the ones there. The meatballs there had flavours I've never tasted in any other meatball before, it's really hard to explain, you must try it out for yourself! In addition, they were nice enough to give us complimentary garlic bread!"}
{"text":"Um. Hey! Meatball should be called HALLELUJAH MEATBALL, because in all honesty, this place TOOK ME TO CHURCH. PRAISE THE LORD (and his balls, and I'm talking bout meatballs here, for those of you who are of a depraved mind!).   After waking up suddenly one Saturday Morning and realizing that if I didn't have meatballs THAT DAY, something would go terribly wrong, I made it a point to FINALLY visit hey meatball after spending years passing it a million times on my streetcar trips down College street. I have actually yearned for Hey meatball without really ever giving in for ages, I've sort of always had this unrequited love thing for hey meatball, longingly gazing into its front window, always wondering \"I wonder what goes on in there?\" (meatball magic duh) \"\"I wonder what it's like in there?\" (no frills cafeteria style dining & charmingly grimey)  So yea, Guy Fieri profiled this place a year or 2 ago and I made it a point not to succumb to the charms and advice of a guy who bleaches his goatee (life lesson, it might be okay to trust a guy who bleaches his goatee...) And let me just say, I really really loved my food. A LOTZ. And my boyfriends Burger Ball sammy and pickled salad was a hoot too (delicious hoots).  After perusing through the menu for a few minutes, I settled on the Polenta with 3 pork meatballs, with the polenta being topped with a double whammy of flavor - bolognese sauce AND pesto). After about a 7ish minute wait, my name was called and up we went to collect our food. My dish looked scrumptious, blissfully home made and I was hella excited to dig in. My boyfs dish looked scrumptious too; his pickled salad was colorful, vibrant and his meatball sandwich was HUGE (he had to crush that sucker down to even get his mouth around it). My polenta was sooooo creammmmmmyyyyy, perfect texture and consistency. The pesto was just beautiful, I was like, oh god oh god oh god please dont lets this be TOO good because I am just about ready to scream, and then I put the pesto in my mouth and it was like BAM BASIL FLAVOR EXPLOSION, and then I proceeded to internally scream from wonder for like 2 whole minutes. The bolognese was 2 legit 2 quit that I just wanted to BATHE IN THAT FUCKING SHIT cause uggghhhh, I could honestly marry Hey Meatballs' Bolognese.  So, the meatballs: the meatballs were good. Not perfect (is there truly such a thing as a perfect meatball, I mean, come on, what if god was one of us, eating a meatball on a bus? just trying to find his way back home? What I'm saying is, god would probably throw out his normal meatball...and come to hey meatball)   But really at the end of the day, if you need a good, home style meatball, Hey Meatball is the place to go. The great thing about this spot is that they dont just get lazy with the meatballs, they focus on crafting amazing sides and put together really strong plates of flavorful food that your grammy would make (grammies make the best food and you know it.)"}
{"text":"I live in Little Italy and walked by this place a BILLION times.   After hearing so many positive reviews, my curiousity caught up with me and I finally made my way inside for some balls (Get your mind out of the gutter!) I ordered the Rodfather, and homemade lemon soda.  Truthfully the soda was kinda \"meh\", and it didn't really blow me away.  The sandwich however was quite good.  Now when you think of a sandwich, you picture yourself holding it with both hands as you bite into it.  Not an option with the Rodfather!  The meatballs were huge, and I'm afraid I'd have worn most of the sandwich if I didn't use a knife and fork.  Not an issue for me what-so-ever.  I proceeded to eat this delicious concoction with content, and enjoyed every bite of it.  The meat itself was perfectly textured and seasoned.  The sauce was very good, however I wish there was more of it, and the bread, fresh albeit soggy from all the yummy goodness plopped on it.  If you're looking for a great \"sandwich\" or crave something different, I'd highly recommend this spot.  Just be prepared to loosen your belt a notch or two afterwards! ;)"}
{"text":"Hey! This place is amazing!  Stopped In here for some spaghetti and meatballs with cheese, which sounds pretty basic, but this was no ordinary dish. The dish was seasoned to perfection; bursting with flavors. The meatballs were probably the best I have ever had. They were a tad garlicy which I love. The tomato sauce was nice, flavorful and thick, which complemented the whole dish very well.   Service was friendly, quite fast too. Only one major thing. Cash only. Than we had to walk to the bank than pay $3 to take out some cash. But anyway, it was definitely worth it in the end.   Moreover, I strongly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We had a rodfather and a mint soda.  They were absolutely fantastic and the guys behind the counter were super friendly."}
{"text":"They went the extra mile to make me a vegan meal that was not on the menu. And they made it with love. Even decorated the plate for me. Staff were so kind and atmosphere was friendly."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed sandwich and was pleasantly surprised by the side salad. It had a good variety of fresh veggies and excellent dressing. On a healthier day, I would have been happy to order it as a main dish."}
{"text":"My hubby tried the Bahn Meatball* sandwich and can't stop raving about it!  He says it's: \"The perfect fusion of a Bahm Mi and Meatball sandwich, hitting all the flavours of the Bahn Mi with all the juiciness of a meatball sandwich!  Delicious!\"  He ordered it on a whim when picking up our take out order, and loved it SO MUCH he called back to thank the guy who works there that recommended it as well as the chef who created it.  A must try for those who are looking for a meatier Bahn Mi.  We will be back soon for more... try it soon so they keep it on the menu!    *(I think they should call it the \"Bahn Mi-Ball Sandwich. )"}
{"text":"Hey delicious! I'm so happy I finally checked out Hey Meatball - it's such an adorable spot with a great menu!   I stopped in for lunch, and tried the mac & cheese with meatballs and a home-made grapefruit soda. The mac & cheese was creamy, flavorful, and had that perfect crunchy layer on top - paired with three pork/beef meatballs, it was the perfect (extremely filling) lunch. I also got to try the polenta with three types of meat, also delicious and a huge portion. They also have a selection of home-made dressings for your meal - I tried the ketchup, but it was a little vinegary for my tastes.   While lunch was large and delicious, it was also expensive - $15 for the main and soda. while it's not an every day place, it's definitely worth the occasional splurge!   What I love about Hey Meatball is the awesome decor - it has such a relaxed feel, and is decorated so it looks like it's been there forever (though I know it's relatively new). My absolute favorite part of the decor is their red door with the meatball shaped window - it's so cute!   I can definitely tell there will be future visits to Hey Meatball!"}
{"text":"Working in the area and noticed how busy this little shop was. Tried it out and wasn't disappointed. Had Rod Father sandwich, comes with an excellent light salad. Everything was excellent, cleanliness, two staff members were social and efficient. Both the meatball sandwich and salad were great. Price was right for what you got.  I would go again forsure."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend walked into the place during taste of little Italy event, while we passed by this vintage looking place before, we never had a chance to try the food here.  And we did missed out a lot. Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly staff who help us decide what to try (as we only wanted to tried one dish in the menu). We had the 3 meatballs + bread, which we had 1 pork ball and 2 beef balls.   The pork ball was tender and juice like a ball should. The tomato sauce that it comes with also very flavourful. The beef balls is a bit overdone to my taste as it's a little too chewy, however the flavour is also very good.   Would definitely come back next time to try other dish when we're not so distracted by all other places around here."}
{"text":"Popped in here last night with a friend to grab some comfort food on a chilly, rainy October night.  We both ordered the Rodfather and a side of mac n cheese to split then we grabbed a post at one of the communal tables.  For a Saturday night around 6:30-7ish, the place wasn't too busy, but it was enough to keep the nice dude behind the counter working hard.  I like that he made a point of asking us if we had any questions about the menu before we placed our order at the counter because we did have questions.  Now the food.  The bun of the Rodfather was tasty and I liked the pesto on it.  I also enjoyed the meatballs.  What I wasn't in love with is the minimal cheese on the sandwich; I think something gooey and melty would really take it to the next level.  Also, I had a mild allergic reaction after eating it, so I am wondering if there was MSG in the sauce.  The mac was pretty generic but the sauce had a good consistency.  I enjoyed the pickled onions in the salad and the dressing had a very nice bite to it.  The only real problem with the meal was the front door of the restaurant was propped open which meant that our food got cold super fast and we couldn't really enjoy our meal because we were cold too!   Hey Meatball!  Big up the cheese and close the door and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hey Meatball! Hey home-made tomato sauce! Hey home-made sodas! Hey YUM YUM YUM! I wish there were more restaurants in Toronto like Hey Meatball, where everything is cooked in house, food prices are reasonable and the taste is just delicious. Try spaghetti meatballs and ginger soda, and vegetarians will be delighted by veggie meatball risotto. I don't even need a beer to enjoy food here."}
{"text":"Frik, this place is good. So good... Since the day I was there last, I've been craving it ever since. Hey Meatball has had a way of working itself into a special little place in my heart that will forever hold true..   The meatballs are a huge, plentiful gorgeousness, and what I loved about an italian meatball specialty place is that you have options of meatballs without pork! I am not a pork-eater and it's been a challenge going to Italian restos, craving a great meatball dish, only to find out the beef is mixed with pork. 90/100 times, this is the case, so I was over the moon when I found out Hey Meatball has beef only balls! Words cannot express how happy this made me.  I had the meatball sandwich with a side salad while my beau (also a non-pork eater) had the spaghetti with meatballs. Both were amazingly delicious and a wicked portion. The bread was fresh, so fresh, and the sandwich was a real sandwich... nice-sized portion and no skimpin' out on any of the goods. The salad was also a really nice complement and a perfectly-sized meal at a great price. The spaghetti and meatballs were also delish and a filling portion. The pasta was prepped really well. Not perfectly al dente but pretty darn close. So I give this place an \"A\" for cute ambiance, great food and staff."}
{"text":"Had the vegan meatballs on top of rigatoni with pesto, spinach, and marinara. WOW. Boyfriend had the pork balls and he said they were rocking, meat eaters. Go get these balls."}
{"text":"A-OK.  I just had a \"side\" portion of meatballs (3 meatballs with sauce and bread). $7. It was pretty damn delicious I must admit.   Main meals are a bit pricier ($11-$14 but inclusive of tax). They have some sides mostly prices at $5 each, so bill could be nearly $20 if you're hungry. I thought prices were just a wee bit high, given the very casual atmosphere. It's almost cafeteria-life but seating is a bit more comfortable and cosy than a cafeteria, I suppose.  Hipster staff were friendly and informative about the menu. They were happy to split a spaghetti and meatball portion ($11) in half onto two plates for 2 of my friends to share.   Good place if you're in a rush, food came quick and we were in and out within 20 mins. I would probably not go out of my way to go here, but would stop by again if I was in the hood."}
{"text":"I don't understand how they can justify charging $15 a dish for a self serve, mediocre food, and dirty establishment.  Self serve. The place is small, I don't understand how you can have three people working and not offer service during a non-rush period. For the 40 or so minutes we were there it was a large group, the two of us and one take out order. It won't kill you to drop our food of at the table. Charge $9-10 and whatever, I'll take self serve because at least it makes sense for the price. Also LOVED the guy who took our order like we were interrupting his life.  Mediocre food. We ordered the East Coaster and Polenta. The East Coaster was hella delicious but mostly due to the lovely ciabatta bun. The salad on the plate was inedible. It was completely pickled and not in a good way. I LOVE pickled vegetables and I could barely choke down a green bean. The Polenta was nothing special and overly salted. The meatballs were the worst part. This is a dish anyone could make at home and takes no skill.  Dirty. We sat near their front window. I pulled out my chair and the chair frame was sticky. The window sill was COVERED with midges. We walked across to the cafe and their window sill had a few midges too, but not like at Hey Meatball."}
{"text":"well... it is ok, but my GF makes better pasta with meat balls... I am such a huge fan of the regular Hey! restaurant that I left disappointed from there"}
{"text":"I ordered their appetizer of 3 meatballs and bread, the meatballs were in a good size and their sauce was delicious! I'm glad that it came with 3 pieces of bread, so I could soak up the rest of the sauce and not waste any."}
{"text":"As an indecisive woman who happened not to be hungry on this busy Friday night, i spent a long time wandering in front of the menu sign written in chalk by the counter trying to figure out what I wanted to eat.   Alas, when everyone has made the order and i am the only one left by the counter, the dude at the counter said to me, \"try the vegan burger.\"   I looked at him incredulously, flabbergasted and, frankly,  a bit appalled: \"you are asking me to eat the VEGAN burger at a joint called \"Hey MEATball?\"   He shrugged, \"I'm telling you it's good...come on, YOLO!!!\" \"Did you just say YOLO to me???\" my asian eyes wider than it has ever been. \"YEAH! You only live once, try it!\" \"Ummm......are you VEGAN?\" You can clearly see I'm letting go a little \"Naw..and I think it's really good!\"  And I'm not sure if it was the irony of him suggesting i eat a vegan burger at a place that sells ground up meat, or the fact that he claimed he's not vegan and liked it, or simply that a dude with weird hair, plaid shirt, and giant black frame glasses thought it appropriate to use the word YOLO to an old crusty asian girl, but somewhere along this journey, he managed to sell it to me. I caved and ordered the $5 vegan burger - why not? I wasn't hungry, my five friends are all ordering meat dishes, and, well, you only live once, so i'm gonna have to try my first vegan dish.  He was right, the vegan burger was actually quite good. Quite small, but very tasty. If you're actually hungry, you will need at least two of them to fill you up. One of my friends had the regular burger and he went to get up to get seconds. The YOLO man told my friend there's already another guy waiting with the same name, so he asked my friend if he can use the name \"Lynn\" instead. So when the order came, he loudly called out \"LYNN!!!!\" a million times. I think he was punishing me for my indecisiveness...  I couldn't tell what was in the messy mush I was eating, but it was delicious. I had a bite of the meatball mac n cheese, and the meatball polenta (some type of cornmeal), and they were all good - but i didn't regret my vegan burger.   Thanks YOLO dude, at least one Lynn will be back."}
{"text":"Fresh, casual & tasty.   I'm not really a fan of the small dining area but the food is really good. The people working here are quite friendly. If I'm in the area and hungry, I'd defiantly go back."}
{"text":"It's obvious but their meatballs are delicious!!! I also like how they handmade my cream soda and it was so tasty.  The restaurant was simple and to the point nothing fancy.  The staff was free day and service was fast. Will drop by when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Nice balls. Good texture. Order the Rodfather. Now.  (3.5 STARS)  I've stopped by here a few times for lunch and their Rodfather is easily their tastiest sandwich. Their pork/beef balls are nicely spiced and their sauce is sweet with just the right amount of salt. There's something about the mix that gives it it's unique taste over their \"boring\" all-beef ball. They didn't have their chicken balls available for any of my visits, but it'll be something to try on a return visit.  Between my friend and I though, whilst we both thought that the \"Rodfather\" was probably a witty play on the owner's name and the most famous movies series ever created, we just couldn't help but think it evoked, instead, images of a Freudian-themed bedroom toy. I suppose that whatever (dirty) thoughts you may have on its name, it'll still be some of the tastiest balls you'll put in your mouth.  Additionally, their salad was surprisingly good on each of my visits - the veggies are fresh and the dressing is light and flavourful. Other reviewers have noted that excellent homemade ginger and cream sodas, which I hope to try in the future.  I was speaking to the owner the other day and asking if their chili and tomato sauces on display were for sale. I didn't really get a definitive answer, but I'm hoping they'll reconsider doing so - how great would it be bring their sauce home and dip your own balls in them?!"}
{"text":"I inconveniently happened to stop by Hey Meatball during Easter weekend, when there was some sort of Easter parade that had closed College St. I didn't even know there was an Easter parade, but what I did know was that I was hungry and I wanted some hot vegetarian balls!   I had the mushroom risotto with pesto and veggie balls, which was surprisingly pretty tasty -- what made it even better was the generous heap of hot sauce I added from the condiment bar. The balls were steaming hot and crispy on the outside, but soft and flavourful on the inside. Note that these aren't really veggie \"meatballs\" in the faux meat sense - they're simply good ol' veggie balls.    Perhaps not the nicest of atmospheres; a bit cafeteria-esque with dirty plates still left on tables, self-serve style, and CASH ONLY, but a solid spot to pop in for a hearty lunch washed down with a homemade soda."}
{"text":"Hey Meatball is by far the best spaghetti and meatball place I've been to in a long time! I love that the meat they make their meatballs from comes from Rowe Farms and all their veggies are organic. Their marinara sauce is to die for. Another gem for Leslieville!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why there are so many mediocre reviews here. I went back for lunch and had a great meal.  I ordered the Rodfather sandwich which was very tasty and satisfying. It came with an excellent side salad which had a great mix of veggies and greens (which includes cauliflower and haricots verts). It was lightly dressed with a balsamic vinegette and a nice sprinkling of pickled radishes and onions which made for a perfect tasting salad. I ate the salad all of the salad first because it was so delicious, but I should have ate some of the sandwich as by this time the sauce had made the bottom piece of bread soggy and very messy to eat. Anyways, I found messy foods are almost always the most delicious. I could have wished it would be spicier, or offered some parm and chili flakes to shake on it. The pickled chili condiment which I added to my sandwich wasn't hot at all.  I had their homemade soda which was very refreshing. They had about 8 different flavours and I went with the mint green tea soda, which had a nice fresh mint flavour.  The place is very casual. It's basically an open kitchen with some tables and chairs thrown in the front of the place -- it's a no-frills cafeteria-styled restaurant. The hipster staff was very friendly and courteous and the place played a great mix of 80's new wave music, yes it sounds very cliché especially in this side of town, but I like it!  The lunch was a bit pricey (prices are more you would find in a nicer restaurant), but it was very filling and the portion was large enough to be a dinner (there's no lunch or dinner portions)."}
{"text":"With a name that screams \"hey, meatball,\" lovers of ground up animals would be hard pressed to resist this new spot in Little Italy. This space was formerly a drug store (excuse me, a convenience store that sold contraband) so the transformation is a welcome change: cool grey walls, bright red chairs, slick artwork, a curving marble-topped bar, and a wide open (and I mean wiiiide open) kitchen preparing meats in balled up form.  Heading straight to the back we were greeted by the gregarious owner Rodney. I was drooling as he man-handled tubs of ground beef and pork. Chewing the fat with Rodney, it's clear that restauranting is in his blood. He grew up in restaurants as a kid, and there is a hobby horse in the corner where his little daughter bides her time, hoping one day to inherit the proverbial meat torch. The emphasis here is on local foods, and when they eventually add beer to the menu there sure to be local brews.  The vibe is casual. Rodney would curtly ask customers \"having a sammich?\" as they tried to figure out the menu. Another example: after ordering he asked if we wanted anything to drink. We looked around for options but there weren't any posted. \"Ginger ale?\" There was an \"uh, sure\" kind of moment but we agreed, figuring that was all they had. When he dropped two glasses of house-made soda with generous chunks of fresh ginger floating in the bottom, I couldn't have been more surprised. Talk about under-promising and over-delivering.  Food! The menu is a chalkboard the size of bedsheet, but really only features 2-3 options writ large. I got the penne and meatballs and my DC went for the meatballs on a crispy chibatta bun. My huge plate of pasta was served with a tiny piece of bread, but it's not like I was wanting for food. There was a lot of flavour to the sauce and the meatballs were off the hook. They were the perfect consistency: easy to pull apart and not overcooked, but not overly crumbly either.   They're no debit or credit yet, so bring cash. Once they're tapped up this will be a can't miss spot. Can't wait to see what else they have in store.   Obligatory Title Pun: ROLL on by and have a BALL.  Menu Readability: You'd have to visually impaired to miss it.  Need to mention: A soft-serve ice cream machine portends great things.  What this place teaches me about myself: Ginger ale is palatable when it's made with real ginger."}
{"text":"Finally made it out to Hey Meatball! I was pleasantly surprised by how kid friendly it was, not just in food choices and options but in actually having a play area for the little ones! The food was great (if a LITTLE pricey) and both myself and my son cleaned our plates. Can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Because I just cannot say anything is perfect.   The Robfather is awesome..  Parking sucks and being cash only hurts foreigners...."}
{"text":"I had read the Rodfather was one of the great sandwiches of the world - it is.  Went for lunch with work friends.  Great chalkboard menu, homemade syrups for flavouring sodas and one of the best meatball sandwiches I've had.    Treat yourself to a fun meal, if you want something good and fast check Hey Meatball."}
{"text":"Here for burger week. Although the line was painstakingly slow. The food was well worth the wait.   The burger/sandwich was very tasty.  Pesto and marinara mix was perfect and the bread was just right. A little on the greasy side but still good.  Portions are not large. I probably could have eaten two.  This burger puts California sandwich to shame.   Albeit the prices are on the high side. Hipster type of crowd"}
{"text":"I have never actually made it to Hey Meatball (@TeamHeyMeatball) but after having their Meatball Donair at #AKS here, I decided that I need to make it on of my priority and they just happen to open up a new location at Leslieville recently.  This is what I call a posh fast food/takeout place where you order and pay at the counter with some communal tables.  And to no surprise, Chef Rodney Bower's menu revolt around meatballs.   Since this was a really late lunch for us and we had an early dinner coming up, we only ordered the sandwich and a side to share.  The Rodfather $12 ~ This is their signature sandwich where you get to choose between beef, chicken, pork and vegan meatballs. We went ahead with the beef but would love to try the pork as well next time. ~ There's 4 plump meatballs smothered in house made tomato sauce & a garlicky pesto on a toasted Ciabatta. ~ Let's just say everything was perfect here from the meatball, to the Ciabatta which was perfectly crisp for this messy saucy goodness.    Side of Mac & Cheese $7  Love the pickled peppers & especially the green chili hot sauce.    Verdict : ~ Love it and will definitely be back for more especially the sandwich. ~ Would def have to try their pork meatball as well next time. ~ The place is rather small with an open kitchen, so be prepare to smell like meatball on your way out.... if not, just get takeout."}
{"text":"Legit. I would come back to Canada for this place. Cool staff, chill, quirky atmosphere, and great food.  The chicken meatballs were flavorful, with a chunky, tangy tomato sauce and delicious crispy buttery slices of bread. The root vegetables side was amazing. Out included celery root, carrots, sweet potato...and maybe other stuff...point is...it was roasted perfectly, not too crunchy, not too mushy, with excellent flavoring.  It took us all our power not to come back to the same place before leaving (we have to try other things!). We hope they expand to the US soon!!"}
{"text":"Very solid meatball sandwich.  Not inexpensive ($12) but includes a respectable side salad and free mineral water. Quick and friendly service even though they are still getting set up. Will be back for sure.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had seen this place on Triple D (Diners, Drive-In & Dives for all you newbs), and were taken in by the sumptuous meatballs and fresh pasta that were raved about. We hoped onto the 504 tram and eagerly made our way down College to this little hole in the wall. If it weren't for the red sign, we probably would've missed it. The guy who greeted us and eventually took our order was really friendly and offered us helpful suggestions. Danny and I split a \"Rodfather\" (their signature meatball sandwich) and the Mac'n'Cheese (if you hadn't noticed, I LOOOVE mac'n'cheese). We were suggested the housemade Grapefruit soda, and decided why not! We had pretty high expectations from what we had seen on Triple D and were excited. The Rodfather sandwich was pretty good for my first meatball sandwich, and the mac'n'cheese was decadently cheesy and sinful. The grapefruit soda didn't have much of a taste to it though, which was a little disappointing. It was a great meal, and I would hands down recommend it, but it fell a little short of our high expectations unfortunately."}
{"text":"Meatballs are outstanding, sauce is perfect and the pasta nice and fresh!  I brought my kids here and they want a return trip!  The only thing we weren't to fond of was the soda, I came for the food though and I will be back to try the \"Rodfather\" sandwich!  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Hey Meatball! Evelyn W here.   I hopped off a flight after a whirlwind 36-hour-fun-fest and jumped in a cab at the downtown airport. I needed the internet, I needed to eat and I needed a hug. Is there is a food that can nourish you and make you feel like you're being hugged even if your not? A meatball sub. So \"College and Crawford, please...\" is what I muttered to the cab driver while checking my email. Before I knew it I was waiting for The Rod Father, my fave meatball sub of all time. And Bam! They have free wifi!  Just go and get The Rod Father, and really enjoy the side salad. Top 5 side salads in the city.   PEPPER POINTS for their made in house sodas. This hyper hypo killed a cream soda for the first time in years."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are pretty good. I've gotten better salads from pizza places though. My wedge salad featured a full, uncut head of lettuce. Seriously? Try a little harder, guys. I won't be recommending this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"happy 600th review to me!  I've been wanting to come to this fine establishment for about two years now, which is extremely sad given how often I'm at the opera house. I went here on my vacation to meet up with a friend for lunch on a Friday. I was a little bit amazed by when I walked in that only a couple was sat down eating, and we were in the middle of lunch hour. a decent amount of seating in this establishment, they have the walls decorated with pasta/sauce/oils on the left hand side as you walk in which is a really awesome selection when you actually do a double take on some of the items that are being sold. this open concept establishment means that as soon as you order, the food is cooked and you can see EVERYTHING, which makes for a nice change in pace, but even before I ordered I was fascinated with how small the kitchen area is, and everything that was on the menu to be offered. right off the bat when looking at the menu I was impressed by how simple the menu was, but the choices that were available, for example meatballs and pasta, BUT what kind of meatballs(beef, chicken, pork or veggie) and then what kind of pasta(numerous!) and sauces. I went with a sandwich, balls in sauce, and penne with balls(all pork) as I was finishing up my order, I was further fascinated with all the tiny details that this place to offer, the oils, the cheeses, everything. I also couldn't help but notice the different types of oil that they had to put on what you were eating, one version named heaven, and another version named hell. I was told to take it easy on the hell oil because it packed a punch, I took that into consideration. when I got my food, I put some of the hell oil on it and sat down.   *breathes in*  the food here is absolutely special, I know it might look a bit pricey from the standpoint of what you think you are getting, but let me tell you something. this food pretty much rendered me speechless, I was fascinated with all of the flavors and how balanced everything was. the marinara sauce is to DIE for, the pesto sauce is absolutely perfection, and lastly that hell oil was heaven in my food(see what I did there) dare I say this food is to die for...wait dare I say this is the my favorite spot on the east end! this place is so amazing, and I really don't understand why its not busier of a place, maybe during dinner, but still!  I really wish they had more of a dessert option when I was placing the order for my food, BUT after I ate my food dessert wouldn't have been an option. they sell cookies as a treat or dessert option.   everyone needs to come to this awesome...BALLSY place!  a decent amount of seating, transit options are the 501 queen streetcar, and parking is validated street parking.   I'm salivating at the mouth just writing this!"}
