{"text":"Had the Bison Burger tonight. Simply amazing! Great tasting burger and fries. Thank you for being a peanut free truck as well. My alergeries thank you!"}
{"text":"Disorganized and understaffed. They were out of soda and we ended up having to get a refund for our food because we waited over 30 minutes and no one in front of us had gotten there food yet either. The refund took about 10 minutes because no one in the truck knew how to do that either. It would be faster to go sit down at an actual restaurant to eat."}
{"text":"Came across the kraken cafe today and let me  say it's the best I've had in Vegas . If you see them out stop and try it out . The quality and over all flavor is great . I will be looking for them out again ."}
{"text":"They stopped off at work the other day. I figured I would give it a go. I had the thousand island burger. Hell it was good. While walking to the breakroom everyone was upset they missed out. Good fries also!  And to boot i couldn't  finish it, (believe me i can put it away).  Over all good marks. Hope they come by again"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. This truck was hired by my job for Cinco de Mayo, to have breakfast for us by 7:30. They arrived at 7:30 ! Then took an HOUR to prepare some of the worst Egg Tacos !! They didn't have a menu, no choice, just handed out some under cooked tortillas with scrambled eggs and salsa. This looked like the kind of breakfast you make in 5 minutes, and you run out the door with, not anything that took an hour to Prep.  One co-worker actually tried to eat them, and they tasted horrible. To top it all off, the cook, had the audacity to get in my bosses face because, this was not what was promised or agreed to. I would NOT recommend this truck to anyone, nor would I ever use them again. HORRIBLE FOOD AND HORRIBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"So the Kraken Cafe Food Truck came to Tivoli today. I figured  I give them a try. For $6 starting the menu is not bad. The operation  was 2 people and orders made fresh. I wanted to try the chicken and waffles and the worker said she had to much orders. I remind u they were here for 2 hours. So she ran out. I ordered a chicken strip  plate and grilled cheese plate. Okay but the hype is not all their with this truck. The fries was missing flavor. Yes it was tossed with parm cheese and some herbs but no taste. It was also not crispy. The chicken strip was okay. 3 pieces.  Really lightly  battered. No great taste.  Grilles cheese was was great on a sweet bread type of toast with nice cheese actually  melted. Also no condiments with the order."}
{"text":"When you think about a food truck you never would've thought that the food would have great quality. Kraken cafe has a surprising menu from bison too fresh salman croquet burgers the quality of the food will keep you coming back for more..."}
{"text":"The fries are heavenly, and the Kraken express is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy! Thanks for being at Hop Nuts tonight!"}
{"text":"I thank this food truck for helping me realize where the end of my patience lies....
Thee worst food truck experience ever.  The service is terrrrrrrible! Shame on you 1hr for two burgers!?  Lots of complaints from everyone. I arrived on a slow day and they were posted up out front of Tenaya Brewing Co. I waited in a very very small line of only 2 people in front of me and even then they were moving super slow. That should have been my signal that this was not going to be a good experience but I was starving so i figured \"meh, whats the worst I could wait? 30 MIns? well it was double that and they gave my food away to someone else. 
I am glad they at least owned their mistake and did offer to make me a new order but after 60 minutes of waiting and you gave a away my food? Enough was enough! 
I think at some point they should have either told people the expected wait times, or stopped taking any more orders."}
{"text":"Holy crap this food is delicious!!  My heart melted once I ate the Bison burger. The shit was BEYOND EXQUISITE!!! I wouldn't go anywhere else for a burger on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time last night out at Crafthaus Brewery. Holy fries Batman. They were so good. My husband had the wings and I had a BBQ burger. The bread for the burger was out of control tasty and the burger itself was delish. My husband liked the wings, but seriously, the fries are where it's at."}
{"text":"Kraken Cafe came to my work along with a few other food trucks today.  It took an HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES to get a grilled cheese and fries.  Totally NOT worth it."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this food truck is so ill run.  The staff is not trained to handle high volume sales, what would be a dream for most business owners is a confusing nightmare for these folks.  A burger is around $14, so you think they would have the ability to hire and train more staff.  We never actually received our food (1 grilled cheese sandwich & 1 Kraken burger), after waiting in line for more than 30 minutes to order, then another 40 minutes for the order to be cooked, I asked to cancel my order which was never even started.  Save yourself the frustration and get in line for a different food truck if you see this one."}
{"text":"Amazing. Elijah made the best drunk fried chicken and fries ever tonight at Tenaya creek!!! Try it and say Luke said hi"}
{"text":"Whoa! We went to Tenaya Creek Brewery for a beer last night and thinking we would see another friend's food truck, but got our dates mixed up. The man in the Kraken Cafe truck had a menu which left my innards crying out for every item. My husband had the Kraken burger, which I tried and that was really excellent. My bison burger with bacon and the most wonderful fresh brioche bread was a highlight of my 2.5 year life in Las Vegas. The fries are great. 
Seriously: Kraken should be indoors in a free standing, world class cafe while the brewers are outside in a truck! 
I have eaten a lot of good meals since moving here, mostly in small, off Strip world class places. The Kraken Cafe truck is an experience you should not miss.
Look me up: I will be the person with a grilled cheese sandwich dripping from my lips, a bison burger in each hand, and looking heavenward, ecstatic. 
#KrakenCafe"}
{"text":"Ate off the food truck on Friday night. I had the chicken and waffles. They were outstanding best I've had in a long time hard to believe ot came off a,food truck. I can't wait to try the actual cafe."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. They we're having issues with their waffle maker and refunded me on my meal and compensated me a meal. The thousand island burger is amazing as well as I got to try their chicken and it is to die for. Highly recommend anything on their menu! Prices are great for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Still great,  awesome menu.   Burger heaven from a food truck.   Garlic fries are amazing again.   Thanks for the unami burger."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this truck for a minute now today was the first time I tried it food was great I've tried the bison burger which is a well-cooked burger one of the best that I've tried the phrase for incredible you won't find these at in any regular restaurant you won't be disappointed the food is great quality lots of food you won't go away hungry"}
{"text":"Chicken waffles... not fast, but excellent. Orange syrup for dipping, chicken breading with a little spicy bite. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm REALLY disappointed with the experience and quality of the food delivered by Kraken Food Truck at Oktoberfest. I thought ordering a burger would have taken too long so I opted for the simple chicken strips & fries. For $6, I waited 30 minutes for 3 pieces of chicken strips and fries? Mind you, there was no one in line when I ordered food. As I didn't mind the wait, the quality of the food was a major disappointment. I could have gone to a bowling alley, paid the same price, and had better quality chicken strips."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Had the bison burger...delicious! The. Pork fries were so good, a little spicy, but so tasty!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers served with a smile!!

This food truck was one of four tonight at Truckin' Tuesday tonight in Providence LV.  I couldn't decide between the Umami and the Salmon Croquette burger so I went with my first choice, the salmon topped with greek aioli, spring mix, tomato and yes, a fried egg  The buns must be homemade and were fresh which sealed the deal.  You also get herb-tossed fries on the side, delish!!

Can't wait till next time to try the Umami burger, until then, keep it kraken"}
{"text":"I was able to try this food truck when they were at Crafthaus Brewery on a Saturday night. I love the idea of food trucks stopping at the brewery. The guys even brought our food into us when it was ready. 

They offer about six different burger options including a Bison Burger, Kraken Sandwich (pulled pork), and Unami Burger. Unfortunately, the night we tried them they were out of half of the menu items. Burgers come with French fries and are priced at $10 which seemed reasonable to me for the convenience and portion.

My husband wanted the Bison Burger, but had to go with the Thousand Island Burger when they were out of the bison. He liked his burger, but didn't rave about it. I had the Kraken Sandwich which is pulled pork with a pineapple glaze and coleslaw. The sandwich was good and I liked the flavors together. Both sandwiches were good, but probably not something I would seek out."}
{"text":"I had the southwest crispy chicken sandwich and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger. Both were SO good! My husband claims that the burger is one of the best burgers he has eaten in Las Vegas. The chicken sandwich was delicious and had great flavor. The buns were so fresh and really made the sandwich. Both meals came with Parmesan fries- delish!  overall, a great food truck!"}
{"text":"This is one I would give a negative rating to. The food truck is ran very unprofessional. I mean LOTS of attitude, rude, NOOOOO type of customer service at all. Food was below standards, and a long wait at that. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE the food truck for catering very disappointing"}
{"text":"Awesome food truck!!! 

Their garlic fries are seriously the best!! I gave them a try during an event in Inspirada! There was only one guy working the register and grill, while I will admit that waiting 10+ minutes for a burger was an inconvenience I will also add that it was so worth it!! You could taste the freshness right off the grill! the fries were full of flavor from the garlic, Parmesan and salt, they were delightfully crispy on the outside while potato like on the inside! The burger too was also seasoned and grilled perfectly with a lightly toasted bun and fresh lettuce and tomato!! Everything was delicious, I would recommend this food truck to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see the menu today at work for the Kraken Cafe food truck. Although the prices were high, I figured it must be good and since I didn't bring lunch today I thought might as well try them out. I was their first customer at our buildings location and it took about 20 minutes to get my food order. 1) their was only one person running the truck (others coming were late) 2) I ordered the Kraken special (pulled pork sandwich) the bun was cold, the meat was cold and no sauce. The driest pulled pork I have ever had. 3) the Fries were good 

Sorry guys, but 2 thumbs down. your \"special\" should be the best you have and its not"}
{"text":"I eat at this truck almost every time they go to Tenaya Creek Brewery. Food has been amazing every time and everyone on the truck is amazing. The homemade buns really make the burger."}
{"text":"I had a bunless bacon cheeseburger here that came with a side of fries from them at trivia night at Tenaya Creek Brewery. Man, it was good. The burger was cooked expertly, not dry at all. The bacon was 10/10. I was really impressed with the flavor of the food. 

They accommodated my no bun request easily - which for a lot of places is a challenge. The burger - really shockingly for a food truck - was not a la carte. It came with fries, making the value for money good. The service met all my expectations. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I tried it tonight at a food truck roundup. It wasn't very busy, but it did take some time to get my 1000 Island burger. Price wasn't bad. It took a couple of minutes for someone to come to the window to take my order. I found the burger to be very tasty (their buns were spot on and the patty was very juicy). The fries were really good, and it's been tough for me to find those kinds of fries that are not too thick, crispy on the outside, and cooked well on the inside. I'd recommend it if you're ok with a wait. From what I can see on the other reviews, it's not worth it when it's busy. Their service wasn't very good, but I really enjoyed the food"}
