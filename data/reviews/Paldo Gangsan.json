{"text":"Paldo Gangsan is really noisy. So noisy, that sometimes I've walked right back out because of the cacaphony. Still, food is decent here, banchan is plentiful, and it's open late.  My go-to dish is the pork hock plate. It comes with lettuce leaves to wrap with. With raw garlic and hot peppers, this is not what one should consider date-food. It is delicious though, and fresher than some of the counterparts you could order.  I also default to the mandu soup - nothing crazy, but it's simple, hot, and hearty. Things I definitely crave late at night and into the winter.  I think there are better places to go for Korean food, both for atmosphere and quality, but when you're just looking for a simple, filling meal, Paldo Gangsan is perfect."}
{"text":"The d√©cor is nothing to look at, and you have to pay cash. But the food. Oh the food. I went with a friend, and we both had the spicy beef chigae, and split the marinated short ribs (which I've never tried before--hard to believe, but true.) As it ended up, there was so much food on the table it was outrageous! They brought us 8 different banchan! All-in-all, the entire bill came to 32 dollars with tax and tip. The best 16 dollars I've spent all month. I will certainly be back. Four stars! The only reason I'm not giving five is because my sneaky Korean friend ordered my chigae extra spicy, which I liked, but it was so spicy I couldn't really taste the flavor of the chigae other than to know it was hot and spicy!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to \"red sign\" for YEARS! The service is great to say the least. This is a great place for cheap eats and drinks but they only serve beer and soju.. oh, and pop. The combos vary in prices depending on what you would like to eat. My favourite items to order are the seafood pancake, sweet and spicy deep fried pork, short beef ribs, and when im not starving and want to cook, the korean bbq is quite good.  If you buy a lot of combos (or at least 7 bottles of soju) they will continue to give you food that is \"on the house\". First Gimbap + Glass noodles then salmon sashimi, lastly a plate of fresh fruits. Each combo can feed 2 people and comes with the traditional Korean side dishes. I have tried half of the things on the menu and everything is very flavourful, nothing bland at all.   This isnt a fancy place for fine dining but it is definitely a fun time for a group of friends or a great place to grab a midnight snack.  They are open everyday until 2am."}
{"text":"I was debating whether or not I wanted to write a review because Paldo Gangsan is a little gem.  My husband did not want me to write a review because he wants to keep this place a secret.    It definitely is a little hole in the wall and not very noticeable, unless you are looking for it.     We ordered all our favourite Korean dishes: beef kalbi ribs, seafood pancake, soon tofu and pork bone soup.  Everything was so tasty. The kalbi was a little sweet but not too fatty. The pancake was crispy instead of greasy.  The tofu and pork bone soup had a great amount of spices without overwhelming spiciness.  It was clean and fresh.  Since I'm not Korean, I don't know what it's like to have these dishes home-cooked, but I imagine that this is what it would be like.    The prices are good and the staff are very friendly.  Definitely a new favourite!"}
{"text":"My friend (http://potterly.yelp.ca) and I just finished eating here tonight (Wednesday, around 6 pm). We decided on this place randomly but were definitely not disappointed, except for the CASH ONLY sign that made us hesitant at first. We were the first ones there for dinner, so we were served quickly with our menus and food. The interior consists mainly of wood with one half of the room lined with maybe 4 booths and the other half open tables, both seated for at least 4 people. The staff were kind considering my allergy requests, however it took a bit of trial and error communication since only the server could speak basic English. As we waited, we were served the side dishes (pickled cabbage, seaweed, kimchi, bean sprouts, potatoes, and spicy zucchini, as well as Miso soup that I have not seen before) and the classic water jug and cups. There are TVs in the restaurant that showcase CP24 and the mix of English and Korean radio music overhead.   We both ordered the Beef BiBimBap served in the hot stone bowl ($8.99 w/out tax, $20.38 incl. tax for the both of us) and were satisfied with the portion and the taste. I appreciated how they set the special spicy sauce (which is also delicious) aside so you can control how much you want in your dish (I'm not sure if they re-fill the amount you're given). Other menu options were less than $17 until you reach special combos for 2 or more people, which can reach approx. $30.   I left feeling more than satisfied and stuffed. Would highly recommend!  Note: This restaurant is accessible by climbing at least 10 stair steps since it is upstairs from street level. (Since they serve soju, just be careful on your descent when you leave)."}
{"text":"This is so far the best place I've tried in Koreatown. The decor is authentic Korean hof style, it's crammed, and it's loud. But, that's exactly what I was looking for! Finally a place where you can eat and drink to your hearts desire and the final bill is extremely reasonable. Four of us had more food than we could handle with some beer and soju and when things were said and done we paid about $60 - $15/person each! That's unreal in Toronto in this day and age.  We had to wait about 10 mins for a table and were seated in a pretty crammed area, but hey, it didn't matter. We were ready to eat. We ordered from the set menu - 1 bottle of soju plus a dish for $20 or 5 bottles of beer plus a dish for $23. We thought that special would be for just one person until we tried to order 3 of them. The waitress told us that each special was for two people. Luckily, we listened because when the kamjatang (best I've had in the city!) came, it was ENORMOUS. The special was actually enough for three people (you'd need more to drink though if you were having a big night).   The haemul pajeon was good, but a little too crispy. I like my haemul pajeon crispy, but not to the point it becomes too oily. That would be the only slight negative of our night. After that they gave us \"service\" (free food) - a huge plateload of gimbap. We were already struggling and that finished us off.   Going back again tonight!  Tip - if you want to continue the night drinking, head over to Pour Boy next door for some of the best bar prices I've seen. Decent atmosphere for a small group at a really good rate."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place! This place is the best Korean restaurant in Toronto (in my humble opinion). Here is why: - the food is tasty and cheap - the portions are big - lots of complimentary side dishes - the restaurant is open for what feels like 24 hours a day (seriously, they're open till like 2 am)  -service is fast, no matter how busy they are  My favorite dishes are: LA bbq beef, kimchi with fried pork, and pork bone soup. Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's one of my favorite Korean restaurants in Korean town. They have a lot of options with reasonable prices. I like their side dishes. They're big portion, unlimited and delicious. I enjoy having some hot pot spicy soup with some rice in winter. I like the seasoning of the food there. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I don't know why so many times my friends and I end up here when from the outside to the inside there is nothing attractive that would in any other city make me want to go here but since most people enjoy it for the cheap eats and combos I end up here once a week.  None of the food i have tried is amazing, but then again i have not tried the pork bone soup yet. We always end up drinking way too much soju here and the last time i went i accidentally ordered pork belly and kimchi which was just a gross combo and i didn't even touch. The chicken is just loaded in sauce to hide the fact it is either overcooked or tasteless, take your pick.   I give it 3 stars still because the staff are friendly and it is just a fun place to go with groups and be loud on soju."}
{"text":"I have tried ALL the K-food places in K-town. I'm not even exaggerating.  This is the BEST value, except you're not sacrificing any food/taste for getting a cheap meal.  Great taste with a lot of delicious side dishes (best selection I've seen in K-town) and cheap food/drinks.   Servers are nice, I got yelled at once for being loud, understandable (I was yelled out something), so they know how to handle drunkards without being a dick about it. I appreciate that.  The atmosphere is great - always bustling and there's usually a wait, which is too bad but hey, the place is great! The place didn't used to be so busy until this year, but I think that just shows how awesome this place it - the more people who discover it, the more people keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the worse Korean restaurant!! Staffs are not trained!!! Very rude we were not allowed to sit where we wanted instead they pick the place and we were 4 people and we ended up leaving !!!!! I would not recommend this to any of my friends. You don't even deserve 1 star"}
{"text":"Came for late night food after a night of drinking. Everything was good.portion, good flavor, and reasonable price. It seems to be another solid Korean restaurant in a sea of Korean restaurants in the region. At this point, it is hard to distinguish many of these Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"There are a few downsides to this place. It is definitely not a romantic atmosphere and you probably wouldn't want to visit here on your first date but if you come here for what it offers you will find yourself returning pretty often.  The price and quality is perfectly balanced here hence I spent so much time here during my college years. Food is cheap and good and the drink combos are cheap so what more can you ask for? Basically a group can easily get drunk and full for the price you would normally spend in other places for just drinks or food, often even cheaper.  It's kind of disappointing how the Christie k-town scene dwindled quite a bit over the years but I'll head over here from time to time for casual get together a with my old friends. We can eat, drink and have a good time without having to worry about money and I can pretend I'm extremely generous and cover the bill when in actuality I spent way more money on the chocolate I nibbled on on the way there."}
{"text":"This is honestly my favourite Korean restaurant in town (ok fine, except for soontofu). I have never tasted side dishes as delicious as they make it here, and the various stews (gamjatang, doenjangjigae, budaejigae, you name it) are HEAVENLY.  And SO CHEAP, did I mention SO CHEAP?  They only have a Korean sign outside so I didn't even know what their name was for the longest time, except \"that awesome restaurant beside the Owl\". Don't ever go into Owl - come here instead."}
{"text":"I recently came here with a few of my coworkers and this food is really good, it's low price, and the portions are big, I definitely will come here again."}
{"text":"Sadly, I'm finding that the only thing I really enjoy at Korean restaurants is pork bone soup and the side dishes. I've tried a ton of other things, but nothing sticks in my brain as much as pork bone soup.  That being said, their pork bone soup is excellent. The broth is flavourful, if a bit salty, the meat falls off the bone and tastes GREAT and the potato wasn't gigantic. I'd definitely return for it. It's also only $6.95.  The ambiance is just.. it's just loud. It seems like everyone's yelling. It's so loud, I can't hear the crazy K pop coming from the TVs.   I'm not sure if I'd be back again, because though their PBS is really great, it's also really great at Owl of Minerva, which isn't as noisy and is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Just a quick update.   After all these years, the best Pork Bone Soup Search¬ô continues!   However, my friend Reggie and I, who have gone to... we forget how many Korean places in Toronto, have found a place which without doubt sits in the top two we have tried in the city.   We have looked here and there and this place still continues to deliver. Sometimes we have ordered banchan upon banchan round and they always deliver with a smile. Well, at least for me, anyway.   However, as far as their food? Still can't complain.   The pork bone soup is literally the one thing I come here for.  The broth has a deeper, slightly more complex than usual taste, not oily and it is always hot and welcoming.   I specifically order my soup \"Real Korean Spicy\" so it always has some kick. As I find just the \"Spicy\" in many Korean restaurants caters too much to milder Canadian food profiles.   Even though this place is still a hole in the wall, it still fills a small hole in my stomach. Yeah, I am just a romantic like that.   I will be going back, hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Delicious bibimbap at an affordable price. The side dishes are all delicious as well. I may return to try the pork bone soup or kimchi stew soon."}
{"text":"Cash only. Food is priced cheap with excellent deals on shared dishes and alcohol. Side dishes are not unlimited. Service was reasonable and this place is open late. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"We returned for lunch here last week and we're impressed all over again. I had the Bibimbap and it was fantastic. The stone bowl was super hot and the rice went all crisp on the edges like it supposed to. Paired with a Korean beer - Max - which is sweet and light like a classic Canadian commercial brew, it was perfect. We were in here at 2 in the afternoon so it was pretty much just us. The K pop wafting through the place is a nice accompaniment. Oh, and we split a seafood pancake between the 4 of us to start. Just as delicious as the first time we visited. Actually more like 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Casual place with good food, definitely a nice cheap eats find! We ordered the short ribs, pork hock with lettuce, seafood pancake, and bimbimbap. If you drink you can get combos with beer or shochu.  The portion sizes are very generous, and the side dishes are great. We ended up getting a lot of food and drinks - and even more because they gave us complimentary jap chae and sashimi and kimbap - more than we could eat!   Service was really good, they put up with our group that was there until almost closing.  Someone mentioned needing water and seconds later our server appeared with water. One of our friends who ordered wine got some very generous pours.  Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Chicago proper is a dire wasteland when it comes to decent Korean food with the exception of maybe one diner and so I was on a mission when I came here for the weekend.   A friend showed me this discrete hole-in-the-wall in K-town which was packed with mostly Korean students on a late Friday night, even in the midst of a harrowing rain and thunderstorm.  The food was worth it.   The place is small but lined with spacious booths and the service, which you can take a serious hit on in Asian eateries, was surprisingly efficient and pleasant.   For $8, I had the seafood Soon dubu chiggae (soft tofu soup) which came piping hot and spicy, with generous portions of mussel and squid with the tofu perfectly cooked. It was excellent and came with the usual suspects of banchan (side dishes) of kimchee, blanched sprouts, sweet glazed potatoes, and mung bean cakes. All of it was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Best yet, we had double rounds of $3 domestic beer.   Will definitely hit it up again before heading back to Chi-town."}
{"text":"Been going here for more than 3 years. One of the best Korean restaurants there is. Food is really great and servers are nice. Their side dishes are something to look forward too!"}
{"text":"My dining companion beat me to the punch in reviewing our meal...  https://www.yelp.ca/biz/paldo-gangsan-toronto?hrid=TVKjZL5QHdRFYSxYTZTWsQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)  ...but failed to snap a pic of his pork bone soup before devouring it down to the shards and cartilage nubbins, so I'm helping out with the \"before\" picture. Pork had such a yummy flavour. And when you think you've excavated all the bones in your bowl, you're going to be shocked that there's WHAT?! one more at the bottom?? Be prepared to work for this meal, that's the beauty of it, and the reward.  Also: we knew the seafood pancake would be some overkill for lunch, but this was our first time here and we had to try it. We took 3/4 of it home. Shout-out to our super friendly server who gave us an extra container of the awesome pancake dipping sauce to bring home with us!  Can't wait to come back for a late night meal with soju!"}
{"text":"I have to downgrade my review based on my second visit last night.  We ordered bulgogi (which they call \"sweet BBQ beef\"), which is cooked in a kind of shallow pan instead of grilled on a habachi.  So you need to serve it on something, like rice.  Which they didn't give to us until we asked for it, at which point they seemed kind of surprised.  Also, second time in a row -- no kimchi!!!  I had to ask for it again.  Meaning they don't provide kimchi standard.  Which is beyond bizarre for a Korean restaurant.  Finally, even though there were twice as many of us this time, we got the same stingy helpings of just 5 varieties of panchan with no refills.  Most restaurants I've been to include, for a group of 4 or so people, at least 8 panchan, which always includes kimchi, and they always keep the dishes full.  So I get the feeling that these folks are cutting corners.  I guess I might come back here some late night for dukbokki or kimchi fried rice, but not for a full meal with guests."}
{"text":"'Pal Do Gang San' has a name I would never remember. I actually had to take a picture of it just so I could write this review.I tell people all the time about this place - but tell them it's next to the owl place and has a red sign. I felt it was time to get its actual name - in fear of people getting lost and ending up in who knows where. Hey, I have a food rep to protect....ya know.   I LOVE this place specifically because it has the best price in town for DELICIOUS Korean fall of the bone, pork bone soup + a bottle of Soju for a wopping $20. What, come again? Yes, $20 my friends. AND that fills 2 people!   Truly, amazing."}
{"text":"Doesn't look pretty but consider yourself lucky if you find this little hole in the wall. Great Korean food. Cheap. Massive portions. Add 5 beers for 7 bucks. The owners even send out complimentary noodles and Korean sushi from time to time."}
{"text":"They should change the name of this place officially to \"Red Sign.\"  I don't think I've ever really been disappointed with this place. The food really isn't to my taste and I genuinely dislike the beers that are available in the combos- but the service is consistently good. It's really not their fault that the food isn't enjoyable for me, but they still managed to get me in there over a dozen times in the past 5 years.  They also handle people that are extremely drunk really well. I saw an chubby kid who just drank way too much and passed out and threw up all over a booth- instead of throwing him out, they gave him a giant pile of napkins, moved him to a table with watermelon and snacks. From what I saw, he wasn't charged extra.  Great place."}
{"text":"Great food for great price.  If you order combos with beer or soju, they provide service AKA free dishes.  The service for lvl1 is japchae, lvl2 kimbap, lvl 3 salmon sashimi, and lvl 4 assorted fruit plate.  In the end if your not drunk, at least I guarantee you'll be full."}
{"text":"A very delicious Korean restaurant located in downtown Koreatown. My friend recommended this place for good Korean food and there were lots of great ratings coming into this restaurant. It's a very place so there isn't a whole lot of seating here. We were able to get a seat coming on a Sunday in the early evening. It got busier later on in the evening. We ordered different dishes. They also have combos that includes several dishes including alcoholic drinks. They have a limited beverage menu but have your usual domestic beers, wine and soju. The prices are very reasonable and affordable with dishes ranging from $8-$15. I ordered the Dolsotbibimbap which has assorted marinated vegetables with a choice of beef or tofu and rice in a hot stone pot. Also comes with an egg. They give out very generous portions and it was quite the delicious. It was nicely seasoned and they give a good amount of beef. We also got the traditional side dishes they give out when you're eating Korean food. We got 6 side dishes!! I always love the potatoes because they are simply delicious. Super friendly staff and a nice little restaurant. Service was awesome. We got our dishes on time and got everything that we asked for in a timely manner. They were really good about refilling the side dishes as we kept getting refills for a few of them. Overall, a very delicious restaurant to get your Korean dishes. Our group was very pleased with a very positive dining experience from start to finish. Will definitely be back! Highly recommended restaurant if you're in downtown Koreatown."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at with friends and can easily split the price with. One whole stew made us very full, so the portion are great and the service was okay"}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 3-4 times and each time I always get the short ribs and seafood pancake. This place has the crunchiest seafood pancake I've had. I don't think they pan fry it, but rather it is deep fried instead which is why both sides are equally as crunchy.   The short ribs are meaty and they're not thin and flimsy like most other Korean restaurants I've been to. They have a nice char to them and I indulge my caveman side by eating these short ribs with my hands.  I went to Paldo Gangsan with another friend yesterday for lunch and after having these 2 dishes I skipped dinner, breakfast, and lunch today. That's how filling these 2 dishes are."}
{"text":"I started coming here a few years ago and referred to it as \"the place next to owl of minerva\" until i finally saw the english translation of the restaurant signage.   the banchan offered is pretty standard, (kim chi, ggakdugi, kongnamul, gamja jorim, japchae, more) but always fresh, delicious, and with unlimited refills.   i always get the spicy bulgogi and squid on rice and am never disappointed. enough heat, enough flavour, rice is a great texture. a massive plate of this runs for about $8.  the decor/atmosphere leaves much to be desired, but who cares? there's something nice about watching k league with a boisterous young crowd."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Lots of side dishes and really good ones too! Cheap food with good flavours. Rivals my other favorite - buk chang dong that's across the street. The menu is a bit confusing though as it's hard to tell what the price covers when you're looking at the ones that include the beer"}
{"text":"An absolute gem, especially for big groups! Servers were very attentive and great with refilling our sides. Generous amounts of japchae (glass noodles) and kimbap were given to us on the house."}
{"text":"Located right beside Owl of Minera in Korean Town downtown. Came with 3 friends. I ordered the Korean think noodle with Bulgogi. Food was yummy however service needs improvement. Had to go looking for waiter to get refills on water and side dishes. Also when asked for refill on side dishes - was told he could only refill 3 of the 5 side dishes even though we were 5 people."}
{"text":"Out of all the Korean Restaurants i've been to, Paldo is probably my favourite go-to Korean Restaurant. Their Kimchi Jjigae is flavourful and their Spicy Pork Gochujang Bulgogi is what I keep coming back for. Amazing place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Korea town near Christie TTC station.  Came here with 5 friends on a Sunday around 5:30pm.  Restaurant was about 75% full.  We got seated right away at the side booths.  Usually go to this restaurant 3-4 times a year and I've always enjoyed my meal.  The decor is rundown and the service is not attentive.  They don't have many staff so if the restaurant is busy you have to waive them down as they pass by if you need something  They gave us 5 side dishes and it usually comes out just before our food is ready to be served to us.  It includes marinated potatoes, bean sprouts, spicy cucumbers, seaweed and kimchi.  I enjoyed all the side dishes but they added a new rule of only replacing 3 side dishes only one time.  This is silly because we had to share these small dishes among 5 of us.    One reason I like coming here is they have one of my favorite Korean dishes the spicy stir fried squid and beef with vegetables $10.99.  This place makes it really well with a lots of depth of flavours.  The sauce is a good mix of spicy, salty and sweet.  They give a generous amount of squid, beef and veggies.    Even though past visits have been better than this one its still one of my goto places for Korea food."}
{"text":"This place is my ultimate go-to place for korean food in the annex. Before I ever found out it was called paldo gangsan, my friends and I nicknamed it 'red place' because it had a red sign and it was beside owl. The food here is good, cheap, comes out fast, and for some reason when you order a lot - they give you complimentary japchae and sushi lol as if you didnt have enough leftovers to bring home. The regular stuff we always order depending on how big our group is: kimchi fried rice, kalbi, bulgogi, soondubu, kamjatang, seafood pancake (hit or miss sometimes - some days its perfect and some days its too much batter), rice cakes w/ fishcakes, and kimchi w/ pork belly and tofu....and of course - you can make some of the dishes into combos and get beer or soju! If you come during prime time - expect to wait for a table, sometimes turnover is slow because people are eating and drinking. Only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars is because when I was there last week, we asked for extra sides and they wanted to charge us $2/side - this is new, they didnt do it before."}
{"text":"My favourtie Boon Shik in KoreaTown Toronto. I have brought people here for Korean BBQ and it was good. I've come when I was too lazy to cook and it was great. I've had intimate socials here and itw as great- they have alcohol as well.  I'm not entirely sure what they don't do well - service isn't ever so wonderful that i want to tip heavily but it's never so poor that I want to never return again.   This is the first place I bring my friends to try out real Korean food outside of Pork Bone Soup or westernized Korean BBQ- in a group and enjoy a couple of rounds of drinks for a relatively cheap cost. The have great combo deals for groups.  The food here is so good - it is as good as the food my grandmas used to make in the country side - well seasoned, well proportioned.  They bring you a lot of different side dishes...I would put up a picture here if I knew how....  I would live here if I could. I don'tk now about the new coat of paint but I'm not going there for decor so it doesn't bother me too much.  I highly recommend the place to anyone who want to experience Korean food....the way it supposed to be."}
{"text":"Bulgogi wayyyy too salty, and no side dish refills. No side dish refills at a Korean restaurant in Korean town? Too many choices around for me to consider coming here again"}
{"text":"Yum, SO tasty! I'm half Korean and I could tell you I've literally tried the entire block of dt ktown and always come back to this location. They used to have 5 domestic beers in a combo but 4 is still good or 1 bottle of soju. Big hot pot style with friends or one serving size for cheap. Note this is cash only but there is an atm inside. Most times I'm here I get food on the house. They are awesome!"}
{"text":"Ummm opening/closing time is incorrect for Saturday and Sunday since I'm currently sitting in the restaurant...so my friend ordered Pork Bone Soup Hot Pot style for me and two other friends to share which is awesome, originally it comes with the soju or beer but we weren't in the mood for alcohol so we skipped it and got just the PBS. Comes with 7 banchans! That's a lot of banchan :) There was garlic potatoes, kimchi, seaweed, odeng. bean sprouts, salad and cucumber kimchi. The PBS itself was heaven and since it was hot pot, it stayed nice and hot, the pork itself just falls off the bone when you pierce it with your spoon. Definitely coming back for this :) The total was $25 for 4 people which is superb."}
{"text":"Visit during a Saturday night: moderately busy, loud. Definitely not a place you should take your kids to on a weekend night, because it's more of a eat + drink place than a family restaurant.   As others have noted, this place is not easy to locate. It IS located next to Owl of Minerva, and above a mini-market. Inside, there are semi-private booths for friends to drink, and a small central open area. Like most Korean restaurants, this is a place to EAT. You will likely smell of (delicious) Korean food/garlic, etc when you leave, so not a good 1st date place.  Customers were mostly Asian: Korean, Japanese, and occ. non-Asian Yelp reader.   Banchan (little Korean side dishes):  Kimchee, bean sprouts, seaweed, cubed potatoes in sweet soy sauce and sesame oil, white jelly like thingy with soy-sauce (i don't know this is actually made of, but it's good). All banchan were solid. I cleaned up.  Ok, stuff that I ordered: KamJaTang (pork bone soup): This was very, very good. It is interesting how this dish has so many variations, even on Bloor street. There is a lot of meat and the soup is thick. Mmmm... (Contrast to KaChi on Bloor, which is also well known for their KamJaTang: KaChi's has a decent amount of pork/bones, but the soup is a bit thinner, and there is a LOT of bean sprouts (a bit too much for my liking).  Spicy bulgogi:  Spicy, a bit sweet, tasty. My only problem with this was that it did not come to me piping hot, despite it being served on a thick black hot plate that should have kept the heat... Made me a bit suspicious.  Service: 2 ppl working the tables tonight, and they were hustling, if maybe a bit overwhelmed with the number of tables they had to cover. But they were nice, and they were hustling.  Of note: This is a great place to stuff your face and chill with friends over drinks. Some might be there more for the alcohol than the food, actually.  Overall, a great find! Will try their other stews and dishes soon...."}
{"text":"Decent food for a low price. I had the tofu bibimbap and it was like most bibimbap, with the side dishes and the hot stone bowl. Their side dishes are very tasty! The service is very friendly and fast. It's a quiet spot but worth a try."}
{"text":"Ahhh, this place might be 1 of my favorite Korean restaurant ever. The food's freaking delicious, extremely cheap & it opens until 2 AM. Their service's also really good. They gave us a lot of complimentary side dishes, noodle & soup since we came close to their closing time. It's so good that we came the following night lol. I'm close to drooling as I'm writing this review as it brings back so much good memory.  Their Galbi (Marinated Beef Short Ribs) are  really delicious & cheap as heck. Definitely 1 of the best galbi I've ever had. Their soup goes for around $7 - $8. I had their Galbitang (Beef Short Ribs Soup) - very tasty, good portion & cheap. The soup's very nicely seasoned & the beef's so tender that it easily fell off the bone. It was only around 7 bucks.  I'd recommend their deal = Budae Jjigae + 1 bottle of Soju for like $20-sh. Budae Jjigae contains Hot Dogs, Ham, Spam, Pork, Instant Noodle, Veggies, Kimchi & Tofu in spicy broth soup. This meal is big enough to feed 3-4 people. It's extremely delicious, great portion & really really cheap; Anywhere else, budae jjigae alone would've easily cost you like 30+ bucks excluding the Soju, which's additional 8-10 bucks. So technically, it's only 1/2 the price!  Overall - This place's somewhat hidden, small & low-key. Best bang for your buck - Not only the food's authentic & really delicious, the portions're big. Service's good and gave us a lot of complimentary stuff. If I live nearby, I would've come few times a week lol. Highly Recommended!!!         ** 4 1/2 stars **"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!!  This is our go-to place when we dont' feel like staying in ... it's a super simple authentic korean joint right in the heart of the korean-strip on Bloor.   The best bet is really the beer/soju deal. Can't remember the exact number? But it comes to something ridiculously cheap like $30-something with tax/tip and 5 beers PLUS a main dish to choose from. We've had a couple meat dishes and even though it came out super hot (we asked for not spicy), they still took it to the back and gave us a new one. Great service, it's always busy.   One con: cash only. So come prepared!!"}
{"text":"2.5-3* for me  This place is probably best suited for groups who like to drink beer as most of the menu caters to \"combos\" that includes either a Soju or 5 bottles of Molson Canadian.  Combos are for 2+ ppl and with the exception of pork bone soup or bibimbap, the combos are probably the best value.   I don't like beer, so I skipped the combos.  I ordered a dish that was described like Hwe Dup Bap, but I don't remember what it was called.  It arrived in this HUGE, 9\" X 9\" dish, and already pre-mixed, slathered with hot sauce.  So I had to eat that solo as my bf doesn't eat spicy foods.  :(    It was very difficult to eat 'cause the sauce was not only extremely vinegary, but also spicy, AND sweet all in 1.  I was only able to eat a 1/4 of it, with lotsa savoury side dishes.  I asked the waiter was the diff was between this + Hwe Dup Bap and with difficulty, as he didn't understand me, he said that there's no rice and already mixed.  The LA Kalbi flavours were much more my taste, very flavourful.  However, I found that there was lotsa gristle and a bit difficult to chew.   So unless you're in a group and most of you drink beer, I'm sure that there are better places in Koreatown!"}
{"text":"Ive been a couple years back for pork bone soup. Recently we made a quick pit stop and only got the seafood pancake. It was okay. Nothing too too special. It was a little salty for my liking."}
{"text":"Paldo Gangsan is easy to miss if you just walk along Bloor West and not aiming to go there. It is located up a flight of outdoor stairs, and it has a red store front sign.   It can be pretty un-appealing for a non-Korean person to just think \"hey I am going to try this place\" - because you can't see the inside from down the street, and the name really doesn't allure to anything. It also looks quite under-stated and \"family-run\", so it doesn't really have the looks to attract customers either.   I came with a Korean friend and was pleasantly surprised. The prices are not bad, and I really enjoy they have combos that include alcohol, which makes it quite appealing.  We ordered two combos - one with pork bone soup (not the best I have had, but decent); and one with the Bossam (pork belly with cabbage wraps). 4 bottles of beer and one bottle of shoju came with the combos, and of course, along with a decent amount of yummy Korean side dishes. That was enough for the 4 of us (all guys).  The Bossam was quite delicious and I would totally go back there again for that.  Recommended.  Tip: Cash only!"}
{"text":"Friendly-staff.  Provided with popcorn to munch on while drinking happy-hour beers.  Ordered boiled dumplings (15 for $7) which were full of meat and the right consistency.  Can't comment on any other food entrees but lots of other tables were enjoying their meals quite a bit.  Would go back and try a meal here."}
{"text":"Dinner with 8 friends on a snowy and cold Toronto night for dinner. First and probably last time.   Ordered seafood pancake, Mandu, sweet and sour pork, this squid and Bulgogi with rice. Friends ordered soon tofu, bibimbap and pork bone soup. They said it was okay but not great.   I didn't like the seafood pancake because it was very plain even with the sauce. The Mandu wasn't great either.....  The squid and Bulgogi with rice was okay. I give them that.   The side dishes was meh.   Service was friendly though :) they refilled our side dishes a lot."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Korean food! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I Found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a shot. Turns out that was a great idea!  I really enjoyed the food we ordered.( pork bone soup, ddukbokki, bibimbap) the portions were vast and the pricing was good. The service was fast and very helpful. You could tell the restaurant is family owned, which normally makes a difference when it comes to customer service. It seems a lot of people go there to drink (who wouldn't when you get a good portion of food and 4 beers for 24.99) and I would like to go back with a large group to drink."}
{"text":"Great place, friendly service, amazing food, good prices, opens late! And they have combos with Korean alcohol at good value. The restaurant is a little hard to spot. It's on the \"second floor\" between Tapas and Owl."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of different dishes and I would highly recommend the seafood pancake. It tasted amazing. This place is cash only! So bring cash! They have an atm machine"}
