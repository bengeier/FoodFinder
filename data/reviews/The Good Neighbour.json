{"text":"I like to experience a minimum of three things in an independent cafe.  a) A friendly, even if busy barista and b) a well-made cortado  and c) a great atmosphere, or at least a good laid back vibe. The Good Neighbour managed to lack all three .... maybe it was the dull, rainy weather... I don't know. The barista wasn't busy, but she certainly wasn't friendly. My \"Hello, and how are you doing?\" was greeted with minimal eye contact teamed with a semi-grimace and a forced \"hi\" . I wondered if I had a whole can of spinach deposited on my teeth, or had bird droppings covering my forehead. It was embarrassing to see such a glum barista. My cortado looked and tasted like a warm railway coffee with a bit of cream, barely foamed. It was odd. On the plus side, the decoration and layout was airy and cool, and the tables were pretty widely spaced out, so I think it won't be a problem to have coffee and do yoga at the same time. This Annex place has lots of potential, but they should not rest on the laurels of the Annette St location. Koreatown has other indie cafes just steps away."}
{"text":"My wife and I went into this cafe last week in a pleasant mood looking for a coffee before heading for a New Year's Eve dinner party. However, it didn't take long for our spirits to change . The barista must have been angry about something before we came in. Her facial expression and tone of voice said everything. We were so taken aback that I said to her that she might want to smile. Maybe not exactly what I wanted to say, but it just came out at the time. What I wanted to say to her was we don't want to feel like we're bothering you and causing friction - we just want a pleasant transaction. However, she told me that was the last thing she wanted to hear and that she wanted to end the transaction. She didn't give us our drinks and returned our money. Needless to say, we were confused and disappointed by this experience. This was our first visit to this cafe though we've been going to their other location (Annette St.) for years and have only good things to say."}
{"text":"I have noticed a real turn-around in attitude at this place. There was one barista who could be unpleasant, but she is no longer there. Good coffee, low-lit space, and I like it. The pumpkin bread and brownies are so good -- not especially sweet, and quite rich. Which is exactly how I like my deserts to be."}
{"text":"I had a vanilla latte that was a total game changer. I wish I could make this cafe my regular spot before work!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service, and most importantly - great banana bread! And the coffee is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Another cool and modern cafe. Coffee is good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The Australian barista was very friendly, easy going.  Very likable.  Mutually important; latte, flat white VERY GOOD.  Nice addition to Koreatown/Annex area.  Definitely will return, wish they were open a bit later, closed @ 7 pm."}
{"text":"Coffe is good. I love the interior design. But the seats are too close to other people."}
{"text":"My friend and I love coffee. We were both baristas  once upon a time and love trekking the city trying out new cafes. She recommended Good Neighbour after trying their Annette location last year. I decided to try their vanilla latte half sweet. Their standard drinks come with 2oz of espresso, so my drink had the perfect amount of espresso, milk and vanilla. I believe my cup for here was a 12oz. My drink was amazing. I also tried my friends drink and their espresso has a hint of sweet caramel or something...I'm a fan. I also tried their Pumpkin Loaf which was moist and delicious. 

I really enjoyed Good Neighbour. The decor (exposed brick wall) and music selection makes me want to sit there all day. They definitely beat Sam James (a few doors down) because they have a lot of seating."}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... solid spot on Bloor St where there is a lack of good coffee spot.  They do get a nod from me from using Intelligentsia beans.  

Whoa!  I wasn't expecting to see Intelligentsia beans in Toronto but here we are on the edge of Koreatown and I see several bags of their beans for sale and in use.  Good Neighbour here is a minimalist looking cafe.  It's clean and has several bar stool seating upfront and a few tables in the back.  I have to say I totally get why Toronto cafes are starting to ban the lap tops.  I think of the 8 tables here, 6 of them had just 1 person sitting on a table of 2+ with a laptop and head phones on.  Yes they're paying customers but this made for awkward searching for a spot to sit down and drink a coffee for 20 minutes or so.  We saw everyone after us pop in, look for a spot, give up, and walk out instead of sitting inside.

Service here is polite and prompt.  I would say the cafe is pretty chill... so you wouldnt be trying to fight to hear a conversation if people even tried to talk.  

Flat white - Decent cup that was bordering closer to a cappuccino but still a good drink. The milk was too much and diluted the flat white a bit too much.  The beans were good but I felt this was more milky than it should have been.   BUT I still enjoyed the drink.  It wasn't a true flat white though.  Enjoyable 3.5/5

Vanilla latte - This was a very sweet version of a vanilla latte.  There was a good balance of milk to espresso so it wasn't completely a milky hot drink.  I actually liked the beans a lot ... deep and rich dark roast that had a bit of a nutty note.  The Vanilla syrup though was primarily sugar with no vanilla flavour... not even artificial.  I'm not sure if they used their own blend or bought.  Either way, I felt the vanilla pricing wars hit Good Neighbour and made their syrup addition more of 'castor sugar syrup.  3.5/5

As much as I love the coffee scene in Chicago and was pleasantly surprised to see it offered here, I do think the Canadian coffee roasters can do well and could be offered as alternative.  Good neighbour coffee is a decent spot for coffee on Bloor... just try to avoid the laptop mob and you may find a seat."}
{"text":"Went there to work for a few hours. Positive baristas, good selection of teas, good music, not too loud inside, wifi no password and works super well, great snacks, they also have some salad and sandwiches but I didn't try them. I would totally go back!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try The Good Neighbour (their Annette St. location) but I never made the time to check it out. When I found out that they were opening up a location near Christie station I jumped at the first opportunity to check out the cafe. They definitely have serious competition as the Sam James Coffee Pocket is just a few stores down and Black Rock Coffee is across the street. 

The interior of the cafe is inviting and the walls are lined with brick. The few tables and benches provide a good place to catch up on some reading or to chat with a friend.

As for the coffee, you can't go wrong with serving Intelligentsia Coffee. I ordered a Cappuccino and a blueberry tart for breakfast. Both were delicious. I will definitely be back for more when I'm in the area."}
