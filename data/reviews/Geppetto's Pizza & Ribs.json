{"text":"First let me say that I would not eat a pizza from this location of Geppettos.  There are at least two great non-chain pizza places within a couple miles and one of them delivers.  The ribs would get an A-OK rating from me for their taste (note, we're not talking Gourmet Channel stop the presses here, just A-OK, they're nice and fatty and stuff) if they did not cost 12.99 for a half rack and two small sides.  They do allow you to substitute a different side without making a fuss over it, although mysteriously this option is not discussed on the web order site - the same site that does not even have pictures of the food when you click the menu, and requires you to enter all sorts of location data to even see a menu (without pictures) and try to figure out if you want to eat something from there.   Although I suppose the no-pictures is not such a big deal since chain restaurant food usually comes to you looking like the poor beat-up gutter cousin of the robust item pictured on the menu anyway.  The bar is the major feature of this location, as you'd expect, Lakewood's motto being \"2 Bars For Ev-ery Boy\".  The bar is large and nice-looking and the staff (both in the bar and at the takeout) are nice.  There is an outdoor patio with a scintillating view of the parking lot and the doctor building next door.  The parking situation...it does have its own parking lot in addition to street parking (Yay) but these are often all parked up (Boo) but after 8 pm you can park at the doctor building next door (Yay) but the sign telling you this is the size of a postage stamp and will be missed by anybody who doesn't hang around this neighborhood often (Boo) so whatever you do, don't try to park in front of the houses on the side street Cordova because it has weird no-parking zones that are not well-marked and when you try to leave your car there for 5 minutes to get takeout, the neighbors holler at you and threaten to have you towed (Boo) and then if you want to go around the block to get back to Geppettos there is no cut-over until you get clear up to Madison (Double Boo).   The plus of this scenic drive is getting to see Lakewoodish sights like a lady all dolled up in a party dress walking a dog at 10 pm, and a drunk couple in a protracted sidewalk embrace. Yay?  On balance I wouldn't bother with this place except somebody in my family likes the ribs. I think from here on out I'll just have them delivered."}
{"text":"If I give this place a ZERO, I would. First of all, my pizza arrived looking like the delivery driver was shaking an etch a sketch.   I don't have too many expectations when it comes to pizza, but I would at least expect it to remain intact when it arrives.   Secondly, I must have been the customer of the day because I received the prize of a lifetime. The LONGEST white curly hair was on my slice. Did I notice it before I bit in to it? I wish. I was pulling out a pubic hair the size of Gandolf's beard.   I don't understand how this chain is so highly regarded in NEO."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. First off, my first experience was several years ago when I ordered a burger and fries and pizza for delivery. I ordered a specialty burger, yet it came plain. Second, the pizza hardly had any cheese and was terrible. So I thought Oh well, maybe it was a bad night, maybe they knew they had an issue and fired those people, so I gave them a second shot and ordered ribs. What a freaking waste of time and money. Horrible, absolutely horrible ribs. Award winning? I think not. So fast forward to today 1/23/14. It is snowing pretty hard and I have a sick kid home so I decided to order him a pizza and get some wings for me. I got half cheese and half peperoni. Where the cheese is I'm not sure. The sauce tastes like garbage and does not even come close to being good. The wings were inedible. I ordered 15 hot wings, I threw away 12. The total order with tip was $27.48. Almost $30 for this crap!! Do yourself a favor, order from Romeo's or Antonio's. Avoid Gepetto's at all cost."}
{"text":"We ordered from this location twice, and will never order from them again.  First time, food came as ordered, hot and in a shorter time frame than quoted.  Today (May 4, 2015) I placed an order for a 10-slice pizza with pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, and pineapple, as well as 15 boneless bar-b-que wings.  I had to repeat my pizza order at least twice, correcting him several times (because he confused the size of the wing order with the size pizza order, did not get all four of the toppings as given to him) and I gave him my address of 4364 (four-three-six-four).  I was quoted 45 minutes for delivery.  About 50 minutes later, the driver calls and says she is at 3364 because that is what her boss wrote down.  Needless to say, the food arrived warm (not hot), and when I called to complain, I was put on the phone with the same call-taker who wanted to argue with me about the address, stating he was give 3364.  I said, \"No, I spoke with you and I know I gave you 4364, because I had to make sure you got all four toppings on my pizza.\"  He replied, \"Did you get all four toppings?\"  \"Yes, but the food is not hot.\"  \"But you got all four toppings?\"  By this time, I just said, \"I will never order from you again.\"  I do NOT recommend this location, as they do not care about their customers.  If you are going to hire someone to speak to the public, make sure they speak and understand English correctly."}
{"text":"Decent enough pizza, but the first (and last) time we ordered from there, the pizza guy went to the wrong house, even though I was standing outside with money and made eye contact with him. Then, I was eating a much desired salad that cost almost $8 and discovered the ant in it halfway through. So. Gross."}
{"text":"We regularly order pizza from here, they have good pies at low prices. Lots of cheese, good bread and unlike most pizzas these days; they aren't too salty. Keep in mind this is mainly a takeout place."}
{"text":"Should not even get 1 star. Exact same experience as another reviewer on here. I was sent the incorrect item and called to get the order corrected and got yelled at and hung up on. I took the food back to get a refund and he refused, made the item I ordered and told me I was banned from ordering again. I have never written a review, I downloaded this app just to say that anyone interested in pizza should steal clear of this place."}
{"text":"If it's between little ceasars and geppettos, I would choose geppettos hands down. Their five dollar pizza is way better than little ceasars with only an extra ten minutes of wait. If your looking for a quick cheap pizza they are the best place to go in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Ordered a take-out rib dinner, and pepperoni - sausage thin crust pizza tonight.  So delicious I had to call the restaurant and tell fhem!  Very enjoyable dinner.  They do it right."}
{"text":"This is a perfect dive bar in North Olmsted. Everything you want in a dive bar. Cheap, cold beer. Quick service. Touch Tunes. Keno. And better than average food. The staff is generally friendly. $5.00 medium pizzas for late happy hour. HUGE nachos.   The drawback is no outdoor seating and the location in a small, dank, strip mall.  Still one of the better options in N. Olmsted if you want to avoid the mall chains and bad service at Arturos's."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken wings and got food poisoning from them.  This place is the shits literally."}
{"text":"wow.... I do not understand how Geppetto's is in Business...We Ordered a Hamburger medium rare with cheese and Mushrooms..the Burger was so bad that when i gave it to my Dog..he sniffed it and LITERALLY yelped as she ran away..mind you, this dog feels cat turds are gourmet tootsie rolls... the Burger was so well done and they made sure to get ALL the juices out of it...seriously i feel it was harder to make such a tasteless burger then one with taste..it came with a side of pre cut frozen \"fries\"...you could taste the freezer burn....well, we also shared a small order of cheesy bread..well, it was ok..nothing special...there web site you can order from...plus a place to put your visa in..well, you STILL had to call as they could not process it... The Owner has a thick accent and gets frustrated when you ask him to repeat the order...The Delivery gal was very nice and on time promised .... plus, they charge a 3 dollar delivery charge the driver does not get so you still must tip...I will never order from here again..the wonderful hamburger..the awesome fries... bread sticks  (sarcasm folks..lol)  all together cost 18 bucks..way over priced...Frozen burgers from SPEEDWAY are Gourmet next to these folks..."}
{"text":"It's expensive, but you get what you pay for. By far the best \"pizza\" place around here. Got a 1 topping square pizza and 2 rib dinners and it was very good all around."}
{"text":"What happened to the days when pizza had a nice crunch to the crust??? I live close by (walking distance)... So I decided to get pizza and wings. Ill start with the good! The wings are awesome perfectly cooked and good sauces... I had the garlic Parmesan and barb q. The pizza I had to put back in the oven and cook some more, it was very doughy. Outside of that, it was good!!!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend ordering anything from this establishment. I can't say anything about the pizza, but the sandwiches are terrible. I ordered a BBQ chicken sandwich and a buffalo chicken wrap. The best adjective that can be used to describe out meals is soggy. Both were completely drenched in sauce. The BBQ chicken sandwich was described to be boneless skinless chicken breast with no mention of it being fried. Maybe that was my misunderstanding but there was no mistake that it was mystery meat- one of those chicken pattys you used to get in your grade school lunches. I also requested to have lettuce and tomato on it. I got maybe one slice of a tomato and I wouldn't even say there was lettuce on the sandwich with how little was provided. The buffalo chicken wrap, which was supposed to come with lettuce and tomato, came with neither. It was also soggy and covered in cheese.  The French fries were soggy ore Ida French fries.   Needless to say, I'd rather have ordered McDonalds. And I hate McDonald's."}
{"text":"This place not only gave me a dry, burnt pizza, but then they lied to me  and put me through hell in order to get my money back.  What a joke. I pick up a pizza, get home and tried to eat even though the crust on the top was burnt, thinking it's only the top of the crust, so no big deal; well the pizza was burnt on the bottom as well, and the cheese was all dried up. So I call the business and ask to speak to the owner, well the guy on the phone tells me SHE is busy so I'll have to wait. After sitting on hold for a few minutes I hand up and call back, thinking they were busy. I get a woman on the phone and when I ask to speak to the owner, she informs me that she is the owner; so I go into what happened with my pizza and that I would like a new pizza delivered to me or my money back, at which points she asks me to hold, which I do for another couple of minutes until yet another woman gets on the phone and tells me shes the owner and asks me if I could help her. I'm a little upset now since the last lady lied to me and tell the owner about whom simply blows it off as well that was my daughter, so how can I help you. Well I tell her I don't know if she can since the last two people I've talked to haven't been much help and one even lied to me, again, she wants to get me off the phone and tells me if I'm not happy with the pizza to come back up to the store and get my money back. Then when I show up to the store some guy acting as the manager looks at my pizza and tells me there's nothing wrong with it and that I can't have my money back. At this point I feel like getting into an argument with them but really aren't in the mood, so I ask to speak with the owner, and when she comes over to me, she looks at the pizza and tells me she'll give me my money back, but there was nothing wrong with it. So, my conclusion to this is that Geppetto's idea of a pizza is one that is dried out, and burnt both around the upper crust and the bottom of the pizza; so if you're looking for dried up burnt pizza, I would suggestion you go to Geppetto's at this location, AND if you're looking for attitude from the owner as well as everyone else who works there, this definitely is the place for you to go. AND of yea, if you want someone to lie to you about being the owner, and it's acceptable behavior on the actual owners behalf, then go here as well."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a Browns, Cavs or Indians game. Mostly local people. Great atmosphere and food by next door Geppettos makes it a great place."}
{"text":"This place is pretty OK.... surprisingly enough.   The food is nothing to write home about. They won't cook your burger anything below \"medium\" -- and what they call \"medium\" is \"WELL DONE\" to me.   But, any damn way -- this is a good place to grab a beer or 6. Or a shot and beer. Or several shots. You catch my drift.   The bartenders are nice and efficient too.   There's usually a DJ on weekend nights. He played some song about Lebron James when I was there last Friday. It was probably the best song ever and I wish I wouldn't have gotten so blitzed that night because maybe I'd remember the name of it."}
{"text":"One of the great mysteries growing up here in Cleveland in the 80's was \"How the hell did Geppetto's win all those Rib Cook-offs with such mediocre ribs?\" I mean, WMMS won the Best Radio Station Award in Rolling Stone for 9 straight years because they were the greatest radio station ever, right?  Oh.  Maybe I just don't understand how a thin, not-really-saucy, not-really-cheesy, not-really-flavorful pie can have a rabid following. It could be that the ketchup plus vinegar plus a few spices barbecue sauce is just lost on my palate that tends to look for creativity. Maybe I just don't like the abomination that are boiled ribs.  Or, maybe it's just that Geppetto's food just isn't that good. There's very little to get excited about on the menu, and just as much to get excited about inside of Johnny Malloy's, the bar portion of the company. If you're looking for the mundane, the mediocre and the malaise of food that just does rather than assert itself as something different, Geppetto's is right up your alley.  Anyone else should probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a beer on a Sunday afternoon & the bar was crowded.  Many, many, TV sets all tuned to sports events. Quite a high noise level. Can't vouch for the bar food as I didn't have any, but quite a few other people were eating at the bar and no one was gagging. A nice place if you like this sort of thing..."}
{"text":"No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No No.  I don't usually scathe a business so publicly.  BUT Geppetto's has no online  manner for a complaint to be filed. Guess they are not interested. So here goes.  I will give you my summary first:  The food is terrible, the delivery service is laughable and the bar is dangerous.  If you want delivery, try Marco's or Captain Tony';s.  If you want to  sit down, settle in to Rummy's the local joint down the street.  Same side, just to the west.  My particulars:  Placed an order at 6:37 PM.  Got a 45 minute commitment. Called at 7:45...\"the driver is around the corner\"... Called at 8:15.....\"no really he is around the corner...\"  Called at  8:28PM ...\"no really ... we mean it...\"  8:35:  a wet cold pizza and wings and a dressing less salad arrives delivered by a jerk of a driver.    *8:35 called Geppettos.  Expressed my dissatisfaction.  Spoke with manager \"Daryl\" who offered me half off my bill.  Really Daryl?  You want to dicker with me?  You can keep my 40 bucks Daryl, enjoy them, treasure them, because I will never bring another  ONE of my dollars into your joint.;  Get a clue Daryl.  If I'm taking the time to call you...it is NOT about the money.    In summary...Marco's, Captain Tony's.  Geppetto's?  No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No No."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza. They refused to sell a side of anchovies. I won't order from them again. The manager said that it was state law that would not allow them to sell anchovies unless they're cooked onto the pizza."}
{"text":"Great family owned and run business.  Always friendly!  The attached Bar - KC's is awesome...Good drink specials and friendly bartenders."}
{"text":"First off, incredibly nice service.  Pizza burgers were great. Just the right amount of sauce and cheese. Wings with garlic buffalo  sauce were also very good. Verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry garlicky. Loaded fries were meh. Needed seasoning. Italian sub was just ok. Bread was supposed to be toasted and wasn't. All food received was lukewarm.   Note: if you plan on using the BeyondMenu app, save yourself the time and just call. Because they will call you if you plan on using a debit/credit card. Also the app has menu items that this location does not have."}
{"text":"Well, I can say these are some of my favorite wings in Cleveland. They are plump fried crispy and the hot garlic sauce is the bomb. This is my Atkins treat. I used to go to their wing nite. They have a decent beer selection. The crowd is mostly older so it is not as rowdy as some of the other South Euclid dive bars. The bar keeps are pretty cool. They have a rib dinner for like 6 bucks on Sunday. I'm not a huge fan of barbecue sauce so I get my ribs with the spicy garlic wing sauce. Try it you will be surprised. My motto is to think outside the rib! The lighting is very dim, this is a good place to drink by yourself if you are into that type of thing."}
{"text":"We always get ribs from here... for the last 15 years or more.  The sauce is really good, and I'm not even a huge ribs person.  When there's an occasion, this is our spot."}
{"text":"The owner is rude on the phone. The ribs were terrible and I was charged more than the website special stated and the owner said he didn't approve that price."}
{"text":"Be careful- they create their own hours at will.  I called this location 2 hours before closing with a substantial order and they answered, and very nonchalantly told me \"We decided to stop delivery bc we've been bored.\"  Um, this is your job. Does your bank close 2 hours early when they get bored? Some might want to tell the 22 year old millennial behind the counter that your EARN your keep, it's not given to lazy people."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. I've given this establishment 3 chances. The owner is extremely rude on the telephone, he doesn't speak or understand English and becomes angered when this occurs. All 3 orders were made with him. All 3 had incorrect items. All 3 had at least 1 item that was cold and stale. When you call to let them know they forgot something or sent the wrong item, the owner yells at you and hangs up on you. One time he admitted he knew he no longer had what I ordered but rather than tell me, he charged me and sent a random item in it's place! (An item that contained an allergen that I cannot consume!) PLEASE AVOID."}
{"text":"Gotten take-away here a few times now.  Today might be it for a while.  Ken is spot on about the manager \"Darryl\".  Dude always is a spaz and talks to the employees like crap.  That dont jive with me.  I work for a living and if someone talks to me like that they deserved to get a suplex off the top rope of life.  Food quality is OK.  We always get rib dinners and at least one thing is missing from a dinner (roll, forks, sauce) each time we go.  The rediculously tan girl that always comes over to help is always very nice and cool as a cucumber.  Tanning doesn't slow her down one bit, folks!  The bar always seems to have good daily specials and seems to be jumpin.  Guess I gotta get some green gators and bust out a few bucks for Jodeci on the juke....its that kinda party..."}
{"text":"I'd avoided this Geppetto's/Johnny Malloy's combo for years because...well...I expected it to be a dive.  I'd ordered take out from the place plenty of times but I'd never actually stepped through the doors into Johnny Malloy's.  (it's like you're going into a completely different business...because you kind of are)  Johnny Malloy's has a good sized bar and plenty of seating at tables around the bar. Despite what I expected, it wasn't divey at all.  Think standard chain restaurant/bar.  I happened to drop in on Mexican night, and they were featuring cheap margaritas and discounts on Mexican pizza.  Most nights they have some sort of drink or food special, I think.  The place wasn't overly crowded, and most people who were there were watching the Cavs game.  The bartender was also the lone server, but he did a great job of keeping an eye on our drinks and food and the other patrons.  I had a salad and some breadsticks.  Not the most exciting meal, but I do think Geppetto's makes a mean bread stick.  Vegetarian options are limited unless you want pizza, but I just wasn't in the mood.    I'd definitely go back to this laid back restaurant/bar.  it seems like a good place to grab some drinks or a quick bite to eat without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location 3 times and twice I've told myself, \"I'm never coming back\".  The food itself isn't bad.  It's the customer service, or lack thereof.  I received an incorrect order once and rather than fixing my order they tried to get me to buy it again at half price???"}
{"text":"Ordered their 4 piece chicken tenders dinner. You actually only get 3, and they were very small. Side salad was lettuce. It's a pizza place, but they don't even give you cheese, a pepperoni, nothing. Other sides were served in a container used for salad dressing. Very small. Food was much better a couple years ago."}
{"text":"We used to frequent the E 185th location and loved it before it closed down many years ago. Geppetto's helped establish what I believe to be true E Side CLE-style pizza (along with Longo's and Zeppe's) with a pan style, crimped crust, zesty sauce and generous cheese and continues that tradition in CLE heights today. Satisfying pizza with the coolest logo (lil rib dude) in the game! The vibe here is almost as though they transplanted it from E 185th, so yuppies should prob hit Domino's up the street lol!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely an embarrassment. Where should I begin? I walked in starving and sat at the bar. A rude bartender eventually came over and handed me a menu after about ten minutes. (The place was half empty at dinner time) There was a girl standing up next to me who glanced at me and said to me, \"maybe if we stand, we'll get some service.\" Not a good sign. A different bartender came up and took my order. He had a much better attitude than the first bitch wearing cheap makeup and hoop earrings. I began to feel better. I placed my order, and waited. And waited. And then, oh yeah, waited some more.  Meanwhile I'm watching the staff joke and have a great time while they were ignoring grouchy customers. The bartender came over and apologized and told me he would check on my food. TEN MINUTES LATER MY QUESADILLA CAME OUT. FOR A TOTAL OF 30 MINUTES AFTER PLACING THE ORDER. It was bland, dry, and was served with bottled salsa. Listen,  I'm from NYC, and was visiting a bar in Cleveland.  I wasn't expecting great food, but what happened to the Midwestern friendliness and courtesy? This was horrendous. Don't go here"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to stop for a drink and a bite at their bar.  Their bar is called \"Johnny Malloys\" and it was rather divey and filled with local regulars.  Me, not being a regular it took a while to decide what I wanted to drink, and the server acted rather impatient or bothered.  I then ordered my drink and decided to eat the cheese fries.  When they came out they were not tasty at all.  They poured liquid cheese on some french fries.  I thought being a pizza place they would at least use real cheese.  So I inquired about this and she just said \"if that is what you wanted you should have asked\" and offered no accommodations.  Again that same attitude that she is doing be a favor.  With that being said, this place is not for me and I doubt if I will return."}
{"text":"I am boycotting Geppeto's Pizza on Dover Rd and will never patronize that store again. We ordered pizza and wings last week and they sent the wrong wings. We called and spoke with the manager in charge and told him what had happened. To make a long story short, he argued and starting yelling at us and called us a liar and that there was nothing he could do. We asked to speak with the owner who evidently was not available. We left several messages the next day and no one called him back. It sounds to me this place needs to take lessons in customer service asap."}
{"text":"I was starving. I wanted something healthy. I have had trouble with Geppettos in the past but I wanted to try a new location.  At 8:39pm on a snowy Saturday night in Cleveland, I called Geppetto's in Cleveland at the corner of Clifton and W.117th.  I ordered a small pizza for my son, a chicken quesedilla for my wife and for myself....a grilled chicken breast salad. In order to pick it up, I had to travel on snowy and icy roads.  About 20 minutes later I arrived at Geppettos to pick up my order.   After we (my family) picked up our food, we stopped at Giant Eagle on W117th to pick up some sodas. It was still snowing and ice was forming on the road.   About 9:30pm we made it home. We all could not wait to eat our food. The pizza looked great, the quesedilla looked good, but wait.....my salad was a little side salad. It had globs of carrots on it.  This was not a grilled chicken breast salad, this was a tiny side salad...or carrot salad. Gobs of shredded carrots.  I WAS PISSED. I had paid $22.47 for our order.   I got back in the car and started heading back to Geppettos, but the roads were very slick and icy. My life is not worth a puny side salad.   I went back home and ate my salad because I was so hungry. I didn't call Geppetto's because I know people will read this. This is my second time getting screwed by a business that was once great.   My first review of Geppetto's was back in June of 2008 http://dailybragger.com/restaurant-review-4.php  When I lived in Middleburg hts 10 years ago, Geppetto's was awesome. I would recommend them to everyone. Now, they went down hill.  I'll never patronize them again."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER PATRONIZE THIS BUSINESS AGAIN!  If i could give negative stars, i woukd give -10. Sent my hubby in last night to pick up a pizza and because he parked next to the building the owner threatened to call the police, his wife who works at the South Euclid Giant Eagle decided to co-sign that decision.  This man is talking all sweet to the white customers but nasty to the black folks.  His largest customer base is black! Especially in the bar (Johnny Malloy's). He is obviously a racist and he can take this to the bank, I WILL NEVER ORDER FOOD FROM THERE AGAIN! No wonder he can't keep his employees  (they are all black btw, and I am bi-racial [blk. father/wht. mother] so I've dealt with racism my entire life)"}
{"text":"The pizza really was not too enjoyable. Digiorno's may be better on some occassions. However, they have a special that they run all the time for $3.99 for a one topping medium! This is recession food! I brought a couple pizzas for my friends on Friday night and was the hero of the day."}
{"text":"We have eaten in and had delivery.  They will deliver the full menu which is nice.  The food is just regular bar food.  The wings are not good delivered.  This is a good dine in if you want basic bar food.  Their pizza is pretty good.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the service that I receive every time I order from this location and their food is fantastic"}
