{"text":"This is a fairly new breakfast place in Markham. I wanted to try their Passionfruit latte because it sounded pretty unique. I got their flat white, passionfruit latte and sunrise breakfast. The sunrise breakfast is enough to share and I was excited to try the potatoes but they weren't amazing. The flat white and passionfruit latte was average. 

The interior of this place was really nice and neat and the service was really good."}
{"text":"The first impression of this place is nice and clean. Simple decor (train wall paper with an actual train art at the front), warm welcoming and soft music set up. Their platform sandwich has a great balance and I like their home made fries. We also ordered the piggy, I like the bread they used. Coffee is their forte. The owner has chosen quite a few coffee bean options for pour-over which I should say is not common in the Markham area.

The green tea latte is flavourful. Unlike many other cafes, this matcha is not bitter and has very nice taste. 

You can tell this is a cafe owner has a passion for this business. For sure will come back again."}
{"text":"Newly opened cafe in Markham. The winter brunch menu is delicious, but I wish the food was hotter when it arrived at our table. The salad and potato curls are both amazing choices for the sides, but personally I liked the potatoes more - they taste like super super thin chips.

The drinks are good too. They also do latte art. Sometimes the picture turns it fuzzy though... and again, the drinks were not as hot as I had hoped when I drank it."}
{"text":"I'm glad that Markham is opening another cafe like Alchemy (across the street) that focuses on the quality of their coffee, clean decor and brunch food with a modern twist.  I enjoyed a cappuccino with a nutty taste and a sunrise waffle sandwich.  Lots of choices for coffee whether you want a pour over, espresso or flavour latte.  Sunrise waffle sandwich has a great combo of sweet and savory from the carmelized onion and bacon.  Fries on the side was too salty.  

The atmosphere looks clean and relaxed - I can see myself spending a few hours there reading a book or doing computer work.  I believe they are still experimenting with their menu.  I do hope they launch a coffee combo so i get to basically do coffee tasting (hence the variety of beans they have there).  The brunch menu wise - to be honest, nothing really stands out to me besides the waffle sandwich.  I was excited to try breakfast nachos today because I thought it was a brilliant idea but apparently got taken off due to portion size.  I would suggest renaming some of their items so people know it has a creative twist and curious to try, rather than just calling it say chicken salad or mushroom soup on the menu. 

Anyway, it is a cute little cafe that is on the right track and has lots of potential.  The barista and server were nice.  I would come back to try other type of coffee."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop in Markham! Quiet, soothing jazz in the background sets the mood for the perfect place to catch up with a friend or two. Not the best place for a party larger than 4 though! 

Service was friendly and efficient! Tried their passion fruit iced latte. Fruity and light! Would recommend, if you're looking to try something new! Great pick me up on a slow morning! 

Didn't get a chance to try their food, but everything that came out of the kitchen looked great! Nicely plated. 

Will come back again :)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a few weeks ago. We lucked out with the big table. Love the decor.  Staff was friendly and nice. Coffee was great but the wait for the food not so much. I would love this place if their kitchen was faster."}
{"text":"The cafe here is beautiful. It feels like I've boarded a train when I'm inside the cafe. The customer service here is impeccable. The staff are very friendly and attentive. They also seem very knowledgeable about their coffee and teas.

We ordered a drip coffee and a matcha latte. They were both fantastic! The matcha latte was not bitter at all. The coffee was bold and full of flavour. 

The food here just needs a little work. We ordered the waffle sandwich and the top waffle was so delicious, but the bottoms waffle was saugy. The chicken was nothing special. I think it needs a little more sauce. The second item we ordered was a smoked salmon sandwich with cream cheese. It was also just okay. It needed more salmon or cream cheese. There was just too much bread.
I would definitely come back for the coffee, but the food needs a little extra something.  

We also ordered the bruschetta that day and they did not have it, which was unfortunate. Their menu is quite small."}
{"text":"Another great little cafe with great espresso drinks and food (savoury and sweet waffles, salads, sandwiches, etc.). The two lattes we had were smooth and great tasting. Might have to ask it to be a little warmer next time (personal preference). Food was also surprisingly good too! I had the mushroom salad with eggplant, caramelized onions, goat cheese, quinoa and some candied walnuts. Great balance in flavours. Husband had the waffle with mushroom, bacon, onions and egg which was also delicious. Will be back again to try the other drinks and menu items! Very bright, clean train themed decor giving the place a warm open feeling. Very friendly service to boot!"}
{"text":"Love the decor and environment. I had the herb waffle which was light and fluffy, and a cortado. The owner was super friendly and explained to us the drinks, just a really enjoyable experience and would definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"It's okay... Markham could use more brunch places but would eat across the street instead."}
{"text":"Very comfortable atmosphere for brunch. Bright lighting and cozy decor makes the meal very enjoyable.

Came with a group of 6 adults and 3 babies. The seats are a bit crammed but the service was excellent. Ordered some brunch items from their soft opening menu. Most of their sandwiches is served with a savoury waffle flavoured with fresh rosemary and sunny side up eggs. The items were fresh and not greasy, goes well with the drinks.

You can call ahead to reserve seats as there is lineup on saturday afternoons.

New menu since April 2018, see pics below"}
{"text":"It's good, just not amazingggg. One of the waitresses was super friendly and helpful and the other seemed stressed (I felt bad asking for pepper). Overall it wasn't bad but it could've been better, my food could've been hotter but the waffles and eggs were cold. The other plate was warmer. Overall it tasted fine but it's just ok."}
{"text":"This new and quaint cafe opened in a small strip plaza on Highway 7 across the street from Alchemy. There were only a few patrons but the place only opened up a month ago. The space itself is pretty small and most tables only fit about 4 people. There was only one large table that could fit more than four so keep that in mind for large parties. The ladies there were very nice and informative. The owner herself came by and took time to get to know us which I really appreciate. She asked how we found out about this place, any questions about the menu, and her recommendations. 

I ordered the Pacific Sandwich which came in panini-style with cream cheese, arugula, and lox ($8). On the side, I ordered a hot passionfruit latte ($5.50). Every latte comes from two shots of espresso and whole milk. You can choose from two types of espresso, nutty or sweet. I also opted for skim milk instead. The passion fruit latte was very unique and I believe that it is worth paying for! I'll have to come back to try their rose latte. The bacon waffle sandwich looked really yummy - my friend enjoyed it! Will come back for some more!"}
{"text":"Visited this place and enjoyed both their food and drinks! The rose latte tasted really great and had a strong flavor. Overall serving sizes were pretty generous! 

We tried the sunrise waffle which was supposed to be one of the more popular dishes. This waffle was crispier and went well with the savory combo. 

For dessert, we got the Waffle Supreme with the matcha icecream and it had a really great matcha flavour. I prefer this waffle since it's softer and denser."}
{"text":"We love their positive service! We tried their drip over coffee and it was very smooth and tasty. They were very accommodating to crafting my mom's drink. Very much appreciated! Thanks girls! Great decor, pleasant ambiance. Cozy, not too crowded. A place full of smiles."}
{"text":"This place has little parking, but there is also street parking nearby their store. 

I came here specifically to try their waffle club sandwich(platform). The sandwich itself was pretty good. Portions were big. 
I noticed they don't have their home fries anymore, and now offer potato curls instead. Pretty disappointed about that since I was looking forward to the home fries. 
You have a choice of either potato curls or salad. I don't know what \"potato curls\" are, so I expected they would be curly fries. But instead, it was extremely thin cut potato. Thinner than a chip. All crunch, no potato. Hopefully they will either bring back home fries or improve their potato curls. 

But besides the potato situation, they are still fairly new and I enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The staff were super sweet and attentive. So i'd definitely still come back, but maybe a while later."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended me to pay a visit to this cafe. It's opened by a sister of friend. Stepped inside the cafe and felt welcome by the staff. This cafe is not very big but quite unique. 

Passionfruit Latte
I can taste the passionfruit in the latte. Pretty good but the art of drawing milk on top of latte is a bit fuzzy.

Matcha Latte  
It does have a rich flavour of matcha. The art of drawing milk on top of the latte is beautiful except I expect it hotter.

Nachos
It's my first time having NACHOS for breakfast. It comes with two sunny side eggs, chunks of  avocados, hams, tomatoes , black beans, onions, and potato fries. There's cheese (I think spice is added to the  cheese, it gives some spicy flavour) melted on top of the nachos like a sauce which turned the dish warm. I like the cheese flavour, just that there's not much in between the nachos once the top layer is done. It will be nice if the cheese covers all layers. Pretty interesting!!

Complimentary Dessert: Banana Bread"}
{"text":"It's a small but cozy café I found on Yelp.  I'm a cafe wanderer and always looking for a great spot for my coffee fix.  The staff at Platform was friendly and welcoming.  There's a large selection of speciality coffees and drinks, but limited choices in their lunch menu.  I ordered the mushroom soup, french toast and hot latte for lunch.  Both dishes came out fast and hot.  Mushroom soup was nice, creamy with fresh mushrooms used.  The french toast fried to perfect bite size pieces.  The service was attentive and the staff always checking up on me to see if I was doing alright.  If you want a relaxing and quiet afternoon, I highly recommend this new place!"}
{"text":"After seeing so many 5-star reviews, I finally came to try it, and sadly, it did not live up to the hype - at all.

We ordered the following:
- Flat White, $3.95
- Cappuccino, $3.95
- Platform Waffle Club Sandwich, $15
- Sunrise Waffle Club Sandiwich, $16

Our bill came to $50 with tax and tips. Is it worth it? Not - at - all.

You'd think that with these price points, that the quality of food would follow, but NOPE. It is more of a $10 dish than $15-$16.

The waffles were soggy and not crispy. As the main selling point of this dish, you'd like that the waffles would be amazing - or at least good. The combination was okay but nothing mind blowing. It was also a messy eat.

We got a side of \"potato curls\" which were also soggy and very oily, and another side of salad that was the cheapest kind of lettuce you find in the grocery stores - iceberg. ICEBERG?! This salad is just like the ones you get for free at Japanese restaurants. They really need to step up their game on food.

I was also disappointed that their early bird was only for weekdays? Why? Sigh.

The store itself is quite nicely designed with a train theme. The seatings were very small and narrow and not very comfortable and I'm only 5'3.

Food: 1 star.
Drinks: 4 stars.

My overall rating is 2 stars as I enjoyed their coffee and their service was great. The barista was very friendly and came to check on us a few times and always with a smile.

Until they offer a better food and at a better value, I would only come back to study and for coffee."}
{"text":"This place is has a really ambient atmosphere and is very tastefully decorated. The girl who works behind the counter was super sweet and helpful on recommending drinks. I picked the Rose Latte and I am really happy with the drink :)"}
{"text":"This place looked like it had potential to be a great spot. Unfortunately I left with a bitter taste in my mouth, likely from the cortado I ordered but didn't receive until my meal was finished (note to restaurateurs: do not mess with people's need of caffeine in the morning, it's never pretty!) The waffle sandwich tasted really good with the torched jowl, bacon, sautéed onions and mushrooms with cheese and spinach, but was very hard to eat with the baby sized cutlery. sandwiches are served with house salad or herbed or spiced curled potatoes. The matcha latte was on-point. The food wasn't wow enough to overlook the service so I will not be back."}
{"text":"Location/Service 
This restaurant is along Highway 7, in between Main St and Birchmount. It's in a very small plaza, so you might have a little trouble to find parking if it gets a little busy. Bright, calm interior inside. Also it has free wifi, so suitable for working. Fitting with its name, there are platform related decorations all around. 
Service was great. The owner was serving us, and she spent time explaining the menu items and very accommodating to some adjustments. She was also very friendly, so get to know her a little bit more and how she came to opening up her own cafe. 

Food
Came here for brunch, so I tried their Sunrise waffle club sandwich. It has 4 slices of waffle served with sauté mushrooms and onions, bacon and eggs. The eggs were done to the right level, runny yolk. Sauce is at the right level for mushrooms and bacon is also not too oily and dry. I was surprised how the combo matched quite well together, especially when I'm more of a pancake person. 
Also tried their flat white, which was smooth and the latte art was done nicely. 

I like how this place right now is not heavily promoting itself, focusing on quality than quantity. Since it's opened for a month or two, I'm sure they will continue to strive once they're used to the business. Looking forward to coming here on an afternoon to write up some reviews!"}
{"text":"Decent coffee and brunch place to head to on the weekend and surprisingly not as busy as one would believe, considering it's near Smash and Alchemy..

With that said I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30pm and it wasn't busy considering we were seated instantly and found a parking space easily minutes prior.

I agree with Jennifer K., in that this place has a lot of potential, I mean the staff are attentive and helpful; the food is okay, and the vicinity, clean. The employee who made my matcha latte came back to ask me how it was and if I wanted it sweeter she would add more syrup or sugar which I thought was considerate. 

All their decor made sense with the name of their business which is a big thing to me - nothing more confusing when a restaurant ties in all these different bipolar elements that don't tie in or match its core idea. Their 'platform' message details a railroad mural, an old-school bell atop your table to ask for service - didn't use it though, wall art, knick knacks on a library shelf that again tie in with the whole train/railroad system theme, etc. 

I felt the food took a substantial amount of wait time but maybe it was made from scratch? Anyway, I ordered the platform sandwich sans pickles and tomatoes with the curly fries. I found the waffle wasn't crispy enough and was a bit too soft for my liking when it comes to biting into a chicken sandwich. The fact that the waffle was soft made everything have somewhat of the same texture, except for the fries.

I believe this place is just okay, and find that there are other better brunch places in the area or not too far from here."}
{"text":"Very cute espresso bar! The inside is clean, aesthetically pleasing, nice and peaceful especially for those who like to study at cafes. The service is very friendly and made for a pleasant visit.

Food-wise, I'd have to say I wasn't particularly blown away. Their sunrise waffle sandwich, served with a side of salad, was pretty good but nowhere near the best I've had--it was also quite pricey ($16). Their espresso was much better.

Overall, a decent place for brunch with friends, though you could probably find a place that serves food that is just as good, and at a cheaper price point."}

{"text":"3.5 stars based on their regular latte only

I was craving for a good latte and started randomly searching for coffee shops on Yelp in Markham. I came across Platform, which was newly opened in October.

Atmosphere - The coffee shop is located in the same plaza as Hibiki Japanese Cuisine. Parking is scarce, so it may be difficult to find during peak meal hours. The interior of the coffee shop is simple and minimalistic with a soft palette of colors used. The cafe isn't too big, and can probably comfortably seat about 15 people.

Coffee - For my first visit, I ordered their regular latte to go ($4.5). The barista, whom I believe was the owner, offered 2 choices of coffee beans. Between the nutty and fruity flavoured beans, I always opt for the nutty one. From speaking with the owner, the beans are sourced from Hatch a specialty coffee roaster and brewer located in Markham. 

The texture of the milk was on point, and the temperature was just right to create that natural sweetness. The downside for me is that the cafe uses light to medium roast beans in their espresso based drinks. Since the ratio of milk to espresso is quite high for a latte, I feel the coffee flavour was too mild and I still prefer a darker roast. However, Platform also offers unique specialty coffee drinks, such as rose and passion fruit lattes. I think the lighter roasts may work very well with these drinks, which I will definitely return to try.

In Markham, I think it's difficult to find a coffee shop that perfects the milk and I think this cafe has great potential! I really hope they will consider offering a dark roast. This cafe also offers brunch and menu options, which mostly include salads, waffles and nachos. The price points are pretty reasonable, ranging from $12-14. I look forward to coming back to try their other menu options!"}
{"text":"Access/Parking
This place is actually quite difficult to find. Here is my tip, if you aren't familiar with the area...please try driving westward so that at least you can turn \"right\" into the plaza. Once you drive past Kennedy, start keeping an eye out for Main St Unionville and after approximately 25 seconds you should see the plaza where Platform is situated. I think those are the best suggestions anyone can give you. Platform is not smacked in the middle of the plaza, it's in a hidden corner - drive with a friend lols.

Service/Decor
I really like the overall 'feel' of this restaurant. It's well lit during the day (plenty of sunlight coming in) and the decor is simple. My inner child was screaming in delight with their cute cartoon figures that were placed at the counter (i.e., Doraemon). I'm going to warn you and say that it's a super small place, we went around 4pm and it was already packed. The restaurant can only hold around 5 tables max. The service is great, their staff are knowledgeable and can answer all the questions we have about their coffee (big plus). It's a bummer that their restaurant is so small, my only complaint.

Food
I'd like to think that they have lots of potential. Not many restaurants serve waffles in the way that they do. In Vancouver, small waffles with individualized sauces are quite trendy. Their waffles are distinct in shape and quite soft. The downfall is that the taste is super bland and basically mandates the customers to order a side sauce. We got the Passionfruit Yuzu and it was too sour for my taste buds. This might be due to my inexperience, but the sauce wasn't uniform in texture - perhaps parts of it was crusted or they microwaved it from some block? I have no idea. Anyhow, while the concept was nice, this waffle and sauce was not worth my $4.50. You could literally finish the whole thing in 2.5 bites.  I'd like to point out that our glasses of water were filled with dirt (or probably just coffee grounds), but because we had to pay at the front we weren't going to make a big scene out of it.  We didn't deduct the score just because of the water lols.

The espresso was okay. The latte was a let down, super bland, no original flavour and the artwork wasn't solid. Normally I would not criticize the drinks so much but I paid a hefty $5-6 for it. I'm sad to say that Starbucks would have done a better job. I understand that drinks are no longer cheap in this time and day, but I've had way better.

This place has potential, but I can't see myself coming back because the drinks and food were not up to my standard. In such a fierce environment where restaurants come and go, they might only attract a niche market. While their service is worth commending, the chef needs to look at some improvement strategies."}
{"text":"My review for this place is overdue so here it goes.
I love this little brunch spot in Markham. It is clean and bright with a welcoming, minimalistic decor. The menu is a bit limited at the moment but I was still able to find something that I like to eat. I ordered the Sunrise waffle club sandwich which came with sunny side up eggs, bacon, saute onions, spinach and mozzarella with potato curls on the side. Perfectly done eggs with runny yolks and fluffy waffle texture. All the toppings complement well together on the waffles even without any sauce or syrup. I enjoyed their potato curls as I tried their spicy flavour which reminded me very much of the Calbee potato chips. I also ordered the rose latte and it did not disappoint. Although I could only taste a very subtle floral flavour but the latte itself was well balanced and came with a lovely latte art. The service was excellent. The owner was friendly, attentive and accommodating. The only drawback that I could think of is the lack of space for larger groups and the seatings there were also a bit tight. However, I'll come back again to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Adorable decor themed around the railroad just outside the cafe. Great staff and great coffee! Have yet to try their breakfast but it looks amazing, I'll definitely be back! Good quiet space to do work or study, as well."}
{"text":"Went to platform espresso bar on Saturday around noon and did not have to wait too long for a table. I really enjoyed the rose latte. The food was decent and agreed with the other reviews that it's a bit bland, and for me, I would need bigger portions to be full! The back of the cafe is chillier... and the drinks cool way too quickly when I was expecting a hot drink to stay warm for awhile. But I would still happily come back, as I am sure things will improve. Great decor, relaxed ambiance and friendly service for an all around good experience. I like this cute cafe more than Alchemy near by... you are literally fighting for seating there and it's louder - different vibe - sometimes you just want a quieter place to catch up with a friend and Platform Espresso is definitely my first choice in the Markham area!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden coffee shop in Markham. Service is fabulous. They are very attentive to your requests. Most importantly coffee is delicious. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came during noon on a Sunday and was pleasantly surprised to get a table right away! Was deciding between the sunrise or platform waffle but decided to get the platform waffle because of the guac...loved the waffles cause it was soft and not dry. Curly potato fries were good except it was kinda hard to eat it cuz of its curliness"}
{"text":"Came to try out their brunch menu! We all got the sunrise waffle sandwich, which has spinach, sautéed mushrooms and onions, mozzarella, and sunny side up egg sandwiched between two waffle pieces, and comes with fried potato curls (herbed or spicy) or a house salad. The waffle sandwich was delicious! Everything complimented each other so well. We had the herbed potato curls and they were very crispy. Overall a good brunch, the cafe is super cute too, the meal was just a bit pricey in my opinion at $16."}
{"text":"It's a 3.5 for me, but I definitely see a PLATFORM for bigger and better things! (namely if you are looking for a cozy and relaxing spot to enjoy your coffee/catch up)

Came across this small cafe searching the \"Hot and New\" spots in the area - and wanted to try their drinks. Like others have said, parking is somewhat limited although I didn't have a problem when coming in around 12:45 pm. Definitely a good idea to come in small groups (4 or less) as I only saw one larger table throughout. Waited around 5 mins to be seated. 

Ordered the Platform waffle sandwich (w potato curls) with a Passionfruit latte ($5.50), while my friend got the Sunrise waffle sandwich (potato curls) with an espresso cola ($6.25). Portions were both good, out of the two, I would say I preferred the sunrise, with the egg, bacon and mushrooms mixing well with the waffle. The Platform was a more \"traditional\" sandwich with lettuce and tomato, though the guac was a nice touch. Thought the chicken could use some sauce as it was a bit dry. As for the potato curls, I would have preferred a fries option because they were crispy but quite thin. I thought the drinks were well done - you could definitely taste the passionfruit and the art was definitely photo worthy. The espresso coke was much stronger in caffeine and had a good mix with the soft drink. My friend was only the second person to order the espresso coke so hopefully it sticks around!  

Other notes: 
Service is very nice and friendly! The owner checked up on us to make sure to clarify any questions we had. 
They've got plugs at each table - was especially clutch during this visit (and wifi as well) 
Found the prices reasonable for both the food ($14 for the sandwiches) and drinks
(more random note:) 
Thought the cutlery was relatively small - eating the waffle sandwiches were a minor mission  

Interested in seeing if the food selection expands after the \"Winter\" period because I definitely am a fan of the drinks here. Come here if you want some nice brunch/coffee pics!"}
{"text":"The Platform Waffle Club Sandwich was served with a choice of herbed home fries or house salad; I chose the herbed home fries.  The Platform Waffle Club Sandwich was made with homemade crispy waffles as buns, and marinated chicken, house sauce, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, and pickles.  

The Breakfast Nachos was a large portion and also so pretty.  (The lighting in this cafe for photos is perfect!)  It had two sunny-side eggs on top of layers of tortilla chips, ham, home fries, tomato, avocado, caramelized onions, black beans, and a creamy cheese sauce.  I liked how the tortilla chips were crispy and went well with the creamy cheese sauce.  It was very filling and despite sharing it, we had enough for leftovers to bring home.

The \"Kyoto Love\" (White Chocolate Matcha Latte) was really good!  It was a gorgeous cup of latte and so smooth and rich of foamy matcha and milk.

The La Palmas drip coffee was of Huila Colombia origin and had hints of fuji apple, green grapes, and brown sugar.

I really liked the soft brioche bread.  The salted butter went so well with it!"}
{"text":"3.5 for me! 

Pros: 
- Great coffee/drinks
- Quick and friendly service
- Very clean

Cons:
- Quite pricey
- Food was average

Unique place with great coffee, but the food lacks a bit for the price. The salad was a bit bland and waffle wasn't very crispy."}

{"text":"I'm a flat white snob and they make a very good flat white. Perfect takeout temp when ordering takeout. Great flavour and even a choice of espresso type. Very pleased"}
{"text":"This coffee shop honestly blew my mind away! I was looking for somewhere quick to get a bit of work done prior to my physio appointment at Myodetox (it's 2 minutes down Hwy 7). Like someone mentioned earlier, there is limited parking, so I took their advice and parked in the residential area behind the plaza and took a bit of a walk (30-45 seconds, it's really close!)

Hint! Keep a solid eye out for the coffee shop's plaza, it's easier to turn into the plaza and scout your parking, then go to the residential area vs the other way around...I may or may not have illegally reversed down the residential street and made several 3 point turns. 

Right when I walked in, it was well lit with very cute decor and I was greeted immediately by the barista who was very sweet. She offered a variety of tables once I mentioned I was here to get a bit of work done and showed me immediately where the outlets were and asked if the desk size was sufficient enough and if the noise level was low enough to concentrate.

I was not expecting it to be a full-service cafe, but it is! The barista/server/awesome person took really good care of me, came by to fill up my water and double checked my allergies as well (I have an odd allergy of banana). She noted to me immediately of any potential cross-contamination possibilities since they make their banana bread in-house, but for me it was alright.

When the food came out it was so cute - the french toast is something I highly recommend! It actually is sliced up into cubes and the barista noted that it makes things easier for people hard at work to eat or for people to share.

I was able to just focus and get my work done in a comfortable space (she let me move tables after I determined I was overconfident in my space using abilities). I noted that there is a long stretched table which may be good for groups of friends coming to study. The number of tables themselves isn't a lot, but it doesn't seem like it's an incredibly bustling cafe, but this is not a bad sign! Every customer received a lot of positive attention from our barista/server.

I noted that the bathroom has the accessibility lock as well as emergency call buttons in case something were to occur. This is not something I've seen at a lot of cafes so it is really appreciated. The bathroom itself is also very large, so there is no uncomfortable turning involved when you're in the bathroom.

Overall it was an amazing experience and will definitely be coming back whenever my physio appointments are scheduled here!

Thank you for giving such an amazing experience. Looking forward to seeing the new menu!"}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop/brunch place. Tried their passionfruit and rose lattes; both recommend! Passionfruit is a bit on the sour side but the flavour is not overwhelming. 

Also had their platform waffle club sandwich with herbed fries on the side - exceeded my expectations! The chicken was super moist and guac and pickles were a nice touch.

Note that there are limited seating so it's not the best for groups. Would recommend calling in advance to ask how busy they are, as they can get quite packed on weekends."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place as their coffee is quite superb. So we decided to pay this place a visit on a Saturday morning. I got here shortly before 10 and it was still quiet. Once the staff brought me to the table, I started looking through the menu. I was quite impressed with the coffee menu they had. There are 2 streams of flavour for coffee, and I chose the stronger flavour as I like my coffee with that extra kick in terms of flavour. 

Not long after, my latte came. I took a sip, the flavour is strong yet it went down smooth (in contrast to other company's). Also I like the aroma this coffee gave. So this win points for me. As I didn't order any food, there's no comment/review for that segment. I will come back for the food another time. 

Overall I like the coffee and atmosphere this espresso bar gave. The decor is clean and simple. The staff are attentive and checked on us if we needed water topping up and all. I will come back again and try other flavours of coffee."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent coffee selection. I love that I can select the roast!  and good alternative to Alchemy across the street."}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe this cute coffee shop has been open for half a year now, but I never noticed it despite always driving along Highway 7. I actually just found this place on Yelp when I was searching a nearby \"Coffee & Tea\" spot. 

We came on a weekday afternoon, the barista greeted us right away upon entering. She was super friendly! She asked if we wanted a lot private spot (near the back) but we preferred a more spacious area since we had our laptops with us and were planning to chill for a while. We sat near the front. 

I was so hungry. My friend and I each ordered a food item + a drink (I mean I ordered 2 food items - not really shown well in the attached pics, but I saw their homemade cream of mushroom and ordered that along with my waffles) :P 

What we ordered altogether:
- Cream of Mushroom: there were so many real mushrooms chopped within! I loved it
- Sunrise: super filling breakfast item. The yolk was spilling so nicely when I cut it open. My favourite part of this dish would be their potato curls (tasted kinda like Hickory Sticks except a bit thinner and I got them in SPICY so even better!!). The only thing was just that they were a bit difficult to eat with a fork and a bit more oily than Hickory Sticks. 
- Western Sandwich: I didn't try this myself, but my friend liked it. The melted cheese looked so delicious when it came over. 
- Matcha Latte
- Espresso 

TIP: We talked with the barista and she mentioned that sometimes people find it difficult to find a parking spot in the plaza, which is true since Hibikki is right next door, and parking spots are limited. However, she told me that we can actually park on the small street beside the plaza (if you don't mind parallel parking on the streets)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Platform is a cutely designed little cafe located beside Hibiki on Highway 7. They're still on their soft opening and more items are slowly being added to the menu. Came here twice. Once just for coffee and another time for their food.

Drinks 
Their coffee beans are from HatchCrafted which I think is a local coffee company as their brewery is located in Markham. I've seen their drinks offered at Wholefoods too. That being said, the espresso and drip coffee were both quite light but the flavour notes tastes exactly how it is described. Unique flavours but a bit too light for my liking. Similarly their matcha latte could be stronger too, but I got it with no syrup and normally prefer a bitter matcha, which I think the milk slightly overpowered the matcha.

Food 
Sunrise waffles - yum! I really liked this. The jam paired with the caramelized onions and mushrooms blended really well together. This waffle sandwich was more on the sweet side even with the bacon and egg, which I didn't mind at all. The waffles were soft with a hint of herb taste to them. I paired it with a salad to lighten it up. Good portion size.

Breakfast nachos - cute concept but I think missed the mark slightly. Toppings were ok, although the homefries were a bit salty for my liking. The nachos with cream cheese sauce was what threw me off. Perhaps just keeping it as a hash would be better, but I do like the idea of breakfast nachos.

Overall may come back to try their baked goods as the owner just told me they just got an oven installed!! They gave us a complimentary biscotti which had great flavour. I'm not a biscotti fan because of the dryness but their flavours were promising."}
{"text":"A quaint little coffee shop off of highway 7.  If you want a place to study or grab a bite to eat, this is a place for you.  It does rival alchemy coffee, but has much less of a crowd.  

I grabbed the Sunrise off their waffle club sandwich section and it was delicious.  I opted for no bacon because of the vegetarianism, but the dish was still flavorful, yet light.  The dish also comes with a choice of potato fries or salad.  I went with the potato fries, which were arranged in a spiral form.  Also light especially being fries. 

Their coffee was pretty good as well, however I opted for 4 stars instead of 5 because they took forevvverrr getting the coffee to us.  The service was polite, but that wait for the coffee cost them a star.

The place is well lit, small and quiet. I would come again."}
{"text":"Nice cozy cafe and great choice of coffee 
Great train inspired decor and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great environment to sit and study, and I really enjoyed the lattes. However, if looking for a brunch spot or for other food, this may not be my first pick (small food menu). But the atmosphere of the cafe is perfect for quiet studying or catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Came here to try it out but nothing out of the ordinary. Servers were nice and helpful. However the price you pay for their normal food isn't quite worth it. No wow factor for me to return. The only thing I recommend would be their mushroom soup. But is it worth the $? Not so much."}
{"text":"I only had their tea, so I can't say much about the food, but I can say that there is excellent service here! Staff are always present and informs you on the menu if you are not familiar with their items. It's a very clean and modern space, though their booths are really tiny (and this is coming for a petite girl!)"}
{"text":"Rainy day breakfast led us to Platform Espresso Bar!  We visited around 9:00 am to find an exclusive breakfast experience (being the only diners) on a weekday. We were greeted warmly and had our choice of seating. 

I was immediately drawn to the bright, clean and modern decor with lots of trains (hence \"Platform\"). Now it all made sense. The bar area had these ingenious hooks attached to hang bags/purses. 

We ordered from the breakfast menu which had \"set\" breakfasts. I had the French toast with a choice of coffee or tea. There were all the listed teas in test tubes for sniffing while choosing and it was an easy choice for me since I like fruity teas. The peach apricot was divine!  Fruity. Definitely.

The French toast came in cubes and the presentation was very nice. Each cube was browned and crisp with a subtle cinnamon flavour. Though the bowl of cubes seemed small, it was quite filling (not sure if it was from being a bit oily tasting)

My hubby got the Ohayo breakfast which included a matcha latte. The latte was a bit bitter for his tastes so he opted for more syrup. The milk bread toast came with butter and a red bean paste which was quite tasty. 

Overall, this was a nice little local brekkie/brunch place!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and coffee. The food was decent but not good enough for me to return. The salad on the side is pretty sad and the curly fries are cut so thin it's quite difficult to eat.  Also tired their long black (Brazil roast) coffee and it tasted water down.  Also tried their pour over which was better.  Being across the road from another coffee shop I think Platform had a hard time competing."}
{"text":"Pretty cute place and I would've given a 4 if the interior was more themed. Keep in mind that I don't drink coffee so I got a tea instead, which was actually pretty great.

This is a tiny coffee corner beside Hibiki. Parking is not horrific, or at least, not as traumatizing as Alchemy's parking. It's a long, skinny coffee shop and the host was nice. 

I got a Milky Oolong tea. I absolutely despise adding sugar, cream, or milk in my teas because I find it dilutes the taste of the tea and the taste of any additives is lost, making the entire beverage blasé.

BUT NOT THIS ONE. 

The milk was strong but did not overpower the oolong. It was a great pairing together. The scent of the milk was strong, which I liked, and I super liked that they refilled hot water for us. 

My dude got some other tea which I forgot. It was some fruity thing, which I don't usually like, and ended up not liking. In the end, we didn't share our beverages. :)

I wish their decor was more train-themed. Their whole wall was just a laminate of a blurry train photo, but at least the shelf at the back had books and cool Japanese art (like that wave). Perhaps their booth seats could be one gate or platform each and show the evolution of train platforms? Idk, I just wish it wasn't so minimal in their theme.

I really liked the amount of natural light that flooded in, though. It brightened up the entire place despite the shop having only about like... 5 light bulbs.

Would I recommend? Maybe if you're super thirsty. I'm not a coffee person so I wasn't particularly swayed. Milky oolong was a great deal, though. Def reco that."}
{"text":"Markham brunch fans rejoice! Platform Espresso Bar is a wonderful cafe to have a great brunch, grab some great coffees, or get some work done in. I loved everything about it; namely the atmosphere and aesthetics of this place along with the great food.

With clean and warm vibes, it's a place where you can relax in while having a coffee. There's even soft jazzy music which just completes the experience!

I tried both of the waffle club sandwiches and they were both delicious. Each of the two has their own respective and distinct profiles. The platform is their take on the popular chicken and waffles, except a grilled/ovened chicken breast replaces fried chicken which most places offer. Now, you're probably skeptical of that already, but the grilled chicken was seasoned well with cajun spices and was super moist. Add the guacamole and their sauce, this was a really complete sandwich. The only thing I would improve is to add more pickles. There was only one slice and the pickles added so much depth to this sandwich; namely the extra sweetness, acidity and crunch. 

The sunrise club was more what you'd expect from a traditional breakfast; sunnyside up eggs, mushrooms, bacon, etc. The bacon was fairly meaty and there was a surprising amount of sweetness from the sauted onions and mushrooms. 

The herbed waffles are perfect here with the right amount of sweetness and consistency. They were neither too hard nor soft and made for perfect waffle sandwiches. The sides were also delicious; you had the option of potato curls here in Cajun or herbed spices. I much prefer these to any homestyle fries or potatoes. They were crispy and light, and well seasoned. The salad was also very good with a sweet and lightly acidic dressing. You can't go wrong with either. The affogato was excellent here as well. The espresso was rich and the ice cream here isn't your typical grocery store variety. There's a smoothness to it and the vanilla was also very rich."}
{"text":"Pros:Interesting food concept (waffles sandwiches).
Service is excellent tho.
Coffee is good too.
Very relaxing environment to chill and catch up with friends.

Cons: little hard to locate."}
{"text":"Food was meh. We were disappointed in the grilled chicken waffle sandwich. Felt like anyone can put the sandwich together from home and the chicken was small. $15 for the sandwich with salad OR potato. Drinks look good."}
{"text":"Found this cafe on Yelp and also heard from a friend about this cafe, so came here for a visit. I ordered a passion fruit latte and a nachos for breakfast.

Passion Fruit Latte (score 4/5)
It came shortly after I have placed my order. Awesome service. The milk art on the latte is pretty simple, not bad at all, just that I expect they can draw something more extraordinary since this is a cafe. The taste is good. I can taste the passion fruit in the latte.

Nachos (score 4/5)
It's layers of nachos with chunks of hams, tomatoes, avocados, with diced onion, fries, black beans, two sunny side eggs and melted cheese on top of the nachos. It does look like a mountain of nachos as it came. The cheese is slightly flavoured and gives a slightly spicy flavour, which brightens up the whole dish. It also warms up the whole dish since almost all ingredients are cold or in room temperature. So the cheese is like the soul of this dish. The only negative comment that I will make is the cheese is only on the top layer. After I have finished eating the top layer, I was left with a pile of dry nachos chips.

Banana Bread (score:4/5)
When I am almost done with my nachos breakfast, the waitress brought a small plate of banana bread with slices of strawberries and a blackberry. It is a complimentary dessert from the house. The sweet completes my whole set of breakfast. 

My brunch meal is now complete."}
{"text":"I love this new coffee spot in Markham!  Came here a few times already and everytime my guests were super happy with their coffee and food.  I love the decor here, the blue wall and wooden tables really make this place feel cozy. In additional, the cups they use for their coffee is so cute!! I really wish I can buy one off them because I desperately need one for my new coffee machine.

For drinks, I had their Kyoto Love (Matcha Latte with white chocolate), Flat White and Latte and all three tasted delicious with beautiful latte art.  The Kyoto Love is an interesting take on a Matcha Latte and I really did enjoy the sweetness of it, not too overdone at all but you can always ask for less sweet.

For brunch items, I tried both of their waffles sandwich, the Sunshine and Platform.  Both were delicious, so it really depends if I want a healthy option or not.  Healthier option go with the Platform Sandwich, the grilled chicken with guacamole are such a tasty combination.  But if you are feel like going on a cheat day, go with their Sunshine Sandwich, that bacon topped with a sunny side up egg is truly amazing.

I heard they got new items on their brunch menu now! Which means I will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't have a good experience at Platform. The service was really nice but everything else was a miss. The cortado was way too foamy (not silky) a watered down, even though the barista offered me a single shot version. In addition to that the wifi didn't work at all, so I had to leave. Sadly, I'll be sticking to downtown cafes for good coffee experiences"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of brunch restaurants in Markham and given that Alchemy (across the street) is ALWAYS full, my party of 4 decided to try Platform. Not a large food menu but I was looking forward to a goooood cup of coffee!

The restaurant is fairly small - as in, their booths that are supposed to fit 4 people, don't really fit 4 comfortably. It is tight.. and they had space to make them even just 3 inches wider. Their selection of coffee was great. Even drip coffee, you could choose.

Overall, the food is good if you don't get bored of eating the same thing (eggs benedict on waffle). Great quiet place for coffee."}
{"text":"The aesthetic and design of he cafe is cute with it's train theme. Very well thought out and executed.

Tried both Ethiopian and Brazilian coffee. Brazilian carries a slight chocolate and nutty flavour with a bitter finish. Ethiopian tastes more floral and less bitter, not as pungent as you would get from an Ethiopian restaurant. Neither coffees were as flavourful as I'd like."}
{"text":"The first thing that captures your attention is the name, right? Imagine walking through that door and seeing a train-inspired setup and decor welcoming you into the cafe! It's a very bright, clean and comfortable space. They have a great selection of espressos, drip coffees and unique lattes. While I haven't tried them yet, I saw a great assortment of food items too! 

The price is fair and the coffee was unique to my palette. I had a drip coffee that had hints of berry and honey flavors to it which was really interesting. The service was top notch! The manager/owner was friendly and welcoming. She was so passionate that I was excited to try everything! 

Will definitely go back to try the foods too!"}
{"text":"$4 for drip coffee and wifi that doesn't work. Would be a welcome addition to Toronto, but this is Markham. Get it together guys."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new place in Markham. Absolutely in love with the train-theme décor and custom-made mugs. It's a small space so I'd recommend groups of less than 4 (1-2 is best). The owner is very nice and friendly. 

For coffee, I tried the cappuccino & cortado, both of which are good. Choice of nutty or fruity bean. I couldn't really taste the rose in the rose latte. I should try the regular brew but can't resist the pretty latte art! 

For brunch, I had the Sunrise Waffle - fried egg (kind of rubbery), bacon, caramelized mushroom & onion, mixed greens, with side of herb or spicy potato curls or salad. The addition of rosemary & thyme in the fluffy waffle is really delicious. I asked for some syrup on the side 'cause the dish can be a bit dry. The fries are oily but very crunchy - like hickory sticks. Overall it was good but I felt that it was served cold. Love how they deviated from the usual home fries & specialize in a primarily waffle-based menu."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on a Sunday. This is a cute trendy place to enjoy a cuppa joe. The long espresso had tiny bits of ground coffee, but the flavour was smooth. The pour over was good, although I wished i tried one of the lattes. I ordered the sunrise waffle club - it was ok, nothing to write home about. The caramelized onions and bacon went well together, but the waffle had undercooked parts in the middle. IMHO it was a bit steep for $16. The pacific sandwich was more reasonably priced. I wouldn't mind coming back, but if i want better coffee, I'd go to Alchemy across the street or if I want a no frills hearty satisfying meal I'd go to Olde village bistro beside it."}
{"text":"Came here in late afternoon on a weekend, and they had run out of almost everything in the menu.  I had their waffle and coffee.   Waffle is mediocre.  Coffee is nutty and with rich aroma.  Place is spacious.  Very nice service."}
{"text":"I visited this place when it had just opened (as in, it was just a cafe with no brunch options yet) so things may be different.

This is a small cafe located near Highway 7 and Unionville Main Street in the same tiny plaza as Hibiki. When I say small... I mean really small, even smaller than Alchemy Coffee literally across the road. Parking may be a challenge, as is even getting in and out of the plaza as this part of Highway 7 is often quite busy. There is residential parking around though, if you don't mind a short walk. I still have only been here once solely because I don't want to deal with driving here.

The interior is cute and train station themed - the area where they take your orders and make the coffee is aesthetically on point, if that matters to you. They've made the best of a very small space. However, seating is very, very limited. Even on a day with full sunlight, because of the narrow space, light often doesn't reach to the back area of the cafe and I found it challenging to do work that didn't involve using a laptop. Most of the seating in the back of the cafe is also very, very narrow with booth seats with enough room for one person - if you have bags you will have a harder time and same if you're a bigger or taller guy. I'm 4'11 and asked to change seats because even I found it a bit constricting. This kind of defeats the purpose of booth seating... I feel like having regular tables and chairs would be a more efficient use of the space and would also perhaps let more light in. There are a couple that can seat four near the entrance. Surprisingly, they have an accessible washroom that is very large and roomy.  

Small thing - I found the ventilation really loud in here (this may have changed since my last visit). I also found the air very dry as my eyes were irritated.

Service was friendly. I don't know too much about coffee, but I know they use Hatch coffee beans which from what I know are lighter in flavour and there are different flavour profiles to their coffee. I was curious about the rose latte - it was on par with other cafes that do specialty coffee and at a similar price point. Light in flavor, which was good for me because again, I'm not a huge coffee drinker. However, I didn't really taste rose. One day when I finally get myself to choose Platform instead of Alchemy (which is always so busy) I'll try their matcha white chocolate latte which I've heard good things about."}
{"text":"I remembered first time I came visited. 
I was sat in pretty quiet zone. On the table they will serve with the bell for you to ask service. Even you don't ring the bell, they will check you out, make sure you got a good take care. Anyway, presently, I shouldn't talk too much. Otherwise the viewer might think I'm part of the owner... Go experience. I can guarantee you would not feel disappointed. In over all HOSPITALITY, FOOD AND THEIR SPECIALITY OF COFFEE."}
{"text":"Went to visit during their soft opening. Environment is nice and clean. As a coffee person I like their coffee, tried the flat white and the barista made good latte art, and the coffee/milk/foam ratio is pretty good. Tried their platform brunch, taste is fine for me just gave them a suggestion to have warmer waffle as they were gathering feedbacks. Overall staff are friendly food are decent and location is not bad. Only thing is it took me a while to find a parking spot. Probably visit again to try other coffee drinks."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant at first to come here for lunch because it is an espresso bar so I wasn't expecting the food to be that great, but they totally surprised me! I would give the overall food and drinks 4 stars, the extra star is for their amazing service. In fact, I went back a second time two days later.

They walked me through their menu and provided recommendations. I ordered the rose latte, which has a subtle hint of rose but not overpowering like I was eating/ drinking the flower (I have had some bad experience with rose flavoured foods) - would order again. The waffle sandwiches were really delicious! The waffles were made with herb embedded inside, which really enhanced the flavour of the whole sandwich. It comes with salad or potato curls on the side. I picked the potato curls and they were great - tried both herb and spicy flavour - the spicy one is more flavourful if you like stronger/ saltier taste. The mushroom salad was okay. On my second visit, I tried the passion fruit latte...it was an interesting combination, but I probably wouldn't order it again.

Overall, I am glad that I have a new go to for brunch in Markham! I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Love the interior decor! Perfect place for coffee and a place to catch up with a friend. Reminds me of Alchemy Coffee across the street, so I can tell here will be competition!

Service is great! Server is very friendly and welcoming 

Definitely recommend their rose ice cream which we got free samples for"}
{"text":"This is a espresso bar with a variety of food and drink options. It was a bit hard to find at first but it is tucked into small plaza. I loved the nice, clean and cute cafe vibes. We had the waffle club sandwich with the swirled potatoe crisps and the belgian waffle with rose sauce. Both items were delicious! I definitely think this is a good place to have a coffee date or brunch. I will be coming back to try their other dishes :)"}
{"text":"Very clean and nice place. Owners passionate about their products. Small food menu but special items. The coffee series is GREAT!  Definitely recommend.  Menu items change too from time to time.  You gotta look for this hidden gems as it is tickets away at the former of a rundown plaza."}
{"text":"One of the best espresso in town. Good food and like your brunch menu, latte or coffee are better than Starbucks.  Cozy area to hang out with great wifi reception according to my son.  I am surprise by the outstanding quality of the coffee beans and all your espresso based drinks are double shot with whole milk."}
{"text":"What a nice place to have in Markham. The shop is small but has a very nice set up and decor. The customer service was also excellent however, personally, they lacked a bit on the coffee taste. I'm sure for most of the population, they're thinking I'm nuts! Hear me out: I grew up in South America and I absolutely love coffee. I have a very particular taste when it comes to my java being brewed. To me, Platform's coffee was a bit on the sour note. I tasted the Brazilian bean and I was really hoping for that particular flavour and taste. Because of that, I was sorely disappointed and, I'm not saying the baristas didn't know what they were doing... they were extremely knowledgeable behind the bar and knew what they were doing. Platform is not the first coffee house to have disappointed me in the GTA, in terms of taste. I really do believe it has a lot to do with the coffee to water ratio, the type of water, and the temperature of it. 

All in all, do try this place. You may love it and think I'm crazy or, you may share the same taste pallet as me and not enjoy it as much. Those guys still deserve a 4/5 stars for their efforts and skills!"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in Markham with affogato!

Cozy intetior and warming servers. The price is reasonable. They have two choices of beans, one nuttier and another one fruitier. Waffles were made with lots of fruits. It wasn't overly sweet at all.

Super tiny lot and seems like they dont shovel much."}
{"text":"This place is clean and welcoming.  The service is awesome, food is great, lattes are amazing!
I would definitely come back... Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cozy place for a great cup of espresso or latte.  They also do pour overs as well.  

Having been here a couple of times for brunch, I found the waffles quite good.  Parking is a bit limited and location may be hard to spot though.  Nonetheless, Will come back again. :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to go to a brunch place and my friend suggested platform espresso. Definitely a very cute and small venue but the staff is super welcoming and attentive. When I came into the cafe, my friends weren't there yet but I was able to get seated for a table of 5. The waitress was attentive and asked me if I wanted to order and brought water for the table.

Must order: mushroom soup & a beverage

The beverages were done with designs at the top and my matcha green tea was on point. The mushroom soup was to die for... I would have ordered another one.

My friend told me this was a new place that opened in the fall and it's definitely worth checking out if ur in the area"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this espresso bar is quite opposite to Alchemy Coffee just across the street- it is very brightly lit with light colours that feels very welcoming and wakes you up. Seating is limited but much more intimate in that it is all set up as booth seats. 

There isn't too much choice in terms of breakfast. They had  the two waffle sandwich specials which we tried. The platform sandwich was essentially like a chicken club sandwich between waffles. Flavour wasn't bad. The sunrise sandwich had bacon, cheese, mushrooms, pickled onions and an egg.  it is almost impossible to eat this as a sandwich without the toppings falling out from all sides. However the flavours worked suprisingly well together.

The chai latte had a very nice ginger flavour and definitely warmed me up. I usually ask for my lattes less sweet- the barista said their formulation is already at less sweet and suggested I try it as is and it actually at the right level for me. Waiting for them to find the right leaves for a nice london fog!"}
{"text":"Looking to grab coffee in the area and I stumbled across this gem while looking through yelp. I said to le boyfriend - WERE GOING HERE. I am definitely so happy I did. 

Located in a tiny plaza this establishment sits in the middle of it all. Doesn't look to nice from the outside however when you walk in it transforms into a beautiful bright cafe. We were greeted right when we walked in. Once placed at a booth the very kind employee asked if we were on a lunch break (which to me means that they are conscious to accommodate people whom may be on lunch  break) 

I just wanted coffee but I went with a pour over drip coffee - Moksnisa Natural (Ethiopia) also had their in house made banana bread. There is absolutely nothing I would complain about. I think I mentioned to le boyfriend the whole time I was eating that - I LOVE BANANA BREAD. Coffee tasted delicious. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area. Thank you for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Relatively new this small nook caught my eye when it was 3 months old. good addition to the breakfast/cafe scene. The interior is light and modern with a hint of rustic. Place is small and cozy so might be good thinking to call ahead. This place would be my idea of easy lazy mood days. Quiet with just the right noise for a cup of slow brewed coffee and light fare. Now I'm not a big coffee fan. It was only until of late that I started drinking what others consider and call the Divine Drink. My hubby had his usual Americano and I had the Cappuccino. I rarely take any forms of coffee without sugar however from Platform Espresso I took it straight. It's really good. My amateur buds caught some nuttiness flavour that blended in with everything. It even compliments  my backdrop - now that's something. I think if they keep this quality and attention to detail well , they're going to be welcomed by coffee aficionados really well."}
{"text":"Glad to see brunch and cafe options are diversifying in Markham! Nice change from HK cafes (still love them) and commercialized franchises. 

Came here on a Tuesday morning with a friend. The place is very clean, bright and inviting. Note that it is not suitable for large groups, but spacious for babies! 


We ordered food and drinks (see pics). The owner happily obliged our customization requests and checked in a few times to ensure things were okay. She was so sweet and not overbearing at all. We enjoyed what we got and thought proportion to prices was quite fair. 

Currently, this place has only been opened for just over a month. I will definitely be returning and hope that their business does well!"}
{"text":"I really think the prices here need some adjusting. $4.20 for a flat white is gross overpricing for a markham cafe, $4.00 for a drip? What am I paying for?

Don't get me wrong- I work in downtown, and spend a lot of time around the craft coffee shops. But I have an issue spending that much money on coffee in Markham, especially knowing that its not prepared as meticulously as a lot of shops in dt.

The food was also below average. I think you can offer those sandwhiches that you currently have, but you should also the basics! Breakfast sausage, bacon, your own variation of pancake- don't be afraid because your local competitors offer the same things. 

Prices need some minor adjusting, and food needs to be worked on."}
{"text":"Nice menu spread, lovely staff and good background music housed in a bright, clean and charming little coffee house on Hwy 7 (near Main St. Unionville).

Upon first look at the coffee options, you can tell they take their coffee and tea seriously. There's also quite a few food options for brunch or dessert, perfect for a date or catchup with friends.

I ordered the matcha latte. Strong wholesome flavor with beautiful latte art. Just the right amount of foam.

What I appreciated is the careful attention to detail in everything: the service, decor and quality of item. 

So happy I've found a new uptown spot to do some quiet solo work or meet up with friends. Definitely coming back to try the dark chocolate latte, earl grey cream and affogato (with homemade ice cream!).

To management, keep up the high level of quality and service!

Note: May be difficult to get a parking spot in the plaza during weekends. Come early to avoid crowds."}
{"text":"Was extremely captivated by the beautiful photos and had to give this place a try!
The place was empty when my friend and I went during the afternoon. The decor is very simple and makes the place feel very homey.

The menu is quite limited with only a few dishes, but they do have a variety of lattes and espresso drinks. I ordered the platform which with the herbed curly fries and my friend ordered the sunrise with the spicy curly fries.
The waffles were warm and put together as a big sandwich. I wasn't too big of a fan of the fries and it just tasted like potato chips.

The waitresses are very friendly and attentive, often making sure we have our glasses filled with water.

I was satisfied with the food and service, but 
Everything was delicious and made up to par, but the pricing just did not seem too reasonable.
Nothing was wrong with the food, but the price of a dish just for breakfast or brunch just wasn't worth it. I hope to come back again one day and maybe try the many drink options they offer. Would much rather stay here fore coffee than for a super pricey breakfast!"}
{"text":"Passionfruit latte ($5.50)
This latte caught my attention after seeing the word passionfruit. Although I will say I was a little disappointed after finding out it was just a syrup. Surprisingly this latte wasn't too sweet, given usually passionfruit flavoured items are really sweet. The latte was good, had a hint of passionfruit flavour but not as strong as I expected. I would have preferred my latte to be served hot though.

Sunrise ($16)
Homemade crispy waffle served with bacon, caramelized onions, and mushrooms topped with a fried egg. I chose herbs flavoured potato curls as the side. I will say the fried egg was made perfectly. Flavours were there, but nothing special in my opinion. The waffles were a little soggy but the bacon was super crispy. The potato curls were slightly oily, and actually a little hard to eat given their fixed form.

Not sure what I'm missing here but I thought this place was just an ok. I will say they do have a lot more coffee options. Decor is nice and the place does have a nice atmosphere. I would probably come back for the coffee, but not for food."}
{"text":"Tried both their platform and sunrise waffle club sandwiches, personally preferred the former one, but both sandwiches have a well balanced flavor.
Their coffee is the highlight of the whole meal, great selection that can fit many.
Always nice to see the owners are passionate about what they're doing."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from New York this week & decided to check this place out since it's so close to my cousin's house. I ordered the matcha latte since that seemed to have great reviews & the supreme waffle. My family ordered the pacific sandwich, the western sandwich without ham, the Belgian waffle, hot chocolate, & the passion fruit latte. The set up of the place is really cute & it does make you feel like it's a train. I loved that they had a book shelf towards the back so if you wanted more of a quiet area you could definitely enjoy a book with your drink. The service was amazing, the server asked if we wanted our drinks more sweet or with more syrup even though we had already said that everything was perfect! They're so sweet & they paid attention to detail & made sure we had everything fresh. I'll be coming back here next time I come to Canada"}
{"text":"They open at 900a, and we were the first ones to arrive.  And good thing at that, while there is seating, it is quite minimal.  There are 4 small booths that seats 2 comfortably (4 adults would be very squished), and a larger booth that would seat 6 adults comfortably.  On the coffee front, there is quite a bit of selection.  For espresso based drinks, you get a choice of two beans.  If you want a pour over, there's a selection of 4 to 5 different kind of beans.  If you just want a regular coffee, look elsewhere, there isn't that option.  I ordered a latte made with an Ethiopian bean, the hubby ordered a pour over (which they suggest you drink black), also with an Ethiopian bean.  Coffees were good, but as much as I love drinking coffee, I'm not good with distinguishing the flavours in coffee, so I didn't detect the hints of fruitiness in my latte.  Overall I thought my latte could have been a bit stronger.  Latte art was cute, something that is rare up in Markham.  The pour over I initially though was weak, but a few seconds later, the flavour was quite nice.
Foodwise, we ordered the Sunrise waffle sandwich, one with scrambled eggs instead of sunny side up, a Platform waffle sandwich, and a brioche.  The Sunrise waffle sandwich has eggs, mushrooms, spinach, bacon, and cheese on top of a savoury waffle with choice of crispy potato curls or salad.  The Platform waffle sandwich has chicken, tomato, lettuce, and guacamole also on top of a savoury waffle.  The waffle was pretty good, not really sure what herbs were in it, but I did see herbs.  Crispy potato curls were crispy, but almost couldn't really tell that they were potatoes.  They almost seemed like they were crispy thin onion rings.  I, myself ordered the brioche (forgot to take a picture), because I saw on another blog that it was essentially a mini loaf of bread that came with butter and jam.  I guess I didn't read the description properly, because I got a savoury dinner roll topped with sesame seeds and rosemary.  I was quite disappointed.
With the lack of coffee options up here, I would definitely come back for more.  Service was also great here.  Barista was very friendly and very helpful in explaining anything that we were not sure of.  And prior to us ordering, she let us know that recently there has been a warning about potential issues with romaine lettuce, not yet a recall, but to be on the safe side, they were replacing all romaine with iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe that I never noticed until recently - and interestingly pretty close to Alchemy Coffee which I would consider a major competitor. The decor and seating is train themed which I thought was cute. The mushroom salad and the signature waffle chicken burger were both tasty. I enjoyed the homemade waffle that had different herbs in it and was more savoury than others I have had. The hojicha latte and rose latte were ok. The service was quick and staff were friendly. Overall a solid brunch spot but I feel there is room for improvement in the food and drinks."}

Platform Espresso Bar has a lot of potential. All the hardware is here: a nice pleasant vibe. A Slayer Machine which is probably the only one in the neighbourhood. A passionate owner/barista who really wants to provide her customers that ultimate coffee experience.

The weakest link here is probably the food. I was here twice and really enjoyed my Flat White and Cappuccino. Lovely espresso and awesome latte art. I know I will be back for coffee. The food though was quite disappointing. 

Platform Signature Waffle Sandwich ($15) 
- Waffles was not crispy outside, the chicken was meh
- We opted for potato curls which is probably a better option than iceberg lettuce side salad

Belgium Waffle ($3) order with no adds 
- hoping for a dust of powder sugar: waiter said they only have brown sugar for coffee and did offer me some

A revamped of the menu might be in order to make the overall a better experience as a cafe."}
{"text":"3 stars. +1star the owner is super nice and friendly. Got the home made banana bread with cappuccino.  Free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Came across this coffee shop when heading to dinner at Hibiki and decided to check it out. 

They have great drinks (ordered the matcha latte; great matcha flavour and not overly sweet with super cute latte art), delicious food (got the sunrise waffle sandwich, perfect amount to fill you up), and even better service! The barista was incredibly attentive, gave me recommendations for taking photos in the store, and even let me try one of their sugar cookies.

Definitely will return here and probably stick around for a study session as this place is super cozy. If you are having trouble parking, you can do street parking vs parking lot and it's within a 1 min walk."}
{"text":"Quality brunch place. Latte was on point and drip coffee had excellent flavour.

You can't go wrong with choosing any of the items for lunch.
Shared a salmon sandwich and a sunrise egg waffle.

The sunrise waffle is a sunny side up egg in a fresh waffle. Little hard to eat without making a mess haha. Waffle wasn't sugary so I like that.

The salmon sandwich is tasty. Only minor thing is that the bread in the sandwich was nice and big that you kinda loose the taste of the salmon in the sandwich a little. It a nice healthy and light sandwich and I didnt wanted to share. I want more. Haha.

Place is kinda tucked away in a small plaza. Which is to me exclusive if you want a nice quiet small place. It has a nice train theme.

Great place to grab a coffee or a date."}
{"text":"Another great place for brunch and coffee.  Their waffles sandwiches are delish.  I like how the herb waffle is super light and you don't feel heavy after eating it.

The matcha latte is also good.  It's not too sweet which is what I love.  The people here are super nice too!  A must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I heard that there was a new coffee shop on Highway 7 and was a little curious and so I dropped by to check it out. I was intrigued by their rose latte ($5.50) and decided to give it a go. The beans are sourced from Hatch, a specialty coffee roaster based in Markham and I was told that I had a choice of two beans (nutty or fruity) for the rose latte. I went with the barista's recommended nutty version. The froth and the creaminess of the milk was perfect but I found the coffee flavour itself to be quite mild and I didn't get any hint of the rose flavour at all which was quite disappointing as there is a dollar premium for the rose vs their regular latte.

The atmosphere here is quiet and the girls who work behind the counter are really nice. It would be a great place to catch up with a friend but wouldn't be my first choice if I was craving a premium latte."}
{"text":"Alright I think I have to confess that I am officially not into these coffee cafe type things, so I might have a little bias review. First, I looove their aesthetics here. Light wood with white and blue makes the place very bright and positive. My FAVOURITE part of the place is the bathroom floor. It's so unique and really makes me want it if I ever have the chance to get custom flooring. Very clean. Quite a small cafe, so it can get busy quick. Lots of 2 person tables so it's best not to come in a group. We sat in the wood section near the back and found the seats quite narrow and almost falling off the chair, but it's definitely not a dealbreaker. 

We both ordered the sunrise as the food menu is limited and it seemed to be their signature dish. It consists of a waffle sandwich with egg, bacon, spinach, onions, and mushrooms as well as a choice of side salad or potato curls. We both opted for the potato curls. For $15, I believe it was a teensy bit high. The waffles were a bit too sweet, but the combination in the sandwich and ingredients were nice with the mushrooms being very juicy. If I felt a bit healthier, I think I might have went with the chicken one instead. The potato curls were very interesting. I've never had it done this way before. In my opinion it was a tad too crispy and a bit too salty. Even with all these critiques, it's still a solid dish and an experience that I haven't had before. 

We ordered a matcha latte and a flat white as well to go with our dishes. The \"normal\" lattes were $5 or less, while the specialty ones were $5-$7. I am really not a coffee connoisseur as I don't really care or notice the difference between coffees. The worker and I struggled with this conversation of recommendations as I didn't care for foam and just wanted... coffee... with a nice design on it... lol. I am usually happy with a $1 ice coffee from McDonalds so I am the wrong person to ask about this stuff. My flat white was good? It tasted like coffee? My friend's matcha latte was good as well. The waitress said they import their matcha from Kyoto I believe, which is cool. The cups were very cute and matched the aesthetic of the place. It was also a good amount of liquid as well and blended with the \"brunch\" experience. 

To conclude this very long review, there is some room for improvement, but I definitely welcome Platform to Markham as it's a nice addition to cute aesthetic cafes like Alchemy Coffee. I'd come back in the future to taste their other seasonal menus as it looks like they change based on the season! 3.75+/5."}
{"text":"A great find, or better yet, have the GTA's top Yelper introduce you to a cool little espresso bar.

Decorated in light colour wood with booths along one side of the shop, and the kitchen and espresso bar on the other.  This CHIC place is truly a gem in Markham.  If it had some comfy seats, it could be Markam's \"Central Perk.\"

I was shown the $24K Slayer.  That would be their espresso machine.  I know these things are expensive but wow!  $24K to get every last essential flavours and creama out of a bean, so that overly caffeinated peeps can go on with their day.  I would hate to have it go haywire as I don't think people have spares lying around.

The menu is pretty short.  Have some form of beans and if you are hungry has a light snack or have a waffle!  I had a lactose-free Ethiopian bean latte.  Oh...wow...what flavours.  How I love the sweet, milky, and burnt caramel-like taste!  Can't get that from a Nespresso!

The latte-art is nice to see - however, everyone is doing it.  It's cute...to see hearts but maybe for me, you can do something more...manly.  Maybe a hammer, a power drill, a football helmet...heck...I'll settle for a golf ball!

Espresso to me is Expresso - you're in and you're out!  Had to go next door to Hibiki for lunch.  This is such a great aperitif to Sushi - sort of!  :D

Oh...by the way, parking is a nightmare.  If you find yourself without one...park on the street and it's a 30 second walk to the shop.

I'm going to have to wait for the home version of the slayer.  Until then, it's a Saeco world for me.

Cheers!!!"}
