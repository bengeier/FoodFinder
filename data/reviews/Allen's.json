{"text":"We went here for dinner.  The good: Bruschetta - super yummy Great beer selection  The awesome: The patio is by far one of the best in Toronto.  The bad: My burger wasn't cooked as ordered and they charge extra for lettuce, tomatoes, pickles. Sweet potato fries were soggy and disgusting Service was slow and our waitress never asked how things were.  I won't rush back."}
{"text":"Service was good. I ordered the pizza for $16 and I'll be honest with you, it isn't even worth $10. It was small, super salty and it tasted like frozen box pizza. Do not recommend the pizza. Very disappointing. I heard the lamb was really good though."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST burger I have ever experienced! I hadn't been to Allen's in years and even then it was either for brunch or to hold up the bar. While I waited for my friend to arrive, I checked out the menu which held a number of tasty looking options but the clear winner was the page full of burger options with a title description about the full cow they have delivered weekly, butchered in house and made into 100% beef burgers! This allows the guest to have their burger as rare as you like (mine, dripping like the cow was just dropped off minutes before) and they offer a variety of toppings. It had to be somewhere between 9-10 oz. of meat and packed with organic flavour! My aged cheddar and bacon burger was about $14 without a side and I easily would have paid $20 for that experience. Between bites, my friend and I would repeatedly stop mid-sentence to exclaim how tasty our meals were! A decent selection of craft beers and good wine list. Service was attentive but not overly warm or passionate. I will be back again soon with a crew of friends to share the burger love!"}
{"text":"It's an over priced pub with small portions...Had the fish n chips and it was all batter! Never going back."}
{"text":"The previous negative, semi-literate reviews of this place are absurd. Nice, personable staff, convivial atmosphere, and not even a trace of hipsterism to be found! The prices are slightly higher than your typical dirty Toronto chain pub; that's because the food is of a vastly, vastly higher caliber. The founder was a serious barman who learned the trade in Manhattan. Sadly, most Torontonians don't really understand what makes a bar good."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and decent food. Nice outdoor patio in the back as long as it's not wasp season. The menu is a tad pricey for what you actually get, and for some reason they are unreasonably chintzy about certain things - like only giving you a tiny tablespoon sized side of syrup for their (admittedly good) pancakes and then saying refills are $1.50 if you ask for more. The atmosphere is also hit and miss. Some of our servers have been friendly and funny, while others are dripping with attitude. We used to go semi-regularly since we live in the neighborhood but after putting up with a particularly stroppy waitress for brunch one day we've decided to take a break."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I've been to Allen's on several occasions and I've had some tasty food coupled with good service. But this time was not the same. I went there with a friend last night to enjoy their lovely patio for a cold drink on a hot night. It was very busy when we arrived around 9:45 and I asked the hostess (older woman) if there was room on the patio, she replied that there was and walked us out to a table that was sandwiched between two other full tables. As she was placing the menus down we were sure to ask \"We're just here for a drink, is that ok?\" We wanted to sure it was ok to just have a drink on the patio without ordering food. Her response was \"Well you're here now\" which we both took as a snarky response with the tone she used. None the less we decided to stay. My friend excused herself to go to the ladies room and I read the menu. When my friend came back she said, let's move over there where there is little more space. The waiter came by just as were moving and politely moved the menus over along with us. We had not yet ordered. We sat down and reviewed the menu and the hostess sat two gentlemen next to us at a table for four (no one else joined them). When she was done she came around to our table leaned in and said \"next time, before you move ask for permission.\" My friend just nodded and said thank you. The hostess then repeated herself and my friend nodded again and said \"thank you.\" I give my friend credit for keeping her cool; I wanted to walk out for being spoken to so rudely, not once but twice! Keep in mind that I'm aware that customers are sometimes seated based on staff or areas that are closed, but as far as I could see none of this applied. We also moved to table for 2 making sure not to take up a spot for a larger party..... AND we had not ordered anything yet. BTW - the waiter that eventually served us was very prompt and courteous.  A hostess should be your first impression when you arrive at any restaurant or business and should not speak rudely to customers in a tone that implies you are a small child who has acted out of line. Allen's has been around for a long time and has a good reputation but if they want to maintain that standing, perhaps they need to rethink placing this person on their front line. If she is one of the owners or part of the family that owns this establishment then she needs to work in area that doesn't require her to interact with the customers. Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, amazing burgers! Nice British-style atmosphere and a large patio for the summer times. I love their steak month and the frites are decent. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We used to love it but it's gone downhill more recently. Wait staff aren't friendly, it's not personable and the food is good but not great. Hope it comes back up because the patio is awesome, as is the guiness chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at their beautiful back patio today, which is a really great environment to relax on a summer afternoon.  The goat cheese dip only came with 3 toast points, and considering there were 4 of us, the extra effort to toast one more piece of baguette would have been appreciated.  The calamari was your standard pub fare; under-seasoned with a side of Mongolian fire sauce that lacked heat.  Steamed mussels were good, but bread for dipping had to be prompted and it was tasty.  Two of us ordered chicken pizza and the results were completely different, both in appearance and flavour. Odd.  The portabella mushroom quesadilla was lacklustre with wimpy, dressing-less salad leaves underneath.  Our waiter was inattentive and seemed bothered to have to clear the table, which we had to ask him to do. He took a \"lunch break\" during the middle of attending to us and loudly blamed the waiter a table over that \"someone was supposed to cover for me\". When presenting the long-awaited bill, he scolded us for \"not telling him\" to split the bill when we asked. There were 4 of us. Not difficult.  Overall the staff and food didn't live up to the decor. Such a shame."}
{"text":"If there's one thing Allen's is known for, it's definitely their burger, which some argue is the best in Toronto. So, let's talk about the famous burger. You can get a basic burger for $11.95 but I opted for the Aged Ontario Cheddar Burger ($13.50) and added grilled onions for an extra $1.25.  A good half page of a menu talks about the quality of their burger meat and burger making process. They were setting themselves up pretty high so I was hoping the burger would live up to the hype. My patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare, just like how I requested. The meat was juicy and flavourful - a simple burger done wonderfully. My only complaint was that the bun was too big for the patty. The bun was just hanging over the meat and there were just a few too many bites which didn't contain any meat. You know what I'm talking about!  The other thing I tried was the Cider-Brined Bosdale Farm Pork Rib Chop - with mustard pan sauce, sage polenta, braised red cabbage with apples ($24). The pork was solid but the polenta was really bland. Not a bad dish but I'd recommend just sticking to the burger.  Overall, I felt the burger lived up to all the hype but I wouldn't call it the best burger in Toronto. And while I enjoyed the burger, I didn't love the service or atmosphere so if I have a restaurant burger craving, you'd probably find me elsewhere."}
{"text":"I would have loved to have eaten there but according to the staff we only had a two hour window to have drinks and eat.  We arrived at 3:00 and were told that we had to leave by 5:00 as they then shift to their dinner seating.  I have eaten at alot of restaurants in Toronto and have never been told this before.  As it was a Saturday night and a night of an event at the Danforth Music Hall we thought maybe this was the reason for the time limit.  As we had talked to the waitress and manager we were told that this is a regular practice by this restaurant and most restaurants in Toronto do this.  I have never experienced this before in any of the restaurants I have eaten at in Toronto.  We then ordered a drink each and then left at 4:00 as there wasn't enough time to get another drink and enjoy a meal.  Too bad for them they just lost our business.  I didn't think restaurants on the Danforth were this pretentious but I guess I was wrong.  When then walked along the Danforth and gave another grateful restaurant our business and actually sat for 3 hours.  According to the restaurant we ate at they had never heard of this apparent standard in Toronto restaurants either."}
{"text":"I really like this bar.  For a stretch of road (the Danforth) that is filled with restaurants and bars, I think this gets first place in my books, however the service could be slightly improved.  My wife and I will go up once a week or once every other week for pints and burgers.  The burgers are some of the best around - cooked to your liking and void of any grease - just natural flavouring with salt and pepper.  Anyway, we always sit at the bar and find the barman to be disinterested in any friendly chat with the patrons and, as was said in a previous post, we always are the one to wave him down to place an order, at least at the start of the evening.  He may pass by occasionally to see that we're satisfied or if we need a fill up on the drinks but not nearly enough for us to say - \"hey, we really like the staff at Allen's\".  For that reason, it's also a place I wouldn't think about venturing to for enjoying a pints and meal on my own.  For a neighborhood bar, I would expect a little more engaging from the staff.  Aside from that, the food is really really good.  There is an excellent selection of beers (more so in the can and bottle than on tap.).  If you like Lagers, go for the Allen's Lager (their house brand).  It's made by Amsterdam and is pretty decent.  The atmosphere is more mature and well-heeled than a lot of other places on the Danforth and the price reflects that."}
{"text":"Hostess is unbelievably rude. We sat down and realized we were late for an appointment so had to leave. Didn't mess up the table, didn't order anything and she gave us such attitude. Wanted to go back but will never step foot in that place again"}
{"text":"We've been to Allen's quite a few times and I've got to say the burgers are really, really good. It's the staff that are super arrogant, rude and quite simple couldn't give a crap if you come back or not. They give off the impression like it's a privilege to eat there and have a \"take it or leave it\" attitude.   My understanding is that restaurants are built on great customer service and repeat business. I guess I'll \"leave it\" and while they won't go bankrupt because I won't go their again, there will be point where people just stop coming back.   Maybe they should be grateful for the fact that they have repeat customers.....for now."}
{"text":"A large group of us came here for the festival of steak they have once a year and while it was very expensive it was also the best steak I have ever had in my life. My mouth waters just thinking about it.  I definitely need to go back for the next festival."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things one summer day so I tried it out. Sat on the patio. Took 15 minutes to get a pint of beer and then another 15 just to take my food order. Their burgers were dubbed 'best in the city'. Ordered Med Rare with cheddar and peameal. Arrived med-well with Swiss and no bacon. Waited 10 minutes to send it back. No one came so I ate it anyway. Bland with no seasonings at all. Still juicy but I've had better burgers at truck stops.   I returned a few weeks later to give it another shot. Sat down with my wife and told the hostess we'd probably only have drinks but to leave a menu just in case. Went to the bathroom and heard the hostess tell the server we'd just be having drinks. The server said: \"Good for them. They can sit there.\"  We left. I'll never darken their door again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always my first choice when someone asks me where I want to go for dinner. The burgers are my favourite thing on the menu, and with a lot of dietary restrictions, I know I can always trust that they'll be free of anything that can hurt me (although they do occasionally forget my request to have it without the bun). They have an excellent vegetarian curry for my long-suffering vegetarian friend, the Cesar is simple but tasty, and we go back every year for the steak festival."}
{"text":"Warm summer breeze whistling through soft willow leaves. Leaving you in a transcendence while you gaze at your beautiful date. Her perfectly pink manicured  fingers covered in a deep red sweet tangy but spicey sauce while her teeth dig into juicy crispy wings. I'm in love. I've never seen such beautiful wings.  Best wings I've ever had. No options on sauce choice but you won't need one.  Gorgeous patio too."}
{"text":"Saw a review below saying it was \"aiming for fine dining but it was nothing more than a pub\" and I couldn't agree more.  Went there with my girlfriend, sat on the patio which was actually really nice. Unfortunately we got the small table right by the door with a sideways tree pretty much in our faces. Servers knocked my back and chair with regularity which was annoying.  They are praised for their delicious burgers, they even have a paragraph on their menu outlining why they're the best in the city. Both of us got a burger, we split a side of fries (asked thin or thick cut, which was a pleasant surprise) and two drinks each (wine for her, a pint and a bottle of beer for me). After a standard 15% tip (which was relatively generous considering our 35 minute wait time and inconvenient seating location), our bill came to just under $100. For a mediocre burger and four drinks. Ridiculous.   Side note: If you're claiming to have the best burger in the city, don't make the fanciest thing about the meal the option for thick or thin cut fries. I expected some awesome sauce options, aioli's or obscure topping options.   Probably won't return, if I do it's only for their patio and I hope to heck to get a better seat."}
{"text":"Although famous for it's St-Patrick's Day shenanagans, the menu  during the other 364 days is now more Continental, although their beer list is extensive, they only serve Ontario wines. Had Sunday Brunch there recently which made an nice change. Use to have a nice large back patio, but unfortunately our recent wet Summer weather has made it impossible for me to re-visit. For a quiet or group drink go next door to a typical reproduction of a Irish pub - Dora Keogh. While it does not serve food, you can arrange to have a pre-selected group meal served privately in Dora's Kitchen"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had in a pub. We were bar hopping and we had great experiences at the other pubs along the Danforth...until we got to this one. I have never felt so unwelcome and I have never dealt with such a rude bartender. First of all, it took forever for us to even get a menu. When the bartender finally came back to us to ask what we wanted, I just asked one question and he said one second. Then he went to do a billion other things with other customers and finally, came back. Since this long period of time, I decided on a cocktail since I had been waiting forever to hear back about the answer to my question about what the prices were for the different types of tequila (since they listed the other alcohol prices on their menu and not their tequila). When the bartender finally came back with the tequila prices, I asked if I could actually have this cocktail (which was made with tequila). He said he had no idea what a Juan Collins was and he crushed up his piece of paper and stalked off and went to serve other customers. At this point, my party and me decided to just head out and continue our bar hopping at the next pub, which was such a refreshing change compared to this place. We were welcomed at the pub next door right away and served quickly. They were also really friendly."}
{"text":"In the past week I have been to Allen's 3 times. The first day we had champagne for a birthday toast in the morning, then a group of 3 of us met for lunch another day...then breakfast where It was time to shoot video and blog about it and make it a Daily GEM.  As soon as I walked in the staff were amazingly friendly and the patio blew me away how big and beautiful it was. The massive weeping willows stood tall protecting us from the heavy sun these hot days, and provided the best atmosphere by just being trees...but housing the birds that sang too.  I haven't tried a hamburger yet, but my friend did...and it looked awesome. Complementary fresh bread and real butter, very clean...even outside - and very well prepared food - with class.  If you go once...you will be back :)"}
{"text":"They have really good food , got some burgers, nice patio , servers I would say medium quality and not so friendly and not so cold or aggressive, the place is expensive but kinda worth it given the taste, it's not a place I would go to a lot."}
{"text":"Best Burger in the city! I enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, the staff was friendly. It was mid-November so I didn't get a chance to try the patio. But overall, I was very very impressed."}
{"text":"Been going to Allen's for longer than I can remember.  Love the back patio in summer!  Pretty much the best restaurant burger you can get without the insane price.  Also one of my favourite brunch spots on the Danforth."}
{"text":"The menu proclaims \"best burgers in Toronto\" -- not sure I agree. Sure, the burger itself was quite juicy and cooked perfectly (and unlike 99% of the other places in the city, they will cook it less than well done), but I found it too small and hockey-puck like. It should have covered more of the bun and been a little flatter.   Other negatives: The cheddar cheese was rather flavourless, and the presentation was lousy -- it was accompanied by a couple subpar looking tomato slices and a limp piece of lettuce. Plus, it doesn't come with anything on the side, so I had to shell out an extra $6 for sweet potato fries (which were, admittedly, very good).   On the plus side, calamari app was incredibly tender, although I didn't love the \"Mongolian fire sauce\" it came with -- a chipotle or garlic aioli would have been better. Great beer selection and great backyard patio.   It's tough to find good pub food in Toronto without all the ridiculous pub kitsch, and Allen's does that well, so I'll probably be back. But don't believe their claim about their burgers."}
{"text":"Allen's is a lovely place on the Danforth that's just affordable enough to frequent somewhat regularly while still being a treat. Easily one of the nicest places along this strip of the Danforth. The food is excellent and the owner is one of the nicest and most interesting restauranteurs I've had the pleasure of meeting. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Back patio is awesome, inside not so awesome.... so make sure you're seated on the back patio!  This place has an older crowd, so it's a good place to go for a date without worrying about Biff Knuckledragger and his friends being obnoxious and loud etc...."}
{"text":"I went to Allen's for the first time last night after hearing some good reviews over the years. We arrived at 4pm for a glass of wine/beer. The white-haired waiter told me that the Reisling I ordered was a \"4 or a 5... too sweet\", in spite of the the LCBO giving it a \"0\" rating. Within the next half an hour he came by twice to see whether we were ready to order dinner. No, not at 4:30 in the afternoon. Finally, he told us that our table was reserved for 6:30 and that we would have to leave by then. When my companion asked another person who worked there whether we could reserve a table, he was told they don't reserve tables on St. Patrick's Day.  My companion ordered a second beer and asked the waiter to recommend something. He did. I don't drink beer and I don't recall what it was but my companion tasted and said it was awful. I had a sip and if the perfumey scent wasn't enough to turn us off, the taste certainly was. He asked the waiter to please bring something else and I said, \"That is really weird tasting\". He walked off in a huff, saying, \"Thanks for saying I have weird taste!\" Pretty juvenile and very unprofessional.  I wanted to order the mussels but I asked first if they were a good size because of the time of year. His reply was, \"There's only one way to find out\". I took the chance and shouldn't have. They were fairly numerous but really puny.  My friend's meal was an Irish Wood Smoked Salmon with potato cakes, an expensive and very small serving.  The service was appalling."}
{"text":"Worst service there is. Waitress more interested in the tables beside us than ours. Food was okay but the service ruined our night. To avoid at all cost as there are better less pretentious pubs in town. Left without timing, the first time for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers, incredible beer selection (though many of the best choices are bottled, not on tap), and if you like bourbon/whiskey, this is your place.  Great ambience, fantastic fish 'n' chips.  A classy place without being high-brow or snooty.  They have standards, and the staff cares.  Can't say that for many places in TO."}
{"text":"Nice patio but do yourself a favour and try something else. The service so bad and the management couldn't care less. A bit pricey for two gourmet burgers and drinks at $ 80.00 but the hour and a half wait was clearly not worth it."}
{"text":"Allen's is a fantastic pub! It also has a great outdoor area in the back, which i have yet to use. The food is excellent. The service outstanding! Can't wait to go back. The owner, John Maxwell, who also owns Dora Keogh's next door is a great guy. Very accommodating and helpful. After a session next door, over to Allen's for dinner is a great way to spend an evening!  Forgot to add, it's also completely wheelchair accessible with an accessible washroom too!"}
{"text":"First time here and enjoyed the experience.  It helps that it was a warm night and they have a great patio.  Even a star sighting.  Draft beer selection could have been more extensive but all guests at our table were happy with the food.  I had the vegetarian curry (for meatless Monday) but would order the pork and apple pie the next time.  Staff were efficient but not overly friendly.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm so torn with Allens.  On one hand they do have a good bar with knowledgeable bartenders, complete with an extensive beer and wine list.  But on the other hand it seems like they are trying to be a snooty upscale restaurant.  The food is good and sometimes very good but they are not giving it away by any means.  They have a great patio out back which is worth checking out.  My biggest issue with Allens is the vibe.  The staff are either pretentious or disinterested and this seems to start right from the hostess (older lady) who I suspect is an owner.  The place just doesn't have a good vibe in my opinion.  This is a good pub (?) and worth checking out so you can decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Great patio in the back.  Nice place for a few drinks but the prices were insane (they clearly arent aiming for the middle class here).  The food wasn't that amazing either, was good but for the price *shrug*"}
{"text":"J'ai fréquenté cet établissement avec un grand ami pendant plus de vingt ans. Depuis que mon ami n'est plus, je n'y retourne guère mais les temps passés sont d'excellents souvenirs. Nous avons toujours été bien reçus par le propriétaire lui-même, John Maxwell, toujours souriant et amical. Si vous aimez le pub irlandais style New-York, c'est bien ici qu'il faut aller : vous aurez le choix entre des bières classiques et les whiskys les plus raffinés.   Le restaurant quant à lui est plutôt onéreux, mais toujours occupé ! Je n'ai eu l'occasion d'y manger que deux fois en 20 ans, mais chaque occasion fut parfaitement agréable. N'oubliez pas de commander les \"blackened potatoes\", une salade de pommes de terre chaude particulièrement relevée."}
{"text":"Amazing patio!!   Worth it for just the patio atmosphere.    Burger was slightly disappointing, but she ok."}
{"text":"I went here because I heard that they serve good burgers. It was a nice day, so we sat outside on their back patio. Felt like I was over a friend's house for a bbq -- it was a nice atmosphere. Decided to go with the aged cheddar burger and fries. The burger was great -- very juicy and fresh tasting. However, the patty was a bit too thick for my liking. I prefer a thinner patty, but that's ok because this burger was delicious! The fries were also really good. I'll be back for more.  Service on the other hand was slow. Slow to take our order, slow to bring our drinks and slow to bring the bill after we asked for it. I wouldn't come here if I was in any sort of a rush. They seem to have a good selection of drinks too which I'll order next time."}
{"text":"I am giving this grade solely based on their hamburger. I've been there twice and had their hamburger, the first time was a year or so ago and I remember really liking it, and definitely wanting to come back. Just went back there recently for the burger again, and it was probably better than I remembered it. I really quite loved it.  There are two types (if not three) of burgers, fast food style, and pub/gourmet (and maybe now smashburger which isn't really fast food but still not gourmet/pub-like). This is one of the best pub/gourmet burgers out there in the city. The price may definitely throw you off, 16 bucks with no sides... but when you eat the burger, and once you're done, I'm pretty sure you'll feel really satisfied enough not to need a side.  The sides are rather underwhelming anyway, the burger is clearly the star, medium rare. I cannot speak for the rest of the menu, but I'll most likely eat something else there once I'm tired of their burger."}
{"text":"I recommend arriving without reservations. That way, you have to wait a half hour at the bar, as I did last night, talk with the very knowledgeable and friendly barman and try out some local craft beer -- i did Maclean's, which was malty and good, my bitter wife loved her hoppy Collective Arts. Whatever you order, make sure you get the Irish soda bread --freshly baked in the back each day, and tastes like it too. There are lots of veggie options; i had a delicious, filling and protein-rich quinoa salad with ditto from black bean salad. My wife had exquisite pork -- econ friendly and high animal welfare standards, like most of the featured meats here. On local job creation grounds alone -- one of the pet themes of my e-book on Food for City Building, which I update research on in places like this --  this place deserves some kind of award for good corporate citizenship.   Wayne r"}
{"text":"In the mood for some pub grub, we ended up at Allen's. As we waited to be seated, we felt a bit ignored...  Sorry, I like smiles and warm welcomes!  But once we sat down, the service was attentive, they helped us hang our jackets and pulled our our chairs.  It's a nice pub, non-sticky floors, extensive beer list on the wall.  Fish and chips were tasty! Halibut wasn't over battered and the fries were crispy and golden.  Lamb pie was nice. Tasted like something someone's mom would make. But wasn't overly exciting.  I saw a little kid eating a burger. I wanted to take his burger. It looked delicious!  Overall, a nice place. A bit pricier than expected considering I was still hungry after my meal.  But I would return again to try some other things and have a pint."}
{"text":"We dropped by for a quick pint after dinner at Pizzeria Libretto (see other review). We had hoped to go to Dora Keogh's next door but it was closed, so settled on Allen's instead.  The decor is old world Irish pub with a hint of New York. There is lots of seating, either in booths, at the bar, in dining area or the huge patio out back. We settled on the bar and ordered two pints. My Mil Street Organic was flat and the bartender quickly changed it for a King Brewery Lager instead, which was much better.  The crowd here is definitely older than Dora Keogh's, and it's a lot quieter which can be a good thing if you're looking for a quiet pint. It was a Sunday night and wasn't so busy, so we finished our pints and paid up. Perhaps we caught them on an off night but I wouldn't rush back for the atmosphere or Irish 'craic' as there simply wasn't any.  A solid three stars for sure - decent but nothing that would blow your socks off."}
{"text":"By far my favourite burger in the city.  If you want a fresh burger, no fillers, Bbq'd then this is the place. Did I mention they do them cooked to order? The best burgers are pink in the middle. The beef is flavourful and cooked exactly how you like them, which for me is medium rare. Yum. My go-to burger is cooked medium rare with grilled onions and Danish blue cheese. It's always exactly what I want, juicy and flavourful. These burgers are by no means cheap, and they're not served with fries but they're well worth the price.  I tend to get an order of homemade sweet potato fries, delish with sour cream, on the side."}
{"text":"As promised, I'm revising the review based on now having had he hamburger. It's excellent, but a little disappointing you have to order the yummy sweet potato fries - or other chips - on the side."}
{"text":"Allen's has really good food, a great bar selection - including amazing Ontario wines - and an awesome patio for summer.  Go."}
{"text":"Allen's is known for it's burgers, or so it's menu says. However, after trying one of their famous burgers last night (a $16 privilege that includes exactly zero sides) I can safely say that it was one of the biggest casual dining disappointments I've experienced in Toronto. It's not that the burger is bad, it's just that there is no reason it needs to be sold at 25% premium when compared to most other competent pub or casual dining fare. Compounding the burger disappointment was terrible service. It took 15 minutes to be seated in a restaurant with lots of empty tables. The waiter rarely checked on us and it took forever for the food to arrive. It's not bad food, it's just overpriced and, in my experience, is delivered by staff that are in no hurry and don't seem to care about providing decent, let alone outstanding, service to patrons. Avoid."}
{"text":"There are a lot of great things about Allen's, but unfortunately service isn't one of them.  I came here last week with a friend who was visiting from out of town so we could sample the extensive beer list and enjoy one of the best patios this side of the bridge.  The host seated us on the patio and brought us lunch menus, even though it was almost 4pm; he told us we wouldn't be able to order from the lunch menu, except for a very small offering of BBQ'ed goods.  Then he left pretty abruptly, so we didn't have time to ask for the dinner menu.  I also want to mention it was a very hot day and the sun was directly overhead; he seated us in the sun, and we baked for about ten minutes until he returned to our table.  We asked if we could move to one of the free tables in the shade, and he mumbled something about having to check with a colleague, so we roasted for another ten minutes or so.  Finally he returned and sat us at a shady table.  (Throughout the meal we watched as he continued to seat other couples at the same broiler-table.  Each time they asked to move to cooler seats, and we made a game of guessing how long the couples would stick it out before asking to move.  I don't know why he kept sitting people there if they consistently complained. )  Another server came by to take our drink orders, and she was pretty unfriendly...didn't smile at all, and seemed kind of pissed off.  Actually, the staff in general seemed standoffish, and I got the impression they would rather be anywhere than taking my order.    As I mentioned above, they've got a great list of beers to choose from.  On such a hot day, it would have been nice if the chilled the glasses first though.  The food was great, but pretty pricey.  We had sweet potato fries, and the jumbo shrimp and scallop grill plate.  The seafood was cooked to perfection, not at all tough or rubbery, and beautifully plated (if this were Iron Chef, they'd get 5/5 for plating).  The prawns were HUGE.  Unfortunately for $40 or so, you only got two prawns and two scallops.  The dish also came with a plate of three salads (potato, Greek, mixed greens) which were tasty, but drenched in oil.  All in all I do like Allen's, and while I'm not going to become a regular, I'm sure I'll be back at some point.  I hope next time the staff makes me feel a little more welcome."}
{"text":"Very average meal and screwed up reservation: you can't reserve online, you must call them and listen to recorded detailed instructions about how to request a reservation. I did as instructed and then waited for the confirmation phone call. Instead, i got a message to call them as they had questions. I called them back and again got the recorded instructions and again left the same information as I had the night before. Later that evening they phoned back to confirm and then asked how many people there would be in my party! I had left this information TWICE already on their reservation system. So I repeated it for the 3rd time and the person said that my reservation was confirmed for 6pm. Just as i was hanging up, she asked if we expected to be done with our meal by 8pm as she needed the table for somene else which, on top of the inconvenience of calling twice to reserve and them obviously not listening to the details of my request, I found rude. The meal was very average. I ordered a ginger grilled striploin steak. It was a bit chewy and came on a bed of spinach with baked cubed sweet potatoes and some sort of sauce drizzled on top. That dish was $22 which I felt was overpriced. My husband had a burger which promptly fell apart as he tried to eat it with his hands. Our companion had a seafood dish consisting of a very small piece of grilled halibut which was almost completely obscured by the large amount of leafy greens on the dinner plate. Service was very good although we felt pestered at the beginning to hurry up and make a food choice....I guess because they wanted us gone by 8pm!"}
{"text":"I'll give Allen's one star for their burger and wings. When ordered medium rare the burger is juicy and delicious (when ordered medium it was significantly drier, I wouldn't be as excited if I liked my meat well done). It's rare to be able to find a place that makes their burgers so that you can order them medium rare. Their wings were saucy and delicious.  Another star for their patio. A sweet unexpected space.  That's all the stars they get.  One point off for charging for lettuce on the burger. That's just cheap. Want fries with your burger? That will be \"about $5\" extra. One off for the price! Everything was really over priced here, and as I mentioned above you feel really nickled and dimed over every bite. I paid $45 for a pint, a salad, and my share of some wings and fries.  One point off for how poor that salads ordered were. Both the niscoise and the goat cheese salad were severely lacking. The niscoice was just a hard boiled egg, a tomato, and a handful of green beans. No lettuce, no presentation. Nothing. Barely any food. And the tuna that was served with it was overcooked. The goat cheese salad was under dressed, with two puny pieces of goat cheese. For $16 I expect more.   One point off for rude service. The older gentlemen who served us was rude and snipppity from the very beginning. Yes, we were a large group, but we made a reservation, so it was known that we were coming. Our table was not ready for us, we had to wait about 40 minutes to add the last table to seat everyone. No one lit our candles, we had to do it ourselves. Our waiter was not helpful in recommending beers from their extensive menu, and he consistently gave the impression that he wished we were not there. We spent $600, and left feeling like we were an annoyance to him. I don't think any of us will be back."}
{"text":"They are trying to be fine dining when they are nothing more than a pub.  My first and likely last visit to this \"joint\". When you walk in, it looks like a regular old pub. Prices are sky high with service, presentation and food being mediocre at best. My guess as to why they seem to be popular is that there aren't many non-Greek places to choose from in the area.  The host is right out of a mafia movie ... oh, and if you tell him you'll be eating, he'll allow you on to his patio: otherwise, no patio for you!  Unless you're looking for an average experience with over-priced fare, go anywhere else ... anywhere."}
{"text":"Why is this place so busy? The  server was far too busy to provide good service even if she wanted to. Burgers were okay. Halibut was over fried with a heavy batter and a lot of grease. Yukon Gold fires (oh that sounds special) were just warm and I suspect had been sitting around for a while before being plated. Not a cheap place either. Summertime and the backyard BBQ has been a much better experience in the past. We will consider returning then."}
{"text":"Allen's is an Irish pub with a great restaurant with a sweet tree-covered patio.  They have a wonderful wine list of VQA wines (they only carry wines from Ontario) with quite a few by the glass and an excellent whiskey collection as well as a number of beers on tap.  It has a great community vibe and I love sitting at the bar but there are also a few tables in that area as well as tables in the restaurant and patio that can be reserved."}
{"text":"Ended up here after the place we wanted to try was closed (even though the website stated otherwise) For a Monday the place was packed especially the patio section. Heck its summer and Canadian really know how to enjoy their summers! We waited a bit and were seated at the patio after 10-15 minutes wait. The patio was packed. I luved the selection for hard liquors as it was almost two pages long with a small font! price range was anywhere from $ to $$$$! I stuck to beer. Beer selection is decent if you go by the bottle for draft its OK. I already had had supper before so wanted to stick to a liquid diet :) friend ordered a peameal burger and was surprised all the sides and toppings were extra! had a Corona. I just luv Unibrue and couldn't resist Blache de Chambly on draft. The server asked my friend how he wanted his burger cooked, a rarity as that mean they grind their meat fresh and make the burger in house. The main purpose of this visit was to enjoy our cigars and and have decent drink. We asked the server specifically if we can smoke in the patio. The burger took its time. The server was attentive and kept checking on us.  Now for the bad part half way through our cigars he comes and says you can't smoke a cigar here! really why not You can smoke a cigarette full of nasty additives but not a natural product like cigar so we puffed on our cigars and finished them fast. Apparently you can smoke them in the front patio area but not the back! Finally the burger arrived looked very good. After a while though it got really soggy and greasy as my friend commented he has had much better burgers for far less. Total damage with 3 beers and a main was around 50$all in. Hmmm makes me wonder. I liked the beer selection so 4 stars for that though they could have used more Belgian style stuff, for food as per my friend 2 star so average is 3. I am going to deduct half a star for not allowing cigars yet cigarettes are ok. 2.5 Stars though I can see why this place is so popular."}
{"text":"Went with Mr Handsome and our eldest son, really enjoyed the atmosphere out back on the patio, even though it was super hot outside we were very comfortable due to the gorgeous huge trees, we started with Bloody Mary's and a Caesar, which were just alright, nothing fancy and no salted rims;  this is an Irish pub so they're not super concerned with cocktails  The food is excellent,  they serve grass fed beef and the burgers were delish,  hubs had the fish and chips - the wild halibut was so thick and meaty and of course the fries were perfect!  This is the only pub I know of that serves fresh squeezed grapefruit juice so I was able to enjoy a real Greyhound for the first time in years. Everything is housemade and organic when possible. ..we'll definitely return"}
{"text":"Interesting New York Irish steak house in the middle of the Danforth. Its quite the ambiance, especially on St Patrick's Day. I had the burger here, which was quite nice and not too greasy. The prices are a bit steep though.  The Atmosphere and service is quite nice and apparently they have one of the best selections of Scotch in the whole city."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have already been here quite a few times with friends and everyone has loved it so far. They have a huge selection of beers and have some interesting options on tap. The waiters are dressed in dress shirts and black ties and very friendly. Hands down the best patio on the the Danforth.  The best thing on the menu for me has to be the burger. Made from local Ontario meat cooked perfectly juicy and flavorful. You can order them plain or with a side of cheese. They do not skimp on the cheese and the sides (pickles, lettuce, tomato and mustard). The herbed goat cheese dip and polenta rosemary chips were great. There's almost always more dip so order more bread. Will definitely come back here often."}
{"text":"They have a great beer selection, delicious food and - hands-down, unquestionably the best patio in the city for quiet hang-time."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at the bar years ago as I worked across the street and we'd duck in for a change of atmosphere after work. The Danny, especially west of Pape, is a hood where the bars are heavily populated by those who live or work there. There seems to be a ferocious loyalty between the servers/barmen and those who frequent any given Danny pub. I no longer work/live in this hood. Maybe that accounts for the poor service.  When I slipped in for a drink a few months ago, the barman knew were there, but didn't even come over to offer us a drink. He literally waited for us to beckon him over. Now, I like my drinks. And any smart bartender can tell this as soon as I sit down for my first. If he can keep me there for more than that one, he'll make some good coin off me. I love the chatter of a neighbourhood bar and the way in which people open up and chat after a few. Or simply keep to themselves and let others wonder.  The wine list is constructed completely of local wines. It's nice to showcase what Canada has to offer, but the selection is ridiculous. Literally 100 + wines from around Niagara and Prince Edward County. Looks more to me like the owner likes the kickbacks from places he can visit. It's just too much from one small spot on the map in the world of wine.  The Maitre D' was a very unpleasant woman who seemed to take great pleasure in reminding us that since my friend and I had a baby carriage, we'd have to be out of the dining room by 6 pm. (It was 4:00 and we had already told her we were just having a quick drink.) No need to remind us that we have to leave in 2 hours.  Everyone raves about the burgers here. They're fine but he food is definitely expensive. And for the price the burger should include a side.  Points for a great patio, and generally, wonderful bar chatter, but the middle section with blue checked table cloths leaves me cold. Maybe I have to move back and become more easily recognizable to the staff. I once loved this place, but now I'll leave it alone until a bit of nostalgia hits."}
{"text":"A friend of my bf's recommended the food at Allen's, especially their burgers. Upon arriving, the restaurant was busy and we were waiting to be greetfed and sat. But no one approached us. So I went looking for an employee and the manager finally ended up greeting me. When I asked for a table for four, he looked at me up and down and told me I was looking for the bar next door. I was confused, since it's a different pub next door. So I took his advice and went next door, thinking it was the same restaurant. But it was clearly a different establishment and there were no proper tables to have dinner. So we went back to the restaurant, and my friend asked fora table. He was about to help her out, until he noticed that I was with her. His demeanor changed and said that there was no space for us and that we had to go next door, even though there was an open table that's been free since the first time we walked in. He claimed it was \"reserved\". Which is fine, except he didn't even try to accomodate us by waiting at the bar for a free table or putting us on a wait list. He just wanted us out. The four of us are young professionals and we were dressed casual, so there was no reason to not want us in there. This is the first time we have ever been discriminated against. Not ever coming here again."}
{"text":"I went to Allens with a group of friends and was very impressed with the patio and the food.   First the patio was large enough to hold over 100 people easily and it had some very cool old trees growing up through the fence which gave it a very neat, secluded feel. If it were any colder though I wouldn't have wanted to be outside and I wasn't a huge fan of the interior (hence the 4/5 stars) since it seemed more like a pub and didn't reflect the middle to upscale menu offering and prices.  We all had burgers since it seemed like the thing to do (the menu gives a story of them buying their own cow each week and grinding up all the meat themselves) and they were a little on the pricey side at $13 for just the burger, no cheese or sides, but it was by far the best burger I've had in Toronto and the beer menu had at least 40 options so there were plenty of drinks to wash it down with :).  I would absolutely go back if it were a nice sunny day and there was room on the back patio. If it wasn't I would probably try another place rather than sit inside."}
{"text":"Allens has been a great place for many years.  But on Father's Day, it was awful.  Steaks were grey.   Eggs were runny. Toast was plain Demster's bread that was not toasted, not warmed, not buttered, just touched with a few grill marks. The fries were so scant that i counted mine: 12 fries!  One dish simply never arrived.  And for this lackluster meal, we waited over an hour even though the place was not very busy."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighbourhood for 16 years and didn't start coming here until this summer. I guess I always thought they were too fancy just to drop in. I'm happy I popped in and now I dine here more frequently.   My first visit I tried the burger. I was really impressed with the write up in the menu about the quality of the meat and preparation. The most I've ever paid for a burger but SSOOOO worth it! Juicy, tasty and cooked to perfection!   My new favourite addiction is the halibut fish and chips. I truly believe this IS the BEST fish and chips in the city! The fish is always fresh, you can taste it! The batter is perfection, thin and not greasy. The fries are hand cut and yummy but I'm on a diet now and get a salad instead. I come once a month just for the fish and chips.   Last night I had the seafood chowder: wild halibut, wild salmon, wild tuna and shrimp in a light creamy bowl of yumminess! Loved it. And for the first time ever I tried Irish Soda bread that came with it. Made in house and so yummy. I ate all of eat and the diet says no bread but I couldn't resist! Ha! You can buy a loaf from them too!   The staff have always been friendly and professional when I've been there. When I ask about something they always take the time to answer me, even when they have a full house. The bathroom is downstairs, for anyone with accessibility issues. I think the prices are fair for the quality and quantity of food you get."}
{"text":"I've been to Allen's what now feels like a million times, but we were in on Monday because it was a co-worker's birthday. And at my office that means a meal at Allen's, and yes, you are absolutely allowed to order the steak. I have had lots and lots of long boozy dinners here.  The funny thing about this place that you will either like or not like, is that they are actually relatively formal about their service. They have very high standards about their beers and food - but the atmosphere is decidedly casual. The dichotomy is odd sometimes! But I like it, and I like their patio in the summer even more. There is a massive willow and at magic hour it is pretty magical back there. Also sometimes in the summer they have had free wine tasting at dinner, which can also turn things towards magical.  Anyways, most recently I had  their homemade bread (which is delicious and unchanged in like seven years) to start, and then a burger with swiss and sauteed mushrooms, half and half yam and potato fries on the side. It is indeed one of my favourite burgers in town.  I've also had their Friday night steaks on multiple occasions and they are always great pieces of meat. I find that they do fish less well.  Their scotch selection remains excellent, with lots of bottles brought back personally from scotland by the owner. If you ask them if they have \"The Michael Jackson Book,\" they might produce a copy for you to go through while you order scotch.  They have one of my favourite microbrews, King Pilsner. They also have good espresso.  Summer night parking on the Danforth is not great to deal with so I usually just park at the Green P around the corner - and it's a hop-skip from the subway station as well."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the city. Definitely.  Patio is lovely, you almost forget youre in the bustle of Toronto.  The atmosphere is great too...what I think of as a typical East End attitude.  Laid back, a mix of young and old, couples and families, groups and pairs.   My only beef:  Last time I was here, I had a great salad with grilled chicken breast.  I went back, about a month later and recommended the salad, or what i presumed to be the same salad, to a friend.  But it had changed! Instead of a full grilled chicken breast, there was only a half breast meagerly chopped atop.  They forgot the dressing and brought it on the side.  The salad definitely went down hill. If their other food is going down hill as well, this might get a quick decrease in rating."}
{"text":"So many reviews of this place suggest the same thing... and yet somehow I expected a different experience. The staff here are friendly and fairly efficient. The food here is mediocre and overpriced. The ingredients of what my partner and I had (fish and chips; lamb) seemed very fresh and high quality but somewhere along the line things fell flat. This is the kind of bland fare that once fell under the label  \"fine dining,\" but that decade is long gone and those of us who know seasoning involves more that salt and pepper deserve better for our dollar."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks, but I wouldn't eat here again.  PATIO: 5 Stars SERVICE: 4 Stars FOOD: 1 Star PRICE: 2 Stars  I almost gave this joint 3 stars until I remembered that they charged me for lettuce and tomato on my burger.  Dude, that is a GARNISH. Nobody in their right mind actually puts a vegetable on their burger.  It's supposed to be there to fool you into thinking that you're eating healthy. Seriously, is this really going to make an impact on your bottom line? GRRR.  I went here with the Yelp crew and we initially took a table in the back patio.  The sun wasn't quite out of the way yet so we were a bit hot.  Soon afterward, it started to look like rain so we asked for an inside table and they graciously agreed.  The service was friendly, fairly fast and professional all evening.  I'd heard \"Best Burger in the City\" several times, so I had to give it a shot.   One of my secrets to a happy life is to always keep your expectations low.  So with all the great reviews on here and the CM of Yelp telling me how amazing the burger was, my expectation levels were off the charts.  Ordered Medium, it came out well.  Very well.  Thick, well, and dry.  Someone else at our table ordered their burger well and it came out bloody!  Initially we thought they may have confused our orders, however she hadn't ordered cheese or the expensive garnishes.  This is an ordinary pub food burger and nothing more.   Overall the location, service and patio were above average.  I didn't hear anyone discussing their food however.  I'd highly recommend it for drinks though."}
{"text":"Great irish pub with above average food. The burgers are fantastic here, fresh chuck in a hefty patty and grilled to order-though the bun could be a little sturdier. Aside: not a fan of wimpy buns! Fish and chips are good as well, fresh halibut in a crispy batter and homemade tartar sauce which is always a plus. The prices are a little more than usual pub fare but the quality is there. Service can be a little frazzled or stretched at times though as this  place gets packed quickly. They have a good selection of brewskis and if you are lucky enough to get a seat on their gorgeous patio take it!"}
{"text":"Went to Allen's the other day for lunch with a colleague and was pretty impressed overall. LOTS of beer options both on tap and on bottle so that was nice. Very nice patio with overhanging trees that makes you appreciate the natural beauty that is the East-end/Danforth.   Burgers are well known across the city, a bit pricey but so is everything at Allen's. Burger was delicious but doesn't come with a side just a heads up. Good place for casual eats not so much for a date night though in my opinion."}
{"text":"I recently visited Allen's for one of their infamous burgers and I truly do wish that I could have rated it a bit higher.  The service was amazing, the beer and wine list extensive, the ambiance spot on, and although we weren't fortunate enough to see the back patio-I have seen pics and it looks amazing.  However the burger was a bit steep in terms of price-point for the quantity....and I know that there are many that will argue that it's quality over quantity, and I agree to an extent, but I just didn't see how the 13.95$ for a stand-alone burger is justifiable, it would have to be exceptional.  Was it good...yes.  But would I pay 13.95$ for it again, probably not.  With that said, this review is based solely on my burger experience and nothing more.  Will I go back to Allen's- absolutely.  I think that they are definitely worthy of another visit, and this time I will try and time it for patio season!"}
{"text":"I don't mind paying for good food and I over tip for excellent service (20% when it is exceptional). This place is generally rude. If you get one of the good wait staff or eat at the bar it's much better. The communication between the wait staff and the kitchen is poor. The blonde woman who is hostess ?management on duty is rude, unhelpful and argumentative, if you can get her attention. I've ordered the black bean soup and it has come cold 3 times; the first time I asked them to heat it up it came back fiery spicy and luke warm. I brought my mother in there and we were ignored for 20 minutes so we left. I've been to Burns night several times and it's the only time the place/food/staff has been up to par. I've had burned food with arguments and hostility from said hostess when I pointed it out. I much prefer Globe Bistro's bar menu and wait staff."}
{"text":"Went there prior to an event next door at the Danforth Music Hall. It was fairly busy but not crazy when we arrived and got busier AFTER we ordered but took 30-35  minutes for the sub standard overpriced food to come to our table. The sever was too inexperienced to manage the organization required in a busy environment and failed to even remember beers we requested and was never around checking on our status and whether we were ok with our order. Total fail! And the food is so bland and non- exceptional it betrays the over priced cost they charge. Only in Toronto would an unorganized valueless place like this survive for so long. AVOID!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has such great reviews- it was overpriced, the food wasn't that great, no sides came with the burgers at almost 20$!, and the service sucked. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"After my last post (about No Bull Burgers) i referenced both Allen's and BQM, so I only thought it fitting to review Allen's burger.    When they say on their menu that many people consider this to be the city's best burger they aren't kidding!  Their beef is from Cumbrea and if you are familiar, Cumbrea are the real deal - the meat in your burger is from one animal and is cooked to perfection (for the most part - i've had one issue with them getting it wrong).    It's not cheap and it doesn't taste it either, if you love a flamed grilled burger and like it rare to medium, this is the place for you; OUTSTANDING BURGER and lots of great beer to go with it!  If you like it well done - don't waste your money because you just spoiled a good thing (if you like it cooked all the way through eat chicken)."}
{"text":"I experienced this place for the first time years ago with my boyfriend and his parents. They suggested the spot for it's homey pub feel and excellent food and huge beer list. One of my favourite items was the curry chicken, but they removed that from the menu. However the burgers and many of the apps like the calamari and the quesadillas are delish. I would love to give this place a higher rating but ever since I've started going here, whether with my boyfriend, his parents, or my own girlfriends I have not once recieved 'good' service. I dont know if it's because my servers take one look at my table and immediatley judge us as 'not worth their time' or because their systems are inefficient or they are simply sub par servers, no idea why. But the service always leaves me feeling so unvalued as a patron and almost an annoyance. If there is one thing I wish Allen's would successfully improve on is better service. The last time I was there my server was so weeds. She buzzed about us, and was very short in her attendance. Upon finishing up our appetizer she grabbed our plate and asked us if we were done, of which we responded not yet, then abruptly dropped the plate back on the table with a clang. I was so jarred by this I refused to talk to her for the rest of my evening. Once most of her tables had left and she had time for us she tried to redeem herself by talking to us more. It worked a bit and we left her a casual 15%. Sadly, I've come to accept this lack of quality in service and will return to Allen's at least once or twice every year. I know, I'm not helping the issue."}
{"text":"Met a friend of mine at Allen's on the Danforth around 6:15 PM. Entered without a reservation and the place was about half full. Was informed that I could have a table until 8:15 PM. When I inquired as to why - the terse host said \"we have a lot of reservations tonight\".   I've always found this an odd way to have someone start the night. I didn't make a reservation (my bad) but there's so many better ways to handle that situation. \"We may be full later on sir and we may need to move you\" or \"would you be okay sitting at the bar as we are fairly full tonight\", etc. Instead he basically said \"you have two hours and then please get out\". He never smiled once throughout the entire transaction.  The server made up for it droves, kind and energetic she took great care of us and when I told her we were told that we needed to vacate the table at 8:15 PM -- she said \"don't worry about it we are not that busy tonight\". This actually made it more frustrating because as I looked around the room she was right it was 3/4 empty. So the host basically created a less than great experience just because he could - he had power over me - and he exerted it. The food ? We started with the calamari which was great and my friend had a burger on my recommendation -- I decided to try the halibut and chips, which was a mistake. The breading was chewy (tasted liked it was microwaved) the fish was dry (overcooked) - but the burger was awesome so my second mistake of the night. the yukon fries are always awesome.  What I learned. Make a reservation if you can. Sometimes people will make your life difficult if they can and stick with what you know (burger). The amazing server made up for a hosts poor decision but advice for any restaurant,  always value the customer you have in front of you as much as the customer who may or may not ever show up."}
{"text":"I've only been once but my impression was that this is a great place to grab a drink, especially a beer, on this side of the Danforth.  Note that they don't stay open until typical closing time. (2am)  Also note, as I've found with a date, that you probably won't get in on a busy Friday night without any reservation.  They will send you next door which is a fine substitute.    The feel in Allen's is...\"old timey\" and upscale-ish.  I seem to recall checkered table cloths.  It was easy to imagine it as a scene for gangsters doing a deal in the 40s.  I am unsure if this would work for a pubcrawl unless you had just a few people in your group.  It also seemed to be a place for the late 30s+, and well into the 50s, crowd.  I think there were TVs--really not sure if this is the best place to watch a game or not.  It did have a \"local\" feel to it as a place that mostly locals go.  Prices seemed fair--$33 for 2 pints and 2 glasses of wine.  Service was totally fine.  We were left alone but never without liquid in our glasses.  Am really curious to try the food.  Very recommended if you are on this side of the Don!"}
{"text":"Allen's is an upscale pub with an extensive beer list, a nice patio, and good service. On the other hand, the food isn't the greatest; it's got an extensive menu of pub favorites that have a fancier twist, but I definitely wouldn't call this a gastropub.   The burger was egregiously bad. Bone dry, and on the bill there were separate charges for lettuce and tomato. Who does that? That's so bizarre! The Guinness-braised lamb shank was better -- fall off the bone tender, though I wish it ha been even more so.  I also liked the accompanying champ (mashed potatoes and scallions).   I was very happy with their riesling and pinot grigio choices, which were perfect for the end of a steamy summer day. However, when the sky threatened rain, our server was very nice and accommodating about our request to move inside.  All in all, Allen's offers a nice atmosphere but the price of the food is rather high considering you're still just getting your standard pub fare. I'd go to Allen's again, but I'll stick to the drinks next time."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had at a bar in Toronto. Allen's and Dora Keogh's next door are both owned by the same family and both pubs are winners in my book.   You'll probably want reservations to eat in the dining room here, which is dressed up similar to cookie cutter NYC Irish pubs - blue checkered tablecloth, bar in the front, patio in the back. There are also a few seats out front next to Danforth Music Hall. Casual and busy on the weekends.   We sat at the bar and enjoyed wonderful pints of Guiness, but also split an amazing burger with Irish/Canadian bacon, melted cheese and Carmelized onions. It was really, really good. Don't hesitate if you're on the fence. The chips were large and fried nicely. I doused mine in vinegar and salt. The rest of the menu is kind of upscale - filets, lamb, seafood...but it all looked lovely and judging by the crowds, tastes pretty good too. I like this neighborhood on the east side of the city. Urban but not business-like. Check out Allen's if you're out this way and enjoy Guinness and burgers."}
{"text":"I went to this wonderful spot on the Danforth on a beautiful summer Sunday for brunch and it was really quite amazing. The backyard patio is fantastic; ample and comfortable seating, a gorgeous view and a fantastic weeping willow to keep you company while you eat.   I had the French toast made with brioche and bacon strips and it really hit the spot. The toast was fried and the inside was still a little gooey - topped off with some maple syrup it was simply delicious. The bacon was a great addition too as its saltiness set off the sweetness of the French toast perfectly.   I had tried some eggs bennie and they were scrumptious - nice and tart with some lemon juice i the hollandaise. They serve fage - fried potato with parsley - on the side and it is absolutely delicious.  Coffee refills were frequent and their homemade orange juice was delectable. If you like a good brew, they also have a HUGE list of beers written on a chalkboard on the patio. It's definitely a place I plan on frequenting again."}
{"text":"I've heard of Allen's before through friends but have never actually been until last week. Went there for dinner and drinks and what a great experience I had.   The place felt very welcoming even though it was a packed house. The music was set at the right volume where you could have proper conversations without having to scream and shout. The staff there were extremely nice, attentive and knowledgable of the menu.   We ordered the wings and mussels as our apps and I got the burger as my main, and everything tasted delicious. The wings only come in one flavour but it was really good. I go for wings all the time but these wings here stood out to me as they were not heavily battered and were cooked to perfection - really juicy!  Now on to the main. Let me tell you that the burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had! It's cooked to your preference (I got medium) and it came out perfectly pink. It was a good size and very very juicy. It was a little messy to eat but don't tell me you've had an amazing burger that didn't make a mess. There's no such thing as a good burger that makes no mess.   There are many options on the menu that I want to come back and try. What makes it difficult for me, is that I know I'm going to eye that burger every time I come back.  I've also heard that they have an incredible patio. Can't wait to check it out in the summer. Definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Three friends and I were in the area to for a show at the Danforth music hall so Allens was the perfect choice. We went in and were seated at a booth with the caveat that we could only have the booth until 6 (roughly 2 hours) which we thought was plenty of time. The menu looked great it was steak fest and there was a great selection of beer and spirits. However that was it and also the source of the one star. We sat there for half an hour. The bartender looking at us occasionally and waitstaff walking right by without even a pause. So off we went to a pub down the road where we were immediately seated and brought drinks. Allens may be good but they seem to be selective as to who they serve."}
{"text":"Very impressive beer selection and awesome backyard patio. A great place to have a few drinks on a weeknight or lush Sunday afternoon. Sadly the food is pretty mediocre however."}
{"text":"LOVE THEIR PATIO!  This place has one of the nicest patios in Toronto.  Who wouldn't want to enjoy a pint of their favourite beer under the canopy of the two majestic trees they have.  The tables are well spaced out, the patio is enormous and they could easily pack another 5 or 6 tables back there, but they chose not too and this makes that space all the more comfortable and inviting.  They have built-in seating surrounding the trees, so you can't help but feel like you're in someone's fabulous backyard.  Their beer list is extensive and their wine offerings are impressive as well.  Service was quick and our waitress was friendly.    One thing of note...we had visited another pub earlier in the evening and we're given a list of \"don'ts\" before our server would even take our order, due to \"by law restrictions\" and yet 4 doors down, those restrictions  (no tables of more than 6 ppl, tables couldn't be moved) somehow magically disappeared at Allen's.   To be fair, I didn't try their food, but I'm basing this review on my beer drinking enjoyment and this place was near perfect.  I'll update the review once I've tried their food."}
{"text":"The food is decent and the patio in the back is a great spot for drinks in the summer. The major issue I have with this place is the service. The attitude from the servers, especially one of them in particular, is absolutely horrendous. You are made to feel unwelcome and as though you are an absolute annoyance. I've given this place a few chances and have received the same type of service every time. I will never go back. There's many other places to go with better food and WAY better service."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see servers in white dress shirts and black ties, having gotten a very pub-y feel from Allen's website and their frontage. When you crack open the menu, you're hit with some very high-end looking entrees (specials), but at very high-end prices...which made me a bit nervous about what the burgers - which I was excited about - would cost. Surprise! The burgers are all right in the $15-range, what I consider a standard non-fastfood burger price.  We picked up the Goat Cheese Dip with Garlic Toast to start - while the dip was fantastic and the bread was great, they really didn't give you enough bread to fully enjoy the dip. But that's pretty nitpicky.  I'd say the burger itself lived up to its reputation. I got the one with goat cheese - it came with a chunk of goat cheese the size of the burger patty itself, crisp lettuce, pickles, fresh-looking tomatoes, and this potent horseradish mustard that I loved. Plus, since they prep all their own beef, you have the option of how you want your burger cooked. I ordered mine medium and it was perfect - juicy and flavourful.  Despite the awesome burger, the REAL thing that will bring me back is the patio in the back. The decor gives it a really cool vibe, and you get a decent amount of sun into the evening. I also REALLY appreciate that it's not overcrowded. Even with all the tables full, you're not shoulder-to-shoulder with every other customer.  Our service was slow, but as I mentioned, they were completely full. We weren't in a hurry, our server was really nice, and everything came out perfect, so it didn't particularly bother me."}
{"text":"Wow this place has great food, and holy awesome patio! If you want a patio that is really spacious and isn't crowded, yet still gorgeous, look no further.  Food is fantastic, I've been 3 times and every time it was just stellar. The burgers were fantastic, probably the best I've had in the city.  But yes it's pricey. Too pricey if you ask me. I'll take a point away just for that.  But still it's a great little joint, good selection of beer, friendly staff, amazing food.... and a great patio. Cheers."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! (Well, mostly.)  Great courtyard for dining, open late. The menu had a number of things that were very appealing but in the end I went with fish and chips and it was THE BEST fish and chips I've ever had. The halibut was so incredibly tender, breading to die for too. Great homemade fries. Everyone was nibbling off of my plate! My friends ordered some items - can't remember what other than some kind of soup and the bruchetta. Everyone was so thrilled with taste and presentation. No complaints at all about the food. Service on the other had...  Our waiter was just bad. All around, bad. Rude to us from jump-street, unprofessional as can be, and seemed to really hate his job/life. Because of him and how much he put a damper on our experience (it was my friend's birthday too) we shortened our stay (and he lost money for the place because we would have stayed for a couple more drinks had he not been such a douche). Because of him, I have to take off one star.   I will absolutely be back and next time hope to have service that matches the menu!"}
{"text":"Allen's is an institution on Danforth I keep forgetting about. The backyard patio with a giant tree is surprisingly as spacious as the vintage toned cinematic, well aged feels-like-imma-in-a-1940s-tavern insides. It's a pub with a bit of an upscale casual bent to it, at least when it comes to the grub it serves, where it aims to deliver a gourmet food experience instead of mere usual pub fare.  Maybe it's a bit over-the top that there's a thesis statement on the quality of their ingredients on some of the many items on their hefty menu. Maybe it's a way of saying we're no college dive bar; it's a place you can bring a date, have a family lunch or run a small casual meeting at--the mature sense of the business is palpable. On that sense the service is generally great and accommodating; the prices a notch above affordable though.  They got pizzas and fish and chips and such. The decent burgers are small but tall A.F. And they got an insanely extensive beer list that spans several chalkboards.  But yeah, the popular patio. More like a big-ass homey backyard of a relative's place and you're expecting steaks fresh off the grill.  {TTC: Broadview subway station; it's pretty much adjacent to the Danforth Music Hall}"}
{"text":"2 things about Allen's should bring you here:  Their abundant beer selection and out/indoor patio. We came here at around 10 on a Wednesday.  The place was not too packed and we grabbed a seat on the back patio.    Along the back side wall, they have 4 blackboards with about  80 beers, organized by their type and region. The patio is pretty cool because the ground is covered in hardwood and naturally hundred year old elm trees sprout in the middle of it.  During the daytime this patio would probably be great because of the natural tree shade, however during the night I feel that their lights are too bright and should be much dimmer.  Only 2.5 stars because the service is pretty slow. We had to flag down a server every time we need a refill and I saw a couple other tables being frustrated for the same reason.   Edit:  I came here a 2nd time and the service was still slow and they forgot stuff or to comeback multiple times. I also had a chance to order some food. I have no idea why I paid $17.99 for a plate of Chicken Curry , but I did it anyway.  It was alright, and had a good mix of spices, but did not justify it being that expensive.  Glass of cider and chicken curry should not come up to over $35 after tip."}
{"text":"I had been to Allens once on a friday night just for a night cap, and the packed atmosphere definately reminded me of Ireland. But I really enjoyed the Brunch I had there a few months later. I got eggs with sweet potato hash, and it came with a bisquit instead of toast. I'm normally not a fan of sweet potatoes but I loved this! The eggs were great and the coffee was free flowing. Bummer was we couldn't eat in their amazing looking patio because of a wedding party (great idea!) but I hope to go back sometime soon to enjoy the patio. Highly recommmend brunch!"}
{"text":"We stopped going because of the snark and had way better service at the Auld Spot down the street. I was surprised at how much the food has gone down hill on my first visit in more than a year. We waited an hour between the apps and dinner and the server suggested that maybe the maitre de would comp a couple of glasses of wine(her suggestion), she returned to say nope. Every time I go there I say never again. While this isn't by far the worst experience I've had at Allens (and there have been many), yet ONE more reminder I never need to return. The food used to be reliable. Definitely not even that any more. Try the Auld Spot!"}
{"text":"Why do people insist this is a good burger?  Better yet, why are people afraid to say its NOT GOOD!  You insist on my burger being pink inside. And I Insist that I'd rather not get E Coli.  A pink burger does not make a tasty burger.  END OF STORY.   You know the fat that melts off a burger?  That is this amazing liquid that when touches your tongue gives your palate an orgasm.  Well Guess what?   Your pink burger has non of that because it hasn't even reached a proper temperature to melt that fat.     What a garbage place!  What a garbage burger!"}
{"text":"After all these years, still the best burger in Toronto.  Especially good with strip bacon and aged cheddar.  Wings are excellent too, with real blue cheese in the dip.  Never tried anything else here.  No need to.  Great Belgian Beer selection."}
{"text":"We're always on the hunt for a knock your socks off burger and I think we found it!! This place is such a hidden gem. Looks like a regular ole' bar from the front but when u walk in, there's a beautiful backyard patio that is so homey and inviting you never wanna leave! The food was excellent, however service was pretty slow and my server really wasn't quite pleasant. But the food made up for that I suppose. We had goat cheese dip, burgers and fries. Their burgers are ridiculously amazing. Best burger in TO. Beer was awesome. Wide selection which I always appreciate. Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"For me, it's all about the beautiful back patio. That said, Allen's has some excellent food.  I've experienced some snooty attitude from the Maitre D'. But overall, I like the joint.   A few food highlights: Flavourful, freshly spiced curries, lovely grilled sweet potatoes with lime sauce, and the Blacked Potato Salad is rich and scrummy. Good burgers, great grilled meat if that's your thing. They have a lovely beef stew with potatoes.  I've had the grilled salmon with potatoes and spinach and mustard sauce and found it bland and uninspired."}
{"text":"Allen's fills a niche: a pub atmosphere with a white linen bent. It's the kind of place you can bring a date for a pint but also a nice dinner. Don't look for pub grub on Allen's menu. It's fine eating without the Financial District price tag. Heck, they even hide the fact they serve burgers. It takes a sharp eye to see they have burgers quasi-off menu.   They did have a fish and chips pub staple on the menu. I was pretty disappointed. It was a small bit of flesh covered in a huge whack of batter. The batter was over rich. You know when something is so deep fried that it starts to tickle your throat on the way down and almost invokes a gag reflex? The fries are tops, however. But as a chaser to a hunk of uggy rich batter, it was all too much. Even for me.  The beer selection is quite interesting. There are about 50+ bottles on the menu and a good selection on tap. Unfortunately, the beers are on a chalk board menu and aging eyes make it difficult to read the beer list from most tables. One has to sort of belly up to a patron table to read the list. No one wants people hovering over your table while you're trying to enjoy a dinner and an intimate conversation.   Service is highly professional and knowledgeable. They've got a smart crew working there. A backyard patio and an outdoor BBQ offers expanded menu choices when the weather turns nice.  Like the Queen & Beaver, this is a great high place where you can kill two birds with one stone. As a neighborhood pub where you can hoist a couple with friends, Allen's isn't very conducive to that."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from a friend about the burgers.   I came with my boyfriend, brother and sister-in-law.  We sat on the patio in the back, which was huge, decorate nicely with greenery, and even had a BBQ going, which looked and smelt delicious.  Even though there were plenty of things on the menu I'd like to try, I opted for the burger based on my friend's recommendation.  The burger was quite tasty.  Not the best I'd ever had, but good.  It was dressed well, but everything kept falling off!  lol  I ordered a side salad, but what came was a handful of \"spring mix\" that you buy at any grocery store.  I was really disappointed since I paid extra for the side \"salad\".  I had a few of my boyfriend's fries, which was way under-cooked.    While the patio was nice and the service was decent, it's unlikely that I would come back here because the food is widely overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"With Allen's you actually get two pubs in one.  Allen's the main pub and restaurant, and Dora Keogh (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/dora-keogh-irish-pub-toronto), an über-traditional Irish pub that is so traditional, you can use words like \"über\" to describe it and it won't even flinch.  Both have their trappings and their purpose, but Allen's is definitely the place between the two where you venture in for a meal.  A mainstay on the Danforth, Allen's is always shoulder-to-shoulder and busy due to its location, it's backyard-enclosed patio, and not least of which, its food.  With lunch and dinners both fresh and delicious, you get to see why the place is packed.  Friday and Saturday nights are by far the busiest, so be fairly warned.  The beer list is substantial, the menu is wide but not to the point of being overwhelming, and the flavours come from the use of fresh and, in some cases, exotic ingredients.  If ever you thought that British food is boring, think again."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and feeling of being in a live place - great patio, full place and the service was good.  I was just happy to find a place that had that organic feeling of people having a good time.  That's it - no magic, no Wizard of Oz or flying monkeys.  It just feels right, and no pressure.  Please visit the patio!  They have a great beer list and overall I was pretty thrilled with the experience.  If they had flying monkeys, it might have made it to 5 (actually, I didn't get a chance to try the food, so am holding out on giving it the full 5).  Fun!"}
{"text":"Heat ambience old world style in one of Torontos preeminent institutions. Burgers cooked to order, great brunch, steaks and probably the best selection of single malt scotch in Toronto. The patio was booked for private event but I heard it's great too.   The service was great , no attitude, very courteous and to the point.  I guess the people complaining about the Service must have skewed expectations.   I had the burger and my girlfriend the eggs florentine plus a mimosa , St. Paul beer , cappuccino and coffee. Had the burger medium , was pretty good. With Quebec goat cheese, also awesome ($2 extra).  For people complaining thing are falling off the burger - this is a high end establishment. You're not supposed to put the toppings inside the burger - but eat them with knife and fork (lettuce , pickle , tomatoes ). The burger ahold be by itself o the bun with the cheese and condiments and - voila , nothing falls off.  The egged florentine were also great , came with hash. The baked yam was a huge yam cut in four pieces and bake to perfection.  Awesome.   Was the burger pricey for $17?  Sure, but I've had more expensive ones in downtown that didn't taste as good. To each their own.  Overall the bill came to about $70 for a Sunday brunch for two (mimosa was $11). Pricey but good experience."}
{"text":"I can't tell if it's a pub attempting to be a restaurant or a restaurant disguised as a pub.  Either way it seemed wildly overpriced for what it was. I don't begrudge anyone for running a business, but the city has a wide selection of better steak places, burger places, seafood places...etc. Our dinner for two ran $150 with wine.  If the bill was half that I would've been happy with the value, but as it was it just seemed like mediocre food at double the price."}
{"text":"This is a review for their brunch service and beers.  I've managed to make it here 3 times for brunch and once for beers, and have yet to be disappointed once.    The ATMOSPHERE: Allen's is a homey place on the Danforth that seems to attract quite a regular (and slightly older) clientele.  It has a comfortable, welcoming vibe and a nice sunny patio.  The FOOD (brunch edition):  They have some of the best eggs benedict (and variants) that I've had in Toronto combined with a generous of serving of perfectly balanced Hollandaise sauce.   They get a bit creative with the sides working things like a sweet potato hash in instead of home fries (yum).   I will also compliment their French Toast which is just sinful.  The other thing I've noticed is that they usually have one or two quite excellent vegetarian options.  They also have more lunch-like items, such as sandwiches available as well.  The DRINKS: On the BEER side they have quite a selection...about 10-15 taps and quite a large bottle list.  Like any Irish Pub, you have your Guinness, but they manage to work some of the macro-micros onto the list, and occasionally even some real micros.  The bottle list includes a decent (and quite pricey selection of Belgians).  The thing to rave about, though, is their SCOTCH selection...it's quite the library of this potent potable.  They're pretty expensive, so I've been glad to not be tempted at the brunch hour.  The SERVICE is almost always quite friendly, prompt, and attentive.  I've never had the slightest complaint here.  It's that nice mix of friendly and just slightly formal that keeps it on point and comfortable.  OVERALL, Allen's is a very tasty place for a comfortable, relaxed brunch.  They prices are just a tad bit on the high side, which is the primary drawback."}
{"text":"Really lovely atmosphere, with its old New York vibe. Nice spacious patio that we sat on and the food was really yummy. I had the polenta fries with the house made curry mayo (yum!) and the chicken and waffles. They were perfect, not too greasy, portion size was right and the waffles had a pumpkin flavour that just worked. Really good."}
{"text":"Allen's has a beautiful patio located at the back of the restaurant which is spacious and covered by a mature tree.  This is my favourite part of the restaurant as it is the perfect place for a date or gathering of friends. There are also families that come together from the community to have a meal together and that tells me that this is a local gem.  They also have delicious burgers which are made in house and can be served rare or medium rare. They have a great selection of beers and wine which are reasonably priced. They also have many other entrees on the menu. I have yet to try them but looking at tables around us, the burger seemed very popular. Service is prompt and friendly. A great place to grab a pint and a burger!"}
{"text":"The first time the lady and I went here, back in 2004, I thought the burger was one of the best I had ever had.  Well, I've since had the best burgers that New York, Chicago and LA have to offer, and I can say that while the Allen's burger is tasty and well-textured, it's not exactly earth-shattering.    Also, \"We also serve what are widely considered to be Toronto's best burgers\" = most Canadian sentence ever written on a menu.    So...  + great beer list, including 10+ local Ontario craft brews in addition to the \"house\" brew (brewed by Amsterdam Brewing Company) + pretty good burger; if you've ever had DuMont Burger in Williamsburg... it's like that but not quite as good + classic Irish pub ambiance  - pricey - fries blow - service not great and server not very helpful - hard-to-read beer list - menu hasn't changed in 5 years and still doesn't list the burger... which is what they're famous for  In sum: if you're in the neighborhood and you don't mind overpaying for an overhyped burger and some decent suds, do it.  But if you're going to make a special trip, save yourself the heartache and buy a bus ticket to New York."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for years. This used to be a place that you could count on no matter what to get a great meal and even better drinks. Not any more. I can't put put my finger on it, I guess it's just not as good anymore, that simple. The service is still good, the food just isn't, fish and chips used to be out of this world, now just sub par. If you aren't here during the Steak Festival, don't order a steak, it's just plain and not very good. Came here for American Thanksgiving Dinner like I have a few years in a row and left completely disappointed with my kids and stopped for burger after.Portions are small drinks are on the weak side. It's a shame because I really want to love it here like I used to but I just don't."}
{"text":"At first entrance I didn't know if I felt old or young. By that I mean that the youngest people in there before I arrived had at least 20 years on me; so either I felt young surrounded by the old or I was now amongst the old. Having just turned 30 two weeks prior probably fueled that thinking a little too much. Even though the patrons saw a few more wars than I have, it by no means felt like an old folks home catching the early bird special. There was still an air of sophistication while walking through the plastic flickering candle-lit restaurant to our seats.  We were seated right away at a table for two and quite promptly our drink orders were taken. So fast actually that we didn't even have a chance to look at the really long, two sided wine list. The menu was interesting as it had a lot of information, a little too much information I think while ordering food. If sitting alone I suppose reading the story of the restaurant and a really long paragraph about the burger is a good way to pass time, when with people it can just be confusing as to where the list of food is. My partner went with the Ontario burger with cheddar cheese and fries (a la carte), and I went with the chef recommend of pork tenderloin and chipotle mashed.  When they brought the drinks I laughed to myself a little bit. We both ordered rum and coke and they came in little old-school diner juice glasses. Later when my partner ordered some water, it came in those same glasses. The plastic candle on the table was in an even smaller version of the juice glass. It actually felt weird drinking a rum and coke out of a narrow glass that feels like if you squeeze too hard it will shatter. But I digress, they are just glasses after all and they did hold our beverages the way they should.  Less than 15 minutes for the food to come out which I have been finding to be a rarity these days. My expectations were met on the first bite into a very tender and juicy piece of pork. While the chipotle mash was a little inconsistant in texture and parts were too creamy for my liking, it was very flavourful as well. My partners burger was also juicy, thick and tasty. The fries that came with her meal were actually quite good as well. Not quite as well done as liked when asking for well done fries, but they were fresh thick sliced potatoe and really good. I kind of like that they didn't undercut the taste of the fries with salt or spices, another rarity. With a touch of sea salt and pepper on the table that you grind yourself, this was an overall great main course.  The desserts were a little lacking, with most of the dessert menu being beverages and two of the five food related desserts were tarts of sorts. I went for a chocolate Guiness cake with sour cream icing. While the cake was a little dry and tasted too much of cocoa, it was still tasty and the icing evened out the cake quite nicely.  I would recommend Allen's if you enjoy wine or just want a quiet atmosphere that is a little more romantic in nature than just a group of friends. The music, as well as just the general chatter, was a very respectable level to not have to raise your voice or strain your ears to hear your companions. The service was also quick and excellent. I am giving them four stars based on the service and the main course as I don't think it is fair to dock a full star just because of a lack of real desserts. The price of most of the menu could have also struck it down a little, but there are enough choices that are in a more reasonable price range that it is most that big an issue for most. I say check this place out if you are looking for a nice, quiet evening."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch there with my best friend.  The place had its own charm.  My friend had the omelet special while I had fish and chips.  The fries was sweet potato fries.  It was great  The size was decent, lots of beer selections as well.  I guess being an Irish bar, that's a must right?"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's been around a long time, and all I can say is that I hope to God I age as well as this restaurant.  To keep a place as fresh and relevant and busy 30 years on as Allen's is the feat of a great restauranteur.  John Maxwell is the real deal.   The service is excellent: professional and friendly. The staff is consistently wonderful. The kitchen is extremely capable, the menu is varied and interesting, and the food is very well prepared. The decor is classic and comfortable; everything is clean and well maintained. In winter, it's cozy and comfortable inside. In summer the patio is unbeatable: that back-of-the-restaurant oasis under a canopy of trees that Toronto does so well, and Allen's does much better than most.    I make the pilgrimage whenever I'm in Toronto and always look forward to my next visit.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good! Overcooked. Service was inattentive.  This place used to be good a few years ago but seems to have gone downhill."}
{"text":"Allen's has potential but falls flat on its face. Sure, the staff are friendly, decor is nice, and the patio is amazing. But the food on the other hand leaves much to be desired.   I'm not saying it's bad. But the burgers are far from the best in the city, and many other entries  on the menu are average. The burgers are actually too tall and narrow. Resulting in a messy  hand and frustrating meal. Fries and other sides are extra, which pads the cost of your meal.  The desserts I tried were mediocre and not even worth the time.  In all, paying $20+ for a simple main should at least net you some flavour. Instead you get a mediocre, overpriced, let down."}
{"text":"15 bucks for a medium sized hamburger without any salad or fries? You have got to be kidding me. RIP OFF!  My wife and I will not return, unless we start wanting to waste our money!"}
{"text":"I just didn't like the food this time.  FOOD I had the open-faced oak-smoked irish salmon sandwich on soda bread with red onion and lemon.  The salmon was great but everything else was just bland. The bread didn't complement the bread at all.  I felt like a rye bread would have done the salmon justice.    The salad tasted good. I think though they could have added some more ingredients...walnuts would have gone well with it.  WAITRESS our waitress was attentive but I couldn't stand how she put each serviette down so slowly and then one utensil at a time for the 4 of us. It felt like we waited for ages for her to get all the utensils down.  I just thought it was annoying."}
{"text":"I suggest trying their burger, medium-rare with peameal bacon and swiss. Five star deliciousness and one of the best burgers in the city.  The back patio on a summer's night is amazing."}
{"text":"Ok I'm updating my review here because I came for the scotch this time, which is what they are really known for. It was very nice. I went with a scotch connoisseur friend of mine who was visiting from out of town and he ordered us a scotch (crap I dont remember the name) that he couldn't believe that they had on their menu. It wasn't outlandishly expensive ($25 or so for a glass). I'm no scotch expert, but this was fine scotch. My friend was sufficiently impressed. It was smooth and had some really nice subtle smokyness without being too sweet.  Go for the scotch not the beer. just don't expect much in the way of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cute pub right beside the Danforth Music Hall. Pretty busy on a Tuesday at 7PM. Sat at the bar and had a burger (which according to the menu is one of the best in Toronto) and was disappointed. It was FINE, but not great, and very expensive ($17 without any sides). My friend got fish and chips which he said were decent but also very expensive. Good selection of beer (about 10 beers on tap), and beer prices were a little more reasonable.  I'm sure I'll end up here again for a drink before a concert but won't bother eating."}
{"text":"Let me start this blurb off with a sweeping statement:  I don't like pubs.  Not only that, I don't get them, I don't get their names (What the hell is a Firkin?), I hate the stinking, dank carpet they al have, and for that matter I don't particularly love beer.     That said, I do love Allen's and for all intents and purposes it is a pub.  But Allen's is different.  The large saloon style bar and hardwood floor décor harkens back to early America; the décor is like a set from a John Wayne movie - even the aging host is perfectly cast.  There is more to Allen's than it's antiquated charm...their beautiful patio.  Walking through the restaurant to the patio is like stepping out of the Old West and arriving in Paris, in July.  The patio is beautifully treed, with giant Oaks that must be at least 10 years old.   Oh right and the menu is quite good, untraditional pub fare with the standards --  good fries, great looking blue cheese  burger and some other fried stuff.  There is also a barbecue menu on summer evenings, which my boyfriend and I like because it comes with a ready-made salad bar."}
{"text":"Allen's is a great little pub on the Danforth, close to Broadview. They've got an awesome patio, complete with trees to provide shady spots for my fellow pale-skinned patrons. The beer list is pretty extensive with both locals and imports. I've only eaten here once, but the burger I had (with goat cheese and mushrooms) was fantastic! I'd definitely return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"On Victoria Day I made a return visit to Allen's for my 1st time in several years.  I was one of a Group of 11 people and for only my 2nd time at the venue, I/we were seated on their renowned back patio.  I believe we were afforded this courtesy due to our group size, the fact that we were there for both drinks and food and because the patio was pretty barren due to our arrival time, which was around 5 pm.  We did have to wait inside for our table(s) to be prepared but our wait was less than 5 minutes.  The service was fairly friendly and prompt considering our group size; I ordered the buttermilk-fried chicken thigh fingers which came with balsamic greens.  Everything was quite flavourful.  At one of my 1st visits to Allen's several years ago we couldn't sit on the back patio as we were there for drinks only (it was an after dinner social Event therefore all of us had already eaten); we were informed that we could go next door to Dora Keogh for drinks and while there we were puzzled by the servers going back and forth between Dora and Allen's with orders.  We inquired and learned that the reason was that the 2 venues are under the same management/ownership.  At another visit years ago for another social Event, I/we were seated on the back patio for brunch.  I think everyone who attended - and we were a large group - agreed that the quality of the food was really great.  I've also had pizza there on 2 occasions; both times I quite enjoyed my meal.  So even though I don't visit there often, I can honestly state that Allen's meets with my approval.  Being in a convenient location (close to the subway) is another plus."}
{"text":"We had a beer there yesterday afternoon.  The back part was jammed ... it seems to be a popular spot for a late lunch. We looked at the menu and was surprised that were weren't more \"pubby\" foods.  We sat at the bar and yakked with Steve, the bartender.  They had a great beer selection and a massive scotch selection ... the most expensive scotch is locked away in a safe and is $1,000 a shot!  We liked it there and will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Allens for years and I still find it one of the best restaurants on the Danforth. I have read a few reviews before posting mine and I realized that the bad reviews are majority service related. I don't think any restaurant deserves 1 or 2 stars when the food is good. Unless you get punched in the face by your waiter. Allens has always had good food and their burger is one of the best in the city. Service could be a little better."}
{"text":"Went here hyped for the burger, but was let down, it had no flavor, like literally no salt in it, and its really thick, so pretty much just was like some shitty meatloaf"}
{"text":"When I die I hope to God they have a patio in heaven as spectacular as the one at Allens. I love my patios and nothing so far in the entire city compares. I only ever eat their hamburgers too. They're the best. The staff are always casual yet so professional. I should've put a one star so you wouldn't go and I can have the patio all to myself (speaking of which one photo of mine shows it empty, only because I was the first customer of the day). So don't go here k? It's all mine!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Allen's is one of our favourite haunts. The width of the restaurant looks like you'd be cramped sitting at the many tables inside but it's actually quite comfortable. You don't need to lean out of the way as people walk by while seated at your table. There are booths at the front of the restaurant.  If you go to Allen's you must try either the omelette or the burger. They are absolutely fabulous and while other items on the menu are good we always go back to one of those two. The omelette changes every day and is huge! (three eggs!). Their beer and wine list is EXTENSIVE and everything on their list always seems to be in stock.   The backyard patio is like stepping into another world. I large, old tree grows in the middle and provides plenty of shade in the early evening but the middle of the day and late afternoon is pretty hot back there since there never seems to be a breeze.   Service is mostly hit but can be some miss. Many of the servers have been at Allen's for a while and are quite pleasant. On occasion we've had a newbie who doesn't know the menu, is overwhelmed with their table assignment (Allen's seems to give their servers more tables than the average restaurant) or just has bad table side manner. However in all the times we've been there that has only been the case about  five per cent of the time."}
{"text":"Came back here on a Friday night on a spontaneous Friday night bar crawl. We were chatty and craving chicken wings.   Allen's A1 sauce chicken wings hit the spot. They are definitely on my top 3 list of favourite chicken wings in the city.  Randall is the best. He's easily been working there for 20 years (no offence!).   On a Friday night at around 8:30 p.m. the joint was BUSY. You could feel the urgency of the watiers. But it's still a great place to be regardless the night. I personally like it on a weekday rather than a weekend night.   But still, yum and yum. An old faithful."}
{"text":"Two words: STEAK FEST!!!  I couldn't go through Toronto without a visit to Allen's again.  But the Steak Festival that was going on was a perk.  The menu listed out a variety of meats, which farms they came from, what the cows were fed, etc.  I'm a huge supporter of local foods so this was a real treat.   I went with a local farm (Miller?) grass-fed only sirloin cooked rare.  All meats were aged a minimum of 30 days.  It was delish!  Topped off the meal with a scotch.  Their selection of scotches still blows me away.  Service was prompt and courteous.  The waiter new a lot about the steaks and scotches.  This place stays tops on my list."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and very good at what they deliver in the way of food. Probably my favorite place on the Danforth, there burger is probably the best in the city and a place I would trust the chef's enough to order it rare. Only complaint is both times I was there this summer the bees where swarming around me while i was eating."}
{"text":"\"Do you like working here?\" \"Not really\" \"Seriously?  You would never know.\" \"Then thanks, I'm doing my job well then.\"  Allens is not the kind of place where I can ask the waitress to join us when she's off work.  It is much classier.    The good: - Best back patio on the east side.  I will fight you to defend this title. - Best burger in Toronto, IMO.  They ground the meat onsite and will cook it to order.  It's a tall and stout burger, which is how burger patties should be formed. - GREAT brunch.  Kat F and I headed over here on Mother's Day at noonish, and I have to say that Allen's rivals the 'good brunch' places on Queen East (ed levesque, lady marmalade).  It was slightly non-traditional for me, with the homefries being a bacon and sweet potato hash and the toast being replaced with a fresh biscuit so of course I was apprehensive but everything was perfect.  The ceasars are reasonably priced and could hold their own in a 3 round bout with the burger for best item on the menu.  - Good beer list, there is always something I want on it.  The bad: - It's too expensive.  The burger is $10.25 (which is actually not listed on the menu) and it doesn't come with fries.  They are an extra $6 or something equally ludicrous.  When we ate here for brunch it was $50 with only one caesar.  The orange juice was over $5.  I've had dinner for 2 there with a couple beers and it been easily over $100. - I find the overly professional staff off-putting. I wish they were more friendly.  They all behave the same way though so it must be part of the gig.  Pro Tip: - Park at the Loblaws at Broadview and Danforth; it's also a public pay lot.  It's $3.00 flat rate on weekends and after 6.  I will definitely go to Allen's again.  I always have a good time and I generally need to eat that burger once a month."}
{"text":"Last night before a concert 4 of us went for dinner. 4 mains 2 cocktails 1 good bottle of wine that was $80- this is mentioned for context. I had the burger with cheddar and peameal bacon. Peameal was raw in the middle.  Allen's solution?  The manager has decided that we will remove the cost of the peameal from the bill. Mickey Mouse operation.   Btw burger was not worth the cost. Will obviously not return"}
{"text":"Because of their awesome back patio, I've always thought only of Allen's during the warmest seasons. Sipping a nice cold beer and snacking on those perfectly crispy sweet potato fries under the shade of that animated tree makes everything seem easy breezy.   On the night of my most recent visit though, the weather was the exact opposite of that. It was during a heavy snowfall and we had gone out to the nearby hills to take advantage of the winter wonderland. Coming through the doors of Allen's soaking wet with an arsenal of dripping sleds in tow, we were warmly welcomed to hang everything up on their trusty coat hooks and relax.  My capon wings were as meaty and saucy as ever. My friends' gourmet burgers were reportedly scrumptious. Although I suspect that one never really gets used to the fact that the burger doesn't come with fries at Allen's, no one really seemed to mind ordering them on the side. I didn't verify this for myself, but the sweet potato fries were said to be just \"okay\". I don't know if this was because of the very late hour or the fact that there was a lack of sunshine and warm wind on our faces, but we'll be back to test that theory once patio season comes around again."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, so I am surprised I had not reviewed Allen's before.  In warm weather the patio is gorgeous and when they grill on the patio it makes the experience that much better but it can get cramped and the chairs are tiny fold up style, not the most comfortable, but I guess that is their way of keeping patrons from staying too long.  Almost every time I go, I order the burger.  There are so few places that will serve you a rare to medium-rare burger, but Allen's can because they grind their own beef.  If you order your burgers well done then you might not appreciate what is special about these burgers.  My pet peeve is that the only mustard they offer is Dijon, and I am a fan of old fashioned yellow, so I either bring my own or go without.  The onion is cut thick but suits the burger and the pickle is quite sour, so have a nibble before putting it on your burger in case you don't like it.  On my last visit, I ordered fries, which cost extra, and they are not the best - very thick cut and not crispy enough, but my greater issue was that I had to ask for ketchup, and mid meal the waitress took it away to give to another table??!! The place was almost empty, being 10 pm on a Sunday night... Does that mean they only have ONE bottle of ketchup?  And it's ED Smith not Heinz?  I had to ask for the bottle of ketchup back - awkward!  I'm not a beer drinker but my friends and hubby tell me they have an impressive list of beers here.  The ketchup hoarding waitress was not the friendliest, but service was prompt.  If the weather ever gets warmer, we will be back for the patio."}
{"text":"I went with a fairly large group for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The wait staff looked genuinely put-off by our size, despite the several hundred dollars we would bring in during what seemed to be a slow period of the day. The service proved to be subpar. While not overtly horrible, they gave the general vibe that we were an inconvenience to them. That soured the experience.  Other than that, my burger was excellent. Far better than your average pub burger. A little pricey considering it didn't come with a side, but definitely not unreasonable considering the quality.   Overall, good food that was soured by off-putting service."}
{"text":"I will take shitty service here just to enjoy the beautiful back patio! It reminds me of a traditional Irish countryside pub. I was waiting for a leprechaun to pop out from behind one of the lovely giant oak trees.  Can't comment on the food because I didn't eat here, but they had a good selection of beer. Proper Irish staff fr the most part and no Chinese customers, always a good sign!"}
{"text":"awesome wings, fantastic beer selection and great burgers. Really top notch!!! Have tried some of the other dishes as well (Irish salmon and the Parmesan chicken...also had steaks there a few weeks back) that have been ok, but not good enough to return for.  I have not been lucky with the service when I have been there (3-4 times)... Slow, forgetting things, mistakes etc...Especially annoying to see people arriving after you being served well before you and having to ask for things repeatedly..."}
{"text":"The price to quality and quantity in here is a joke. 14.95 for a sad burger with no fries. It's almost an insult. Last time I eat here despite having come here since I was a child."}
{"text":"Glad that we ended up choosing Allens to have dinner and drinks, the place is very cozy staff are very friendly and they know the menu very well. Food is amazing I highly recommend the qinoua salad, the goat cheese and herbs dip and the mushroom quasadilla.  I definitely will go back to this place to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"It's a bit dicey but the patio out back is enormous. I would probably go again but just for the beer. It was a bit quiet on the Sunday evening that we went, but we were in the neighbourhood. It's an Irish pub, but I wouldn't say that it's genuinely Irish. Service was friendly and the beer selection was gigantic. Come here for a quick pint but I wouldn't linger for long. From the reviews below, this place appears to be a hit or miss. So come prepared to stay longer or leave sooner than expected."}
{"text":"The food quality here is three stars and I would give the staff three to three-and-a-half stars. What brings this down to two stars are the prices. The price you pay for the quality and portion size are not equal. The quality is slightly aboves omething like a Jack Astors but you're going to pay $5-10 more for a smaller portion.  I just wasn't impressed. Maybe I need a second visit seeing all of the four star reviews."}
{"text":"2.5 star??   Allen's maybe one of the place that I can walked in and walked out without anyone asking or even anyone even knowing??   Maybe it was a little dark since it was 10:15 pm..... but I thought that 's when people going out?? but I guess not on a weekday?   Patio is lovely!! The trees are huge... on a cool summer night, sitting at Allen's back patio is like at some friend's backyard. But if I am sitting in a friend's backyard, I would have helped myself to a drink from the fridge!   No one even asked if I want a drink? or if I need a drink? or I just don't want a drink! Or I just got really confused after checking out the huge beer menu on the chalkboard and I just don't know what to order?  I even tried jumping up and down, waving my arms over my head... but no one... no one even noticed me... Maybe these wait staffs were trained in one of the Chinese restaurants?!   Allen's Special Light Draft 1/2 pint ($4.30) was a nice and refreshing to make me less frustrated with my beer ordering experience......"}
{"text":"Great time eating lunch here. Karl our waiter was knowledgable about the beers and made a great manhattan. Im visiting her from the states and had a great time. Will definitely come back next time Im in Toronto."}
{"text":"Been to Allen's a thousand times back in the day. After tonight won't bother again. Perfectly fine waitress to begin. Then order two drinks, a Caesar and a Margarita. Margarita is literally terrible, ask for something else. Beer arrives.   Then order a burger, fries and calamari. Waitress forgets to put in the order for the calamari, mistake number one. Then burger arrives, supposed to be medium, and it's rare-very rare. Too rare. How hard is it to cook a burger properly in 2018? It's not even busy!  We order another burger and fries. Takes FOREVER. Waitress forgets to order fries. Ugh.   I give up.   Food runner comes to clear the table, i ask her to take the bill to the waitress, she actually refuses, saying she can't touch it. Huh? Oh my get me out of this place.   Won't return. I'll go to Sidebar next door which is ten or fifteen times better both food wise and service wise."}
{"text":"When it comes to Allen's, I'm pretty predictable.  Sit me down, pour me a beer, bring me a burger.  Called it, great night, done.    The beer list is great, the crowd is a generous age range of regulars and others, the servers know their stuff, and the food is stick-to-your-bones good.  I've sat with people who opted for the fish and chips, the salmon, and the curry (complete with chapati); all were good when I sneakily extended my fork across the table towards their plates for a sample.    But the burger, the burger, is what satisfies my occasional (fierce) craving for beef.  As per the menu: every week Allen's gets a whole Angus steer delivered, which they butcher in-house.  The burger patties are made from this, no fillers, no fancy-pants additions, no sides.  I once ordered the fries as an add-on and they weren't worth the precious stomach real estate.  Stick to the beer and burgers and it's a foolproof combo, folks.  Yelp note: Allen's has A/C in the summer (phew!), but if you can stand the heat, and can find the space...the back patio is a true gem and oasis."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have had a variety of experiences, ranging from good to great.  It's true, the burgers are among the city's finest, and on a cold, wet, November's eve the atmosphere is warm and inviting.    Tonight I sat at the bar with a friend and was well attended to.  Known for its beer and Scotch list, I wasn't expecting the best vodka Martini but was pleasantly surprised.  It was mixed with care, clearly by someone who values the effort put into shaking a cocktail.    After dinner I indulged in a glass of Scotch, because, well... one does. And one is usually very happy when the burn simmers in one's stomach. It makes for a good ending."}
{"text":"If you see a show at Danforth Music Hall (which is a highly underused venue in this city), it's almost a certainty that you'll end up going to Allen's for drinks next door after the show. A small group of us went to Allen's for aftershow drinks one night and the service was excellent.   We were monopolizing a huge table while we waited for the rest of our crew to arrive, and when they didn't materialize one of the servers asked us if we would mind moving to another area. Of course we didn't, so we moved over to the bar. The server exclaimed: \"Oh, I just plum love ya!\", which made me giggle, and then he bought us a round of drinks in thanks for complying with his request. What a sweetie! He chatted us up about all the shows he used to see at the Danforth 'back in the day' and about the fact that he loves Fleetwood Mac.   If you're at Allen's on a show night you're sure to bump elbows with some rockstars as it's usually where everyone ends up at the end of the night.  I have also heard lots of things about their legendary patio, which I admittedly haven't enjoyed yet, but it's on my list of patios to invade this summer!"}
{"text":"Allen's has been a regular of mine for years ... warm and cozy in the winter with delicious comfort food. In the summer, the huge patio under the trees is perfect.  My favourite item is the oak-smoked Irish salmon with creme fraiche and chives. Allen's predecessor was Joe Allen's on John Street, a hangout of mine in the 1980s. Similar ambiance. Still miss it."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with my latest stop to Allens.    Pro:  (immediately) seated on the (beautiful) patio (expected to have to wait as per usual)  Cons: $14 for a gourmet restaurant burger is understandable, but another $5 for fries??  Cold spring roll appetizer was $11 for 2 small-ish cold spring rolls with a few garnishes.  Really?  Would go back, but likely only for drinks on the patio.  Shame."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best patios in the city. Out back is a great patio with the feel of a true beer garden.  A large, spacey area so that even when it is super busy, it never feels crowded.  Big arching trees right in the middle of the patio that provide much needed shade on those hot summer afternoons when you are out enjoying good food and drink with friends. Not to mention that the service is great and the food is fantastic! Eating inside is a nice experience as well. A nice, cool environment in which you can unwind and savor a few hours. You can also grab a drink out front where they have a couple of tables out on the sidewalk.  But the patio is my favorite thing about this pub."}
{"text":"Took my parents and my daughter for brunch on the patio. They loved the ambiance (casual but classy), the food was very good (if a touch pricey), and the service was excellent. Our waitress knew the wines and beers, and offered some great recommendations - and our coffees were refilled regularly. I see some reviews faulting the service, perhaps during the busiest peaks there's a problem. We were in by 11 ( when it was just less than half-full ), gone before 12:30 ( it was starting to get packed by then )."}
{"text":"Everything here is made from scratch- I've been coming for their burger for years. Can't go wrong with that decision! Their a little on the pricey side especially for their side (ie mixed baby greens with nothing but dressing for $8). Yet I will continue to go back when I'm in the area for a hamburger!"}
{"text":"Lovely.. last minute meal of Salmon Burger with a replacement lettuce instead of bun.  Normally these can be dry but this one was moist and lovely and the waiter really helped with my voice of wine.  An Oaky Chardonnay"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and my comments are apply to all of my visits.  Pros: Good food - Burgers are tasty, brunch is very good, eggs benedict are delicious Extensive beer menu Great back patio  Cons: Service is consistently slow and inattentive. On my last visit, we sat in the back patio. We were ignored by the wait staff and eventually the manager took our orders after we had been sitting for 15 min (it was 2:30pm on a Monday -  not very crowded). Food was very slow to arrive and again, no wait staff to be found for more drinks. We wanted to spend money, but could not get anyone's attention. Our order was a burger, fries, wings and a salad and the meal took an hour and fifteen minutes. Prices are a bit steep for the quality of service ($19 for a burger and fries). Smoking is allowed on the back patio, so watch out if you get a table of smokers next to you.  Overall - Despite some good food, the service was so poor I don't think I will be back. There's too many options in the neighborhood."}
