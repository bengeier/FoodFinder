{"text":"Worst experience I've had in a long time.  We first asked if they had a drink menu, \"no\" yet all the people around us seemed to be drinking some fancy cider drink, No biggie. Asked what was on draft, \"I don't know\" ok awesome, can I just have a bud light, \"sure\". We ordered a $13 bison burger to split. It was supposed to come with grilled onions, aioli and cheese, I ordered it med rare. What came out was a happy meal sized over cooked patty on a super xxl bun with just cheese, nothing else.  I was so frustrated at this point, there is more to this story, but I looked at the burger and just told them to take it off the bill. I'm not usually one to complain but for $13 the size of the patty was the size of a toddlers palm, I'm still flabbergasted!!  I can look over bad service here and there because I understand being short staffed, but everything just sucked about our experience there."}
{"text":"Bar seemed nice enough when we sat down but ended up being pretty awful. We went for a Brown's game with not very high expectations and still were disappointed. Bad food, came out slow and over cooked. The server seemed extremely uninterested and rushed us through ordering with no explanation. The draft beer my friend wanted was out. The only thing saving this from a 1 star review was a fun crowd and I tasted someone's tater tot nachos which were admittedly pretty good."}
{"text":"The food and the drinks were pretty good. The TVs were awesome to watch the Cavs game!!  I was actually pleasantly surprised.  When I got to the bathroom my opinion quickly changed. For being female I was extremely disappointed in the restroom. The toilets were filthy and the garbage cans were over flowing w dirty tampons. This place would be the perfect spot if only there was more pride taken in the restrooms. My husband and I will come back for food but the bathrooms need help"}
{"text":"Brunch review - I hate giving bad reviews but this was just ok. Nothing to rave about. And maybe I'm an orange juice snob but ice in OJ - ugh. We got the frenchie toastie- not very toastie, and breakfast flatbread which wasn't bad.  Everything was just ok."}
{"text":"BC of some of the negative reviews here, my husband did not want to go here for food. I convinced him BC I love supporting new local business...I'm so glad we did! 1. It is so much nicer inside! 2. The pricing was not as bad a mentioned in other posts! There is only one item at $20...most items were  $8-12. 3. Service was great! Our waiter was very nice and checked on us a bunch! 4. The food was tasty! We got the bruschetta flat bread and fries. They both were great, exactly what were looking for!  4. Give it a try!!!  They could have more chicken items such as the go to buffalo sauce fried chicken sandwich or something!  P.S. If you love trying different pumpkin ales this time of year...they have the best selection! I believe they have new ones weekly or biweekly!"}
{"text":"Not ready for business just yet. No draft list, No bottle list. Menu is a wreck. Food prices are ridiculous. For example, the \"Stache\" burger is $18.95. They need a proper renovation to charge prices like that. It appears they spent all their money on televisions and self-flattering masonry. I didn't eat so I can't comment on the food quality but the decor and lax attitude of the bartender didn't inspire me to try any food or return. Honestly, it looks like they took Malloy's, hosed off the light beer and tried to cram Deagan's in there. Unless someone makes drastic changes, I'd be surprised if they make it into the new year. Good luck."}
{"text":"Needed to get takeout on a Saturday afternoon, so we decided to try this place since it's new-ish and we hadn't been there yet.  The building looks great, and you can tell it's really been spruced up a lot since it was Malloys.  The place was totally empty when we arrived (not surprising at 3pm), and the bartender was friendly and offered us drinks while we waited for the food.    We were intrigued by the tater tot nachos, so we got the appetizer sampler and a vegan flat-bread to go.  Everything was good enough, but not something I'll be craving to have again.   I realize that  most foods don't hold up well to sitting in a box for 30 minutes before eating them, so I did take that into consideration.  I think that both items were a good value for the price.   We got just 2-3 pieces of the pretzels and cheeseburger rolls in the sampler, but the portion of nachos was quite large so it made up for it.  The cheese dipping sauce was pretty bland, and kind of an unappetizing beige color.  I really enjoyed the fresh jalapenos on the tots.     Overall the food was decent and I would go back to give it a real try and experience the bar."}
{"text":"Our server didn't really seem knowledgeable about the menu -- beer or food. She seemed a little annoyed to be there in general. The food was ok but I felt extremely guilty eating it all -- hamburger egg rolls are just one example of the fare that wasn't overly greasy, yet was still artery-clogging. It tasted pretty good, but I wasn't wowed. They had some good drafts -- I had a 12 dogs of Xmas which I felt a little odd enjoying in October.   Kids were welcomed and bench seating was convenient. A side of Mac and cheese (which we ordered for their main courses) was huge and a great deal. They were very happy. All in all, a pretty okay experience but I wouldn't be super excited to return. Not too much stood out about this place, and it's a little confusing what they're trying to be. It's mainly a bar and doesn't have a ton of \"restaurant style seating\" but has a lot of food. I don't know."}
{"text":"Wow! What a beautiful remodel! With the previous establishment having been soooo disgusting, i know it took a lot of time and money to get the place so warm and inviting! They have some great craft beers, specialty cocktails, and an appetizing menu! My friend and I shared the 1/2lb. Stache Burger! It had about everything imaginable on it- well worth the cost! The staff uniforms and unique atmosphere really bring the speakeasy vibe! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and charming decor and they have golden tee how could you not want to go here I'm digging the speakeasy theme and unlike the others I though my food was really good flat pizzas are awesome also the thought they put into the specialty drinks is on point! Muddled bacon ... Even tho I am veggie now it still made me drool! Also the hours are not right on here so I would call in advance."}
{"text":"After two visits, I feel compelled to write a review for this newish Lakewood eatery and drinkery. I had dinner and brunch and both exceeded expectations.   For brunch I had breakfast tacos filled with chorizo, eggs, avocado, and salsa. Two HUGE tacos per order, fully stuffed with fillings. The tortillas were grilled which added a nice touch. On the side was sweet potato hash. Amazing. My dining partner had the breakfast flatbread which was covered in eggs, hash browns,  cheese, scallions, and siracha. The Stache bloody mary was topped with a beef slider. Seriously. We ended up with a box of food to go. Couldn't eat it all.  For dinner we had the Buckeye Sliders: thick beef patties covered in nutella, peanut butter, and fried banana. I had to try it because it sounded so ridiculous. Was really tasty, but very rich. The Tom Selleck Burger was also thick and juicy and included thick cut bacon.  The cocktail menu is pretty vast and includes modifications on classics. I had the Peach Jalapeno Martini, which was mostly sweet with just a hint of kick. The Old Fashioned was strong as it should be. Prices were reasonable, especially considering both quality and portion size.  The atmosphere is very cozy and inviting. The marble bar is beautiful and the couches by the electric fireplace make for an intimate gathering. And the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Not impressed what so ever. Concept seems cool except no one there seems to know what they are doing or what is going on. Definately not ready to be opened. Business seems shady. Not very different from the malloys. Just looks like they changed the decor and tried to make it into something new. They will never make it in Lakewood with all the bars in the area that actually have a nice happy hour with good prices. I'd b surprised if it lasted a year."}
{"text":"Nick, the GM was super friendly to us when we were here last week. He took time out of his evening to be a great host. We were all very happy with the speed and accuracy of our service, and will be back again for sure. Gourmet drinks, a food menu that I can't wait to try, and golden tee. Who doesn't love golden tee?!"}
{"text":"One of the cleanest, most astetically pleasing bars I've been to in Lakewood. Nick was our bartender and was very friendly and personable. Their sink menu was top notch and beer selection was awesome. My friend got ordered a Dark n' Stormy and (being a bartender myself that makes this drink very regularly) it was a very well crafted drink. Awesome!!!! Keep it up !!!"}
{"text":"They used to have a great cocktail menu, but I opened it up today and there was a short list glued over the original menu...also, the golden tee is no longer here, which my boyfriend enjoyed playing with his friends during football games (legacy game from Johnny Malloy's). Food menu is still intact (love the loaded tater nachos), but it seems like they are still trying to find their identity. For a \"prohibition-type\" bar, I would think they would focus more on their liquors and beer."}
{"text":"We live right up the street from The Stache! The service was Great. And the food was out this world! Great burgers!! I had The Frechie with sweet potatoe fries.. Oh my Gaaawd.. It was delicious!   The GM nick.. He was so nice and personable.. Great man.. He made sure we were having a great time and great service!   The atmosphere was waaaayyyy Better Than the previous owner.. We sat in the \"patio\" area... They had such comfy seating! I can't wait to go back with a bunch of my girlfriends!   These people did a great job with the space and picked a great staff to work with them!! I would def. give them a chance!!!   Oh and if you did drink  too much.. They have a A taxi service that will pick you up for free up to $25!"}
{"text":"They have a good beer selection but I got a Mac and cheese bowl. 1. They were \"out\" of chicken that was supposed to go on it and 2. When it got here, there were chunks of unmelted cheese on the top and it was not hot. I'm pretty disappointed. My salad tasted weird. But they have live music in Saturday's and the place was a little busy. Not the best for food though, should have eaten at home."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a new restaurant in the area, but unfortunately our experience was not positive. Poor service, the waitress stayed behind the bar the majority of our night, cold flatbreads (went home to heat it up & still was sub par), the French fries are frozen (menu indicated they were skin on so had hoped for fresh cut). So all in all unfortunately will not be back."}
