{"text":"I used to love this place when it was Big Daddys, it is still good but doesn't have the same feel. The person behind the counter is a little hard to understand his english is a bit broken. The food however is what I gave four stars. I support local business and will continue to eat here when ever the craving hits"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty much the same as Big Daddy's, the hot dog restaurant that used to be at this same location.  The new owners added some new items to the menu, including the Chicago Italian Beef Hero, and the Meatball & Cheese Hero.

The guys behind the counter offer friendly service, and they're a lot faster than Big Daddy.  Big Daddy was very friendly, but he enjoy talking to the customers while people were waiting for him to prepare their food. 

I ordered the Chicago Hero, and they asked me if I wanted sandwich \"wet\".  I was shocked, because it sounded a little vulgar.  The sandwich was good wet.

If you liked Big Daddy's, you'll probably like Heroes too."}
{"text":"Went back to try the Italian beef sandwich (I was on a hunt for a good french dip for weeks and couldn't find one! The hangover from the hard core craving made this sound like it would help do the trick, I guess in a way it did, but they are just a little too different.) and it was ok! I think the Italian sausage and homemade sauce is better! I didn't like the pickled veggies on the Italian beef, but that may be a personal preference thing... 

I took a star cause it seems like the owner is getting discouraged. There was a sign out front that said the place was for sale, so it adds up. He was very different from the first time we went in, he let me sit there and struggle with an unbelievable language barrier between his employee and I. I had a simple order and it took about ten minutes for us to figure each other out! It was so uncomfortable! 

I'm not so passionate about going back, but I may. I would like to think that I am trying to eat better though :)"}
