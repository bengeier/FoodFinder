{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such a mediocre rating! My flatbread (\"foraged mushroom\" and goat cheese) was excellent, they have a reasonable (all local) wine selection and the wait staff were phenomenal. (My server made suggestions and went out of her way to get chili flakes from the kitchen... More than I can ask for from many chains). Granted the pricing was slightly above average, but honestly at an airport location, that was to be expected.

If you're at Pearson Airport in the F gates... Eat here."}
{"text":"Go here now.
Sit at the bar.
Don't look at the menu.
Order the fish tacos.
Enough said, great quality, reasonable price, for an airport, one of the best I've had anywhere in NA."}
{"text":"Good food, but service was slow. Overall a big improvement from the previous Molson restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a sit down meal. Service was good, several tasty gluten friendly options."}
{"text":"Placed an order at 10:30 for a sandwich, got one glass of water and then nothing over an hour. No food, no waiter. Wound up going to Tim Hortons to actually get a meal. Would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"I feel badly for Lynn Crawford based on this execution of her concept.  My dad had chicken added to the beet salad.  It wasn't cooked through- not just pink, raw.  My nephew's burger was over cooked on one side, and raw on the other- not an appealing rare either.  It looked like the patty had been frozen.  My fish tacos had a nice slaw, but the fried fish was overdone and hard, served with cold fries.  How hard is it to serve hot fries?  Our mentions of the two most serious issues (burger and chicken) were met with a discount but no other sense of concern or apology."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent but the service was terrible. We had to go get our own menu and flag down our waitress to ask if there was table service to which she responded with a \"I was heading to you\""}
{"text":"Good fish tacos but I'd prefer grilled fish than deep fried. Not very quick service for an airport. Salad was bland. Very busy with very little competition in the terminal."}
{"text":"Blah.
Soggy fries. If you can't get the fries right Lynne, why would you ever be surprised the chicken tasted burnt
I know it's an airport but I also know that dead fries shoukd never go out and that correct cooking is not location sensitive.
Service was a 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Worst service. Here on Victoria Day 2016, very slow at the airport, restaurant is not busy, waited for a table while 4 employees just walked by and didn't acknowledge me and 2 other parties. Waited 10min for a beer.   Food was very good. Too bad about the service."}
{"text":"I actually like Lynn Crawford restaurants but she should pay closer attention to this restaurant because the service was non-existent. We were flying out at noon on the 13th and saw this place and decided to try it. First no one greeted us and we had to make our own way to he table despite here being lots of servers milling around and a waitress standing on the entrance booth. After seating ourselves and waiting 5 minutes someone came over and told us she would get a server. 10 minutes later and no server and we walked out still hungry and disappointed. On the way out we bumped into the front server and told her no one came and all she did was stare at us and then proceeded to clean out our table."}
{"text":"Significantly better than expected for airport food. Service friendly and attentive. Certainly a little more expensive than a typical ' burger bar', but much more tasty."}
{"text":"Nice place. Interesting food if you stay away from the traditional. Good spice levels. Loved the spicy sausage with olives flatbread. My server Gifty is fantastic. Recommended and will return. Could use an IPA on the beer list."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Had to wait almost 30 mins for a GREASY pameal sandwich that came with fries instead of the promised salad.  For just under $20, they should get the order correct and it should not have greasy dripping out of it when you try to bite in to it.  If this is Lynn Crawford, she should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Way over priced.  No apologies from server.  We sat down at 5 pm.  Our flight was boarding at 5:45.  I asked our server, Mukesh, if we'd have enough time to order food.  He said 'no problem.'  We ordered a hamburger, fries, and flat bread.  Flat bread arrived 25 minutes later and hamburger arrived at 5:37 pm.  We had to slam our food in a take out box and eat on the plane.  I'm very unhappy.  I'd suggest that you avoid this restaurant unless you want awful service, $21 hamburger, and over priced drinks.  This place stinks!"}
{"text":"Walk away from this place. Uninspired menu, so I opted for the pulled chicken BBQ Sandwich. It was drowned in BBQ sauce and fries were lukewarm. And BLECH! The worst dark and stormy I ever had. Hard to screw that up - lime, dark rum and ginger beer. Okay, not expecting it to be as good as mine, especially in absence of my secret ingredient, but what was that? I sent it back and got the NYC Bicycle - and awful mix of gin and grapefruit soda.

Server brought second round of fries. Lukewarm again. Told they were frying fresh batch, agreed to wait. All they did was re-fry old fries. Hot but darker and too crunchy. All three had no seasoning. Number one rule at fry station: add salt when food comes out of fryer. Number two: change fryer oil regularly.

Only saving grace were outstanding servers who tried their best to make it right. They offered free dessert, but told them I could not bear to eat anything else from them. They graciously offered a free bottle of water for the plane.

They servers cared, but managers did not. I heard server telling manager about issues but lazy incompetent manager did not bother to come and apologize. I tipped well since not servers' fault they work for the uncaring leaders.

The thing that really upsets me is the place is called \"Hearth by Lynn Crawford,\" apparently some chef with self-imposed celebrity. Lynn needs to visit. She should probably take the giant photo of herself down. I really don't care how much you think of yourself, Lynn, I just want better food and drink for $35."}
{"text":"I had the crusted pork chop. It was 24 dollars before taxes and with no sides. I felt that the flavors were very good but it was a bit expensive for what it is. In addition, there was no crust on my crusted pork chops. It looked like it was just grilled. It was a little bit tough too. So it was not perfectly cooked. I wanted to try it because of the hype that it was from the first female Iron Chef competitor in Canada. I am Not sure I will go back again."}
{"text":"So sorry to read about the bad experience of others but for us this restaurant was awesome! We were tired, frustrated, mad...our flights were a mess but this food was a relieved !!! The cheese and bacon hamburger was awesome! The Mac and cheese with lobster and shrimps my son drool over it!"}
{"text":"Awful experiences here.  Regrettably, the operator of this restaurant was essentially given the exclusive right to hot restaurant setting food in the terminal beyond the security checkpoint in Terminal 1.  For this reason I have dined here multiple times, due only to lack of choice.  The food is marginal airport food that seems to be \"sexed up\" by the Lynn Crawford concept.  The burger tried to be gourmet, but the mismanaged kitchen and lazy servers turn it into cold overdone blah that can only be rescued with ketchup (which you have to beg for).  The place is busy, due to the monopoly and the volume of travelers going through the terminal.  Tables are slow to be cleared so travelers end up waiting in line.  When you finally watch uncleared tables for a while, you might get seated.  Then it will take a while for your server to turn up and take your order.  Be prepared to get stink eye if you have any special requests.  Food takes forever to arrive.  Average 25-30 mins.  Wait time for a table 5-10 mins.  Wait time to be served 5 mins.  BUDGET FOR AT LEAST 1 FULL HOUR TO DINE HERE.  We had enough of that nonsense after so many bad experiences and left to avail ourselves of roast beef on a baguette at one of the take-away vendors who heat your sandwich on a press grill.  It was surprising good and served in minutes.  It was less than half the price of our burgers and I will never go back to the Hearth."}
{"text":"Um, service is marginal although everyone is constantly moving and being busy. One star rating because they do not serve alcohol until 11am Eastern time. What????"}
{"text":"As fans of Lynn Crawford, it was with great enthusiasm that we chose to dine at her Hearth restaurant while waiting for a flight at Pearson Airport. Unfortunately it proved to be a terrible and costly mistake. The $21.00 burger I ordered arrived in yesterday's bun and was burnt beyond recognition. I sent it back only to receive another one that was equally \"rendered\" to carbon. I can only compare the taste of the burger to what I imagine the burnt meat scraped off of a bbq grill tastes like. To add insult to injury, my girlfriends meal arrived a full 10 minutes after my homage to the disaster at Pompeii was served. 

For this reason Lynn, you've been Chopped..."}
{"text":"Arrived to spend some time at a bar that looked like it had a decent atmosphere after our flight was cancelled.  However my wife and I were overwhelmed by the number of fruit flies. It was bad just when we were having drinks. When the person next to use ordered some food, it became seriously disgusting. Can't comment on the food because we are going to move on to somewhere else."}
{"text":"Quick stop before departing. Menu options decent; though not a lot of GF options. Pricey for portion sizes.  We had a salad (1) with chicken breast, soup (1), fries (1). My boyfriend had a draft beer. This bill was $57 before tax and tip. Ridiculous; albeit true to form for airport dining.  Food was good but we didn't experience much to know for certain. Service was slow and sloppy.  Long waits, messy tables, missing cutlery, no salt & pepper on table, it took 15 minutes or more before our drinks were served and only because we followed up.  Other tables around us appeared to have similar service concerns and complaints.  Disappointing for the cost."}
{"text":"I've had two meals at Hearth now, and both were quite good. Of course, the Molson Pub was the best restaurant here previously, but still. Service is good and fast, you can easily have a meal in 30 min. On tap selection for beer is poor. I had the chicken BLT which was pretty good, served with some very tasty fries. The mushroom and onion flatbread I had today was 5 stars - great toppings, delicious pesto, and crunchy delicious crust. Portion sizes were perfect. Only complaint, it can be very loud."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Only problem was it took 30min to get to the table. If you are short of time and need a quick meal, skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"After waiting for nearly 45 minutes, my food arrived. The butternut squash, back bean and corn soup tasted like what I assume it was: mixture of left overs. 
Even worse were the fish tacos: Cold, wet and soggy tortillas, oil-soaked sponges of dough surrounding bits of fish, and the soggiest, most insipid fries you can imagine... Truly disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"Nice.  Very nice. Missed our flight to Chicago, so we had time to wander and chose this place for our dinner.  The Burger was better than expected, but the chicken was really exceptional.  I'm not gonna make a point of flying through Toronto to catch a meal but this one was truly enjoyable. No problems with service."}
{"text":"This is my second time passing through this terminal this time with children in tow. There was no hostess at the mantel so we sat ourselves as we could see the wait staff standing around. After sitting at the table for 10 minutes with two children (can't be missed or heard!) I stood up told them I sat myself and now needs to place an order. They looked around like who turn is it and then one staff member took order, another bought water and another bought food...needless to say they all disappeared after. The fist tacos came out hot, pizza hot, and pasta warm but the attitude and look of confusion on the wait staff faces was enough to just walk out! You serve I pay and it's over...why so much confusion!"}
{"text":"I think I paid like 13 dollars or something for an \"asparagus and sundried tomato frittata with herb spread\" which turned out to be kind of a sad omelette with a few chunks of cold asparagus and tomato sitting on top and some gross cream cheese stuff smeared overtop. Also some equally sad, probably well pre-frozen homefries similar to those served in my high school's cafeteria. Not good. I wish I had taken a picture. It was really quite crap. I honestly would have been better off getting one of those prepackaged wraps at Starbucks or a Tim Hortons bagel; at least they would come hot.

The server, though, was very nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant should be called The Worst.  Due to the limited food options in Pearson Terminal 1 I took the opportunity to try this restaurant but was completely disappointed.  The server seemed annoyed that he had to provide service to people and actually brought me a wrong order and insisted it was what I asked for.  Not until he went back to check did he realize another table of his had made the order.  When I did receive my fish tacos after a 30 minute wait they were extremely bland and consisted only of batter - you can see this in the photo."}
{"text":"The Hearth restaurant has a great look to it but it's greatest didn't exceed every far from that. I found the menu to be incredibly limiting - I wanted to order the Falafel Faro Salad but they were out of Falafel and didn't offer a substitute which I thought was a little odd. The salad sounded great so any kind of vegetable substitute would have been possible. So instead I order the plain, basic mushroom flatbread with onion and feta cheese. Fine, expensive and not filling as much as I thought it was going to be. The lady beside me order the fish tacos that she ended up sending back because they were completely covered in batter with very little fish to be seen. The service was fine, nothing exceptional. The prices are a little ridiculous but it is an airport restaurant which tend to be more expensive. You would just hope that a place that looks the way Hearth does and has a name like Lynn Crawford attached to it would actually be worth the prices they have on the menu. Honestly if you have the option or time to go somewhere else, take it."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Got a dirty look from hostess because I dared asked to be seated somewhere where I could watch a ballgame. Even the place was only half full. 

Ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries. Got cold fries and no condiments. When I asked ft ketchup and mustard I was told ... get this ... \"We don't have mustard\". 

Then when I got the ketchup ... I never saw the waitress again. Could've really used a refill of my drink but I guess now. 

Next time, I'll eat the overpriced pizza pizza in the terminal. This place is *that* bad."}
{"text":"Enjoy the food when I'm there but the service is pretty terrible. Just went there during a connection, sat at the bar for 15 minutes waiting for a bartender to get served. There were three bartenders/servers at the end of the bar talking to a customer and looking at his phone and laughing. For 15 minutes. After trying to get their attention, I bailed and am now sitting at Apropos, which I didn't really want but am forced to do because of time. Get your act together folks! Your service doesn't align with your great food."}
{"text":"The service is very slow. If you have a three hour delay it would be the place to eat   
Food was good and well presented"}
{"text":"Awful. Limited options in Terminal one and Hearth is the former Molson Pub - you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. 

Service is lacklustre and food is simply not good, even the eggs. I'm not sure what it will take to get this restaurant to fix things, but I won't be returning and I'm at the airport approximately once per week."}
{"text":"I go through Toronto airport frequently and this by far is the best food you'll find in an airport. Their steak frites are excellent and always satisfy. Be prepared to pay for it though as the prices are not cheap. 

Nov/16 - Updating my review as this restaurant is not as good as it was when it first opened. They have changed the steak dish and their fries and neither are as good as they previously were. Had to remove a star and knock them down to 3 instead of 4."}
{"text":"I have rate here a couple of times and the service is AWFUL
It took me 10 minutes to get waitress and then another 5 to get coffee then 20 minutes to get a bagel with lox- which wasn't very good
Eat here at your own risk and only if you have an hour and a half time before you flight"}
{"text":"Chicken was undercooked. Dishes are dirty - my glass has lipstick smudges. Menu has greasy smudges. Just completely turned off by the lack of attention and care in this establishment. It does not make for a very appetizing meal."}
{"text":"Cold food. Poorly presented. Breakfast should be hard to mess up. Standard airport fair. Not a credit to Lynn Crawford."}
{"text":"Pretty shittastic.

You're trapped past airport security, so your options are limited. Choose elsewhere. Food was overpriced (as may be expected) but bland. I ordered the fish tacos (Which I was assured by both the menu and the server were excellent.) which were just battered cod on a cheap tortilla.  The accompanying fries were unseasoned, limp, and underdone. After finally hailing the server, the fries were replaced with a warm batch that was just as flavorless but drenched in oil.

We sat for about 45 minutes watching the waitstaff ignore diners and waiting patrons alike; and by the end took some joy at diners walking away after waiting at an unattended hostess stand after waiting ~5 minutes.

Tim Horton's is just down the terminal. Go and get Tim Bits for a fraction of the price and triple the satisfaction."}
{"text":"Airport restaurants are so hit or miss, especially when you consider the volume of people coming in and out every day. My sisters and I had a great experience here today. We were seated right away, our drinks and food came quickly, everything tasted great and our waiter refilled our drinks several times and brought out bill right away when we asked for it.

We split the meatballs with sesame toast and it was the perfect size for three people to share before the main meal. The meatballs tasted moist and homemade. Two of us had the burger, which was juicy and had crisp lettuce and pickles on it. My other sister had the falafel salad and she housed it, saying it tasted fresh and continued our great food trend on this trip.

Just one more drop in the bucket for an airport restaurant with tons of reviews. In my opinion, it doesn't deserve such a low rating."}
{"text":"Wow. Good food at the airport, finally. I can say that this is one of the better places to eat when you are travelling from terminal 1. I had the pork chop and it was so tender it was pretty effortless to cut, even without using a steak knife. Portion size is pretty good but I would say the price is high, but it is to be expected for airport food. 
Staff are very accommodating and seems like they know their menu well (at least the one serving us) when the table beside asked for vegetarian options, he steered then away from the salads as the dressings contain Worcester sauce which was made from meat."}
{"text":"The chef's tasting menu salmon was delicious. Service was fine for me, but I can see why others reviewed negatively. Don't come here if you're pressed for time (I know it's at an airport and all, but they haven't mastered their operations yet). Allot about one hour for your dining experience, and you should be fine."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive. Lethal drinks. I had a \"Red Derby\" which is basically a Caesar made with horseradish vodka. It cost $15 but it's a double shot and now I'm kinda drunk. The peameal sandwich is amazing, but a little steep at $17.  Friendly staff. Wait time very reasonable."}
{"text":"Having tried \"The Hearth\" at various meal occasions in the US departures Terminal One at Pearson Airport; I wanted so much for it to succeed as it tried to be different from the rest of the airport eateries headlined by a celebrity chef. One Disappointment after another, today's visit was consistent with that trend!

Walking in at 7am, with a connecting flight stateside at an adjacent gate;  I was determined to give this restaurant another Try, despite my previous not-so-good visits, as i had an hour to kill and it was right next to where I need to board.  

The breakfast menu, although overpriced, was tempting with its Hearth french toast ($15) And, scrolling down in the sides section, for a tempting bagel & cream cheese ($6).  The french toast was so fancifully described that I soldiered on and went right in.

This is supposed to be an \" upscale \" experience to commensurate with the menu prices and \"ambiance\"; but the service was nothing short of a much slower greasy spoon.  

It took just over 40 minutes for my french toast to arrive.  It was a thick slice of dry brioche bread, a shaving layer of visible egg with a dollop of vanilla yogurt (it was described as mascarpone cheese but they probably ran. Out?), two small frozen individual blackberries; 1 small frozen strawberry cut in half and 6 Tiny little blueberries with a 1 0z ceramic cuppie of syrup for ($15)

A few minutes later, my bagel with cream cheese came in ($6).  It was an ordinary sesame bagel that was steamy mushy.  The top portion steamed microwave style light and untouched; the bottom part slightly beigey brown and mushy; what probably happened is they sped up the toaster grill to get it out faster since service was sooooooo slow.  The cream cheese was salty with a herb blend I didn't ask for, i expected just plain old cream cheese.

After this irritating experience, it was taking forever to get my bill or the wait staff's attention that was busy chit- chatting.  I would expect this at IHOP or Denny's but not at this celebrity Lynn whatever her name is, supposedly upscale restaurant.  Come to think of it, they need an IHOP at YYZ:  \"hello hello? Come on Pearson Airport, are
You listening?helllo?\"

and with that thought, and that slowness, waiting for the bill and thinking of IHOP or just a normal toasted Tim Hortons or Starbucks  bagel that I could have gotten a few doors down To my left,  I was startled all of a sudden!  

I kept hearing the last call for boarding at my nearby gate F82.  It's Time to go ummm No, it's time to Run! ...and never come back! #ripOff #neverAgain"}
{"text":"We had the unfortunate pleasure of basically having no other choice but to dine at The Hearth during our layover from Amsterdam to Milwaukee. Their drinks were nothing special, and their fries were basically shards of batter soaked in oil. Gross. I'd say we won't be back, but if we're flying to the US from Europe and our layover in Toronto... Then we won't have a choice. :/"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast which had some reasonable options. But honestly, what restaurant has raucous hard rock music on at 7am in the morning? All the screaming made me nauseous, avoid this place till they fix the ambience."}
{"text":"This is probable the worst breakfast restaurant.  Waited forever for my breakfast.  Came in cold.   Manager came and did not even apologize just walked away. Rude and unpleasant. .  I wish I could put 0 starts."}
{"text":"Pretty decent, for an airport restaurant.  I had fish tacos, filled with tons of slaw and large pieces of fish.  The fries were crispy and hot.  It was pretty slow service, but we didn't mind, as we had 3 hours until our flight.  And it was understandable, because the restaurant was packed!  I guess if you're short on time you could ask them if they would be able to accommodate.  My only complaint was that my beer was lukewarm, and I couldn't finish it.  But everything else was great!"}
{"text":"We will never go to this place again.  Horrible, slow, rude service.  We were in there just under an hour.  That is ridiculous for an airport restaurant.  The food was barely okay.  What they called peameal bacon, was just thin ham.  There was no peameal on the edges.  Neither my husband nor I finished our meals.  My husband thought the hollandaise sauce tasted funny.  An hour later he hearly threw up.  
Awful, awful, awful.  Never again. Stay away."}
{"text":"Flatbread dough was uncooked and chicken schnitzel lacked flavour. Expected more from a Chef Lynn Crawford restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beverage at the bar, and was amazed at all the people having the Butcher's Board (charcuterie). It seemed to be more food than I wanted, so I opted for the Buffalo Shrimp appetizer with Bleu Cheese aioli. I couldn't have picked better. I gobbled it up, and was seriously tempted to lick the plate.

5 stars for the appetizer, 0 stars for the fruit flies that seemed to be everywhere.

Still, I will do it again next time."}
{"text":"Coming off of a 17 hour international flight and anticipating a 3+ hour layover before connecting to the United States, I decided to sit down at the Hearth for an early breakfast and some coffee because it was one of the few dine-in eating options past US pre-clearance that I could sit at to pass the time. For an airport restaurant, the food and service was decent considering the high volume of people that come through daily. However, like most airport restaurants, the price of food was astronomically high. I ordered the farmer's breakfast, which includes 2 eggs, sausage or bacon, breakfast potatoes, and a cheddar biscuit ($16!)- which was pretty good. Overall, I would recommend the Hearth if you have money and time to spend before your next connecting flight."}
{"text":"I always stop here for a bite to eat when traveling through the Toronto Airport.  Great burgers and pizza with a nice beer selection.  They do get very busy so you need to have some time, but I'll f you do it is well worth the effort."}
{"text":"The place is nice and the fact that it's right after you come off the escalators, it tends to be packed. I've been there twice already once for breakfast and this time for lunch and I'm not eating there anymore.

Had a steak frites, fries were soggy and the steak tasted bland. I should've went to Wahlburger instead."}
{"text":"I was starving! I ordered the fish tacos and fries- there came 3 little fish tacos.. basically like 10 pieces of coleslaw each- drenched in sauce, also the fried fish, don't get me started there was basically no fish, it was hard for me to taste any of it- all batter. Horrible service- placed at a table for 2 with my daughter who needed her own seat- they made me move a table for her. DONT COME HERE. Waste of money and expensive for what it is"}
{"text":"When I saw Chef Lynn Crawfords name on this place (which has replaced the old Labatt bar - which was just terrible), I was super pumped, especially for breakfast! Grabbed a seat right away and perused the menu.

The menu read extremely impressive in my opinion. Traditional breakfast offerings with a fancy chef flair, but then again, how fancy can you be at breakfast in an airport. I had had my fill lately of eggs and eggs benny so when I saw stuffed french toast on the menu, I was all in.

As you can see by my picture, it looked ok but it's really nothing special for what you're paying for - in an airport. I was hungry so had ordered a side of bacon to go with this. That was even MORE sad looking, just some microwave or equally cheap bacon on a plate (at a premium charge).

The taste of the french toast was pretty good, worth the price of admission.... ahhhhh maybe? Is it one of the better offerings in terminal 1 now? I guess.

3 star, definitely a decent thing to try out, maybe lunch and dinner are better. Lesson learned, always. stick. with. eggs!

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"On the upside the decor is great, the service is adequate, and it's one of very limited options when you want real food at the airport when your flight is delayed and you can't make it home for dinner. Unfortunately, that's about where it ends.

I think that they should rebrand the fish tacos as \"fork-free fish and chips\", because there wasn't even a lime wedge or cilantro to give a Mexican flair. Instead,  the fried cod was sitting on a bed of creamy coleslaw, a top a flour tortilla, served with a side of tartar sauce.

One more thing to keep in mind for jet setters,this is a real sit down restaurant in the airport, with ' real restaurant' wait times. Unless you're picking up premade food at the takeout counter, expect to wait a little while for your food."}
{"text":"Coming off a turbulent flight & having a few hours of layover, I decided to eat here since the dining options are scarce past US customs. The place was busy & full. I was able to sit immediately. The restaurant is casual & somewhat contemporary. I knew what I wanted & was able to place my order immediately. The food didn't take long at all to come out despite the business. Would highly recommend the Fallafal Farro salad. I added chicken but it would be great without it as well. The portion was big, the salad itself was both crispy due to spinach and smooth due to the hummus and the cheese. Overall great food! Taking off one star due to the astronomical prices and poor service since the waiter never checked up on my table."}
{"text":"Place looked busy so we decided to try this place and see what's all the fuzz about. 
We got :
shrimp appetizer : good but the portion was not worth the price.
Peameal on a bun w fries: pretty much a glorified BLT. Just with Canadian back bacon. Fries was good but they give u like 10pcs. 
Fish tacos w salad: tacos were good, although the 3rd taco only came w 1 pcs of fish. Salad was hopeless. Bland and there wasn't enough dressing. 
I feel like this place had a potential to be really good but just didnt deliver. Totally over priced. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Service was unbelievably slow-40 minutes to get 2 pulled chicken sandwiches!  When they arrived it was a hamburger bun with 2 pickles and  tablespoon full of chicken.  For $17 they should be embarrassed to serve that.  The check was $47 for 2 \"sandwiches\" which took about 3 bites to eat and 2 ice teas.  Wow!  What a ripoff!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh falafel salad, excellent steak and perfect Jamaican Jerk sandwich - it was all very good - not sure why the poor reviews - it's really good!!"}
{"text":"As delicious as the food was, the service was absolutely ridiculous.  

Not going to lie - we chose this establishment because of it's connection to Chef Lyn Crawford.  We have always been big fans.  We were a little shocked by the prices, but knew that it would be good.

I do remember that the food was good, but can't remember what we actually ordered.  I was so completely blown away by how rude and absent the waiter was.  When he dropped off our dishes, he warned that my mother's choice was quite messy.  Personally, I would have brought my customers extra napkins if that were the case, but he didn't.  And half way through... guess what... needed napkins.  When we finally saw him again, we asked for some.  He hurried away and didn't come back.  I watched him walking around the restaurant, tending to other tables, and when we made eye contact from across the room, I saw him start to walk towards the napkins.... so I'm thinking he forgot about it until he looked at me again.

He dropped off the cheque when we were done, then left again.  We waiting an uncomfortable amount of time for him to bring the debit machine back.  When he did.... his attitude completely changed.  He was like a totally different person.  Friendly and funny.  Too late buddy.  Too late."}
{"text":"I got a falafel and spinach salad from here which wasn't bad. It only took about 7 minutes to make, which was nice. It was pretty hearty and had garbazno beans and quinoa and seeds in it. Definitely filling enough. It cost about $16 CAD I believe, which is expensive, but standard for an airport."}
{"text":"Good airport breakfast. Table or bar service. Easy location to F gates. Friendly service."}
{"text":"So disgusting! Fruit flies everywhere! The bartenders seem to hate each other. I had to watch one bartender lecture a server about moving tickets that were on drinks. \"I'll just wait until you come to the bar to pick up your drinks, and then make them since you can't figure this out\". So demeaning. 

Disgusting bar to sit at. I would never go back. The staff and the cleanliness is beyond repair. Go to another bar to pay your $12 for your drink. 

If there was a zero star option I would give them that."}
{"text":"Decent service, decent food. Loud but understandably so. Unforgivable is the taste of their coffee. Did not finish it. Maybe they should clean their coffee maker more frequently."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Was seated and waited for 15 minutes and nobody even came for a drink order.  It's an airport....time is critical!

Don't bother; or you'll end up like me with no time to eat anywhere.

{"text":"My husband and I spent a solid three hours in Terminal 1 of the Toronto Pearson airport a few weeks back. The most pleasant of these was at The Hearth, where we dropped in for our Sunday dinner. This was the only real sit-down restaurant we came across on the US side of the terminal, and we were grateful to have a place to relax and get a drink.

We weren't the only ones with this idea. The Hearth was quite busy, though not so busy that we couldn't sit right away, on the weird little patio-type space extending into the terminal. Service was on the slow side, which wasn't a problem for us, but is probably good to know. It was otherwise fine, though, friendly and attentive enough.

There was a full bar, and we settled in with a round of drinks. My husband got a draft of the Barking Squirrel, a lager from Ontario's own Hop City Brewing Co. I ordered the Red Derby, getting another last taste of Canada with The Hearth's Caesar, made with horseradish vodka and Caesar mix, finished with lime-beet salt and a little skewer of pickles and beet. This was pretty tasty for the first half, but all the vodka must've been at the bottom. I stopped drinking when there was more vodka than clamato.

I wasn't expecting much of the food--a 2.5-star rating is pretty bad, even considered on an airport restaurant curve--but I was pleased with my fish tacos, which might just be the thing to get at The Hearth. They weren't the best I've ever had or anything, but they were solid, with crispy Fogo Island cod, carrot and cabbage coleslaw, chipotle mayo, and lime. There were three of them, and they came with a choice of market greens or fries. I got the salad, which was fine. My husband had a Hearth flatbread for his dinner, topped with buffalo mozzarella, tomato, and basil. This was basically a shitty cheese pizza, which is probably the kind of thing that earned all these 1- and 2-star Yelp reviews.

The Hearth isn't really a 4-star joint in the outside world, but it's an airport restaurant where you can get draft beer and cocktails and decent fish tacos if nothing else. If I were stuck in this terminal again, I'd go back without hesitation, and would recommend it to any other travelers looking for a place to rest and eat."}
{"text":"Waited....and waited....and waited....fruit flies everywhere... Pass & go toTim Hortons instead."}
{"text":"Waiter assured me that my breakfast sandwich was on its way for 50 minutes. At minute 55, he apologized on behalf of the kitchen and have me a prepackaged sandwich and water for free. 

The gesture was nice, but even better would have been if he'd told me earlier that I should go somewhere else. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"I couldn't be more disappointed. Not only was the service unbearably slow and rude at times, but the breakfast portions were completely unacceptable. I ordered a bowl of porridge with fruit and when it arrived, there were two paper thin slices of apple. By the 4th time I asked for extra fruit, my oatmeal was already cold. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced and below average meal with slow service. I had the $25 fish and chips, which was a disaster. At first impression the single piece of fish was huge, dominating the plate. Turns out the reason is its massive doughy batter is literally as thick as a thumb on both sides of the fish. It's the worst fish and chips I've had in a long time, much less at a $25 price tag. Service was painfully slow for everything from taking my order to paying the bill. I won't be back. Avoid this if you can."}
{"text":"Slow service with quite possibly the smallest water glasses ever. Burger was $22 and over cooked."}
{"text":"Well that was unexpected. Very good airport food. And the service was also friendly and fast. How nice to have a great airport spot. Thanks Canada"}
{"text":"I feel like the front of house needs to be revamped so that folks don't need to wait for 15 mins just to be seated (despite there being lots of available tables) or wait 30 mins for a meal. It's too bad. I really love Lynn Crawford. She would have been so embarrassed by this service."}
{"text":"Ugh... Go to Tim hortons instead. I am a fan of Lynn Crawford but this place was awful. I got the eggs Benedict and the yolk was solid, the peameal bacon was thinly sliced giving it a \"lunch meat\" feeling. The cheese biscuit sounds like a good idea but it was too dry for the whole eggs Benedict thing. For the price, it's better just to go to Timmy's where it is like fast food but at least it is reliable and consistent."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever. Ordered chicken and took 40 minutes to get it (evidently they don't understand they are in an airport and I don't have 3 hours for dinner). Also ordered keith Alexander's IPA. This is nothing like an IPA, more like a Pilsner, absolutely no hops. Traded that for the darker microbrew and that tasted like water with food coloring.... For $10. With all the good microbrews and beer in the area and that's what they serve?  REALLY?  Nice atmosphere, but if you don't know how to run a restaurant or have a decent beer, please do us all a favor and Don't do it at all!"}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here as my flight was delayed.

I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the meatballs from the appetizer menu.  The server made sure that I can receive my order within 20 minutes.

The meatballs were phenomenal! There were four large meatballs with 4 pieces of small garlic bread. The meatballs were in this delicious tomato sauce, covered with ricotta cheese. The sauce was light but still a bit creamy because of the cheese. It was a wonderful blend. The meatballs themselves were one of the best meatballs I've had. They were cooked and seasoned really well which made them tender and tasty. I dipped the garlic bread into the sauce and put pieces of the meatball on top. It was great !"}
{"text":"Slow service. If you are tight on time don't do it. I waited almost 30mins and when it arrived it was tepid."}
{"text":"Anyone used to eating at airports will be familiar with the standard of food - usually poor fast food served by indifferent staff and eaten with a plastic fork - and all for just three times the cost of garbage elsewhere. Well, this is different - and thank God for that! The table was cramped but adequate, the fries were fresh and tasty, and the burger actually very good. This place is as good as any nice restaurant anywhere, no airport-grade food here! Cost is unfortunately high - but so are their competitors, who all serve terrible food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Decent enough place to grab a bite in the TO airport.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Had the farro salad which was ok.  It had falafel on the side which was a bit dry and floury.  Also a mediocre glass of Pinot noir, although it was quite a generous pour, I'll give them that..."}
{"text":"Since the Hearth was a restaurant inside the airport, we were assured that the service would be quick for those passengers needing a fast in-and-out experience.

I really loved the design and feel of the restaurant too.  There were some very Canadian elements to the restaurant. 

We ordered a few appetizers to share since the mains weren't too appealing for us.   Our food was really good!  Everything was nicely presented, colourful, and tasted good.

I liked the Buffalo Shrimp which came with a delicious blue cheese aioli.  I could have licked the plate actually.  The shrimp itself was good too.

The Old School Meatballs were covered abundantly with a roasted tomato sauce, ricotta, and served with sesame garlic bread.  The meatballs were chunky and large; just the way that meatballs should be served at a restaurant -- it's so much more satisfying this way.

The Hearth Flatbread looked great and was topped with spicy sausage, olives, ricotta, and arugula.  This was pretty good too.  I don't remember anything bad about it at all."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast before a flight.  Food was good and brought out pretty fast.  Staff kept asking how we were doing on time, so we were never worried about our flight.  Staff was excellent"}
{"text":"I ordered the following items from the counter since I didn't have much time:

* forage mushroom goat cheese with onion flatbread (~$19)
   This was such a Delish dish! It was made within 10 mins and I really enjoyed it.

*\"fresh\" mango juice ($5.99)
   This juice was not fresh. IT was good but from concentrate. When I asked the cashier if it was fresh she said yes. If I knew it was going to be so expensive for juice from concentrate, I wouldn't have bought it.

* 1Lt Fiji water ($6.29)
   Typical overpriced water in line with other stores.

4 stars for the pizza and I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"The pulled chicken sandwich is literally the best sandwich I've ever had. Service is quick. I travel for work every two weeks and stop in to eat at the Hearth every time. The food is really good! The BBQ pulled chicken sandwich is so good. The sauce is creamy and unlike anything I've had. The bun is soft and fresh. heard that the burger is also really tasty."}
{"text":"When I went to The Hearth a month ago, I turned to The Hearth since it seemed like the nicest place for breakfast there.

We ordered their breakfast item which consisted of eggs, sausage/ham/bacon, potatoes and a biscuit. Service was slow, and they got one of our orders wrong. Instead of sausage, we were given ham. Our waiter apologised and gave us the correct order without taking away our previous order so we gained an extra side per se. So I guess that is a bonus.

The customer not too far from us made a fuss about his food and created a small commotion which led the experience to be slightly upsetting seeing that our order was wrong as well. So I'm wondering how often does that happen. Servers were hard to flag down and communicate with. Our waiter alone was really busy as I see him running in and out of the place non-stop. At this point, I blame management for their poor scheduling.

The Hearth could definitely improve on the service. There were also some flies flying about while we were eating and that made our experience down as well. I really liked the texture of the potatoes and the biscuit that they had served with the breakfast item. Either than that, The Hearth was just alright.

It was my first time eating inside the Pearson airport, I usually avoid since I deem the food to be expensive and disappointing so I try to eat before I reach the airport. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case this time."}
{"text":"We had good service compared to other reviewers. Prompt and accommodating. Had the kitchen make some aioli for fries even though they only offer ketchup. 
Ordered the chicken BLT and broccoli side. Sadly the food came out cold but our server kindly took care of that and got them to make us another BLT. All was flavorful. 

Beware of the fruit flies circulating your plate and beer."}
{"text":"The menu here was design by Chef Lynn Crawford. 

Travelling quite a bit for work I make sure that if I have an afternoon flight from Terminal 1 to hit up this place for their bomb Peamel on a Bun.  This is located at he bottom of security and definitely has better food than most other food options at Pearson."}
{"text":"I would hate to travel with the majority of commenters on this page, because christ on a cheese cracker, are they picky.
For airport food, this is pretty good. For airport service, this is pretty good. For airport prices, this is pretty good.
Have I just had shitty travel experiences or something?"}
{"text":"Headed back home to Seattle from Toronto and had plenty of time before the flight boarded, decided to sit down and have a late lunch.   Typically airport food and service is pretty average so my expectations were low....

I ordered the Fish and Chips which are made with Pogo Island Cod.    The fish and tartar sauce were fantastic and the fries were hot and tasty as well.     There wasn't much left on my plate when i was done.

Service was a bit slow but not painful.  The iced tea was bottled which was my only disappointment but I was surprised that they had unsweetened ice tea at all as it seems to be unheard of in Canada.    

I would definitely dine here again if I found myself in Toronto."}
{"text":"If you are  concerned about price at the airport move along.  The pea meal on a bun here is the best I have ever had and I love peameal.  The perfect sandwich.  All the food that I saw go by looked great but with few trips through Toronto I can't imagine trying anything but the Peameal.  Soooooo good."}
{"text":"Ok for an airport restaurant but their food cost a lot! Their food and the cost doesn't match... on other hand staff are unprofessional with each other. Once, we were disturbed by a group of waitress standing beside our table, talking and laughing loud. We also witnessed some of them kissing each other... so i prefer not to go there but there is not many options in that terminal."}
{"text":"Tried something new and a classic. 

Buffalo shrimp, was interesting... the shrimp had the characteristic sauce and there were shredded carrots and shaved celery.  

Also had fish and chips... the fries not crispy but seasoned enough.  the cord was nice and crispy... but under seasoned.

Expected these execution to be done better at this price."}
{"text":"I had the meatballs and They were decent. The buffalo mozzarella flatbread was just ok. I have had frozen pizza that tasted better. The real reason this place gets 2 stars is bc the service is terrible. Slow, slow slow. The waiter didn't seem to care. It took forever for a refill and then for my check. I'm glad I had a long layover as I can imagine how people could miss their flights. Next time go to Wahlburgers. The food is ok but the service is way better."}
{"text":"After waiting 20mins in a line elsewhere for a cup of soup, because I currently can't chew, only to be told they actually don't have soup (even though it's in giant letters on their menu that they do) I had high hopes for The Hearth. I was seated at the bar where there were maybe 10 people and 3 bartenders. I ordered the Carmelized Onion soup and after waiting 30mins for it to arrive it looked delicious. The taste was very yummy and the buttery, garlicy, pieces of bread served with it were delicious once softened I'm the soup. What I didn't find appealing was the crazy amount of very large fruit flies swarming around! I was a bartender and I k ow that fruit flies haooen, but they shouldn't be I'm abundance nor the size that these were. The wait time and the flies were enough to cross The Hearth off my list of airport eating spots."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a new option at Pearson, especially after hearing that Lynn Crawford would be backing this healthier option. The service started 8min after being seated. I ordered the farm breakfast; scrambled eggs were no better than processed options nearby, the cheddar biscuit was hard as a rock and the potatoes were cold.  My tea never came. Perhaps they are still working out the kinks of opening recently but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Spendy, had the falafel salad with added chicken. The falafel was hands down the worse I've ever had. The chicken was very dry but was seasoned well.  The greens were good. No one water refills so bring your own."}
{"text":"Tolerable but slow.

As others have noted, service here is insanely slow.  Airport restaurants are, generally speaking, designed to be pretty quick affairs - after all, you might need to catch a flight.  Problem is, even when this place had virtually no patrons but myself, service was abysmal - I basically had to flag down a waitress numerous times for even basic requests.  

The food here is good, but nothing to call home about.  It's better than the fast food offered elsewhere in the airport, but not significantly so.  Frankly, I doubt I'd eat here again, if only because the service is so bad."}
{"text":"Great roasted beet salad with goat cheese and spiced walnut, flat bread buffala and tomatoes and chocolate mousse and caramel, very good and a nice surprise as an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been here at least 4 times in the last year and it will be the last time. I realize it's an airport and prices are higher. However, can 22 dollar burger at least be hot and the bun not cold and hard for that money. Hey Lynn do a mystery diner and watch it fail."}
{"text":"Not bad for an airport. The atmosphere and decor is very airy and open feeling. 

I went for breakfast. the staff seemed very unenthusiastic and the service was super slow. Thank goodness I was not in a hurry. The laminated menu was greasy and dirty. I ordered yogurt/fruit/granola and coffee. It must have taken close to 20 minutes for the food and it was not that busy. 

I thought the food was good. I was looking for something not too heavy. the coffee was also good. Price was typical of what I would expect in an airport (read: pretty pricy!) About $15 Canadian before tip. 

All in all: the ambiance was nice, the food was good but pricey, service was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Bar service was good and ambiance was modern and clean.  I enjoyed the Hearth Eggs Benedict very much.  The Hollandaise sauce was just great with proper taste and appeal.  The biscuit was thick and fresh.  The meats supplied as well were real and not some pressed substitute.  In all, I was quite happy."}
{"text":"Definitely below average for restaurants perhaps a bit above if you factor in that it's in an airport. Food was actually pretty good. I ordered the Nova Scotia Lox with dill cream cheese and it was pretty good. Unfortunately it ended there. The coffee came in a dirty cup and the service was atrocious. Was seated for almost ten minutes at the bar before anyone would even take my order. Most of the staff seemed inattentive and bored. Took multiple tries to get anything from the server and almost ten minutes for my bill. So much potential - sad to see it squandered by poor service."}
{"text":"Over priced and inconsistent. Person beside me ordered the same thing, the burger and a salad. My burger was OK. My salad did not even fill the tiny dish it was in, and had two tomatoes and one olive. Salad of the person beside was over flowing out of the bowl and full ingredients. Staff was short with customers and seemed offended when I ask for my bill."}
{"text":"Had some extra time to spare at Pearson so I popped by.  Food was alright, fairly decent for airport food.  The fries were chunky and huge, fish taco was topped with lots of slaws.  I know I ordered fish tacos and fries, but still felt it was a little too greasy."}
{"text":"As a frequent business traveller, I'd been to the Molson Pub a fair bit for both breakfast and dinner. The Hearth has replaced the pub and with respect to appearance and food, this new restaurant is far more upscale and delicious but the service is still disappointing. 

I waited far too long at the podium before someone even addressed me, had to ask for a menu, had to ask for water, had to wait a long time for the bill and worst of all, when I asked for cream for my tea the waitress took the pitcher of cream from the adjacent table where a patron had just eaten and left! The cream was an small, uncovered pitcher! Very gross!

The stars in this review are for the food that came out fast, perfect sunny side up eggs, crispy potatoes and perfectly grilled tomato. 

I would suggest Chef Lynn Crawford think twice about associating her name to this place until they retrain or rehire the staff!"}
{"text":"Three of us had the Farmers Breakfast. Two with bacon and one with sausage. The eggs were tepid and the sides were sparse.  Oh and the total which included coffee?  $70!!!

I would avoid this place at any cost. Plenty of other options past security that are better quality. 

Shame on Ms Crawford for attaching her name to this place."}
{"text":"Slow beyond words, and snotty when you dare ask about it. Waiter could not have been less interested.  Eat elsewhere at Pearson."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Decided to eat here with an hour and a half to kill before our flight. We waited 10 minutes to be seated. After not being greeted or acknowledged, we flagged down a waiter who told us to grab a seat anywhere because he didn't know where the hostess was. It took 20 minutes for the server to bring waters and 1 cocktail, and about another 25-30 minutes for food. The server disappeared without asking if we needed condiments, etc. The food was just ok. The fish tacos were tasty, but the fish was on the dry side. The flatbread looked like it came from the frozen pizza aisle. We had to track down the server to request our check so we could get to our gate on time for boarding."}
{"text":"I stopped by here because I had around 3hrs to kill before boarding my flight and this seemed to be the only decent looking restaurant right after we got past security and immigration.

I was here mid afternoon and it wasn't very crowded and was able to get a table by the window. We told the staff that we would stay here for a while and to attend us slowly which they did gladly and didn't bother us unless we asked them for something.

We ordered fish tacos and later a mushroom flatbread both of which were good. It can get crowded and noisy, but hey its the airport and that's the best you can get, can't complain about it; just don't plan on attending a business meeting or phone call here."}
{"text":"This place is your typical airport restaurant: mediocre food with astronomical prices. 

I ordered the fish tacos with fries. The fries were piping hot and great but the tacos were ridiculous. The pieces of fish were incredibly small - smaller than my pinky finger and only 1/2 the length of the taco - and the pics I looked at online were certainly not representative of the dish that was put in front of me. 

Service was great but that's really all I could give stars for."}
{"text":"The Hearth is the only dine-in restaurant that serves edible decent food in YYZ (Toronto Pearson Airport) Terminal 1, after USA immigration, customs and USA airport security, Level 2 gates, near Gate F60.  Party of two waited five minutes for a table on a Monday high noon was extremely busy as nearly every table was occupied.  Airport restaurant dine-in seating is very typical with baggage and large bulky carry-on everywhere under the table including the side of the table.  Service is extremely turtle slow waiting for our food to arrive approximately 30 minutes as we rushed to pay the bill to catch our flight.  Utter dismay!!  After being seated we waited twelve (12) minutes to attain two measly glasses of water which is something very basic but essential as a restaurant.  Whoa, wait twelve (12) minutes for water?  We flagged our waiter loudly for our bill and waited fifteen minutes to find our female waiter, Susy who was turtle and snail slow schlepping her body to our table armed with a portable credit card machine dispensing a receipt.  Gratuity is automatically tacted onto your bill when paying by credit or debit card as: 15%, 18% or 20%.  There is no option for anything less than these three percentages.  Bad customer service!

The Hearth features Canadian Chef Lynn Crawford's concoctions using local Ontario farmers, growers ranchers and Canadian fisherman.
Lemon garlic shrimp penne CAN $23
I like the tomato sauce as it was not dry and the penne with Parmesan herb bread crumbs was a pleasure.  The spinach balanced the pasta intake.  It was edible to get the job done sustaining my appetite for the rest of the day as we landed in NYC at 10 pm (1000 hours).

Fish & Chips CAN $25
Large fried fish Fogo Island (near Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada) cod with one fresh lemon which the crust was greasy, crunchy and extreme heavy oil because it is beer battered.  The fish itself was very sleek and no bones.  The large steak fries was embedded too much potato.  Carrot and cabbage coleslaw and tartar sauce are included.  This entrée is dinner portion which held down as our flight was extremely delayed due to so-called \"maintenance issues.\"  

The food is the only aspect preventing me from a very low Yelp star rating.  Credit and debit cards accepted.  My party of two were low on Canadian currency as we were unsure if USD currency is accepted."}
{"text":"This was a great stop over in the airport but a bit overpriced. I went with the rest of the Yelpers and decided that the fish tacos were worth a try. They definitely don't disappoint--hot crispy battered fish with the perfect amount of fresh slaw and a quick squeeze of citrus can't go wrong. I had a cocktail, but wasn't impressed for the $14 price tag. I sat at the bar and the staff was attentive and kind. The food did take a short while to come out but I had plenty of time. If back in the airport, I'd stop for the tacos but stick to a water."}
{"text":"Very slow service make sure you have time. Food is good. Little high but the wait sucks."}
{"text":"Server was slow but you're at the airport food was decent ! But something happened after wth the server that was not very pleasant ...soooooo they only get 3 stars lol"}
{"text":"Needs a Restaurant Makeover. Sorry Lynn, I need to drop a star. Two rather \"firm\" scrambled eggs, and a hard-as-a-rock biscuit with good potatoes deep fried to death puts the Hearth squarely in the $8 breakfast special market. So for $16, the 2 plump sausages did not make up for a cheap, poorly executed dish. 

I know I can expect to get robbed price wise at the airport, but really..."}
{"text":"Drawn in by chef Lynn Crawfords name on the sign, plus the only available place with TVs to watch the baseball playoffs, I grabbed a table at the Toronto airport while I waited for my next flight. 
Above average pricey menu, even for an airport, but what was more surprising was the food. Hopefully chef Lynn wasn't working because the food was definitely sub par. Had a steak frites, which was medium well at best (had ordered medium rare) and the fries were overdone. Would have said something to the waitress, but finished my meal, and my drink, and watched some baseball before anybody came around to see if everything was ok. 
They are definitely fortunate to have a captive airport clientele because out on the street, this place would not survive. 
I would have been better off grabbing an overpriced Subway sandwich before clearing security."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food. French fries were delicious. However the chicken BLT might have been better without the chicken, which was overcooked and very dry. Otherwise the sandwich was good. Not cheap."}
{"text":"Worse service. The waitress looks at me, then keeps waking.

I'll spend my Twoonie somewhere else.

Based on other reviews, doesn't appear I was 
to get good food."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and drinks - particularly for an airport restaurant

We had an unfortunately long layover in the Toronto Airport and The Hearth was a welcome sight as we trudged out of security after clearing US customs - we had feared we were condemned to 'airport food'.

We had a trio of flatbreads - a lemon/shrimp, a sausage/ricotta and a mushroom/feta - all of which were wonderful. Be forewarned that the lemon shrimp 'flatbread' arrives deconstructed with the shrimp and tomatoes in the lemon/garlic sauce served in a separate dish to keep the bread from getting soggy. The french onion soup - served with the cheese/bread on the side - and mixed green salad were very tasty as well. And the milk chocolate pudding served in a large glass jar was surprisingly good.

Perhaps more importantly for an airport restaurant, their specialty cocktails were superb - we had the Freshly Peppered and the Dark & Stormy. The atmosphere is modern and bright and the service was reasonable - not great but not horrible."}
{"text":"This is a AIRPORT RESTAURANT people.  I see all these harsh reviews, NOT COOL.  This is a FIVE star airport restaurant.  They have really good food.  I ordered the Spicy Sausage and Mush flatbread.  Requested extra Arugula and wallah it was covered in glorious Arugula. My server, Julia, was absolutely lovely.  Very attentive, I never had to look for her, very knowledgeable of the menu, happy & upbeat, I would hire her in a second.  The restaurant itself was clean, laid out nicely has a very forward thinking motif. 

Eat here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Just awful. The waitress couldn't care less about my presence and barely acknowledged me. I had to catch her attention to order food and despite being in an AIRPORT, failed to warn me that the dish ordered involved lengthy preparation. After I ordered she promptly disappeared, never to be seen until I flagged down another server to tell them my flight was boarding and I had to leave. She then wandered around with my card for five minutes (hoping that the food would be made ready??). Regardless, she then lectured me about how long my meal took ( I should have known??) and generally was annoyed that I had to leave because my flight might leave without me. Forget this place. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast...it was right before my gate, so I popped in. I kept it very simple with a bagel, cream cheese and spread. The bagel was huge and toasted perfectly, and the spread was delicious. It was cream cheese, dill, garlic...it was very good. I asked for an egg for a little protein and made a breakfast sandwich. 

I was there at 1030am, during a shift change, but all of the servers worked together to make sure everyone's table was covered. My server was \"Kathrain\" and she was delightful...even after working the 3AM-11AM shift!!  

The couple beside me said that they have also had lunch and dinner here and really enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Ive walked by many times when i had a flight, but never had the chqnce till now to try it.

Disappointing on so many levels. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries. The service is slow, but that was because they were pretty busy. The food is OK if it was priced at half. The patty was overcooked and the server took 15 minutes to get me the cheque and water."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! I stopped by before my flight to the US, and waited about 10 min at the bar before being served. While their selection of food appeared appetizing I never got to try my food! After placing my order I waited about 25 min for it before I couldn't wait anymore and had to board. When I told the waitress I had to leave I wasn't even offered an apology!

The service here is disgraceful. Do not even attempt visiting unless you've got hours to waste before your flight!"}
{"text":"Burger is strong.  Fries good.  Beet salad excellent.  Out of falafel salad.   Overall very good"}
{"text":"Don't eat outside the security checkpoint! If you're going to the US, wait to get inside and go to Hearth. After the wretched experience with Swiss Chalet, we were finally able to check our ligand go through security. We wanted a glass of wine and found Hearth (skip the obnoxious Cibo-owned apropos; these are universally dreadful). We shared a delicious bottle of Ravenswood Zinfandel. When my husband mentioned that he was still hungry and had a nasty taste in his mouth from my, our server, Casey, recommended the hummus. That did the trick. Casey was charming and helpful. I only didn't give them 5 stars because there wasn't a gluten-free alternative to pita bread; some carrots and celery would have solved that."}
{"text":"Wow pretty decent food at the airport. I got their famer breakfast and a delicious maple butter is included. 

I will definitely come here every time I'm at the F gate."}
{"text":"We fully expected the food to be overpriced, but the Caesar salad was not well tossed and the chicken was dry. Surprised a chef would put their name on this place."}
{"text":"Despite Chef Lynn's name on the sign, one doesn't expect much from an airport diner. The expectation is decent basic food options, coffee, and quick service. Should be straightforward enough...

Somehow, even as measured by this very low bar of chain airport restaurants, Hearth misses by a mile. 

Having eaten here on several unfortunate occasions, I can safely say it has the worst service of any airport restaurant I have ever visited.

On a recent visit, literally every table in the (large) restaurant was stacked high with dirty dishes for the entire duration, despite being at only perhaps 1/5 of capacity.

Coffees took 15 minutes, and when the bacon and eggs finally arrived they were missing the bacon, and the eggs were scrambled instead of over easy as ordered. It's pretty hard to mess up bacon a D eggs, yet Chef Lynn's Hearth managed to. Chatting with other nearby traveller-diners, this seemed to be the case across the board. For one nearby couple, they managed to deliver the order of oatmeal to one of the two, however the breakfast for the second was still nowhere to be found 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"The Hearth restaurant is grossly over priced for the quantity and consistent quality of the food.  Service was excellent but a 15 dollar app consisting of two breaded pickles (one of which was burnt) and four tiny riblets was unappealing.  The bacon cheese burger was tasty but I didn't see any cheese - definitely not worth 20 dollars, but again this is an airport restaurant.  I would advise Chef Lynn Crawford to manage this establishment if she is going to put her name on it."}
{"text":"This used to be the Molson Bar. It was a drab design with pretty pathetic food. The ghosts still remain but this is a legitimate upgrade. I ordered the burger and while it was over 20 bucks it was actually really good. They replaced the lame big plastic menus with the bistro paper menus and significantly upgraded the menu. I'm still skeptical - but will definitely try again and potentially up the rating."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality, but sadly most airport restaurants with \"captive audiences\" cheap out like that. Worse here since only sit down (having wait staff) restaurant in the terminal.  I would still eat here if it wasn't for the staff though. They are very slow, very very rude, and do not listen to their customers. Basically here the customer is always wrong. Including about where you want to sit. (Needed to do some work, but refused to give me a table, in the half empty restaurant,to use my laptop). Do yourself a favor and eat before you get to the airport or hit the counter service joints."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the cold flour tortilla and the refried cod. The batter must be so clumpy and watery for it to flake out and fry like this. The fried batter was really thick in parts and held a lot of grease. Too bad. The fish itself was good. Salad was OK. Service hectic and therefore inefficient and slow. Need more staff during dinner rush."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast just before 5am before a flight. Full staff were not in yet so it got very busy quite quickly which resulted in slow service. Our actual server was quite nice but the others were not that helpful...likely because they were busy with their own sections.
I ordered the oatmeal but they did not have dairy free milk so I just had it with the brown sugar and fruit. It is actually cooked in water so it was fine....the small steamed milk is just a topping so I left it off.
The family had the farmers breakfast and an egg/bacon sandwich. They did not like the bacon and my son said the sandwich was just ok. I was still hungry after the oatmeal so I helped them eat their potatoes as they were all full after their meals.
It is on the pricey side and not a lot of gf vegan options....but oatmeal is usually a great bf item."}
{"text":"I found the chicken breast salad competitive to chicken breast salads in bistro, eateries or casual restaurants in downtown Toronto.  The breast was big in size.  It was thoroughly cooked, tender and not dry at all.  The services was courteous and experienced, but it could be faster.  The place was packed, so at least there was a reason somewhat.  The Hearth is located beyond the security point, so the audience is relatively captive.  I estimate that the prices are 30% to 40% higher than normal.  I am sure the lease payment and management fee Pearson charges has something to do with the high price.

Food and service only 3.5 stars.  If compared to the alternatives available inside the airport, 4 stars easy.  Just bad food at other places.  Also, I don't factor the price level in the rating.  It is located inside an airport after all."}
{"text":"I agree with the general review, mediocre airport fare, but pricier and with look to suggest better. We had falafel salad to start, salad was good but falafels tasted like they were made a couple of days ago. I had fish tacos, scant fish and taco tasted store-bought. Fries looked good but were soggy. My daughter got linguine with shrimp and that looked better. So-so for airport."}
{"text":"Really marginal food. Service was very good . Had fish tacos with salad. Both fish and salad were completely tasteless. Very disappointing.  It is the airport but the Lynn Crawford brand should delivrr much better. Hubbie thought burger was good."}
{"text":"A large modern restaurant with an bar and TV's to watch your games. On a slow Sunday morning I came in for breakfast before my flight. The staff was nice and I was served right away.

I had orange juice and The Hearth Benedict. I was told everything was is made fresh here and nothing out of a box, my meal was consistent with this so that's good. It wasn't the greatest eggs Benedict I've ever had but it wasn't bad. The bread under the eggs was a fresh piece of thick bread but I would have preferred English muffins and the potato wedges were extremely soft.

As a whole it's a great place to have a meal in an airport where the food is fresh."}
{"text":"The service was very slow despite the fact that it was not busy. Forgot my toast and had to ask 3 times before I got it. The Cesar we ordered had salt only on the rim... gross. Our server was nice. But not a good experience."}
{"text":"Way way way over priced. We sat down looked and the menu and left. Food looked average. For a airport, I would only go if you are desperate.
Quick update. Went back for some strange reason (flight delayed) noticed the service is horrible. One person managing the majority of the restaurant. I think management needs to take a look at this."}
{"text":"At the airport wanted to grab breakfast so I chose a sit at the bar for a quick bite. What made my experience so AMAZING was Katie! She is honestly the best waitress I have ever had anywhere in my travels. She made a great recommendation for Breakfast- I had the Fried Egg & Peameal Bacon on a Bun. She was so attentive, was always checking on me. My drink was always full, I never had to ask for a refill. She was sweet and kind to me and everyone she served. She really deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"This is probably your best bet to get a sit down bite to eat at Pearson Airport. When we went, there were storms overhead, causing many delays. Thus, the restaurant's kitchen was backed up as everybody wanted to stop in for dinner at all once. Our server warned us right away of the delay, and quickly got us drinks to tide us over until our food came. We both had burgers, both quite good. Server was very friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Yikes... Hair in my food. Over priced hair isn't my what I ordered. Need to check my food before I eat it, I guess."}
{"text":"This rating is based on my menu choice. Read below.

Hearth is a really popular new American restaurant in Terminal F with standing room only so they're doing something right. But this was Day 2 of the new launch and I experienced some problems which Shelly, one of the managers, tried to handle. In the end I left a lot happier and hope to get a chance to check this place out again once it's \"matured\". My noted issues were inconsistent service (friendly and helpful front of house was let down by disorganized servers who were frazzled), and a slow kitchen with poor value entree menu items. In particular the recommended BBQ chicken w/citrus salad was CA$24 and a small thigh chicken piece and a garnish-sized sprig of salad. This was way below my expectations of this menu description. I needed bread or fries and some vegetables to make this an entree. But with a slow kitchen that wasn't going to happen before my flight gate closed. Despite trying to get Luis, my server, to come back to my table i had to wait. In the end i decided it was better to leave my food without eating. This is when I talked to the manager. 

Shelly explained the teething problems and how the staff needed to explain the chicken dish better. I think a full entree dish of Chicken with 2 sides as Shelly suggested would be CA$24+10 which isn't really acceptable price for airport food. I'd relook at that menu. Shelly was kind enough to realize this was my dinner before flying so she comp'ed me a sausage flatbread to go which was quick and filling and less $ than the chicken. I'd give the flatbread meal experience a 4-star rating. And +another point for a refreshing change from typical airport restaurant choices."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better options at Pearson if you're not in a lounge.

Service was good for breakfast this morning. I had a farmers breakfast with the potatoes swapped for tomatoes. I would say nothing remarkable about the meal except for the maple butter provided for the biscuit - that was yummy."}
{"text":"It is one of the better food places in this airport. While the food was good but not great, I would eat here again due to a lack of options. What was annoying was that I had to ask four different people until I finally got to pay. I think it is crucial at an airport, that when someone says they want to pay that you get them the check within five minutes. That actually is a long time. When I finally told my server that I have been waiting for a long time she asked when my plane boards as in trying to deflect from the issue. It is unimportant when my plane boards, I have plenty of things to do before I board. Mainly work, but hey maybe I'd like to go to the bathroom before my flight too, you telling me that 10 minutes 'til boarding is \"plenty of time\" really is kind of a dumb comment."}
{"text":"If I were Lynn Crawford, I would think twice about associating my name and brand with The Hearth.  I had lunch there today and am still shaking my head at the truly indifferent service.  The food was good but hardly great which I could perhaps accept since this is, after all, an airport restaurant (although I have had excellent meals at several airport restaurants).  The space, itself, is attractive and the endorsement by a well-known chef was enough to bring me and my son in for an early lunch.  Unfortunately, those are almost the only things going for The Hearth.

The entire experience went downhill from there.

There is no sign whatsoever advising patrons to seat themselves so people stand at the podium located at the entrance waiting to be seated at a near empty restaurant at around 1040AM today.  Staff walk past guests waiting at the podium, averting their gaze and hoping not to make any eye contact.

After standing for nearly 7 minutes, a server finally bellows from the back of the restaurant near the doors to the kitchen saying \"Sit anywhere you like\".

So my son and I take a seat and wait, and wait until another server finally decides to go to the podium to bring us two menus.  The menus were dropped at the table with nary a word and no opportunity for us to even order a drink.

After more waiting, the server finally arrives and welcomes us in a friendly enough tone, offering to take a drink order.  Worried that we would be late for our flight, we just placed our order then and there -- two steak frites, medium rare.

More waiting (poor for an airport restaurant with few customers -- what would happen during the lunch or evening rush?  Customers running to the gate?).

The steaks finally arrived 25 minutes after they were ordered and we took our first bites.  Neither of us were impressed with the best thing we could say \"not bad for an airport steak\".  The verdict on the meal is best explained by my son, a 19-year-old male college student, who left a quarter of his steak uneaten on his plate.  If you know college students, you'll know that they rarely, if ever, leave anything on their plates!  :)

We decided against ordering anything else because of the poor service and simply left right after asking for and paying our bill.

There were ample staff -- 5-6 servers that I counted -- none of them seemed to care nor show any initiative.  No smiles.  No menu explanations.  Zero personality and certainly not what I have experienced at Ruby Watchco.

The food was mediocre and if that is what Lynn Crawford wants to associate her name to in a high traffic area with large numbers of both foreign and domestic travellers, then she'd better hope things get better and fast."}
{"text":"This place was popping at 8am. The space was nice and bright, it was modern, looked clean, the tables were filled, I didn't need much more to convince me to grab some breakfast here. Well, that and because there weren't many other options for sit down dining at the airport. 

We selected the frittata and the eggs Benedict. Meh. Frittata I did not like at all. It was not visually appealing, there were asparagus chunks just poking out of it. Looked like green fingers. There was no flavor, very bland, just completely boring. 

The eggs Benedict wasn't entirely terrible, but the hollandaise was certainly not freshly made, tasted like it came from a packet. My egg was overcooked. The English muffin was fine, I was thankful they didn't f that up somehow. 

For the price they charge I was expecting an average breakfast, like a 3, at the very least. Next time I'll go to the bagel stand down the terminal."}
{"text":"Food options at Pearson are very limited if you want decent sit-down food. 

This place was ok for food quality. I had the \"Farmers Breakfast\". It consisted of 2 Eggs (over easy), home fries (deep fried), 2 slices of bacon & a biscuit. Came with maple butter, which was delicious. The food was pretty good. Real home fries would have been better in my mind but I guess you can't have everything. 

What stuck out for me & caused a loss of a star was the waitstaff. Her name was \"Jackie\" & not once did she smile during the entire breakfast. I know she CAN smile cause I saw her do it to a coworker. To the customers however...nothing! Her smiling would have made the meal that much more enjoyable. She chose instead to remain stone faced. Remember...all jobs are voluntary!"}
{"text":"Yuck! I'd rather pack food than eat here. I ordered fish tacos. DONT! they're 99% batter. No fish to be seen.  Super slow service. It's an airport. They need to get it together"}
{"text":"Ridiculously expensive.  Food soooo mediaocre - what was that fish? pollock or bollock? but the cocktails first class and service pucker.  And heck after the day we just had with travel more than A-OK, slightly sozzled with the Freshly Peppered Tequila cocktail and a glass of chardonnay, Its good because we still have three goddam hours to kill courtesy of Air Canuck.  Mayas well go and buy some ice wine for .martinis later when we get home"}
{"text":"It was okay. The place is pretty big. It is a Lynn Crawford airport restaurant. I ordered a peameal on a bun sandwich. Peameal reminds me of canadian ham. I guess that is where canadian ham originated? It wasn't too filling, but it wasn't that greasy. The fries were crispy. The service was friendly. Overall, I enjoyed my meal here as I was waiting for my flight."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch and was surprised to see the low ratings. They may have worked the kinks out; I had a salad that was beautifully dressed and super fresh, with a grilled chicken breast on top. And it wasn't just the usual slice and dump a handful of chicken chunks, it had a great pesto like herb rub on it and was grilled nicely. The server (Susy) was the right combination of friendly and efficient even though it was lunch rush. Good coffee too."}
{"text":"I had an excellent server this morning who kept my coffee and water constantly filled - attentive with a great attitude despite the early hour of the day - will definitely come here again on my next transborder flight!"}
{"text":"The long line-up led me to believe this dining establishment would be top notch. Instead, it was disappointing in every way. It took forever to get service, and there was little available in terms of gluten free options."}
{"text":"I eat here 4x a year and have never been disappointed. The burger is superb. I just hate that they pre-portion my ketchup and skimp on the fries. Way better than the Molson Bar that was previously in this space"}
{"text":"At first glance this place looks great, has an actual chef, crowded, nice looking menu and prices make you think it's going to be good. It's not that great. Food is pretty basic and not very flavorful or exciting. 
Alcohol selection was also not great. 
Decent."}
{"text":"Picked this place because it was the aesthetically the best looking restaurant in the US side of the terminal. 

The hostess was really awkward. I asked for a table for two and she said \"that's really great.\" Not sure that means but we got seated right away. 

Airport restaurant seating, like most other places, was awkward with bags everywhere. The place was very busy and most people seemed to be enjoying themselves with a round before flying. 

Got the shrimp starter and beet salad. Both seemed fresh and had good flavour. I would probably order the beet salad again. The salad was a dinner size portion. 

Overall, pleasantly surprised that it was decent but standards were low because it's in an airport terminal."}
{"text":"Extremly rude staff and dirty glasses - not a pleasant experience. Would recommend everybody to keep looking for other options at Toronto Airport."}
{"text":"A great sit down meal before our flight back to NY. 

Small tables, crowded because all tables were close together, and people's luggages didn't help matters. Very busy, high turnover of customers, and the wait for food can be significant, especially for a hot meal versus a salad. However, they were upfront and accurate about that before they even take your order so you can decide if you have enough time. She estimated 25-30 mins for the food, and this was around  2PM on a Tuesday. A bit of a wait, but we had the time and were hungry. 

Fish/Chips - Deep fried fish, flaky. But it was not cut into strips, but rather a huge piece, almost the size of a chicken breast. Awkward to eat, and forced to use your knife/fork. But as you cut into it, the breading/coating broke off, making it not as fun to eat. Didn't effect the taste though. 

Fish Tacos - Same fried fish, but this was cut into narrower strips that would fit inside a soft taco. Was a bit too large for the taco, and with each bite there was too much fish. I even saw other customers leaving some of their tacos half eaten. Loved the sauce, a little spicy and tangy. Helped cut through some of the richness of the fried fish. 

10 oz. Strip/fries - Still some pink the middle, and came with sauteed onions. 

-All the fries were thick, crispy without being too crunchy, and still some softness in the middle. 

Food quality and presentation are amazing: I saw other patron's meals since we are seated so closely, and burgers were hearty and thick, salads were colorful. 

Servers were nice, came by to ask how we liked our food a couple times, asked if we needed anything, and updated us on how much longer until the rest of the dishes came out.

Glad we decided to stop by here."}
{"text":"Oh my......menu looks good, LOVE the decor but have never seen so many fruit flies around a bar before.  It is horrible and it seems to look like they never clean under anything.....you can see all of the garbage/spillage under the coolers from the bar stools.

That being said, we chose not to eat here because if what's shown to the public is that dirty, I can only imagine what the back of house looks like.

On a different note?  Jodi was super nice!!"}
{"text":"Lynn Crawford should erase her name of this place. It's a disservice to her. 

But at the same time, this is the closest to decent food you'll get at Pearson - so relatively speaking this store is doing well. Place this in the city and it wouldn't be nearly as good. 

Overall experience - food severely burnt, service disorganized, order wrong....."}
{"text":"When this restaurant first opened it was fabulous. Now, a few years later, it has gone done hill. While the food sounds fantastic on the menu, it is actually quite tasteless and never seems freshly made. 
Now, I love Chef Lynn, she is amazing! But I don't think she would approve of the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen these days."}
{"text":"A 21.00 burger!  Was it worth it?  No way but I had time to kill and I was hungry.  The pizza place across from here wanted 16 bucks a slice so I went with the burger here instead.  

The burger was tasty and the small portion of fries were cold.  They really deserve less stars but the burger was tasty so I can't justify 2 stars.  

If you're thinking you'll have great food, don't bother.  The girl sitting next to me said the flatbread pizza wasn't good either.  She expected it to be flatter.  Hey, it is called flatbread for a reason!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for airport food.  Not cheap (it never is at Pearson) but the beer was cold, the bacon sandwich and fries were tasty and it came out quickly.  A nice start to our trip."}
{"text":"The only thing going for this place is the food, that is if the right food shows up to your table. She went on to tell me I ordered a meat and wheat dish although I'm allergic to wheat and I'm a vegetarian. Why would I order that. 
We sat ourselves, had to flag down a server. Had to ask for cutlery, ask for water, ask for our bill. Bill was not the right bill. Ask twice for a terminal to pay and no one cleared our plates or asked how our food was. Tables has dirty dishes beside us the whole time but it wasn't busy. I worked in hospitality for 10 years. This was terrible."}
{"text":"Even in the context of airport food, this place is pretty bad and probably best avoided. To be fair, I only experienced breakfast but that was quite enough for me.

I ordered their benedict which promised me \"poached eggs and peameal bacon served on a cheddar biscuit with homemade hollandaise\". Sounds delightful, no?

No. No, it was not delightful in any way. Let's break it down:

Poached eggs: served completely cooked, as in \"hard boiled yolks\". FAIL

Peameal bacon: code for \"deli ham\". FAIL

Cheddar biscuit: Tough and hard. FAIL

\"Homemade\" hollandaise: Oh Lord, this was the worst part. My hard boiled \"poached\" eggs were smothered with a thick, gloppy substance that honestly looked like cake frosting. I scraped that crap off with a quickness because it was certain \"tummyache on a plane\" action. 

For $18, I don't expect every element of a simple benedict to suck. There you have it, folks."}
{"text":"Good airport restaurant.  Flatbreads (aka pizzas) are really nice with an interesting combination of ingredients.  Salads are nice as well, had the beet salad this time, with a breast if chicken on top.  Beer selection is the typical selection, but the addition of a microbrew or two on tap usually.  

A good choice to go to, especially considering there are almost no other choices in Terminal 1 US departures section."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for my overpriced shrimp linguine. Staff was unapologetic. Good thing I had time to kill otherwise I would have walked away."}
{"text":"The hostess wasn't so friendly; she had a straight face on, didn't even care to say hello. Our waitress was a little better, but we kept on having to ask for water and coke refills.. 

Food, on the other hand, was good. We had the Canadian Burger (it was on the chef's taste menu) and the fish tacos. The Canadian bacon on the burger is basically like smoked ham, and it was tasty. And the fish taco-the coleslaw on it was really good, although I did add a touch of pepper for my taste. 

Overall, it was a nice meal at the airport!!"}
{"text":"The Hearth is Chef Lynn Crawford's brainchild located conveniently at Terminal 1 of Pearson Airport. 
Of all the restaurants at Pearson, this is probably your best bet for decent food, good view and relaxed ambience. If your layover is long, the restaurant is worth it. The restaurant serves canonical Italian food, without a lot of surprises. The wine selection is fair, but not extremely expansive. 

For appetizers, I ordered a dish of sizzling lemon garlic shrimp with hearth flatbread. The quality was decent, but portion was extremely meagre given that the bill came to almost $20 for just an appetizer. 

The servers were a little passive aggressive. I did not stay in the restaurant for more than an hour and even though it was half empty, I felt pressured to either order more or pay the cheque. 

All in all, a satisfactory meal given that all the restaurants in the airport are sub-par. However, if this was in downtown Toronto I would probably not return."}
{"text":"Got to agree with some of my fellow Yelpers here, the service here is pretty awful. I came before my 7:00am flight hoping to get a good breakfast before my flight. Since I gorged myself on peameal the previous day I decided on the Nova Scotia lox and bagel. What really got me wanting this was the dill cream cheese since I've never heard of any place offering that with lox and bagel before. I know that prices are inflated in airports but I figured I'd pay the $14 or $15 for something being done in an interesting and different way. 
Well wish i could tell you how that dill cream cheese tasted.... I can't because it never showed up on my plate. Here's what I did get- a ginormous half assed toasted bagel with enough lox and pickled onion for half of said bagel and bland cream cheese. When I asked my hardly existent server if this was the dill cream cheese stated on the menu she said no because they didn't have the dill cream cheese. I said that was probably something that should have been mentioned when I originally ordered instead of just giving me regular and hoping i wouldn't  notice. I got a lame partial apology to which I promptly paid my bill, grabbed my luggage and left. 
I'm not sure who Lynn Crawford is but her food is definitely not worth the price being charged."}
{"text":"Horrible. Slow service, inattentive staff, and terrible food. NYC bicycle (gin drink) was super bitter. Fish was greasy and chips were floppy. You'll probably eat here because it's the only sit down place in the terminal, but hopefully this review will have helped you mentally prepare for the worst airport food you've ever had."}
{"text":"The options for YYZ terminal 1 are not fabulous but this place will do. Prepare for a high end Red Robin experience, sort of a better beer pub with good service and a satisfactory choice of wines by the glass. I got the fish tacos and the breading is a bit thick. I would have preferred an option for just baked or broiled cod but it wasn't too bad and I'm. It regretting the decision an hour later. Choose the side mixed greens salad over fries, it's good. I got a 9oz Sauvignon Blanc that went very well with the meal so I was happy with the wine. Prices are consistently high in Toronto and the airport isn't going to buck that standard but at least Hearth seems no more expensive than you will find in town."}
{"text":"Decent food, but appalling service. I sat at the bar and the kitchen staff was arguing audibly, super inefficient, and several orders were extremely slow while one was taken but not placed. Open kitchens and bar seats are generally my favorite, but the experience of seeing the hostility between and ineptitude of the staff was a real turn-off.

Oh, and my bacon and egg salad to go was missing the bacon. Details, I guess. :("}
{"text":"Early Sunday and I find myself at the US bound gates and hungry.  My gate is right beside The Hearth and the convenience with minimal departure time, I figure a simple tea and salad can't be bad.  The place is big, open, clean with not dirty dishes in sight but plenty of service ... I count 8 at least.  I sat down at 10:30 and by 10:42 I had my salad done and quite a large size for typical airport food.  So how did it go?

For $15, the salad had plenty of interesting texture from crisp spinach, crunchy sunflower seeds, crumbly salty feta, pickled beets, and falafel.  It was lightly dressed thankfully and given a nice light citrus note.  It was quite larger ... larger than most Bay Street lunch take out salads and only a few bucks more.  So value wise ... it's not terrible.  Would I order this again? Possibly not... the falafel was cold and a little stale.  The flavour wasn't terrible but instead of crunchy crispy interior with a highly spiced nice interior ... doughy and soft.

The service is much better than others have reported.  I got my tea in 3 minutes and the gentleman working the area hustled.  Cleaning, taking orders quickly and bringing food within 15 minutes for all tables nearby.  He also was personable and didn't seem pained to be working on a Sunday.  He even cracked a few jokes and smiled.

I'd be willing try this place again .. perhaps a different item but it was quick, clean and fairly good value."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick meal before your flight. Concise menu, which is good to control the quality of food. I find this place little bit expensive. They do have good choice of beers and alcohol."}
{"text":"When it comes to airport food, it's usually a major disappointment. I usually avoid it at all costs, but was stuck at Pearson and needed some food.

I stumbled upon Hearth and sat down for a meal. I had an order of Hummus and some pasta with shrimp. The hummus was actually pretty good. Not the usual straight from the container airport hummus, but something that tasted like it was actually prepared from scratch. The shrimp and pasta wasn't very good, bland and oily.

The restaurant itself is a decent size with a nice layout. The service is also good as the food was out quickly and I ordered within a few minutes of sitting down. 

Overall, this place isn't a destination to seek out, but if you must dine here, try the hummus."}
{"text":"Because of a flight delay I had a lot of time to kill last night so thought I'd splurge on a full dinner. As airport food goes this ranks way up there. Nice environment, big bar, lots of tables for singles with plenty of room for carryons.  It was all made better by a really friendly, fun, attentive server who talked me into making that drink a double and trying the carrot cake. The service was fast. My gin and tonic was delicious with no skimping on the gin. I ordered the fish and chips, which came out hot and fresh. It was good but the cod was a bit overcooked. Fries were great. Mason-jar carrot cake was really good with so much icing that I scraped some off."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to a restaurant by Lynn Crawford for a long time, but never had toe opportunity to go all the way to riverdale for it. When I saw her name on this restaurant at the airport, i was really excited about it, but i found it pretty disappointing overall.

To start, the service, like everyone else has commented, is really sporadic and really hard to get anyone's attention. I got their peameal sandwich with salad on the side, which was good but really sticky to eat. I literally had to run next door to the bathroom to wash my hands before i could pay. Let's just say that if someone asked me where i would go eat, i wouldn't want to buy a plane ticket just so i could go into pearson terminals in order to eat there - and there are places i would consider doing this for!"}
{"text":"Pleased to find a tasty and pleasant dinner spot during our long layover at YYZ. Our server, Sapna was friendly and efficient. Dinner was was good, and for an airport, not crazy expensive.  Comfortable and clean, we will return during our next trip."}
{"text":"We walked by this restaurant after going through security and the menu looked a lot better than your typical lackluster airport food options. We were seated right away, and I was impressed with the ambiance and decor inside. This place looks like a lot like other trendy, hipster brunch places--very cute for being inside an airport! Prices were a bit higher, but I wouldn't say it was outrageous for airport dining. It wasn't super busy, so service was prompt even though our food took longer to come out than we expected.

Food:
-Eggs Benedict: I took a bite of this dish off my husband's plate, and I've definitely had better. It wasn't inedible, but it just kind of fell flat. 
-Farmer's Breakfast: It's pretty hard to mess this one up since it's your standard fare of eggs, sausage links, potatoes, and a cheddar biscuit. My potatoes were a bit limp, and the biscuit was on the dry side. The maple butter was delish though!  

Overall, the food was just fine and it's not terrible for airport dining if you want something other than fast food."}
{"text":"After a second flight delay, I decided to get something to eat. The Hearth was busy and the menu looked good for an airport offering, if not a bit spendy, so I grabbed a seat. I gathered that this was a celebrity chef place, due to the shelves of cookbooks for sale with the same lady on the covers.

Service was slow. When my cab sav arrived, it was a beer and after letting the server know that, she disappeared for another long while, eventually returning with my wine order. I ordered the beet salad thinking that at 16.00 it would make a dent in my appetite, but it didn't. The one round disc of beet was 'glued' to the plate with a creamy cheese that was most likely goat. The disk was then cut pizza style into wedges and covered with a selection of stemmy greens. The greens were extremely lightly dressed and there you have it.

Since I still had a lot of time before my flight  that wouldn't land until into the morning, I decided I needed something substantial to get me by. I ordered a mushroom and onion flatbread that was still fairly small for 19.00 but looked good until I tried to eat it. All of the mushrooms are quartered and laying on the bread in all of their rustic glory, only to roll off with just the slightest tilt of the bread. Impossible to eat. Has this chef lady tried to eat any of her own food? I know, not a big deal, but I just finished attempting to pick up my beet wedges that were cheese-glued to my other plate.

Two stars only because the tables are so close, you can hear some good airport couple frustration arguments as you dine. Free entertainment is always a plus."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing visit to Hearth today. Ordered the Brick Chicken only to find it RAW, real raw. This after I had taken a few bites as it is covered in sauce. 
To make matters worse I had no time for anything else as had to catch a flight. No manager came to speak us, the apologies were left to the waitress. No food, no compensation, no official apology. Left only to hope my business trip is not marred with salmonella poisoning. 
Poor form all around and certainly very disappointing for a 'celebrity chef' restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food restaurants . I like the fact that it's away from everything ...  I felt like I was in a restaurant on Bay Street, Toronto.  We need more airport restaurant like this around the world  !  Bacon wasn't too greasy or fatty. Eggs were just perfect ! It really filled me up until mid afternoon. Don't forget to tip hardworking waitresses"}
{"text":"I left disappointed! 

The young lady working at the airport kiosks suggested this establishment, while I waited for my plane's departure home. So I took her suggestion, and figured it was a good place to eat going by the amount of people dining.  Unfortunately, my assumption was wrong.  

I started out with the hummus appetizer. It was garnished with some kalamata olives and feta cheese with some warm seasoned pita bread for dipping.  Honestly, this wasn't half bad.  Except the lack of pita bread they give compared to amount of hummus they serve. (So I ordered extra pita).  However, the pita took about 25 minutes. By that time, my not so thrilling entree was served.   

Now about my entree. I ordered the Buffalo mozzarella, tomato-basil pizza, aka \"Margarita pizza\"...what a disappointment!  The mozzarella was shredded mozz. It looked like the \"craft\" mozzarella I use at home, definitely not Buffalo mozzarella!  Also, the tomatoes that were used were sliced grape tomatoes. However, I would have excepted that, except there were only about 4 slices of tomato on my flatbread pizza. Lastly, the Basil...I thought that they slacked on the tomatoes?!?! Wow, there was only a few \"flakes\" of basil!  So I asked the server if he could send me over some more basil.  About 10 minutes later, I got a ramekin of mixed herbs!  Pinches of basil, dill and parsley!!!! WTH!  The menu never stated mixed herbs on my flatbread pizza, it stated basil!

So to conclude this rant of mine. I appologize if this seems like I'm complaining. But I have worked in the food industry for many years. So I know how hard it can be to make every patron happy, and I usually never complain. But every now and then I have to say something...and this time, I wasn't satisfied!"}
{"text":"Only reason this place gets three stars is the outstanding burger and chef; he's the only reason we got served. 
The service was in true airport fashion. We sat for 20 minutes in front of the pizza oven where the chef was preparing flat breads and waited for a menu and to be acknowledged. We were not in a big rush because we arrived to the airport extremely early and after arriving our flight was delayed. 
After waiting with no acknowledgement from the wait staff, my husband asked the chef for some menus. Poor guy was working extremely hard behind the counter and we felt badly interrupting but were tired of just sitting there. He went to our waitress & reprimanded her for neglecting us. He'd noticed when we arrived and was aggravated that we'd not been helped. He clearly takes pride in his restaurant and work. 
Our waitress came by and took our orders. We sat down in the middle of the lunch rush so it was busy but as we sat and waited another 30 minutes the place thinned out and our food never came. 

Apparently we aren't alone though as shown in other reviews.

It got to a point where we just really wanted to leave. It was taking too long for our food so we asked them again for it and they apologized and said the burgers take a very long time. The chef, again went and urged our waitress to hurry it up and then even went back into the kitchen. I genuinely believe our order was never put in until we followed up. 

We ultimately said, we have to be going so we can get back to our gate. we asked them to just make it to go because too much time had passed. They brought it out and repackaged it for us. I'm adding a star for that. 

Long and short, they apologized continuously at the end for the long delay and slow service. We appreciated that being acknowledged. 
The food itself when we received it was fantastic. I loved my salad & my husband enjoyed it too. We opted for that vs. a side of fries. Him liking a salad is news worthy. 

Our burgers were great. Hearty, thick, cooked perfectly and well seasoned. 

I guess I'd come back to eat here if in this terminal. I'd likely just get the food to go and eat on the plane. Not worth the aggravation & neglect if you get a table."}
{"text":"Had lunch here earlier today. A generous glass of wine and a flatbread pizza came to $31. Service was extremely friendly and made the visit very enjoyable. Food was fresh and delicious. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Was ahead of a white male waiting in line. Hostess named Ripple ignored us (Asian Canadians), served the white male first. Pretty disappointed that this happened in Canada."}
{"text":"The best choice for food when in this Terminal.  Don't bother with the other places - you will be disappointed.  At least this place makes an attempt to be creative for airport food. Bar stools are real uncomfortable - go sit at a table instead."}
{"text":"It took 31 minutes to get my fish and chips order.  I politely asked after 20 min and the waiter was nice but it still took a while after that.  Honestly this is really unacceptable for an airport restaurant.  At the 30 min mark, I asked again and the waiter said he'd talk to his manager and came back to me saying the food was being played.  When I was ready for the bill, the four tables next to each other literally passed the credit card machine from table to table.  I honestly don't think it was the waiters fault so I still gave a tip.  Looks like they are just severely under resources.  Management never came over to apologize and did not receive any discount.  The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is that the fish and chips were, in fact, really good.  This still does not justify the 31 min wait time."}
{"text":"I am forever spoiled after eating here.  I usually automatically lower my standards when it comes to airport food because well, why would you compare McDonalds to Del Friscos?  Both are meat, sure, and both are great at what they do, but they are definitely not in the same league and therefore, unable to compare the two.... Unless you are my mother in law, but I digress. 

Hearth was incredible.  The portions are huge and fresh.  And after a long flight from Europe, we were dying for something of quality.  

I got the BLT, and my husband got the pork chop.  Both were incredible.  We got the Mac and Cheese sans lobster to split , but that would certainly have sufficed as an entrée as well.  

Any other airport restaurant in major hubs such as JFK and LaGuardia don't even come remotely close to Hearth.  My only hope for my travel bug is that other airports will take note and follow suit."}
{"text":"I do it to myself every time. It's the only sit down service restaurant in F. The food is average airport food and the service is even worse. You will not see your server after your order is placed and don't even bother asking for a drink refill. And you will need one because the glasses are so small. Since the service is non existent, you can't get the check either. Which doesn't make sense since you are catering to people needing to catch a flight. For the price and aggravation, do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was recommended by the nice gentleman in the orange Info booth at the airport. Typical airport food, typical airport prices. 

We wanted somewhere where we could sit and enjoy several hours until our flight boarded. This place was good for that. Comfy chairs and friendly waitstaff. The menu was a bit small for me and the serving sizes small too. 

If you have the chance to eat before you get to the airport, please do so. You probably didn't like us and now have to choose between all the places behind the TSA checkpoints! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Thank you for finally providing travellers using this terminal access to good, clean food.

I had the chicory kale Caesar salad with chicken added. It was amazing. The chicken tastes delicious and unprocessed- just as if it was BBQ'd at home (except tastier). The dressing, pinenuts and croutons were perfect. Perfect portion size for lunch- I'm full. 

Perfect flavour balance in this meal.

A massive upgrade from the previous restaurant in this space (Molson pub)."}
{"text":"Its impossible to have such good food and service at an airport but here its possible. Had the eggs benedict and it was wonderful. Ham wasn't salty and egg was perfectly poached. Didnt feel greasy gross afterwards either. Best deal - the kids ate for free so our meal for 4 was 14£!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience for a 22$ vegetable cold salad!! I got my to-go salad 30 mins after ordering and  the service to expedite. 
I saw after I reminded, they started mixing the ingredients ( kitchen is open) And it was ready in 5 mins. I was not asked to sit and while I was carrying luggage ( as is expected on an international flight), it was a very small area to wait."}
{"text":"I saw chef Lynn Crawford's new restaurant at Terminal 1 (Pearson) and because I love her on TV, I wanted to try it out. I really wanted to like this place but I have mixed feelings. The atmosphere and service are excellent. The servers all seemed really active and enthusiastic...but then never refilled my glass of water the hour I was there. I ordered the salmon but they ran out (at 7pm) so I went for the Brick chicken. It looked ok and tastes ok but there's not enough sides to balance out the spiciness and thickness of the sauce on the chicken although the chicken was cooked well. The salad was also sad looking and again wish it were a larger portion because the chicken had a lot of flavour and there as nothing else besides the chicken and veggies. I then ordered the cheesecake in a pot and it was good but average."}
{"text":"Pretty good menu.  Service is not friendly. I guess nobody is at 5:30 am.
The food is excellent.  Price is out of this world."}
