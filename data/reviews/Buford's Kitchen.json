{"text":"Second time here for dinner, once more for happy hour.  Food is pretty good, portions are reasonable unless you're looking for gut buster meals.  Atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.  Although on a Monday night the hostess was no where to be found for a few minutes. 

I had previously had the fried oyster po' boy so this time we went with regular entrees.   Bourbon peach salmon was excellent as well as the  Mae Mae pasta with chicken.  My daughter had the BYO burger which was perfect. Finished with a strawberry shake that was great."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place where your waitress is visibly intoxicated, stumbling around, can't keep their eyes open, asks for your order multiple times 20 minutes after you gave it to them, then this is the place for you! Apparently broccoli cheddar soup is so uncommon that she couldn't remember it because it has a \"weird name\". My favorite part about the place, the Manager ran out on us in the middle of us explains the situation. Great place people, really classy joint! Next time, I'll keep up the road to Primantis."}
{"text":"It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's too safe, very average. The food is kinda bland and far from Cajun. Milkshake was the star of the meal."}
{"text":"Sad to see a staff take down a restaurant that does have good food. The menu is a mix of comfort food that is perfect for the location catering to pens fans and pgh downtown happy hour patrons. Unfortunately, the staff is extremely unprofessional and you feel like you are there to get yelled at or get a poorly drawn tattoo. 

Even the management seems like they have been plucked out of a bad 90's biker gang movie. From going there three different times with three different groups of people I can make the assessment from observation that the bartenders, waitstaff and manager are inarticulate, abrasive and reluctance to provide service.

The good reviews are most likely fake. Go to Easy Street in the oxford building for even better food and fabulous staff. If you are confined to close to that area pick Milano's for the pizza and subs, Red Ring or even Friday's."}
{"text":"Went to sideoo  prior to Bruno Mars concert. Service was slow (somewhat understandable given the crowd). Waitress wasn't very familiar with menu and didn't offer any suggestions. Ordered a 2nd beverage and never received it. Waitress came back and I reminded her and then beverage came 5 minutes later. And then 10 minutes later I see her walking around with the original order but never brought it to our table. Got the bill and was charged for 3 instead of 2. Bill was adjusted, paid by cash and was short changed by $6.  On the plus side the food was pretty good..."}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and don't think I'll ever return.  The service is slow, and half of the time the server returns with only half of what they were supposed to bring.  The food is mediocre at best - nothing was horrible, but for the price, it should have been wayyy better.  Also, a person in my party ordered a salad - and it was served with half-rotten cucumbers sitting right on top!  We saw it right away when they set it down - it was disgusting.  There is no way that the person making the salad could have missed it - they just didn't care and served it anyway!  It's convenient enough for events, but that's the only reason why people go there."}
{"text":"The fried green tomatoes were really good.  It's a great place to watch the Pen's game or to grab a drink afterwards."}
{"text":"Let you know that don't come in that restaurant because too slow to wait also not enough hot food service plus don't order catfish too bland no taste. I put 2 stars for on Valentine day. Thank you"}
{"text":"My wife and I along with another close couple had dinner last night, we were unsure whether to try it or not after all of the bashing on moon connect and facebook. But we did........ we were very very pleased with everything, our meals were excellent our server (Jennifer) was awesome. We will be back!!!!! Keep an open mind people, they are still new!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch as I heard they had awesome chicken tenders. The menu is varied and the bar appears well stocked. The bar has ice cold dispensers (the bottles are upside down into ice) for some shots. Ordered the Chick'n Fries from the Dis'n Dat part of the menu and holy moly - really great! The chicken is FRESH and not processed, never frozen! Really nicely fried. We split an order which had three pieces on top some fresh fries. If you bring in more people, you can receive more bang for your buck and get lots more chicken and fries. Highly recommend for some great food."}
{"text":"While the wait staff and food was fine, the experience at Buford's was terrible. Buford's broadcasts and hosts a nasty local radio show that ruined our entire experience. This show is blasted over the loud speaker and the host routinely berates callers and has a generally nasty tone. In the future, when I am in Pittsburgh I will be sure to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Traveling for business and this place was close. Good food and decent draft selection. Can't ask for anything else."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for breakfast once for dinner. Breakfast was fairly good, I had the Creole Benedict, which was pretty good they give u a nice big slice of ham on it, however I was looking for more of a Cajun flavor than it had. My girlfriend had the Bayou platter and let me say the banana walnut pancrepes were awesome!!  Was not a fan of the sausage links though. Now for dinner let me start off by saying it's more of a sandwich and appetizer place, considering they only have 3 or 4 entrees. I had the shrimp po boy and my girlfriend had the blt po boy and we both enjoyed them. I must say we loved and I do mean LOVED the loaded sweet potato fries! Both times being there it was very clean and service was decent. Will definitely keep it in our rotation when we go out to eat!"}
{"text":"One hour in, the first drink came...the first water.   30 minutes later...I don't know. Still nothing. It's an interesting business model to bring the check before you get the food, but if you want to get out of there in a reasonable amount of time, you'll want to get the check rolling pretty early.

Truly the worst service I've ever had. Hard pass."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few times and was rooting for it, but at the end of the day all I can say is its just overpriced lackluster food."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and the service mediocre. Two orders of kids Mac and cheese came out burned to a crisp and my dinner was cold. Overpriced and below par. Avoid."}
{"text":"I wouldn't mark this place as 'authentic', but it is what it is. Fried chicken, well fried anything for that matter, is good no matter what. I had the fried chicken sandwich without the bun and fried green tomatoes. Those were the best part of the meal. I hear that their milkshakes are good. I'll be ordering one of those next time"}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket sandwich with fried Mac and cheese. It was phenomenal, great service as well. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"A club of mine used this venue to host a Congressional candidate!  This was a lovely place to host an event as the private room was very nice and had a large television. Our waiter was very nice and very accommodating he even made funny jokes when reading off the drink selection. Other reviews say that this place is busy but that is only because it is close to PPG Paints Arena and is often frequented by hockey fans before the Penguins game. However, if you go when the Penguins are not playing the restaurant is nice and quiet. The pizza was lovely and they were very accommodating with microwaving it as we let it get cold (this was our fault as we waited for the candidate to leave before eating so the pizza was sitting out for about an hour). The restaurant was very generous with condiments as well. The only problem I had with the restaurant was that one sink was not working in the bathroom and I had to use another one. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hit this place for local atmosphere and a good time. It's just across the street from the Consol Energy Center stadium. Good atmosphere, good food and a great bartender named Jason. Street level and also terrace level for more fun, food and a Pittsburgh experience!"}
{"text":"First time at Buford's Kitchen and we all really liked it. Breakfast on a Sunday morning, so we had some time and wanted something good.
Waiter was fun and helpful with the menu. Went with his suggestions if the Creole Benedict and the étouffée Benedict. My daughter tried the Presley Pancrepes.
Everything was wonderful. The Presley had peanut butter and bananas riled in Pancrepes with bacon sprinkled on top. She loved it.
The Benedicts were just right. Flavorful hollandaise on the Creole Benedicts  and just enough spice in the etouffee.
A nice change for breakfast !"}
{"text":"Didn't like my experience here. It was short and painful. Visited in midSeptember wanted an Oktoberfest or a pumpkin beer and they had none. Sat a table, the bar was very empty (not a good sign) and not once did the wait staff come over to see if we needed anything. So we paid for our beers and left. Doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Visited Buford's tonight for the first time. Won't go back. It is February and we ate with our coats on because the restaurant was so cold. As we looked around the restaurant there were many people eating with their jackets on. We were sitting near the windows. We asked for a seat change and they moved us. Did not matter. Food was mediocre so that wouldn't make me want to go back and brace the cold. . Crazy. The manager came over to see how our meals were and I voiced my frustration with the temperature and she told me they were aware of the problem. They spent a lot of money fixing up the place from the ground round that it was prior, should have fixed the windows to stop the breeze blowing through the place.   My feet didn't get as cold as they were tonight sitting outside at a steeler game."}
{"text":"Awful service, awful food, awful place. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs. Seriously, do not come to this place. Our greeting by the server, after waiting 10 minutes was \"kitchen closes in 10 minutes\". Not hello, not sorry for waiting. Then when I asked for a milkshake the machine was \"shut down for the evening\". Never got the water we asked for, middle aged server avoided the table like the plague, and by the way, this was 930 on a Saturday night with the place half empty."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Moon Township! I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. The outside patio is so quaint and no doubt trendy. Just glancing up at it from the parking lot do you want to sit out there.. I am thinking that it's the string the lights and how it's decorated so lovely gives it the warm inviting-feeling. It was lunchtime.. but was craving breakfast so I ordered the po boy breakfast sandwich. it was scrambled eggs bacon cheddar cheese lettuce tomato on a hoagie roll..served with breakfast potatoes. The sandwich was good but just average. The potatoes are very good.. season just right with the right amount of zing. The service was good.. The prices are a tad more than what you would pay at an Applebee's or some other chain. The menu offers many different items and even a regular burger is $10 or more. I like the bar area..  red brick.. rustic decor. I definitely want to go back and check out happy hour.. and other food items."}
{"text":"Me & friends deciding to come here choosing over TGIFs pregame meal before Pens game. Great seating if your with a group of 4 or more. TVs are conveniently placed so you cant miss the big game,which  we watched a Steeler playoff game so you can the ambience!! Place was BUZZING! Now,about the food... I ordered the Build your own steak burger with fried egg on ciabatta. It was meaty,great angus flavor cooked perfectly medium. Delicious!! my only disappointment with this place they didn't have wings for an app,the fellas gotta have wings anywhere we go,lol! Overall, me & guys will return great place to enjoy the game!!"}
{"text":"I met my family here as I was visiting from San Diego. We sat outside and it was beautiful. I got the shrimp and grits and it was AMAZING. probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food is always great every time I visit. The service however not so much. On one occasion the restaurant was fairly empty. It still took forever for us to put in a drink order. When we finally got our drinks the server walked off before we can place our food order. After we got a chance to place our food it was a very long time before it came out. The order was incorrect but since we waited forever I didn't send it back.  On another occasion I inquired about rental the terrace for an event. The person at the desk didn't have a clue. I asked for a manager there wasn't one onsite so I left my information and never received a call. Again the food is good but the service can use work."}
{"text":"Do not go here!! Service would be better in a maximum security prison. Tried the bar, failed. One great bartender, little guy, awesome, the rest are completely ignorant and spend a lot of time avoiding patrons. Most of the waitresses and the female manager/bouncer look and act miserable. Big rush to get u in and out. Don't know what ownership took over since Blue Line closed, but this is the WORST bar in PGH."}
{"text":"My friend rehearsal dinner was at Buford's. When I walked it it was nothing like I was expecting, but I'm also not really sure what I was expecting. Very rustic feel with one side that was more of a bar area and another which was purely dining. We had the dining area to ourselves. 

We were offered a preselected limited food and drink menu for the group and the choices were awesome. I would have been happy with anything on the menu I think, and the beer/drink \"limited\" selection was hardly limiting. 

I got the steak salad with Pinot Noir. I was extremely happy with my meal. The steak was perfectly medium rare, just like I ordered and the greens and veggies were very fresh. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich and it was really great too. 

Staff was friendly and service was relatively fast considering our group size. I would definitely come back to check out the whole menu (or to get that steak salad again)."}
{"text":"Food Is good but if you are outsider u definitely know that. I get bad taste of waitresses."}
{"text":"We went there for a brunch. The breakfast we had was cooked very well plus good flavors.  No complants. The specials were great.  Wings were .50 nice size and the sauce was a perfect sweeter bbq. 
My grilled chicken po boy was really a nice taste and size (took half home..)Even the bread was better then I though it would be. Wish it was a little spicier. Service was very accommodating and keep up with our table very well. If I am in the area I will stop again."}
{"text":"This place should know that on a concert night that they will be busy. Literally waited 40 minutes for a drink. Absolutely ridiculous. Get some more workers that actually care about their clients."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We had Kyle as a server, he came over and checked how everything tasted, refilled drinks promptly, and even got our bill ready at the perfect time. There are many more items on the menu that I want to come back to try!!"}
{"text":"Recently a group of us gathered at this establishment. A friend ordered the catfish sandwich and I ordered the shrimp sandwich.  His catfish was excellent!  Cooked just right, very tasty it was a 10 as for my shrimp it was ok.  The service was great and very friendly, the menu is limited and different for the area but that's good.  The décor is industrial look very trendy for the area which is good since we in Pittsburgh are usually behind on trendy. Some people ordered crepes and loved them.  Great Green Fried tomatoes!  No not like Mom's but excellent in another way!    

.... stop by & see what you think..."}
{"text":"Good brisket and gumbo was nicely done.  Good waitress.  Not enormous portions but still fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"We went to Buford's before a Penguins game. We got a chicken salad sandwich and the chicken and fries. Both were reasonably priced and were large portions. There was a decent beer selection starting around $4.50. 

They have a pregame valet service, as well, for $28. Considering it's right across the street from the front entrance of the Penguins arena it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Our waiter acted like he was a McDonald's cashier taking our order. Also, we were 1 of 6 tables and it took 20 to see a waiter and 50 to get our food. The southern on let wasn't bad but my side of potatoes was super under cooked. When we mentioned this to our waiter he said, \"yeah, they always come out under cooked\". You think they'd fix that of its a reoccurring issue. 

The last time I was here it was the Blue Line Grille. I had such a great time then. Bufords is now a gorgeous restaurant with terrible service and awful food. 

Oh,  the stuff jalapeños are to die for though."}
{"text":"Well.... I was super excited for breakfast and it was so salty I didn't even try the potatoes cause they were drenched in grease. So disappointing. And the bartender never even asked if everything was ok. Certainly doesn't make me want to try anything else. If I wasn't so hungry I would've complained but whatever. Literally so salty and oily #disappointed"}
{"text":"Not a fan of brunch here, but I do love lunch/dinner here. Lots of options from seafood to southern comfort. I personally *loved* the chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries. Finally, they have a fantastic happy hour. Cheap food & drinks."}
{"text":"Best Burger I've Had In A While!  This was my second visit to Buford's kitchen.  The previous time was for lunch with a coworker while this time around it was for dinner with friends.  We were seated swiftly and greeted by our waiter right away.  The drink prices and happy hour specials were decent, not quite dive bar but also nothing that screams \"you're going to pay out your nose.\"

As I said to start this review, the burger I had was excellent.  Cooked just as I asked and all of the toppings that I ordered (each was +$1 to the base price) were plentiful and fresh.  I like these build your style burgers; sometimes I want bacon and eggs on it and others just a good old fashioned cheeseburger with ketchup and mayo will do.  So to have this option is quite convenient!

Overall the atmosphere was excellent, and service was good.  So we will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a drink!  Stopped here while killing time between a wedding & reception.  Fried green tomatoes are really flavorful and the margarita pizza is great as well! The bartender was really personable and fun!"}
{"text":"Came with a few folks before Tom Petty concert.  Terrible service.  Waitress disappeared.  $11.00 for 2 little chicken nuggets on a loaf of bread that they called a Po Boy

Then to add insult to injury, the waitress added some tip $ to what I wrote on the credit card slip!!!   which I didn't see until my credit card bill came"}
{"text":"Went to the Buford's on 5th across from the Consol Center on a Sunday at 2pm hoping for brunch food.  I was so happy to discover brunch is served ALL day!  My boyfriend ordered the pancrepes with fried chicken and I ordered the Southern omelette.  Both were so amazing!  We also ordered a Bloody Mary, which was just perfect for a hangover remedy.  Our service was great and the food was awesome.  Sundays are the perfect day to go.  We will be back, regularly."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for her birthday the end of August. We had a toddler, an infant & 2 adults. They had a toddler friendly menu & brought our food fast which is important when you have a two year old at the table. The menu had something for everyone, the portions were larger than I expected for the price and the food was delicious as well. The drink prices were a little higher than I'm used to but it all balanced out. The restaurant had been redecorated recently & was clean & felt spacious. My daughter & I agreed that we would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"I've only ever had drinks here before going to the Penguins games, but it's a classic bar atmosphere. It's always pretty busy, especially each time I'm there since it's right before the hockey games. 

Service is fine. Bartenders are always quick and nice. 

The food looks good, especially the nachos, but I've heard bad things about the food upstairs and some of these reviews are bad."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here before the Justin Bieber concert two weeks ago.  I sat at the bar with two others.  I ordered a Full Pint White Lightning that was on tap, only to be told that the keg was out and they were carrying Full Pint Festivus.  That is a seasonal winter beer, this is JULY.  It took one of the three bartenders 30 mins to realize we still hadn't ordered food.  Once we ordered, we sat there waiting long periods of time to get our drink refills.  I understand that it was a busy night but your customers are waiting for a drink and you are taking their empty glasses away without asking to refill them? Weird.  After we got our food, we weren't given any plates, napkins or silverware and had to flag a bartender down to get this.  Once we finished our food we had enough and asked to cash out.  I signed for a total of $62 on my check.  When checking my bank account the next week I saw that Bufords had taken 72$ out of my account.  Thus, someone added an extra 10$ to my bill - FRAUD!!!!! I called to complain and talk about this matter but no one would ever call me back.  Absolutely would never spend a dime in here again."}
{"text":"Let's start with the bad...  It was BUSY...!  BUT, that was completely understandable because we were there prior to a Penguins game who play directly across the street...  

The GOOD...  their food, their service, their prices...  

Got there about 6pm w Penguins tickets in hand.  Checked in at the hostess stand and gave them my cell number so they could text me when a table was ready (I like this- who wants to carry a funky transponder around w them) and we were told it would be 20 mins (pretty good since the place was packed).  We found a spot at the bar and ordered 2 beers.  By the time I paid for them I had a text saying the table was ready.  We were seated in the 'map' room towards the back that had walls covered w Pgh area maps.  We were immediately greeted by Mikey who introduced himself and made some menu recommendations.  Being that we were headed to the game we ordered simple things- Pulled Pork Nachos & Chicken and Fries. Our food arrived in about 10 minutes.  The nachos were stuffed in the middle with tons of pork & cheese, salsa & sour cream sprinkled around and BBQ sauce drizzled all over. They were delicious!  See my pic.  Next was the Chicken (tenders) and fries. The fries were only room temp because (as Mikey explained) they're cooked in 'batches' and we must have gotten them towards the old end.  He offered fresh, hot fries but we declined.  He brought them anyway, we LOVED THAT.  The tenders... OH THE TENDERS...!  These were full thick strips of breast meat fried perfectly.  They were the best chicken tenders either of us have ever had!  Mikey comped a draft beer for our 'fry issue' which was very fair.  The place started to clear out and Mikey stopped for a few mins to chat.  He was very friendly and really made us feel appreciated for stopping in.  We left with the promise to return, and we certainly will..."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service! We went for lunch and had a burger and salmon salad, which both were amazing. Compliments to the chef! Also our waitress, Debra, was the sweetest thing ever. She was helpful, knowledgeable and even recommended dipping sauces for our fries. Will definitely e back!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait for this place to open, but sadly I am very disappointed.

While the place looks really great since it was remodeled, the seats they chose for the bar are so tiny.  I would bet they are only 6\" on each side.  Plus there is no foot rest on the bar.

I ordered take out.  When I placed the order, the employee asked what I wanted as a side for each sandwich (shrimp po boy & chicken po boy).  So she gave me a list of several items.  One would think they were included in the price because she implied that.  But no....I get there and she charged me $2 for the fries & $2 for the slaw.  Told me only the potato chips were included.  So she took the fries & slaw back and gave me the chips.  You would think she would just void out the $4.  Normally I would have just paid, but it just really ticked me off.  

Now for the sandwiches.  While they were good, they were NOT a po boy sandwich.  A po boy has a special sauce that is put on the sandwich.  These were sandwiches that included lettuce, tomato & mayo.  

Also had the fried green tomatoes.  Way too much breading.  I didn't feel like there was a tomato in there.  And I had the milkshake that has nutella & capt crunch.  Very very good, except they ran out of whipped cream.

Will def go back to try more milk shakes (especially the ones spiked with alcohol) and I still would like to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Whoever owns this establishment should be ashamed of themselves. Who changes a hockey bar that is across the street from a HOCKEY ARENA to a Southern restaurant?

Food came out cold, awful service, rude employees. What happened here? Blue Line Grille was awesome. I will never return and encourage others to steer far clear of this place."}
{"text":"8 of us stopped here after work around 5pm. I think there was only 3 or 4 other people in the entire place. after I finished my first beer I noticed everyone else at the table was empty as well. I looked for a waiter or waitress or bartender. There was literally not a single employee in sight. We were there for 2 hours and were able to sneak 3 rounds in. bizarre nonexistent service. I guess I know why it was empty."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying this restaurant opened this past week.  We headed here with 2 of our friends and we're excited for a new restaurant to open and take the place of the ground round.  I was hoping for different, but Buford's has pretty much the same layout as the ground round used to have.  

The waiting staff was relatively uneducated on the drinks and items they were serving, which is understandable because they just opened.  The waitress brought out our waters and spilled the tray onto the table and all over me.  She did offer to give us our first round of beers on the house, however.  

I ordered the Blackened Chicken Po Boy with a side of sweet potato fries.  The chicken was HEAVILY spiced, but I did like the unique flavor. I haven't been to NOLA but I could understand that this might have an authentic southern taste.  My fries came out at room temperature (too cold).

My Girlfriend ordered the BYO Burger, done medium well, and it came out pink in the middle. Not to mention that the person who brought our food out touched her bun (putting it on top of the meat) with her bare hand.  RIGHT IN FRONT OF US!  Really weird.  We had them take the burger back and cook it some more. It ended up being pretty average.

A friend got the garden veggie omelette and said it was rather average.  Potatoes were brought out separate from the omelette.  Toast was brought separate from the both of those.

My other friend ordered the shrimp Po boy, and 5 mins before we got our food was informed that they didn't have any more shrimp.  He was then given the option to have another Po boy and opted for the catfish.  This was actually pretty good.

The saving grace of the night was that the Cap'n Crunch milkshake (Nutella, PB, and Captain Crunch) was on point.  

All in all I was excited about going there but was let down from the get go.  As we were leaving our friend commented \"Honestly, I'd rather go to Primantis.  At least you know what you're getting there.\"  If I go back it will prob be just for milkshakes."}
{"text":"I'd probably go back for an appetizer and a beer, but that's about it.  

I've been looking forward to this restaurant opening for months - I love cool burger bars, and this seemed like it would be one.  Sadly, I was disappointed in almost everything.

Lots of places these days allow you to create your own burger, but they usually offer dozens of different toppings, proteins, buns, rubs, sauces, cheeses, etc., plus they have their own custom burgers to choose from as well.  This place has nothing but BYO burgers on the dinner menu, which cost $10.25.  Twenty additions are listed, and half of them cost an additional $1.00 each.  

The server did come right over to introduce himself, and we placed our drink orders.  Then he came back to confirm my drink order (a Bud Light).  After that he showed up less reliably.  It took quite a long time to place our food orders, somebody else delivered our orders, and he never came back to ask how we liked the food.  We were one of his three tables at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon.

I got the Breakfast Burger, \"add cheddar.\"  The server didn't ask how I wanted the burger done and forgot to add the cheese to my order (I wasn't charged for it, either).  It was an okay burger nonetheless, but nothing special.  It did come with a handful of fries on the side - this isn't mentioned on the menu about this burger, or about the BYO burgers.

My daughter got the Cream Cheese Stuffed French Toast.  We were just totally confused by this item.  It wasn't even pretending to be stuffed - just several (six?  eight?) half slices of thin white bread French toast with a dollop of something on the edge of each slice.  The online menu says it's an herbed goat cheese.  Either my daughter didn't read it correctly or the menu in the restaurant was different, because she would never have ordered that.  In any case, goat cheese is not cream cheese, so that doesn't make sense.

We also shared the Southern Mac 'n Cheese app, which was excellent.  

The food was mediocre and expensive, and the service was terrible.  I'll give the servers a little slack because this location is so new, but there are other local locations, and management should have arranged for the servers to train there for at least a few days before starting at this location.  Because they didn't do that, they've had a poor opening, when guests are deciding whether to return and whether to recommend the place to their friends.

I wanted to love this place, and will give it another try, but from what I saw tonight, they've got a lot of work to do to make this place great.  I hope they pull it off!"}
{"text":"Good five dollar appetizers. Good service. .75 for rocks/ ice absurd!!??  Those few words are too short but I really don't have anything else to say. I'm told it is for an 'extra pour'. I think an upcharge could be stated. Food or alcohol.  Always learning."}
{"text":"Just left Buford's and was even more amazed than our first visit. This time I ordered the Catfish Sandwich. My husband Don, ordered the Catfish Dinner which comes with this amazing Cajun Shrimp Sauce. He asked for the sauce on the side because he thought it was going to be too spicy. It was served in a large bowl with more than an ample portion of shrimp. So of course he had lots to share. My sandwich was huge. I asked for tartar sauce but after tasting the shrimp sauce, I never considered touching the tartar sauce. The first time we came here, our server was Liam. He was such a cool dude and a cutie by the way. He also made sure we had happy hour drinks. This time our server was Joscelyn. She was so much fun as she helped us with the menu. She really made our dinner a delight. She was cute as a button too. The food was cooked to perfection. The catfish was so light and fluffy. Those fries.... mmm. Don't forget to try a milkshake. There's a tasty happy hour menu too. You can also visit Zane at the bar. The atmosphere is relaxed with a nice blend of shiplap and brick walls. There are lots of TV's so you can enjoy your favorite sports or stay current with the news. We are so glad we found this place. It is going to be our \"Go To\" place whenever we come to Pittsburgh. There is so much more to try on the menu. Kudos BK!!! Buford's Kitchen... not Burger King... LOL"}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed with my latest trip to Buford's Kitchen.  I was super excited to get the chicken cakes which I have ordered in the past and they were amazing.  However, I asked for the breakfast menu and the waitress informed me they no longer served breakfast.  What a let down!!  Since I couldn't order breakfast, I chose the braised brisket with mashed potatoes and cornbread.  The brisket I was served was 90% fat with 10% dry meat that I could barely chew.  The cornbread was so dry it fell apart and I had to chase every bite with water.  I would have sent my meal back, but it was lunch and I did not have time to wait for a new meal.  I cannot believe the kitchen would even send out that type of \"meat\" and consider that acceptable for a $15 lunch.  Unfortunately, I will never return to Buford's again which is disappointing as it used to be my favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"Had a good happy hour here with a VERY large group. They were very accommodating of us adding tables, though they weren't very busy regardless. I liked the overall vibe of the place when I walked in. We all had drinks and ordered some entrees. Food was decent, but the fries were very salty. It hit the spot, but not much else seemed memorable. Overall, okay place for happy hour with friendly staff that will happily accommodate a big party. 

Of note: A homeless guy came around to all the tables asking for handouts. Very strange that the staff didn't put a kibosh on that. Made us feel a tad uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great service and food at a reasonable price. The staff really cares about their food and customers, which is rare in today's world. Server Kyle did an excellent job and is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fried Green tomatoes with mozzarella and balsamic.
Cajun shrimp and grits.
And a Sazarac. 
Best southern fare in Pittsburgh area.  I'll be back.
Wait staff on Point. 
Totally worth the money and the drive to Moon."}
{"text":"let me start with this, the first time i was at bufords country kitchen was about a week after they opened and the food was FANTASTIC.i had a burger and gourmet shake and the wife had chicken fingers, everything was cooked great and tasted even better. the place was very very busy and my wife and i were extremely pleased with both service and food. this time however, completely different story. my wife and i took our 2 sons, the bar was completely empty, the tables were also empty and there was only 4 booths with people, so it wasnt very busy at all. within 5 minutes of sitting down we ordered an appetizer, the nachos, and our drinks. about 10 minutes later we ordered our food. as we sat there expecting our nachos, about 15 minutes had went by and our waitress comes out with our meals and tells us the NACHOS we ordered were almost done. REALLY??? at that point i told her to cancel them, it was supposed to be an APPETIZER, which if she didnt know what that is, it comes BEFORE the main meal, NOT AFTER. as we are eating our meal, the manager comes over to our table and judging by what she said, we think the server told her something like we ordered the nachos after we ordered our meal. the manager, SUPER nice lady. ok, so now we are eating our meals, ill start with my son #1 had a burger, all ok, not great but ok, son #2 had ribs, again not great but ok, his shake, peach cobbler, tasted like vanilla ice cream with a few peaches in it, very bad. my wife had brisket and choclate shake. brisket was FANTASTIC, shake, not so much. now comes my meal, i got the southern platter....BIG MISTAKE, huge mistake. the shrimp was actually very good, the catfish was very greasy and mushy, the chicken fingers were over cooked, which was noticeable by the BLACK coating and was quite dry.the AIOLI dipping sauce tasted like pure salt. i got the strawberry shotcake shake, which was frozen strawberries in vanilla ice cream, NO SHORTCAKE at all, actually have better shakes at mcdonalds. we also got a burger and chicken fingers to go for the kids still at home. the burger was good, these chicken fingers were actually cooked well. i hope the server we had is somewhat new, if shes not, she needs to get a different job. the manager did take 10% off, but if thats the way food gets served when they are pretty much dead and almost no customers at all, i dont wanna go there when its busy. if i was in charge there, i would never let food like that leave the kitchen. i honestly doubt that i will ever go back, which is a shame, that place was so damn good when it first opened."}
{"text":"good bar, light on food options so i wouldn't call it a restaurant.  Apps were very good.  Typical bar setting. Marriott valet recomend as a place for a casual dinner, not. We drank a few and went on search for a good meal."}
{"text":"Still at restaurant.  Came in seated quick, but ordered appetizer and dinner at same time.  It's been 48 minutes.  No food.  No revisit from waitress to check on drinks or update on excessive wait for food."}
{"text":"Hopefully they will get better since this was their first night open but...  Where to start...  Menu takes some time and lots of questions to understand exactly what you are getting.  I had a cheeseburger that was just ok.  My wife had an omelet that was runny and came with some sort of red gravy that was not good.  The kids meals were good but the French fries were extremely over seasoned to the point that I could not eat them and I am a fan of salty fries.  Then when the manager came around and asked how everything was, I mentioned the fries and she proceeded to tell me that she had tasted them and that she saw no issue with them.  Not good manager skills.  Just say sorry about that and get some new ones.  To her defense she did get some new ones that were much better.  Not a good start."}
{"text":"Buffords shakes are very hard to beat the peanut butter shake with a shot of bourbon will always be a favorite of mine. The chicken tenders platter is a little pricy but are some of the best tenders I've ever had they were lacking a little salt though. I come to this place mainly for the breakfast and the piggy omelet with a side of Cajun aioli I highly recommend. I will have to go back for dinner and try the grits options as I am a southern at heart!"}
{"text":"Come here before almost all Pens games.  Love the lively atmosphere but only one complaint.  If we are paying $7 for an IPA....don't put it in a plastic cup."}
{"text":"Horrible. Waited 40 minutes for our food. Then once the food came the chicken was hard and I'm not sure it was even \"food\" and not something foreign. The manager never came to our table and when we asked to see him we were told he was too busy. Unacceptable. Unprofessional. Don't waste your time here....too many other places around to go!!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. Went to Buford's for a beer before a pens game with some friends. I didn't realize they were checking IDs right at the door which was my mistake, but the two men were standing off to the side so I just thought they were talking on the sidewalk. Anyway, I went to the door but before I could make it I felt a man's hand on my arm telling me to stop. I turned around, offended that a grown man found it necessary to grab me instead of saying excuse me. He then proceeded to joke with his \"bouncer\" friend that my ID is probably fake. I'm 24. 

I won't be going back. Find some decent people to hire and maybe I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Only giving it a one because there isn't a negative. This was the absolute worst food I've ever had. The food was FREEZING cold and DRY as heck. WAY overpriced and the waitress was terrible. Will never come back. The only reason their in business is because of their location."}
{"text":"We came to Buford's before going to a concert. Upon being seated our waiter came over and took our drink order. We were still waiting for 2 more in our party, but we were famished, so we ordered an appetizer. 20 minutes later our beers finally show up. We ask about the app and he says he will check on it. 30 minutes into our adventure with Buford's our app finally arrives at our table. But it was the wrong appetizer. We had ordered the Sweet Smothered Fries and he brought us the creole dip. 

My fiancé was seconds away from a hangry melt down so we told the waiter it was wrong, but we would keep it. Now, when you're THAT hungry everything tastes good, right? Wrong. The chips were stale. Tough, chewy, and not an ounce of crunchy salty goodness to them. Again, our waiter comes back, and I tell him. He takes the app out from in front of my now extremely hangry fiancé. 
Eventually the waiter did bring our first app and did not charge us for the incorrect dip. But they still charged us for the fries. Which feels as though its In poor taste for the amount of time we waited for them. 

Now, you might be thinking, 6 PM on a Friday across from a venue that is hosting a concert. This place is probably extremely busy which would be understandable that we've been here 40 minutes and still have not been able to put our order in. Again, WRONG. There were people there, but many open tables. 

Our other friends had arrived in this time so we wanted to put in our order. I ordered the Buford burger with Jack cheese and a fried green tomato and pickles. My fiancé also ordered a burger with a jack and Coke milkshake and our other friend ordered a salad. 20 minutes later the food was on our table. Yet my burger had regular tomato... No fried green tomato. 

At this point I was far too annoyed to say one more thing to our waiter. However my fiancés milkshake had yet to arrive. He called our waiter over and the waiter said, and I quote, \"our milkshake guy just got off work and the next one hasn't come in yet.\" 

So you have ONE person in the restaurant that can make milkshakes?!?!?!? Our waiter then went and made said milkshake (so I'm not sure WHY he didn't do this in the first place instead of making some sorry excuse). 

Overall the food was average. My burger was a bit salty. The smothered fries were lacking. The chips were stale. The shake was tasty!!! But not worth the hassle. We will not be returning and I do not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I can always count on great food here! He burgers are to die for!! However the cocktails were a bit iffy for my liking and overpriced."}
{"text":"Came here after living in Pittsburgh as a college student, expecting decent bar food, but was actually really impressed by my meal. I got the fried chicken po'boy with fried- It was huge, fresh, flavorful and I feel like it's hard to do fried chicken without making you feel overwhelmingly tired or full after, but this was just cooked perfectly. 

Service was fast and great and it's always wonderful to be greeted with a smile!"}
{"text":"I came here last night for drinks and dinner before the pens game, and loved it so much we came for drinks again after the game! Our server was super friendly and the burgers we got were delish! I got the grilled chicken sandwich and my friend got the bacon burger. Will definitely be back the next time i have to go to PPG for an event."}
{"text":"I had the catfish po boy at lunchtime. Service was very slow for only having 5 or 6 tables of patrons. But that was excusable for me. What was not excusable is that the sandwhich tasted really really fishy, more so than I thought normal....and a few hours later I got very sick. I will never eat here again. I can not say for sure that the sandwhich is what made me sick, but it's the only thing I ate all day and up until that point I felt perfectly fine. The next 24 hours were hell."}
{"text":"What to say here is that my waitress and I were on the same wave length.  

Setting:  Game 7 (Away) of the Pens vs Caps.

Mood:  Needed to drink but needed some food :)

Order:   I ordered the fried chicken Po' Boy (recommended by waitress) and Guinness / with Shot of Jameson.

It was a quiet night.  She kept my glasses filled.  The food was good.   The Penguins won and closed out the series!   Overall awesome night!

I would recommend this place  :)"}
{"text":"We went to Buford's kitchen before going to the pens game. They have the best nachos ever! The bar food is great and the service was awesome. We came when it was fairly busy and our server was so fast and our food came out quickly as well! I would definitely recommend this places for some drinks and food before a sporting event down town or just for some fun! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Had a pretty decent meal here. However, the customer service is horrible. I was there for lunch on a Sunday. When Monday came I had realized I had left my sunglasses there on the table. So when I called they said they had found nothing and that they would call me if they did. She never asked me any detail or description of where I was sitting or what kind of sunglasses they were. It was very odd. So two days later I decided to call again and speak to a manager. She offered no apology and said well maybe the bus boy threw them away? Who throws away sunglasses? Then when I asked if they had surveillance, she paused and said \"yes, but I'm not sure what angles it films.\" Then proceeded to tell me the GM would call me and it's been 4 days now with no phone call.  It's really disappointing that they couldn't even act a little bit concerned or offer me an apology even. My husband works right by the restaurant and was ordering lunch there almost everyday but now neither one of us will be giving them our business. It's a shame too because it was nice to have somewhere different to eat in moon."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever last night before a concert.  Went in for drinks and dinner, had about an hour wait to get a table which was ok, got a table ordered food then the disaster started from there. Three of us all ordered the same thing fried catfish Po'boy sandwich , husband ordered a specialty burger all supposed to come with crab fries. Food comes, asked specifically for no tomatoes on sandwiches of course there were tomatoes on all of them, then my husbands burger wasn't even close to the burger he ordered , no crab fries for anyone and the worst of the worst I bit into my fish sandwich and it was literally raw uncooked rubbery fish.  The waiter whom I immediately informed of this told me \"well we are really busy and haven't had a concert for awhile \" THIS IS AN EXCUSE FOR SERVING ME RAW FOOD, we spent like $200 in this place. Plus it's right across from the Pittsburgh Pens arena with many many busy nights recently. Manager was an idiot with little customer service skills. Will never recommend this place or even go there."}
{"text":"It would be almost easy for this place to be a five star worthy establishment.  The location is great for pens games and other events at ppg.  The inside and outside areas are perfectly done and make for a great place to meet up with friends.  However, if you are looking to do anything other than get a drink, this is not the place to go.

The menu is limited and the place seems confused with what it wants to be.  For appetizers they do not have any traditional bar type appetizers, i.e. Cheese sticks, wings, etc.  Instead they have weird things like fried green tomatoes and fried oysters.  I'm not saying these things aren't good, they are, but you when you are dealing with people who want to have beers and apps before a pens game, people want something simple.  At least have the option.  It is not hard or costly to have some frozen fried apps in the back.  

The rest of the food is also just mediocre.  The one thing I will say is delicious are the chicken tenders.  They seem to be hand breaded and are delicious.

I wish they would make some menu improvements, but it is a fun place, and really the only place to go before a pens game."}
{"text":"We came for lunch. The waitress was friendly. I quite like the decor. I ordered a brisket sandwich. I was very disappointed when it was bland with little flavor. The crispy onion straws were very hard. The cheez whiz-like sauce was bland. The bread was just ok. The sweet potato fries were good. The side salad with ranch dressing was good. I cannot recommend based on the taste of my main dish."}
{"text":"Three solid stars means I would be back and perhaps try what they may be famous for, which seems to be milk shakes and breakfast. I went today for lunch with a friend of mines from a unit that is very close ( I love her to pieces but she doesn't use Yelp ) 

So we ate where she wanted to and landed here. The welcome was very nice and the food was ok. I had the shrimp and catfish and the catfish was pretty good and the shrimp was okay nothing special just some fried shrimp. A little more greasy than I. Or ally like. The French fries were pretty good. The service was good as well.

The next him I go if I end up back here I will definitely try the breakfast since that seems to be what my friend was raving about and apparently the milk shakes are the bees knees. I will probably wonder back here. Not an over all bad experience:-) 3 solid stars"}
{"text":"Advertises \"southern\" food with a \"New Orleans\" flare. We didn't really find that to be the case. 
There are some southern dishes listed on the menu, but the ones we tried were not in anyway authentic \"southern\" dishes. 

The menu itself is also odd. For dinner entrees you have a choice of \"build your own burger\" and a chicken finger sandwich. \"Build your own burger\" is a bit misleading though. You really only get to pick your toppings. Then there is a selection of sandwiches and the back of the menu is filled with breakfast items.

I went with the chicken finger sandwich and my fiancé went with a shrimp po boy. The chicken fingers were the same frozen fried chicken fingers that everyone else has and were not seasoned. The Po boy wasn't really a true po-boy. Just frozen breaded shrimp on bread. The food was average to below average - basically just your typical everyday pub food but they charged a premium for it. Way too much money for what was served.

To top it off, we were seated by the kitchen and were treated to the sound of the wait staff arguing with one another all night. 

The upside - they have a selection of bbq sauces on the table and the one sauce I tried was really good."}
{"text":"It's hilarious the number local places that have great ratings based on \"huge portions\" or how inexpensive they are (both red flags in my book).  This place has really poor reviews for silly reasons ('not my kind of food' reviews).

Admittedly, the place has the feel of a chain, in that things are highly styled and up-kept.  It does appear to be one of three locations, and they were all created by a restauranteur group, so there is no confusing this with a grass roots family restaurant.

However, the menu has great variety (within southern cuisine), and the two meals I tried here I would order again (first was southwest omelette with side of cheddar grits, second was shrimp and grits - this was slightly oily, but it was a spicy oil added deliberately).  My wife also raved about the \"Hair of the dog\" Bloody Mary (and this is her drink).

Anyhow, definitely worth checking out - don't believe the (negative) hype."}
{"text":"Service basics, need to go back to school. Great local Pittsburgh restaurant that serves breakfast all day, but NOT THIS LOCATION across the street from the home of the Penguins. The good - fried green tomatoes, how could that be bad?  Huge portions as well. All I will remember is the service though, which was a wait to be sat in a 3/4 empty restaurant, a wait to be able to order, no service check after entree delivered, no coffee refill, a 30 minute wait for the check after finishing, a 10 minute wait to collect my card after delivering the check that late - honestly this is a would not go back! Only image when full and in Hockey season?"}
{"text":"Save your time and money. There was nothing about this place that I cared for. 

First off the sign outside still says Blue Line Grill (which was a place we liked). This seems a little misleading right from the start. 

Second, my food was lackluster in both portion size and quality. I ordered the po boy. Ever had a po boy in Louisiana?  You know then you shouldn't leave hungry. The shrimp were over cooked and it was like they tried to mask it with a ton of mayo. 

The best advice I can offer you is to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food. Any plane with Tony Chacheres on the table knows something about southern food."}
{"text":"Buford's Kitchen has a few things going for it.  First of all, it's name.  I have no idea who Buford is, but the name itself lends it some of the unique characteristics this place needs. This place is spacious, and can hold a crowd quite comfortably. Its outdoor terrace and proximity to PPG Arena earns it 5 stars, but they are quickly taken away because of the things Buford's doesn't have going for it.

The menu is not very appealing, food ordered lacked any flavor. Our server didn't seem to understand the concept of waiting on tables, which led to a low tab on his part. Not so sure how soup is any harder to serve over a milkshake, but it became a struggle to get.

TV monitors around the bar area are blocked by low hanging lights, thus causing one to have neck pain by the time the game you are trying to watch is over.  It became annoying to constantly wonder what just occurred on the screen due to your field of vision being blocked.

Take my advice about your visit to Buford's to watch a game, go, but focus on sitting in an area that offers a clear view of the TV, settle on the beverage options, and make sure your server knows how to smile."}
{"text":"So we went there on a whim cause we were looking for a quick place to eat. 

Pros: The waitress was really nice, we came in towards the tail end of Happy Hour and she made sure that we got our order in before Happy Hour was over so that we could still got the Happy Hour price. Another pro is the milkshakes and drinks. I had the Orange Margarita and the Peach Milkshake, and My mother had the Strawberry Shortcake Milkshake, all three were delicious. Another Pro is that they give you huge portion sizes for a relatively low price. 

Cons: as far as con's the food while it looked beautiful, the flavor of the food we ordered was just Meh. I ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and the Fried Shrimp Po Boy for my dinner, my meal was edible and good, but it really isn't anything to write home about. My mom ordered the chicken strips for her meal and the pulled pork Nachos for her appitizer. She enjoyed her meal but she's said that the food was just alright. 

In conclusion we're definitely coming back at a later date for milkshakes and drinks. But I think that we'll pass on the food next time"}
{"text":"Food was bad, server was worse.  Went for lunch this afternoon around 2:30.  Place was empty but had to wait for 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated.  Once seated waited another 10 minutes for server to come over, which was ok since it was first time in restaurant and we were looking at menu, but we hadn't seen her in dining room that entire time.  When waitress did come over, it was clear she had been outside for a cigarette break, and she wreaked of cigarettes.   She forced her friendliness but it came off more as we were interrupting her work.  Food took a while to arrive (25 minutes) and wife's grits (she had ordered Shrimp and Grits) were room temperature.  She ate the shrimp which was ok, but the grease/butter was poured all over the grits and seemed to be more burned than Cajun.  my son and I had burgers.  They were good but the \"Cajun\" fries came out with no seasoning and I had to put the creole seasoning on that was sitting at table with salt (which looked like it had small bugs in it) and pepper.  Father had breakfast.  He ate everything but the potatoes which looked greasy.  Server filled our drinks and reached over table after filling mine and grabbed straw out of it.  Just seemed to have no class.  After we finished eating, I wife turned to me and and said something about server.  Next thing I know, she brings over a dirty dish and sets it on our table while she gathers our dirty dishes.  She offers us dessert.  When we decline she points to the empty dish and asks us if we are sure we don't want to try the Oreo pie because it's so good.  I about fell out of my seat.  Who has ever been sold on a piece of pie by pointing to someone else's dirty dish your server has placed on your table.  Needless to say, we won't be going back. 

Any diners looking for a good restaurant in the area, I suggest you keep driving.  In my opinion, this is not it!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food, and a nice drink/milkshake selection. It's a great addition to Moon Township which is severely lacking in restaurants."}
{"text":"We went before a Pens game and the place was packed!
Good pizza, burgers, and sandwiches before a PPG Paints Arena event.  We had 5 kids with us.
Pizzas, burgers, tuna tacos, nachos, breadsticks, fried green tomatoes - all good."}
{"text":"I and 7 others went to Buford's for lunch on a Tuesday. There were three different groups in the place, probably 15 people total. Not busy AT ALL. We're seated and told, after we order drinks, that they won't split a check for more than 4 people. Now this is an understandable policy when it is crowded. Not when it is empty. We inquire as to whether or not we can just split up to which we were told no. Waitress was very rude and this is just pure laziness."}
{"text":"Thought it would be way better then what it was. The menu was limited should have
More the things, and tad on the pricy side for what it is. The best thing they have was the key lime  tequila milkshakes."}
{"text":"Incredible staff, fast, friendly! Food was too notch, they do it right that! And location is perfect for penguins game or anything at PPG Arena! Way to go"}
{"text":"We dropped in for a quick dinner before going to a show @ppg (paints) arena and started with some fried green tomatoes followed up with a couple of po' boys and it was all so good and Candice (from Texas) was amazing juggling the rush of people!"}
{"text":"Six days after our horrifyingly nightmarish experience at Buford's, I am still at a loss of words to fully explain what occurred... so let me try my best to break it down. (Just to give a bit of background, nine of us made a reservation here last Thursday night for dinner at 6pm before seeing an 8pm show at Consol.)

-Entire table received their meals while one poor soul waited OVER AN HOUR for a sandwich, which was exactly like everyone else's, but for some reason took three times longer to make
-Waited OVER AN HOUR for nachos, which I had to ask our waiter about and which were delivered ten minutes later... cold and very soggy (think, liquid chips)
-Made clear that we had a show starting shortly and there was ZERO sense of urgency to deliver our food and give us our checks
-Checks were delivered and were COMPLETELY WRONG, as if someone had gone to the computer and started randomly mashing buttons
-Manager was called and appeared wearing a very unprofessional white strappy tank and black jogger pants, as if we had just woken her up from a Sunday afternoon nap
-Absolutely no apologies were made for (1) delivering food very slowly, (2) screwing up all the checks and (3) making us late to our show
-Waited... and waited... and WAITED for the checks to be processed, which took well over 10-15 minutes to run two credit cards and a gift card, thus making us late to our show

Now, let me pause for a moment... I am called \"namaste\" at work as I can bring calmness and coolness to any environment... except Buford's Kitchen, that is. So with that in mind...

-Stood next to manager and associate as they slowly processed checks, inquiring about their progress, and BEGAN TO ARGUE WITH THE MANAGER and had a gift card shoved in my face

Yep, that happened. Congrats, Buford Kitchen, for being my restaurant of choice if I had to make a recommendation to my worst enemy.

There is absolutely NO EXCUSE that they were entirely unprepared for a large crowd of people - and lots of reservations - before a show.

If you couldn't tell from the above, I will not be returning here ever again, even if the name changes again.

***P.S. Thankful for a group of friends who quickly moved past the incident and still had a ton of fun at the show. Thanks, Jim Gaffigan, for saving the evening!

***P.P.S. Still feeling badly for the table of six next to us who received their dinners at 8:05pm and discussed whether or not they should just leave. They probably literally missed over half the show..."}
{"text":"A group of us went here before the John Bon Jovi concert this evening. The service was less than acceptable but the food was terrible. We would've complained and sent the food back, but the waitress didn't come back to our table for almost 30 minutes. By that time, we needed to go to the concert. I understand this is a destination bar for  big events, but spend your money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Worst service. Cold food. Poor management. Avoid this place to eat if you are going to a game you won't make it in time. Waitress had an attitude and avoided us."}
{"text":"I went here, solo, not long after the place opened.  To begin with, it was very crowded, and I was seated at a table at a window.  Ordinarily I prefer a window table, but this was an extremely cold evening,  and they were having a heating problem.  As in, NONE, and even cold air blowing.  Most people, myself included, wore coats the entire time.  I personally HATE to be cold, so this was strike one.  When I was given a menu, I was astounded at how limited it was--mainly po'boys and build-your-own burgers, and very little else.  Now let me say that when I dine out alone, I rarely check the prices because I choose places where paying a check for one person is never a problem.  That being said, I ordered a peach cobbler alcoholic shake and a build-your-own burger.  The shake was AWESOME, very flavorful, and you get not only a glassful, but also extra in one of those old metal shake cups.  The burger, to which I added cheese and grilled onions, was a goodly size and was very tasty with good melty cheese and lots of onions grilled just right.  Then the check came.  I discovered that the shake was $10. Okay, it was creative and had a shot of booze in it, but still, it's just a shake!  I could see $6, or even $7 if you really pushed it...but $10??  Wow.  The total amount was close to $28 FOR ONE PERSON, add on a {generous} tip, and I feel that's waaaay too high for this area.  So, given the extremely limited menu and what I feel is overpricing, it's very likely that I won't go back.  Pity, really.  I was hoping for a great very local place at which to be a regular."}
{"text":"Friendly service from Security and bar staff!!Hostess was VERY rude, if I didn't have to deal with her, I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"While in town covering the Pens/Caps series, we've had at least one meal every day at Buford's. No complaints! Great food across the menu...from the build your own burger, to the Nutella French toast, to the fried green tomatoes, to the fall off the bone ribs, to the heavenly pulled pork nachos. We've tried quite a bit, and it's all great. Highly recommend this place. Let's Go Pens!"}
{"text":"I just started working in the area so I've been out and about trying the places nearby. Buford's looked like a winner and if this review was based strictly on the food, it would be. Sadly, I have to echo what many others have said and give a lower rating because of so-so service. I went with a group of 3 others from work around 11:30a and it wasn't too busy so we were sat quickly. We all got waters which were brought out fairly quick.  3 decided to share the Buford Size Chicken Tenders while I got the Blackened Chicken Po'Boy after being told my original order of the Catfish Po'Boy couldn't be filled because hey we're out of Catfish on a Tuesday. It took a decent amount of time for our food to come out despite it not being busy and the sauces we asked for were not brought. We had to ask a second time for them. And even at that the waiter went off and did other things before finally bringing them. He even stated, I forgot again. We had a heck of a time getting his attention for refills and for the check.  It was just very apparent that we were not a top priority at the time and the waiter even commented that he had a lot of other work to do. It really took away from an otherwise excellent experience because the food was fantastic!  I highly recommend the Blackened Chicken Po'Boy with a side of Cajun Aioli sauce for the fries. It was so good. And with a $9 price tag it was a good value. And the Buford Size Chicken Tender Platter was massive!  I just wish the service could live up to the food. I'll give it another try sometime but for such a prime location I would expect more.

***UPDATE***  I went back recently with a large group from work for a party and was much more pleased with the service this go around.  For a large group, our waitress did an excellent job over the course of a few hours.  We mostly stuck to appetizers and I really enjoyed the nachos."}
{"text":"I usually go here for Happy Hour every so often because its very close to my work. Happy Hour prices aren't the greatest to be honest. 

Recently I went here for Lunch with some people from work. There was 8 of us but only one other couple in the entire restaurant. It took an hour and a half to get our food. The Pizza was pretty good but i had to scarf it down so i could run back to work. If it had been busy I could see but there was really no excuse for it to take that long.

I'm sure I'll be back for happy hour but I doubt I'll be dining here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good food, but the price has gone up significantly over the past few months. They always seem busy and unorganized."}
{"text":"The first part of the story starts like this - two visits, one a couple months after the grand opening and then a couple months ago. Service was terrible, bartenders were unfriendly - all of the staff seemed clueless and unhappy. Very unwelcoming environment. We weren't going to ever go back. 

Fast forward . . . September 2016. By accident, we ended back at Buford's and have since been back a few times. They now have a happy hour (5-7 p.m.) with half priced drinks and appetizers. The bartender (Debbie) is friendly, happy, and welcoming. The management staff are new faces - they smile, and seem to care about their patrons. More of a local, casual, and happy vibe now. Although the deep fried oysters aren't part of the happy hour prices, they are worth it - delicious. Fried green tomatoes - tasty. Black bean burgers and fries - excellent. And, nothing was greasy. 

A successful restaurant is all about good customer service and good food (if you can be \"great\" - even better). If Buford's keeps this up, they may be packed during happy hours and will have no problem gaining more dedicated patrons. Great to have a local establishment to frequent again. Thanks to the owners for making the much needed change!"}
{"text":"Great place to go before Penguins games.  It's crowded but worth it for the atmosphere and drinks.  Food not great but always a good time.  Everyone is always in a great mood and spirits are always high!!"}
{"text":"This was the second time we ate at Buford's, we noticed the menu was very different which they acknowledged, we felt the food wasn't as good as the first time we ate there. They had some small mishaps for example no sooner did we get our appetizers which was a house salad and a soup that they told me was chicken vegetable but it definitely wasn't chicken vegetable and it wasn't that good, they brought our Meals out, which like I said was way too soon I was only six bites into my soup but I don't mind something like this so much because I would rather them bring it out to quickly than food sitting in the back under lamps or whatever, but the weird part about that was our sweet potato fries came out cold. The buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered was bland and had an odd smell to it the Cajun meatloaf was good, but overall the food was disappointing. We were rooting for this place, but I'm worried. On a last note the server was great no problems there very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu"}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant in moon. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Really good milkshakes and burgers!"}
{"text":"Excellent bar food, good service, and big game fun atmosphere for Penguins games.  Check out their 4th floor balcony and bar for events and big games."}
{"text":"Well I was so excited to try a new place-somewhat disappointed.  Ordered a burger and side salad.  No blue cheese salad dressing.  The waitress asked when I wanted my salad and I said whatever is easiest for her.  The burger was ordered medium and was served well.  The salad was forgotten about and brought after my sandwich was almost finished.  The server admitted to forgetting about the salad.  The salad had processed croutons-yuck.  I usually love burgers but this one had no flavor-thumbs down.  My husband and another friend who joined us enjoyed there food is why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Across the street from the PPG Paints Areana the food is great. The staff is awesome, and the vibe is on point. The fried green tomatoes are a must!"}
{"text":"I can only hope that the unkind woman at the hostess station is an owner and therefore only impacting her own wallet by having such a terrible, anti-guest, attitude.  I appreciate that the hours prior to a Penguins game are chaotic, however, when you tell a party of two that there will be an hour wait,  roll your eyes and sigh when asked if food is served at the bar, and then ANGRILY, SNARKILY, and DISMISSIVELY tell the guests they are wrong when they let you know there are at least eight tables open and would like to confirm that it's really an hour wait, you should not be in customer service, EVER.  We only wanted to spend lots of money on your highly recommended food and drinks - so sorry for being a bother.  The local bar down the road was having a cookout and giveaways  and were happy to provide service with a smile."}
{"text":"I hate to write a review for a place I did not actually eat or drink at, but the lack of eating/drinking was not my choice, hence the 1 star review. Three friends and I attempted to grab drinks and appetizers last weekend before heading over to an event at Consol and when we walked in, the place was busy, but there were several open bar tables in the seat yourself area. After about 15 minutes of attempting to get the attention of a server, bartender, hostess...heck, ANY employee, and failing, we decided to get up. Some people at the table next to us said \"that's why the women before you left; they never got served.\" While the employees were busy ignoring us, they were standing around texting and being generally inconsiderate. At one point, we tried to wave down a bartender and he looked right at us and walked away."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch and was pleasantly surprised!  I had a fried shrimp po boy and it was really good. I would of rather had fries instead of chips which comes with it, but all in all a good sandwich. 
The gentleman I was with had a burger that looked really good as well.
Look forward to going back with my family."}
{"text":"Disappointing lunch all around today. 
Service was great but the food missed the mark. 

Gumbo was good and seasoned well. 

Jambalaya was incredibly bland, lacked spice and any level of heat. 

Sandwiches were served on buns that were not fresh. 

I'll not return unless for the happy hour and drinks!"}
{"text":"Recently my friend Greg and I wanted to go out to lunch. He usually works overnights so it is rare that we have a day off together. I will say that last Friday was the day that the stars aligned and we were able to enjoy a nice lunch out on the town. We wanted to do something new and something that we haven't tried before. Since we both work and live in the Lawrenceville/Bloomfield area we wanted to go outside of our comfort zone. I was working at Mercy and on my way to Shadyside was just voice texting him restaurants that I was passing on Forbes Ave. Of course he was sleeping and did not get the texts until later but once he did he said that Buford's Kitchen seems nice. I agreed. What is weird is that as an elite Yelper I actually did not read any of their reviews other than to use the app to send him the address. I was astounded to see that after we went their it has such a negative Yelp status. Honestly, that is CRAZY to me. Greg and I had a wonderful time here. The staff was so helpful and nice, the restaurant was super clean, and the food was fantastic. We even ordered drinks and they not only came out quickly when I was asking about a beer Greg ordered the waitress brought over the bar manager to tell me a little bit about it. What great service!!

The waitress we had took the time to go over her favorites and the best sellers of the restaurant. She was wonderful. And all of our picks were spot on because of her.

Appetizer:

Fried Green Tomato with Remoulade Sauce, Scallion Aioli. There were 4 slices of tomatoes on the platter that came out. They were drizzled with the remoulade and aioli and they were delish. I think that the tomatoes could have been a bit of a thicker slice but overall they were filling. I think also for the price there could have been maybe double the amount of tomatoes on the plate. Green tomatoes are not that expensive and with them being so thin, add a few more to the plate!

Andouille Gumbo: This was dang tooting good. I think I could have licked the plate clean and I even mentioned to the waitress to not be shocked if she saw me licking the bowl. The rue that the gumbo was made in was spot on, the sausage tasted amazing, and the who experience was magnificent. I had a cup, should have went with a bowl.

Main Course:

I ordered the Po' Boy for my main food. Because if you are going to try the southern restaurant you better have a heck of a good po' boy. I picked the Oyster po' boy because oysters are one of my favorite foods and fried oysters as just amazing. The po' boy came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickles. I added extra tomatoes and onions to my sandwich because I am difficult and I love tomatoes and onions. I will say that standard the sandwich comes with fries, The waitress said we could sub it out for any of the sides on the menu. Again this is where good service comes in. I asked her how the coleslaw was because I am a bit of a coleslaw snob. I do not like like weird coleslaw or slaw that is made with miracle whip (which is disgusting in my book). She went to the back and got me a little serving dish of the coleslaw for me and Greg to try. That is wonderful service. I hated it so was grateful for her allowing me to try it out. I went with the mixed veggies instead. I will say, I asked what the veggies were and she told me broccoli, carrots, and something else. When it came out it was just zucchini, squash, and onions. Not at all my jam. I ate them and looked longingly at Greg's fries. I would not have picked that as a nice side veggie to eat but since I ate all the fried food, it was ok. I will also say that the veggies were caked in butter. They must be steamed or cooked in a ton of butter. I was a little taken aback by the amount of butter in the bowl, but just kind of went with it. 

The service and the food were wonderful. I would come back any day. I think that it is a nice little lunch spot and the service is excellent. I look forward to eating some more of their meals!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Reasonable prices, friendly staff. Really liked the different choices of craft beer. Would recommend this place.

Reason I didn't give 5 stars because it wasn't the best food ever but very good"}
{"text":"Good food, but prices are too high for what you get.  I don't mind paying for good food, just didn't feel like that was a $12 cheeseburger they pulled out of the freezer."}
{"text":"I went here before the chili peppers concert. We got there around 4:00pm before it was packed. The food was horrible and nothing like the Buford's in Moon. I ordered the chicken fingers and my friend ordered a burger. The food came out within minutes of ordering. It was so fast that we initially told the server it was the wrong table because we had just ordered. The fries on both dishes were hot but the chicken and burger were barely warm. My chicken looked like it sat under a heat lamp for a couple days. Neither of us could stomach the food enough to finish the entire dish. The only good thing about the visit was that the server made sure we had drinks. If it wasn't for the server, I would be asking Yelp to allow negative stars."}
{"text":"Well, it isn't like the greatest meal I've ever had.  But the pancrepes and chicken were really good.  My husband LOVED his burger and it looked really good.  

The Bloody Mary was strong and very tasty.   We arrived late and they were closing in 30 minutes, but still managed to give us great service.  

I am tempted to give them five stars because he price was really reasonable - but for now I am sticking with four.  I woulda gone five if they would have offered regular fried chicken instead of only tenders.  The tenders were good but when I think of southern food, bone in fried is the only way.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Just drove into town and stumbled onto this place. Loved the decor (rustic/funky) and window seating 
Wasn't really hungry but the crawfish quesadilla was something I had never seen before and so ordered it.  Glad I did....was amazing!!!!  If I am ever in Pittsburgh again I will be returning."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is busy is because people don't know how bad it is before they get in. We arrived at 615, it is now 635 and we finally gave in to the beer tub girl with her singular beer options. Zero eye contact made by any bartender, tried to bribe a server to get us two beers, no luck. Unfortunately this place will continue to get busy before games because no one knows any better and its location across from the arena. Only two stars because the lady at the beer tub was so friendly."}
{"text":"We cme to town early before the Pens/Bruins game at PPG Arena and looked at a couple of places to eat and drink. We decided to give Bufords a chance since I saw fried oysters on their menu!
Yum! I remember Grandpap Maguire making them on Christmas and New Years Eve, but I digress...  so we ordered the fried green tomatoes, a small order of chicken and fries and of course the fried oysters! The Yuengling was cold and my wife was loving the Lemon martinis! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Well didn't take long we're back to Blueline Grille standards. Sorry service for 3rd time. People lined up at door while 3 staff were standing around nearby. No cutlery, asked 3 times gave up. Ordered food was never asked how we wanted it cooked. Had to ask to have filthy table wiped down .   Who the hell trains this staff ??? Do they know what it means to provide customer service ???  Get help !!Live locally will never go back."}
{"text":"Darn good burger,  great fries and a wonderful wait staff.  Best place I visited in the area.  To top it off,  it was very well priced."}
{"text":"Wow, lots of fried food. Fried green tomatoes, fried catfish, fried oysters, and it's it's not fried it come with bacon, pork belly, pancetta, or something else fried. So, this is a place you may want to stay away from if you're a vegan, or, a recent heart bypass or replacement patient.

I started out with the green tomatoes, nothing special, a lot of salt was needed to add some flavor. Hurricane Katrina, my friend who can never order anything from the menu unless she asks 19 questions and makes 31 changes to the item she orders had the fried oysters. 

For dinner I chose cheesy shrimp and grits. Again, it lacked salt, pepper, and cheese. The grits were creamy, the shrimp were over done by a hair, tasty though, having seen some Creole seasoning in the skillet. This was a one and done for me. I wasn't impressed and way too unhealthy style of cooking. 

This is in the former Ground Round building in the Giant Eagle Plaza on University Boulevard."}
{"text":"Walked in and got yelled out by the security who was watching the pens games instead of being at the door to then have our ids checked again after waiting 25 minutes for service which we had to ask for when it was completely dead. The girl waitress said they need service now with extreme attitude. Tried ordering a milkshake off the tiniest menu apparently completely out of every kind? Tried ordering a root beer out... ginger ale out? So got a water with a dirty glass. Got an appetizer for the table brings out one thing of  silverware.  Will not be back again. It's a shame what this use to be and now has turned into. Other tables around us complaining too.No wonder it was dead during a pens playoff. I've been a server for 5 years never wrote a review this is hands down the worst service. We don't even know our servers name. He started giving us our change back at the table .. last time I checked you go in the back to figure the change out. One of the worst experiences yet"}
{"text":"I don't know about the low rating, this place is awesome. Takes a little longer but worth it. The chicken fingers, fried green tomatoes, and corn bread are out of this world! The grilled chicken salad comes with warm spiced honey that is soo good. Never had breakfast there but it looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Buford's is your standard Pittsburgh sports bar. I came here last night before the Pens game and expected to wait a heck of a lot longer than we actually did. I arrived at 5:45 and put our name in and we were seated about 30 minutes after that. Ordered a steak salad (which I expected to be a lot bigger) but it was the perfect amount! Besides the crowd, everything was in working order. The service was fast and friendly and the food was an overall good price point. The only thing I wish I would have requested was to get a table AWAY from the door/windows. It was about 15 degrees out and you could feel everything."}
{"text":"Holy Trainwreck!  I stopped in with my son for lunch during a non busy time expecting so so much more.  First it took them forever for the guy at the front to \"find\" us a table.  There were only a dozen or so people there.  Once seated we had the pleasure of checking out all the ikea lighting fixtures thoroughly while waiting for the waitstaff to figure out if we really wanted eat here or not.  Upon ordering our food and waiting about 30 minutes we were informed that they are out of potatoes (I ordered a baked potato with my sandwich) but could instead substitute it with french fries (which are made from potatoes right)?  While after another 30 minutes or so our food came out as cold as could be.  We attempted to eat instead of asking for another super long wait for another meal.  But alas we had no silverware.  I found some near the hostess stand and helped myself.  Also, I don't think anyone ever refilled our drinks even though we sat there for over an hour waiting for our food.  Once the bill came I was still charged for the baked potato.. Ugh.  I know this place is new but the lack of disorganization and lackluster service is not an excuse."}
{"text":"It's Super Bowl Sunday and I came here with the Anaheim Ducks fan club.  We booked an area here, as it was near our hotel  for us to watch the Big Game.  Buford's used to be called the Blue Line Grille, and the outside still has the old sign.  From what we heard, they literally transformed their menu a few weeks ago from a Southern style food to burgers and comfort food.

Ducks Radio guy Steve Carroll stopped by to chat with the fans, and we each got 2 tickets for almost any drink we wanted, from beer to cocktails to Pepsi items.  In addition, the fans got to pick 2 squares in the Road Crew SB Pool, to win autographed pucks and other Duck prizes.

The Road Crew ordered plenty of food: pizza, chicken strips, pasta, beef sliders. and we had a ton of food.  I wouldn't say it was the best food we've had from a bar, but Buford's Kitchen did a great job. Also, considering we had one person taking care of our group, our server was ok too.  Occasionally, he would forget an order, or bring the wrong drink, but overall, decent service, and decent bar food.

Overall, since we were far from California, it was a fun event, and we had a great time here."}
{"text":"I've been here once, it was back in January when they were first becoming Buford's. Gotta say I wasn't impressed. Prices are comparable with higher end, crowd is douchey and staff are rude and douchey as well. Food was mediocre at best. So many amazing, locally owned places in the 'Burgh to choose from so won't be going back."}
{"text":"Call ahead before you go for dinner. They do not adhere to the posted hours. They close at will, especially when there is an event at the PPG Arena. They will close when the event starts. Attempted to go 3 nights in a row and each night they closed early. Frequented Buford's often but will not return. There are enough great restaurants downtown to choose from so don't have to put up with the discourteous management."}
{"text":"They have a small simple menu so i hoped that they could master the few options they have. Prices are high. I ordered a $10.50 steak burger medium rare (added i like some pink). Its supposed to come with lettuce and tomato, i added grilled onions and bacon with a side of ranch. Got burger, even had a lil plastic thingy that said medium rare but they must have mixed mine up with someone who ordered theirs well done. Also had no lettuce or tomato, and no side of ranch. Meat was very dry and obviously no pink. I waited for waitress for 10 mins before she came back to finally bring me the missing items. Burger cold at this point. 10.50$! Not worth it at all. 

Also my fathers burger was over cooked also.

Ordered Margarita pizza for 17$ and it tasted alright but it was really chincy and tomatoes were few and far in between. Maybe they should charge 8$ for pizza. That would have made it worth it.

Fried green tomatoes were actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Went to Buford's for lunch today on an unseasonably warm February due in part to the opened garage doors. Even though the place wasn't too busy we waited for about 10 min to get seated. We finally gave up and decided to eat at the bar. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich with coleslaw. The bartender/hostess/waitress was doing everything as they appeared to be very understaffed. She was extremely nice, but she could only do so much. A few patrons in for the Flyers game also sat at the bar, but decided to leave when the wait was too long. The food however came out really quick and the sandwich was decent. However, we waited forever for our check. We were anxious to get out in the sun on our way back to work. The bartender/hostess/waitress apologized and explained that they didn't expect this large of a crowd for lunch, but due to the weather it was busier than expected. In closing, the place really needs to staff accordingly as this has been an ongoing issue. Kudos to the bartender/waitress/hostess who didn't lose her cool and did was she could. It's a very nice restaurant with great tv's for a sporting event with decent food. Their staffing issues is the only thing holding it back."}
{"text":"When here once with my grandmother and the only thing I have to say about this place is that the last time we were here the prices were very high and they gave my grandmother very little wine for an expensive price, they claimed that they knew what the measurement of the glass was but they didn't give her enough wine for the price that she paid for, But then again the food is very great here, Might come back here at some point because they have karaoke nights here and I love the sing"}
{"text":"We really love the food at Buford's. In fact, we obsess over their burgers. They are so good. We have been to their Friday night karaoke as well a few times and it is a great time! And packed! 

So here's the bad. I hate to complain because we love Buford's burgers and milkshakes, but the service needs some help. This Saturday we went around 2:30 for dinner. No host/hostess. We were seated at a booth in the bar area once a waiter saw us. The bartender is the waitress for the bar room. She was obviously frazzled due to having multiple tables, guests at the bar, and having to seat people that were standing and waiting for a hostess. Then my husband's bacon cheeseburger came with no cheese. He didn't complain though. Then things got really slow and very confusing with the service once we were done. I don't want to be negative about anyone there, but I do think they should hire a dedicated host/hostess at the bare minimum. Service was struggling. 

We are excited about the new patio! Just hope the service improves!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want to wait 3 hours for mediocre pizza and 60% of a \"penguins\" bar ignoring the Stanley cup final game"}
{"text":"I did not have a milkshake, which I heard are good.  But we had a lot of other things and, without exception, everything was poor quality or just awful."}
{"text":"This should really be a 2-star review, but I'm adding a star because our server was pretty nice, as well as patient with all of my questions. Aside from that, I had a few issues throughout our lunch. 

First, I noticed that many of the tables were still dirty from the night before (we arrived 15 minutes after they opened). I had to brush large pieces of food off of our table and seats, so that kind of made me wonder how clean the kitchen was. 

For our lunch, we ordered the pulled pork sandwich (which my husband said was just okay) and the fried green tomato grilled cheese (which was decent for a grilled cheese, but there was no real \"wow\" flavor to it and the tomato slice was so thin, I mostly noticed the breading). We both got a side of fries, but they initially brought me regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries that I ordered. They were also kind of lukewarm, so we just took them home to reheat later. We also got a side of Chile Spoon Bread, which I was told was like cornbread. It ended up being a tiny piece of cold, mushy bread pudding-like stuff. I expected it to be warm, but it definitely wasn't. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be? I definitely wasn't a fan. 

We also ordered two milkshakes to go, which was the part of the meal that really annoyed me because I hate feeling like I'm getting screwed over in any way. The shakes came out and they were the size of a small drink at McDonald's. Based on photos I saw on-line, as well as the $6 price, I expected them to be bigger and even mentioned this to the server. She admitted that you get a lot more when you have the shake in the restaurant. When you order it to go, they only have small plastic cups, so you basically get half the serving. Why wouldn't she have mentioned that when I asked if they do shakes to go? And if the shakes must be significantly smaller, shouldn't they also be cheaper?  Or can't they afford to buy one more larger size cup? The shakes didn't even much flavor, so that made it worse. They were supposed to be salted caramel pretzel, but tasted more like plain vanilla with a few chunks of pretzel in it. I could have spent less money on a shake or Blizzard at DQ and been much happier. 

Overall, I'd give the place one more chance since there aren't many places around my office, but I'll go in with low expectations and definitely won't be leaving with a shake."}
