{"text":"I waited 2 hours for sub-par sushi. I would not reccomend to anyone who has anything to do that day or the next. I'm sorry for the people who come here."}
{"text":"The staff are really friendly, the food come quickly and it's pretty tasty, the yam tempura roll is a must have"}
{"text":"I had the Korean spicy chicken as well as their avocado cucumber roll and both were delicious. The Korean dish was piping hot with very flavourful vegetables and chicken breast. The spice was the perfect amount. The rolls were extremely fresh as well. I would definitely recommend Roll and Thai."}
{"text":"They forgot to process our order and we never got our food. Went there with my friend during lunch break and someone comes to take our order. Half an hour later people who ordered after us are done eating  we find out the order had not even been processed... Never going there again."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because it's so close to the Humber campus, but oh my god, it was really bad. I ordered the Pad Thai and it came out DRIPPING in sauce. Like, i wanted to blot it with a napkin. And it did not taste close to your average Pad Thai sauce at all. I still have no idea what I ate. The sauce tasted so weird and there was ssooo much of it.

I paid for the meal, while i mentioned to the waitress that I could not take more than a few bites before giving up. I then had a change of heart about paying for such a bad, bad meal, that I asked for $5 back (I paid $10 for it and felt that was waaay too much considering how bad it was). 

The owner/manger? came out and seemingly tried to convince me that this kind of dish was normal... I can assure you that it is not. The dish was probably one of three meals in my life that i've ever had to send back. She seemed a little put off that I was asking for half of my money back and although she gave it to me, in reality, she should have been polite enough to give me all of my money back. In honesty, I shouldn't have even had to ask for it, as soon as i sent a full plate back, they should have offered. 

The staff seems nice there and the service was pleasant. Maybe I'd go back for the sushi. 

But if you're going to have \"Thai\" in your name, learn how to make the authentic dish and not smoother noodles in a seemingly sickly sweet soy sauce-like concoction. I still have the bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Overpriced and they never get the order right for take out. The sushi is ok but not great and if you say anything they laugh nervously at you"}
{"text":"This cute little restaurant opened just last week and I love it. I attend Humber so it's close to the school. They have chairs and tables to sit and eat. The prices are affordable for a student. 

I've ordered rolls and udon soup so far and it's really great. I love that there's a whole bunch of things on the menu and they will make some adjustments for you. For example, I like my cucumber rolls with the seaweed on the outside, instead of the rice on the outside (just a minor adjustment). They have udon stirfry but you can also order udon soup! 

It's owned by a nice Korean family. I'm going to try their Pad Thai next!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is under new management and the menu and some of the decor has changed. Came in for lunch today, August 16/17.

The owner is very friendly and made some wonderfully delicious rolls for us. One of the best suishi meals that I have ever had! Prices are competitive and washrooms are clean.

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"There is surprisingly not a lot of good sushi options down by the lake so this restaurant is surely welcomed. I've tried their Humber roll, which is a nice twist on a spicy salmon roll and other basic rolls like the dynamite roll. All were made quickly and tasted fresh. The restaurant is small, but pleasant. Prices were also very affordable. I can't wait to get their Thai and Korean menu items."}
{"text":"I thought this day couldn't get any more perfect. Lazed w bae until two, then it was cold, so we figured, why not check out the sushi place on the adjacent block? Expectations were moderate, but as we settled into our chairs, we both sensed that something was different, special, about this place. 

It began with the salad. It was sharp, it had us guessing. Ginger, certainly, but what was that undefinable element in the dressing? Turns out the proportions were what did it. It was crispy and crunchy and memorable. Meanwhile, the soup was subtle and perfectly balanced. No overwhelming sodium.

Yet, this did nothing to prepare us for the remarkably aesthetic entree that was presented to us for an absurdly affordable 13 dollars apiece. Garnished with a veritable sculpture of crispy sweet potato and tempura - bae had only to witness it before exclaiming in a thrilling falsetto: \"it's so pretty!\"

Not the climax of the meal, shockingly. That honour goes to the delightful hybrid of Japanese and Italian cuisine - the inimitable sushi pizza. We all know it, but we know it as a single unit. Delicious, yet predictable. What if I told you that the pizzas here segmented into four tantalizing individually crafted sections, topped generously with the freshest ingredients of your choice. 

We would be remiss not to mention the beverages. The banana soda, albeit not the restaurant's creation, leapt neatly over the barrier that has caused so many banana-based beverages to collapse: the unshakeable sense that one is consuming medication. Equally delicious was the Shirakiku Ramune drink. Bae's pronouncement: \"Mmmmm, it tastes like bubble gum!\" 

We have barely scratched the surface of the experience, but unfortunately, we have run out of words. Turn your GPS on and get to Roll & Thai pronto. And, as bae says, let the treasure hunt begin!"}
{"text":"They recently had a change of hands and the portions sizes are much smaller now for the maki and sushis. We orders a 3 person platter and to be honest it didn't fill the three of us like it us to. Just keep this in mind if you're order any maki or sushi orders! Quality still good just much smaller!"}
{"text":"Love their special roll set for lunch. The people are very welcoming and the service is really nice. The roll set comes with salad and miso soup. They have 9 different set to chose from. They also have take away service. Their level of craft is really admirable. Big thumps up."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! Got the small party platter that comes with sushi and rolls. Really good. We did take out and it didn't take too long for them to assemble in the afternoon. Restaurant looks clean and neat. Definitely would eat here again :)"}
{"text":"New kid on the block 

Atmosphere is friendly.

Service is good. 

Food is hit or miss. 
Had a roll it was yummy. The bulgolgi was delicious. Thai dishes were really bad. The sashimi was not fresh, thin and not up to standard but then it was really cheap. 

Price is cheap but you get what you pay for."}
