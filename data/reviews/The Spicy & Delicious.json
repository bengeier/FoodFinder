{"text":"New owner with great new menu, and also have BBQ dishes. if you are looking for real sechuan food, this place is a must go. you will be suprised HOW GOOD THE FOOD IS."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Friday.

While it's always a bit eerie to get into an empty restaurant, the atmosphere is inviting.
The server was a tad too close-mouthed, but made up for it with getting me a fork and a spoon without me having to ask (that's a pet peeve I had with Asian restaurants. Some actually are trying to make you feel bad about eating with a fork...).

The Business Lunch menu has few options, but then, for $7.50, it's quite adequate.

I had the Kong Pao Chicken. It's been a while since I ate a decent Kong Pao, and this one was very good.

A word of warning that has nothing to do with the actual restaurant, but with its location: If you're walking on Yonge St. West side, beware of idiot drivers who spray puddle-blackwater on pedestrians. A dude just 20 yards ahead of me got coated...

Oh, and under $20 it's cash only... Just so you know..."}
{"text":"I definitely didn't expect this place to offer much but I am amazingly surprised! This restaurant is right across the street from my house and I've been wanting to give it a try for quite some time. When we first entered, we were greeted warmly and provided with a Chinese and English menu. We were offered water right away so service is great! We ordered 3 dishes with rice for 2 people and the total was $30 after tax and tip with plenty of leftovers - definitely good value. The flavours were great and a nice change to all the Korean and Japanese food in the area. Will definitely come back but might try take out next time."}
{"text":"i have been to this restaurant a few times and it has been consistently good. It's a small restaurant (mostly take out business) with a few tables. Not the best ambience but food is enjoyable. I have tried hot & sour soup, chicken skewers, beef pancake rolls, spicy beef and eggplant dishes. All 4/5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Great spicy authentic Chinese food. Everything we've had had been great. Definitely get the crispy fried spicy beef, garlic crispy ribs and green onion pancake"}
{"text":"Solid Sichuan.  More good home cook than polished chef style.  Not the best, but certainly far from bad. 
The location though means I don't need to go to to Richmond Hill or Chinatown, so it's on my standard go-to list. 

Fair warning. Do not go here if you don't like spicy food, or are looking for chicken balls with plum sauce. 

They do have some items for those not familiar with the region's cuisine, but ordering these dishes is like ordering a burger at a soul food joint and being disappointed when it's not good.  Someone gave this place 1 star for making this error, and that's just cruel. 

Recommend Shui Zhu Yu, and Fu Qi Fei Pian."}
{"text":"Very very good restaurant.  Authentic home cooked meal that reminded me of my hometown in china! Service is also very good :) what more does one need for a good restaurant ? Good food + good service = returned businesses !!"}
{"text":"Great portion. Great Taste.  Can modify the level of spiciness, just tell the waiters. Very authentic.  Everything is great!"}
{"text":"They aren't the best sichuan in town.  But, they are reliable and \"closer\" to me and are well-priced.  We get takeout from them once every 1-2 weeks.  All the cold apps are spot on, with different flavours (not all just sichuan pepper and chili oil).  The chili oil fish \"shui zhu yu\" is solid (wish it were spicer though).  Their version of pork belly with preserve vegetables \"mei cai kou rou\" is pretty good.  I prefer the version at Maple Yip the most though."}
{"text":"Love the food here. It's authentic Chinese food and the taste is great! They definitely know how to cook like a Chinese. Price is very reasonable for its quality! I'll definitely come again next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"the menu wasn't very good, and the 3 items we had to choose were so expensive it came to $30. no dinner for 1 or 2 specials, and the portion size for the price paid was not worth it. we walked in hoping it was chinese food like the previous times we went to this location, and were quite disappointed.

We got the crispy fried spicy beef (9.99)
sweet & sour chicken (8.99)
and the shanghai fried noodles (7.99)

When we asked if they had chicken balls, we were told \"that they are cantonese, not chinese\".  

the sweet and sour chicken was good, but the crispy fried spicy beef was tons of dried red peppers, and hardly any beef.

Definitely will not be eating here again.

eta: the staff were not rude or anything, but we just were not expecting the items they had to choose from... spicy frog legs, chicken KNEES, etc? I guess we are too canadian to want to try strange things. (although i do like to try new things, but not when I am not expecting that type of menu)"}
{"text":"the food is ok, but the service is the worst I have ever experience in the Toronto Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"It's probably the best Chinese restaurant in Toronto I've ever been eaten. It's convenient location and reasonable price, super low key down to earth old fashion kinda restaurant. As a kid from Southern China, steam fish has always been my one true love but I never had any good steam fish in any restaurant in GTA ever since I moved to Canada 8 years ago until I had this bass. The fish was so fresh and cooked to perfection, melt in my mouth, not fishy at all, the sauce was not over powering the fish. Their bbq skewers were delish, I like that they don't over season everything so I really got to enjoy the meat."}
{"text":"This place was practically empty when I got there, so I wasn't sure if going was a good decision or not, but within 10-15 minutes, at least 3/4 of the restaurant was full. I think I was the only Caucasian person in the place, which to me, is a good sign that the food is good. 

The server brought me the menus and a pencil with a notepad and told me to write down my order. A bit weird, but I guess there's no misunderstanding the order that way. I ordered the lunch special of eggplant in garlic sauce with a side of spring rolls, as well as a beef pancake roll. The food was decent, but quite greasy, especially when I heated my leftovers for dinner later. 

Good value, although I was overcharged for the eggplant dish. The menu says $6.99 (plus $1 for spring rolls) for lunch specials but I was charged $9.99. I didn't realize until after I left the restaurant. Oh well. Still a good value for the portion size. Service was typical for this type of restaurant - they take your order and bring the food but don't seem to actually care if you enjoy it or not, because the server doesn't come back until you flag her down for the bill."}
{"text":"Spicy and delicious is a great description of this place. Cozy, with quiet but upbeat music on the background and a wonderful fusion of Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I am shocked that this place hasn't closed down..  Came on a friday 3pm lunch to get the lunch special..  As i enter its pretty clear that space is completely empty.  I get moderately greeted as expected for a asian restaurant.  I purchased their black bean sauce chicken and total comes up just above 10$.  You have to add a dollar if you want a drink. I got my food relatively early. Upon getting home and opening up my food i now realize ive been robbed of my money.  Portion is TERRIBLE not even worth 5 bucks id say. 

Taste is very mediocre..  Ive been to many chinese restaurants and i can honestly say this one is by far the WORST avoid this place at all cost"}
{"text":"I came here as I was craving spicy chinese food for lunch. The lunch price that many have reported is no longer correct- lunch special is now $8.99 + $1 for springroll. I don't think the price is that great for what it is. I ordered General Tso's Chicken - it basically tasted the same as some food court places such as Manchu Wok. There was also not a lot of chicken but a lot of onions and peppers. It came with a salad. I think next time I will walk north of Sheppard for spicy Chinese places."}
{"text":"Their \"water cooked fish\" was the best I ever had! My girlfriend confirmed that it is how it should be made :D (she's originally from that region of China). This was the star of the show. Balanced taste, generous portion, and beautiful presentation.

We also had a cold chicken dish with sesame paste, hot and sour soup with potato vermicelli, lamb skewers, and a hot/sour meat and bamboo sprouts dish. These dishes were well executed; I enjoyed the food here. However, as these dishes did not exceed my expectations of a \"solid\" restaurant, I would not say they are particularly memorable (I am still excited about the fish!).

With the exception of their BBQ menu (i.e. skewers, etc.), the menu(s) was in simplified Chinese, which makes ordering a bit inaccessible. They do have photos for their popular dishes, so you can order with your finger as well. Regardless, I saw non-Chinese folk here (including a Caucasian female with her son) and I think they were welcomed. 

The prices are not the most affordable, but I think they are more than fair. Their central location is also really convenient. You wouldn't think to eat there since they are located between 401 and Sheppard on Yonge (most people get off the highway then start thinking of food Sheppard onwards), but make sure you check out this hidden gem. There's also a bar upstairs for after, if you're looking for somewhere to continue the night - I haven't been there though, so don't blame me if it's not to your liking!"}
{"text":"I feel like I just burn a hole in my stomach after eating at The Spicy & Delicious!

The items with the 2 chili on the side in the menu are quite spicy..and over all what we ordered were quite delicious?!

Now business hour is till 10 pm so when we arrived at 9:40 pm on a Sunday, we were in a rush to order so the kitchen can clean up and ready to close for the night.

We shared:
House Special Spicy Chicken ($7.50)
- Love all those fresh green and red pepper, not only made the dish spicy but add really nice colour to the dish and of course those little devilish szechuan peppercorn that will numb your tongue!
- chicken was cooked really tender and have a hint of wine, garlic and soy sauce

Deep Fried Chicken Soft Bone in a Basket ($12.50)
- Battered and deep fried chicken knee cartilage has a great bite
- great beer food!

Hot and Sour Potato Noodle Soup ($4.50)
- the broth is so spicy... and so garlicky
- I always love potato noodle as I love that chewiness in it

I ended up packing some leftover for lunch.. and the food still taste great the morning after!

Just wish the restaurant serves some cheap beers, these spicy food just go so well with a iced cold refreshing beer!

BTW, I wonder why my Yelp friend kept sticking his tongue out while eating with me?"}
{"text":"Ambiance = *; Service = *; Spicy Popcorn Chicken = *****... Food makes up for anything, but I'll get takeout next time I think"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot. I got Shanghai noodles, spicy popcorn chicken, hot and sour soup and beef pancake roll. Everything was pretty good, especially the spicy popcorn chicken which had great flavour and spice. Soup and noodles weren't as spicy as I would have liked but still tasty. Overall pretty impressed with this little restaurant, nothing fancy but decent food."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I crave spicy chinese food. If you live in the neighbourhood and like szechuan, come check it out. They have underground parking at the back. They make a mean chili fish pot and their spicy popcorn chicken is amazing. I always ask for extra spicy :) Their prices are a bit on the pricier side but its worth it to satisfy the cravings."}
