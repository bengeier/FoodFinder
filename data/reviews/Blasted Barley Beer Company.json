{"text":"Had a horrible first experience at this place (during lunch) and thought I'd never be back, but since that was during their opening week, I thought I'd try it out one more time. Have been back twice since (both times at night) and have actually had a nice time. The ambiance is really warm and inviting, the music choice is pretty great and the bartenders are knowledgeable and attentive. I'm glad I decided to give this place another shot"}
{"text":"Been here twice. 1st time, the servers weren't serving. They were huddling chatting. Won't go into a diatribe on n it. Improve on interacting and making your community feel more a part of your organization dn bring thwm what they ordered.

Second trip was a Sunday morning. Excellent live reggae, slightly more attentive service, there was a light volume of patrons in the establishment, so that may have helped.

With a tuning on the wait staff, this place is going to be amazong. Excellent handles with great selections from around the U.S. 

Keep up the growth guys."}
{"text":"Awesome food! 

Great environment! 

Prices are a steal for the quality of food! 

Great options and theme on the menu! 

Service is top notch and always on top of making sure you're doing okay.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service was incredible slow took over an hr to receive our meal. Once the food came out it was mediocre at best. I say skip this place and just hit up places like 4 peaks if you bar food and beer."}
{"text":"Returned back to my home away from home Tempe for another Convention, I stopped by my favorite brewery and once again I was amazed by the beer selection.  The food as always was on point, played a few games.  The staff as always was very alert and helpful.  Just the fun loving atmosphere always makes this place top notch. If I could I would do 10 stars."}
{"text":"Rob McKenzie is our absolute favorite! He is literally the most accommodating, hands-on manager I've had help me at any restaurant/bar. Ask for Shay behind the bar! Every Sunday she's here taking care of us with her witty banter and speedy service. Despite the big groups we've brought in on a number of occasion, service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Our trip got off to a slow start, as we were seated and then waited for an extended period of time to order. However, after speaking to the hostess, we were quickly attended to with wonderful service. And to top it off, the food was amazing! If I'm ever back in town, I will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"This bar converts to a club on the weekends after 10pm and is one of my favorite spots to take folks new to clubbing. The music selection varies from top 40 to old school rap. There's a comfortable place in the back where you can sit and sip a drink while you feel out the crowd. Lovely gogo dancers are standing on two counters that are cleared for them to dance. Tips are encouraged. :3 decent prices, fun and not terribly crowded."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing, great staff, great food and drinks. Good place to chill have a beer and play some games!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and the staff were friendly the beer was good. Wings were pretty tasty. . Mondays are half off pitchers and wings plus a quiz so it made for a fun night out around. I Will be back to here for more."}
{"text":"First time yesterday and it was fun. Cool bartender, great wings, good beer selection. What's awesome is there's a $3 grab bag mystery beer and that's a lot of fun. I got lucky and got a santan craft beer but good luck with getting the old style or PBR. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Honestly the menu here is so deceiving. Do not look at the menu online because it isn't true. They make it seem like it's only $11 for a mimosa pitcher and then one cent for a refill after that but that isn't the case. The manager will come over and make it seem like he's fixing the issue but he is still charging you far more than you thought you were going to pay. It also took forever (over an hour)  to get sat even though they made it seem like it would only take about 20 minutes or less. Absolutely terrible service here. Do not trust the staff, they're only here to make money and do not care about the customers. They made it seem like it was our fault and trying to take advantage of a deal which we were not."}
{"text":"Sam is the absolute best bartender ever! They were super slammed on a Sunday afternoon and it was such a good experience. Not only did our food come out quickly (shout out to the biscuits and gravy  OMG so good) but Sam was super attentive and an absolute joy. 13/10 for Sam!"}
{"text":"You may stop at this place for the beer or the live music or the great staff BUT do the planet a favor and try the \"Superhuman Bowl\".  It is so delicious and stuffed with so many superfoods that I am convinced if the right person ate this thing every day for a week they would come up with the cure for cancer! Could that person be you?? Love this place!"}
{"text":"great food and atmosphere. Not to mention their own Brew!"}
{"text":"Went here during happy hour, and there is a nice list of craft beers to choose from. The menu had some strange items that I would not expect to see at a bar. It's almost like they are trying to cater to foodies who like to try new things, which could be a hit or a miss. Much of the items  include pork, which is not great if you're not a pork fan. The food selection could definitely be bigger. The server we had was sort of rude, but the bartender who handed us our drinks was very friendly and professional.  I think overall there are better places to stop by on Mill."}
{"text":"Went for St Patricks day to watch basketball and have dinner and a few drinks. The food was decent, but not worth going back for. After receiving the bill and realizing that we were charged full price for our drinks, I mentioned the mistake to our server. She informed me that there was no happy hour today due to St Patricks day. The menus we received made no mention of this and specifically showed happy hour until 7 PM. Don't advertise something and then say something else to your customers. There are other choices on Mill Avenue, and I recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Their portions are a joke, and very over priced.  Beer was good.  Won't live long on mill."}
{"text":"Delicious gastropub food and a great atmosphere!

We had the cheese sticks and wings to start. The cheese sticks were giant and clearly house-made! Most amazing cheese sticks I have ever enjoyed! The wings were good - and very spicy! I ordered Mac and cheese ( minus the pork belly that comes standard), which was cheesy and thick... Very good.

We also ordered drinks that were very tasty!"}
{"text":"I have only been to their brunch hour on Sunday's. My mother actually loves driving from the West Valley to this place. 

They have a $10 bottomless mimosa deal, and $5 Bloody Mary's. If you're hungover the next day and believe only halfly in the \"hair of the dog\" mentality, you can buy an individual mimosa for $5. There is never anyone there, so the wait staff is always super friendly, attentive, and makes sure we are full of mimosa!

Their brunch is pretty stinking good. Their chicken and waffles plate isn't Lolo's style, but it's still pretty tasty. Their eggs Benedict always hits the spot, and their $5 (maybe $6) biscuit and gravy \"side\" is actually a monstrous plate of 4 biscuits, and their biscuits are not bad at all.

This place really is a gem on Mill. I don't know what would make it 5-stars, something to separate it from other brunches? Maybe a mimosa or Bloody Mary bar? When it's nice enough I look forward to playing bags on the outside patio."}
{"text":"Great place to gorge of some really decadent food with a couple of the great beers on tap. The happy hour is a must on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Sunday Funday.... this place is the bomb! Ask for Shay or Emily..... they're the best! Good food and creative drinks."}
{"text":"Good Day Yelpers! 
Stay away from this mediocre service from managers and bartenders. 

This one is for you Rob MacKenzie (manager)

I arrived at Blasted Barley at 11 AM on a Saturday. I was more than excited to enjoy the bottomless mimosas, and I was extremely satisfied with the chicken and waffles. If I ever found my way back to Tempe, I'd consider ordering from this place to-go. 

By 3PM my friends I ordered in excess of $200.00 to congratulate my recent graduate of a friend and his girlfriend, with a bill of food plus excessive alcohol. The bartenders dream right? 

Now I'm more than happy to tip any bartender, any waitress, I've dated several and I understand where they make their money. 

But this review is targeted at their manager 
Rob MacKenzie. 

When it came time to pay my tab I found I was paying $12/shot of grey goose(5 total) and $2/red bull. I asked the bartender why am I paying for 5 red bulls I did not consume individually?

The manager Rob MacKenzie came over and said that's how it is, you pay for the red bull with each red bull vodka. 

I replied I understand that logic, however why am I paying for the majority of a red bull and I don't get the left over red bull? I continued by saying in the future, based off of my experience with the Capitol of Nightlife (Los Angeles) being my hometown, you should consider changing it to be more reasonable because that's silly. 

He flat out insulted me in front of three employees and two of my friends and said \"Yeah there's no way that's going to happen\"

I decided, the only way to send a message to management, was to punish their daily voice of opinion. And 0 their tip on the bartender. Now mind you, this bar tender barely started her shift. She didn't deserve the $40.00 tip I intended on giving her. Rob MacKenzie ruined that for her. 

Rob MacKenzie needs to learn customer service, he knows nothing of that skill. Nor does the bartender girl (the new one) who thought it would be acceptable to shout at me as I walked out the bar."}
{"text":"I loved blasted for months! The management is the shit and the people are so cool but I honestly cannot stand the fact that when I come every weekend on Sunday, EVERY TIME, on of my guests can't have something on the menu due to not having anymore of it or the menu being condensed even more than we have grown accustom to, it saddens me that I will have to find a new breakfast spot just so I can get eggs Benedict lmao who doesn't serve that everyday!? I'm bummed man, stop changing something that isn't broke!!!"}
{"text":"Met the head chef Shane or Forrest, whatever his name was. You would think he walked on water the way he treated you. Great music, cheap drinks, but don't expect much else."}
{"text":"The shrimp salad was so good I had to have it both nights I stayed at the Embassy Suites. Brian is the best bartender in town!"}
{"text":"Personable service on the patio on a Sunday funday double date.  We light railed it from central Phoenix and walked just a few paces to this spot previously the tavern on mill.

We shared nachos (do it) and I did the Delish margarita mule happiness.  Actual fresh lime- woah that's rare!

They were out of quite a few beers and the flight did not come labeled so it was a blind tasting pretty much."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST place ever. Especially weekend brunch. But anytime.. awesome. Food and their beers too."}
{"text":"Some things went wrong when we were in dining and management was quick to resolve. My Thai Bowl salad was to die for. And service was friendly! Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is afraid to do business on Sundays. They only offer the brunch menu from open to 3pm. Other than that you can order wings, burgers or fries at noon to 3pm.  Nothing else! Therefore, everyone in the place is only drinking beer and not ordering food, while if the whole menu was available, everyone would have a plate. 
      With that aside, beer selection is good and service is fine, because the servers and bar tenders aren't busy because no one in ordering. Hey management, wise up!"}
{"text":"Super friendly servers and bartenders! Attended an event with heavy hosted appetizers in their back patio. Beautiful night in Tempe, we didn't want to leave!  The wings were great. Would love to come back and try their sweet potato waffle with a turkey leg!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and good vibes are how to make a place great. Sam did great making this place a wonderful place to enjoy the game"}
{"text":"It's become something of a tradition for us to stop in at Blasted Barley when coming to Tempe to enjoy the Ironman competition. It's enough out of the way from the main hubbub to not be too crowded while still having a good vibe. The back patio has a bit of a secluded feel, though it's not really). The staff is typically friendly, college age and pretty good at keeping up with your table, though some times it can take a bit to get their attention if looking for a refill. 

Jim and I opted this time for the Chicken Mole Omelette, served with nicely cut fresh potatoes and a tasty biscuit. Twyla chose the Huevos Rancheros, which she gave a nice thumbs - up to. Occasionally they will offer Bottomless Mimosas, but not today; though we still enjoyed several pitchers which were reasonably priced and split between the three of us were nice and tasty. 

Blasted Barley is a good place to catch a bit of tasty fare, hang out on the patio and enjoy the company of good friends. It's not a high end type of place, just a good spot to spend time once in a while, grab your drink of choice and enjoy the Downtown Tempe atmosphere."}
{"text":"Number one: Great beer! Thai chicken salad was refreshingly light and nutty. The ambiance was nice with dark wood bar and nice cool summer retreat from the outside heat. Will go back again. While I hope they turn down the volume of the streamed music, it was not an overly hipster crowd."}
{"text":"To be honest have not been to Mill since my ASU graduation 5 years ago.  Sunday Brunch, friendly staff and so attentive, great omelette (I am so picky about my eggs) biscuit was dry and older but whatever, potatoes average.  Bottomless mimosas and they are on top of their refills! Great staff !"}
{"text":"Good drinks and good food. They have a few vegetarian options and other items are easily modifiable"}
{"text":"I've come to Blasted Barley multiple times for both brunch and happy hour. Their brunch is great, it lasts till 3pm and you can get bottomless mimosas for $10 if you order food, or $15 if you don' t. I have tried their chicken and waffles and the resurrection for brunch and the resurrection might be one of my favorite dishes ever. For happy hour I tried their popcorn which lacked some seasoning, but the pork belly was delicious. The happy hour drink menu is lacking and only consists of a few beers nothing really additional. Honestly the 5 star rating mainly pertains to brunch since everything is delicious! Definitely a top stop for Sunday funday."}
{"text":"disappointing experience. The place the was dead and I guess they're training new kitchen staff. I went for the beers and thought I'd try the food. The bread was hard as a rock and it never should've left the kitchen. The pesto pasta had no flavor and was dry. Good beer selection though which is what drew me here."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my brother and we both really enjoyed our selves. I got the chilaquiles and they were delicious, surprisingly sweet so I wish I had some salt but still tasty. My brother got this french toast special that was by far outstanding. Everyone was friendly and $10 bottomless mimosas is a steal. I'm excited to come back!"}
{"text":"Never had a manager of an establishment treat loyal customers so poorly... Will not be returning again"}
{"text":"If you go in expecting this place to be a college-kid focused beer joint with some food on the side, you probably won't be disappointed.

The food is mediocre at best, I had a small IPA Chicken (very small) that was supposedly brined yet still dry as the desert. Another in our group had the Thai Chicken Bowl complete with still-frozen chicken. 

I ordered the Gin Blossom, which seemed promising, but was made by amateur bartenders painstakingly following a recipe, heavy on the peach schnapps. $10 for a glass I left on the table 3/4 full. 

The beer seemed decent, alright selection of local and not-local options. The problem is we already have several of those spots on Mill and I'm not really sure what this place adds to the area, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Took my family to Blasted Barley and was far from disappointed.  It was super cute and in a great atmosphere.  The location was great and easily accessible.  We did not have to wait a single minute for a table and was greeted by our waitress in under a minute.

The food was phenomenal as well as the drinks.  The employees were nothing short of outstanding and made the experience 100 times better.  Definitely a spot to stop by if in town!"}
{"text":"All around fantastic spot to enjoy beer, relax on their patio, and eat food on Father's day. 

When we were there it was pretty chill and the environment was made better by the live music from a guy playing top 40 hits on acoustic guitar. He used his loop pedal to make it sound like a full band. We really enjoyed listening to him. 

Onto the beer. Our waiter, Zach, was really helpful for recommending beers and offering his insight. I had the bro easy, which was their take on a coors or golden lager kind of deal. It was one of the better craft versions of A-B styles I've had. If you'd like to stick to craft beers from some of your other favorites, you can choose from the others they had for guest taps such as lagunitas, dragoon, etc. Lots of Arizona beer which was cool to see in addition to their own. 

Top it off with a fantastic salad that measured up to the previous reviews and photos, and this was a really awesome experience."}
{"text":"Beers were great..but it took 35 minutes to get a club sandwich and a caprese sandwich.  There were only 6 customers in the brewery..so there shouldn't have been a wait."}
{"text":"This is in such a good location and I was excited to check it out. Went with a big group and the wait staff handled it wonderfully. They had a pretty good beer selection with a couple local brews which is a major plus. I wasn't too impressed with the menu. I'm not sure if I think they're trying too be too fancy or what the deal was. I got the Monte Christo sliders made with pork belly and it was just meh. Didn't care for the dipping sauce. My friend had the pork belly mac and cheese and she liked it. Lots of outdoor seating which is really nice especially with the heaters :) overall I'd say good for drinks not for food."}
{"text":"My love treated me to lunch after he noticed I was faint with hunger. Blasted Barley was unexpectedly delicious. I had the Popcorn of Sustainability that has bacon and smoked pork belly, and the Quinoa Chop salad. Just all around delicious and sinful at the same time. I washed it all down with a wonderful Sororan White Chocolate beer. Yum. Executive Chef Jason Shaw takes bar food to another level. The atmophere is very hip and open. Great spot for after work drinks and bites to eat. Can't wait to try the Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"Some of the best customer service we've ever had on mill!  It was pouring outside and they were really nice about accommodating a table inside for us. We were there for probably a total of five hours to watch football. They had all the major games on. Our waitress was super cute and attentive- i can't remember her name but she was from Ireland!  The brunch was delicious and we always had a pitcher of the bottomless mimosas on our table. Definitely coming back here for brunch."}
{"text":"I used to love this place until yesterday. I had a big group come for my birthday brunch and it turned out to be a terrible experience. First of all, our waiter attempted to memorize our orders and then came back two times because he couldn't remember everything. Our friend is allergic to egg yolk and he told her they would not accommodate her by doing egg whites. She said okay well the only other option on this menu is the chicken and waffles unless you let me order something off the lunch menu. He said oh we're out of that...she spoke to the manager and he said they had chicken and waffles so he doesn't know why the waiter said that. The waiter also didn't put our other friend's order in...and kept saying it was \"coming\". Also, the chilaquiles are literally just nachos and cheese with an egg-don't get! Chicken and waffles were amazing after all the hassle. We also went there specifically for the bottomless mimosas-apparently they wouldn't do the deal because of Pat's Run and the UFC fight.....there was barely anyone there! Fine to go for just drinks, but would not recommend for eating."}
{"text":"You advertised being a great place to watch the fight but the moment the last punch is thrown, there's no more sound....suddenly there's DJ blowing up my ears....fuck that! I want to here Joe Rogan and the interviews but no....Instead I get super loud house and dance music in my ear....."}
{"text":"Sarah, the red head, was a great bartender! She was so sweet and helped us finish our scavenger hunt! Thanks for taking great care of us Sarah! We will for sure be back because of her."}
{"text":"Overall I had a positive experience here; I'd go back, but I'm not in a hurry. The best part about Blasted Barley is the big, comfortable outdoor areas. Service was attentive on a slow Thursday evening. Food was hit and miss. A friend and I enjoyed the buffalo wings (on happy hour price); they're large and tender, with lots of sauce. Next time I'll know to ask for extra ranch. The curry cauliflower sliders are, in a word, awful. They're not sliders, I didn't detect any real curry, and they just weren't enjoyable to eat. The lettuce was dry and seemed more like the sort of thing that should be used as a garnish. Oh well. On the plus side, my friend seemed to enjoy his rather large chop salad. The beer, also, was hit and miss. The Strawberry Bottle Rocket was good; it's a cream ale, and true to the style the texture is very creamy; it's easy to drink. The subtle strawberry flavor seems natural, not forced, and is not overwhelming, as I've found with some fruit beers. This is not my style of beer at all, but I'd have it again. (I gave it a positive review on Ratebeer.) That said, I couldn't make heads or tales of the Bang Bang Black IPA; it's watery, thin, and neither hoppy like an IPA nor malty (or roasted) like the \"black\" would suggest. There was nothing \"bang bang\" about it. And it comes in a smaller glass (probably because of the slightly higher ABV). Oh well. They do have an impressive list of beers and appear to have a full bar, so there are plenty of options. Happy hour seems to have good pricing (from 3-7)."}
{"text":"Huge improvement from The Tavern! Really solid menu of upscale bar food and a very nice selection of beers, including some really interesting house brews. Very friendly and attentive staff as well! The patio is awesome"}
{"text":"My second bad experience with a Tempe business. We arrived for a beer and were told by the hostess at the door that there were no servers working that day. huh? Anyway, we went in to the bar and it was obvious that they were having a serious problem. Very hectic, unorganized atmosphere. Dirty dishes and glasses piled on the bar. The \"clean\" glasses they were using for service were not clean. Gross. Place was dirty, loud and chaotic. I went down the street and got a smoothie while my party had beers, I just couldn't stand the atmosphere, dirt, and noise. I don't like judging too harshly when a business is having an obvious problem but it was pretty bad and had completely gotten out of their control, so it was a real bummer."}
{"text":"The renovations that were made to the old Tavern on Mill are phenomenal! The place is beautiful. There are lots of interesting little details everywhere, from the mural of the old Mill, to the ice cold keg room right above the bar! The brewery equipment is really cool and out in plain sight. The menu is unique yet familiar, with a good deal of it made in house. Many of the ingredients in the specialty cocktails are also made in house. And the beers..O THE BEERS!!! A fantastic selection from lights to stouts.
The Orange Bomb is an orange chocolate stout that's very appealing, it's not too thick and has more of a citrus bite and a subtle chocolate tone that makes it very drinkable, unlike most stouts that are heavy and leave me feeling sleepy! All in all, the atmosphere,
delicious food, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and upscale beer and cocktail list make this the best place to be on mill!! Love it."}
{"text":"This is a review for BB's nightlife. I came here to close out my night of bar hopping on Mill. I can't say much pro or con about the place. As it has been in the past - it has a nice back outside patio with comfortable chairs. It wasn't crowded so you could sit anywhere. Met some cool people back there too. Only had one drink there so I can't really comment on the food or drink prices."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for bottomless mimosas and brunch on sunday. I've had terrific service every single time I've been here and the food is always amazing!  If you have the option try to get Izzy as your waitress becaise she makes every time we come here a fun experience!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I am obsessed with sours and they have a bunch! Fate struck when it was a Sunday and we walked by and saw the sign sour Sunday! $2 off sours-Heck ya. Bartender was so kind and helpful. Aesthetically pleasing. I would say great for date night. They have a basketball game and bags outside. They are open late even in Sundays. They have food? I didn't try any, nor did I look. I was happy we saw this place right off Mill."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places on mill! I frequently go to brewery's in the area and they have a wide range of local craft beer including their own house brews which is greatly appreciated. Me and my boyfriend shared the good life burger with tots which was outstanding. And as always, expect friendly service. Coming back soon!"}
{"text":"If you're craving Mac n Cheese this is definitely a place to check out! I had their jalapeño and bacon Mac n cheese and it was delicious!!!! I'll definitely be going back for some mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"we got sat and waited 20
minutes for three waitresses to look at us but not come up to us. not the first time this has happened ! so we left and went to salut kitchen which is soooo much better and has bottomless mimosas too"}
{"text":"Funky brew pub, eclectic menu, great beer selection. Had the Huss the Hustler porter and hangover burger. The boozy cereal would be a great way to start your day."}
{"text":"Blasted Barley welcomed our big group. This place has all the right stuff. A big selection of beers and cocktails. They even have vodka infused Capri Suns. Bringing the child and an adult in me to the surface."}
{"text":"Went there during happy hour on a weekday. We sat in the back patio area to watch a band play in the courtyard. The waiter was very prompt in getting us water and to talk about our choices of beers. He even brought us samples. I noticed that when our food and drinks came it was from different people and not the original waiter that stopped at our table. He only took our orders. We ordered wine and it actually took us half an hour to get that drink and I had to go talk to him about where our drinks. We kept saying they were coming. The whole time we sat and watched him as he stood in front of the register and not going to get our drinks. We were just about going to cancel them after about a half an hour waiting when another person who hadn't taken our order came with our drinks."}
{"text":"Dog friendly, all you can drink mimosas for a very decent price and the live music on Sundays is actually a pleasure to listen to."}
{"text":"The cauliflower sliders were super good!! The chicken and waffle were good too. Nothing  truly mind blowing but it was good and I would come back. The set up of the bar is really nice. Wanted to watch the seahawks and  the tvs were nice and close to the bar."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Jake seems like a nice bartender as he was friendly. The place looks the same since it changed names. The food menu has taken a hit though as salads are dominant and it just seems like nothing creative was being served on the small menu. I had a Cherry Vanilla porter, but they also have six of their own beers on tap. They didn't have this many beer choices when I went to school, but I guess ASU kids don't drink Milwaukee's best."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times, the service isn't perfect, but they always get my order in. The cheese sticks are my favorite! Love them! They were thinner this visit than the last time I had them. I liked them more when they were thicker. But they are still amazing. Good beer, good music, good volume level. I would recommend this place to anyone and will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place. We went for drinks and an appetizer and we're really satisfied. Good tap selection, decent nachos, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Appetizers and beer at happy hour.  The Popcorn of Sustainability couldn't hold a candle to the Curry Cauliflower Sliders.  The popcorn was just delicious bacon and pork belly on top of plain old popcorn with dried out Parmesan shreds and needed more sage seasoning.  The Curry Cauliflower sliders were sweet curry flavored onions and bell peppers on top of al dente cauliflower slices - which seemed like a more completely thought-out appetizer. 

I had a blood orange IPA but the hoppiness overwhelmed any blood orange flavor.  I then had a dunkleweiss and sample a lager that had a distinct lemon note.  All the beers were clean but lacked precision and focus of flavor. Still, they were enjoyable."}
{"text":"Surprisingly a good lunch. Food is solid. They also had a live band playing acoustic jams. 

I had a apple burger with fries and roasted vegetables. Burger was good, however I ordered it medium well and it was well done. Vegetable were cooked perfectly :) 


Jon had a good life burger with blue cheese and Brie, we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best weekend brunch atmospheres on mill. They have a large patio and outdoor bar seating!

I came for St. Patrick's day and they had their green house beer and $5 Bloody Marys. I've also been here for their penny mimosas! For $15 you can get unlimited mimosas for a penny each. 

They do have some of their own brews, which aren't the best I've tried but it's always fun to try a new brew. 

Their food looked great! Although I didn't eat, their breakfast and lunch food smelled really good!"}
{"text":"Great staff, very attentive and helpful. The new food they added to the menu is amazing! Can't beat the 15$ bottomless mimosas, and the new breakfast tacos on Saturday/Sunday."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today and we were seated in the back patio which should have been the first sign the service was going to be terrible. Sat down two hours before spring training game and let our waiter know but that didn't help either. Service was slow for drinks and food. I ordered a lettuce wrapped burger and it came out with one soggy piece of romaine some tomato slices and the patty. That's it, no toppings no cheese. We were in such a hurry that we could send it back. When the manager came out (Thompson) he just had excuses and only gave 20% off the bill to try and help but by that point it didn't make up for the shitty service and shitty food and us being late to the game. Would never come here again."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! Wonderful bar in downtown Tempe. Staff was super helpful and knowledgeable especially Tiffany! I came on taco Tuesday. I promise you can not go wrong with any of their tacos! Growler was free with Blasted Barley fill! The You Can Do It beer was amazing! Hint of cranberry dunkel!!"}
{"text":"I will gladly update my review once I get to try the dish i really wanted to try which was their Turkey and waffles.  I tried ordering it for lunch, they placed my order only to have to come back 15 min later and tell me it's not ready - still cooking. Talk about disappointment.

Ended up getting their Pork belly mac 'n cheese, which who can say not to pork belly? but the portions were small, especially for the price. and to be fair - I'm a petite person, so I was almost full, but not quite - which maybe given our obesity epidemic, is a good thing - but still, give me my American portions please! If I want tiny portions I'll eat at a French restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is whack. Took an hour+ to receive a burnt waffle, the entire thing was black and the chef tried to hide it by putting both burnt/charred sides on the inside of the chicken waffle sandwich. There was no ketchup either in the whole place, limiting my friends fry experience. There was also no syrup and they refused to tell us that until after we waited over an hour for the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal, at least from a food stand-point. Being from North Carolina, I find it difficult to find good BBQ. Surprisingly, I had to concede that their  BBQ pork sandwich was pretty darn good. They had an incredible list of beers on tap, so much so that I had no clue what to order.  I was allowed to try any beer that interested me to make the best decision for my meal (I decided on a darker, Huss Rice Pudding).  By far the best though, was the Pork Belly Mac n' Cheese. The seasoned flavors burst in my mouth and the crunchy housemade chips are the perfect compliment for the cheesy deliciousness. 

Now, on to the atmosphere: Inside seating was a bit dim, and the music was present but not overpowering by any means. To dispel the dim lighting, they kept both the front and back doors open, where there existed seating outside as well.  In the front is covered tables with large comfortable benches, and in the back is a firepit with tables scattered throughout and couches that just make you want to sink into them. Both locations made me almost wish I had sat outside!

All in all, this place, as a lunch or dinner venue, was fantastic. Everyone was friendly, the food was unbelievably tasty, and the ambiance was beyond pleasant. Have no doubt,I I will be returning here often."}
{"text":"I've been here at night and during the day. Their Friday night party with DJ Thomas James really knows how to throw a party with music to fit any crowd. I found the food to be a little salty and greasy but the home beer Red, White and Boom was a great choice. The place has a great layout and fun games in the back!"}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch and football! Our gal Cassie was great and kept the mimosas coming. However, only flaw was that the mimosas were kind of warm. We kept having to add ice. Other than great, great atmosphere and good food!"}
{"text":"Wait for a table wasn't bad for a Sunday brunch on Mill. Waited 20 minutes for a waiter before asking for someone to stop by at the bar. Had the chicken and waffles was served cold and soggy. Great place to come at night not for brunch."}
{"text":"Their happy hour menu was fantastic! I got the curry \"sliders\" and a beer for under $8.00. The curry sliders were doused in sauce and served on a bed of fresh lettuce. I did not read the menu well enough because I was expecting these to come on buns over a bed of lettuce. It was too hard to eat them as lettuce cups and I ended up getting my hands extremely sticky. 

Do: try the curry sliders
Don't: use your hands! 

Lesson learned from Messy Morgan. 

I enjoyed their beer list but the majority weren't on happy hour so I was limited. I tried their Oat IPA and it was great. I wish I had ordered the Rye IPA however, it's much better!"}
{"text":"Matt Thomas is a connoisseur. It was my 21st, I've been test tequilas all night long and he's the only one who recommended me something different than the average. The vibe is chill and the man is a genius . If you want good times and experience; check out the blasted brewery!"}
{"text":"This is my second trip to the Blasted Barley. We Ubered there for my birthday brunch and had a fine time :-). We ordered Blasted Popcorn and bottomless mimosas to start. Our waitress was great and brought plentiful refills. There was a guy playing some tunes on the guitar, it was a little quiet which was both good and bad. Good: the music was not intrusive, Bad: we couldn't really hear the artist sing. 
Our brunch dishes were good. I had been here before and got the Mole omelet, this time I got the 'Moco Loco' it was fine but I really enjoyed the Mole omelet before. I chalk this difference up to just enjoying one of two different dishes more and not anything nefarious. 

For the most part The Blasted Barley is a good time and a great place for a group meal. The menu is broad enough to appease everyone and Bottomless Mimosas at A+. Not for every weekend but good for an eclectic group, we will surely come again!"}
{"text":"Went to Blasted Barley on a Friday night at 7:30 pm. The service and beer were good, and while the food was creative, it lacked in its execution. 
     Our server, Juliet, was helpful by providing beer samples, discussing beer specials, and suggesting modifications to menu items, such as having the mustard sauce for the chicken and waffle sandwich on the side. 
    My friends tried two beer: one prickly pear flavored and the other milk and honey flavored. They both enjoyed their drinks. 
     My friends and I ordered wings, the curry cauliflower sliders, the ramen burger, the apple burger, and the chicken and waffle sandwich. My friends enjoyed the wings, and Juliet remembered all the extra sauces they requested. The chicken and waffle sandwich was also delightful, although a bit sticky from the syrup it comes with. The meat of both burgers was well-cooked, although the apple slices were so thin on the apple burger that I could not taste them, and the ramen burger seemed a bit confused as a concept - there was not much Asian flavor or spice to it besides the noodles.
     I was disappointed with the curry cauliflower sliders. I saw another reviewer (Morgan T.) post a picture of the appetizer when she ordered it, and it looks delightful in the picture. When I ordered it, the cauliflower seemed hastily cooked and assembled: there were no delightful char marks on the cauliflower like in Morgan T.'s picture and the lettuce, seeming to wilt from the heat of the cauliflower, was not adequate to contain the roasted red peppers and caramelized onions. The dish was wet, lacked flavor, and was not worth the price. 
     I would recommend Blasted Barley for the excellent drinks and chicken and waffle sandwich. Our server Juliet was a delight. While there are a lot of neat food ideas on the menu, the details of the dishes were lacking. I imagine the kitchen was just having a rough night, and I hope to have a chance to check out Blasted Barley again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go on dates with my boyfriend or to hang out with a group of friends during the day! The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the drinks are plentiful! I have all good things to say about this place! Only other thing I can say is that haters gonna hate!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and selection of beers. The winter mule is absolutely delicious! I'm didn't get to try the food, but everything looked and smelled soooo good. I will definitely be back for a beer and a bite!"}
{"text":"So I checked this place out on a Saturday night and a Sunday afternoon.

Saturday I stumbled upon this place and I loved how many beer choices they had. There whole set up outside is amazing! Cornhole, beerpong, huge sitting area. Loved it! I tried an IPA, so good! 

Sunday I came for brunch. So they have bottomless mimosas, but they charge a penny. Which I thought was weird but apparently they're aren't legally allowed to say its free refills on the mimosa pitchers. BUT a penny per refill? yeah take my pennies! Although the pitcher was a bit small for my taste but I just love alcohol. The waiter was really nice even after we asked to be moved 3 times!!! because it was raining and they don't close the back door or front door so we were getting some water to the face. STILL had a blast and giving them a 5! Way to go!

Definitely gonna go again when I'm in town!!



HOWEVER!! my only issue were the chilaquiles.... the cooks really need to some research on what chilaquiles are. I received a bunch of like nacho chips with salsa cheese and eggs just in a very small middle part. The rest of my chilaquiles were so dryyyyy. Thank god for all the mimosas."}
{"text":"This place is great! After I had my breakfast, the manager walked over and asked me how everything was going. He informed me that it was only their 2nd day open! I would have never guessed. This place already works like a well oiled machine. Awesome atmospheric, fun staff, good food and bottomless mimosas. Do I need to say more?!"}
{"text":"Came for the first time on MLK day. We were practically the only ones there, but service was rather slow and waitress was uninterested and never checked on us. We won't be returning. The food was hit or miss. Some was cold. One burger order was taken wrong and the waitress kept insisting that the customer was wrong. We were a little taken aback by that. Another burger was ordered medium rare and was served cold and medium well."}
{"text":"The first time we came to this place I would give it 4 stars. Unfortunately they don't seem to be consistent.
Positives; Good beer, great outdoor seating, lots of TV's
Negatives; Service is hit or miss (once good, once bad), expensive if not there for happy hour. We had the \"sustainable popcorn\". This would not have been my choice, but our friends ordered it to share. OMG..so gross. Soggy, grease covered popcorn with chunks of fatty pork belly & undercooked bacon. Who came up with this mess? Yuk! Also made the mistake of getting nachos. Please put the pile of sour cream in a separate container..it turned all the chips into a soggy mess.. Felt sick all night after eating those 2 appetizers. Won't go back unless I am only drinking beer at happy hour.."}
{"text":"We had a great time here when we visited on a Wednesday night! They have a long list of beers - both house made and others. I like how the menu is organized by how light or dark the beer is, although some additional information (IBUs, and maybe a short description) would be very helpful in making a decision, since dark beers are not always heavy and light beers are not always \"light\". Our waitress seemed to be familiar with the menu options and provided guidance and testers. They were having live band karaoke the night we were there. I had never done live band karaoke, but it was a blast! I like how the bar is set up, with the band on one end. That makes it easier if you want to sit and talk with friends while the band plays. I also noticed a large patio, which we did not utilize since it was blazing hot. I thought this place was really cool, and it was a great way to end a fun night in Tempe."}
{"text":"Definitely try their house brewed beers. Very impressed. Outstanding food. LA fried chicken sandwich is highly recommended. We devoured the southwest fries to start. Really friendly staff and cool place overall. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool little spot on Mill Ave. I've only ever been here later at night, so I'm not totally familiar with it when it's not a crowded, college kids bar scene. It's a super clean place, the bartenders have always been really awesome when I go in there, and they have fun games. My only complaint is that the outdoor area has close quarters. Idk how many times we were by the outside bar area and ping pong balls were hitting us or whatever. Otherwise, pretty cool spot."}
{"text":"11/10 the service here is outstanding!! Andres the bartender is incredible personable and server! The food and drinks are unmatched blasted barley is a sure fire way to experience arizona"}
{"text":"They have a great mimosa deal from open until 3pm on saturday's & sunday's, the service is awesome, bartenders are attentive & social! Ask for andres if you go :)"}
{"text":"Great place! Wide selection of beers and excellent food along with an awesome ambiance. Would definitely prefer to come here as opposed to other places on Mill. It's clean and well put together. The staff is friendly and attentive. My favorite place to spend time off or have lunch at between classes."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Tempe scene...I am always a fan of new places opening along the light rail line.   This place is quite large and I loved the 2 patios - one in front and one in back.  I can only speak for the drinks as we didn't eat any food during our visit - extensive drink list, so definitely something for everyone.  Our server was tremendous - lots of fun and really added to our experience."}
{"text":"I've only been for brunch and had a great experience every time.  Staff is always friendly.  The live music can be a little hit or miss, but overall I enjoy my lazy weekend mornings spent drinking bottomless mimosas here.

Food-wise, I've only tried one thing: chicken and waffles. I can't remember what's in the sauce, but it's amazing!  AND there's some cilantro on the chicken which I would have never thought to put with fried chicken, but it's a surprising delightful flavor combination."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great beer selection, wings, and good happy hour. Our server was informative and attentive. They brew several of their own beers, I tried the A Mountain Amber and their hef. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Found this place by accident while out walking in Tempe. The cool patio and games caught out eye so we decided to go in. Corn hole, Jenna, connect 4 and other games make this place fun. Cool live band on Saturday morning and bottomless mimosas!!"}
{"text":"So we didn't hate this place, but we also didn't love it. The decor and patio is really great. Our service was ok, nothing stellar. The food was the same. Just ok. We went for brunch a while ago and some of our food came out cold. We also had leftover  lipstick on a glass... really just underwhelming. Not terrible, but I don't know that we'll go out of our way to eat here again. This may be just a place we go to have a few drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"For being a craft beer bar, the kitchen was surprisingly on point. The quinoa bowl, especially, was fresh and full of delicious veggies. Put a couple of fried eggs over it, drown it in hot sauce and call it a day. Or at least call it a filling and healthy lunch. 

There's plenty of indoor and patio seating and the live music (two dudes on guitar / vocals during our visit) added a nice touch of audio. Also, TV's everywhere for The Sports. 

Extensive beer menu and full bar + all you drink brunch mimosas. I didn't have a chance to try any of the house brews but managed to find a delicious Irish stout by SD-based Mike Hess. Plenty of California and Arizona craft brews to choose from. 

We popped in for lunch before a spring training baseball game so I can't speak to what this place is at night, but it was a great midday choice to relax and enjoy some tasty food and beer."}
{"text":"Food was good, I had the Thai Chicken salad.  Loved it.  Fiance had the hamburger cooked perfectly, correct amount of ingredients.  However menu was slightly out of date so unable to get an item.

Beer menu, was extensive a great selection. Of their own beers plus guest beers.  Happy Hour prices were great.

Outside patio was nice, staff was friendly.  

I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Came back because heard they were brewing their own beer. They offered 5 house selections.  We tried all but the Mountain Amber.  The hibiscus guava was my favorite and had a light fruit flavor. Kolsh had a light flavor but a decent alcohol content at 6.8. The stout was also light but tasty. 

Alley sat outside on the front patio.  All patrons treated her kindly and she enjoyed the under the table shade. She drank ice water from her bowl.  

The beer gets 4 stars but ugh, flies, flies and more flies so minus 1. Looking forward to more home brews."}
{"text":"First and last time here. We walked in and did not have a server come for 15 minutes. The beer selection is not great, and one of the so-called \"bartenders\" does not, for the life of her, know how to serve a beer. Consistently flat and overpriced beers."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place because 1) Services was horrible and we were even setting at the bar. 2) Inconsistent on making drinks, 3) expensive.  I work for a hotel company i will not recommend my guest to Blasted Barley."}
{"text":"I have been here dozens of times in the past when I wasn't as active on Yelp and have never had an issue.  Numerous times I have been here with other cyclists and even a few event post parties were held here.  We have always brought our bikes on the patio.  Wednesday March 15 2017 after our group ride \"Loops\" We asked the Host/Hostesses if we could bring our bikes on the patio and we were asked \" are there still bikes racks out there?\" By the host.  We were a little put off by his response so we pleaded our case and we were  still shut down.  The patio was nearly empty and there was only 4 of us.  Our bikes would have easily stacked up right next to our table.  Never had this problem in the past, but I won't have the same problem here again.  My money and bike was accepted down the road on 1st Street near Hardy."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because we were really looking forward to the \"Blasted Popcorn\" and if you take a look at the photos.... the bowl was filled with kernels. The bacon, pork and popcorn were delicious- just super bummed on the delivery. 

In other news, the PB&J burger was delicious! This is the first time we've ever tried this kind of concoction. Small amount of peanut butter and almost couldn't really taste the jelly, nonetheless, it was still delicious. I will definitely order it again.

This place has a ton of selections on alcohol and some fun games on the patio. Great for company HH's or early outings!"}
{"text":"I think Blasted Barley is right on pace for the changing Mill Ave with USAA and State Farm adding another 40 - 50,000 new mid to high class jobs to Tempe in the next year. 

The price point may be slightly high but Mill Aves lasting business is the businesses not the college kids anymore. As seen most college driven bars close after the spring and summer hits. Most are going to Old Town Scottsdale these days. 

They have seemed to bring that unique feel with oversized pong, skeeball, brewer vats, wood grain and more. I'm sure the prices will go down a bit once it starts to get a bigger following. 

Cool spot, worth stopping through if your hip, fun and like a good brew."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and patios. The service is a little slow so plan on lazy unrushed brunch. It's worth it though."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time in Saturday. To start, the first three beers I tried to order for my flight were out. That was a bit annoying. It seems like they were pretty low on their draft beer. Then, my husband ordered the turkey burger. On the sign it was it was made with ground turkey, but it came out as just a turkey breast slice. It was like an overpriced deli sandwich at that point and didn't have any flavor. We told our waiter and his response was \"oh they were probably out of ground turkey in the kitchen. I don't know what it is supposed to be. I haven't looked at the special today\". First, our waiter should have known what the special of the day was. Second, a restaurant should ask us before making a substitution like that.  We would have ordered something different from the menu at that point. He didn't apologize and just awkwardly walked away like we did something wrong for asking about it. 

I got the kale and beer salad. It was okay. I am torn to say if we would ever come back based on the experience we had. The only good part of the place was that it is dog friendly on the patio. They even brought my dog a bowl of water, which was nice."}
{"text":"We went for brunch! We did get up and grab our own menu, but whatever why not burn those calories. I loved the guy who was performing for us. Great spot for early morning brunch and a great menu."}
{"text":"Where to begin.. I hardly ever write reviews but this place is too good. Staff is very friendly and easy going, even to our black lab, dogs can sit on patio. There is a front and back patio, both of which get decent sunlight. The wings were juicy and meaty with crispy skin and a delectable sauce. My favorite thing about this place is their seasonal brew, st nobles stout. If you consider yourself a beer snob (or don't, everyone should drink this) then please PLEASE treat yourself to one of these unbelievably smooth mint chocolate stouts. I really can't think of anything I'd rather drink, at any time of year. Unfortunately it's seasonal for st pattys. I would still recommend this place year round for the atmosphere, service, food, and beer selection. I'll be back"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday morn right at opening time of 10:00.  The hostess was very courteous and helpful getting our seating arranged, as there were 8 of us.  All of us gave big thumbs up on the food.  We all had brunch items.  The bacon is so good.  I had the biscuits and gravy and it was awesome, maybe the best I've had.  This was our first time here, so don't know how the service is when it's busier, but the 3 servers that we're working this morning all appeared to be taking care of business with their respective tables."}
{"text":"Great service! Even better food. Nice outdoor patio for weekend day drinking. Games and such really set this bar apart. You must get the pork belly popcorn. Unless you are a vegetarian, it will not disappoint! The grilled cheese is also note worthy. Will drive to Tempe to visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"I need to amend my review. The GM, Jake, reached out to me by email, and explained their best practices to align with city ordinances and address guest safety. He also shared that they had an all-staff meeting after receiving this review (and my email) and discussed some options they have. Because he reached out to me, we stopped by there yesterday and met him. He's a solid guy with lots of industry experience and perspective. He took the time to get to know us, and shared some of his background. We'll definitely go there again, their food and drinks are too good to miss! 
Original review-We went there one night last week and got great service, tonight was different. Our drinks (cocktails and beers) were served in plastic cups. Cocktail glasses were the same size as glass ones, but the beer cups were not full pints, rather maybe 12 oz. Other patrons who seemed to be friendly with the staff were being served in regular pint-glasses. When we asked the bartender she said they change to plastic at 10pm (false, from our previous visit). I tried to speak with a manager after I closed my tab, no luck, he was not around.
Their porkbelly loaded fries, from our last visit were delicious."}
{"text":"Well, I have now joined the club of people who take their dogs to restaurants.  We recently had brunch here following a pack walk around Tempe Town Lake with my pup's trainer and some other nice doggies and their people.  The folks at Blasted Barley set up one of the patios for us, and were super accommodating.

The house Bloody Mary was a steal for $5.  No, it did not come with a full meal on a stick in the drink, just lemon, lime, and olives.  But it was a little spicy and perfect.  Also had the breakfast burrito with bacon and had no complaints there, either.  Now my dog had the sweet potato waffle (among other things).  I stole a pinch and showed remarkable restraint in even letting him have it.  I kind of wished it were mine.  Don't get me wrong, he'd love the burrito, too.  I'm just happy when what he eats is actual food.

Great place for brunch!  I look forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"What an awesome upgrade for the space previously The Tavern! We sat at the bar, enjoyed great service by the bar staff and were super impressed with our chop salad and Gouda burger, which were many steps above the expectations of \"bar food\". Actually a very creative menu that made it hard to decide on our dinner choices before we finally agreed to split entrees. Would highly recommend and will absolutely look forward to the next concert date night when we can return."}
{"text":"I am a recent transplant from Oregon and had guests in town for the game. In short. I ended up here twice this past week and was impressed each time. The food is really delicious and the service was outstanding. A special shout out to Monroe who was not only a fantastic server but hilarious as well. Food recommendations-wise, I had the LA Chicken sandwich with fries which are real cut potato vs frozen manufactured. Now that I've been twice though, I prefer the shoestring onion rings over the fries. My daughter had the hangover burger which is enormous and pretty tasty, per her. My husband had the green chili burger and said it was really good. Also consumed amongst visits was pork belly mac & cheese, Philly green chili sandwich (amazing), Blasted Cobb which has over easy eggs instead of hard-boiled, and the footlong grilled cheese baguette. That was the blandest of all but if you're looking for not spicy and not sure what you want to eat; get this. Get the loaded tots!!! We had the beer cheese with bacon and it was divine. All of us loved it. Now let's talk beer. The BB brands were all really good beers. Hubby had a flight and couldn't decide which he liked best. I would go out of my way for their Hefeweizen which has that lovely banana/clove/lightly sweet taste that is found in German style beers. I will absolutely be back and I absolutely recommend this place to visitors to Tempe."}
{"text":"Great place! Great service! Loved the decor! Live band was nice! Food was good! If you haven't been here you need to try it out!"}
{"text":"Went for paint nite, arrived early for dinner which wasn't edible, don't order California chicken sandwich, couldn't even bite through the chicken, string onion rings were flavorless, just a pile of onion grease, also they should invest in citronella candles the mosquitos were eating us up. No need for us to ever return."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my entire life. I walked in and for 45 minutes not one waiter or server came to even speak to me. I had to personally ask one of the other waiters to help me and they told me they would get my waiter. That fiasco took another 10 minutes. Then i ordered my food and I waited an outrageous, unprofessional, 90 minutes before I even got my food. By the time i got my food it was cold and was not thoroughly cooked. I then asked to speak to a manager and he was utterly lost like a deer in the headlights. He refused to take ownership of his poor service team and blamed it on the UFC fight we had gone to see. After i voiced my concerns to him he said he would look into the problem. I never saw that unprofessional,lazy, poor excuse for a manager again and had our waiter give us a garbage coupon that did nothing to alleviate the unpleasant and frankly awful experience I had there. To top off the night I then waited another 35 minutes for my card to be processed. All i got were excuses and empty words from this sham of an establishment. I strongly do not recommend this restaurant because frankly they do not deserve your money. The service is the worst I have ever experienced in my life and no customer should be subjected to that. They will never get my business or anybody I know business ever again."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere!

Nice lay out, all service was super nice and nice to be outside near Milll.

Also, Cake is playing."}
{"text":"Bad service! Was waiting for food for 50mins after we ordered. We also did not get a water refill after we asked twice and waited over 30mins, so we left. Will not return"}
{"text":"We came here for the New Year's Eve Shindig! All of the service was amazing especially our server Nicole (I believe that was her name). They made New Year's special and it was an awesome venue. I definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"This place is off the chain. Went here with a group of girls on a Sunday. The restaurant was packed but we still got a prime table with no wait. Because they were so busy and the kitchen is small, there were a number of items on the brunch menu that they ran out of. However, I had the best experience with a limited menu and I can't imagine how awesome it would be on a less busy day! Rob, the manager, was super chill and even brought us a round of shots! Danielle was one of the greatest and friendliest servers I have had at any restaurant. She was extremely knowledgable and her service was incredibly efficient. The BYO omelet was delicious and they have everything imaginable to make it with. Overall, this experience was great and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I came here around Christmas with my dog. I had the hangover burger and an order of the mozzarella cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were really good, it says they're home made and sure tasted like it. Compared to other places that just use frozen ones. I'd definitely go back to Blasted Barley."}
{"text":"Great decor, mediocre service and lack luster food. Try if you dare but I would suggest spending your time and money while in Tempe elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for UFC night since they were showing it. The place is hidden in the back, you have to drive in a parking lot and drive all the way down to see it. It is not off the main street so be on the lookout when you are not familiar with the area as I was. When we got in we went to sit at the bar and instantly they told us that they were understaffed and apologized. Hey it happens, whatever. I still feel like I got pretty fast service at the bar and was paid attention to so that didn't affect us. I loved that they had adult capri sun and spiked hot chocolate. That really got my attention. Never been to a place that had that. I ordered a Vodka Collin and it was not good. It tasted like minute maid lemonade and barely any vodka. I wouldn't order that again. Maybe they didn't know how to make it, idk. I also ordered an appetizer which was the half & half fries (half sweet potato, half onion rings) and they were far from good. They were unsalted and the onion strings were really soggy and not crispy at all. However, I still liked the service, im gonna give em a pass because maybe they were seriously lacking staff and couldn't get things done properly so meh. Service good, food not so good. Ambience was great."}
{"text":"Great service. Good selection of beers. Nice live music without being too loud. A bit limited on the food, but overall nice atmosphere. Good outdoor seats."}
{"text":"My partner ate the whole thing, double bacon burger.  It's HUGE.  Two hamburger patties on a brioche bun Topped with bacon and fried shoestring onion rings.  You get a free beer if you eat it all.  The sweet potato fries were really good too. 
I had the classic club with house smoked turkey breast, was really good with a side salad and balsamic vinaigrette"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely awful food. They purposely forget sides and items but charge you for a meal and serve cookies that are cookie dough that isn't baked and tastes like nothing. The grilled cheese is awful. Can't pay me to eat here again"}
{"text":"Service was poor.  Can't speak for the quality of the food as it didn't arrive. We got water, placed our order, waited 45 minutes and then left. As we got up to leave was the first time the waitress had acknowledged us in 15 minutes. The place was maybe half full and it was 1 PM."}
{"text":"Worst service, ever. Our waiter is as visible as Amelia Earhart. Took 40 minutes to get some of our drinks. I gave up and went to Starbucks for my cup of coffee. One and a half hours after we ordered, our party had not gotten all of our meals. If there are more than a half dozen people here, walk on, the staff will be overwhelmed.
Tables around us also had to get up to check on their orders.
The food, once it arrived, was mostly acceptable, despite plates being delivered with 20 minute intervals.
The wait staff needs help. The kitchen apparently needs help. If you decide to eat here, bring a blanket and a good book."}
{"text":"Love this place and the team here! I came here for NYE with my friends, and we had reserved a table for 8. It was in the perfect spot on the patio and the team was greatly accommodating despite the fact it was crazy busy during NYE. We had a great time, even though there were a number of miscommunications in the beginning. But what can you expect, it was a busy NYE!

The atmosphere was perfect and lived up to the expectations of my friends, I would gladly come back here for any special occasion or just a night out. 

Thank you Dulia, you are the best!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Not super packed so it's a great place to enjoy a drink with friends. They even make their own \"adult Capri suns\" which are pretty good for vodka drinkers! Cute patio too!"}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday at 3:15 pm to score a few beers and some food before going to the summer ends concert.  The place was busy but the hostess told me the wait was only 10-15 minutes for a table, we put our names in (didn't get a pager or anything) and headed to the bar. The beer selection was good and the service was very friendly. 

After about 30 minutes I went back to the hostess stand and asked how our table was coming along, and she assured me they were cleaning off a table and it would be ready soon. After ten more minutes,  I go back to the hostess and she informs us that some random group just walked in and took our table.  Apparently the manager told her that he couldn't make them leave the table.  Sooooo what the hell are reservations and putting your name in for?  

After waiting a freaking hour for a table she finally comes up to me and asks \"are you guys still waiting on a table?\". Ummmmm yeah!?!?! Once sat we waited for a bit and when our waitress arrived she let us know service was going to be slow because she was stretched so thin;  great. 

We put in our food asap because we were trying to make it to the concert at five to see a performer.  The pork belly popcorn was an interesting idea but I wasn't a big fan; dry and lacking ingredients I just picked the pork off the top. We also ordered the pulled pork mac and the fried chicken sandwich.  The mac tasted store bought and was covered with bacon bits. It was just okay. My husband's sandwich was pretty decent.  

Needless to say, we were late to the concert.  The bartenders and beer selection were good, but the way the place is ran is a joke. After waiting an hour for a table we didn't have a manager talk to us or even apologize.  Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Wow, if I built a bar, I would do it this way.  The bar itself is huge with seating for over 30 people.  The outside vignettes are exquisitely designed and easily accessible.  This place flows beautifully.  The staff is super friendly and welcoming. To be fair I was there on a Monday late morning, so it was not very crowded, but regardless I could see this place hopping with people everywhere. The food is superb, forget about your typical Fried bar fare, this is down to earth well made food that is actually good for you.  Vegetarians and vegans will delight at this menu.  

Plenty of TVs to catch a game.  And the seating at the bar or the bar area is unobstructed for easy viewing from multiple angles.  Bonus points for power plugs everywhere!  Bathrooms are industrial chic and super clean.  

Great place."}
{"text":"I was really enjoying myself until it was time to close my tab and leave. The bartender gave my debit card to someone else and didn't apologize or acknowledge me, she instead had her boss come speak to me. He was really nice and extensively apologized, but the person who had my debit card already spent money on it. I had to call my bank at 1am and cancel my card and file a report. I was visiting from California and now I didn't have a debit card. I would just have liked her to acknowledge her mistake to me instead of running away. 

On the bright side ! The beer was pretty good and the atmosphere was fun. If I get the chance to visit again, I'll just make sure not to leave a tab open  ;)"}
{"text":"The bar was very nice and big.   Totally looks different from when it was the Tavern. The staff was nice. They were always checking on us.  I wasn't really impressed with the menu.  I felt it was very limited.  One side only for food.  Their beer menu was a lot bigger and had more choices.  The food menu was all over the place from chicken and waffles to hamburgers and Mac and cheese.  It was very hard to choose something decent to eat so I just went with the Mac and Cheese to be safe. 

If you like beer and microbrews this would be a good place to go.  If you want food I would pass."}
{"text":"First visit and definitely enjoyed the food.  Chicken wirh waffles and L.A. Chicken were both outstanding.  Liked the use of the waffles aa the bun.  Disappointed to learn they don't have any beers of their own due to ownership/ license change.  Their website NEEDS to be updated since it has been months. Still a good beer selection on hand. Hopefully they will be a real Brewery soon!"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Nice atmosphere but does not particularly stand out in the area. I have had a few beers, closed tab and moved on. Meh..."}
{"text":"On a night in which my friends and I spent plenty of money on a table and several bottles, we were asked to leave simply because an employee didn't want us there. An employee who decided to have a few drinks after her shift. Not to mention the huge rat that we saw on our way out. It was a horrible way to be treated especially after having spent so much money."}
{"text":"Went in for a drink after a long day of conventions.
Service was fast and friendly.
Drinks were good and strong.
Our appetizer was pretty darn good, Popcorn of Sustainability. Try it when your there! Pork belly, parmesan and sage. Yum!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here. I had the Thai Chicken Brown which was fantastic. The flavors all came together so well! I also had a berry beer which was great. I'm not a beer drinker. If I drink one, it needs to be sweet. This one was sweet and sour. My husband had a fried chicken sandwich. His reply was that it was meh. No seasoning. Just a chicken breast fried in flour. Our friend who accompanied us had the super human vegan bowl. She the quinoa was great in it! Overall great place! Not 5 stays but not bad either."}
{"text":"Great craft beers! The cream ale is amazing. Happy hour pricing is super great considering it's only 3$ for their beers! The popcorn of sustainability was incredible..love the pork belly! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great vibe. An excellent place to watch The Devils!  Make sure you see Matt at the bar. Bro is on his game. We'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I visited today with a co-worker and got there shortly after noon and sat at the bar in hopes of quick service so we could get back to work. We were given menus, but the bartender didn't ask for our drinks for about 10 minutes. He came back and we ordered waters he delivered them and said he'd be right back. Knowing that we were waiting for a bit he offered to take care of an appetizer for us. We got the chips and guacamole. We ate all of our guacamole and my water was empty and he bartender came to us and said are you ready for your tab!? I was like we have not even got the two tacos that we ordered. He brought them out and said he would take care of 1/2 of our tab. We then again had to proceed to ask for our tab from another bartender. Finally we left at about 1:25. This was my second time visiting. The first was a few months ago and the same service happened around the same time to my husband and I. The food was good, however the bartenders always seem to be more distracted with things other than their customers."}
{"text":"Blasted Barley is always a fun time!! The food and beer is amazing. My personal favorite on the menu is the Southwest Smothered Fries! (only $5 on happy hour!!!!) Great prices and great staff. I've also been on weekends when it has a night club atmosphere. Awesome DJ, awesome and quick bar service (even though it is always packed), very fun crowd and AMAZING power hour deals from 10-12 pm including $1 dos xx, $2 wells, $3 jameson and titos and a couple other deals! Bruch is also a steal with $15 bottomless mimosas and the outstanding omelettes. Blasted is the place to be at all times! Never has disappointed me and i've always had amazing service with every server i get!"}
{"text":"I peed on the floor when it was the tavern now I pee in the sink. But really now on 2 occasions they were serving me their home brew beer and calling it bud light. The manager went nuts when we told him it wasn't bud light and told us to leave. Fluff this place go to moonshine!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot on Mill Ave.  The patio both front and back have a great atmosphere and have plenty of umbrellas for shade.  The lunch service here is very fast and the staff is very friendly and have great suggestions!  I am always looking for a place to accommodate our work group usually 5- 8 people, Blasted Barley is perfect.  The lunch menu was awesome, great salad selection my favorite Smoked Cobb Chop.  Check out the selection, I can't wait to come back for happy hour and try out their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch over Ironman weekend.  Took over 1 hour to get food after we ordered.  Staff was nice enough, but come on management, staff up for event weekends.  It wasn't even that busy, lots of empty tables but just couldn't get food out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with different types of groups. I really want to love this place, but something seems a tiny bit off. I'm confused by the demographic they're trying to cater to. Is it the ASU crowd? Professional crowd? Laid back? Fun? Family vibe?

Positives:
GREAT beer selection
Really good food
Bartenders are really nice
Cool layout, except for the area where they allow dogs (outside)
Awesome patio/deck area
Service is pretty good

Negatives:
Mixed drinks are a bit expensive for what you get (very small portions). Of course it's a brewery, so maybe that's why
Deck/patio is awesome but they allow cigar smoking, so it's not fun trying to eat your delicious meal with smelly cigar wafting in your face
The outside game area where dogs are allowed smells like dog piss

Also, the last time I went, my husband and I stopped in for a quick meal with our toddler. We ordered a bunch of food and our bill was pretty high. I noticed when we were leaving that the manager ran over to our table and checked to make sure we paid (he grabbed the leather check holder) and didn't walk out on our check. That was a bit annoying and insulting. 

Overall:
It's a good place to eat/drink, but I'd recommend waiting for cooler weather and enjoying their amazing front patio - back patio is smoking. Plan on ordering beer (great selection) unless you want to overpay for cocktails that are small and a bit watered down. Try the mac n cheese for a nice spin on an old recipe."}
{"text":"Other than liking the atmosphere, their pork sandwich may be one of the best I've ever had and the staff was friendly and attentive.  All three of draft beers that we had were quality, too.  We were there at 4pm-ish on a weekday, though, so don't know how the experience may differ during peak hours."}
{"text":"We visited on Saturday during the daytime. It was a beautiful day out, and we really loved the patio! The redesign since it was the Tavern is awesome. It looks really sharp and has a fun atmosphere. We only came for a few beers and did not eat, so I have no review on the food. We enjoyed our beer-I tried the strawberry beer that they brew there, and it was delicious. Also, they had fireball on tap, which was a nice touch.
The only (and big) complaint that we had was the service. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very rude. It wasn't that she was too busy or made some sort of error, but she was just completely unfriendly. We asked her about the other beers that were to come in the future from the brewery, and she completely blew off our question. Even if she did not want to make small talk with us, I believe that she was doing her employer a disservice by not even attempting to bring back repeat business."}
{"text":"whole lotta love...

While milling around Mill Ave we came across Blasted Barley, Drawn in by the out door speakers cranking some great classic rock. 

I have never noticed this spot, as I had written off The Tavern many years earlier, and had no reason to venture back into Hayden Square. Back in the day Balboa Club was a regular haunt. It was nice to see the cool changes inside.

The place has a big patio out front and a well dressed 100 foot shotgun style pub, with a bar top almost as long.

Happy hour and beer selections were great and prices fall in line with the average around town.

Service was welcoming and friendly from the nice young lady behind the bar. Blasted Barley is back on my radar for cool spots to duck into off Mill."}
{"text":"Visited Blasted Barley today and Marcella helped me out. She was so friendly and knew so much about all of the beers! 10/10 would visit again. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and tasty drinks! The atmosphere is fun, but relaxed. Perfect for Sunday brunch and hanging out. If you want to watch any games there are tv's all around!"}
{"text":"This weekend was my first time at Blasted Barley (although I frequently went back when it was The Tavern) & it was ok. We got there at 11 AM & I was starving so I ordered the BBQ sandwich, but they said its only the brunch menu until 12 & then after that they have salads & wings.. And our whole table wasn't very impressed with the brunch menu. I am not picky and yet I had trouble finding something to eat. The food was all weird combinations, they didn't really have anything normal. A few people waited until noon but I was starving -- my boyfriend & I split a egg plate. It was good. I just don't think I would come back because of the selection & menu choices. Great patio though!"}
{"text":"personal mimosa pitchers??? my kind of place!! definitely coming back for brunch, food was good but took a little too long. Was catching up with some friends so it made waiting for the food a little more bare-able. Our server was attentive and made it a point to apologize for the wait on the food!!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and beers are real tasty and affordable. My only 2 quarrels: It's so damn HOT in there! It's like a SAWNA! (sauna). Not sure if it's because the doors are always open or what, but good Lord, Ima just bring my workout gear in the future and do some hot yoga. Secondly, when you blow that paper confetti everywhere, people slip and fall on it! Seems like a good way for someone to create an injury issue. But wtf do I know. I'm just a nice kid with some nice dreams."}
{"text":"Went to Blasted Barley on a Thursday night with a group of friends. It was pretty dead so we took a spot on the back patio. There were misters so even though it was a little warm out, the patio was still comfortable.

We all ordered drinks and food. The drinks came out pretty quickly but the food took forever! Especially considering there were not many people there at all. When it finally came out, my one friend did not get her salad and didn't get it until the rest of us were almost done. How long does it take to make a salad? 

That being said, I did really like my food. I got the superhuman salad which had sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts, beets, and farro with a turmeric coconut dressing. It was a great combo, the dressing was nice and light and the portion was just right. The brussels sprouts were a little chewy, but I would definitely order this again, I really liked it. 

Final tally - food = awesome, service = could be better."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was a let down. Food was Sub par. Footlong grilled cheese sounded great but no baguette so they just served us a kids grilled cheese. The waffled cáptese - waffle machine was broken so they served a basic tomato grilled cheese. Burger was decent. Wings were good and I really liked their traditional wing sauce. 

Main reason for going was the beers. They weren't bad but nothing special. Just barely average. The Duke of Dank was good. Amber & wheat just okay. They were very bland versions. (See my ratings on Untappd). Service was good but would have helped if the server knew about the problems when we ordered."}
{"text":"Food is a bit overpriced, but it's good. Have been here twice. Good food and great service both times.  Good beer selection. Mimosas with brunch are just right! Acoustic music on the patio, dog friendly, games inside. Overall, a great spot."}
{"text":"Went in around 4 on a Thursday and the place was pretty empty and it seemed inviting.  The wait staff was friendly.  We ordered 3 burgers and a salad.  Took 45 minutes and though the burger buns was good, the rest was nothing at all impressive and very, very poorly prepared.  Under cooked, over cooked, under seasoned and more.  It just seemed that everything was off and everyone at the table commented the same.  It felt like a meal prepared by someone with no cooking experience.  All the right ingredients, just not well executed.

Maybe just and off night but not impressed."}
{"text":"Been going to blasted for years, and have no plans to stop. Super chill and friendly bar tenders that remember me and my usual drink, which is usually just a shot of tequila or a Dos Equis, but they also brew their own great beers. Go chill and watch the World Cup. Viva Mexíco."}
{"text":"Here at 430 on a Saturday post baseball and the bartender took great care of us. Great job and I will certainly return. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Cruised by for a Sat afternoon beer. The front hostess  was uninspired and said just sit anywhere. Walked by the guy on the keyboard that was crazy loud. So i walked to the end of the bar to get away from the bad singing. Sat at the bar and watched the female bartender talk to her friend. The male bartender just punched away at open tickets. i never got an acknowledgment. After 5-10 mins of sitting at a fairly empty bar i just bailed. The staff here couldn't give a shite to serve 4 people who would have had several."}
{"text":"The quality of the food in general is fine. We placed an order through Grubhub at 5:39pm. Our food arrived at 7:32. Terrible! We called the restaurant TWICE and I could hear the snotty hostess telling the manager \"they've already called\" the second time I called. She legitimately told me when I called the first time \"the Grubhub driver just arrived and we are handing them your food\" I call back 20 mins later and the manager said \"yours is the next ticket to be made\" (mind you this is at the hour and a half mark our order had been placed). Liar, liar little hostess. Anyways, $60 was absolutely not worth the cold, mediocracy we received. Oh yeah and the cherry on top? They didn't put lids on the sauce ramekins so our mozzarella sticks were all completely drenched in ranch.  Blasted Barley Grubhub."}
{"text":"Great place! We tried out quite a few of the gastropub type places on our recent trip to the Phoenix/Tempe area and this was one of the best. One of the best servers we've had in a long time and they had several beers I really liked.

The food was outstanding as well, and the ambiance inside was cool too. It was a really hot day (117°) so we ate inside, and it felt nice with the big fans running. The outdoor area looked nice but it was too hot to sit out there on this day.

I like the Thai bowl I had, and the others I was with all loved their food too. I would definitely come back if in the area again.

One thing I didn't like was the parking meters - we are not used to paying for parking in our home state, and these just didn't want to work with credit cards (maybe it was too hot, they were directly in the sun). Luckily we had some quarters so all was good, but it would have been nice if the card readers would have worked. Not a knock on the restaurant, but just be aware for those out of towners to note that you need to pay to park in this area."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place for brunch! Great selection of beers on tap. We went with the bottomless mimosas for $15 and well worth it. They consistently brought over pitchers for refills. The best food option for brunch is the breakfast tacos! My friends got the chicken and waffles and recommend it without the mustard! Also, the manager Tyler was super helpful! 

It does get busy fast so get here before 11:00!"}
{"text":"Tried it on a whim and wound up enjoying a night on their outdoor seating area, listening to a live band. Pretzel bite app was good, but the Thai chicken bowl was phenomenal!! My husband and I both got it and loved it. YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is the spot for brunch! Andrew our server absolutely killed it! Always making sure our bottomless mimosas were filled to the top! Love this place and Andrew!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Definitely go for brunch and get the chicken and waffles and bottomless mimosas. There are a bunch of fun games like skeeball and corn hole and the servers are super nice. Would definity come back."}
{"text":"Good choice of craft beers and the food was great.  The hamburger bun was bordering on amazing."}
{"text":"This place looks really cool when you first walk in. Industrial lighting, big booths, long bar, and games outside. However, when you look closer, it's disgusting. The straws were covered in what I assume to be calcium residue (do they wash and reuse the plastic straws?). Then looking at the bar top I noticed a little roach. I looked behind the bar and the back counter was covered with roaches. They were climbing all over the glasses and counter. I was disgusted. My friend also found a dead fly in his beer. In the pictures below, you can see the straws and a roach in one of the mason jars. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"My suggestion to the twat bartenders is that when a new customer walks in you should try to be a little quieter when talking shit about us. I do commend you though on being able to get me to leave in under 60 seconds, I will never be returning to this place again, but then again you probably don't care. And to the tool of a bouncer who just made a douchey comment about unhappy we looked walking out, you probably should have asked why we were leaving within a minute of walking in."}
{"text":"I was in Tempe/Phoenix for a quick work trip and because of my schedule I wasn't able to leave the hotel for lunch. Thank goodness for Grub Hub who delivered the Thai Chicken Bowl and Blasted Popcorn in under 25 minutes (granted it was around 2:00pm, so I wasn't dealing with large crowds, I'm assuming). 

Thai Chicken Bowl was super fresh. The chicken had great flavor and the dressing tied all of the flavors together. 

I was nervous about the Fresh Blasted Popcorn as in a container, I thought it would become soggy. It didn't. Good flavor, but honestly, a clever idea as someone who considers herself a popcorn connoisseur. 

All in all the food was delicious. To be able to and not have to order only pizza or Chinese food, but something fresh and good - I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Great environment and live singer during day for breakfast and great food and drink prices and staff and manager comes around checking on things and everyone is nice and friendly and prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Walked in and asked for a table. The hostess had just walked out onto the vacant patio. After 5 minutes of waiting we just sat at the bar. Took quite a bit of effort to get a food order in at the bar despite there being only 2 other people at the bar. We ordered, chips and guac, pretzels, Southwest fries with pork belly and one of each taco off their Taco Tuesday menu. I would stay away from the IPA chicken, and fish tacos. But the pork belly and fried avocado tacos were amazing. The gaucamole came out 5 to ten minutes after the food did, and honestly I was hoping he would forget it because I didn't expect the portions to be so large. The guacamole wasnt worth it in my opinion, but the rest of the food was absolutely delicious. 

Also, I don't know if their AC is out, but it was ridiculously hot inside, and I was sweating profusely the entire meal.

I'll likely be returning, but I really hope the service improves."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch with my wife and neighbor. We wanted to try something new, so we came down to Mill Ave to the Blasted Barley. REALLY nice place! VERY big, probably a GREAT place for nightlife.

We sat at the bar and were handed the Beer Menu and a \"Brunch Menu\". They have a VERY nice Beer Selection covering MANY local brews as well as their OWN! We were then told that the \"limited menu\" was actually even MORE limited than it looked. We were told we could have \"Brunch\", (5 different choices) where everything included eggs. Even the Nachos had eggs on them! We were told that we could order Brunch, but NONE of the other sandwiches they had on their menu. They could do a burger, but that's it! 

So, I thought I'd have a Burger! My wife ordered the Nacho like things w/eggs. My neighbor had the Eggs Benedict Special. The food came and was actually VERY good! However, IMMEDIATELY following our meal, (2 mins) my wife said she felt sick! She ran to the bathroom and ended up throwing up. Instantly feeling better afterwards and NOT being sick when she entered, nor AFTER throwing up. We came to the conclusion that ONE of the beers she had, was probably BAD! That's exactly what happens to a person when they get hold of bad beer that's sat too long in a keg, without selling. 

I'd have given them a much higher score had they not had a \"limited, limited menu\". Over 50% of their limited menu wasn't even available to order. The Staff was nice and friendly. But they're restricted in what they can do. They don't make the decisions to not serve food in a restaurant. They'd also have gotten a higher score had my wife also NOT gotten sick! Not sure if we'll be back"}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin with this place! The service was great, food was bomb, and best of all there was live music! I greatly enjoyed the band playing as they were super interactive with the crowd and playing some awesome tunes. You know a place is cool when a 10 week old puppy is completely content hangin' on their patio! Thank you Blasted Barley for being so accommodating to her and to us. One staff member went out of her way and brought our pup a water bowl - so sweet! 

Since they have such great happy hour deals, my friends and I split the pretzel appetizer along with the honey gold wings! Everything was perfect! We all chose to get margaritas (only $12 for 2 at happy hour - decently sized as well!) We all ordered our own mac and cheese entrees. Not the biggest portion but this could be due to the fact that it wasn't that expensive (I believe it was $8 or so)! Regardless.... it was SO yummy! After the appetizers we shared it was the perfect amount of food and we couldn't have left happier (or with fuller bellies). I will be back for happy hour again here, there's no doubt in my mind!"}
{"text":"Good food. Horrible service. Kitchen takes way too long to produce breakfast/brunch foods"}
{"text":"This entire experience was disappointing. We waited by the front door in the heat for someone to greet us and seat us. Once sat we waited about 10 minutes for the server to show up. We weren't given proper straws for our waters, the mimosas were warm, and the food was served to us and then we waited about 5 minutes to receive silverware. We saw our server bus a table before bringing us the requested silverware. My omlet was awful and the manager never even stopped by our table. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every Thursday now for awhile and really like it. 

I meet a running group close by and after our run we normally meet at Blasted Barley for a couple beers & fries. For as often as I've been here, that's pretty much all I've tried. One time our waitress convinced a few of us to try what she referred to as \"vegetarian\" wings (mozzarella sticks that are covered in the \"dynamite\" wing sauce) that were very tasty. The fries here are yummy as well. 

They have a good HH for beer. All of the beers they brew themselves, plus all local beers are $3 a pint until 7. The couple of beers they brew that I've tried were good (I really like the Orca, but they haven't had it in a couple months). They also do a \"lucky lady\" special ($3 for a \"surprise\" brown bag canned beer). Sometimes a few of us will try this. A lot of the time it's Keystone or Nati Ice, often times they'll have something good from San Tan brewery. 

It's never been overly crowded when we come, and service can be hit or miss, but it's never terrible."}
{"text":"Went for brunch ans had a great time, they have a great deck, the food and mimosas were reallu goof and the staff was very friendly, i would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, but there was a weird smell in the building. Their happy hour is amazing!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE hidden gem of Mill Ave! Been to every bar/restaurant and this is by far my favorite. Amazing food (highly recommend the pork belly Mac n cheese or smoked turkey club) great drinks, and phenomenal service!! You're missing out if you haven't experienced this place yet."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday for the 15 mimosa with a penny refill, I must say it was a heck of a deal. The service was super friendly but verrrry slow which is the reason for 3 stars. There was a point where I went over 30 minutes with an empty glass. Otherwise it was fun, football on the tvs was a plus."}
{"text":"Lots of micro brews but no flights.... Huh

Great menu with lots of options including quite a few vegetarian dishes (great since my wife and I are veg). We went to place our order only to discover since its the weekend they only serve a small portion of their menu on weekends and have no vegetarian options. What?? 

So we messed around with the brunch menu and found an apple fritter sandwich with egg,  since we were told the maple syrup had bacon in it we told them to hold that and the we would both have the fritter egg sandwich. 

10 minutes later we find out that of course they have only one of those... So back to the menu. We get one of these egg things and a waffle but ask for syrup without bacon in it.

When we get our order the fritter thing looks awesome except the big chunk of ham on it and the waffle syrup after three confirmations and assurances that it is bacon free... Has bacon. Mmm dry waffle. 

So this place epically sucks. They take back the fritter (I certainly don't want it now) and then come out and apologize as even though the ham isn't mentioned on the menu they randomly threw it in the dish. Maybe because we said we were vegetarian? Seriously who does that? What if I was veg for religious reasons? 2 billion people on this planet don't eat meat so how about not adding it to dishes you claim to not have meat. 

This place is terrible, there are tons of options within 100 feet so skip this place at all costs. 

If you have allergies or food preferences avoid this place like the plague, they don't have a clue what is in their food, they only serve a fraction of their menu on weekends and they are out of the few things they do have... But will happily throw random sh*t into your meal not listed on the menu so if you are into that kinda thing then give this place a try. But if you are a normal human being who likes food and trying new beers then this place is like getting a sharp stick to your eye.

Manager did comp us two beers on a $100 tab for all the trouble of not eating lunch and the band was great so there is that."}
{"text":"This place is so sweet! I love the band playing right now and I can't wait until Wednesday when they have karaoke with a LIVE BAND!! So awesome! Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Wings were good, ladies hot but way over priced, $18 for a coors lite and N order of wings. Stupid high compared to other places near by."}
{"text":"Not a very good experience on 12/30/16. Reserved table and traveled to Tempe specifically to watch UFC event as advertised by Blasted Barley. What they don't advertise is that they do not turn the sound up for the whole event...sound on only for last two fights and turned off within 10 seconds of the end of Rousey fight. Treated very unprofessionally by manager when we requested post fight interviews be turned on. Food average, drinks good. Gave a 2 star based on the awesome server that took care of us. So...if you want average food and a good drink, this is you place...but don't be lured in by a special event, you are sure to be disappointed..."}
{"text":"A nice revision of the previous Tavern and I think, good use of one of those classic brick buildings that make up much of the historical development on Mill Avenue. The owners of Blasted Barley wisely made a decision to implement the windows that open up the bar to the outside when the weather is good - something popularized in the creation of HandleBar grill by the Fork and Dagger consortium, which runs so many good eating places on Mill. I also like the outside seating layout and of course, the prominent view of the brewing equipment, which should go into production any day now.

As for eating experience, I will say that the mix of light type on the menus and low lighting can make for a challenging reading experience. Though the faded type is cool, it isn't all that functional so please, back to dark, solid font on the menu and the happy hour menu - I had to get the bartender to help me find a nice Belgian from the menu and even she had some trouble reading down the list - so maybe some larger type as well.

As for the food and drink, not necessarily in that order, they do adjust the glass for the beer one is drinking, which is a nice nod to proper craft beer treatment. I also had the traditional wings off the happy hour list and quite good - seasoned but not overly saucy and served in a nice stainless steel bowl that was rather functional an unique. I hope to come back and try the curried cauliflower sliders.

Finally, I found the culture of the establishment to be a bit of a cultural mishmash with both craft brew on tap, but also beer from traditional large beverage providers, but that may just be an economic necessity due to the location. If those beers don't sell I hope Blasted Barley considers pulling them from a menu as they don't align with the craft beer and distillery brand that I think Blasted Barley is using to differentiate itself. If nothing else, carry those in the bottle but not on tap. 

Finally, tried the barrel aged cocktail on tap - hmmm, a bit heavy on the orange peel flavor - I recommend calling it a barrel aged variation of the old fashioned versus a name referring to something provocative as I'm assuming another part of the brand mission is popularizing classic cocktails - I'd like to see that aspect of what this establishment can bring to Mill emphasized and I think there is the population to support that sort of quality cocktail emphasis.

Suffice to say, I like Blasted Barley but I think it is working through a bit of an identity crisis - traditional college bar or cater to that strain of gentrification wafting through the halls of historical development on Mill Avenue? Suffice to say, I'll be stopping by and watching the possible changes but Blasted Barley is a step in the right direction."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because of the popcorn, and I was both pleased and displeased with it. I got it to go so I could eat some later so that's not going to be a reason I rate this lower. I really like the concept of the popcorn and am a popcorn lover. Unfortunately when the popcorn came it wasn't crunchy? Like it had already gotten a little chewy from what they put on it. And it wasn't seasoned...I get that you put bacon and pork on top but if I eat the popcorn by itself it had no flavor. Regardless I still ate it because I'm a fiend with uncontrollable eating tendencies. 


Overall I like the atmosphere of this place. It has a HUGE patio area with a lot of group seating kind of feel. It was pretty dead for a Friday night..not sure if that's normal. I don't know if I'll be coming back but that Pb&J burger did catch my attention. Also, the brunch menu looks awesome. Spiked cereal? Sure I'll pay $7 for you to put booze in my cereal milk, take my money!"}
{"text":"Worst place I have ever been! And to make my point more I barley feel the need to say negative comments. 
Service was slow on both drinks and food !! 
We then asked for a manager Thompson who stated this is an every weekend thing because the kitchen is small!! And the food came out wrong 
Comped 1 meal after making us late for a baseball game  (while we waited 2 hours for food) and tried to take 20% off but when I checked bill even that wasn't right !! We didn't send food back, afraid it would tAke 2 more hours! 
Would never go back to this place !! Avoid the shitty service and go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"I don't always leave reviews, good or bad, but these guys really impressed me. Walking in I was impressed with the atmosphere. It wasn't super busy, but it's early. All of the food on the menus looks amazing and the Hangover Burger I got didn't disappoint. More than the food and the atmosphere, I was very impressed with the staff. Our server, Rob, was great and friendly, then the guy who manages the place (didn't get his name) took some time and talked to the table about another restaurant we were thinking about going to. All-in-all, great experience and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place five stars based on the quality of the beer, music, design, and atmosphere....but I had a bartender that was a total bitch when it was their fault they couldnt find my card to close my tab. The first girl I went to ( the same area of the bar I ordered my beer) a blonde girl tries to find my card, she couldnt so she moves on to other customers. After 10 minutes another one comes up and takes a few minutes and finally finds it. This brunette bartender scolds me and says next time dont tell more than one bartender cause you made it confusing for us ( in a total bitch voice )...I have never ever been treated like this by a bartender. You guys really need to have a talk with your bartenders to not treat customers like that. The guys that were coming around to check were really nice and attentative. I probably will just go to El Hefe of somewhere else now unfortunately. I felt really offended by the disorganized females behind the bar!"}
{"text":"Blasted Barley took the place of the Old Tavern and I'm so glad they did! The place has a great patio and they did some redesign so there is more seating both outside and in the front portion of the inside. 

The menu feeds into my new obsession with chopped salads - they have 3 different kinds:

Smoked Cobb Chop  - house smoked turkey, roasted corn, chopped red pepper, bacon, avocado and blue-brie cheese on romaine with ranch and a fried egg

The Not-So-Original Chop - arugula, cous cous, marinated roma tomatoes, crunchy corn, currants and papitas. comes with choice of house smoked turkey or chopped avocado with creamy basil dressing.

Quinoa Chop  - arugula, quinoa, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, papitas, currants, and parmesan cheese tossed with truffle oil dressing

I went with the Not-So-Original and was impressed with the portion to price ratio. The dressing was really good, I need to recreate that recipe at home.  I sat outside on the patio and sipped the wonderful iced tea and enjoyed our gorgeous February weather. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the Chops."}
{"text":"We wanted to love this place.  Really we did.  Maybe we are aging a bit too much to get this place.  The bumping music beckoned us from the street so we headed on over.  We arrived about 11 or 11:30 pm to find a sign for $2.00 Dos Equis (awesome) and I was charged correctly but my friend was charged $5.00 (bummer).  We were both within the discount time frame and ordered separately.  NO BUD LIGHT!  Major strike right there.  Begrudgingly my husband had a Coors Light.  The music seemed promising but was so loud out on the patio that we could barely talk to each other - and the mix of rap music was just awful.  No variety....maybe it was all current stuff.  I love rap but did not enjoy any of it.  It was just too loud out on that patio.  No ash trays for the people in our party who smoked on the patio so they had to use their empty beer cups.  We tried to like this place but won't be back unless the music changes and is a bit softer.  My ears still hurt.  

I read other reviews and maybe this place is good for food.  We didn't get to experience any of the food.  I see it is a dog friendly patio, so maybe I need to check this place out in the day."}
{"text":"Best beer and brunch any where in  AZ, The resurrection or chicken and waffles is a must as well as the Bang Bang"}
{"text":"Awesome Beer, Cool Ambiance, and Great Music Tracks. Great Place!"}
{"text":"I've been to Blasted Barley a few times in the past and have always had good experiences. I went yesterday for brunch and was again, not disappointed!! How many places have Loco Moco on their menu??? Not many! Was excited for their biscuits and gravy also. Did bottomless mimosas for $15/ person which is a GREAT deal, however, our server stopped coming by as often after about 3 mimosas each. Other than that, it was great service and great food! They have a Groupon going on right now too which is $12 for $20. With all of that said, I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked by all the bad reviews because this is one of my favorite restaurants! I haven't had a bad meal here, nor have I had much trouble with the staff. But I'm also very understanding when I see that a waiter is busy, flustered, or just having a bad day. They've always been very apologetic when something is late, or if they get busy. The ambiance is great - especially outside on the weekends when there's an acoustic guitar player there during brunch. The bottomless mimosa deal is perfect for a lazy Sunday brunch, and my favorite salad of all time is the Not-So-Original-Chopped. Actually, every salad is good! Like I said, I haven't had a bad meal here and I've tried most of the menu. Their beer is actually also quite good, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like beer all that much. I love the Strawberry Bottle Rocket for a nice, light spring/summer beer. If you like beer and are kind of a foodie, try this place out."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles OMG T_____T

I came here for the Downtown Tempe Brunch Crawl and was pleasantly surprised at my experience. 

SERVICE: very quick and friendly 

AMBIENCE: there was a live cover band playing and they were awesome! They kept the mood very lively and though there were a lot of people here it wasn't overly loud

FOOD: the chicken and waffle portion was so delicious! It only costed $4 for the brunch crawl. The chicken was fried lightly and topped with a tangy mustard, while the waffle was very light and fluffy and doused in syrup. Soooooo good! I'd come back just to get the full portion :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved the atmosphere, food, and service.  Our server Verity was charming, friendly, attentive and took a great care of us.  Keep up the great work!  Blasted Barley offers great choice of craft beers and the food was amazing.  They have very creative menus such as smoked turkey leg & Waffle, popcorn of sustainability, and many more.  This is an awesome place!  We highly recommend and will absolutely look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Great experience with Tiffany, she was awesome. It's rare to find someone that know so much about the beer menu and the food. She was so great that we came back today and we had the pleasure of having Andrew as our server! Great guy!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for happy hour & loved the margaritas! Only $5 on happy hour special and they were very strong and tasty!! We sat at the bar and the bar tenders were constantly refilling our drinks when they got low..chill atmosphere and would definitely go back and try the food :)"}
{"text":"Great staff and outgoing. Their beer selection is awesome and their food is amazing. By far the best place on Mill Ave to get dessert. They are a little pricey but their atmosphere is awesome and their outdoor patio is immaculate. They have a ton of games! Great place to drink and hang out!"}
{"text":"The worst biscuit and gravy breakfast I've ever had! Also, the chief clearly doesn't know how to cook over medium eggs, for they can out hard, very hard! If you put in a concrete bar top, you should have your tenders place a cloth napkin as a placemat when ordering a meal."}
{"text":"My new go to place!! Friends and I were looking for something different when we found Blasted Barley!
Great set up, location and cool vibe. The wings are amazing, mozzarella sticks super yummy and the LA chicken sandwich was so damn good, my mouth is watering typing this!! 
Blasted Barley is most likely going to be our new favorite place...
Didn't try the home made beer but forsure next time! Looks good and my friends really liked all the beers.."}
{"text":"Matt is awesome. If you get him as your server, you are in for a treat. He knows exactly what you want before you even ask and just how to fit you with more than a couple of their delicious beers. Popcorn is the tits too. Some of the best local brews I have had. Mimosas were legit too."}
{"text":"Monte Cristo sliders are sooo amazing!! I would have never thought I would have liked it by the description, but boy is it tasty!! I also tried the lollipop wings. They were tasty, but the wings were extremely dry and hard to eat. Environment is really cool! Patio seating is beautiful. The waiters are really nice, however could be a bit more attentive. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"This is a fun atmosphere for happy hour, and the double bacon BBQ burger is delicious! If you finish the entire burger, you get a free pint of house beer which is a good deal for $15 considering the size of the burger. Good place to try out!"}
{"text":"Recently I placed an order for delivery through Grub Hub. When it arrived, we only received half our food. It was the first time we ordered from there, so I was a bit disappointed.  I called and spoke to Rob, the manager. Whether it was Grub Hub or Blasted Barley who dropped the ball is irrelevant. Rob immediately apologized and delivered the food himself. Not only did he bring what was left behind, he brought us a brand new order so I wasn't left eating a sandwhich that got cold while we waited. Mistakes happen everyday. It's how you handle them, and Rob handled this one perfectly.  Sidenote, the food was excellent as well. We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"The bottomless mimosas with friends are so fun!! Go with a large group and enjoy the pitchers! Fun and relaxed environment with helpful employees."}
{"text":"Blasted is a blast especially when Rachel is working! They have an awesome selection of local and national brews and started brewing Orange brew. 

Taco Tuesday is the best day to get a good deal.  Pork and Chicken are the best. They make a veggie taco too if you don't like meat. Rachel is the best. Go visit her and have fun!"}
{"text":"Visited after a person on the corner asked us to turn. Said okay and it's a nice enough neo-urban pub. 

BUT, after waiting a little more than 10 minutes with not a person stopping by, we left. Didn't even get water. 

No drinks and no courtesy = No patronage. 

Maybe they're better on other occasions..."}
{"text":"It's crazy how many breweries have open up in Arizona over the last 2 years... On my trip out this time I got to visit about 6 of them and Blasted Barley Beer Company was one of them! Loved the layout of the place! Huge Bar, TVs, and a nice tap selection. Their Blasted IPA is a must try for all you hop heads! Thanks for the stickers!!"}
{"text":"5 stars all day long for our lunch experience! Our server and hostess were amazing! Taco Tuesday is the way to go! Between my husband and I we got to try all 4. They were all delicious, but the fish and pork belly were our favs. The cook made a special grilled cheese for our daughter. We also got a small growler filled with their amazing blasted barley beer for $7!! Can't beat it!! We will defiantly be back to enjoy the comfortable patio, great service and awesome food and drink!"}
{"text":"The WINGSTOCK 2015 event in Mesa was a festival for the TASTE BUDS. I had not ever heard of BLASTED BARLEY's -- however during the consumption of 3 of their DYNAMITE (sauce) wings, I became a fan. I can't speak on the goodness of their beer, because I didn't drink any at WINGSTOCK, but you better believe I will be accompanying my next order of DYNAMITE wings with a glass of their signature barley on tap. There's no impression like a 1st impression and this establishment out BLASTED many at the WINGSTOCK EVENT."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant before an ASU football game. The service was fast and friendly and the food was great. It was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I love blasted barley. They have a nice craft beer selection and some decent home brews. I had their fried chicken sandwich and was pleasantly surprised! Very good!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place looking for bottomless mimosas! Glad I did. The staff was amazing. my fiancé and I had AJ and Danny as our servers and they took great care of us! I got the Turkey club which seemed to be a popular choice that day and loved every bit of it. bf ordered their wings and fries and he enjoyed his as well. I didn't have to flag down the waiters/waitresses to get a refill with the mimosas. they had them quickly. would definitely recommend this place. told my friends about it, this is my new favorite place for Sunday Funday :)"}
{"text":"The cauliflower sliders were mehh. Not worth 10 dollars. They were not crispy either. Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Nothing about my experience here was pleasant, sorry. 

We came into a little bit of chaos trying to find a seat, even though there were not too many people sitting for dinner service yet. I ordered a well drink because of the happy hour menu- the ratio of liquor to water was very weak. I then ordered the not-so original chopped salad- try not-so-good. The arugula was good, but there was a disproportionate amount of the other ingredients- almost like they just opened a bunch of cans of raisins and corn and put it on the plate. 

The service was slow; I feel like everyone else was interested in the tables that had about 15 young girls taking shots than the people ordering dinner. Also, I don't know if it is just because I am from California but I do not appreciate people smoking a few feet away from me while I am eating my food. 

I was hoping I was coming to a nice brewery-inspired restaurant, not just a bar."}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot! The food is delicious! I just love the atmosphere!!! We will definitely be back to try all 30 beers on tap!!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Their own Orange Bomb which is an orange and chocolate stout is great!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Tempe. Food is bomb. Large beer selection in addition to their own brews. Friendly, laid back staff."}
{"text":"Love this place! I love the wings and all of the house brews are incredible. Emily, is an amazing bartender!"}
{"text":"Both times I've been here the bartenders have been friendly, the beer (of which there is a great selection) has been cold and the food has been delicious. They've only been open a few weeks, but so far it looks like they've got a good thing going. 

It will be interesting to see if they're able to keep it up as they get busier, but I'm very much looking forward to this becoming a frequent stop on Mill."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place on mill! Great selection of beers and pretty great food! Taco Tuesdays are amazing too. I know you might be thinking it's a bit pricy for a taco but they are worth it! The staff is always really nice and attentive. Plus they've got some good music playing. This place is great for lunch and even great on a Saturday night. All around my favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Great beer selection on tap. Lots of craft beer to choose from-including several IPA's. One IPA is their own brew. (Is it just me-or does their logo resemble the \"Green Flash\" logo?)
Food was pretty tasty. The nachos were good, a little different than other restaurants. 
Great atmosphere and decor. I saw a report on the news on how they ordered their tables from a company that recycles old barn wood. Pretty cool. 
Nice server-he was training and a little confused, but nice. 
Happy hour looks like an exceptionally good value. 
In the heart of downtown Tempe. 
Outdoor patio is unique. Will be nice when the weather cools down. 


Cons:
Although the food was tasty, the portions were rather small and the prices were a little high. 
Chipped water glass. 
Another person in my party asked if the sliders could be baked instead of fried and server said no because they are frozen. He did let us know that they are prepared and frozen each morning, but who wants frozen food anymore-especially when you are paying $12+ for an entrée. 

Bottom line: I'd probably go back for the cool atmosphere and great beer selection. I wouldn't plan on eating a meal, maybe just happy hour food."}
{"text":"Hostesses were rude. Spent their time texting before greeting customers. Took forever to get our appetizer, which was only chips & guac. Fries were soggy and extremely oily. There were puddles of grease on the pan. They tried to remedy the situation by adding more greasy fries on top. Our second waitress was really nice so this review is mostly based on the food."}
{"text":"Showed up around 9 p.m. -- place was empty. Bouncer/ chef combination showed us inside. Also didn't card anyone from our large group but did card our one friend who was a late straggler -- rude! We sat at a rickety table that was clearly poorly designed. One leg supported the entire table, leaving it rocking back and forth like the titanic post-iceberg. Fortunately this sinking ship had some survivors. I'd like to credit the empty establishment to the music they chose to play. The playlist featured songs you'd find on a \"stuff white people like\" messenger board. I decided to order the \"CURRY CAULIFLOWER NO-MAC WITH CHEESE\" -- the only thing that was gluten-free on the menu. The cheese wasn't cheesy and the cauliflower didn't benefit from the curry. 6/10 for the meal, which was redeemed only by the warm potato chips served with meal. \"Meal\" is used loosely here, as the price didn't justify the size. Maybe it was perfect size for a European. But as a red-blooded American I need to eat until I can't breathe. $10 for a snack? no thanks, capitalists. peace out, blasted barley. enjoy your orange bombs."}
{"text":"Inconsistent, though friendly service/execution/setup/flair pulls 3 stars, but delicious solutions made of beer chicken gets four. 

Play-by-play:

I delicately ask if there are any medieval turkey legs atop a waffle available, without getting my hopes up. 

I am informed that yes, I can acquire said dish! 

I order two immediately. Hopes way up now.

I am re-informed that the kitchen is actually out of turkey legs.

Before I can cry audibly, they counter with the IPA chicken atop a waffle. 

I order two immediately. 

Solid four stars for a fantastic meal coupled with an emotional roller coaster of broken promises."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great craft brews. Would highly recommend to anyone working in the area for happy hour and check out Matt T. he will let you know about all the in house brews, great for groups or date night :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars, because the food was good..however this was the worst dining experience I've ever had. We had a group of 12. First off, our server did not write down our orders, came back and asked two times and finally the third time he wrote our orders down! Second, my friend has a food allergy and asked for egg whites he said absolutely not \"the kitchen was too backed up\" and the restaurant wasn't even full! They told us we could only order off the brunch menu and half of the items were unavailable! We spoke to a manager and he said everything was available. Communicate with your staff!! After 2 hours, the server decided to tell us we took a table that was reserved... Hello!! Don't sit us there then! He also failed to put in multiple orders. He had the opportunity to make a lot of money off our table but def messed that up by his poor attitude. Overall I don't think I'd go back. Great patio and music. Blasted barley, pull it together! 

P.s. Don't order the chilequiles , it was nachos with eggs!!"}
{"text":"My previous brunch review was reported because of my discussion of the inappropriate attire of a waitress during our brunch visit.  Here is the condensed version and a new star rating.

Food: 5 (Delish!)
Service: 2 (Our waitress was dressed well, other Waitress inappropriate attire and the bad bus boy brought it down from a 4.5)
Ambiance: 2 (loud music, weird smell, and the heat)
Booze: 4"}
{"text":"I can't speak for this place on the weekends because I avoid Tempe like the plague, but I do say that I love this place on the weekdays.
The people: the bartenders are super cool and very knowledgeable on the beers they offer. Service is always super fast, even if it's busy.
They have an amazing selection of beers, too. So craft beer lovers, come play!! Happy hour pricing is on point too, especially if you want to eat some wings.
Also, plenty of things to do here, since I hate just sitting at the bar and having a drink. There's bucket pong, beer pong (cup challenge game), ski-ball, and rockem sockem robots...which are dangerous for competitive people like me. 
For atmosphere...they have a huge outdoor area with high quality patio furniture and nice lighting.
Also, keep an eye out for their Trivia nights, the people running it are really friendly and ask some great questions. 
Going back every week!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great beer! The service is amazing and the patio is too! Excellent spot for brunch, beer, good times, and great people!"}
{"text":"Spent a very relaxed evening at this bar. Very friendly staff. Their nachos are amazing. A plate full of nachos was enough to fill four people. The drinks and beers amazing. Quieter than most bars but enjoyable when you want to have a relaxed evening with your drink. I can go here again and again!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is new and up and coming.  The staff is amazingly friendly and the food is indescribable!  This is a MUST for anyone wanting phenomenal food, great drinks and an awesome environment!!  Keep up the great work Blasted Barley!!!  See you soon :)"}
{"text":"This is our new pre-Marquee spot. Well-curated beer selection, high-value and tasty menu, friendly service, welcoming environment and a surprisingly eclectic soundtrack---we heard everything from traditional alt rock to Justin Timberlake to my personal favorite, I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love Tonight by The Outfield. 

Perhaps the highest praise I can give is in regard to the service. Because we were seated at the bar and could eavesdrop at will, we learned that our bartender/server was working just her third shift. Given her command of the menu and beer list, not to mention a highly engaging, don't sweat the small stuff attitude, you never would have guessed she was so green. Great job by everyone at Blasted Barley. We'll be back."}
{"text":"food & drinks were amazing! the customer service was outstanding! highly recommend the bbq pork sandwich"}
{"text":"Get the popcorn.  Then send me a thank you note!  It is freaking amazing!  I don't know how I will deal with other popcorn now.  Blasted has ruined regular popcorn for me. 

 This stuff is like heroin!  Fresh popped and THEN...a substantial load of hot, crispy bacon AND cubes of fried pork belly, plus parmesan cheese are dumped on along with a little of the drippings.  Just typing this, I'm starting to feel faint and am hearingp porn music.  I seriously considered finding a way to lock my boyfriend in the john so I could hog more of it for myself!

Really nice beer selection.  Great happy hour with live music on the Friday afternoon we were there."}
{"text":"3 stars because the 2 events I went to were very unorganized. The first one, 2 host people had no idea what I was talking about, luckily a server came up and knew. The live music was also extremely loud, to the point you couldn't even hear the person sitting next to you.  The second event was during brunch (which they have changed to include more options now, from my understanding) from what I had read, however once I arrived (at 11) the tapping apparently wasn't happening until 12, which wasn't reflected online and we also couldn't have any lunch items until 12, the lunch items however were so limited that it just wasn't what we wanted at the time and everything except the bagles and lox had eggs, I don't like eggs, so I wasn't going to order any of those. Service was also extremely slow even though the restaurant was pretty empty.

That being said at the first event I had the popcorn of Sustainability and it was Fantastic, I absolutely love it and can't wait to eventually try other things!"}
{"text":"Loco moco w a side of French toast, huevos rancheros, and bottomless. Even not for brunch this place has amazing food, amazing beer selection, and great environment. Someone's service lacks a bit but it's always worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Food is okay, service is terrible. Waited around for 20 mins before anyone even approached my table. Then they were so slow to bring out the drinks and food. The entire time there was 7 employees standing around talking to each other. I sticked around to give the food a try, but the people at the table next to us weren't as patient. If they plan on sticking around, they better step up their game and watch their labor cost. No need to have so much staff on board if they're going to take so long. I'll go back and give them another shot at some point, but so far, not in my top 5 by any means"}
{"text":"We went out to Oktoberfest on Saturday night and after deciding not to wait a hour in line for tickets a couple buddies and I decided to just walk around and have a few beers before deciding to settle down somewhere and drink for the night. We heard this place had pretty decent food so we stopped in. We were are the UFC fight was on and with Oktoberfest we expected them to be Super slammed, to our surprise we walked right in, got a high top and were ready to eat some food and drink some beers. We stood at the hightop for about 10 min before someone came to ask us what we wanted to drink. By this time I had gotten a menu from the bartender and when the dude came up to welcome us, I had already decided what I wanted to eat and drink. I got wings, a buddy got a burger and we each got a beer and waters... Fast forward 30 min later... There was no sight of our waiter, there was no waters or beers on our tables, we were starving and I was super irritated. I told my buddies to lets just get the hell out of there. We joked wondering if the server even worked there or if it was just some guy that was messing with us. Long story short I have never waited more then 10 min for water, and don't like to wait very long for my beer especially when it was this slow. Mill Ave has too many bars that will be more then happy to serve you cold beer and warm food in a timely fashion. Ill be avoiding this place."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and had a good experience both times. Loving the food and beer selections. Brunch options are all quite good - we enjoyed the loco moco, breakfast nachos, and terrific outdoor vibe. This place has a wonderful patio area (dog-friendly) and clean (TV'd) indoor area too. Service is friendly, but a bit lax in certain areas. Please mention the specials to us next time, and bring water a tad more frequently please. Otherwise - really good experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Beer was great but being from Buffalo the chicken wings were terrible. Why do cooks always under cook them? The crispier the wings the better. Stop being afraid and  cook them about 5 minutes longer please."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for a quick afternoon drink/lunch. I want to try the caprisun, it's adorable! I've had the chicken and waffle sandwich. It's a large sandwich but good. I was pleasantly surprised that I could taste the sweet potato in the waffle and the waffle was sturdy but still soft."}
{"text":"Just had the most delicious chefs special. Kale mushroom and goat cheese omelet yum! And a Bloody Mary of course! Great food great service!"}
