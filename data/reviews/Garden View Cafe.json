{"text":"Everytime I go here no one waits on you and I end up leaving my tray and walking out. The last time was the same. No one waits on you and when they do they take about 10 min. just for one persons drink. The last time was really bad too waiting and waiting and waiting while the girl behind the counter just stands around ignoring us. I had trouble even getting coffee in my cup. It took a long long time trickling out. I assume it was clogged with who knows what? By the time I could get waited on my coffee was cold and very very disappointed again. If they had different management and signs telling you where to go for the utensils,coffee,soup and what type it is etc, and actually waiting on people right away it would be a good place to eat. They need to have HOT coffee too."}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop in Magee Womens Hospital serving Starbucks coffee, along with assorted baked goods, sandwiches, salads and soup. Reasonable prices, but the line is usually a bit on the longer side. Much better than anything you can get in the cafeteria and convenient. The gift shop has gifts for new babies and parents, although this stuff is pretty heavily marked up (flowers, stuffed animals, etc). I find it fun that they also have nostalgic candy like Turkish taffy and flying saucers. It's a fun place to grab a tea and browse around, especially if I'm supposed to be working."}
{"text":"The garden view cafe in the giftshop of MWH makes for a great place to get a cup of coffee during the work day.  I often run upstairs to get some Starbucks brew, and they seem to recognize that hospital employees are usually short on time, so they always have quick service! They have breakfast food and oatmeal as well as sandwiches and salads for lunch.  I can't say I've ever partaken in any, as I'm always more interested and in need of the liquid energy they serve."}
