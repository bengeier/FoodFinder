{"text":"We threw up the food was so bad!!!  First thing my girlfriend and I noticed when we got there was that no one working was smiling or looked enthused.   Our waiter acted like he couldn't give a flying f@ck and didn't ask \"how was your day?\" or any niceties like that, instead just taking our drink and food order.  No small talk whatsoever.  Waiting for our drinks or some bread or something while waiting for our food, but no, my food arrives before our drinks!  I see the waiter bringing other drinks and putting glasses away but he looked like he didn't care, which seemed to be the general attitude of the place.  My girlfriend and I both ended up throwing up after we returned to our hotel!!!  We were both picking off each others' plates, but I suspect it was the meatloaf, as it was cold on the inside. We got our food within ten minutes of ordering, so they couldn't have cooked a salmon and meatloaf in that time! They must have pre-cooked it and kept it on the warmer.  Today we are paying the price and are laid up in bed.  I've eaten at Toronto Tower and Seattle Tower many times and have had no problems. The Calgary Tower was the worst experience ever. And on top of things, I tipped the bugger 15%, when in fact I feel like suing the restaurant."}
{"text":"The view is awesome, food was excellent.  We enjoyed the entire experience.  I think it took about an hour to go the complete 360.  It was a nice way to see the whole city with great food and drink.  Server was attentive even with also serving a large group"}
{"text":"For a place that has an amazing view of the city, you'd expect food and service to be outstanding, but nope, it is ever so plain and mediocre. However, I still have hopes for this place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Sky 360 to celebrate our engagement. Our server, Shaker, was delightful, personable, and super helpful; he really made us feel at home! He deserves a raise for his level of service.   We ordered a couple of appetizers: the cheese selection and pork belly and scallops. They were both really delicious. The manager brought out the cheese selection and was really knowledgeable about the flavors and origins. We weren't all that hungry so we were going to leave after the appetizers. I forgot that if you don't order an entrée you have to pay the 18$ elevation fee, each. We were fine with this, seeing as ordering entrees would have been a waste. The manager then brought our bill and said that they have waived the elevation fee as a courtesy and a \"gift\" for our engagement celebration. I thought that was very kind and it made the experience even better! This was our first time at Calgary Tower and Sky 360 and I am so very pleased. Great job everyone! Thanks for the nice memory."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with 17 people on a saturday night, service was excellent, everyone was pleased with there appetizers/entres/desserts, all the courses were prepared perfectly and seasoned well."}
{"text":"Restaurant and view was amazing. Had the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, which was delicious.  The roasted chicken and risotto for lunch which was really good, the risotto was so good! And the okgangan apple crisp for dessert, which was not bad but not great.  Only complaint was the drinks. Had a Caesar and it was absolutely disgusting I'm 99% sure it was from one of those motts Clamato premade Caesars, and anyone who knows Caesars will know that is garbage, and for 9 bucks! Save your money get a glass of wine.  Other than the highway robbery on shitty drinks it was overall a good experience with good food."}
{"text":"I was really excited to be going here for the first time, I couldn't wait to enjoy the food with amazing views in a great atmosphere.  The food was okay. I ordered the \"seared rare tuna\" to start, and I was a bit surprised it was albacore tuna and not ahi. It was still good though! I heard their soup of the day was delicious, and it looked good!  I had the eggplant pasta for dinner that wasn't very good. It was okay but the eggplant was undercooked and was not appetizing looking at all. Overall it was very disappointing and for the prices I was expecting some amazing. I know I ordered wrong because the steak across from me and the \"lamb two ways\" to my right looked and tasted absolutely delicious.   Dessert was okay, we shared the panna cotta which was supposed to have grilled peaches but they looked and tasted like they were out of a can, and only two TINY slivers of the candied ginger that I was also excited about.   The service was good, although she did forget one of the items, and the prices are high, for some things it's worth it, for others, definitely not!  They also need to re-vamp the elevator because on your way up to enjoy an expensive meal, it really doesn't set the mood with the ancient and dirty carpet."}
{"text":"Besides the view there was nothing unique about Sky 360. Yes the staff were great and always filling up our water, offered to take a picture of my wife and I on our anniversary, but that was it. For the price of the food there are better restaurants in town that offer bigger portion sizes and better food. At the end of the day though this is where my wife wanted to eat and a happy wife makes a happy life!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a view that can't be beat.  Food is very good with decent portions.   NOTE TO MGMT: you need a policy for flash photography at night.   A table close to us had a photographer with them and was taking flash photos the entire time. When the flash wasn't in your face, it was reflecting off the glass.  Very distracting :("}
{"text":"Come for the view and the experience of eating in a revolving restaurant. You make about one full revolution during dinner. The food is nothing to rave about. I ordered the albacore tuna and risotto and I was very underwhelmed. Their menu is small which should mean they kick ass at everything, not the case unfortunately."}
{"text":"I took in this restaurant hoping it would be as exciting as the tower attraction... not even close.  Don't waste your time or money.  The only thing good was the wine, and even that was overpriced for their selections."}
{"text":"My family traveled to Calgary recently and the Calgary tower looked like an interesting spot to see. The regular ticket cost is $18. I was looking into the restaurant and saw that you got free admittance to the tower with a purchase of a regular entree. The lunch menu was much cheaper, so we decided to do lunch at the tower (just about $5 per person for the tower and lunch). The restaurant isn't difficult to find, but the door leading to it looked like an employees only door. We were seated quickly (we had reservations) in a quite section. About 10 minutes after we sat down, the hostess sat a very large family right beside us, when 75% of the restaurant is empty. The waiter was kind, very knowledgeable on the city. The food was okay. We ordered bison meatballs for an appie, and eggplant pasta, a burger, and seafood risotto for entrees. The food was expensive, but it includes the tower admission, so I guess it is reasonably priced. If you go to the tower, I suggest getting lunch as well (the restaurant spins), but don't expect five star food."}
{"text":"3 diners ordering 3 different meals and not one of us cleared our plates. I asked for hot sauce to try and salvage my pasta dish; it still tasted awful.   This place is good for the view and the servers were nice, but that still does not make up for the food quality"}
{"text":"Cold food ... I ordered that trout and the fish was cold and sausage was dry ! Picture was taken . Lamb was delicious and felt like the server was rushing us to finish our appetizers ... So I wasn't sure if that's because the main courses have arrived and they dot have a heater to keep food warm!??"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and smell of food is amazing. However I'm not impressed that we ordered a bottle of wine and instead got a bottle that was almost double the cost and barely given the chance to see the bottle before it was opened. Also the vegetable sides sound more amazing on the menu than they really are, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Expected the view to be great but didn't hold my breath for the food & was pleasantly surprised. My wife & I both had steaks, her the striploin & I the rib-eye. The rib-eye was fantastic, great cut of beef that was tender & juicy as a rib-eye should be served. My wife enjoyed the striploin but I can't say much about it as she didn't let me try but a bite & finished the whole steak!  We also had the duck wontons for an appetizer which was very tasty as well, a little on the salty side but great nonetheless. The dessert was ok, nothing extraordinary but definitely filled up our sweet tooths. I had the brownie & gelato, wishing there had been more gelato, and my wife had the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake.  Overall, great meal & view!"}
{"text":"Came here for my 1 year anniversary with my boyfriend, there weren't many people so the atmosphere was nice and quiet, it was snowing out but the view was still magnificent! Especially with all the Christmas lights. I ordered the beef tenderloin and it was delicious, it was very soft and very juicy, I'd definitely recommend it. My boyfriend ordered the veal and he ate it right down to the bone, so I assume it was just as good as my meal. The waiters were very nice and came by regularly to ask us how our meal was and to refill our drinks.  We had reservations at 5:30 and came early to go to the observation deck and it was lots of fun! Especially since there were barely any people. We went to the restaurant 10 minutes early and we were seating right away! Only thing I would complain about was the soup that I ordered, and it was quite chilly! Wish I had worn a sweater!"}
{"text":"I decided to take my family to the Calgary Tower for breakfast as my son had never been.   The views I must say are spectacular and if not for them this restaurant would get 1 star.  After we were seated(on a couch like chair that had rips in it) it took probably 10 minutes for a waitress to come and see if we wanted anything to drink.  My wife and I ordered coffee.  The waitress brought our coffees and then took our food orders.  .......20 minutes goes by with no offer to refill our empty coffee cups.  Another 10 minutes go by and I flag down a hostess and ask for coffee as no one is paying attention to us.  It took about 45 minutes for our food to show up and when it does the waitress walks away and we realize that none of us have any cutlery, again I have to flag someone down to let them know we can't eat without knives and forks.  My breakfast came with toast and I discover I have no jams as none were offered.  So again I have to literally have to wave my arms in order to ask for jam.    Overall the service was abysmal, but the views are great."}
{"text":"This was a lovely way to spend a Saturday night! Of course the observation deck/glass floor on the way up was a great start! We took a few photos and headed up to the restaurant.  The first thing I noticed was the curtain to the coat check room was half hanging open, light on, and there were some messy items strewn around the floor. This is right at the hostess stand so it was not a great first impression. There was also a paper poster taped to the hostess stand which isn't very appealing for a classy place. The hostesses were in an argument over the seating of a table when we showed up and one marched away visibly unimpressed. First impression wasn't lovely, but they sat us at a great booth on the outer row so we had a beautiful view and lots of space to enjoy! Our waiter was lovely, as was the waiter in the section next to ours- he popped by to visit a couple times and we had great laughs with both waiters. Service was prompt, wine was great. I had the special (8oz veal tenderloin with duchess potatoes and asparagus) and my company had the bison flank with roasted potatoes, green beans and braised cabbage. The meats were delicious and tender, potatoes were great, but the braised cabbage was not great. Our waiter recommended the peanut butter and jelly cheesecake for dessert and it was interesting and enjoyable. We stayed quite late for drinks afterwards (boozy coffee...Manhattans...martinis...port...more wine...) because they have a great selection of drinks and wine. The restaurant had cleared out significantly by 9pm so we felt like we had the place to ourselves! The waiters were great fun, and the view was just awesome. Could have stayed there all night! Food was good, service was great, and drinks were fantastic. We are looking forward to our next dinner there!"}
{"text":"Instead of paying admission for the Calgary Tower, you should go to this restaurant upstairs, because you do not have to pay any admission fee if you eat at this restaurant. The Alberta beef burger was very tasty, the roast beef sandwich was dry and not very flavorful, and the calamari appetizer was very good. The prices are expensive, but when you get to the tower without an admission fee, the prices are OK after all. The rotating restaurant  was a very nice feature, and we had window seats and really enjoyed the view."}
{"text":"We took my grandparents here for dinner, as it had been about 15 yrs since our last visit.  Service was good, but the food was disappointing and mediocre at best, especially for the price. I had the tuna, which came properly cooked, but had no seasoning, not even salt & pepper; the bland wasabi spaetzel couldn't make up for it, and the side squash was both over- and under-cooked depending on each individual piece on the plate. The rest of our party had the halibut special; again, the fish was cooked perfectly but was bland, and the starch on the plate was rock-hard friend chunks of bread - no salad, veg, or potato - very strange choice.   The thing that upset me most, however, was that the waitress overheard us saying that my mom's birthday was coming up, so she brought out an ice cream without us asking or mentioning the birthday directly to her. It was a nice gesture, but my mom is lactose intolerant so she couldn't eat it (Grandpa took care of it for her, so we did eat it). Then, when I got the bill at the end of the night, I noticed we were charged for it! Pretty bad service to charge your guests for a dessert they didn't ask for.  One positive is that the bourbon vanilla cheesecake was divine, and the view is obviously great. Pick up a free headset before the elevator ride to learn lots of interesting things about Calgary, but just pay the $18 fee and skip the expensive meal."}
{"text":"Plainly and simply one of the worst meals I've ever had in this city. We went to celebrate my daughters birthday for lunch and we took one of her friends and were subject to one the worst displays of culinary idiocy ever. The food is overpriced, underwhelming, badly cooked, delivered without any care for the obvious flaws that exist. Fish in batter soggy, pork tacos with burnt (and I mean past over caramelized but cremated) burger with a bun that had sat under the heat lamps for way too long. Seriously disgusting, this place relies on the fact that tourists visit and will likely never return. Trust me this is a Calgarian who will not take visitors there nor celebrate a special event there again."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to have dinner here for her birthday. Overall they did good. We all enjoyed the food, service was average however the view was 5 star. I would recommend experiencing this restaurant at least once."}
{"text":"Sky 360 is not typically my type of restaurant, but a request by my husband for date night coupled with a gift card that we received a while back lead us there for an evening out together on a random Tuesday night.   As we arrived early for our reservation, we took the opportunity to stop on the viewing floor. No matter how many times I stand on that glass floor, my knees are always a bit wobbly looking down, until logic takes over and next thing you know you find yourself doing a little dance 500ft above 9th Ave!   We were seated in a fantastic spot, a round table facing out to the window. The restaurant does rotate and it must have been a windy night as I did feel a bit nautious at first. The body does adjust however and we were able to enjoy the views - pointing out the traffic on Memorial Drive as we sipped our prosecco and avoided rush hour!   The quality of our food was excellent, although I did find the selection of starters slightly limited and only ordered a main. And even though we initially had the willpower to say no to dessert, in the end we caved and ordered a delightful creme brulee that did not disappoint. Sky 360 has a very convincing dessert menu!  Overall, this is a great spot and we had a lovely evening out. I'm glad that we gave it a chance and will definitely return again!  -- L"}
{"text":"My recent experience at sky 360 was disappointing to say the least. We came to celebrate my parents 25th wedding anniversary at the resturaunt my father proposed to my mother. We were seated promptly. Our waiter was clearly very busy so the service was fine considering that. Although the manager did have to get us something we needed. We were given our appetizers in failry good time but the real dissapointment was the entree. We waited over fourty five minutes to have our server com and tell us it would be another 10-15 minutes. After waiting that long we discussed with the manager who offered us free dessert as compensation. Once we finally recieved our meals we were horrified at what we were served. My fathers halibut looked like it had been microwaved and left sitting under the heat lamp for an hour. My tenderloin was order medium and came out completley charred on the outsit and well done in the center. It was essentially inedible and overcooked. My brothers seafood risotto was flavourless and my mothers short ribs were chewyand dry. At this point we were fed up and our eveing was essentially ruined as it was already 9:25 and we couldent even go eat somewhere else. Overall i am so dossapointed and very displeased that we chose to spend such a special event at this resturaunt. All in all our waiter was good and did a good job dealing with the situation but there is no excuse for anything else."}
{"text":"We were celebrating our mother's 80th birthdays. We left with a bill of over 350.00$ and we were still hungry after the dinner.  The Mediterranean chicken was like jerky and the veggies were saturated with lemon juice. The lamb chops were very good but the size was for a small child's appetite. Of course the view is fantastic, but we will never go back there for a special occasion unless the prices match the food portions and quality. The service was very good; however."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, service slack and it's very overpriced. Nobody looks happy to work there. View, as usual, was stunning."}
{"text":"While we were visiting the Calgary Tower we decided to have lunch at Sky 360.  The lunch special was chicken bacon penne. Which sounded awesome... but the end result wasn't so fantastic. Maybe the main complaint was that the bacon took over the flavour of the dish. The chicken was of low quality and almost had a hot dog texture to it. And to top it all off the pasta wasn't quite cooked enough.  The fish and chips was a little better. While the fries were a spectacular well done colour, they were still limp. The fish itself was nice and thick with a great flavour, but the batter had an odd taste to it.  The biggest complaint would be that the restaurant spun a big too quickly. You could feel it - not much but that is still too much.  But as the one person sitting by us noted, if you're coming to the tower anyway why wouldn't you eat at the restaurant since it covers the tower admission."}
{"text":"Dining experience and service were good but wasn't impressed by food or dessert. Expensive. I had chicken I think it was $32 for a single piece of chicken that was dry. 6 baby potatoes, 5 green beans all served on arugula."}
{"text":"Go for the atmosphere not the 360 burger, the burger was bland, hard to eat nicely and the bun was so stale it crumbled in my hands.   The view is great and you save admission to the tower. Wine selection is nice and waiters know their wine."}
{"text":"I typically don't give negative reviews, but this time I'm making an exception because I couldn't even get into one of the best restaurants in the city.  And this review isn't about the food, taste, but on the very first experience that everyone has when they first walk up to the tower.    It needs to be addressed because it is negatively impacting the image of the tower for guests to the city on this simple plain fact.  If the restaurant books up through reservations, there is ZERO admittance or walk-ins allowed.  For tourists visiting our city, it is appalling as a Calgarian that a restaurant leaves no walk-in space (just a couple of tables) for visitors to our city to experience one of the most family-friendly and great places to to dine at.  Actually, it's unacceptable. And if you visit their website, it says nothing like \"reservations recommended\" - the kind of tips that would help visitors and even local Calgarians avoid disappointment.  Personally, my wife and I took our 9 year old son out for a special dinner at Calgary Tower with no reservation.  When we came to the check-in desk at the base of the tower at 5:30pm, thinking we were early enough for the rush, we were told they were booked up and had no room. End of story. If I was a tourist, I would of viewed this as 'snobby'.  Hy's does this and it is an appalling client experience - surely Calgary Tower doesn't treat potential new customers as such?   Yes they do.  So Calgary Tower - always leave a couple of tables 'un-reservable' so people can experience the joy of dining at your wonderful restaurant.  And if not, update your website so tourists and Calgarians can adjust our expectations and 'schedule' you in."}
{"text":"I went here recently for a group luncheon. As we were a large group we had a set menu, with a starter salad, choice of entrée and a dessert.  The salad was supposed to be their take on a Caesar salad. What it amounted to was a plate of romaine lettuce, a little circle of bacon and 3 cheese shavings. While it tasted okay, I was expecting something a little fancier or at least plated more effectively. I chose the flat iron steak entrée. They informed us it would be cooked medium to medium rare. What I ended up getting was closer to rare but I'm okay with that. It was served with over half a plate of arugula...that's a whole lot of arugula - and nothing else. The steak bled all over the plate so from a visual perspective it was sloppy.  Dessert was a rhubarb mousse on a ginger snap. The presentation was beautiful on this but the ginger snap was hard to cut with a fork and made for an awkward eating experience. Tasty though.  The servers also seemed fairly inexperienced. One dripped coffee on a guest at my table. Another brought a bill for an extra glass of wine without a bill holder. Our event had two brief periods of speeches (no more than 6 or 7 minutes each time) and it seemed to be without fail when the servers would choose to clear plates, ask if more coffee was required or have loud conversations amongst themselves. Nothing terrible but I expected a bit more tact and awareness to happen.  From an ambiance perspective, everything seems dates. The wood panelling gives it a 70's basement feel. You probably wouldn't notice at night but during the day it is showing its age. The view of course is fantastic. If I had guests in town I might consider trying the tower again just for that, if it is a nice day."}
{"text":"A close friend was visiting from another province and I thought there was no better place to treat them to dinner and a great view of our city than the Sky 360 at the top of the Calgary Tower. My partner and I were picking up the tab and we already knew we were in for a bit of a pricey bill, but expected the food and service to back it up. The view was exceptional and I wish everything else was.   Our server was polite enough at first, we sat and they asked what we would like to drink, and showed us the wine/beer list. My partner and I don't drink so we declined and asked for water but our friend was glad to have a little something with dinner. We ordered a cheese and meat tray as a shared appetizer while we waited for our mains. The server offered to get us some alcoholic beverages again and we politely insisted we were not interested in alcohol this evening.   The appetizer plate was nice, but the main meals did not stack up to what I was expecting. The environment and the price on the menu suggested that we were in for a wonderful dinner but we ended up with three different plates of mediocre food presented in a \"fancy\" fashion. Just because you plate it up pretty, does not mean it is delicious.   Meanwhile my partner and I felt nothing less than harassed by the server who kept offering us alcohol. I get the first couple of times are pretty standard, but at some point you need to notice that we are not interested, especially if we directly tell you. If we require you to grab us any beverage, we will let you know. No matter how many times we insisted that we were not interested, it only seemed to make them try harder. I understand that they want our bill to be as high as possible so they get a bigger tip, but after the 9th time, NO. I really don't want any wine, THANK YOU. Please stop asking. I have never been so uncomfortable trying to eat dinner.   Dessert fell even flatter than dinner did. I was appalled at how lazy our desserts were, it looked like two of them were just bought from a Safeway, unpacked, and put on a plate with some chocolate drizzle.   All and all, very disappointed with the server causing us such discomfort through the whole night and the high price tag with food that did not match up. I do not intend to return to this restaurant again. None of us had an overly pleasant dinner. Great view though."}
{"text":"I went to the 360 restaurant to try their big taste menu in March. It's worth coming to the restaurant just for the view!  The butternut squash soup was a tad bland but it was rich. The lunch burger was thick and tasty. For dessert, I tried the cheesecake. The presentation was excellent. The cake itself was a tad dry. A good dining experience for the reduced price."}
{"text":"Bland den godaste risotton jag ätit. Mycket bra smak tillsammans med en bra storlek på portionen. Trevlig personal och fantastisk utsikt. Även om man kanske blir lite yr efter ett tag...  Min flickvän är vegan, och tillsynes finns det ingenting på menyn som är veganskt, vid tidpunkten jag skriver, men personalen var mycket trevliga och kocken fixade personligt ihop en vegansk risotto. Helt fantastiskt god! Om någon i sällskapet är vegan skulle jag fråga efter den veganska risotton."}
{"text":"Food was good, steak cooked nicely, service was a bit schmoozy but okay. The view is great. Pretty pricey. It doesn't warrant more than three stars because the ladies room was an absolute mess. One toilet was out of order, two wastebaskets were overflowing onto the floor with paper towels. I'd expect a McDonald's to have a tidier restroom."}
{"text":"Great view of downtown Calgary in this beautiful revolving restaurant.  The food is presented nicely, but food is not flavorful and service is so-so."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here... The view was spectacular and the food was pretty good (as far as I'm concerned) my husband didn't really like his dish ( some kind of fish) ... I also love the fact that it's kid friendly so I got 2take my baby girl with me , which was gr8. Overall , good experience but the food was a little 2 pricey for , pretty much , average food."}
{"text":"I give Sky 360 a solid 3-stars.  There are two facts which will help put this rating into perspective:  1) we went for a quick weekday lunch; and 2) It was a very overcast, cloudy day.   I think, based on other reviews, that coming here for an evening dinner on a clear day would be the optimal way to experience this restaurant.  Our meal got off to an awkward start.  Our waiter began by listing the specials for the day, which included a pear and blue cheese veloute soup.  It sounded unique, but his description of it was very negative... \"It isn't very flavorful, and it has this strange grainy texture from the pears.\"  Needless to say - we didn't order it!  I'm not sure how to feel about this - on one hand, I'm quite happy that he was honest in his description, but on the on the other hand, I'm disappointed that there wasn't an exciting new soup to try.  Two people in our group got the lunch special.  For $23, they got a choice of the butternut squash soup or a mixed greens salad followed by a main of either fish & chips, the hamburger or the Tagliatelle.  The butternut squash soup got a thumbs up, as did the fish & chips - neither was out of this world, but both were done right.  The soup was rich and creamy, and the fish & chips were flavorful and had a light crispy batter.  I had the Arugula Salad with Arctic Char.  The salad had roasted beets, feta, and chick peas in it which made it stand out from a 'plain' arugula salad.  The Arctic Char was cooked perfectly and was seared so that the skin was nice and crisp.  The restaurant was extremely quiet, especially compared to many downtown restaurants at lunch hour that serve similar fare at similar prices (especially since you no longer have to pay for the elevator ride up).  If you are looking for somewhere different to go, and don't want to worry about showing up at 11:30 to get a table, Sky 360 would be a solid bet."}
{"text":"Went here with family on August 31st to celebrate a special visit from our cousin who came from Italy :-)  Like many reviewers, the view is wonderful and the ambiance is quite nice too.  This all being said, the meal was a hit or two and many misses.  The full review is coming to a 3--because I am including the location, but for the food, I feel comfortable giving it a 2....sorry folks but of 5 mains and 4 appetizers....the appetizers and only TWO mains came out on top (relatively speaking since two of the appetizers were a cheese board and a meat board).  Given the price point of the mains I have to say, La Ronde in Edmonton is MUCH better in terms of the food, price point included (and it has the view too!).  We ordered the Radiatori pasta, Eggplant Linguine, Seafood Risotto, Beef Tenderloin, and the Halibut.  Of all of these, the Halibut and the Beef were good....I know, you are asking, WHY did you order the pastas?  I didn't :-) others did and happily (since we are all related), I got to have a taste of each.  The risotto didn't have much seafood and was mostly shrimp, the radiatori and linguine were more on the overcooked side and the sauce was too sweet.  The halibut was a bit salty but cooked well and the beef was also quite good and cooked well. Our appetizers were the Asparagus soup, Mussels, Cheese Board, and Meat Board.  They were all acceptable and we did enjoy them.  We split 2 mousse desserts which were good...  I can now say, \"been there, done that\".    In the end, it was about the wonderful company and being together....."}
{"text":"On a clear day in Calgary, a group of us went to Sky 360 for lunch with our families. First of all, if you want to see the view it is worth it to go and choose an entrée at this restaurant because they wave the viewing fees if you eat there. And actually, for lunch we felt the food was tasty, the portions were plenty (we expected small based on the view), and the atmosphere was excellent. Our hostess to seat us at the table was terrible. We waited a long time to be seated (with reservations) and as our friend said, \"I felt like I needed to apologize to her to eating here.\" Either she is having an awful day, or being a hostess should not be in her cards. Our server was friendly enough though. I had a local beer on tap, which was lovely. My friend had a wine that she was pleased with and everyone else had pop. I noticed that a lot of people did not rate the food as high stars, but for us lunch was very pleasant and everyone enjoyed what they were eating.  Two people at the table had the Alberta beef burger - tomato, lettuce, swiss cheese, breaded onion rings, mushroom,Canadian back bacon served with fries. I sampled the burger and the patty had a lot of flavour in it with a lot of things between the buns. The fries were hot and tasty. I had the pan seared salmon - chilli lime, wild rice, lentils, spinach, sprouts. The salmon was well cooked and not too dry, and  wild rice/lentils/spinach side was filling without feeling too heavy. My daughter had the radiatori pasta - roasted pepper, plum tomato, fall vegetables. She was surprised, being a teenager, that there was enough to make her full. \"I expected 9 pieces of pasta arranged on a plate.\" My friends had the squash ravioli - braised lamb ragout, cherry tomato and braised kale and the wild rice and lentil bowl - zucchini, tomato, feta, eggplant, sugar peas, sprouts, chili lime vinaigrette. Both enjoyed their dishes but especially expressed happiness to the sauce that the squash ravioli was in. Was it expensive...well yes....24 dollars for a vegetarian pasta is a little high...but considering the atmosphere and the fact you wave the fees going up the tower I think it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I was there the evening of  Friday Sept.16/11 with 5 other guests. We had reservations for 5:45 and were greeted and promptly escorted to our table. I should mention first that we arrived a few minutes early, and were allowed to go to the observation deck to look around and view the city. It was a good way to kill some time before our other guests arrived. (Yes, you get a free ride up when you dine in the restaurant) After all three couples finally settled into our seats, our waitress came over and took drink orders.(The drinks came right away). One of the couples that was with us, was from out of town so the other two couples were engaged in conversation. The waitress had to come back a few times to ask if we had a chance to look over the menu. I have to say she was fairly patient since we took a good 20-25 min. before even opening our menu's.We all ordered appetizer's I had the Crispy Calamari $14.00, and so did two others. Two others had a mixed green salad $11.00, and I can't remember what the other had. For Entree's Four of us ordered 6 oz.AAA Beef Tenderloin $40.00. One one person had the Herb Roasted Free Range Chicken. $37.00. All in all the meal tasted pretty good the calamari was good it came with a dipping sauce, and the tenderloin was cooked perfectly. The only thing I noticed was, the items that came with the steak were different then what were mentioned on the menu on the website. They need to update the website. Also I think I need to mention the fact that the person who ordered the chicken said although it didn't taste bad, it wasn't anything spectacular.(They wouldn't order it again). We spent a total of 3.5-4 hrs in the Sky 360 and did about 3-4 revolutions and saw the twinkling city lights. I recommend a clear night, like the one we had and you can see the sun setting behind the mountains. When all was said and done the total with two bottles of red came to $680.00.  That's without the 18% gratuity they automatically add to your bill for a party with 6 or more people. On a side note, the Sky 360 attracts people that are dressed to the 9's down to t-shirts and jeans. The waiter told us, it was because of the tourists that come to the observation deck and want a snack later with their kids. (they want chicken fingers). Also teenagers on their first date etc trying to impress.(VERY CUTE)"}
{"text":"Sky 360. You come for the great food and service. The manger Kutay was amazing at getting us settled in Had a client that did not eat meat they went out of their way to put together something vegetarian.  food is always great here the only thing is sometimes you really like a dish you will end up missing it as their menu change every 6 months. But you alway get an awesome experience here. Not to mention the view."}
{"text":"Top of the Calgary tower.  Okay this is a bitter sweat place. If you enjoy meals that that are a high level of English, it's great. I however need google with every item on the menu.  The food is delicious, and of course with the high class comes the high price. Also the floor moves very, very slowly. It takes about 1 hour to make it all the way around. I suggest it for really special occasions."}
{"text":"Very kind and welcoming Staff.  Delicious food.  Amazing View while dining.  One star off for the mark up of price.  recommended."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 5, each of us had a different entree and all had a great meal! We were enjoying our drinks and the view and hadn't really noticed the time that had passed. At some point it crossed my mind that maybe we'd been waiting awhile for our meal, but it wasn't anything unusual and no one had even commented on it. The manager approached us and apologized for the wait on our meals and offered to cover the cost of all our drinks (around $70 worth). The fact that he considered that before any of us really noticed, or had to say anything...fantastic!! We had a great experience and would recommend to anyone! Great food, view and service!!"}
{"text":"Well we thought we were going to have a drink however informed that the earliest we could be seated was 9pm. The place was empty. When I pushed the issue I was told that there was a dress code and they don't allow sweats. Told the hostess that she should have lead with that one.  Nowhere was it posted about attire.  The sign reads restaurant and lounge.  I guess there is no longer a lounge.  Hmmmm. Some underhand form of discrimination I hate to say."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Calgary and decided we would arrive right in time for lunch. Why not go to the tower, since we ate at the Space Needle and had a ball. We arrived right at 1:30 for our reservation and they sent us up with no delay. We got a perfect window seat. The waiter came over right away and took drink orders. I wanted just water with lemon, he asked if a carafe was fine? Sure. More on this later.  We were doing the $23 lunch special, you get a entree and starter of soup or salad. you save $3 doing this. You can add dessert for $6. I start with a salad, it was fresh and had a good vinaigrette on it.  Husband went with the curried carrot soup, which was tasty and a pretty large bowl of it. I had ordered fries with the burger, but when it came out, he brought another salad. When I flagged him down, he said, 'oh, you changed your mind'. No, I think he changed his mind when placing the order.    He took the plate with the salad and about ten minutes later, a huge bowl of fries comes out. All is good, once again. I am on my second carafe of water, since I am sharing with my husband, who is having tea, as well. As a note, I never got the lemon, my husband got lemon with his tea and the waiter jokingly says, maybe he will share his lemon with you. I laughed not realizing I would never see my little piece of citrus.   I think the burger is good, my husband, left half of his, saying it just started tasting heavy and greasy. I have a high tolerance for this, so not surprised, I powered through. Then we order dessert, as we are enjoying a great view. My husband ordered the lemon cake, which was light and very good. I ordered the rocky road brownie with gelato. I asked if it had walnuts and if so, could we please leave them off, as I have a slight walnut allergy. He said there is no way possible, they are baked in. Fine, I will power through for the sake of chocolate.   It shows up with a million walnuts on top. There were not that many baked in, but four million on top. I executed my walnut flinging skills, and I was fine with the little that were in the brownie.   The bill comes and the carafes of water were $2 each. I paid more for water than my husband did for tea. I have never been charged for water, but chalked it up as Calgary Tower fun tax. Then the desserts were billed out at $9 and $8 each. The lunch final bill was $76. This was more than we paid for dinners at the Space Needle.   At least the price of the admission to get to the top was included in that. The glass floor is worth going up. It is just a small portion on one side. I thought I was going to just walk right on to it, but no, I was like most people who froze right at the edge, as their significant others stood coaxing them onto the clear plexiglass of death."}
{"text":"We went to Sky 360 for my girlfriends 40th birthday dinner and we had the most fabulous time!  Not only was the venue breath-taking - the service made us feel extra special.   Our server was exceptional and she provided wonderful insight and advice with the wine and menu.  We shared starter salads and they were large portions. My friends ordered the Cesar which they loved, but we all agreed that my tossed green salad was better.  I ordered the scallops and they were melt in your mouth yummy! The pork was tender and juicy and there was just the right amount of seasonal veggies and little potatoes.  I highly recommend this restaurant for special occasions and date nights!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, beautiful views. They are so nice there and we had a wonderful time. I would certainly return. We started with the bruschetta which was delicious and was a great size for four people sharing. Then for my main I had the orecchiette, which reminded me of the comforting taste of beef and noodles with gravy. It was more sophisticated and delicious. The lemon cake completed our meal, we shared it. I would certainly return for the great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"You are paying (at a premium) for the view, not the food or service. Ordered the Alberta Ribeye; I'm guessing that the steak was let to rest longer than it should be because it was barely lukewarm (or my waiter just forgot to bring it out - hopefully the former), and as mentioned in other comments, the mashed potato was cold and really, really dry. I read through the comments before coming here though so I expected this to happen. I'd recommend visiting for once to check it off the bucket list, personally I wouldn't come here a second time because the price cannot justify the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"I only really come here with my mother during the teachers convention every year. I've never had a bad experience here, the service has been good every time and it's a unique location, the food is nothing special in my opinion. The only thing that keeps me coming is spending time with my mother."}
{"text":"We ate here on a weekday on our lunch hour.  The waiter was very attentive and the food was mediocre.  It was presented beautifully and the the views are spectacular.  The only negative were the female hostesses at the front.  Very biased and on a power trip."}
{"text":"We ordered the following:   Squash Ravioli - good, not bad but I've had better.   Mini yorkies - lover and would recommend and order again!   Lamb lollipops - loved them! And the pasta served with it was amazing!   Lamb shank - amazing! Fall off the bone.   Amazing views!   Chicken - ok."}
{"text":"The calamari starter and my roast beef sandwich with butternut squash soup were tasty and the people I was with enjoyed their dishes as well.  I don't think the food would bring me back again and again, but it was definitely good.  We came at lunch on a weekday and the place was practically empty, but they still managed to seat a party (with little kids, too) on each side of us.  I'm still not sure why some restaurants do that -- seating people within a server's area, ok.  Seating people directly next to one another, why?  I'm happy I went here and would happily go again, but it's not going to be at the top of my mind when deciding where I'd like to go next."}
{"text":"Food was good. I always get lamb at fine dinner places. Panna Cotta was amazing.  It was the atmosphere and view that made this 5/5."}
{"text":"Food was over priced and the value was absolutely terrible.  My wife order the stuffed supreme chicken breast goat cheese, wild rice, mashed potato, fall vegetables, roasted pepper gastric $36.00 and it was absolutely dry and not very easy to eat at all very bad actually.  The appetizer, The Alberta mezze for two truffle foie gras mousse , spiced pepper pico de gallo, artichoke and spinach dip, crisp pita, in house pickled veg for 22 dollars?  What an absolute rip off!  Pickled crap with burnt bread pieces? REALLY?  TERRIBLE!  Now the worst and biggest rip off of the evening was the Alberta ribeye truffle foie gras mousse, seasonal vegetables, garlic mashed potato (10 oz) for $52.00! First when I order the steak the waitress argued with me about the way I want my steak done I told her rare!  She argued and said \"chef recommends it being done a minimum of medium rare!  My response was for 52 dollars I want my steak rare because if they over cook it then it is medium rare if they under cook it it is rare then I am happy.  If I order medium rare and it is medium I will immediately send it back.  I know how to order my steak! When I got my \"steak\"  I was given a thin little crappy steak that looked like a 5 dollar minute steak.  It was thin squished and certainly was not close to 10 oz before or after it was cooked.  Looked like a 6 oz pounded flat to appear to be a 10 oz steak.  IT WAS NOT 10 OZ and I do not care what the response from the restaurant is I know I am right as I am 51 years old and know what a $52.00 10 oz Ribeye looks like! Go to Wellingtons or Hy's or maybe CHEF go to the bottom of the tower and see what Ruth's Chris Steak Houseis serving.  My steak was absolute garbage and insulting.  I will complain here but Guess what IT WAS COOKED RARE!  WHOOO!  You cooked a minute steak rare!  Bent me over and stuck it to me for $175.00.  Guess what Sky 360 that absolute rip off is about to cascade through social media and I will tell you now I will never ever be back!  Pay for the view?  What an absolute rip off!"}
{"text":"I have to say Sky 360 is one of my favourite restaurants. The food is always fresh, the service is great and the view is well you know..one of the best in the city.   If you make a reservation you don't have to pay $18.00 to go up the tower.   Lunch is awesome, not overly expensive, and you get great portions.   If you're worried up parking. The only thing I suggest is parking at the Core for $2.00 after 4pm on week days and on weekends it's $2.00 all day.   They've now changed the menu. Some of the new dishes are, Butter Poached Prawns (amazing), Beet Salad which is one of my favourites because of the cucumber yogurt dressing that has a tad of dill.  So if you're looking for a romantic night out or a quick lunch, head to Sky 360!"}
{"text":"This review has really nothing to do with service. Service was really lackluster, not memorable but the waiter was decent and deserved his 15% tip but nothing more. We booked a table on line for my husband's birthday as we had never been here before and it was close to his office. The restaurant on a Thursday at 1pm was not busy at all. We learned that the restaurant is open from 11am-2pm, it closes down and reopens for dinner at 5pm. It is open until 9pm typically and then later until 10pm in the summer.  The restaurant revolves once around in 45 min at lunch and it takes hour to go around at dinner. Fun little facts that I would be interested in knowing before dining here perhaps! The view was clear and high up and well, it was Calgary.  Hubby ordered a burger with fries. I asked and the burger could not be cooked to order. What a shame and a disrespect to the meat but rules are rules! On the heels of that question came out a charred and I mean, burned patty. The fries however were well seasoned, fresh and crispy. That was the only good thing about his dish for a $17 burger meal. I wanted to eat light so I ordered the Albacore tuna, BIG mistake. I had never had this before and it was ugly. So ugly, yellow/fleshy coloured and they KNEW that too so they had to hide the 'fish' under a bed of frisee lettuce and thinly sliced radishes and onion. I am not that picky of an eater and love all fish but I could not eat this. Who wants to return a dish though during a birthday lunch? My husband said he would choke it down and I ordered the soup, minestrone to replace my meal. I asked and was advised that the soup of the day was in fact made fresh daily. It was pretty good but under-seasoned by a lot and I had to ask for a salt shaker. Ya, a hit to the chef I know. It was what it was and now that I think about it, I was mildly annoyed at the time that I had to pick the soup and there was no fish of the day to check out as advertised on the menu. Our intention initially was to have coffee before we left but the fun balloon was deflated and all we wanted to do was leave and hit Starbucks. Some of the dessert choices looked interesting but, nah. A nice touch, hubby got a single little scoop of vanilla ice cream with a lit candle on it as a parting gift for his birthday. The bill came and to my surprise, the terrible tuna AND the soup were both on the bill when it was obviously not enjoyed and I had mentioned that at the time. The soup was taken off without delay and we left, likely never to return again.Too bad as had they passed the grade for lunch we would have come back to see the city from above at night. They will not get our business again, there seems to be too many other good restaurants in town. Charcut, we should have selected you...."}
{"text":"Doing the tourist thing and having lunch at Calgary Tower.  Great view of the city.  Ordered spinach and kale salad and roasted beet salads to start and bouillabaisse and stuffed chicken breast mains.  The food was all fresh and tasty and absolutely beautifully presented.  Service was friendly and attentive and Bobby was friendly and helpful.  And the view -  amazing way to see Calgary in an hour!  This place is underrated on Yelp IMHO as a result of super picky reviewers who have down rated this place for reasons completely unrelated to the food or the venue."}
{"text":"A 627 foot tower in a rotating restaurant is a fine place for a great meal.  Sky 360 is supposedly the best restaurant in Calgary, so that necessitated trying it.  I started with the Tuna 2 ways, an appetizer with tuna tartare and tuna ceviche.  The ceviche had just the right level of spice to it.  Of course, after eating at Isohamma in NYC, I found myself wishing I had some doritos chips to scoop up the tartare.    For the entree I had the pork loin and duck.  What a great combination, and both were perfectly prepared and very juicy!  Now, let me just stop here to dock Sky 360 -2 stars.  There were only 2 local wines, a riesling and a meritage, available by the glass.  And they were out of both of them.  I can get a nice bordeaux anywhere in NYC, so I like to try local wines when I travel to other places and this was quite a disappointment.  If you're going to bill yourself as the finest restaurant in Calgary you can't be having supply chain issues with local wine!  If you're running low, at least replace it with something similar until you can get your normal stock back in.  However, they earn +1 star back for the delightful chocolate sampler dessert.  2 chocolate truffles, flourless chocolate cake, and a chocolate mousse were the perfect dénouement for my last meal in Calgary.    If you're a foodie you definitely need to come check this place out while you're in town."}
{"text":"Decided to return to try the restaurant at the top of the Calgary tower for our 24th wedding anniversary dinner this past week.  I don't think we have been there since the change of ownership to Sky 360 (probably been at least 6 years since we tried this location.)  Parking near the restaurant isn't very convenient.  If you can't find street parking, the only nearby location is the Palliser Hotel parkade.  I hate paying for parking when you are also going to be splashing out for what is (ostensibly) a premium dinner.  Let's start with the best feature: The 360° views out the window as you slowly revolve!  There can't be a better restaurant vista in all of Calgary, especially on a cold, clear night like we experienced.  Drinks were good, but very overpriced, in my opinion.  They don't carry premium brands of tonic water for mixing, just Schweps, which is horrible swill to use in a gin and tonic.  My steak (ribeye, most expensive entre on the menu at $52) was done absolutely perfectly.  (Most restaurants in this city just can't cook a steak rare to save their lives.)  This was superb.  Garlic mashed potatoes weren't spectacular, if I'm honest.  They seemed a bit dry, and it almost tasted like they were not freshly made, maybe just reheated.  Which is too bad, because there is nothing better than garlic mash when it is done right.  Fall vegetables were nicely done.  Given the quality of the food, we didn't bother with dessert.  Overall, a somewhat underwhelming dining experience for such an important event.  We may try it again, but given the qualify of food, it will likely be another 5 years before I chance it!"}
{"text":"Really good food but if you get motion sickness... do not go here for dinner. Especially don't sit next to the window. It's a hard to stay oriented. :/ Great view though!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our anniversary. We chose sky 360 because we expected a fine dining experience. We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation and were abruptly told to go back up to the observation area and come back in 10 minutes. We were a little put off by that. I've arrived to reservations earlier than 10 minutes during busy times and was accommodated: that's what good customer service is. We went back up to the observation area and assumed they were very busy and couldn't take us 10 minutes early. When we came back down 10 minutes later the hostess was nowhere to be seen. Finally she came back and brought us to our table...the place was empty. I would say it was a 1/4 full, so it was confusing as to why we were told to go away for 10 minutes. Our waitress was incredibly mediocre, and barely came around to our table. We were hoping the food was going to be amazing seeing as the prices were so high. Unfortunately the food was also incredibly mediocre; if I am paying almost $40 for a pasta dish I expect it to blow my mind. It was a disappointing experience all around, and we could of had better food, atmosphere, and service at The Keg."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited the revolving restaurant many years ago.  This summer I was fortunate to win a gift certificate on Twitter.  We had the most enjoyable experience.  We planned the evening so that we would be dining at dusk.  Arrived at the Calgary Tower early and spent some time on the observation deck before taking our table for dinner.   Appetizers were amazing. Ceasar Salad has so much flavour and the portion was larger than I expected. My husband ordered the Meat Platter appetizer.  Pricey, but worth every penny.  Assortment of meats with bread & cheese, and serveral mustards.  Would order again!  My husband opted for the steak, he likes it rare and it came perfectly prepared.  I decided on the lamb - which proved to be the perfect choice.  Cooked to perfection, I have trouble describing in words how delicious it was. Again, both entres were larger portions than we expected.    For dessert, we decided on the homemade Sorbet - again the perfect choice.  The trio of flavours were the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  We stayed for approximately 2 rotations.  We were in on the Observation Deck during full daylight, then for the first rotation it was beginning to get dark, but still light enough to see a great distance.  By the time the 2nd rotation started, it was fully dark and we enjoyed the lights.  There is really not a bad table - each has a direct view.  Service was excellant.  With the order of an entree, the cost of ascending the tower is waived. Lots of parking in parkades close to the Tower.  Most surprising fact of the evening - how large the portions of food were.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 3 stars because of the amazing view and experience.  However, the lack of entree options and food was disappointing.   The server was awkward and didn't return to our table after taking our order.   The cheese appetizer was tasty, but the steak was mediocre.   Overall, I feel like I paid 200 dollars for the view and seat, the meal was not worth that much."}
{"text":"Wife, kid, and I had finally arrived in Calgary after making our way across BC, and camping in the parks. Despite roughing it, it seemed to us that Canada's high prices had been bleeding us dry. Thus, when I read that we could eat in the Tower and not have to pay to elevate, I was psyched!   We made our lunch reservation at the base of the Tower for one half hour later. In the intervening 30 minutes we were able to zip up there and enjoy the view, which is fantastic. The time passed quickly, and was a great way to kill time.  We were immediately seated when we reported to the restaurant, and we noticed just as quickly that the establishment was in motion. Like some other iconic tower joints (Space Needle), the Calgary Tower revolves for your viewing pleasure. This was very cool as we were new to the area, and it allowed us to profoundly take in the whole 360* while leisurely seated.  Wife and I ordered local ales, and the kid ordered a local root beer. These were served, we ordered food, and then things slowed down. We were hungry, so the 30 minutes that we awaited our food was just short of agonizing, despite the view. This wait time is the reason I'm giving the place four, not five, stars.  Fortunately, in contradiction to some of the reviews here, the food was excellent. My Alberta burger was nicely-cooked, with a tasty char, yellow tomato, pickled scallions, and some kind of mayo-sauce. I got the greens on the side, and they were fresh and well-dressed. Wife got the grilled cheese with Wagyu shavings. I wish I had gotten that, because it ruled. She also loved it. Kid got the NY steak and fries from the kid's menu. That was $14, but it was a steak (6 oz), and she liked it. She ordered it medium well, and it was.   Regarding prices, if you are going up in the Tower anyway and need to eat, then this might be the best bargain in town. Certainly, after doing the math this is NOT a $$$$ restaurant. If the menu prices stood alone, then it might be a $$$ restaurant. If you haven't been up before, then you should go."}
{"text":"For Big Taste, it's totally worth it to come up for lunch. Even if Big Taste wasn't going on, this place is a must visit. Why? THE VIEW! Normally Calgary Tower charges you $18 dollars for the pleasure of the view on the observatory deck. Well, go for lunch or dinner, and you get to check out the view for free.   For the Big Taste lunch, you can pick from potato leek soup or a mixed green salad, a burger, fettucine, or a blackened chicken sandwich and gelato. The chicken sandwich was filling, a generous amount of white chicken breast, juicy thick slices of tomatoes, lettuce and a spicy aioli. Fries were okay.  If I didn't have to work, I would have loved to have ordered a glass of prosecco or  wine. This is a place to linger and enjoy yourself. I felt like I was in an old black and white movie, so retro.   I would go again for lunch. Dinner is pricier, so the lunch option is better value. FYI, if you get dizzy easily, take gravel before you go up. It gets a little spinish up there as you rotate around."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner very recently, having just moved to Calgary I decided to treat myself to a potentially good dinner and great view. I had heard only good things about the restaurant thus far. The reservation process was easy and when we arrived we felt welcome. Our table took an extra 10 min to be ready but that wasn't a big deal.  First impression was good, however walking into the restaurant it is very clear it is in desperate need of an upgrade and renovations. We were seated at a booth that had about 3 rips in it, I looked around and realized ours wasn't the only one. Anyways our view was spectacular so that made up for it. The menu is pretty boring and over priced. With the average price of entrees being $35 to $45, the portion sizes were good however severely lacking in seasoning of any kind. It's always a bad sign when you have to ask for salt. The service was mediocre at best. The server did not introduce himself, there was no guest connection attempted. There were no recommendations or even an effort to find out if it was our first time there. He also never checked in on how we liked our food even once. As a restaurant manager myself I maybe a bit more critical of service but in my opinion good and attentive service can make all the difference to a dining experience even if the food isn't great. We actually wanted dessert but decided not to spend anymore money on a lack lustre dinner. All in all if we could get our $175 back we would take it and go somewhere else where we would probably spend that and more.  For people visiting I'd recommend spending the $18 to get to the observation deck as the views are gorgeous but when you are done go back down and dine somewhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing! The entire meal was amazing! I don't know what else to say, the menu was rather traditional and not as adventurous as I like seeing but that didn't matter, the short rib I had was massive, and bursting with intense flavour! My sister in law got the ny striploin and not only was it large, but it was in charge! It was the best steak she's ever had, and her father was a cattle farmer.  Dessert was so flavourful too that we were all blown away. The only thing I could dock marks for was drink sizes. Unlike the rest of the food it seemed to be the smallest serving size they could get away with which I found to be ridiculous considering the price tag on them.  Oh yeah, the view was incredible too! I always looked at the Calgary Tower and thought \"it's not that big or impressive\" but the views are quite remarkable"}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for the tingling feeling when you get to the glass! Lol! Never had this feeling at #cntowertoronto. Only at #sky360calgary. Came here for my UnicoHijo 18th birthday."}
{"text":"Not rude but certainly not friendly service. Had to look around for coffee refills more than once. Manager dismissed my comment that food took a long time. Bottled ketchup an uninspired accompaniment to potatoes for $26. One of my poached eggs was missing a yolk.  All in all nothing special and rather expensive for that experience."}
{"text":"I can appreciate that the Tower is an iconic destination for tourists, but there is a reason locals don't often go, the prices are outrageous.  I don't mind paying for quality, but out experience was less than that. $21 for breakfast which arrived cold, coffee refills had to be asked for, not offered in a timely fashion. Great views and a great way to see the city, but the meal is not the reason you go. Greater quality control is needed."}
{"text":"To break it down, I'd give it 5 stars for location, 3 stars for food and 2 stars for service. Let me elaborate. Of course, you come here for the unique location at the top of Calgary Tower. Views are nothing short of spectacular, and you will find yourself gazing out the window more than in your plate or at your dining partner.   Food is, well, overpriced, which is to be expected for a such a place, but it's only OK quality-wise. I had a soup and a pork belly dish, and both were good enough, but not really memorable.   But where this restaurant fails is service. If I come in to an establishment expecting to pay $100 or more for a dinner for two, I expect a classy, experienced, helpful staff. Instead, I got a girl, barely out of high school, unable to pronounce not only wine names but even some of the dishes. She was forgetful and hard to catch around the dining area.   So do come here, but don't expect much in terms of food or service. Just enjoy the view!"}
{"text":"Parking within the building so there isn't much of a walk. Food was a little more pricey but given that there is an $18 charge for the ride up you subtract that off your meal and it's relatively cheap for delicious food and an amazing 360 view. 10/10 will be going again"}
{"text":"I recently took relatives from out of town to Sky360 as my parents thought it would be a good idea to show them something \"unique\" to Calgary.  I have previously been once before when I was fairly young for brunch, and did not remember much of it.   Prior to going, I generally have not heard favorable things about the quality of food/service at Sky360 from colleagues and friends. Let's just say that this \"sterling\" reputation was solidly upheld.     SERVICE Our waiter, Zul, was at first fairly pleasant to deal with, but it was evident he knew he didn't have to work for his tips when he questioned my relative's choice of ordering her steak Rare. But this guy didn't just question it, he reacted with \"WHAT RARE???\" as if ordering steak rare is a crime or something.  I guess this is what happens when you have guaranteed Gratuity at 18% for groups of 8 or more - you really don't have to put your back into it.   The real fun part of my meal was when the food came. I, have also ordered a steak sandwich (a $30 dollar steak sandwich....), ordered to rare, came out cold and well done.  When I communciated this to my boy Zul (I feel like we have that kind of relationship now after he lambasted my relative for ordering something he didn't like), this is the conversation that went on:   \"Me: Excuse me, Zul, I am planning on eating the rest of this as I have to go soon and don't want to wait for another meal.  But I thought I should let you know that this steak that I ordered is well done and it's cold.   Zul: (grabs my plate as my cutlery is still on it) let me heat it up for you.   Me: It's fine, you can put it back down.   Zul: (puts my plate down) Did you want me to get you a new steak then? *in a tone of voice like it's my fault*.   Me: No it's really fine, again I am at a bit of a time crunch.\"  Feel free to call me overly demanding, but as a paying customer to a  \"fine-dining\" establishment, especially an establishment that advertises \"unforgettable food, an award winning wine list and a contemporary design all come together to make this unique dining destination a step above the rest.\" on their website, I expect their wait staff to be a bit more polite and professional.    The best part of this dining experience comes not 30 seconds after my exchange with Zul, when my brother in law finds a hair in his coleslaw that came with his fish and chips.  The manager that we called over (I'm looking at you, sir with a purple dress shirt and glasses), promptly denied seeing the hair in the food.  However, out of the goodness of his heart he agreed he will take the food back.  He did somewhat redeem himself in his role as a restaurant manager by removing the item off our bill.    FOOD The restaurant advertises the following on their website:   \"With the purchase of an entrée, Sky 360 Restaurant takes care of your elevation fee and entitles you access to the Calgary Tower Observation Deck one floor above us.\"  This generosity on their front is really a creative ploy by management to make up this difference in their profit margins.  These are some of the more memorable prices on their menu:  -$18 dollars for two crab cakes probably twice the size of a POG (remember those from the 90's?).   -$29 dollars for a 6 oz Steak Sandwich, which they advertise as the Striploin steak. It's a piece of steak with toast underneath. It smells and looks like a steak sandwich to me.   -$24 dollars for Fish and Chips.   I think I've said my piece on the quality of the food as part of my anecdote of the service received, so I'll let you, the reader, decide whether the food was good or not.   OVERALL I think for spending north of $400 for a party of 8, this restaurant should be ashamed of the quality of food and service they put out.  I get that it's a tourist attraction and they will always have people going to it, but to charge the kind of prices and have a wait staff that talk to customers the way I experienced is more than laughable and an embarrassment to the Calgary restaurant industry.  One time incident or not.    Specifically, I think this goes to show the amount of entitlement the waiter has when he knows no matter what happens, his gratuity is guaranteed.  While I will give him the benefit of the doubt on trying to rectify my cold steak situation, to question any order the customer have is unacceptable in one's role in the service industry.  Coming from a professional services backgorund, choice of words is very crucial to how to communicate with clients/customers.  This particular waiter can really use some coaching in how to communicate with people.   Ultimately, this dining experience really highlights the lack of ownership and passion the Sky360 team has on putting out a quality restaurant.  It seems to me the two particular folks would much rather work somewhere else than Sky360 judging by the way they communicated to us.    Unless they do a complete overhaul, I will not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered the scallops and pork belly ($20)  - came with one scallop cut in half and two small pieces of pork belly. Overpriced but good. Shared the Cornish hen and the meatloaf. Both were okay, not memorable. The view is amazing though so if you make a reservation for dinner, do it at sunset to make it count."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our time in the Tower and at the restaurant. Our 7:30 dinner reservation allowed for a 7:00 access to the observation deck. The timing was perfect as the sun was setting behind scattered clouds.  The menu selection and our entrees themselves were fine, but not overly exciting, maybe 4 stars -- but the service provided by Ryan and Emily brought our rating back up to an overall 5 stars. Emily was new to the restaurant, only her 4th day on the job. We recommend keeping Emily around as long as she wants to stay! Her demeanor and desire to serve were excellent. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, we got to go around the entire tower 1.5 times while we were there, great way to see the city!"}
{"text":"I was happily surprised by Sky360. After reading some not so great yelp reviews about the food I was expecting less but still expected the view to be worth it. Little did I know it was the other way around, I went during lunch and the view during the day probably isn't as great as it is at night given all the construction in downtown at the moment, cranes and half-done buildings aren't the most appealing view.   On the bright side, I got the seafood risotto and loved it (the scallops weren't that great but everything else was excellent). Word of advice, if you go to Sky 360 be sure to ask your server their favourite menu option, my friend got the chicken tacos and didn't enjoy it quite as much, the chicken was dry and bland.   Service was fast and friendly considering it looked like there was just one server on the floor during the slower lunch hours. It was my friends birthday and they brought out an ice cream scoop with a candle and chocolate plaque saying happy birthday which was a very sweet gesture. We went to the observation deck later and took some photos. It was a great lunch and experience and I hope to try it again sometime."}
{"text":"The rating is mostly for the experience. It was a good experience overall. Got to see good views of downtown Calgary. I honestly ate here because I thought it would be a good deal.   If you buy an entre then they cover the $18 ascension price. However, on hindsight I wish I had just paid the $18 and eaten somewhere else.  Like I said it was a good experience overall. I also actually enjoyed the appetizers. I got the scallop and pork belly, and steamed muscles. They were very good.  My meal however was not so good. Actually the general consensus at my table was that all of our meals were not it. The entree's all consisted of a protein, some starch and then they added a bunch of assorted peppers to fill the plate. Not to mention my fish was really bland. I guess being in the air sort of masked the subpar meal.   Nonetheless, the overall experience was nice. Just don't expect the most spectacular dining experience."}
{"text":"I was surprised that this restaurant does not give complimentary bread or mints.....even the Keg does this...the bread we bought was tasteless and hard. The black girl with the ugly pink sweater on was rude and gave us dirty looks.....the guy with tight blue pants and white shirt with a tie ran around giving high fives to staff...he didn't crack a smile either. Shitty service and the dinner was NOT worth what we paid-close to $200. We will def bring our kids to the tower but not the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Sky 360 realizing that I would need to pay more for the view. The view was excellent, the service great, the food was horrible. My friend and I ordered the crab cakes and the fish and chips.   The crab cakes were the worst crab cakes I have ever tasted. I don't think there was actually crab in them. It tasted like mainly bread. It was also overcooked and extremely dry. The fish were two tiny cylinder shapes pieces of fish that had been so overcooked the fish inside was extremely dry. My friend loved the tartar sauce that came with fish. The chips were good, nice and crispy, but some may have found them overcooked.  As mentioned we had GREAT service. Our server was very personable ad made sure we had what we needed. A nearby server also went out of his way to ensure we had all we needed."}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended.  5 of 5 - Fantastic views  5 of 5 - Comfortable couches.  3 to 4 of 5 - Service 3.5 of 5 - Good food.  3 of 5 Portion Size Visit for the views and ambiance not the food. Expen$$$$ive."}
{"text":"I can easily explain this. Sadly... the initial tone of the restaurant is hard to come back from. We had a lovely meal. Standard issue. We have been here for many many occasions. Big birthdays or special events-  The Tower has always been our on our hit list. Not cause its the best but cause there is something special about the ambiance.   However today may have sadly changed the course for our family. We arrived tonight for my mother's 70th birthday. Initially we thought my 9 year old would be at a dance event but that changed and our party of 5 became 6. No big deal you would think. Especially when adding a 9 year old to a table that already had a 5 year old.  Well sadly.... not sure what kind of training the hostess had but she was rude. She made it like it was a big deal. She went on that she would have to change our reservation - it was for 6:00 and it was 5:55 at this point - to 6:15 or 6:30. And then she went on about there would be a 18%gratuity added to the bill no matter what.   Ok so no big deal on the grat but c'mon - you can probably say it a different way but adding one 9 year old to a family table you have to make a big deal about the time and changing it etc. My parents stood there embarrassed. It was (as i mentioned) a special birthday. 70!!! And here this millennial with her long finger nail points at us at that we can go up but we'll have to wait. . .. prob 15 mins at least for them to get us a table.   From that description you are thinking - WOW THE TOWER is HOPPIN TONIGHT. omg. Hard to squeeze in a 9 year old. mother ship what have we gotten ourselves into. Sounds like a rave....  So. We go up. Im fuming. We arrive at coat check at little Ms B is clearly on the phone with the hostess here cause you could tell by her cool nature she expected us to be a pain in the ass. Yah. We are a pain all right. Typical husband. Wife. 9 year old. 5 year old and gramma and grandpa ... typical nightmare. . .   So the hostess... 'how are we tnight'.  Hopefully better soon I say.  Oh why. She said all surprisingly. I said well the girl downstairs seemed to have an issue adding a child to the reservation. She starts to say something but really what excuse can she and she sort of stops and says .. well i have a great table for you.   So thats how what was suppose to he a lovely evening at the Tower started. Hard to come back from such Rudeness.    So we walk to our table. You are expecting a mosh pit right cause you cant squeeze in a 9 year old.   Tables everywhere. Empty.  There was a couple next to us. Then 2 free tables. Then a couple. Then about 5 free tables. It is after all 6:00 ( and she thankfully didn't make us wait to 6:15).   We did sat. And we all tried to shake it off. Ordered a bottle of wine. And some appys. I had the fish special -Arctic Char and it was nice. Not overly flavourful and on a huge bed of quinoa but made for a nice meal.   Kids meals don't include a drink or dessert which i always find funny yet for a special occasion Im ok with the $4.25 Shirley Temple and the $6 ice cream on top of the $10 butter pasta. (If you are following along we just paid $20 for our 5 year old to eat)   And honestly. None of that bothers me. Our waiter was lovely. And the bill was just shy of $400 for the 6 of us.   It was that girl at the beginning that made a big deal and embarrassed us all. Went on about the grat (further embarrassed my parents that felt this was kinda pricey) and made it like i messed up when plans change.   So. Sadly. For that kind of money-Im happy to have the ambiance somewhere else where we feel appreciated.  We wont be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and it was better than expected. We started with the short rib yorkies and butternut ravioli. Both were good. Followed up with lamb lollipops, lamb shank and chicken stuffed with goat cheese. The lamb dishes were good. However the chicken dry."}
{"text":"Didn't really like the food. I thought it was overpriced. I love how it goes around. The staff were polite and offered many things. Clean place which is the most important factor. After Calgary is more developed, the view will be more spectacular."}
{"text":"I've dined at the Sky 360 4 times over the last 10 years.  I'd like to start by saying the highlight of this dining experience is always the view.  They've recently changed the menu and I guess the kitchen....  I had the $36 roasted chicken.  The chicken was appeared as a very tiny piece of meat which almost bore the appearance of a chicken wing.  Although moist and well prepared, this was hardly a full entree as it amounted to the protein content of two chicken wings.   I'm not sure if this is a new trend but I prefer when ordering simple chicken to be given enough to fill the standard adult.     The funny thing is that there might be a run on chicken prices for Sky 360 - here is another hint that might be the case:    My date asked for linguine and clams with a chicken substitution due to allergy.  We were told there might be an additional charge.  As the dish was $38, I was curious as to my lack of chicken and my date being informed the chicken would push the pasta to over $38...They informed us later that the price would be generously kept at the $38 because the chef was in a good mood.  Service was alright although there were some large gaps between ending our meal and receiving dessert (40 minutes).  If you are in the mood for chicken, I'd go to Earls for their much more generous blackened Cajun chicken and then head to Sky 360 for dessert."}
{"text":"Really great view while consuming food and drink. I came in for lunch as I was in a conference down the road. I had eaten at the steakhouse at the base and was pleased with that experience. I was told to the $18 fee to get to the top was included in the dining experience. I went in and was followed by others from the conference. We all got in line to talk to the chick behind the counter. I made my res for 1 and was told I could order from the entree list and price of the lift would be included. False. All items on the menu includes the fee for the lift. I could have just ordered a salad if I wanted to. Shame shame.   I already did a menu perusal beforehand and wanted the grilled cheese with wagyu beef, only because I read it in a manga and wanted to try wagyu. Thinly shaved, grilled with red onions and cheese, and a side of cranberry ground mustard made this a perfect lunch. I ordered a syrah from some town in Canada. I can't remember the name, but it was good. The service was nice, she was a real sweet girl. I went up to the observation deck after lunch and found it not worth it since it doesn't spin and doesn't have as much window space as the restaurant. Odd. Restaurant at 510' and 525' at the deck."}
{"text":"The food was relatively good, I had the braised chicken leg with some assorted veggies and potatoes. It was alright. The chicken was tender and juicy in some areas then dry in others. My friends both had the confit chicken sandwich which was alright too.   The four stars are mainly because of the great view and the waitress was still very nice even though we came in close to the closing lunch time!"}
{"text":"I took my parents here for Sunday brunch. The ladies on the ground floor came off pretentious and inauthentically friendly. Perhaps it was their age. Same with the hostesses. The restaurant was pretty much empty but it still took our server 10 minutes to greet us and offer us drinks. They seemed more interested in mingling at their stations than serving their patrons. The glasses were dirty, which really turned me off. Food was alright and showed up promptly since we were there around opening time. I had the rocky mtn breakfast; Splumbo sausages and hash browns were burnt. My parents both had the pancakes, and had no concerns there. Overall the experience was mediocre. I'd only return if I had another out of town visitor like my parents - just for the experience and views. Food and service is nothing special."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for Sunday brunch when we were passing through Calgary, We went rather early (11 AM) and got good service and excellent food. I wasn't wowed by the lunch selection by the eggs Benedict on top of crab cakes was great.  My husband had the veggie eggs Benedict and really liked it too. We went on a clear day, so that was a plus. And afterwards we went up to check out the view from the glass floor. As others said, there is no charge to take the elevator up to the restaurant if you have reservations, but if you decide to eat while you are on top, there is no refund for the elevator ride. I felt we got a good meal for the price, and i would go back again."}
{"text":"Our family celebrated a special occasion here.  The revolving restaurant gave us a really nice view of the city and the food was enjoyable as well. I would say the food was decent here, much better than what I expected for sure. They were well executed, flavourful, nicely presented and had good portion sizes.we got the chicken breast, the seafood risotto and the salmon. Would recommend them all.  The server was way too talkative though, like, I have no interest in his personal life, but he kept on talking about himself. It was a celebration of OUR family occasion, we wanted to savour OUR moments, not his.  Other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Boyfriend took me here for a date and we went around the observatory before our dinner resercation.. it was such a cool concept of a rotating restaurant and our server Noel (she's a girl) was very accommodating and nice. The food was very good, nothing extravagant but definitely worth it. I recommend going with a special someone or family! Would have been better if we stayed later and watched the sun go down and the city lights come up but its summer so the sun came down really late."}
{"text":"I had an amazing time at the top of the tower. Me and my fiancee went during Globalfest hoping to see fireworks. But alas it was not meant to be.   Food was top notch. The waiters were amazing and super helpful. The waiter that served us gave some really good recommendations as far as desserts and entrees.  I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Our first time in, group of 3 this evening. Not busy here and service was a bit slow considering that. We all had a glass of wine, or 2 and other drinks. Again, kinda slow. Had to ask for salt/pepper, no bread items, but maybe not customary here. I had a pistachio cheesecake dessert first. Pretty slow to arrive, but was beautiful and actually quite good, and unusual. Beauty presentation, as was all the food items. Also had an app that was good. Can't recall exactly, but may have been a tuna tartar thing. One guest had a steak and mashed potatoes. Meat was thin cut but he said real good. One guest had 2 dishes of crab cakes, which I tasted, and were good. His other dish was a meatball thing. I had the halibut. Serving sizes were small but beautiful presentations. They all actually proved to be adequate size. Nothing amazing here but pretty good overall. Probably would not return."}
{"text":"The place is absolutely amazing the place at night looks beautiful, but when it comes to the food it definitely ordinary nothing special with the price your paying I guess you're paying more for that view than for the food. So come here for the view not the food."}
{"text":"Sky 360 holds the monopoly on the \"restaurant at the top of a tower with a crazy great view of the city\", and without any competition, it's not a surprise that it's really gone downhill over the last several years.   The décor in the restaurant is passé, which is not a big deal - but is it too much to ask that at least it is well maintained? The wood paneling along the sides of the rotating section is literally falling apart, with a few spots shoddily patched up with - I kid you not - duct tape applied willy nilly.   The menu is overpriced and unoriginal, which considering it's literally at the top of a tower, can definitely be excused if the quality was at least decent. I've visited several times over the last 5 years and I've never had a \"wow, this is bad\" experience until last weekend.   I visited for lunch, and I went for something simple and ordered a burger. It was $24, and was served with a soup. The tomato soup that it came with can hardly be called that - it had the slurry-like consistency of a warmed up V8 drink, and was so acidic it literally burned my mouth and made me pucker my lips just thinking about it. The burger itself was served watery - the meat was dry on the inside and watery on the outside. Instead of a decent bun, the burger was served on a bun that looked it came from a discount bin at a supermarket. It wasn't seasoned, and there wasn't much flavor to the burger - the only saving grace was the cheese mushroom melted on the patty.   My friend and both ordered burgers, which is such a simple item to prepare. The restaurant was pretty empty but it still was a solid 35 minute wait.   If I had the option to go elsewhere for a roof-top view, I would, but because this is the only place, everytime I have a visitor from out of town I will probably find myself paying too much for something that doesn't taste great.   At least there's a view, right?"}
{"text":"\"JUST SAY NO.\"  If you want the experience of the tower, go to the observation deck and save yourself the trouble of the mediocre food and awful service of this \"diner in the sky.\" For our reservation, we requested a seat close to the window. Upon arrival, we were seated at a tiny two top in the middle of the walkway with empty booths and large window seating readily available all around us. Indeed, we even watched as another party of two was seated at one of these spacious window seats 10 minutes after we arrived. Our table, apart from being in the middle of the foot traffic, was tiny and designed for cocktail consumption, not a full dinner. We requested to be moved, but were told that all seating was preassigned. And yet, throughout the initial part of dinner, we observed empty large tables and other parties of two being seated elsewhere. Then, a party of three sat next to us and requested to be moved, which they were, immediately, to a table FOR 6! Then, and only then were we re seated. It is beyond comprehension why we simply could not relocate in the first place. However, we were finally moved, so I suppose it worked out. We  are not normally picky, whiny diners but this experience was inexplicably sub-par. Perhaps McDonald's might have better customer service than this \"olive garden in the sky.\" Also, the hostess could use a pair of pants or a skirt that does not belong at a place of ill repute."}
{"text":"We went in and made a lunch reservation that morning and they gave us a 2:00pm time slot. The tower was right across the street from my hotel and my elevator was slow so I ran across the street arriving at 2:05. They would not seat us! Talk about brutal. They were unbelievably rude. I cannot recommend this restaurant nor the service. I would advise others to skip the sky tower if your trying to enjoy Calgary."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary, we decided to have lunch at Sky 360 to enjoy the 360 degree view, like we had done in other major cities. Once seated, we realized that our view did not change. When asking the waitress about this, she replied \"oh, our floor is broken\" (should we not have been informed about this before going up??). In spite of this, we decided to stay, ordered the hamburger WITHOUT mayonnaise. Once it arrived, I checked the top bun for mayonnaise. Not seeing any, I started to eat. It was not long before I tasted mayonnaise. Again I checked and discovered much of it. Trying to scrape it off the bun and lettuce did not work very well. When I complained to the waitress, she shrugged her shoulders, offered a \"sorry\" and insisted that she had told the chef to leave off the mayo, Obviously, I could not finish the hamburger. It was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I have to say if you are visiting Calgary then you must come here and eat at least once. We came and sat down for dinner. Just buy an entrée and it includes the ride up to the Calgary Tower. The ride up to the Calgary Tower is $18 and an entrée ranges from $36 to $46. So take the $18 off the entrée technically only cost $20. Not bad. Also the plate is huge. It may not be the best tasting dish but people dine here for the view and not really for the food.   So the portion is huge. I got a braise short rib with ravioli and it came with two braise short rib and lots of ravioli. I also tried the chocolate cheese cake and lavender crème brulee. So the short rib was a bit too salty but its probably because they added the sea salt on top. I mean there is no need for the sea salt. The short rib has enough flavor for it already. The brocolini was very tough and too much fiber. I think they were over riped. The ravioli no complaints here. They were good.  My favorite are their desserts to complete the meal. So the desserts were done right. very delicious. Best part is that we caught the sunset here and also the fireworks during the Stampede. We were told that the fireworks are so so here and I have to say that is a lie. The fireworks was awesome. We were able to see the grounds of the firework. I don't know what they were talking about to watch it at Scotman's Hill and not here. Forget about Scotman's Hill. At least there are no crazy traffic here.   Also to dine here, you have to be seated before 10pm. Also make sure you make reservation a day in advance. Tables book up very quick."}
{"text":"Dined here over the weekend, thought the change was great. Posh seating, inimate curved booths facing the view, swanky new lighting...love the new look.  The menu has changed as well, although the prices has not. Still fairly expensive, but food quality was great. We shared appies, and I got to taste everything. Mussels were really good, calamari was chewy and so tasty! I had the Paella and few bites of everyone else's steaks and risotto, everything was tasty, came while it was hot, and it good portions. Some of us had to pack the rest of our meals to go.  Overall very pleased with the food. (The old tower restaurant food was always dissapointing).  Service was good, and they certainly tolerated our rowdy intoxicated state.They have a new fun cocktail/cosmo drink list too."}
{"text":"Too much hype for what it really is. The views are amazing, especially with sunset or night life, it's great don't get me wrong. The food is subpar, I got a steak that was medium rare and it was more well done then anything. They don't know how to cook steak. I ordered desert and I wish I didn't. So disappointed, wasn't good, very bland. The drinks are okay, okay selection as well. I just wasn't feeling the food, drinks or service when I was here, the view is the only reason why I stayed tbh. It's expensiv for just a view. Enjoy as you please."}
{"text":"The ambiance, the phenomenal food, the great view of the city and the wonderful staff makes this place an amazing place for a great meal.   While visiting Calgary, my friends took me here and it was the best meal I had the whole trip. The meat was perfectly cooked and the garlic mashed potatoes were to die for, and I don't even like mashed potatoes much. I didn't care for the cabbage but my two friends loved it so that's just a personal preference. Everything was a little pricey, but that is to be expected at a place like that. It was definitely worth every penny.   It was a really cool way to see the city, and we went early evening so when we started the sun was up and when we ended, the sun was down and it really added to the ambiance.   Our server was very friendly and very knowledgeable and gave me an excellent wine pairing with my dish. She was present without being overbearing.   Ultimately, this is a great place to bring someone on an anniversary, though I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to see the city and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Of many a tower-based restaurants, Calgary' Sky 360 wins my positive opinion. Not that it is particularly impressive in anything, but overall it is just so comfortable and warm - I really enjoyed my visit there.  As it is a major tourist attraction, you should be obviously prepared to pay. But that money would not be wasted in a lousy \"but this is the only tower restaurant in the whole town!\" You will actually get a decent service and a well-prepared food and wine. Atmosphere is cozy and the view is cute.  Poor Calgary Tower is somehow handicapped by the much higher buildings surrounding it, yet it looks impressive when they lit an actual fire on top of it, proving that the tower used to symbolize an Olympics torch back in time. Impressive.  If you are going to leave your car somewhere underground, you will find it tricky to find your way to the tower' elevators - so allow some time buffer for that. Otherwise there shall be no problems, and I am looking forward to visit the Sky 360 next time I will be in Calgary."}
{"text":"If you have motion sickness, I recommend you not go here!  I was here with my girlfriend for her birthday dinner. Service was awesome, food was comsi comsa. I had the steak dinner with vegtables and mashed potatoes (steak was a bit undercooked for medium). My girlfriend had the veal with vegtables and potatoes which was pretty good.  However the wine was delicious. I would recommend just for the experience."}
{"text":"This is likely the worst place I have ever dined for the price paid. The service was atrocious and their attitude towards good paying customers was despicable.   They have an imposed rule that you need to spend 35 dollars, per person, BEFORE wine or drinks. As a female that's a hard mark to meet sometimes. My girlfriend more than met the \"quota\" once wine was factored in but they wouldn't budge on her having MORE THAN HER two appetizers, she needed to spend $5.00 more dollars, or else. Who treats ladies out for dinner this way?  The food was pretty delicious when we got that figured out, but definitely left a sour taste in our mouths.  The decor is very dated and the rotation spins a little too quickly for anyone who has motion sickness issues."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of revolving restaurants so for our 4th year anniversary, we decided to go and try out Sky 360. We set our reservation for 7:00 but since we've never been to the tower so we decided to go early and check out the view from the deck. Entrance fee to the tower is free if you have a reservation at the restaurant.  We went to the restaurant 10 minutes before our reservation but we were seated right away. Although we were not exactly by the window, the table we had faced the windows and offered excellent views of the city.  We started off with soups. I had the Butternut Squash soup which gave me that comfy feeling all over. It tasted really fresh and was just at that right soupy-not-so-rich consistency. My husband ordered their soup of the day which was a beef and mushroom broth but there was really nothing special about it. We also ordered calamari which by far is the crispiest calamari I've ever had.  For my main I ordered Pork and Digby Scallops which is sooooo good! Crispy pork rinds, seared pork belly and scallops, what else can you ask for right? I totally forgot that I was watching my calories when this came to our table. My husband ordered the lobster cannelloni which is complemented by a very flavorful creamy wine sauce.  Our dessert, the Gelato Sampler came with a little \"Happy Anniversary\" chocolate greeting and candle which I thought was really cute (and yummy!). The flavors were hazelnut, spumoni and black forest. After having a teaspoon of each, I wanted to take home all three in pint (ok, gallon) size! They were all good but the black forest is probably one of the best gelato flavors I've had ever.  Although the price isn't really easy on the budget, I thought that the view, the service and the food were worth what our bill reflected. It's not that type of restaurant you'd go to for every day dining but it certainly is one of those places where you can get an excellent meal on a special day."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday for brunch for my boyfriends birthday. I've been to the tower more times than I can count but I've never actually been to Sky 360.   View was obviously 10/10, the spinning floor was super cool, but a tiny bit disorienting if you think about it too much...   Service was good, the hostesses seemed a little flustered and confused when we arrived, but we were seated right away, and our server was awesome. Timely and polite service, but not overbearing.   Coffee was good, the donut appetizer was awesome, even though the apple fritters were a bit under done. I had the hash and it was great, boyfriend had the 360 Benny which also looked delish. We left with full bellies and some leftovers for lunch today. Would definitely be back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ok - this is obviously a tourist centered restaurant, but, that being said, it was actually really good! We were not thrilled with the prices, but, I suppose you're paying a premium for the outstanding view. We loved the steak tartare - fresh and perfectly prepared. The prawns over pasta had such a nice lemony sauce I was tempted to lick the bowl when we finished the dish. We enjoyed our meal with a couple glasses of solid Canadian wine and were blown away by the dessert. The dessert was easily one of the best we've had in a while (and we never skip dessert). It was a light fluffy lemon raspberry cardamom concoction...I've never tasted a cake quite like it before, it was wonderful! Our server was young and a bit slow but very nice and enthusiastic."}
{"text":"The view is good, service not bad. but food is bad. Last time I was there, the calamari had no flavor. Last month, my friend and I went again to join a team meeting; we ordered a trout and short ribs. The trout was okay but the vegi and potatoes were super salty we could not finish them. The ribs were a bit dry for me. One of my friends reminded me not to order pasta once she found out I was going ... so ..."}
{"text":"Beautiful views, inconsistent food and we've been in truck stops with cleaner bathrooms.   We told the maitre d' about the bathroom and she shrugged as though expecting a clean washroom in a place like this was going above and beyond for them.  The meal was over priced for what you get especially the ribs, they were so fatty they were barely edible.   A fun experience for the kids but beyond that it isn't worth a second visit."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary last night.   #1 - smelled like poo as soon as you entered the bottom of the tower. Smell continued up to \"receiving area\" up top.   #2 - walking down a flight/2 of stairs to get there is kind of mental. What do wheelchair bound folks do?   #3 - seating was ok, but place was packed with families  #4 - we had $200 in gift cards and thank JEEBUS because none of the food was worth what we paid.   He had a $42 striploin that apparently tasted worse than the keg  She had a pasta they \"turned\" vegan as there are NO VEGETARIAN OPTIONS OR CREATIVITY HERE.   Cocktails were good, beer was good, view is well, it's Calgary - don't expect much.   Don't waste your money unless they re-do the menu, kitchen staff and quality of the food."}
{"text":"I was very excited to celebrate my husbands 30th Birthday at this restaurant . I had a reservation at 8 pm and I wanted us to enjoy the sunset views . I reserved this almost 1 month in advance  and made a note asking for window facing seating . Once we arrived , the person who received us wasnt friendly , she took us to the table not near the window and you people keep walking around you , felt like I was in some Starbucks cafe  . I requested for a nice seat and also explained its a special occasion I was there for . We were ready to wait but they were not considerate at all . I did see a lot of 4 chair tables with only 2 people seated . They said they will try and see if they can move us if someone left .We got our entree and then almost around 9:30 they offered us a seat change in the middle of our dinner when the entire restaurant was empty and the views weren't good enough . I was very very disappointed and the vibes were bad . The server was good and the food was decent . But the staff is terrible . I would not go back to this place . Please dont go if you want to surprise someone or want to celebrate a special moment ."}
{"text":"Wifey and I went to sky 360 for our second time on Saturday the 18th. We had an amazing view from the upper deck and glass floor and sat right before the sunset so we had the greatest view of the sun going down over down town.   As usual the service was amazing! Helpful staff, food came in perfect time.   The food was perfect. We shared some calamari and I (as usual) had the steak and wifey had the chicken. the food was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing!!! We love the portion sizes here! Perfect amount and you always have room for dessert!   We had the hazelnut tart.... AMAZING! You HAVE to try it! Perfect for wifey and I to share :)   We gave them a perfect rating because they always deliver a perfect experience every time!"}
{"text":"I had gone in to specifically try the new summer menu from Chef Schafer. Let's start with the atmostphere.  Sky360, literally the tallest restaurant in the city being 510 feet above the ground, is easily one of the best views of pretty much the entire city. As a breathtaking view, or just a panoramic vantage point, it's easily one of the best places in town for a different perspective on things.  Colin, my server, was quite attentive, despite my inability to choose between the 2 recommended dishes. Seeing a smudge on my knife, he immediately dispatched it and went to grab another. He was charming, informative and friendly.  As for the food, Chef Schafer did not disappoint. The experimental black sesame crusted halibut cheek was well balanced by the sweet mixed fruit salad that accompanied it. The Veal tenderloin was exactly that... tender. Served on a bed of enoki mushrooms and a side of goat cheese and potato perogies, it was by far an excellent dish to savour while enjoy the sights as the restaurant slowly spun. And the chocolate torte with the crushed honeycomb was the perfect end to the meal. Not too sweet, yet accentuated by the honeycomb, it was a joy to slowly devour again to the beautiful scenery.  Excellent meal all around."}
{"text":"Great View, A-OK food.  Typically when I have an amazing meal in front of me I savor each and every bite. I think I finished my meal in under 10 minutes. To sum it all up- I wasn't happy at all. My meal wasn't even flavorful. I just finished it to get it over with.  Unfortunately, at the end of dinner- nobody was raving about their meals. Which sucks since I was the one who selected Sky 360."}
{"text":"When you come to a restaurant like the Sky 360, one expects a high quality experience. However, the food had no personality just as the service.   Bland food, our waitress was a robot who didn't smile, even the ambiance wasn't welcoming and warm. For a tourist location, I get sometimes food isn't the most flavourful but it's vital for a tourist spot to have good service. And this place just doesn't. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best view of Calgary... Also, the food is very good. The beef carpaccio is delicious. And the veal is great!!... Based on other yelp reviews I ordered the veal and it was excellent!!.. My father had the beef and it was very good too...  The service is just ok. If somebody ask me their improvement opportunity it will be without any doubt  the service. With such an incredible place and the most beautiful view of the city, if they would have good service this could be the best restaurant of the city. The wines are great too!!.. And the desserts delicious!!.."}
{"text":"First time coming here, thanks to my partner for bringing me here for my birthday :)  This restaurant is unique as it is on top of the Calgary Tower - spectacular panorama night view as the restaurant rotates 360 degrees around.   There's free entrance to the observation deck for those who dine on top. It was pretty cool - standing on a thick glass floor. But as for the view --- it was the same as in the restaurant, so we didn't dwell there for that long and headed up to dine instead.   I got the Lois Lake Steelhead Trout ($35) - food was decent but not delicious. I think people tend to come here for its dining experience rather than the food quality. We chose a chocolate option for dessert after dinner. It was okay, I would probably try something else next time though, the presentation could be a little better too.   The staff provided good service as well - but because the restaurant is in a circle, sometimes it can be hard locating a staff member haha.     Overall, my partner and I had a romantic and fun night here. We enjoyed the 360 view as we dined at a table right next to the windows."}
{"text":"The ambiance obviously pretty cool - you're in a rotating restaurant. The drinks are very pricey! The food is average. I ordered the salmon entree and it arrived cold and overall bland. Food isn't worth the price tag! Really quite disappointing"}
{"text":"We had a family brunch here on a Sunday and were surprised it wasn't more crowded.  We lucked out because it was a beautifully clear day so we could see for miles, but I assume the view would have its own charm if in the clouds or snow.  Jamie, our server, was responsive, knowledgable and kind. He made the experience that much better with his comfortable conversation and sense of humor. Thank you! While our attention was turned to the view for most of the visit, I believe the restaurant was clean and easily navigable (duh, just keep walking if you get lost).  The music choice was a bit odd, a bit too loud and some very yell-y songs at times. My brother and I both had the hash and thought it was overly salted. The donut platter was fun but a bit dry. But the mimosas were grand and the ever flowing coffee delicious.  We'll be back to say hello to 360 degrees of Calgary whenever the family is all back together in town."}
{"text":"Best view in town and great surprise that they gave us a birthday little gift with a candle. We had a great birthday there. I like the Duck, it's very tender and juicy, the sauce served is just perfect for me. Wanna try their lunch with friends someday!"}
{"text":"Still as pretentious and under delivering as it was 10 years ago. Restaurant is run by a bunch of 20-year-olds think they own the world. Great view as usual very clean just way overpriced food for the low-value that it is."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars, I would!  I had an incredibly memorable experience when I had the pleasure of going to Sky 360.  It was a combination of the food, the service, and the general experience that made this restaurant trip so unique.    I've never been a fan of calamari, but these guys made some that I could tolerate eating; I ate almost a whole appetizer of this stuff!  It came highly recommended by the waiter, and we were glad we listened.  I ordered a spinach and goat cheese penne which was absolutely to die for.  Giant bulbs of garlic and a lot of pine nuts made it what it was... delicious!  I've never experience such a pleasant, knowledgeable waiter as the one we had at Sky 360.  He was able to fully recite the menu, which was newly instated, and every little taste of the different dishes.  I was floored by how yummy he made everything seem, and that he could tell me so much about each dish.  It was extremely refreshing to see a waiter that actually seemed passionate about what the chefs were serving.  He was able to joke with us, yet seem professional.  A great waiter by my standards!  The experience.  WOW!  What can I say about eating in a restaurant that not only has a beautiful view, but has a view of the entire city.  It makes about one full rotation every hour, so you won't miss a peep of the gorgeous city that stretches so far.  The best time to visit would be dusk so that you can get a lovely sunset over the mountains.  It was phenomenal to be able to experience that while enjoying a meal.  Sky 360 is an incredibly classy place, which explains the somewhat pricey items.  It's totally understandable to go here because the experience alone is worth the cost.  What a magical place!  And I know I sound ridiculous when I say that, but it's true!  Absolute magic."}
{"text":"Raw potatoes with the short ribs, barely cooked at all and inedible. The other dishes our table ordered were better, but not as good as last year's visit - I recall it being very good at the time. The view is fabulous, but the food and service is just OK."}
{"text":"Loved it! Seriously , a moving floor couple hundred feet up looking out at the whole city while you eat a fancy meal. I had the rabbit dish and loved it. Wife had chicken as always. Food was decent , I've had better, but was expecting it to be a lot pricier due to location and the prestige of it.   Im a poor folk and quite enjoyed it. First time eating a bunny. Never will forget that experience of slowly revolving around the city. Amazing. And great service. The manager even came by to ensure all was good.   A++ service. Not snotty either."}
{"text":"Food was average for sure, but my server Carmen was very attentive and friendly. I think it's worth eating here if you're here for the view. In addition, as others have mentioned.... So long as you order an entree dish, the fee to the observatory is waived :)"}
{"text":"Yummy!  What a nice surprise!  * We ended up here after our insurance appointment in the same Radisson building which connects to the Calgary Tower. Was walking past at 11am and realized that we have lived in Calgary for 3 years and never been. So in our hoodies and jeans we ventured up  Upon entering the admission, the girls working told us about the afternoon special - instead of paying $16 admission to the tower, you can buy a menu iteam and the restaurant pays your admission. They show you the menu before deciding and there was a veggie burger for $16 - needless to day we were in!  So we take the 80 second (too cool!) elevator ride up to the restuarant where we are greeted by the hostess who sits us at a comphy window seat - When we started we were in view of the bow building - when we finished we were just behind the bow! too cool  We ordered right away, as we were more excited to get up to the tower. Our plates came out right away  - the veggie burger was so good! But a little huge- but otherwise so good. So moist and yummy.  It comes with housemade garlic mayo and feta cheese. So so so so so good. Best Veggie burger that ive had in Calgary hands down!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to celebrate my daughter a birthday but we were shock with the food we order. it was terrible the salmon with gnocchi was so bad that I did not eat it, the salad too salty. the steak that dad eat full of fat inside not week cook. the pasta the girls eat was far from delicious. I am in shock like if the chef did this intentionally, not personal, but I am wondering if it was his last they in the job and he or she did not care at all! it was very sad since it was our first time there and we wanted to celebrate our daughter with a super special place and good food. very sad!"}
