{"text":"We went on a Friday night to start our night.  We were carded twice and they wanted to hold a credit card through our dinner!  The waitress said that was restaurant policy.  I am in my mid-30s and am way past the \"dine and dash age\".  The menu has changed dramatically since the last time we were hear.  The food selection is basically wings, burgers and pizza.    Very disappointed to be treated like a punk kid and will not be back to this establishment.    I'd suggest heading across the parking lot to Flying Saucer."}
{"text":"Good cheap bar food, they often do half price appetizers. Beer is cheap, atmosphere is good. Inside there are heaps of tables and booths, and for nicer days there is a small patio out the front.  This is a decent chain bar that almost feels like a local."}
{"text":"Nice antiquey (if thats a word) atmosphere, tons of tv's and a huge bar.  Would visit again!"}
{"text":"Stool pigeons is a straight up middle-of-the-road sports bar for me. I find nothing whatsoever offensive about it, and yet nothing totally standout either.   (Well, except  the Hot Italian Beef sandwich is pretty standout if you're in the mood for that kind of meat and cheese monster )  Don't quite get all the complaints about service?   I've never had an issue with service here and have been during lunch when it can be quiet and  during high-profile football games when it is packed.  Typically, I sit at the bar and find the bartenders competent but not overly cloying.  In short, it is what it is - a downtown sports bar, with sports bar food, drink specials and lots of TV screens.    And I don't have an issue with any of that."}
{"text":"Okay, I have to give this 5 stars because my sister is friends with the waitresses, and they are really awesome.    It definitely gets crazy on game days, so COME EARLY!  Like if it's a big game, come hours early.  I walked in an hour before one of the ACC tournament games and the bar was packed 3 deep and all the tables were overcrowded.  Being one of the awesome waitresses I knew, one of the girls put two seats in the middle of the room and brought me and my friend drinks during the game.  That is how nice they are if they know you; and it's easy to get to know these people.    The food here is good too.  It's good bar food that I really don't mind recommending to people.  I brought my friend here for his first sliders, and he still talks about how he has to go get them all the time.  I really like their buffalo chicken wrap because it's spicy! My other friend said it was too hot for him, so if you like it mild don't get it!  Another huge plus for this bar is that even though it's in downtown and people smoke like crazy, the huge fan above helps cut the smoke down dramatically.  You can't escape the smoke all together probably, but it makes it way better with the fans!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and we saw a waitress go by with a couple of huge pizzas and we asked what it was and she told us that it was the special: personal pizza with one topping for $4.99. When our waitress came over, we all ordered our own pizza. At that price, you can't go wrong!   Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but the pizza took an awful long time to come out. We must have waited for about 30 minutes before the food finally came to our table. But once it came, we ate happily and no one could finish their whole pizza. Definitely worth the money if you have the time to wait."}
{"text":"So I think this place might be better as a bar than a restaurant, and in that case I guess it was just a bit too bad that we went to the place for dinner. Not that the food was bad, mind you.  It was just meh.  Hence the meh review.  Anyway the problem was the same across the board - dryness. We started with chicken nachos.  Chicken was a bit dry.  Not enough gooey cheesy saucy mess.  I guess likeable for those who really just want chips.  We asked for extra salsa (and were charged I believe 50 cents extra for each tiny tub, woof!) to make it more pleasing.  Most of us got sandwiches, which sounded really good on the menu.  And in fact my philly style chicken sandwich was tasty enough... as long as I bit into a part that had cheese on it.  It was grilled chicken, peppers, carmelized onions and provolone on a bun.  But again, it was just a bit on the dry side, and there wasn't enough cheese on it to mask that.  One of my tablemates asked if she could get a dipped sandwich - the waitress seemed confused, so I guess they don't do that so much down here, but for anyone else who is confused that's dipping the whole sandwich into whatever juicy drippings came off of the meat on the sandwich.  Now that would have been an improvement.  Dipping is a bit much for some folks, but it would help the drought issue with this place. Bar prices were reasonable I thnk, so maybe come here to wet your whistle but think twice before ordering any food that should be served juicy."}
{"text":"This was very much like the bar and grills most college students frequent during their \"careers\".  I liked the atmosphere, it was very casual and familiar.  The food was actually better that I expected.  They had a create your own burger thing which I really enjoyed. The service was good.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us.  Overall it was good, but not really anything I hadn't had before."}
{"text":"Stool Pigeons can be a fun place to go.  We've gone a few times and hung out at the bar, ordered some food, and played the NTN trivia on the TV screens.  It's a fun after-work way to waste a few hours with friends.  The food is okay (nothing special to brag about).  They have your basic burgers, sandwiches, chicken wings, etc.  The drink specials aren't as great as other places either.  Wait?  Why do I go here? Oh yeah, it's to hang out with friends.  Stool Pigeons is one of the only places of its kind in the University area anymore, so it'll do until something better comes along.    For college kids, though, who live right across the street, it can be a blast.  They have enough space to accommodate large crowds and college kids aren't as picky as a thirtysomething like myself.  I know I wasn't!"}
{"text":"There have been a lot of improvements since I went here last!  Fifty new taps were just installed.  A new paint job and a new menu!  The food is awesome.  Try the wedge salad or the margarita pizza.  With new specials and new events, this place has really upped it's game!  Highly recommend for the next game or night out with friends!"}
{"text":"I disagree 100% with Devin.  The saucer is much more chill and seems to be less crowded.  More of a college meat market crowd, if thats what your going for.  Seems like a lot of the people trying to play pool want to act all thug.  Food is ok, I will not go back unless thats the place my friends are going."}
{"text":"If you live nearby and are looking for a casual sports bar to watch games and drink beer, Stool Pigeons is fair enough for just that. But beyond that, total Meh. The food is not very special at all. It's mainly fried, greasy traditional bar choices and the service can be good depending on which server or bartender you get. The customer service in general is not great and I've heard several people say this.   As Anish said, the bar is good for happy hour after work because you can literally drink and eat for super cheap. Each day they also have a $4.99 lunch special. Most people who eat here during lunch only order the lunch special.. so that should tell you something about the quality of the food there.  They do have a lot of TV's and it still gets a decent crowd during football games... but it is definitely NOT what it  used to be back in the day.   (Disclosure: I used to work here but this is still my honest opinion. I've held back some of my thoughts here actually.)  Bonus: they have a TON of good beer on draft. It's probably about 20-25 beers on tap and they change quite often. If you catch them on a special draft night then SCORE if you're a beer lover!! They also have a fun little patio and it's prime location for people watching too."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short - DO NOT GO HERE! We waited about 20 mins to get a beer and then another 1/2 hr to get our check. Asked a couple other waitresses to get our waitress, but she seemed busy elsewhere. Finally came with our checks when a couple of us made it seem like we were walking out without paying.  And btw, Flying Saucer is right around the corner and MUCH better. Go there instead. Seriously."}
{"text":"Sports bars are generally a dime a dozen and this Stool Pigeons ranks above average (for sports bar) for food, cleanliness, and a decent atmosphere. I'm not a sports fan, so I mostly go to these places for food and  fellowship, both of which are a good bet at Stool Pigeons.  I agree with Devin that Stool Pigeons is less crowded than comparable establishments, I've never had trouble getting a seat here. While the food is unoriginal pub fare, its cheap, filling, and pretty tasty.  No entree is more than $9.  In fact, the sandwhich and fries was a mere $7!  Our server was quick and friendly.  She got my sandwich right, down to the toppings and never wrote my order down...impressive.    While this is a bar, there is sufficient seating away from the bar for non-barflies who want to have a conversation.  I would even wager that the new non-smoking laws have made these sports bars downright pleasant!  Oh yeah, I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to watch my Tarheels get the crap kicked out of them by Duke.  Though the game was horrible, the bar was great!  Had a buffalo chicken wrap and quite a few Fat Tire drafts and I had a really great time.  The staff was attentive and helpful, the people were friendly and personable, and I was very pleased.  Will definitely be going back for the next big game!"}
{"text":"Another one of my old UCB watering holes, Stool Pigeons is a great place to get the evening started, watch the Sunday games, or settle in on a snow day for a round or 20. There are TV's everywhere, so you can basically stare blindly in any direction and appear less drunk. I've found the menu to be exceptional for bar food, but I preface that massive amounts of alcohol make everything tastier. The waitresses are always friendly, and have picked my friends up with dignity every time they've fallen off their bar stools.   Please note my first sentence above, which reads \"great place to get the evening started.\" You do not want to be there late, as the college fights break out, choke holds are placed, and the bouncers are just generally bitchy. Swimming in a sea of college kids is not my favorite recreation, so I try and keep my visits to daylight hours."}
{"text":"Cons: Worse restaurant experience of my life. We went to this Stool Pigeons on Church to watch Sunday football and were told that Mich Ultra and Bud Light were on special for $2.25. We're not picky beer drinkers, we would have enjoyed the Bud Lights just as much as the Ultras, we just wanted the cheapest beer because we were drinking a lot. So we start to order buckets after buckets of beer. It started out with 3 Bud Lights and 2 Mich Ultras and then the last bucket somehow ended up being all Mich Ultras. Well of course, when we get the bill, we find out why the waitress was bringing us so many Mich Ultras in comparison to Bud Lights. Mich Ultras were $3.75 a PIECE (not on special like she told us), which is absolutely insanely overpriced for a domestic beer anyway and the Bud Lights were $2.25. She was trying to get the bill higher for a bigger tip by lying and telling us that something was on special and it wasn't. I'm a waitress, I know how this stuff works (although I'm at least an honest up-seller, not a deceitful one.) The bill was over $100 for 25 beers, Nachos (which were not actually nachos, they were cheap veggies thrown on top of about 7 tortilla chips with tater tots underneath. Yes, tater tots. What is that?!), and wings.   She tried to argue with us about the prices and what she did or did not say, something about the special not counting towards the buckets? Who knows what the hell she was talking about, the girl obviously needed to get her info straight. So we of course ask for the manager who comes over to tell us that we drank them and we had to pay the $3.75 a pop. We were pissed needless to say. The manager actually ROLLED HIS EYES-SEVERAL times and was YELLING at us. I was stunned. He actually yelled at us. Funny thing is, I'm a business major, currently in school and we are learning (even though, common sense) that customer satisfaction is key. Had the manager given us the lower price, they wouldn't have even lost anything because we all know that a Mich Ultra in the store is barely more than $1, so they are still profiting from us. We would have been HAPPY customers, willing to come back since this is a regular Sunday occurrence. But now, we're so ridiculously angry, it was the worse experience at a restaurant EVER. The waitress and the manager were rude and stupid. I guess you can't expect much from sports bars like that anyway. Uneducated morons run the place.   I hope the owner of this restaurant is reading this. Maybe you'll learn something. If a SERVER makes a mistake, you don't make the customer pay for it. Even if the mistake is the customer's, you still don't make them pay for it. It's called good customer service. It's what will keep people coming back. Ever heard \"The customer is always right\" ???? (Even though we were, something like that would have never happened where I work) Now, we will not EVER be back here, nor will we bring any of our 10-15 people Sunday crowd, and we will tell everyone how awful of an experience we had here which will cost you money.  Congratulations, you just screwed yourselves.   Pros:  The wings were good..."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar... not all of the seats allow good angles of the game but it still not a bad place to watch a game... the food is desent... i would stick to the fried stuff and bar food... they have good drink specials and alot of TVs...  Had a few too many wasted nights in this place..."}
{"text":"After work place for a beer (decent number of drafts) and some bar grub.  Had some fairly decent Mahi tacos.  Service was good, which should be expected but is above par for the area.    Lots of TVs.  Way off topic but not used to hearing about pigeons, reminds me of that rap song that was a take on Scrubs... a pigeon is a girl who be walking by..."}
{"text":"When Im in the mood for bar food I pop in for a beer and their buffalo chicken wrap and pretty decent chili Yum!  They also do full menu takeout for when you don't feel like the bar scene..."}
{"text":"It can get really crowded on game days, but it's a fun venue to hang out and watch games. Weeknights are better than weekends, when all of uptown is kind of a mess, but it's a safe spot for a good night out regardless of the crowd. Since they get so slammed, the servers are pretty competent at handling overwhelm. They've got pretty good drink specials every night, and the menu is diverse for a sports bar. The drunken cheddar dip is pretty exciting.   It's an easy walk from anywhere else uptown, so it's a good place to start or finish a night of moving from bar to bar. They serve food until late-night, so get your grease-intake to fight off tomorrow's hangover before cabbing it home."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go to watch numerous sports events. They have a wall full of HDTV's with a massive projection TV in the center of it all.  The food is very good and the kitchen is very accommodating when it comes to ordering food.  The place is clean and the service is great.  There's not much more I can say other than that I love this place. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Disclosure: This review is based on St. Patrick's day bar crawl. So most places weren't on their A game for being slammed, but then again they still get one star even with that consideration.  So what went wrong?  Tables weren't being bussed, so we bussed Menus were sticky from spilled beer Took 15 minutes to order drinks then 15 more to get drinks and order food Food took 2+ hours Appetizers came with the food, not before, making the wait even more agonizing Tater-tot nachos had very few chips and not much cheese, mostly iceberg lettuce Burgers apparently only cooked well done Burgers also come with toast in lieu of a real bun Separate checks are too much work, so we split the table 8 ways  I have to stop, the more I go the higher my blood pressure gets. It was really awful that day, I wish I had just gone to Five Guys and been done with it (I ended up going later).   Get your shit together. Oh and I still tipped the waitress, most of that stuff was the kitchen. Should always tip cause they don't really get paid by the restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I watched my Giants win the Superbowl while slugging Miller Lites there, but Stool Pigeons is a great Sports Bar. The best--for that reason.   It's obviously quieter on Monday-Thurs nights (unless there's a big game on, like MLB playoffs, Monday Football, etc), but there's still normally a decent amount of regulars having evening cocktails and grub. On Friday nights, especially after 8pm, it's pretty packed, and you prob shouldn't expect a table if you're sauntering in casually on a Saturday or Sunday during football season. It's packed with sports fans, some of whom are no doubt pretty hammered.   The food's good, not great. Try the fries and the buffalo chicken wrap. Everything else is so-so.   The drinks, however, are top-notch, and the beer selection deep. And let's be honest--that's why you're here, not because you're looking for an amazing meal. If its sports and booze you love, and a fun/wild/loud/involved atmosphere you desire, then you've found your Mecca.   I like to go on random nights, so if you and yours are looking to do some carousing, stop by on  a Tuesday to watch whatever game is on. After a few beers, you'll be really glad you did."}
{"text":"I would consider Stool Pigeons a sports bar, with a large crowd cheering away on gameday (along with apparently being Ohio State's game viewing bar of choice). There are plenty of tvs throughout, along with a couple in need of replacement on the outside patio. The inside viewing is pretty easy from anywhere in the bar, but finding a seat can prove to be difficult.   The bar area lines one side of the place so there are plenty of spaces to work your way up to the bar to order. The beer selection on tap is extensive & they have a very good selection of higher end beers (Red Oak, Blue Moon, etc.)   I've really only experienced the nightlife here, so I can't really critique the food other than saying the finger food I've snacked on is pretty tasty. The chicken quesadillas were good, but I'm anything probably would have tasted great at the time. Other than that, I haven't experienced much in the food department but the place is always packed with people eating away, so that has to be a good sign for the taste aspect.  Stool Pigeons is a good place to watch a game, with a loud crowd cheering away after every play, to the abundance of good viewing angles & tvs. The atmosphere is pretty live during the nightlife, & make sure you check out their unique fans along the bar, which I'd probably butcher trying to explain."}
{"text":"Good old Stool Pigeons.  This is THE place to be for football Sundays.  There is cheap draft beer and a multitude of TVs to watch. Be aware that on days when the Panthers play at home (8 blocks away) you need to get there early to get a good seat (in this case, front row of tables is best) and know that the bar will be slammed for the later games. During the week, it is pretty quiet for the most part, but that can be okay too.  They do a pretty good job of keeping the Golden Tee game up to date which is nice."}
{"text":"If you are into happy hours and/or lunch specials at bars on random weekdays, this place is THE BOMB. Here's why:  Monday: 2.25 bud lights 4 dollars Smirnoff  4.99 lunch- double cheeseburger  Tuesday: 2 well liquors 2 dollar drafts, $1 TACOS  Wednesday: Trivia night, 2.25 bud lights, 2 wells 4.99 lunch- pepperoni pizza  Thursday: lady nights, $4 sangrias 4.99 lunch- buffalo chicken sandwich  Friday: 22oz beer price of pint 4.99 lunch- 1-topping pizza  Lunch: 11AM-4PM Happy Hour: 4-8PM, appetizers are HALF OFF.  This place is a win if you go on the right day. The food isn't phenomenal, but it's definitely worth the $. Eat on!"}
{"text":"Okay, so after a day full of moving and unpacking boxes we were ready for a beer and some food. We walked a couple of blocks up from our apartment building and found Stool Pigeons. We had every intention of ordering to go, but we sat down at the bar to look at the menu and got way too comfortable.   The place is an upscale sports bar with ample TV's and lots of good beers on tap. I ordered the Mahi pita, which came with mango salsa and pico de gallo on it. I thought it was a high risk maneuver since you never know with fish, but it was excellent. My fiancee ordered the buffalo chicken wrap which he enjoyed, and when he asked for blue cheese the bartender immediately knew we were New Yorkers (I didn't know it was a NY thing?)   We ate at the bar and the service was great. When we first sat down I realized that I left my ID in our apartment and I (understandably) couldn't be served. The bartender was very apologetic, and even got me a water to sip on while my fiancee ran back to the apartment to get my ID (come on, you didn't think I'd let him drink alone, right?) When the bill came the bartender actually bought us a round and discounted our food, he was really cool. He also gave us to free popcorn tickets to see Batman at the Imax! And I didn't even mention Yelp! ;) We will definitely be visiting Stool Pigeon again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch the games.  There is a wall of tvs that shows all the games - legit.  One of the tvs is projection type, and massive.    The food is typical bar fare - although their version of the cobb salad is awesome (Yes, I ordered a salad here - but that's because I mauled a pizza from libretto's the night before - my stomach was not agreeing with me!).  Seriously, nothing wrong with coming here on a Sunday to catch all the games.  Plus, there is a wide variety of fans here, so you won't be stared at."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues, but apparently it's R&B night or Jazz night or something.  They play some old school CDs really loud so it's hard to maintain a decent conversation.  On top of that, it's old school CDs bc the music would skip.  We asked them to turn it down (off) and their response was: It's R&B night.  Uh, so who cares? Literally, there was us and 2 old cougars sitting at the bar - that's about it. Note: We were not sitting with these cougars, but the amount of times they were looking over at our table, I thought it was feeding time - feeling like a piece of meat, sheesh!  Hardly a R&B night if you ask me!  Beers were fine, I liked the multitude of screens.  But it's so dead on Thursday bc of Jazz Night!  Just giving them a heads up, let's trash that idea, yeah? :)    Lol, 2 other corporate dudes walked in, was looking around, saw cougars + music skipping and peaced out.  We totally should have done that.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Pretty chill place.   Generally less crowded and noisy than Flying Saucer.  The bartenders are pretty cool, and do a good job of learning your name.  18 different brews on tap- with $2 mugs on Tuesdays.    The menu is not huge- but it makes sense.  Wings, quesadillas, wraps, burgers and pizza.  The wings are super good.  You might be able to get more varied food elsewhere, but what they have is good, and focused.  The homemade chips are also really good- and served up quick.    Every night they have at least one TV tuned to the Buzztime trivia network.  Trivia is free to play, and the network has an iPhone app- so go for it.    Pool table in the back, and ping pong out front when weather permits."}
{"text":"Ok.. I have looked back on my history of reviews and noticed that the majority of my reviews have been very positive.  Which was rather surprising to me because I have had many people tell me that I am very critical.  WELP... SORRY but this place ROCKS.. $2 bud lights every single day. Cha Ching.  TVs all over the place for NFL Sundays.  Cha cha Ching.  ACC flags (UMD!!) hanging up.  CHA CHA CHING.  Best fried pickles in the city!! JACKPOT.  They also have BUCK HUNTER - Safari (greatest bar game ever)!!  JACKPOT CHA CHING DING A LING..    Ok.. so I really like this place.  The service is great! The outside patio is so comfortable with waiting service too.  Great burgers!  Man.. Im going back.. Please try this place out.  Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"Okay, it's a 2 star trending 3 stars in my mind.   I went there before a Bobcats game with some friends. We were the only people in the entire place. It was kind of nice, but a little bizarre, as we'd expect atleast somebody else there, but to no avail, we were alone.  They have some good stuff going for them: Practically TV's for wallpaper, half price apps (yeah and it's better than that Applebee's garbage), a solid location, and a pretty large bar.  Just wish they had more people going in and out, but hey, faster service for me."}
{"text":"Generic, but what else do you expect from most downtown businesses. It's a sports bar for sure. Every meal comes with it's own built in wide-screen television tuned in to some sport where a a bunch of troglodytes go up against another bunch of neanderthals. Service was nice, the place was fairly empty. The décor was interesting. I liked the low lighting and the fans over the bar.  Pet Peeve... our waitress didn't know shit about the craft beer she was serving us. This is what knocked the 3rd star off.  They have a decent beer selection but you better know your stuff cause asking the waitstaff about their beer selectionwill just get you an, \"umm... err... we have bud, bud light, coors light and miller light on special.\"  Went with a couple of friends. I saw something called Tatchos in their appetizer section. I ordered it as it sounded like the most insanely unhealthy thing I could eat. It certainly was. The appetizer portion could definitely feed half the population of Peru. I can't even imagine what the full entrée size must be! They were ok. Nachos with Tator Tots is what I got.  Overall not a bad experience. Not the type of place I'd plan to go but if my friends, who live right around the corner, drag me there again, it'd be fine."}
{"text":"Ugh! The worst food ever. Who serves a shrimp taco with cheese? There was no mention of cheese on the menu for the meal. The \"Manager\" was unwilling to comp my meal...they took a measly $3 off. The waitress asked what \"side\" i wanted and i chose a salad...we were charged for the side when my meal \"came with a side\". Plus they didn't have the correct vodka for a drink listed on their drink list and they charged us for the more expensive substitute! Hands down, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! Slow service (even though we were the ONLY customers in place). And let us not forget the worst restrooms ever. For a place with NO customers other than ourselves, the handicap stall was disgusting. Toilet clogged, the sinks haven't seen cleanser in quite some time. Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Stool Pigeons is the definition of a mediocre sports bar. It's a bit dirty, but the food is okay. I liked the cheese dip, but the burger was just a burger. Other than that, nothing is particularly memorable."}
