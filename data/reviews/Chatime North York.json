{"text":"I have recently discovered the Chatime on Dundas, and have become a fan. I usually get the grass jelly roasted milk tea. This location was very busy for a cold and wet Monday afternoon, with about 15 people ahead of us. The drink was consistent with the Dundas location. I would probably avoid this location because it is so busy, but without the line, and if I was in the area, I would be there."}
{"text":"It was my first time, so I can't say too much about it. I ordered the Strawberry milk tea with less ice and less sugar. I loved the strawberry bits at the bottom, but even with the request for less sugar, it was still too sweet for my taste. I wish the space was larger as well, it seems to always be busy. I can't wait to try their other milk teas and smoothies though :) Other than that, I liked the strawberry milk tea... but I would probably ask for no sugar next time... is that possible? lol"}
{"text":"The best bbt shop in town!! I'm so glad they decided to open a location in Willowdale,  this is the perfect midtown location. This location gets busy to the point that the line-ups will run outside and the tables are usually full.   The taro milk here is by far the best I've had, it does not taste like fake powder and there are taro pieces. Love the option of having less ice and sugar. Highly recommended spot for bbt if your craving for it."}
{"text":"FUCK this place is soooooo good!!! Hells ya I'm giving them 5 stars. Trust me when I say this, best. bbt. EVARRR!!!!!! Gonna go get some now :D"}
{"text":"I always get the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. Very, very addicting! I did find the taro milk tea a little sandy at the bottom, though. I love that you can customize the sugar and ice to suit your taste. However, like others have mentioned it is hard to get a parking spot and the lineup is quite long. I've waited in line for nearly 30 minutes before and I think that's a little much considering I'm just getting a drink."}
{"text":"I and my girlfriend visited to my relative in North York on Sunday. At the end of the day, I bought two bubble tea, one for me and one for my girlfriend. 2 hours later, when we were in highway to comeback home, both of us had stomach ache. So, we had to take exit highway, and drive round and round to find public washroom. The quality of bubble tea took us to this bad situation, so I never come here again."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea I ever had. I always order the grass jelly milk tea with pearls, no ice and 30% sugar! Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the much hyped bbt. Had to line up to the door - about 15 mins. Ordered the regular black milk tea. Not bad. Still prefer Ten Rens at Metro. Best BBT. :)"}
{"text":"went to grab a drink with a friend after dinner and ordered 2 large pearl milk teas but the cashier  messed it up making it 1 bubble tea instead of 2 and we ended up getting a regular sized cups instead of the large we ordered. I had a rough week so I didn't say anything and we just left, but the tapioca was hard and the tea was pretty crappy so never coming back there again (  )"}
{"text":"Best place for bubble tea.  Not only can you choose your flavour and topping, but you can specify how much ice and sugar you want."}
{"text":"Bbtea is decent, reasonable priced compared to Ten Ren.  However the service is EXTREMELY SLOW.  They gotta take some lessons from Starbucks and Tim Horton's.  Would go back many more times if the service was faster, but I doubt I'll be going here anytime soon until the fad dies down.  It's like watching paint dry."}
{"text":"There are a few times in life when one must use social media...this is of them. This is the first time I've ever written a review for anything - and that everyone, is not a good thing.  The way this Chatime treats their customer is absolutely appalling.  Came in to get 2 bubble teas. One was hot and the other one was cold. They didn't give or offer a tray for them. So when I went to open the door to leave the lid of the hot one popped right off and I ended up burning my hand.  That wasn't even what I was upset about. The fact that they saw what happened, I told them what happened, And all they did was took a mop to it while my hand was burning... I left extremely confounded by their cold indifference.  My friend had to go back in angry explaining to them yet again what happen before they actually did something. Thanks for the horrible tasting free drink Chatime. No, you did not deserve that star. Too bad there are no minuses for this app."}
{"text":"I too have fallen victim to the roasted milk tea with grass jelly!  Although I do try to mix things up so I do need to say the Coconut flavour tea is also pretty amazing.  Service is fast and friendly. It is no wonder why they are so successful."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in Toronto. Period.  The tapioca made in Ten Ren's or viet/hk-style restaurants do not even come close to the ones you get at Chatime.   Chatime has really nailed it with the following reasons:  - option to choose how sweet you want you drink - lots of variety with interesting flavours (beyond Taro, Oolong, Peach, etc..) - did I mention the tapioca is incredible? Fresh tasting and ideal amount of chewiness. - THEIR DRINKS NEVER DISAPPOINT! Consistent quality is key"}
{"text":"Very nice customer service. Even though this place always full of people but waitress/waiter still wear their smile to server every customer. Nice drink with nice service, no wonder this place always full of people. But if they can have more staffs, that might address the line up problem and I'd like to go back more."}
{"text":"I love how much you can customize your orders here!  Most of the drinks are available warm as well as cold--perfect for the chilly, rainy spring we've been having :(  I ordered the roasted milk green tea, as it came highly recommended both on Yelp and by the friend I came with, and it was a great choice for a warm drink.  It's also great that they let you customize your sugar levels--I often find bubble tea too sweet, so it was great to have a no sugar option."}
{"text":"3.5*  One of my favourite locations asides from the downtown location at Dundas W. As with all Chatime, there is usually a lineup and wait times vary from 5 - 15 min depending on the time of day that you are going. I usually come here later around midnight, so the line up isn't as bad.   One thing that makes this location stand out from their other locations is that you do notice that it is less sweet when you request for it and the grass jelly isn't in a large chunk so you don't need to spent the first couple minutes trying to cut it apart with your straw before indulging."}
{"text":"best bubble tea in the city ! caramel milk tea with grass jelly is my favourite. i've enjoyed everything i've tried so far."}
{"text":"Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly is really good at almost locations. I would give a perfect rating, however this location is not exactly the best. The speed of workers are not too fast, and the store is not that big so the line up is bad as it blocks the door."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible!!The guy who has beard and wears glasses is super super rude.He doesn't voice out to my questions and really unkind.Terrible attitude.I can't believe why he is hired as a customer service at cashier.He is the worst staff I've ever met in all industry."}
{"text":"I do not find any significant difference between this location and others (downtown @ Dundas, Scarb @ Midland, Finch-Leslie plaza). Nevertheless, here are the key things to be aware of when considering this branch.  Very convenient location for commuters, just steps away from Finch station. However, street parking only for those coming in cars. Allows use of vicinity rewards card. Limited seating capacity. Expect a line up if visiting from 4pm onwards, especially on the weekends. Washrooms are just ok. ***Accepts cash ONLY for the past few weeks!***"}
{"text":"I'm very happy that another location opened up north! Now I can have more opportunity to enjoy my milk tea  My favorite drink is the roasted milk tea with grass jelly, a very refreshing summer drink!"}
{"text":"Iced oolong milk tea is my favourite here. If you go during the day, it is a nice place to study. It is very busy in the evenings though. The washrooms are not very clean. You can get a points card to collect points towards free drinks."}
{"text":"I like that you can customize things like your sugar and ice levels in your drinks. Their drinks are also consistently good, but my favourite has to be their most popular, the milk tea. I can't remember what it's actually called, as I just order a \"number one\". As for extras, I only order tapioca. Their bubble tea is honestly the best I've ever tried.   The decor is also modern, but the bathrooms are hard to find. And prices are moderate.  However, on weekends, particularly in the evening, there are literally lineups out the door. And it doesn't help that the staff don't make drinks quickly. However, in spite of the aforementioned, their bubble tea is still good enough to make me come back over and over again."}
{"text":"We went to the D/T Chatime first on Dundas St. and were immediate fans.  The Lychee Milk Tea is soooo delicious and with the grass jelly, is such a FUN drink!!  So with that said, we were in North York and decided to go to the Chatime up here.  Maybe it was this flavour only but the way they made the drink was not to the same DT standard.  May try again since everyone has their bad days but I'm just sayin' that DT could be a better experience.  To be continued though ..."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give chatime half a star. I bought honeydew milk tea with aloe Vera jelly and it was disgusting. My drink looks and tastes like regular tea even though the label says honeydew milk tea. The aloe Vera jelly was also disappointing. The customer service was horrible. I was hoping to order my drink in the super cup and instead of explaining that I am unable to order certain drinks, I was given a vague answer. I had to find out why by myself through the internet. It would have been much more convenient to the paying costumer if they could at least explain or answer my questions. The music was so loud making it easy for the employees to dismiss me. This place is not worth my time and money. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Good: You can't go wrong with Chatime. It offers one of the best bubble tea in GTA.  Most of the drinks are consistently good.  Bad:  It may be busy during weekend.  Parking is difficult to find."}
{"text":"Roasted milk tea, so yummy! Especially when it has lots of options to reduce sugar and ice. I'm very pleased. =)"}
{"text":"I've had Chatime in Australia, which seems to be more ubiquitous than here in Toronto, and you'd think for a multi-national company it would have some standards on how their beverages taste but sadly there's just no continuity.  I find the milk teas in Toronto to be more stronger in tea side when compared to the milk teas of the said company in Australia and that to me is a bit off putting. The only good thing is the consistency of the drink: not too thin/watery but not too thick/milky - too thick can be off-putting while too thin can make it feel like you're drinking water than milk.  Please Chatime: standardize the way your milk teas taste cos I have the feeling that you ain't using the same tea as your shops in other countries."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago when I ordered milk tea with tapioca at this Chatime, I ended up with milk tea and half a cup of raw tapioca...as in tapioca so hard I had trouble using the straw and could barely swallow after chewing for ages. I haven't ordered any drinks with tapioca from this location ever since. I also once got extremely ill after drinking their milk tea (it couldn't have been anything other than the drink seeing as I hadn't eaten yet) and it doesn't seem very clean there so I suspect my drink that time may have been contaminated (so gross to think about). I've actually been brave enough to venture back and give them another chance, and at least I haven't experienced food poisoning again. To be fair, their roasted milk tea and winter melon tea is quite delicious. It's enough to keep me going here but I wouldn't recommend the tapioca."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Chatime location.  Friendly staff.  The product is better at this location compared to other ones.  Feels like they're letting their franchise owners do whatever they want.  Always end up coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 drinks: taro milk tea, strawberry milk tea, and grass jelly roasted milk tea. Grass jelly roasted milk tea was good, but unfortunately taro and strawberry milk tea were not good at all. Taro milk tea with pearl drink had very grainy powder texture, and tasted like pudding instead of bubble tea drink? Strawberry milk tea was very sweet even though I ordered 80% less sugar. Disappointed and was expecting a better taste for the price.."}
{"text":"I tried mostly their fruit teas, classic milk tea brown rice milk green tea; they are all good and tasty.  I was able to taste the tea flavour which i really like. There was only one horrible drink that I tried so far and it was quite disgusting :S  Still at this moment, just thinking about this drink makes me want to gag :S  Taiwan plum tea, yuck... couldn't handle the weird taste... I would give this drink minus 10 stars.... Er.... so weird.  Some of my friends said that it tasted like sour plum drink for hot pot...so if you like sour plum drink while having hot pot, you might want to try this drink but not for me."}
{"text":"A clean, modern decor always has a fresh feel to it. Service was quick with a smile, and not a big lineup at this location. I really like how they let you choose the sweetness and ice level, since a lot of other bbt places often make their drinks too sweet or too cold. A bit on the expensive side, but definitely worth going back to from time to time."}
{"text":"This is our go-to bubble tea place!  Our favourites are: Chatime original, roasted milk tea, strawberry milk tea, QQ grapefruit.  Stay away from: Hazelnut chocolate (very artificial tasting).  They also let you choose your sugar and ice level, which seems to be a new fad coming in from Asia. We always get less ice and find that 50% sugar is plenty sweet enough, and in some cases (strawberry milk tea) still too sweet.  Also wasn't a fan of their energy drinks but that is a matter of preference.  If you go often, definitely get one of their loyalty cards (10 drinks any size = 10 stamps, and get the next regular sized drink free)."}
{"text":"I ordered Hot Taro milk tea. The clerk (barista?) asked me if I wanted regular sugar amount. I said \"yes.\" It was too sweet, so I should have said \"less.\" Taste of tea was very good. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. There are many kinds of pastries. They have samples for breads. It was very nice bakery if you like Asian pastries. You can sit and relax and have good time. This Chatime seem to be better than other chatime."}
{"text":"Chatime makes some of the best bubble tea out there! My favorites are pearl milk tea or roasted milk tea but there's so many options that I should discover. The standard amount of ice/sugar is too much for me, so I usually get them both at 30% and I like it that way.   The large size is good but I wish they had something bigger. I usually drink this while working/studying and it's easy to finish it before you want to!   The store itself is a little tight, I've never had a drink and stayed in. When it gets busy, expect to line up, even outside the store. They sometimes also run out of tapioca towards the end of the night.   Regardless, you can't go wrong with Chatime and it manages to stand out despite the competition in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Oh god where do I start. So my friend and I were so looking forward to getting some Chatime after dinner. We order, get our drinks for takeout, and leave. Just as we take our first sips in the car, we find that the tapioca is severely undercooked and impossible to chew. What the heck. I'm lucky to not have experienced indigestion after the many attempts to just suck it up and literally, suck the tapioca up. I ordered the Matcha Latte drink, and it was so powdery. I know that with matcha it's generally difficult to get the consistency right, but damn this drink was like sandpaper to the throat. Really disappointed, and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Overall a great location, with ample seating in case you want to enjoy your beverage on-site. A small, but delicious selection of macarons and cake at the front also! When I go here I usually get the strawberry milk tea with pearls, always a favorite. Pro Tip: Not all of the workers speak strong English, so make sure to enunciate and speak clearly when placing your order!"}
{"text":"Along with a sudden influx of bubble tea shops in the Yonge/Finch area, Chatime has opened their second store in the GTA. Like their first store on Dundas, this location is also packed with people!   What's special and so popular about their milk tea is that it actually tastes like it was made with brewed tea instead of the usual powdery mess elsewhere. I've tried the Roasted grass jelly milk tea (#2 on their Top Ten list) and the Vanilla Fairy Milk Tea. Both tasted strongly of tea and the milk doesn't leave any aftertaste in your mouth. Their stores in Taiwan offers more variety, and an average cup there costs less than $2 CAD. Of course, importing will bump up our price to over $5.00 per cup not including taxes... excuse the bitterness.  In conclusion, Chatime makes fantastic milk tea, so why is service so horrible? I think I've received better service at McDonald's. The cashier was impatient taking my order, and kept telling me \"Your total is...\" when I'm not even finished ordering. Then she ignored my stamp card after I paid - when I reminded her to stamp, she insisted she stamped it. My friends and I are 100% sure that she did not stamp it, but we didn't feel like arguing with her with the line up behind us building up. The other two girls behind the counter were also grumpy and unfriendly.   Personally, service is a huge deciding factor on whether I will return, so.. probably not."}
{"text":"Being regulars at TenRens, my friend and I decided to switch it up and give another place a chance. We both ordered a large slush with tapioca. Not nearly as much flavour compared to TenRens (both in the drink itself and the tapioca), and when you get to around the half way point, it gets even worse and it's pretty much just ice. Would not recommend at all.. Do yourself a favour, spend the extra couple bucks and go to TenRens."}
{"text":"Of course Good location which is at yonge finch, always busy but staff with high efficiency. Yesterday I was here with my friends, I always order tera milk tea with no ice and regular suger. But the tea yesterday was too sweet. Anyway I will definitely return as it is the nearest chatime."}
{"text":"The quality of the ingredients they use is not excellent, at least it wasn't for the matcha bubble tea I ordered. Fresh, high quality matcha should be bright green; theirs is a browny-green (a sign of a lower grade product). The service was disinterested and unengaged. The temperature inside was BOILING. There are lots of bubble tea places in the area. I'm looking forward to trying some others out."}
{"text":"There's something about the almost permanent line-up well outside their front door which, that particular night, had caught our eye and drew us into said line-up in an almost trance-like state. Once we got in, the night outside contrasted with the bright interior, making it feel like we were all at an aquarium to look at the majestic creations that could be made.   the good:  -plenty of options -plenty of stray chat from snippets of conversation about the one time they had some combination of something and it was delicious - as strange as beans in my drink sounds (though I suppose thats what coffee is, bean water *le shrug*)  -you can customize stuff - they have ice and sugar options!! -the folks behind the counter are quick and hard working even though the line was seemingly never ending  the eh:  -long line, but bring a friend or something to do and the 20 minutes will fly like nada   to the bubble tea enthusiasts, worth the try!"}
{"text":"This chatime is in a very convenient location just a short walk from finch station. It gets really busy during off work hours. Even during work hours there is a short line between around 5 minutes wait. Thy always play Mandarin and Taiwanese music, the staff Are not too friendly but they seem efficient.  Whenever I come to chatime I always order a matcha latte or a matcha redbean milk tea with tapioca. Their drinks are usually consistent good quality."}
{"text":"My new favourite bubble tea in Toronto. If I worked/lived any closer, it would be dangerous. Everything I've tried on their menu is great. The flavours taste natural, not overly sweet and I love that you can customize your sugar and ice levels. Prices are cheaper than a lot of other bubble tea places at less than $5 for a large drink without tax.   My go to order is the Milk Tea topped with red bean. The Green tea smoothie's so thick, it's actually quite filling. The roasted rice tea has a great smokey flavour and the chocolate hazelnut tastes like Nutella!  There is always a line though, sometimes out the door. There isn't much seating and it's almost impossible to grab a table. The tables at the front of the store is usually surrounded by the queue of people waiting to order."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible. It is just located at a very convenient location. Honestly, if there was a Ten Rens across the street, I would go there in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Downtown Chatime location gets 5 stars largely because of their quick service and that is exactly what the Finch location lacks!  Because it is a chain joint, the drinks don't taste any different to me compared to the other two locations (yes, including newly opened Markham one). The staff at this Chatime are just so slow at making drinks. I thought I'd cut them some slack for being a new location but after more than a month of opening they're still relatively slow.  NOTE!!!! The WASHROOM is very inconspicuous, causing patrons to often mistake the door entrance. As much as it's slightly funny to see people walk into the staff backroom instead of the washroom, this kind of lack of human design should be fixed asap for the ease of people's Chatime experiences.   So to all those visiting this Chatime in the future and want to go to the washroom, the door is hidden on the wooden wall on your LEFT!"}
{"text":"Like Chatime's all over Ontario, this place does not disappoint. They do get fairly busy during their rushes but it's worth the wait.  I usually get the roasted grass jelly milk tea and the only down side is when I realize they need an extra large.  The restaurant looks very nice and simple and is kept clean."}
{"text":"Chatime is always packed and there is absolutely no room to walk in their store. You need to squish your way through the people and the tables that are positioned right beside the entrance. Don't come here if you don't have patience to wait in line.  I suggest you check out their competitor across the street as they have better tapioca and and a much nicer spacious store set up.   Their bubble tea is nothing special and definitely not the best out in Toronto."}
{"text":"The Good: I use to be an avid tapioca fan but I've been converted to grass jelly with my roasted milk tea. The thing I love about this drink here is that as most people know, you can say how much ice and sugar you want in it. Other places tend to be too sweet and of course load on the ice so you're not really getting much bang for your buck.   The Bad: It might be hard to find a seat on a Fri/Sat and line ups can happen within minutes of getting in so know what you want.   The Overall: Better than the Bay and Dundas location. The interior is nicely designed with its high ceilings and it is very clean with bright lighting. Sleek and modern, making the stay a lot better.   Revisit: For sure. Great place to meet up with friends, but that's only if there isn't an insane lineup which can easily happen on any Fri/Sat... and weeknights after dinner."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the other ones. One time my drink was really powdery and the barista was rude. The other time one of the staff was smoking at the back and the whole place smelled like cigaret smoke"}
{"text":"Came here at night on a weekday. It's overpriced and the quality is sub par. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"???????chatime?????????chatime?official ig????12??????????$3.99???????large hazelnut milk tea???mocha?????????mocha?????????????????????????????mocha??????mocha????????????????????:D ????????????????????????????????????mocha?)??????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the famous Chatime! (I mean I had to. Have you seen my bubble tea list? If you haven't then you should ;)) Like many other Taiwanese tea shops popping up you can customize your ice and sugar levels, which is always a bonus. I tried the matcha bubble tea and also their taro bubble tea. Both were great, with special kudos to the taro one because for once it wasn't the fluorescent purple powdery kinds, and I can taste legit taro in the drink. I also like that they have a large menu, since sometimes you do get tired of the same ol types of bubble tea. Over all, loved it!Plus they have a points card, so will definitely return to earn a free drink!"}
{"text":"Really great teas, but make sure you get it less sweet in my opinion.  The normal sweetness is wayyyyy too sweet.  I sometimes go as far as getting 30% sugar.    Grass Jelly is the best!"}
{"text":"i'm in love with their bubble tea. My favourite is Kumquat bubble tea and i can drink it everyday! people line up at the store every time. Best bubble tea in Toronto IMO"}
{"text":"The products themselves at Chatime are amazing, I work nearby and often come here during the day. They come out with new exciting options all the time such as their World Series or Nutella drinks. The only con to this Chatime is the service, they often mix up your order and their system is inconsistent. I often ask for extra sugar in some drinks and I know certain employees that will honour it while other's will say \"this drink is not available with extra sugar\". The only drink I've ever tried and not liked is their \"Thai Milk Tea\" cause the flavour is so weak compared to the real thing. If you come to this location at night (it's usually open til really late) it's really busy.   Other than that I would choose Chatime over Starbucks any day for my drink fix.  My fav's include (all with tapioca, extra sweet and less ice cause I take long to finish them):   Brown Sugar Roasted Milk Tea Chocolate Hazelnut Roasted Milk Tea (nutella) Ceylon Milk Tea Assam Milk Tea Coconut Day Dream  *If it's your first time here try drink #1 (Classic Milk Tea) on their menu which I think is a good representation of the base of most of their drinks unless you like drinks that are more fruit based"}
{"text":"SOLID. Just like the original Toronto location on Dundas St, this chatime is a solid contender in the bubble tea world here. The bubbles have the perfect texture and flavour (not too sweet, and a hint of tea) and their menu has the same variety as well. Love that this location is now available in North York (a hop skip and jump away from home, no less!)  If you've never been to a chatime, this place has bubble tea like no other. Not only does their drink menu have a huge spread of flavour options, you can also customise your sweetness level (extra, regular, 80%, 50% or 30%) and your ice level (regular, less, none). Perfect for those who want a lighter drink and nothing crazy cold. Which would be me.   Parking here is still a headache - looks like it's street parking for the time being. There's a bit of seating available as well, so if you want to stay and get your moneys worth out of your parking payment you should come early - it always gets busy post-dinner time.   Also appreciate the stamp card (buy ten get one free), which will be perfect for me since I'll be visiting often now!  TIP - The taro is a solid favourite with me and my bro. The matcha green tea latte is a close runner up."}
{"text":"I absolutely love chatime, I would say chatime and ten Ren are quite the tie and at the top of my list of favorite places to go! I love how you can adjust the amount of sugar that goes into the drink :)"}
{"text":"After trying out all the different bubble tea spots in this area, I still always come back to Chatime. I'm a to-go kind of person so I have never had a seat inside and I can't comment on the strength of wifi or the availability of chairs. But I can say that their service is always prompt. They get through the line up of customers as fast as they can and I've never had a mistake with my order. My go to drink is the matcha red bean smoothie with tapioca (MUST TRY). Although in my opinion, bubble tea is pricey (no matter where you go), this particular order is worth it. If you want to upsize, it's about $0.50 more.   When you first walk in to the store, my tip would be to look out for any signs nearby the cashier. Sometimes there will be a sign like \"NO SLUSH\" or \"CASH ONLY\" because a machine is down. So don't waste your time lining up if your order isn't even available."}
{"text":"AMAZING. This is the best bubble tea I've ever tried; so good. Love how easy it is to see the menu too. I'm always craving this bubble tea. I always get the Chatime milk tea with tapioca. Delicious."}
{"text":"Roasted milk tea with grass jelly! I swear it's like a drug. Convenient location for those of us at Yonge and Finch. This location is usually busy except for tonight! It was really cold maybe that's why there's no line ups, no one wants to come out.   I had my usual roasted milk tea with grass jelly. I usually get it with no sugar because the grass jelly is already sweet. And on cold days like this I get it warmed. There's a distinct taste in this tea, it's like a drug, it makes you come back for more (not sure if that's a good thing or not?). I actually like the grass jelly in huge chunks, you keep sucking it up the straw it never ends! The milk tea is really smooth and creamy.   This place seems spacious and there's free wifi. I usually get it to go, I rarely sit down here. The service is okay here, sometimes there might be communication issues. I find the servers speak really fast. Otherwise the drinks are good the place is good, just sucks when you have to wait for the long lines in the summer. I hope they keep opening up more stores!"}
{"text":"Chatime regular here.  Drinks are as good as the other branches.  Only problem I have with this one is one of their new employees.  Everything was fine until he got hired.  Always gets my order wrong and I have to repeat myself atleast 3 times, and when I want to collect my points for a drink,  he still charges me full price.  Another time a coworker and I wanted to get a drink we got charged the same price when hers was a small and I got a large?  Other than that guy being incompetent, good place overall."}
{"text":"I used to love Ten Ren before I discovered Chatime! This place has awesome original milk bubble tea (like the kind you get in China). Only it's slightly pricey in my opinion ($5 for a cup)."}
{"text":"Best milktea around northyork!"}
{"text":"The washrooms are decent, sometimes lacking soap but it's pretty good. There's wifi so that's always a bonus.  The service is pretty fast and the bubble tea is one of the best. All my friends love this place to death and if I wasn't deathly afraid of high sugar things, I'd probably live in here. I've only ordered around 4 times and sometimes when I ask for less sugar I still taste a lot of sugar. When you get your drink customized you might not get it exactly the way you'd like it.  The atmosphere is great for socializing or just doing work if you're able to work with the small conversations going on around you."}
{"text":"There is no better bubble tea in Toronto so far! I've tried every kind in Taiwan when I was there for a month and this is the closest thing to the ones in Taiwan!  #2 just like everyone said. Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly- perfect marriage between flavors. - I always order 30% sugar - no ice (you get more tea duh)  If you must ask for another good bubble tea place it has to be Ten Ren and ONLY the Highway 7 location in Markham."}
{"text":"This is easily the best bubble tea place in the area. It's always busy with line ups even late at night. Quality is very good. You can taste \"real\" flavor of whatever you're getting. The workers are efficient. You have a lot of choices for customizing like no/less sugar etc. so it can fit everyone's tastes.   It's going to be more expensive than places like 168 and Chatime doesn't have a lot of specials. But this is one of those cases where you get what you paid for. I typically don't like to drop $6 for a drink but for Chatime they've made me make an exception."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in the GTA! The very first Chatime opened in the downtown core near Bay and Dundas over 2 years ago and they have been booming since! The North York location is by far the best offering consistency and quality bubble tea. You'll find lineups out the door but it moves pretty quickly. I like the fact that they have a top 10 menu which allows newcomers to try any of these drinks that wont disappoint. If the weather is warmer I usually get the honey oolong milk tea or hazelnut milk tea or on a colder day, their hot drinks such as the sweet potato almond milk tea is my fave! Truly authentic bubble tea that tastes great every time."}
{"text":"If you live in North York or frequently visit this area then its safe to assume that you are familiar with the infamous chatime lineup. Today I decided to try it out and see what the fuss is all about.  It was cold so I ordered hot tea and milk. It was warm and fresh. Service was quick and friendly. Prices are reasonable but keep in mind this is K-town and you can easily get bubble tea for $3.99 anywhere else.  Decor is brought to you by IKEA. If you look up you will see wooden rectangles hanging from the ceiling (I thought that was fascinating). Washroom door blends in nicely with the wall. Free WiFi. K-pop was playing in the background.  A OK overall. I still fail to see why the lineup and what the fuss is all about."}
{"text":"This place is always busy but I will keep going back anyways. Love the iced matcha tea. My favorite part is that you can regulate the ice and the sugar. This is something that should be available everywhere. Points cards are the best!"}
{"text":"My first impression was that this place was not exactly what I expected. I've heard great things and that's why we chose to go here, but I wasn't initially impressed. It was really small with very little comfortable seating area, unlike the other tea shops in the area. I like that they had simplified menus (with the top 10 drinks) because there can sometimes be sooo many options. The service counter was kind of abrupt too, especially considering we were being helped by the assistant manager, so I was kind of expecting a bit more in the customer service area. But I understand that it was Friday and was maybe busier than usual, although I've never been there before so I don't know. We ordered our drinks and they came quite quickly. And they tasted good but nothing special. Just ok. I feel like sometimes these places charge you $5 for chocolate milk and they inflate it like crazy because they throw some tapioca in there.  That being said, the place WASN'T BAD. The drinks were yummy and the interior decor was cool and unique. They also have wifi and many TVs (But all they show is advertisements, which could be show on maybe one or two of their 5 TVs. Can better utilize this to show cable channels)   Overall, I probably won't come back or recommend to a friend, simply because there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"This location is very busy but it's a great place for bbt. My Fav: grass jelly roasted milk tea."}
{"text":"Come here all the time.  One of the better bubble tea place in this area.  I actually never go in, just do take outs. I only give 4 stars because of its long queue lol"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that FRANK deserves a promotion. I am a bubble tea addict and unfortunately, for most places the serving is lacking. Here, in addition to the great drinks, frank is the friendliest server. Asking if you need a bag for take out, placing the drinks into the bags vs. Others who throw the bags at you, and thanking every customer for coming in. WOW."}
{"text":"The manager Kai, messed up my order (don't know how many messed up orders he did beforehand, causing a long line) he can not tell the difference between the different jellies. It caused me to wait extra long, for my correct drink again, and by this time my metered parking outside had expired and I'm left with a ticket for an extra $40 bucks. Totally not worth my time. This was one of the most expensive bbt I have had."}
{"text":"Dear all my fellow yelpers,  To those of you who feel you'll be a victim of chatime's delicious bubble tea if you lived close by. I shall present to you exhibit Angelica, She lives walking distance and can't seem to control herself when it comes to bubble tea,specifically Chatime.  Even though she complains about the line, she is still addicted and needs bubble tea intervention. To those who care, please help her.               Bubble tea has driven her insane!"}
{"text":"I like that this place is close to work Always ordering Roasted milk tea with grass jelly!  I like to customize my drink --- even less sugar is still sweet. I always order half ice The lineup is usually long. After a wave of customers, a new wave would come in .  Good for them for having good business.   Also I usually never enjoy grass jelly -- but its so soft and easy to slurp! I love that roasted milk tea flavor.  i've tried regular milk tea before, but it just taste different with the roasty addition.   I didn't enjoy taro (probably because it is a mixture of real taro and powder) but it tastes so chalky that I sometimes forget maybe I'm slurping the taro chunks --- but really feel like it may be unmelted powder!"}
{"text":"Kudos to Chatime for building such a strong brand worldwide with so many competitors out there, but I just can't see the difference between all the different bubble tea shops. Chatime is known for better quality bubble tea (but it's all still powder says my inside source) for a higher price. The average for a regular size is $4.20 and a large is $4.70. All the add-ons are an additional $.50. I find drinks across all chains to be pretty consistent, and there's free wifi at every store.  Given that this location is right by Yonge and Finch which is a predominantly Korean night life area, you can find lines that go out the store on weekend nights. Even if there aren't any lines, there's very limited seating! Parking is a mess. There's street parking if you're lucky to find any spots in front of the store, or you can take your chances and park on the side street in front of the high school one block ahead (you may or may not get ticketed), or behind Shoppers Drug Mart one block before Chatime (60 minutes for Shoppers customers).  The good thing about Chatime is that their drinks aren't too sweet. I usually get 50% sweet for bubble tea drinks, but this one is quite good with 80% sweet. I get cravings for bubble tea quite often, but I can go months without having a craving for Chatime in particular."}
{"text":"Chatime lover from the downtown location. Happy they opened up another one, close to my work! Servers can be pretty rude, and if you are there to have a quiet conversation this probably won't be a good place due to the loud blenders, loud talkers & music. (same goes for the downtown location it's soooo loud) The only thing that makes up for it is the good bubble tea."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, this chatime had their shit together.. but now slowly.. they are getting worse and worse.   This chatime has never once messed up my drink, so I give the workers props on that one. They really know what they're making. However, they are getting SO slow.. they put the toppings into the cups and just leave them all lined up before putting the milk tea into them. Instead of working on them asap, they wait until there's 4-7 cups waiting until they decide to work on them all together. Also, my server did not give me a receipt so I did not know which # I was, it usually wouldn't be a problem but when the store is full as fuck, it gets hard to get your drink.  AND.. the lines are NOT ok! LOL. They weave all around the store and sometimes out onto the street.. when that happens, just don't wait. It's not worth it, I promise.   Chatime stores are always too crowded and it can get uncomfortable being too close to someone while waiting to order bubbletea."}
{"text":"I've been to almost all the Chatimes in Toronto other than the one in downtown. Overall this one of the worse ones Ive been to. I went there with my friends 3 times and their drinks were inconsistent. I order the same drink every single time but the sugar level was very different each time. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"This Chatime is located in the heart of Koreantown uptown and is always a trendy and popular for people to get their bubble tea. There are often lineups here seating is limited but that's very standard across all locations. When it does get busy, it can take anywhere from 10-15 minutes to get your bubble tea order. I ordered the Chatime Roasted Milk with Rainbow Jelly and ordered a few other bubble teas for my friends. It did take a bit longer than usual because it was quite busy. 10 minutes later, I finally got my order. The staff seemed a bit overworked when it got busy but I still got my bubble tea and it's understandable when it gets busy. Can't say anything bad about their bubble tea!"}
{"text":"The QQ milk tea was awesome! Staff were really friendly :) This place is very busy though since it also shares the same space as Bake Code."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this location out I always pass by it and the line up is ridiculously long. Finally got here on a Monday night around 9pm and its quiet tried the roasted brown rice green milk tea hot with tapioca and it is delicious. Very good drink I see the quality of the drink tastes really good and authentic. Would come back again but line ups I tend to avoid... Its too crazy here daytimes."}
{"text":"My favourite bubbletea place! Everyone usually gets the roasted milk tea with grass jelly, which I also love but my favourite is the brown rice green tea and I always add pudding and grass jelly. Not really a place to hang out and have some bubbletea like 168, go for tea or destiny so I always just take out."}
{"text":"Chatime is the Starbucks of tea.  Probably one of the best Bubble Tea chains in the category.  I especially appreciate editing the amount of sugar in my drink.  I have had some bubble teas that made my teeth ache.  Also, this chain is pretty consistent with its product.  My go-to is Mango Green Tea with 1/2 sugar, or a Coconut milk Green Tea.  I have tried a few other flavours and suffered a drought when they ran out of Mango syrup for a couple of months, but I keep going back to the crisp, refreshing taste of the Mango Green Tea.  There are times I will buy 3 or 4 servings and keep them in the fridge so I can have one each day.  Am I addicted?"}
{"text":"Went here from time to time.  Washroom aren't clean as it supposed to. And some of the staff are touching there heads but not washing there hands after.   Drinks are okay for the most part"}
{"text":"Bubble tea is the best after a big meal. I usually go get bubble tea with my friend after we finish dinner or whenever we're craving. It has become a dessert choice for us. I usually get the honey green milk tea with grass jelly.  Funny enough, it is the tea of the month at Chatime, which means that for a large it's 3.80 not including toppings or tax. This location is always popping in the evening whether it's a weekday or weekend.   Pros: - Drink Quality is always consistent. Some locations can be a hit and miss in the situation where they'll make a drink and it'll be great the first time but the next time it'll be a disappointment.  - Location is great because there's a lot of food options in the area.   Cons: - Limited Parking. There is only street parking so when it's popping, it hard to find parking. You usually have to park at the lot behind shoppers however it is enforced so you would have to pay.  - Limited seating - Long line ups"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location and bubble tea place. For something heavy/dessert-y I recommend: brown sugar roasted milk tea with half sugar and less ice. For something light: mango qq without the tapioca or honey lemon green tea with aloe vera. Always reduce sugar to 30% if possible (for honey and brown sugar, can only reduce by half).  The lines are long during weekends but they move fast. It's very happy location with tons of people that just hang out after dinner. Though during weekends and evenings do not expect to get a seat, this place is packed. I've always taken mine to go so did not have these issues."}
{"text":"Being a man of relatively relative to relativity proportions, I am pleased to say that the refreshment volumes from this fine establishment was welly sufficient for the appetite for a man of my magnitude.   With a plethora of drinks and a myriad of topping options to choose from, you can't go wrong with any! The only botheration I do have qualms in regarding is the lack of sizing options; being that there are only two size options available, as I always find myself looking for seconds, but that's just my druthers.   Amenities include Wifi and pokestops, as the fine oriental beverage retailer also incorporates a well stocked bakery front.   Definitely a most wonderful experience, 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"This location is usually busy with line ups but not as bad as the Dundas location, with more space. My favourite is their pearl milk tea, the only downside is when they don't fill up the cup to the rim and I end up chewing on tapioca without my milk tea. Overall, delicious milk tea and makes the list!"}
{"text":"The cashier named, \"ZOE or JOY\" were super rude.. I ordered no sugar taro milk tea but she did not note it. So i told her \"I said No sugar please\" and she was so mad and looked at me very angrily for 3 seconds. I was so embarrassed and I told her that you do not have to stare at me like that. But she just ignored and dumped that. I cannot imagine this kind of attitude even from starbucks. They totally do NOT have customer serving mind but they just like MONEY like many other Chinese restaurants do. Very very disappointed. Even though the quality of beverages are good, those staffs should LEARN HOW TO SERVE customers."}
{"text":"The Markham location is opening this month (October 2013). Sorry about the confusion. They tweeted me saying \"We will let you know as soon as we are ready!\""}
{"text":"Ordered a drink through UberEATS. Delivery comes without a straw. When we asked the uber driver he said he just delivers,  its Chatime who preps the delivery. We called Chatime, their reply was: \"we can't do anything about it.\" No apology, no nothing. The only thing they could offer was a discount when we go to their location. If we were that close, why would we bother to use UberEATS??? So we decided to order again through UberEATS and wrote a note to include extra straw. Guess what, only one straw included. After 3 hours, we still have 1 drink thats lukewarm without straw. When we called chatime again, their reply was,  \"its our policy to only give one straw per drink\". But it was their fault there  was no straw included in the first order. If i paid for the straw it would have been a different story. Oh well, thank goodness there are lots of choices when it comes to bubble teas and Good customer service wins customers i guess business should be taken elsewhere."}
{"text":"They opened a ChaTime in North York!? Dangerous. The great thing about his location is that it's so close to me, off the subway and the best part? Not too many people inside. Usually when I go to the one downtown, there's always a bunch of people sitting inside. My friend and I quickly got a seat inside.   The one thing that was entertaining was that people were searching for the washroom. It's located next to the garbage and sort of hidden inside the wall. You'll see.  My recommended drink? Logan and red date."}
{"text":"Usually I find the quality of the drinks at Chatime fairly consistent throughout the chain, but my visit today heavily disappoints.  At first, I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in because they now sell some items from Bake Code, so I won't have to make the trip down to Sheppard/Yonge if I'm craving the cheese tart ($5.5) or mille crepe ($7.2). But then it started going downhill from there...  The cashier was rather rude and impatient at me. I get it that he might be overwhelmed by the weekend crowd, but I've been to the Chatime downtown and even there the customer service was a lot better compared to this guy.  And then there's the drink. I was rushed by the cashier so I just ordered the Tea of the Month which happened to the Chocolate Hazelnut Milk Tea. It sounded promising until I took a sip of it... Disgusting! The drink literally tasted like some version of watered down, cold hot chocolate mix. No tea flavour what so ever. I'm slowly sipping my drink as I'm typing this review and I'm thinking of just tossing it because it's that bad.  Would have just gone with 1 star, but I do like that I can now buy Bake Code desserts here."}
{"text":"Late night Bubble Tea go to spot! Tons of positive things to say!    Pros:  - Drinks: Ordering Drinks here is consistent in the sense of I always know what I'm getting in comparison with other Chatime locations which sometimes mess up my order. If I order half sugar, it tastes like it! I love their selection of drinks, so many options!  - Line Ups: Unfortunately if you go during prime time the line up usually extends all the way to the back from the cashier to the washroom. Luckily the servers work quick and your not waiting to long to get your bubble tea fix!   Cons:  - Parking: There is no available parking unless you park on the street and want to pay.    Drinks/Dessert I love:  - Honey Green Milk Tea with Grass Jelly (Warm or Cold)  - Blue Mountain Green Tea with Tapioca  - Japanese Sakura Sencha with Tapioca  - Jasmine Green Tea Mousse (No toppings)  - Honey Green Tea with Tapioca  - Macaroon Flavour: Pistachio, Roasted Milk Tea"}
{"text":"wow this place was packed service was still pretty fast, it was like an assembly line got the milk tea with pudding for $4.50 so refreshing and so addicting I'm glad I don't live close to one of these places otherwise I will be more fat than I am now and more broke than I am now"}
{"text":"What Chatime is to bubble tea, is what Starbucks is to coffee. Chatime's a popular chain of tea shops with consistent quality and service. They also have a rewards card program and a huge fan base. And just like Starbucks, their drinks are pricey.   Regardless, it's a nice spot to catch up with friends. There's a massive menu, so don't worry, you have choices. My go-to drink is the grass jelly roasted milk tea with 20% sugar. The food selection is very limited there (a few doughnuts, I think), so I would recommend grabbing a bite elsewhere. There's a wifi and a bunch of TVs, but the TVs only show ads so it's kind of boring after a few repetitions. Chatime has a bunch of seating available, but beware of the long lines to the cashier.  Chatime's good, but not the best."}
{"text":"The bubble tea is always consistent here, however I stopped sitting inside and just got take out after they stopped keeping the restaurant clean. It looks and smells like the one on Dundas west (bay/Dundas) which is not a good thing.   However this place is always busy, so that's a good sign.  My favourite is currently the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. And like most of the new chains in TO, I love that you have options for ice and sugar content.   Overall, it's a prime spot for consistent bubble tea in the north York area. But note that their competition is moving in left and right (coco tea on Finch west of Yonge, ShareTea in the north way town nook, Gong Cha across the street, and then the smaller ones like Mabu Station, Sweet o'clock etc)."}
{"text":"4 Stars - Drink Quality  2 stars - service   Don't bother trying to use your vicinity promotions here when they send you a text. The asian manager guy gives you the most dirtiest look and tries to give all these reasons for it not working. He looked like he hates his job alot and I was very close to just calling it off and walking a couple steps down the block to order my usual from coco.   I will reconsider coming back but the drinks are good nonetheless. I do hope chatime expands on their drink selections and honor their promotions with ease next time."}
{"text":"Uh oh..  Here they go. It was a five until they recently started giving me the wrong orders. Twice.   And they have been running out of things such as mango drinks, and mango and coconut jellies.   Drinks are still above average and prices still beat out the competition so still a solid four star."}
{"text":"I like this new trendy bubble tea joint!  I've been to three locations in the GTA, and I find that this is my favourite one. It's been quite consistent when it comes to the texture and amount of jelly they provide. I usually order a lychee green tea with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice, medium. They also have a loyalty card that they scan when you make a purchase. Very good incentive to keep customers returning! Beware, on weekend evenings, it gets very busy, so be prepared to line up!"}
{"text":"#1 and #2 on the menu are what I usually order; not too particular about bbt, but it's always half sugar and no ice for me :P  This place is way too small just like every other Chatime chain there is, be prepared for a 30min line!  Their debit machines also seem to not be working well so ATM visit before coming plz.   Def just grab & go, grass jelly is the bomb :3"}
{"text":"The milk tea is okay but the straw and the packaging drove me nuts. I paid 5 dollars can't u repackage my milk tea with something that won't let me spill the tea everywhere"}
{"text":"Love Chatime!! I usually drop in early Sundays and the man behind the counter in always very friendly   The bubble tea always tastes delicious and the store always looks bright and clean. Two thumbs up every time!!"}
{"text":"there are many milk tea places nearby, but Chatime is the best!  I got a membership card. Every month members are entitled to get the monthly special. Large size for 3.99. Pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"I actually came to Chatime like 4 or 5 times already. (Every time you blew like over $5 for a bubble tea).  Grass jelly with roasted tea is my favorite. I like the fact that I can choose my sugar level (which is usually no sugar), and amount of ice. (which is less ice).  The bubbles they have is cooked perfect, so thumbs up for that. The selection of the type of tea are slightly more than other bubble tea shop. I am talking about the different type of tea. not the one with different added flavors.   I would avoid just getting plain tea because they add water to dilute the tea and it just doesn't taste right. However, if you add bubble or grass jelly to it, they seem to work better together.  Huge line up every time I come here. And then I realize, it was the slow service they have at the desk. This place only serves tea, and tea only. And most of the people are buying it as take out. The people who works there seems to be all under training or something so it is taking them a long time to punch in the orders.  I still come here sometimes because they still serve better tea than 168 or any other tea shop near by. The only other tea shop I would visit is Tenren. Both are just as good."}
{"text":"Love it here. I usually get the grass jelly roasted milk tea with less ice and 30% sugar and it is just right. The staff is always efficient and polite and I've never had a problem with my order. I also recommend the wintermelon if they have it. Haven't tried much else since my regular is just toooooo good to pass up! Also, make sure you get a Vicinity card to collect points"}
{"text":"Massive line ups, tables always filled... this location opened up this month in our area. we were wondering what is up w/ the hype? it's just bbt.   I had the chocolate hazelnut milk tea w/ no tapioca, etc as the price was already a little high for my taste. It had a nice flavour (not too sweet). I couldn't taste the powder ....def not a dodgy bbt shop :). I would definitely like to try a few more drinks though & take advantage of the 'buy ten get one drink free' stamp card.  If this location wasn't so close to us i don't think we'd be coming here."}
{"text":"This place can reach full house quick and you tend to get trapped in between herds of students but the rain made way to a line-free 2 minute wait to bubbletea #1 50%sweet and less ice. Chatime made me like bubble tea again. One standard color for their straws which makes life easier and in hygienic ready to grab plastic.  The choice on sweetness level demonstrated giving a damn about their customer's daily dose of sugar and personal taste, or being set apart from the many bubbletea joints in toronto takes tea time with ice to the next level.  Good quality tea base and their taro drink  really is the non chemical induced stuff. I got so used to the fake version that it ended up overwhelming me. Sadly, not the best tasting one coming from someone who loves ube ice cream/cake and anything taro.  Other faves #2 and the matcha latte. I will try all flavors because I've got tea swag like that. Tips to follow..."}
{"text":"As consistent as any other chatime, and also like any location, there's always quite a lot of people here. It's one of the better-decorated locations :)"}
{"text":"Good ol Classic bbTea. Got the red bean milk tea - HOT, slight sugar, half tapioca, and small. Had a craving for a hot beverage but obviously a bbtea would suit the craving. This location is close to my house where it's steps outside my door. The only preference is the service could be a bit better. The staff always look so unhappy working there and they aren't very talkative or friendly. Being the service industry in the past, the most important to make your customers feel welcomed. This location appears to be your typical Asian service, order, eat/drink and out.   Overall, great for the drinks."}
{"text":"consistent quality and flavor. I love their grass jelly"}
{"text":"Hands down, best bubble tea franchise. I wish it had more and nicer seats."}
{"text":"Love the roast milk tea, but I prefer with only \"slight sugar\"... A little pricy for a cup of milk tea, but the taste is worth it. Nice environment, but be prepared for the huge line-up if you're coming in after 9. This place gets really crowded at night."}
{"text":"Closest chatime for me. I don't think I would ever say it since there are so many bbt / boba tea places around the gta BUT this place has a pretty good and different original milk tea with grass jelly drink."}
{"text":"It looked crowded, but service was quick. I wasn't able to get a seat, but it was a nice area for a walk and the weather was good."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the matcha latte made it on their top drinks screen. I came back wanting them to remake it, and the cashier took another straw, poked a hole, and took a sip from the drink I already drank ... gross.    any who, I don't recommend that item on the menu. either that location doesn't know how to make it right, or it just tastes nasty. it looks quite appetizing though."}
{"text":"This location introduced us to Chatime and we love it! This place is always busy and service is pretty efficient. The best is #2, the roasted tea with grass jelly. Wish they had more fresh fruity flavours.  Parking here sometimes is a pain and watch out for the fire hydrant right in front of the store!"}
{"text":"The service does not exist here.  Rude and unfriendly.  Drinks are hit or miss, depends on who makes it. They never get the tapiocas right. It's always mushy. So one day, I got pudding instead. They cheaped out so bad that I only got 2 small chunks in the drink.  Seriously?  They never get my order right, and I'm done with this location.  I would rather walk a little bit more and go over to Coco Fresh.  So long Chatime North York."}
{"text":"Really unhappy with their service today. Ordered 2 drinks but the cashier didn't ask me neither the cold/hot drink nor sugar preference. I didn't notice at the beginning because it was cold outside I thought they should be hot. They weren't. After I told the staff she explained the cold is the default option. Not even an apology. How come a customer would know whether it's a default when there's 7 Celsius outside? Chatime drinks are generally good but I won't go to this location again."}
{"text":"I accidently stumbled across this location when there was a subway outage yesterday and had to walk from Sheppard station to Finch.  I ordered a large chatime milk tea with bubbles came out to around $5.31. You can customize the drink by specifying how much sugar you want or how much ice. I ordered 1/2 sugar with less ice. The taste came out pretty close to the ones in Taiwan.  Price is a little steep for your everyday drink but I guess its alright once in a while."}
{"text":"Worst service the waiter not colse the cups well. Two of the fruit tea was spilled, my bag and computer is destroyed. I give them a call, but they never say sorry and no compensate for me. I will never go to Chatime again."}
{"text":"Me likey. Got the Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea (#2 on their Top 10 board) and first taste was strong tea taste, which is a huge nom factor for me! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here once and the milk tea was quite good. I got the large pudding milk tea and the taste from the drink to the pudding is like soya-based. It was very unique. I think this location has the best milk tea compared to other franchise location."}
{"text":"Chatime has got to be my favourite place for bubble tea. You can definitely taste tea in their milk teas and that's probably the reason why I keep coming back to this place.  All the other bubble tea joints I've had cannot compare to Chatime. This location is super busy. Most of the time you'll see a line up outside of this place.  Fortunately, their service is quick and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love chatime! They also have millecrepe cake and other desserts. I get taro slush with coconut jelly. If you love taro like I do, be warned that the taro milk tea has a grainy texture that I didn't like hence why I get the slush. The flavours are more rich than other bubble tea places. Sometimes there's a long line, other times you can order right away. Just depends on timing and luck"}
{"text":"Chatime is my favorite bubble tea chain when it comes to tea-based drinks. And yet, this location is beyond disappointing. Drinks are great but the customer service is just, not even present lol. The cashier, \"Miss Sasha\" was completely dismissive and rude when people were ordering. It was not even busy at the time and yet, she displayed impatience and annoyance at the customers. I mean, it's quite obvious if one's in a customer-service based job, you need to provide good customer service. But, if you're up for the quick grab and go, no fuss or frills, like in most Asian shops, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"There service is a hit or miss. The cashier may or may not be friendly. But they make their drinks within 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Near the counter, you will find the following sign:  \"If you like our service, rate 5 stars on yelp\"  If you've never been to chatime before and looking up reviews to see if it lives up to the hype.. then shame on you ."}
{"text":"Chatime seems to be popping up everywhere now.   This location is great if you are in the Yonge/Finch area as it is just south of the Finch Subway Station.  Parking might be an issue, but here are paid meter parking right outside the store (free parking after 10 pm)   I guess I was lucky to be here on a weekday afternoon with practically no one around.. no line and I got served immediately.  Just like most of the Chatime I am been to, the staff here never looks like they are happy to work here...   I do my Roasted Milk Tea with Pearls ($4.70+$0.50).   PS They have donuts for sale too... I don't know if I really want a donut with my bbt though.."}
{"text":"Not even worth half a star. This store has a skinny male staff with glasses that needs serious anger management. Beyond just rude. Psychotic.  I left a review on the same staff few months ago. He was there today. Not surprisingly enough, he was being extremely offensive and of course that ruined my time being.   When drinks were ready for pickup, he screamed out loud with such tone as \"get your drink and get the fuck out of my store\".  He lined up 4 different drinks and wouldn't even tell me which one was mine. He created scary environment and i could feel the negative vive running very strong.   Seriously, he seemed to be ready to kill someone. Made the environment extremely uncomfortable.   Chatime needs to know what their staff is doing to their customer isn't simply under-satisfying service. It's a violation. Business that doesn't appreciate the customer will end soon."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced drinks with very authentic taste. I would definitely recommend this place!   Warning: There are huge lineups for drinks, especially during dinnertime. Be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes for them to take your order."}
{"text":"Good quality, reasonable price and good location.  I had the lemon smoothie and I very impressed as it didn't taste premade.  I stayed in store to enjoy my drink and the decor is hip and fresh.  Will be making weekly visits."}
{"text":"K I am really pissed with the cashier staff at this time. The only reason I came here was that I had a buy one get one offer from vicinity.   I told them my phone number and showed them the message on my phone. But they said I needed to provide my card. I'm like wtf. Vicinity allows you to use your phone number in place of your card like almost every other place.   So pissed off I just wrote this review right as I got into my car. I would be too pissed a mood to drive home if I didn't.  FYI to the owner if they actually care. it's 8:26pm."}
{"text":"Delicious bubble tea, quick service, and awesome customizable options. I wish Chatime came to the States. If you haven't already, try the mango green tea -- it's my favorite. Lychee green is pretty good, too. :)"}
