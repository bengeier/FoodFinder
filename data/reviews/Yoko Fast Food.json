{"text":"Yoko is traditional and modern with speeds almost as fast as the \"other guys\" cough cough, with that being said Yoko's offers traditional Japanese/Chinese style food made to order (meaning freshly cooked when you order) at great prices with (HEFTY) portions. If you're looking for a quick bite or meal for lack of better words, come in to Yoko's where the staff is always willing to help and able to speak great English you won't be disappointed. Try the Teriyaki Chicken it's number one on the menu for a reason! 5/5 all day long."}
{"text":"Eat here at least twice a week! Best teriyaki sauce around. You can add extra chicken in dollar increments. Great flavors, healthy, tons of protein. Great for maxing on those macros."}
{"text":"1st time here and it was a great experience, staff was super friendly and quick!Good was amazing!! Can't believe this place has been here so long and I haven't tried it before. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a great place for when you're feeling asian food. Probably slightly more authentic than other places but it's still fast food. I really enjoy most the things on the menu, my top 5 favorites being: 
Katsu Pork
Lemon Chicken
Sukiyaki
Beef Yakisoba
Pepper Beef

Staff is nice, and I enjoy going here. It's a really solid place when you want some good food for cheap. Definitely one of the places I return to over and over again! Been eating here for the last nine years lol."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Great service and very helpful. Will be going back again! The drawback paying 50Â¢ for refills."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Very traditional Japanese \"fast food\". The beef teriyaki was made just perfectly. However, there were a couple cons to this place. There is no bathroom in the restaurant. On the other hand it is located on Gilbert and baseline. There are lots of other places to use the bathroom in that area. I am a fan of the food. Service was wonderful and the staff was very nice. overall 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is NOT your typical fast food. Crab Angels are to die for. Super clean super fast and ALWAYS yummy! It's been here forever - that should tell you something!"}
{"text":"This place is delish! The orange chicken is very good and the fried rice is great! I get the fried rice with no meat, no egg, and next time I'll ask for no bean sprouts either as they're a bit overwhelming. The orange chicken was very flavorful and the perfect texture of crispy. Food is served hot and made to order which is nice. They do charge a .50c fee for using a debit card and char for refills. Also their prices are about $2-3 dollars more than listed online so fried rice and orange chicken is about $16 in total. Overall good food and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Yoko's for years and I have never been disappointed! The food and service has never been anything short of amazing. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone! My personal favorites are the teriyaki chicken and orange chicken."}
{"text":"I love eating here!! The food is delicious and always fresh and stays hot. My favorite is the Katsu Bowl! It's so good! The staff is always kind and welcoming, large rushes don't seem to phase these workers at all. You'll still get your food quick, and be able to sit in either the main eating area - the side room, or outside by the flowers. A super authentic feel to all of the dishes, and I bring coworkers and friends here regularly. It pays to stay consistent for over 20 years!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best places i have ever been. I have been eating here for sometime now and no place beats it. The food is always scrumptious and its well priced. Everyone i take there falls in love with the 12 and why not its fantastic! If you haven't tried this place you need too!!"}
{"text":"So, I Had The Chicken Yakisoba (Chow Mein) I was not impressed at all. Sadly as soon as I took my first bite I knew I wasted my money. Didn't have enough chicken and  the noodles were over cooked the flavor could have been better. Now I'm now saying the place was horrible that's why I gave it two stars not just one. The atmosphere wasn't great either that should have turned me away in the first place but I had a friend that was telling me how good this place was so I gave it a shot. I will not go back"}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to Yoko's in 2005 and let me just say this is my go to place for the best Japanese food! I always order the beef yakisoba and my husband orders the orange chicken but within the past year we have been trying new items off the menu and to be honest I don't know what our favorites are any more they're all too good to pass up. This place is who we recommend to anyone who has never been before and I'm glad they're just a phone call away and easy to pick up and take home."}
{"text":"Best Yakisoba and Orange Chicken EVER!!!!
And service is amazing as well. 
Have been visiting the place for over 10 years, wouldn't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for Yoko yet!!! This is hands-down our favorite locally-owned place for Asian food - and we have tried several since moving here about 3 yrs. ago.  My husband is pretty much a one-trick pony (always Sweet and Sour Chicken), but I like variety and was totally spoiled by a great little local place in our small town in Cali. Yoko takes its place! Clean, no frills restaurant, with adequate seating; fast (have never had to wait on an order. - usually ready in less than 15 min!), friendly, efficient, and delicious. I have tried many of their menu items  (except for really spicy ones, but they are awesome about adjusting the heat if you just ask) and have never had a complaint. Love their beef and shrimp yakisoba, as well as teriyaki items. Crab Angels always in our order, and the Gyoza is nicely done, too. Their sushi selection is basic, but tasty, prepared to order and always packaged separately; I like the care and concern given each time. You will never go hungry with an order of anything from Yoko!!! My only caution would be that white rice comes with everything, unless you specify none. That said, they always give me as much noodles as they would rice, so I am happy! Price wise, no complaints. As they say, \"You get what you pay for!\" Convenience and flavor win everytime."}
{"text":"Bomb. Awesome food with a great service! Definitely a place to hit up for some fresh food. Orange chicken- great. yakisoba- great. everything on the menu - great."}
{"text":"Tried Yoko last night for the first time,  and it definitely won't be the last! Absolutely delicious and already can't wait to go back. We had the shrimp yakisoba and orange chicken,  and we polished them off!"}
{"text":"Always good and always consistent.  Great friendly service.  Excellent for a quick really good lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Yokos for years and after taking several family and friends there and they've become fanatics as well. Great Mom and Pop place that has been there for a long time. A staple of Mesa for sure! Food portions are good and prices are cheap when you compare them to other fast Asian diners. Teriyaki Chicken never disappoints. Orange and house chicken is always good. Clean environment, good service, consistent food quality. If this place ever closes, I don't know what I would do with myself."}
{"text":"This is a great place for teriyaki. I got the white meat chicken teriyaki and it was excellent. The quality was great, sauce was very tasty, and the service was great with very kind and friendly employees. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I write this review with a degree of sadness. Yoko's was a place I used to frequent at least once a week. Partly because I lived about 3 minutes away, and partly because it was quick, fast and tasty Japanese/Chinese food. Not authentic, but it was a good place to chow down on some Americanized Asian cuisine.

That was 4 years ago. It's gone downhill since then. The place is still the same physically. But as far as food, they went from fresh, tasty chicken in their dishes to rubbery bland chicken. The sauces are not up to snuff anymore. It's evident they've switched suppliers for whatever reason and it's just not worth the trip.

I think the place survives by virtue of Mesa High School being within walking distance of the place and not due to the quality of the food. It's edible, but that's about as far as it goes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. My family has been going here ever since it opened! My favorites are the kaum poong kee, teriyaki chicken, and house chicken (or beef is great too!)"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the restaurant was clean and  smelled amazing. The staff was friendly and fast. Definitely eating here again."}
{"text":"Seriously good and good value. Went there for the first time this week because we saw it on a jog. The worker was very nice and informational and the food he suggested was amazing. Like others said the crab angels are a must!!!! We were told this place has been open for 19 years with the same owner and menu so it has to be good! It was so worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Yoko Fast Food for nearly 20 years.  I'm from Michigan and this place is very similar to the Chinese food from that area.  The owners have always been extremely friendly and in my opinion the Asian cuisine is the best in AZ.  I highly recommend the Orange Chicken, Green Pepper Beef, and Yakisoba w/beef.  However the Sweet & Sour chicken is also tasty.  If you're looking for good fried rice I suggest their Yakimeshi.  I hope some day they will add Almond Boneless Chicken (aka War Su Gai) to their menu.  Regardless Yoko Fast Food is a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Place is delicious! I love all the chicken dishes. Make sure you get a egg roll on the side, they are home made and bomb .com"}
{"text":"Been going here since high school and I've never been disappointed. Love the food and the service is great always! Yum :)"}
{"text":"Good food, poeple are nice.  I took my wife and kids there. They loved it. They were nice to my kids every friendly environment."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest service didn't even acknowledge I entered the restaurant.  I ordered orange chicken and it was ok. Ive had better .. rice Was lumpy"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Yoko Fast Food.  It is definitely my go to local joint for quick and cheap eats, and it doesn't hurt that everything I've had there is F***ing delicious!

I personally love the Sukiayaki Bowl, Katsu, Orange Chicken, and Hot and Sour Soup.  My go to is the Beef Yakisoba, but the Chicken Yakisoba is great as well.

Beyond that, I cannot count how many times I've put in an order and its been ready in half the time it takes me to get there!  Highly recommend Yoko for your next takeout adventure!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have never had something there I didn't like. Orange chicken/ beef, garlic chicken, teriyaki chicken and the pan fried dumplings are our favorites! The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. If you have any questions or want a recommendation they are always there to help."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Mesa. My brothers discovered it and we've all been going there for years. I always get the teriyaki beef which is fantastic. Also love that its family owned. Love them!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over two decades! I dig the family owned and operated vibe. Great food and OG!"}
{"text":"The service is great! But the sauce is always drowning my rice!! My crispy orange chicken is now a sad soggy chicken. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Quick service for take out, tasty teriyaki chicken. I was not as impressed by the orange chicken, frier may have been a bit cool that day. Good variety and good prices."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great customer service, affordable prices...my go-to place while in Mesa for a great lunch every time!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Been going here for 20ish years and haven't had a bad experience once. The staff is friendly and professional. The food is fresh and good. House chicken is so good! The prices are fair and a good value for the portions of food. Also, they are fast. If you're in a hurry and in a rush, stop in and try the house chicken."}
{"text":"I love the food , it's all natural , the taste is awesome , the family is friendly and great customer service , I highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Can't get this much high quality food ANYWHERE! Really good Asian food. I had the kaum poong kee and the crab angels. Do yourself a favor and try both! Alex, the owner, is super nice and treats every customer like family. Would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Kaum pong kee Is my favorite but I also enjoy the orange chicken.  Their California rolls are also really good. The food is good and it's clean. That works for me."}
{"text":"Very close to where I lived but it just didn't cut it for me, I gave it 2 tries. Food is bland and just nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food, tucked in the mall close to the Little Einstein daycare. We ordered 2 regular dishes and one large order of Sukiyaki Beef! It's the best take out sukiyaki beef I've had ever!! Yummy! The chicken teriyaki is also very good, great sauce on top - just the right amount and I'm sure we are gonna love the yakisoba - I'm told they only use fresh soba! I will definitely come back to eat in and to order take out!"}
{"text":"Great food. Have been coming here for years and am never disappointed. Don't let bad reviews detour you! This place is bomb!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Very friendly and fast service and the staff was knowledgeable about the dishes. The food was delicious, hot and fresh. The prices were very reasonable at about $5 for a sushi roll. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone craving sushi/Asian food."}
{"text":"For fast food it's awesome... I moved to Los Angeles and I always think about going back to get some of my favorite dishes.

Not only is the food great, the people who work there are really nice.

I've never had any issues with the food quality and I've been there many times. 

If you're going to get take out or a quick bite. This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"It was past the lunch hour when I came here and people were still coming in, mostly to order or pick up take-out. I can see why this is a popular eatery. The location is convenient, though if it's your first time here, the address might throw you off - it's on the Southern Av side of the commercial complex, not facing Gilbert Rd. The food is very inexpensive, it's a family-run small business, and the service is fast and friendly. The food is an Americanized take on Asian cuisine. I ordered a sukiyaki bowl; it was tasty though the sweetness of the sauce could have been toned down a bit.  I also had a salmon roll and it is a good example of the value that attracts so many people: an entire roll (8 pieces) for only $3.97; the salmon was fresh, though the rice did not have the slightest hint of rice vinegar (sushi rice is a vinegared rice). So, no flavor fireworks here but the food is decent and very inexpensive and the service is great, so you get good value for your money."}
{"text":"Whammy! If you enjoy inexpensive Japanese Cuisine like I do, then this is the place. This family operated establishment, from what I was told, has been in the business for over a decade and they have always held on to their signature style and flavor. Portions are great and inexpensive, and while that seem to deter the flavor- it certainly doesn't. Try it out!"}
{"text":"The food is bombbb!!! Lots of regulars. Seems like that local family place that everyone likes. I ordered the kaum poong kee, which was basically deep fried chicken covered in sweet and savory sauce. With the house-made hot sauce, the dish was out of this world. With the friendly service, i dont see a reason why i wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"Great food and pretty quick. The large bowls have more rice than meat, but it's tasty. For as much rice, the price should be at least a buck less. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Not great but good. I would return though and try other stuff. I do like that its locally owned and operated. I noticed that the people coming in seemed to be regulars and the customers seemed to know each other. Maybe I'll update my review after trying other stuff."}
{"text":"This place is hidden gem!  When I walked in the place was empty and employees were cleaning. You can partially see the kitchen and it was spotless.  Everyone there was happy and friendly. The food was to die for.  I ordered the hot & sour soup and it was the best I've ever had and it even had thin little magical strips of pork.  The egg rolls and dumplings tasted great and that they were made on site.    I also ordered the orange chicken and the sauce tasted fresh and not from a bottle.  I couldn't stop eating it and regretted not getting the large. The best was the homemade hot sauce.  While waiting for my food I saw that they were very busy with orders to go.  I can't wait to share this place with others."}
{"text":"This place has been my staple \"goto\" since
I could drive.. even from thousands of miles away, I would get take out. 'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Been going here for about 18 years. I always get the all white meat chicken teriyaki. There isn't another place like it around. Their sauce is perfect. Great lunch spot. Family owned and very friendly. They love to get to know you and make you feel like family. I've brought many coworkers here and they all love it."}
{"text":"Same great food & service - even after not eating here for 10 years... hot, fresh, great flavor and quality of food. 
The Kaum Poong Kee (#12) is prepared fresh to order and is a personal and customer favorite. So are the Katsu & Oyako good choices for authentic, quick service food. 
There is a charge for refills on drinks, a charge for Credit Card purchases under $10, and no more Gomashio salt on the tables, but this is my new replacement for the now defunct Tokyo Express of years ago for quick service Japanese food.

{"text":"My wife loves this place,  me not so much. I like a good teriyaki chicken.  This place didn't have it. The teriyaki sauce is runny and just pools in the bottom of the bowl.  The vegetables had seen better days, some were obviously past their prime and the rice isn't what I have come to expect from an Asian restaurant;  It isn't sticky and is hard to eat with chop sticks. Disappointed,  yet reluctantly continue to go for my wife. That's true love there."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've eaten orange chicken all over the world and their's is the best hands down. I also highly recommend their crab angels (they're crab wontons) and their yoko noodle soup (spicy). I've never had a bad dish here but I'm addicted to the orange chicken. Great prices and fast service."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. I ordered the chicken katsu and it looked like a giant pile of mush. I don't understand why this place is well rated. It's pretty terrible food."}
{"text":"By far the best, freshest, most authentic Japanese food. Yokohama is one of our favorite places to eat. The food is fresh and made to order. It's always hot. The staff is very friendly. The restaurant is clean and kept up. The price is awesome for the amount of food you get. Definitely a must try! 

Update: 9/2/16: We received awful customer service this evening. We asked for the smallest cup for our 2 1/2 yr old daughter and they informed us that it is a water cup. I stated that I'm aware that it is but that we won't be drinking water in it, so if they need to charge for a small, that's fine. The owners son turned his head rolled his eyes and proceeded to talk crap to the other gentleman behind the counter. No thank you. That is not ok. We will not be back here."}
{"text":"Best meat and rice you can buy in Mesa. They do it the right way, make it taste great and with no grease. Would recommend to anyway. Very delicious."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the services was amazing! I had the orange chicken. It tastes fresh with just the right amount of citrus flair."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Yakisoba and egg rolls in the valley! I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"I've gone here for 15 years and the food has always been consistent and good.  After trying everything on the menu, the #12 Kaum Pong Kee is by far my favorite - battered chicken in a sweet garlic glaze that saturates the rice and makes my mouth water.  Other favorites are Katsu, sukiyaki, and yakisoba.  Lemon chicken is the only thing I don't really like here."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 13 years and always get great customer service which is why I continue to come and enjoy their great food."}
{"text":"Been here twice, had the kaum poong kee and orange chicken. The orange chicken was great, but the kaum poong kee was really amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it. 

Also, there are 3 combo meals - sweet & sour chicken + teriyaki chicken, or orange chicken + yakisoba, or kaum poong kee + house chicken - plus rice and drink for only about $8. You won't find many other places where you can get large portions of tasty food for such good prices."}
{"text":"The teriyaki beef bowel is by far their best item on the menu. The place is clean and they deliver fast service.  The only downside are the 2 male asian owners I wish they would be friendlier, it seems as if sometimes it's a burden on them when you order food. I will definitely return. They should move the 2 guys to the back, it would be better for business."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time after seeing the great reviews and being in the area.  Super friendly staff.  The guy helped us with our order since it was our first time and he was very thorough explaining the menu and giving suggestions.  Got the sukiyaki, teriyaki beef, and crab angles.  Pretty good for being fast food.  Teriyaki beef was a little too much sweetness.  Would come back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident today, and I'm glad I did.  The service was quick and personable, the food was great, and the portions were generous.  Annie at the front was delightful to speak with, and made sure to include napkins, soy, chopsticks, and a fork, which I was grateful for, as I definitely overestimated my chopstick skills.  The pricing was surprisingly reasonable-  I had a heaping bowl of teriyaki beef and a large drink for under $10, which was enough for two full meals.  

After being impressed by the service, the food, and the pricing, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good for quick asian food. I am a big fan of their miso and hot and sour soup. The prices are fair and the portions are okay. The crab angels are delicious and they have pretty decent chicken teriyaki. I like their low carb bowls too!"}
{"text":"The brother and I used to frequent this restaurant as the food \"really\" is good. Fresh, tasty and generous portions. However....
My brother stopped frequenting this place when he got home, realized he had received \"dark meat\" chicken when he specifically asked for white meat. I'm thinking.. No big deal. We're less than a mile away, quit bein a big baby and go have her change it. I'm sure it won't be a problem. WRONG. We return to the establishment only for the little old lady to get defensive when he tells her that he ordered something different. She actually \"argues\" with him telling him what he ordered instead of taking care of it. Me being completely self centered, every man for himself kinda guy (disgusting, I know) i shrug it off thinking..  We'll damn, glad they got my order right. He has refused to eat there since that day. I however continued to patronize the place like my dirty little secret, if the food wasn't so effing good and convenient. I kept it a secret to the brother knowing he was rioting then realized how much more enjoyable it was to just eat the delicious morsels in front of him slowly blowing the aroma his way and seeing his disgust.
I frequented this place enough to the point of having a \"Yoko\" card in my wallet. I was super excited to have filled the card completely (10 previous meals) 11th free. I guarded this thing with my life like Smeagol in The Lord of the rings.  I couldn't give a flying f*** about the 6 bucks. Honestly. It was the fact I \"earned\" this meal and I wanted it so I drove out of my way to get it. I don't care who you are. \"Everybody\" loves something free especially when it is earned. 
I walk into this establishment, and peer over at the little old lady. I ask for a orange chicken bowl (all us white people eat the same shit) don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.  I proceed to pull my golden ticket from my wallet glistening with 10 previous signatures of theirs awarding me my prize that's been nestled in my wallet. Little old lady looks at the card, doesn't say anything for 15 seconds then replies..  \"This guy that signed this box (points to the 3rd box) has been gone for 5 years.\" I'm thinking in my head..   
That's a shame, I don't care, I'm hungry, feed me. I made a comment how I must be getting old. Then realized she was being serious. I thought for a second maybe old lady enjoyed my company and threw a joke my way. Wrong again Preston. 
She didn't like your lame joke, and she didn't like your sole being of existence standing before her like you just gave her a counterfeit 50 dollar bill.  She continued to exclaim that the card was of no use to me because I \"kept card in my wallet too long.\"  I explained to her that I have not even \"lived\" here for 5 years. I just discovered Yoko 1.5-2 years ago. She repeated the same thing several times which reminded me of when my DVD player freezes and repeats the same shit until you smack it. I slid my two $5 bills of the counter and proceeded to walk out while we continuously argued in front of other customers because she was determined to be the one in the right. 
It's a shame, as I being a business owner would \"never\" handle a customer in the same fashion.  And the \"only\" reason I gave 3 stars is because the son that basically runs the place is top notch. Remembers your name, what you usually order etc. And did I forget to mention the food is terrific?
However, now I shall live in a world with the Soup Natzi within walking distance from my house.  
My advice to anyone going there while she is on shift would be to walk in with your mouth shut, keep your head down, order, leave the corny jokes aside and be appreciative you get to eat that shit because she probably threw 10 other full grown men out of there that week so there would be room for you to enjoy your f****** meal.

No soup for you!"}
{"text":"Best Asian food around. Can't go wrong with teriyaki beef or the house chicken. I could go there everyday and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"A gem in east central Mesa.  I have been a customer of Yoko since they opened in the nineties.  I introduced my wife to this place a few years ago and it is a favorite for both of us now.  They have three combo meals that all contain some of their most popular items.    We like combo A and B.  But C is delicious as well.  The guy that owns it is always friendly to us and does a great job managing the place.  If you are looking for great Japanese food from family recipes, go to Yoko!"}
{"text":"Love the take on Japanese cuisine. 
Haven't had anything here I didn't like. 
The owner are always there and amazing 
They have homemade hot sauce .. most places just have oil and chill mix but this is a chunky mix of hot flavor full sauce."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is amazing! The food is always fresh and tasty! They have healthy options like brown rice and low carb. I love their version of Japanese Fried Rice and their House Chicken is really good as well! I wish Yoko Fast Food was closer to me but it is so worth the drive!"}
{"text":"My expectations for a self-professed Japanese \"fast food\" place were not high. I would have settled for a Panda Express type of food, but this was much better. For less than $5.50 I got a bowl of white rice topped with orange chicken, scallions, two large red pepper pods, and a wonderful orange sauce with bits cooked orange rinds and a fresh orange slice on top. 

The chicken was all white meat, battered and fried. The only thing I would have changed is that I prefer brown rice or fried rice to white rice, but they do not have that option. The food was indeed ready \"fast.\"

Parking is right at the door and the staff is friendly and checks in with you to see if you need anything else. There is a tv in the eating area (tables and chairs) tuned to a cable station. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very reasonable and tasty Japanese fast food.  I ordered white meat chicken teriyaki bowl and a handmade eggroll which were delicious and very filling. I spent less than $20 on food and even bought a shirt to commemorate my first visit. Everyone was friendly and quick. I highly recommend Yoko if you like good food!"}
{"text":"Better than average Asian food for a take-out restaurant. Get their crab angels though. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Spectacular service, spectacular food.  I have been going to this place for almost 2 decades. The owners and I quickly became friendly. And realizing the son is my age we all became close.  
Not a month goes by with out me eating here 2-4 times.  Love it here and great place to eat/study!!!
Alex the owner is always attentive and ready to help at any time"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Yoko's my junior year of High School when my friend Takoda came in with Yoko's teriyaki beef bowl. It was so freaking good. It became my go to place for when I was hungry. The staff is EXTREMELY friendly. I love Alex. He's awesome! I usually stick to my absolute favorite which is the beef and broccoli, but Alex is really good at talking me into ordering other things on the menu and I always cave. I never ever regret trying something else though. I'm super picky yet something always fits my needs on the menu. ;) I've been out of high school for a year now & I'm showing up at Yoko even more than I ever have. It's been mine and my boyfriends favorite place for a few years. Speedy fast and friendly service & the best food you'll ever taste! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"One of the best places hands down ! I Stop in every time I'm in the area, great family business and very humble people! Great for lunch and dinner. The place has someone in ordering or picking up  no matter what time of day it is. chicken bowls are amazing especially if your some what on a diet chicken and rice is the way to go! If you haven't tried it already I HIGHLY suggest you stop in, defiantly need more locations, would be a great idea! - never disappointed !"}
{"text":"Best oriental food I have had in the area. Clean restaurant. The Japanese man at the front counter is nice, and speaks very clear English. I have to say he did came across a bit cocky though when taking our order. 
The name of the restaurant is odd. The food prep isnt fast and doesn't taste like fast food at all. 
It took about 10 min for our food and no one else was ordering. It was well worth the wait.
Awesome food. Fresh. Not too salty.
The bill was $16.00 for 2 of us.
We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here with another couple and had outstanding great service. Nico (hope that is the right spelling) took time to explain the menu to my wife and I. The food portions were huge, even on the regular bowl. My teriyaki chicken bowl was most excellent. The sauce was tasty and had just the right amount to flavor everything perfectly. The owner even came out to meet us and sat with us to chat for a while. A very unreasonable person came in and started to make a scene about something completely absurd, and Alex the owner handled it with a professional and graceful attitude. We were all very impressed. 
I want to come back here any time I am on this side of town!! You can't go wrong with Yoko!!"}
{"text":"Very nice, friendly place.
Food was hot, fresh and quick. 
Will definitely recommend this for any one that enjoys good Asian food.
Priced right for lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best choices in mesa! Teriyaki chicken and crab angels are a must for first timers. Always fast, always fresh! Cozy place inside with a clean atmosphere! Family run, the mother runs the counter during the day, the son at night, and the father in the kitchen. A true gem! Must try!"}
{"text":"Very solid 4... and here's why not a 5...

I hate when places charge an extra .50c for using a debit card, it's not credit, you don't get dinged for charging a debit card, quit charging me!  They also charge extra for refills if you want one... but they do have HUGE mongous cups so that's not a big worry.

Pretty much the best orange chicken I've ever had though, and for a fast food type place - it's the best.  The sauce is just so damn good.  
I've also had yaki soba from here and that was delish

Just a quick good meal for lunch and/or dinner... been many times - I'll be back"}
{"text":"I patronize this family owned restaurant whenever I am in the area.  Have been coming here for many years and it is just as good as the 1st time I ate here.  I always appreciate consistency.  The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is clean.

I'm a creature of habit and like what I like and always order the same thing, teriyaki beef.  They simply have the best teriyaki beef that I have ever tasted.  The quality of meat is excellent and its a bit crispy and oh so wonderful in their teriyaki sauce.  I just wish they were closer to my home. 

They have counter ordering and will call you when ready.  Their main dining area seats 15, however they have additional seating and or a banquet room once the main dining is busy.  They also have a few tables outside in which you can view the beautiful bird of paradise flowers."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. My husband and I come here every once in a while when we want some delish Japanese cuisine. Lemon chicken is my go too, while he loves the orange beef or chicken. Crab Angels are a must. Filled! With cream cheese. Its always the same friendly faces when we come in. Pretty sure its family owned. Excellent food and very good prices. Ide rather support small businesses like this, than go to Panda or another chain. Their meat is always juicy and fresh. I don't feel too full after eating a hearty meal :)
Thank you guys for your love of food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 20 years. Same family owns it still but now the son operates it. The food has always been consistently fresh, piping hot and delicious. They also have the highest of standards on cleanliness. My all time favorite is the green pepper beef. My family also loves the orange chicken and shrimp yakisoba. Delicious"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a giant bowl of rice, with a few veggies and meat on top, this is your place. One of our bowls had a hair and a bone in it. Eat slow."}
{"text":"The food is OK but I will not be returning.  Simply put the price and add-ons (debit surcharge, soft drink refill cost) are not customer friendly.  This place could be a local gem but they need to work on customer appreciation."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent prices. Always fast service. Love the #1 it always hits the spot. I wish they had more sauce and maybe less rice but can't complain for $7"}
{"text":"I love local run shops! I love when the owners are friendly with their cliental. This was my 1st time to Yoko, but I have to say I'm sure it won't be my last!   

I ordered the orange chicken bowl, and now if you're thinking panda express chicken man you are off base. This is fresh orange chicken, with slices of fresh orange rinds in the sauce. It was a clean orange taste, very delish!  Was impressed."}
{"text":"Yoko is the place to go for your Japanese / Chinese food! Just moved here 7 months ago and so glad I found this joint! Everyone is always so friendly and great to deal with! The food is outstanding and the best around! They also have a stamp card for every $6 you spend you get stamped. After 11 or 12 you get a free entree! Awesome incentive to give back to your customers! Never been disappointed and don't think I ever will be!"}
{"text":"I heard from my coworkers that Yoko was a great place to eat to get something fast and delicious. Located in a quiet Mesa suburban area the location was relatively easy to find. I ordered the kaum poong kee, it came out in about 7-10 minutes which allowed me to observe the aesthetically pleasing interior of the restaurant. Now let me tell you I am a tough customer to please.. when i took my first bite it was a sensation that i have never experienced before. It allowed me to appreciate all the beauties in life and so much more!! The tenderness of the chicken blew me away, not to mention the flavor was out of this world!! The workers were also very nice (and surprisingly fairly goodlooking!). I will definitely be back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted immediately, the staff is very friendly, and helpful. The food is so fresh, and delicious. The Lemon, and Orange Chicken two of the Best I have ever tasted. My family, and I will be coming back. Keep up the Great Service, and Awesome Food."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  Nice, quiet fast food place with room to sit and enjoy your meal.  Very quick and friendly service.  Could not be happier with the quality and taste of the food.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap and very good quality Asian food, this is your place! Sushi is great!"}
{"text":"Yoko's has the absolute best food! The noodles are my favorite and a \"go-to\" when I'm craving Japanese! The staff is also super friendly and nice! Big shoutout to James who is always helpful and super nice! Thanks for always hitting a cuisine high spot for me!"}
{"text":"Yoko has become our go to cook to order Japanese food. Everything is hot and fresh! I really like the teriyaki chicken. The regular bowl is filling but a large bowl will fill the biggest appetite too. The restaurant is clean and tightly run. Store size is small but I've always found a table. Prices are good and menu is just right with options. 
This is a fast food environment and calling in take out too. There are no table servers and a couple tables outside. They do have a couple TV sets running sports or news. I recommend this mom and pop restaurant for its cook to order fast food any day over a chain restaurant. Go local businesses whenever possible!!"}
{"text":"Food is really good!  They made me what I wanted with the sauce I wanted.   Nice owners too!   The miso soup is good.... lot of food"}
{"text":"The best Asian food in the valley! The egg rolls are the very best! I usually get the yakisoba which is delicious chow mien. Spoke with the owner and he's very nice and hospitable."}
{"text":"I wanted a vegetable yakisoba and was told that I would get charged for meat and so I asked for it on the side and they said no and I still had to pay for it"}
{"text":"First off I must say the portions and prices are amazing. I have been going here for about 6 years and must say I have yet to find better japanese fast food. I love getting there chicken Yakisoba extra spicy. They're one of the only places I know that but a bed of white rice underneath the noodles."}
{"text":"I came from Utah to Arizona to spend time with my sister in law and my new niece, and she raved and claimed many good things about the food at Yoko's.  When we went, the service was a bit iffy.  They were a little impatient, especially after I said \"I'm not from here, I've never been here, I have no idea what to order\" many times, but I was expected to make a decision on the spot.  I had the teriyaki chicken and it was pretty good.  It was nothing to write home about, but it satisfied a Japanese craving I had.  While we were eating, the same rude and impatient lady who took our order came to our table and oo-ed and aw-ed over my niece, making things a little uncomfortable.  It was an alright experience, but it's not something I'd fly to Arizona to have again."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! 
The cashiers are so friendly (at least one of the two I've encountered is. The other is standoff-ish) and the first time I went he took the time to walk us through the menu and check up on us during the meal.
I've had the rice noodle bowl (forgot the name) which was pretty average. I've also got the sweet and sour chicken which was way too sweet for my taste. My favorite here is the chicken teriyaki. It's the best I've had anywhere and their homemade hot sauce is too die for. It's like sriracha with way more flavor. $6 for the large chicken teriyaki bowl will last you two meals!! Check it out but stick to the teriyaki chicken!"}
{"text":"I'm from the Los Angeles area, the mecca of all good eats. So, believe me when I say this, there really isn't anything good to eat in Arizona.

That said, Yoko is one of the very few places that I frequent when I'm in the area. It is definitely on par with, if not better than, most of the Asian/Japanese fast food joints in LA. Allow me to explain why this is the case.

1. The food is freshly prepared from scratch. (In this day and age, few businesses can lay claim to this kind of practice because it is, dare I say it, honest) The orange chicken is my favorite item because, as names should suggest, the sauce is actually made with real oranges and the meat undeniably comes from chickens. I have asked the friendly, elderly Asian man (presumably the owner) on a number of occasions for the recipe for the awesome teriyaki sauce. No surprise, it is a closely guarded family secret - and with good reason.

2. Some have commented about the decor of this establishment. I believe that this is a ridiculous criticism leveled at the restaurant owners. Take your pathetic sensitivity elsewhere. This is a casual, family-operated, fast food restaurant, not PF Chang's. (And if you're eating at PF Changs, I question your tastes) If anything, I am fond of the modest decor of Yoko because it isn't distracting. The owners have focused on bringing the customer an affordable, delicious meal. This is commendable. You should focus on your meal as well.

3. The business is family-operated. The employees are genuine people and I always appreciate interacting with them at a level beyond my order. One reviewer commented that he/she was offended because an associate shared his/her gun control views. This is laughable. I guess freedom of speech stops short of restaurant and small business owners.

Trust me on this one. Yoko provides excellent food and service at a reasonable price. It is definitely worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Alex and his family do an incredible job! Friendly atmosphere, great food and fast. Crab angels are great, as are the California rolls and teriyaki."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time earlier this week since I was in the area and read the great reviews on Yelp, and was completely disappointed. I ordered the house chicken and the flavor was too overwhelming and the veggies were soggy. I also ordered their vegetarian roll and thought it was gross - instead of putting in a ton of veggies, all it had in it was avocado, cucumber, and cream cheese.. And about 90% of the filling was cream cheese....

Cream cheese sushi = not cool.

Seriously, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love love love Yoko's!!! I used to go here in college and high school. I moved away and finally went back 10 years later and the good still tastes the same! If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Food is delicious, my fav is the house of beef. Orange chicken and Kam paogee? Is good. So is their seafood bowl and their ragoons. Friendly people. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I love family owned, authentic restaurants! I came here to pick up some lunch for work. Got a chicken teriyaki bowl, a pork katsu bowl, and a curry katsu bowl (this only game in a large). Everyone loved the food! It was about a 15 minute drive back but it still stayed piping hot!

I'm gonna come back for sushi. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing as always. I've been going to this place for a couple years now and you just cannot beat the food here. I absolutely love the food here and the employees. Can't recommend this place enough for people looking for affordable, friendly, and good food."}
{"text":"It's close, locally owned, and fast! I wanted to like them, so bad I went last week and again this week. Yakisoba ... Not bad, but it was better reheated actually. The layer of white rice underneath the noodles was half my portion and that was a bummer. As for the teriyaki, I picked it up on my way to work. Basically it was was grilled chicken with a few green onions and sesame seeds. Teriyaki with no teriyaki sauce? Strange."}
{"text":"Going here the other day was a flood of memories for me. I have been eating at Yoko since I was a child. My dad would take me here. It has always been owner operated and has great service. When I was younger we would occasionally see the owner's boy playing around the restaurant. Since they retired he now took over ownership. 
The food is still fantastic!  #12 has been my go to for as long as I can remember. My food is always piping hot when I get it and I've never found anything anywhere else quite like it. I now have a family of my own and bring them here to carry on the tradition."}
{"text":"Yoko is pretty good, prices are just right and service is friendly and prompt. I would recommend this to someone."}
{"text":"Better food for a better price than pretty much any restaurant in this area, I get the orange chicken almost daily and it is handsdown some of the best most consistent orange chicken I've ever had. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that likes good quality food at a relatively low price. 5*"}
{"text":"small family owned spot. fresh ingredients and quality food. prices are great as well."}
{"text":"I plan on being a lifetime customer to Yoko, my go to spot for fast food Japanese. I walk in and have my order read to me w/o saying a word. Alex treats us like family from the moment we walk in till we get in our cars to leave. Highly recommend Yoko to you and your family. They are a class act business!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My husband and I are never disappointed when we eat here! Everything we have had has been great. Such a gem! The crab angels are soooo good and so are the egg rolls for a nice little starter. Try it!"}
{"text":"Thanks to this place, I can not enjoy Japanese take out food anywhere else in the entire Phoenix area.  This is your mom and pop's style restaurant that gives you much more for your dollar.  The quality and quantity of food that you get at this place is superior than your...let's say than like a Panda Express?  

Let's just do a quick comparison of the Orange Chicken.
Yoko's: you take a bite out of the deep fried chicken and you will find quality white meat.
Panda: you take a bite out of the deep fried chicken and you will find a \"what the hell is that??\" type of meat.

Enough said.

Also, this is probably the only place you will find handmade gyoza (potstickers) in Arizona.  The owner prepares each gyoza filled with pork/vegetable stuffing and he also makes his own gyoza skin!  he rolls out each gyoza skin by hand, which is a lost art form.  For an order of 5, it'll run you about $6, but they are well worth it.  At other restaurants, you'll most likely find frozen gyozas from costco that are just deep fried.

Again....enough said."}
{"text":"I've been going to Yoko Fast Food for a couple of years now.  It's not fancy fine dining, but for something quick, it fits the bill quite nicely.  While Yoko Fast Food is primarily Japanese cuisine (like teriyaki chicken, katsu bowl, sukiyaki bowl, and sushi), they also serve an assortment of other, more general Asian type dishes.  I suppose it might be comparable to something like Panda Express.  Except in my opinion, Yoko's food is better quality and more reasonable for the price.  And the experience is definitely more personable too.  

The food is quite generous.  Even the small rice bowls are very filling.  You can also ask for a low-carb option on the main entrees (no rice, extra vegetables) or get brown rice as a substitute for the normal steamed white rice.  Yoko Fast Food also has nice trimmings like delicious crab puffs and gyoza.  All in all, I've always been satisfied whenever I go.

I would take notice that drink refills are not free however (50 cents), and they charge 50 cents for debit/credit transactions under $10.  Nonetheless, I think your stomach will leave happy."}
{"text":"This place tastes like the good cheap Chinese/Japanese food that you get that craving for every once in a while and have a hard time finding. Not the commercial taste like Panda Express but a freshly made and delicious. I get the orange chicken and pork egg roll both are very good and orange chicken is sauced just right every time. All the dishes come on a bed of rice which I enjoy because it adds to the meal, but you can always order without. Egg rolls are crisp and taste freshly made. My only complaint is that the yakisoba I had recently was heavy on the soy sauce which made it too salty but I think that was a one time thing also they are not open on Sunday. I will still go back since that has never happened before. Overall I really like this place. It's a must go."}
{"text":"These guys get 5 stars just for being one of the few places in town that serve healthy food. It tastes good and actually resembles food I might make at home. I get tired of restaurants that serve too rich of food and don't cater to people that actually want to feel good after they eat. You'll feel good about yourself if you eat here."}
{"text":"I\"ve stopped here a number of times.  Each time I get something different.  It has ALL been good.  The restaurant itself may not be anything fancy, but it keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy food, I had a Tuna roll and it was really good the Sukiyaki bowl was good too but I was told it was clear noodles and nothing about any rice inside when I asked... 10% noodles and 60% everything on the bottom rice which was disappointing I didn't really want to pay for a whole bowl of rice. Staff was friendly and service was fast. Was not in a very good location."}
{"text":"My family loves Yoko! We have been eating here for years.  It's a clean, friendly family owned business with Awesome food. Please note, they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I started to frequent yoko since my traditional Japanese fast food restaurant closed. Yoko has good service and I would recommend that if its your first time there try the teriyaki beef bowel.  The sushi is average but it's fast food."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to explain how great this place is! I've been going here since I was in high school. The food is amazing and the family that owns this hot spot is great as well. Crab angels and the teriyaki beef are my favorite but even when venturing out and trying new things on the menu, it never disappoints! I always look forward to coming here for an awesome lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"The staff is always so kind and the food is absolutely delicious! After my study abroad program in Tokyo, I tried finding authentic Japanese Don dishes and Yoko's food (especially their Oyakodonburi) brings me back! Give it a try and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Their Yakisoba (Chow Mein) over white rice is just so good. Folks are top notch friendly. I've tried many places nearby, but Yoko has earned my business. Just no reason to go anywhere else at this point."}
{"text":"Yum!!! I've been coming here since I was a little girl and I still love it!! Their food is so flavorful and their staff is so kind and friendly!!! Definitely worth trying!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick, healthy, and delicious lunch. I usually get the House Chicken with Hot and Sour soup, but everything I've had there has been completely delicious. Love the friendly and efficient staff, too."}
{"text":"Love the sukiyaki beef. They are very nice and when I call in an order it is ready by the time I am able to drive my Lamborghini there to pick it up. Also I don't have a Lamborghini."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great service and all around good people!!!! We definitely will be a returning customer"}
{"text":"So many good options to choose from snd they are super quick! My go to choice is the #12."}
{"text":"I happened to drive past this place many times because I work close by. One day I needed to get grab a quick lunch and went in and I was very surprised. The place is small up front but kept clean, and they have an extra seating area to the left. The food was so bomb. I had the sukiyaki bowl that had steak, veggies, sweet potato noodles, and this delicious savory sauce all on a bed of rice. It was SO good, and the staff was super friendly to me.  I dream of going back at times just for their terriyaki beef and sukiyaki bowl. It is so damn good!!"}
{"text":"My favorite is the Kaum Poong Key (garlic chicken). The crab Angels are excellent as well!"}
{"text":"We went here yesterday looking for a good Katsu. Oh boy did we find so much more. They have been in business since 93, which  makes absolute sense, once you taste there food. I was told the only thing the owners son (who was our cashier) said he was not a fan of was the lemon chicken. Me being a LEMON LOVER, I had to try it, even with that explanation. We also got the spicy orange chicken and pork Katsu. All of it was delectable. The customer service is right on par with the food as well. They definitely know how to make you feel welcome and satisfied. I would not pass this place up if you have a chance to try it ."}
{"text":"Best lemon chicken I have ever had. Fresh lemony and not too sweet. A friendly family restaurant. Love coming here for dinner and for lunch."}
{"text":"Went tonight after pregnancy craving for teriyaki bowls. SERVICE WAS AMAZING!!! The gal working the counter blew my socks off and was so kind and friendly. The food was perfect and I can't wait to try more things on the menu. Can't believe I live down the street and never been here before. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki chicken, which was pretty good and very flavorful. The cashier, who seemed to be the owners son, was rude and could not crack a smile or thank me for my business. He loudly spouted off his views on gun control, which I think as an associate was inappropriate. He also got into a verbal disagreement with the customer ahead of me due to the fact that the associate would not get off the phone with his father to assist the paying customer. He yelled at the customer and was extremely disrespectful. I didn't appreciate the way I was treated, and I can certainly find a chicken teriyaki elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and every time I get something different. When I'm not sure what's in the food the staff always explains to me absolutely everything giving the impression that they know the recipe from memory. Everything I've tried was hot, fresh, and delicious. I recommend this place to anyone I know that loves Asian food. This is by far my favorite local restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We've never had anything bad from here. The yakisoba is great and my husband likes the double happiness. The crab puffs are yummy as well. Make sure to ask for soy sauce. Great customer service.  Make sure to check the day and time before heading here. I think they're closed on Sunday's."}
{"text":"I am going to say first that to food here is good.  I've tried several dishes and they were all good.  And that is why I gave them two stars and not one.

I moved to the area and discovered Yoko within the last year, and at some points was having yoko once a week.  The guy that works the counter (I believe the son of the owner), usually helped us, and recognizes us now.  He was never unfriendly, but he was never amiable.  The last time I went the woman (his mom) was working the front counter and we placed our order.  The gentleman came out and put it into the cash register and took our card... We've been there dozens times within the last few months... So as we were sitting down waiting for our order to come up another man walks in, orders, pulls out a punch card, and then waits for his order.

Never once, in the dozens of times that we have been there have we ever been offered a punch card.  Not that I need a stupid $6 free meal, but that is f***ed up.  

After reading other reviews online about the service and punch cards, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and ordered orange chicken. As soon as we walked in the amazing staff greeted us and chatted with us. The orange chicken was incredible and the staff made sure we were enjoying our food. Great experience and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 15 years. One thing I love about Yoko is their food is consistently good! Always the same taste, never disappoints. Good prices, fairly big portions, and nice people running the joint. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing fast food Chinese place. Good portions and fast service. Plus good food. I'll recommend it to anyone"}
