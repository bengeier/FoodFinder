{"text":"I really hope that the owner or management cares enough about their business to check up on these reviews... I can't give any opinion on the food because I had taken all I could before I was able to try it. I walked in and was told I could sit where I liked, I chose a booth. There was plenty of seating because the place was dead. My waitress asked for my drink order and I asked about specials...she said there were none....I asked for a drink menu and she said they didn't have one, they just had \"the regular stuff\". I ordered a Miller Lite draft...a couple minutes later she came back and said they didn't have Miller on draft so I asked for a bottle. When she asked for my food order I asked for the Ultimate Bacon Platter on the appetizer menu. A few minutes later she returned and said they were out of 2 of the items that were on the platter. When she told me that(with no remorse or empathy) I had experienced all of this establishment that I wanted so I paid for my one beer and left. I will not be returning. My wife and I just moved to Gastonia a few weeks ago and I have been trying to convince her to try it with me because it looked interesting and I obviously love bacon, but she was very resistant....luckily I tried it alone on this occasion so I don't have to hear the \"I told you so\"s."}
{"text":"Worst experience in a really long time.  I waited for about 10 minutes before my order was even taken.  Then my drink order never came so I had to get up and track down the waitress to get it.  30 minutes later when the food finally came it was not even edible.  The hamburger was the worst cooked burger I have ever had.  It was Well, Well, Well Done!  It looked like a burned up hockey puck.  I took two bites and couldn't eat any more.  I will never go back.    STAY AWAY FROM BACON INC."}
{"text":"A local here in Gastonia and was excited to try this place.  It's my sons birthday and he loves bacon, oh my goodness.  It's 2:45 on a Sunday and we ordered drinks and their bacon poppers.....bacon poppers were excellent, then we waited.....waited for over an hour and a half.  We then asked our waitress how much longer and she said they were just now starting our order......needless to say we asked for our check and just left.  Food menu looked great but I think they are catering more to the biker bar atmosphere.  Will not be going back or referring anyone there!  Terrible service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We dined in at dinner time. There were 3 other groups dining there also, seemed like a really slow night. The waitress wasn't trained prior to helping us, she didn't know what drinks they had and once our food came she was asking us about the ingredients in it to see if it was something she would eat.  I ordered the 2/3 lb burger but received and was charged for the 1/3 lb burger. The burger seemed really small for $8 with no sides. We ordered the queso fries appetizer. The fries were the really cheap Walmart brand crinkle cut fries, the queso was good but $7 was too much to ask for the low quality fries. My wife had the bacon wrapped hotdog, it was good the bacon was nice and crispy. She got the chili on the side and it was ground beef with a little seasoning they used almost 1/4 lb of beef in the serving of chili they gave her, it seemed really unbalanced when compared to the size of my burger. Over all I give bacon 2 stars for the hotdog and queso and I will not be returning unless I hear they have made some changes."}
{"text":"Did Super Bowl at this local joint. Had wings and BLT. Nice place. Clean. Organized. Helpful and attentive servers. Tea was too sweet, but food was great. New cooks? Read the negative reviews after spending time there. Only negative complaint would be bar stools are not big booty friendly and appear to be rickety....needs to be more steady. Good location. Nice view of main drag and sweet fountain."}
{"text":"Decidedly average food. Less bacon-centric, more \"This typical bar food would taste better with bacon on it.\" Nothing special.  Pros: Good service, nice location. Cons: The rest of it."}
{"text":"Went there last night with two friends and my wife. This was the most terrible place I have ever been to. Waitress admitted she was new, didn't know the drink menu, when we ordered a appetizer, it never came, nor did my h2o. We waited for 45 min for the food to arrive, while upon looking around, everyone there was waiting. When the food finally arrived, before our appetizer, I asked where was the appetizer? Different waitress brought food, had no clue about the appetizer! Needless to say, here is what we didn't receive, napkins, refills on drinks, ranch for dipping, no offer for desert...I finally went to the bar to ask for refills, which got to the table 10 min later. By this time I had enough, I asked the waitress who the woman was that brought our food, it was the BARTENDER, so I asked who the Mgr. was, she replied Mgr. was gone for the night, and bartender would be acting Mgr.  figure that out!! In closing I give the place 3 months and it will be gone..and good riddance!  DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE WE DID AND GO THERE unless you live for crappy customer treatment.

{"text":"First visit to Bacon was ok. Went back for a second (and last) it was disgusting! Poor, slow service and the food was definitely from the day before. Mac and cheese and potato salad was overly dry as well as the SMALL burger. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Great place"}
{"text":"I'm really shocked about the negative reviews.  I'm generally very picky and I really enjoyed my meal. I think I was lucky and ordered the right thing.  Here's the skinny:  - the Pimento Cheese burger was TO DIE FOR.  The pimento cheese was on point.  Oh so good.  I got the 1/3 lb an could  have easily eaten more.  But I'm glad I went w/ the small portion, i was satiated, but not stuffed.  Very very tasty.    - the boyfriend got the double burger.  It was way too much.  I think he liked my burger better - did I mention the pimento cheese was good?  Anyways, his burger was good, but a a lot.  In general the burgers are very tasty.  The 50/50 bacon makes them juicy and oh so good.  I noticed the waitress did not ask us what temp we wanted our burgers.....but I guess w/ the ground bacon that makes sense.  Both burgers were juicy and a little pink in side, but the exterior was nice and crusty.  - the bacon chips.  Just meh, not bad, but nothing special.  They do come with ranch so I was happy.  Overall we will go back for the pimento burger and that's it.    The service was good - again I'm shocked by the bad reviews.  Any waitress that offers me a to-go cup is A-OK in my book.  Here's my final tip - don't use the restroom.  Yuck.  That's all I say.  Makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like.  For the lack of patrons the bathroom was filthy.  Like hadn't been cleaned in awhile - hairs in the sink and towels on the floor dirty.     PS - the 'chili' is weird.  Boyfriend doesn't like spice so he got it on the side and it really is ground beef with chili spices...for real...it was weird."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpaholics, I am very sad to bring you this review.  I have sunk into a whole new level of depression.  You see, I am the Baconator.  I love Bacon.  I followed Todd Fisher's United States of Bacon TV show, hell Todd and I are Facebook friends......Simply put - Bacon makes me happy, thus this experience has made me resort to a stiff drink as I write this.  By the time I am finished, this will be a long passed nightmare and I will be hammered, well hopefully.......  There is a reason that Bacon Inc. has six 1 star and three 2 star reviews.  The  5 star and 4 star review's must be on Bacon crack.    Fear not fellow Yelpaholics, for I have gone where others Yelpers have avoided, for I have visited the 1 and 2 star joints, hoping for a miraculous meal, and been rewarded.  Sadly, this was not the case......... If this had a ZERO rating, I would have slapped it on without remorse.  Confirmed - The restroom facilities are filthy.  As in sewage filth.  Confirmed - The service was slow.  As in, we were the only people eating and it took 45 minutes.  I had the Stuffed CPR Burger.  This is supposed to be 50% ground beef and 50% bacon.  No bacon.  It was overcooked,the outside was charred/burned.   I ordered lettuce, tomato, bleu cheese, chedder, chili and bacon for toppings.  No bleu cheese.  Chili was Hormel No Beans and NO BACON.  Seriously folks, the name of the place is Bacon Inc. and THERE WAS NO BACON.  WTF?  On the side, for .99 more, I had Bacon Chips.  Over cooked, hard as a rock, fried chips, nothing special, no Bacon, no season, no nothing......  My wife had the Chicken Sandwich.  Frozen chicken breast straight in the deep fryer, makes for breaded rubber.  It was not even tossed in sauce.  To add insult to injury and further to my wife and my deep depression coma, the fries were criss-cut generic supermarket, and not fully cooked.  How do you screw up fries.  I seriously thought any second Jon Taffer would be walking in to kick as and take names.  This place has a zero chance of making it and will not be around much longer."}
{"text":"Don't waist your money here. I rarely complain about food and am definitely not picky.. With that said.... Nasty nasty food. We ordered two different burgers.. One burger with American cheese and the 'carolina burger'. The Carolina burger states it had \"chili\", bleu cheese, coleslaw, mustard and half beef half bacon burger.. Sounds kinda yummy. Well it had coleslaw and a tasteless burger with plain ground beef crumbled on top of it and coleslaw on top of that. No bleu cheese and no mustard. It tasted like dry nastiness. Their \"chili\" is plain ground beef- the server even admitted that. The other cheeseburger was just gross and dry also. Don't waist your time or $$. Go to cookout or something. End rant!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible.  Stopped in on a week night and it wasn't crowded.  Waitress took our drink order promptly and food order also.  Can I say the kitchen was SLOW!!!!  We waited forever for our food and the place wasn't busy.  When our food finally arrived it sucked!!!  It all tasted like frozen food that had been heated up in the deep fryer.  It had no taste and had the consistency of card board.  I love french fries and these were worse than the one's I remember from school lunches!!  I didn't finish any of it.  Do not come here unless your just drinking!!  Oh almost forgot the bathrooms were nasty also.  There was also a funky smell coming from that area to.  Didn't look like they had been cleaned in awhile.  There were empty and half of beers sitting on the back of the toilets and trash cans full and then stuff just littering the floor."}
{"text":"I really don't know what the other people's problems are in posting negative reviews. Bacon is NOT a bad place.   The food is above par. The burgers are very good. The Hot dogs are as well. They do deli sandwiches along with a Carolina fried bologna sandwich that is GREAT.  They do have daily drink specials. It's a good place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"The burgers are 50% bacon, how can that be wrong? I had the breakfast burger (basically add a fried egg) and the bacon chips. I thought the chips would be hot from the frier, but they were sadly not. I tried my friend's fries and they were very tasty. I would get them instead of the chips, which were okay. The 2/3 pound burger is quite filling and I was not able to finish eating it. It got messy around the half-eaten mark, but that is usually a sign of how good the burger is--as this one was. The tea is VERY sweet. The service was very friendly, but possibly a bit too chatty. Although, I prefer that to absent. The booths are a bit uncomfortable. They are just wood at a 90 degree angle. Unless you like that, I suggest a table. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"For the record, I like bacon, and I've always liked bacon, but I'll be the first to channel my inner-hipster and say that the whole bacon craze trend is a little out of hands these days.  I do believe it's a little overkill with what crazed bacon creations people try to one-up each other on the internet with, and at the current pace, like most things, the joke will be beaten into the ground and pigs will go extinct from over-bacon consumption.  Anyway, I randomly came across this place while cruising down Franklin Blvd, looking for anything interesting at all.  \"Bacon, Inc.\" seemed pretty interesting enough, and I coerced my friends into joining me into this adventurous visit.  Location-wise, it's hard for me to say not being a local, but considering Franklin seems to be a major vein in the Gastonia area, I'd say that it's probably a fairly adequate one.  Maybe not as effective if it were lumped into the plazas with the more notable franchises, but at least the facade of its complex looks nice and more modern than the others.  There's plenty of free parking, which is obviously important.  Upon entering, I got the impression that the place was still kind of new-ish and getting its bearings; the vinyl sign hanging outside and the unlaminated paper menus also lead to that assessment as well.  Either way, the place isn't that large, but has a pretty good sized bar, as well as several booths and a few tables.  Plenty of televisions, and probably a great place to watch mainstream sports.  It's kind of bare-bones at the moment, but I get the impression that they're still a work-in-progress as well, so I'm optimistic.  The staff was attentive and quick to seat my friends and I, and was very informative of drink options and answer our questions about their bacon-centric menu.  The beer options left a little to be desired, being primarily domestics, as well as the el cheapo Natty Lights, but this is obviously not an issue if you're not a drinker.  But the food is what we came for, and as alluded to, the menu is chocked full of bacon-infused items, from bacon-wrapped pickles, mushrooms, and bacon-incorporated into everything from fries, chips, wings, and just about any other popular bar food, but matched bacon.  I'm glad to see that they truly dedicated to the crusade to make everything unhealthier, albeit tastier, by adding bacon.  The burgers were the obvious highlight of the menu, and what ultimately my friends and I all got.  They're available in 1/3, 2/3 and full 1 pound iterations, and they boast being 50% beef and 50% bacon.  I ordered a 2/3 pounder since I'm a fatty, and it came with extra bacon on top of it.  Seriously, it's like this place was one of those mad scientist internet bacon-obsessed websites come to life.  When it came, it arrived looking fantastic, with melted cheese on top, with cleanly placed fixing on top.  The first bite was a great experience, as juice dripped from the other end of the burger; I had skepticism that due to porky bacon being incorporated into the beef, the beef portion of the burger could potentially be dry and tough, but that was not the case.  Nor was the case where it seemed like the bacon was just like puree'd and mixed with ground beef, you could actually see chunks of bacon within the burger patty.  And to top it all off, it tasted great.  I chose to not put any ketchup or condiments on it, and throughout the whole burger, it didn't really need it.  Prices are more than reasonable, and some people will hate me if it comes to fruition, but I'd imagine they could charge more and get away with it, for having a fairly unique item.  Considering the fact that this place is putting all their chips into the current bacon craze, I have to imagine that there's always the possibility that this place could be an unfortunate casualty of the passing of trends.  I admire their mission of going in a unique direction, and I'd definitely come back if I lived in Gastonia or nearby, but it's completely up to the locals to support and sustain this truly interesting and quality restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place gives you explosive diarrhea and I'm glad I bought two ply toilet paper. It was simply bacon wrapped fast food that i don't think my dog would have been able to stomach. The waitresses made me glad I graduated high school- it took two of them to get a glass of tap water. This place works better than all the laxatives in my medicine cabinet combined. No wonder it is also a bar- I think the only way you could stand the food would be if you were severely intoxicated. Save your money and eat the remaining scraps stuck to your garbage disposal because that would be better than the meal I ate here. To the management: get your stuff together, your place sucks.   On a positive note, if you want a good burger with bacon go check out Bad Daddy over in Charlotte. Their Bad Ass burger is incredible, and not the McDonald's Reject burger at Bacon Inc."}
{"text":"There was little to no a/c on a week that averaged 96 degrees in June.  There was no hostess to greet at the front door.  The food took a really long time (30 min.) given we only ordered beef burgers and grill chicken sandwich. The potato salad was over loaded with mayonnaise.  Fast food places definitely had better selection and better burgers.  This place should just serve beers with chips and peanuts.  They cannot cook!  Don't waste your money !"}
{"text":"2nd time here hamburgers are great I tried the grilled chicken sandwich today I a big portion but had no flavor.  Staff is nice but slow and the food took forever to come out both times I was here"}
