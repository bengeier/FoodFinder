{"text":"Best Tamales in town and they even offer vegan options. Great friendly service! Check them out if you haven't done so yet."}
{"text":"The absolute best tamales I've ever had in my life. My wife and I get them every single farmer's market in Inspirada. The only bad thing is they don't have a restaurant I can go to more often! Arturo is also a very friendly person who sells the tamales."}
