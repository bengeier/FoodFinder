{"text":"Came here at 11pm because we were curious about this fairly new restaurant located in an area where we usually run our errands. For a first impression, I thought it was a club because of the music that they were playing. I thought it was going to be a relaxing bar. When we entered, the atmosphere in terms of aesthetics seemed to point at a relaxing, chill vibe but the music ruins it. How it's presented screams ambient music but they play really loud club music which is really unappealing since I really wasn't trying to party and the other customers didn't look like they were either.

In terms of food, they were not terrible. Some are fairly pricey and not very unique because I swear they used the same flavour and spices for every dish (if you've tasted those BBQ skewers from ayce Japanese restaurants, the bbq dishes are flavoured that way). We ordered spicy clams, enoki mushrooms, BBQ beef, BBQ squid, BBQ mackerel and a bowl of rice. They forgot the rice twice as in the original server didn't remember and the next one we reminded forgot or probably just didn't care because there were barely any customers. My favourite was the squid. I think it's my favourite BBQ squid so far.

We could've gotten congee or pizza from the spot next door and been more satisfied. Everything about this restaurant confused me."}
{"text":"Thought we'd check out this place for dinner after walking by previously and heard it's a restaurant with live music and a bar. This used to be a Rogers Video way back in the day. It's traditional food from China with dumplings, skewers, DIY noodle bowls, diff meats and vegetables etc. The Lamb and beef skewers(4 each) were amazing, the pork and cabbage dumplings(15) were good, but the sweet and sour soup didn't taste good at all and it came in a huge pot. Was too much for two people to finish. Live music was a nice touch to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food good. Nice atmosphere. Good place to chill. Dumpling are good price. The rest of the menu bit price. Music not to loud"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! The interior is modern and huge, very nice atmosphere compared to other similar joints. We got some skewers, dumplings, pancake and the laksa noodles. The dish that surprised me the most were the dumplings, the skin was sooooo smooth and soft, I've never had such a smooth dumpling. The pot stickers were HUGE, like size of 2 dumplings. Skewers were great as well! The laksa for me was so so, way too salty. Overall, nice addition to the mall and I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Interesting music bar and restaurant.  Service is top notch, waiter and waitress are very tentative.

Good is serve quickly with cute decor.

Great place to hang out with friends, listen to the performers ( piano n singing) 

Have a beer and relax"}
{"text":"Increasing to 4 stars for dinner dining. In terms of service, ambiance, and the live singing (wish the singer can sing Cantonese songs and more slow songs. Then it was like clubbing music which I didn't really like! 

Definitely a good place to overcome severe boredom when it's rainy and gloomy on an April day. The ??? is actually pretty good, comparable to restaurant that specializes in dumplings. The wrapping is thin and juicy. 

Skewer Fish is good, the beef skewer and squid, I find it a little cold. Overall, a great hangout place. Falling in love with this place!"}
{"text":"Very detailed interior. One side has music, where as the other side is . The music side is quite loud - hard to have a conversation, but the natural lighting during dinner is better. 

The service wasn't that great for dinner service, as it wasn't very attentive. I guess it was more suitable for the bar service - very lax. For dishes that needed a spoon, it wasn't given without being asked. 

They have a bit of everything. I can see the allure. From duck to skewers, to noodles and XLB - it's a huge mix. Drinks too - milk tea, smoothies, wine, beer and fruit sodas! 

The skewers were pretty good - we had the lamb and chicken cartilage. Oddly though, it was placed on a skillet that was supposed to be warmed by two candles - it was more for show. 

The dumplings and XLB were great too! The fried sweet potatoes was very sweet. I think sugar was added on top.

However, the others weren't that special. I wasn't the one that ordered, so I don't know the exact names! (Sorry!) 

The fish dish was fairly skimpy on the dish compared to other places I've had it - as well as for the price point.

The pig intestine smelled really bad - like BO. Normally it doesn't smell as strongly, so we didn't finish it. I would love some insight on this. 

I can see it being a great place for some music, drinks and skewers, but for dinner again, I'd pass."}
{"text":"Hutaoli is a popular restaurant chain in China with Southern and Northern regional cuisine. The restaurant is clean and modern in decor. We were seated in the \"lunchtime\" section of the restaurant accessible via the inside of Bridlewood Mall. There were small booths as well as long bench tables with padded stools that lack back support but at least have hooks underneath for bags/purses. The washrooms are clean and consist of single stalls. 

The larger east facing section of the restaurant is apparently only open during dinner hours but has private rooms for small groups. The dinner menu is a larger more comprehensive menu as compared with the lunch menu, which focuses on noodle soups, meat and vegetable skewers and dumplings.

Hubby and I shared a DIY soup which comes with napa cabbage, corn, and radish already present in a clear pork broth. You have the option of adding 5 toppings, and we selected shrimp balls, sliced beef tongue, a double portion of beef, enoki mushrooms. 
The broth was comforting and hit the spot on an icy cold day! The noodles could have been a bit chewier in my opinion but that's a personal preference.

We also ordered the coriander mushroom bean curd skewer which was a miss for me as the bean curd  was hard and chewy. The beef skewer was tender and seasoned with cumin. I like that they provide a mini food warmer with tea lights for fried or grilled food.

The dumplings are made in house. We got the steamed pork and Chinese cabbage dumplings (came with 15 dumplings) and I was pleasantly surprised that each dumpling was juicy and had a bit of soup base in it.

Several of the staff only spoke Mandarin which made it a bit challenging to decipher who's soup was being delivered to which person. Look for Joseph if you're not Mandarin speaking as he was very helpful. Will definitely return as my in laws want to try the dinner menu! 3.5 stars."}

{"text":"The place is quite new at the time of this visit, maybe about one month since it was opened. Very good atmosphere. The decor is unique. We came late around 9:30 pm and the place was full. Luckily a table cleared and we were seated right away.

The food selection was good, quite a different varieties was offered. The barbecued skewers are recommended. You can choose different kind of meat. We ordered beef and lamb. Very tasty and delicious. We also ordered some dumplings and barbecued chicken. Very tasty and crispy.

The live music was a bonus. The big screen was amazing, but when we were there it only showed background scenes because it was behind the live music. Price wise it's kind of pricey, but we enjoyed the visit."}
{"text":"A really different concept and BBQ skewers are really good.  You can see them making it in the Bbq grill.  The chicken wings, sausages, and the pork belly skewers are really good.  The skewers are cheap.  It's $6 for 4 skewers
They also make their own dumplings.  The pork and vegetables are really tasty and a must try.  
They have a large screen TV for karaoke.  I was told people book that whole area at night.  They said they will have a live band on weekends.  
The noodles are individual person in a small pot and the lobster noodles one is good.  You also get to choose 3 items on top.  
Give it a try.  The food is good and the place is comfortable.  Good concept."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars IMO. Came here for lunch around 1-1:30pm. They serve noodles during lunch so I ordered the rice noodles ($11.5), the option with the beef. You can choose 3 add-ons, I got the quail eggs, lettuce and beef. I believe it's a pork bone soup base, it comes with like 2 pieces of carrot, radish, some cilantro and a piece of corn as well. Portions are pretty large for one person. I also had the xiao long bao ($7). Flavour was decent and there was soup in the dumplings but the meat was kind of dry. I would come back but not often since it is kind of pricey here. Also they could've done a better job with the chairs or have a place for customers to hang their coats. Depending on where you're seated there isn't any room for that. Service is okay, they have like 5 servers so they are overemployed lol."}
{"text":"Short review here. Waiting staff were great. Beautiful decor and talented live musician. Food tasted wonderful too but... Everyone at our table of five was sick after. Sorry to say."}
{"text":"So glad this place is open till late night. Lovely food. Excellent service. Amazing ambiance. Perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"This place doesn't get the acknowledgement it deserves. Hutaoli has a special ambience, everyday there's a different singer that sings on stage everyday and after 11 pm they start playing house music, so that everyone can enjoy the snacks they offer while people enjoy a couple of drinks and relax. They offer a lounge for people to drink and on the other side it's a noodle bar for people that strictly are there for dining purposes. It's a very opened space so it's not too noisy in there even though it gets busy. 

The food started off as being mediocre when they first opened but after every visit I found that they're working on improving each and every dish that they offer on the menu. Everytime I go back the food only gets better. The staff are very attentive but make sure you check your bill in case. There's always room for improvement but I'm happy I finally found a new place where I can relax and have a couple of drinks with some friends, with some amazing bar food! 


Excited for my next visit ! 

There's a 3% fee for anyone who's paying debit or credit. 

Definitely worth trying !"}
{"text":"I doubt I'll give this place another visit. 

Pros: attitude of server is alright.  Decor is pretty good.  Atmosphere is alright

Cons: the server needs more training, water cup was pretty dirty.  The cups keeps falling over too when they put it on our table.  

There is a karaoke available for customers, but reality is they only let people they know personally to use it.  At first the server said we can use it as long as we ask.  Then they flat out said no when we actually asked.

They accept Visa, but you will have to pay the 3% transaction fee that they are not willing to pay.  Which makes this place \"cash only\".  Seriously don't accept it at all if you are going to be a cheap businessman.  You overprice your food and drinks anyways.  Greedy pos."}
{"text":"I ordered Xiao Long Bao, some skewers, grilled oysters and  Mala hot pot.
Xiao Long Bao is very juicy.
The skewers are pretty good- not too dry, the grilled oyster wasn't grilled but steamed and I don't like they put bell pepper on it.
The mala hot pot was too salty and I find they use the same sauce for the skewers and the oyster, so that makes it taste boring...."}
{"text":"I was actually here a little over a month ago for lunch. Since I can't give it zero stars, the one star is just for the decor.

Tables were not clean, and plates not set. We sat down for at least 10 minutes without tea, and then when we asked for our plate settings, the waitress gave me dirty chopsticks.

There was even a Caucasian family that came in, sat in a table near us and looked at the menu and said no thanks. I saw them at Mr Congee when I left the mall. 

However, food was so-so. Just ordered two plates of dumplings and I wasn't too impressed with them.

I wouldn't recommend or come back here at all."}
