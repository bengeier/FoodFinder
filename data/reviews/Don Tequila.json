{"text":"First time here and it was very busy but staff was great.  Chips and salsa of course to start were very good with different versions of salsa.  Food was auick and very good!! Im not a big mexican foodie but I could not find anything wrong with this place :-)"}
{"text":"Dear Mr Tequila,
Please improve your margaritas. Seriously. What's Mexican food without them??"}
{"text":"We always have a great experience here.  Margaritas are delish.  My favorites are the paradilla and the tacos pastor"}
{"text":"We've eaten here 2-3 times a month for the last few years. It's my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. I've never had a meal I didn't like! The menu is so huge and full of options, even your pickiest eaters should be able to find something they can enjoy.

I love how quickly the meals come out, which is especially nice when you're on your lunch hour. The portions are always great, and the staff treats us like family each time we stop in!"}
{"text":"Authentic. Delicious chips and salsa follow you to the table on arrival - food arrives on plates too hot to touch. We lived in the South West for 9 years and ate at many Mexican places ONCE, before calling DonnyTs our favorite. We have been enjoying perfect food here for 6 plus years. Very little turn over in wait or kitchen staff... consistent quality food and service."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed with the previous reviews in the area of customer service because honestly there was none. We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed  inconvenienced by us being there. After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer. We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job? They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive. If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd."}
{"text":"Maybe let's work on the chili rolenos. Do nice large poblemo peppers like el rancho and you got me as a frequent customer. A+ on the guacamole! Large portion. Nice!"}
{"text":"My veggie fajitas had a few little chicken pieces in it. I nearly vomited. I have not had meat in 5 years, so I was pretty disappointed. Probably will not be back. Good fresh guac though."}
{"text":"We've been going here several times a month ever since they opened. Some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever had at absolutely the LOWEST prices I have ever found for food this good. Waiters friendly and attentive. Nice decor. Nice new Bar."}
{"text":"Food is usually good and reasonable prices but the people who answer the phone can never ever ever get our order right,NO BEANS means exactly what it says.I had enough of the nonsense"}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is texmex and very good. I wish they offered black beans, I'm from California where black beans are popular. Margaritas are great, I got a buzz from two. The place was busy. Mexican families were here  and that's a plus."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the bright fun Mexican decor!  The food was delicious and reasonably priced!  And the margaritas were delicious!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. I found a use ketchup package in our chips. I told the waitress no apology No nothing. I marked the basket with a crayon. She end up bringing me the same basket. I'm pretty sure she just took out the ketchup package and returned my chips with the in basket. Seems like they recycle chips. How else can the ketchup get in the basket. Haven't been back since. I heard other story's but this is just what happened to me. Check please"}
{"text":"We had a really good meal here, service was quick and accurate.  Food was definitely better than most Mexican places around.  Margaritas were very good.  Most of all, the place was very clean!  Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"With everywhere else packed on a Friday night, we wondered in, not expecting much quite honestly. 

We both ordered off the specials menu, and my husband barely managed to squeeze in his standard 'where's my burrito' before two large plates, overflowing with food, arrived in front of us.

The food itself was good. Mexican food can too easily be greasy, but this was not. The menu is nothing startling, but the classic mexican dishes were all on the mark. And there was enough left over for a second meal tomorrow.

Prices were very reasonable - our total bill, including tips, was less than $25.  Definitely planning another visit."}
{"text":"Really good and fast service! Great tacos for 99 cents on Tuesdays! Only downfall is that it is beef and hard tacos only, but great service and food! It is also very clean and they have a very friendly staff. They have a happy hour selection Monday-Thursday for 50 cents off beers and 1 dollar off margaritas."}
{"text":"We go here with friends at least once a month, usually like food and prices; today got a bad waiter; I got  the wrong lunch and the four $6.50 lunches were billed at $8.99each, then he took my friends plate before he was done; still like the place, hope for a better honest waiter, from other comments, you need to watch bill."}
{"text":"I've tried lots if different items on the menu and all have been served hot and delicious.  Be aware from the time you order till the time your food arrives is about 5 minutes so if your looking to enjoy a pitcher of Texas Margaritas (the best) you might want to wait to put in your order in. The food and service is always consistently good. In my experience most mexican resturants are similar as far as the food but Don's in Amherst has the best employees who always make you feel comfortable."}
{"text":"This place has been good to me for many years. Food is nothing to gush about but it very nice for the price and time. Salsa is suprisingly good. Would highly recommend as a consistently pleasant place to eat."}
{"text":"If you have a hankering for Mexican, head on over to don tequilas. Fast service and delicious food with generous portions. We ordered the Guadalajara special tamale and the pollo adobe and they were both delicious."}
{"text":"Just went there yesterday, it opened a few weeks ago and now they have their alcohol license  The food and service were very good.  The restaurant was very clean and well kept.  I would go back again.  This Don Tequila is a different management from the Don Tequila that closed in Willoughby across from the hospital."}
{"text":"We previously had a bad experience here a while back. Since Chipotle had a line all the way outside we decided to go across the street and give them another try. It was early afternoon and really not that busy. The service was okay with the server checking up on us about every 20 minutes. It took 15 minutes to get our food. We had no problems getting refills on the chips, salsa and drinks. The fajitas were good. This is the only place I found broccoli in the fajitas. We also had chicken nachos and a spinach quesadilla which were generously proportioned. This visit was definitely a lot better than our last one. It was an average Mexican restaurant experience with average menu prices."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, large portions, fast, friendly service. What more can you ask for. We highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences ever. Food is not authentic or fresh at all. What we were served was soggy, mushy microwaved assembly line food. Red flags went up when our food came out after five minutes of ordering. Not to mention the sewer fly that kept landing on my food. 

The service was unfriendly to say the least. Half way through our meal we were ready to leave. After paying our bill the clerk told me he couldn't give me a receipt. It literally took three different people and a argument in front of other customers to finally get a receipt. 

I have gotten much better service and food at Taco Bell. I would highly not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We've eaten here about 8 times since they've opened. The staff always treats us like rock stars cause they know us from their Mentor restaurant. I have to say the food is ALWAYS fresh, tasty, and hot. This chain of Mexican restaurants is the best around. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant. I've been coming here since they opened in 2002 (I think). I can't say enough good things about this place. The food is always hot and fresh. You can eat all the chips and salsa you want, and they make it all fresh daily. The staff is super friendly and attentive. I eat here almost once a week so that tells you how much I enjoy this restaurant. I would estimate that I've eaten here more than 450 times over the past 14 years and I've never had a bad meal. So I guess I'm a big fan and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love coming here food is great always have Carlos wait on me he is a sweetheart . Nice and clean a++++++"}
{"text":"Wonderful steak and seafood dishes.  I love the Carne Asada and Lobster Bisque!  Servers are very good, but don't speak fluent English.  Atmosphere is cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly authentic Mexican food. Were always served quickly and the food is hot and fresh. 

My only complaint is what you get isn't necessarily what's described in the menu. Items often have missing or extra ingredients."}
{"text":"Inconsistent service, average food.....I've had better at Chipotle.....

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times since my first less than stellar review. I'm not sure if they've gotten better or that I just ordered the one bad thing on the menu the first time but this is our go-to Mexican restaurant now. Love the chopotle burrito!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible, should of went to Chipotle, 30 min for a appetizers, 45 for a burrito that was just steak in a wrap with cheese poured on it."}
{"text":"The service was ok, the salsa flavorful, and the food pretty good. They only serve pre mixed margaritas,  which is no bueno. I ordered the burrito fajita and it was great, but the kids nachos were bland and rubbery."}
{"text":"So, I thought the food was average. But what makes this place is the cool interior and super attentive and friendly bartenders and servers.  We felt like we were part of la familia. I haven't felt that way in a Mexican restaurant, probably ever.  Fajitas did not arrive sizzling. Bummer.  My bean burrito and cheese enchilada were standard fare. Nothing to shout about. The beer was extra cold so bueno for that.  Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  The red sauce was just like Old El Paso from the can. The tortilla chips were greasy.  The service was very good and quite fast.  The prices are very reasonable.  But the whole experience was un-memorable.  I shall not return."}
{"text":"Very tasty food I look forward to returning. The help is pleasant and polite while providing you with assistance in ordering and quickly supplying you with wonderful salsa and great chips. 
I love tamales and they are some of the best   This is a little known Mexican restaurant and I have mixed emotions.  I hope they stay busy but don't want it to become difficult for me to get their wonderful food. We really enjoy the whole menu and will keep returning"}
{"text":"Good tasting food. Portion sizes are good. Salsa is very fresh. Staff really hustles. Two times we've been there we had no wait for seating and that included on Cinco de Mayo. They have an outside patio."}
{"text":"Ruined my Birthday dinner.  Food was terrible. Waiter impatient.    When I told Manager I would not be returning he said fine.  Going to Taco Bell on my way home."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get Mexican food. The servers are always welcoming and friendly. The food is always great. I particularly enjoy the Durango Burrito and the Chicken Fajitas."}
{"text":"Very bland. Salsa is like tomato sauce. Enchilada sauce taste like canned marinara.. just awful."}
{"text":"Tacos al pastor--delish! Salsa and guacamole was very fresh! Refried beans were super good. Service was friendly and fast. Beer was cold and the bathroom was clean. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Amazingly good Mexican food but they rip you off EVERY time.  They scratch your order on a piece of paper with no descriptions and prices never add up. Its ALWAYS more. We have checked this several tines and wrote down everything we ordered and the prices on the menu and its been 20-30% higher consistently every time.  Its too bad they scam their customers like this because the food really is awesome.  Write down everything you order and be prepared to question your bill."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  The guacamole is a must have.  They make it right in front of you, and the taste is the best I have had."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the food has been consistently good. Their queso is hands down the best queso I've ever had! The salsa is also great. My favorite dish is the Shrimp Quesadilla."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and most of the staff are from Guadalajara.... Food is definately \"americanized\" and by that i mean tamed down in heat and changed a little for what americans expect.... But when i order my racos de carne asada with lime and cilantro and onions.... All i get are big smiles and HOT sauce.... So if your in the mood for authentic hotmexican food.... Just let the waiter know.. Hell guide you to a great choice!"}
{"text":"I had Jalisco special burrito plate. It was so good. A bit spicy but I like spicy. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"i don't understand all of the high marks for the this place. the chips were not good and the salsa wasn't good either.. the chips were bland, old and not seasoned at all, the salsa represented canned tomato taste, yuk, the chix enchilada was flavorless, while using white meat chicken it was not seasoned and very chewy, it had no flavor whatsoever and was definitely something \"not\" to order. the  most off putting thing about the place is the filthiness of all the furniture and the fact that we had fruit flies buzzing our table thru out our meal. while el rodeo and el patron are nearby, and have far better food,i cant understand what the attraction is to this place, will not be back"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. 

So, went out here with my girlfriend since we wanted to try something new.  When we get there it is nighttime and not too busy, so it shouldn't be too bad. Unfortunately the servers are too busy checking their phones and talking to help us out, making us stand there for about 10 minutes waiting to be seated. 

When we do get seated, we do get our drinks and free chips and salsa (which to be honest tastes a bit watered down, but its free to w/e). When we are ready to order we need to ask about some basic ingredients since my girl is allergic to some foods, which would make her ill. When asked, the waiter shrugs his shoulders and has us ordering russian roulette style for her. (Which it is cool if you don't know, but not even offering to ask the kitchen it kind of a jerk move since she did end up getting sick off of the food later on.)

We get our food in a decent time, but the food was a bit bland, and the service after was a bit slow considering that the place was rather empty. ie. It took awhile to get refills and the bill after we were done. Though glancing over I could see the serving staff just gathering in the area by the door checking their phones and showing each other stuff off of their phones. 

Now it is time to pay and we go up and wait by the register. We ended up having to wait another 10 plus minutes because the girl by the door was too busy on her phone to ring us up and instead called over our server to do it. 

Would not go to this place again and whoever manages it, this place is a joke and needs some people who are willing to work or at least put some effort into making it a decent dining experience."}
{"text":"Passed this place a few times and finally decided to try it. I got the #17 on the lunch menu. It was a burrito  with eggs, chorizo and cheese.  It was probably one of the most tasteless burritos I've ever had. It was covered in what appeared to be some sort of franks red hot sauce, and no im not mistaking it for enchilada sauce. The side of my plate was a pile of tomatoes shredded cheese and a piece of lettuce, a whole piece not shredded. Not happy with my lunch at all. The salsa and cheese dip were average, nothing to go crazy over. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which kinda scared me. I like quick service, but also don't mind waiting a few minutes for some really good food. Overall the place was cute, people were friendly but food was less than OK. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"They always have great margarita and beer specials. They could use a wine update.  There food is always fast and quick.   I have seen the kitchen it's pretty clean.  The food is above a 3.  They just introduced a homemade gauc.  This was pretty good too. I normally get spicy salsa mixed with regular.  They have nice patio small bar.  The worse part it's in front of trailer park.  All and all good"}
{"text":"Went on a saturday night on the first night of summer, and had a party of 12.   We were sat almost immediately.  Went there because they had catered a party of a friend of mine.

Our server was professional, and bilingual.  But you could totally understand him and had a cool accent.  Americanized i suppose.  They do not use a POS system but use an old paper check system...so separate checks becomes an issue.

They put tons of chips and salsa in front of you...the chips are super crunch but almost no salt, and the salsa was bland for my taste.

I had the el paso speciai; beef tip burrito and chicken burrito w/ rice and beans.  All came out hot but a little watery.  Dunno where that came from.  But I did ask for lettuce/tomato set as it did not come with any in or on it.

Kids food came out fast, they did have the world cup and that seemed to distract the waiters...but as far as Mexican food goes it was pretty good for Mentor."}
{"text":"I love it here but seriously dont be skimpin my rice fr tho we all love rice also dont be skimpin the queso los toros has two sizes!!"}
{"text":"Went on the fajita 2 for 1 special night, and the portion size of meat was the same if not smaller than the single portion. The waiter said... \"Hey, it is the special ya know\" when I asked why it was so small. They didn't offer to add anymore to it. The meat was also very small pieces. This place received 2 stars, because at least the salsa was pretty good. Probably will not return here. The other locations are much better, and better value."}
{"text":"This is our go to Mexican restaurant. The staff is kind and courteous and Javier is an amazing gentleman. Always prompt , fresh and delicious. Their mango margaritas and dos Equis pair perfectly with our meals. Very family friendly and great atmosphere. Really a great place"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Kirtland, OH.

Decided to try even though the outside appearance was somewhat questionable.

But nice simple decor inside.  Friendly waitress who gave good tips from the menu.

We both had the Tres Amigos.  Nice chicken, steak, shrimp combo."}
{"text":"First time I eat here I came with friends who told me the food was the most authentic Mexican food they ever had, well it was not for me since it's not really Mexican but Tex Mex really. It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about either, I ordered a piña colada and the waiter spill it over me without replacing it not good at all, the place tries so hard to be unique and as Mexican as can be but it is just a caricature and a stereotype of anything Mexican honestly I was waiting for the three amigos to come out of the bathroom or something I despise decoration like this  and it affected the overall rating. Second time there food was not as good I ordered a dish that included carnitas in it but they were missing I told my waiter he apologized brought them in told me he was sorry but he charged me for them anyways even though they were supposed to be included. Not as bad as others but not great by any means."}
{"text":"Great service,  food and pricing. Had lunch and everything was excellent. Will definitely be a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"Great food each time I've gone. However, we had horrible service tonight. Seemed to be a newer waiter. Hopefully this was a one time thing. Floor was very slippery and unswept too. I'll be back again. Hopefully next time will be better"}
{"text":"Sometimes you need a little spice in your life. Don Tequilla delivers. The neon sign beckons you inside and once there, sit back and enjoy.

The roomy booths offer space for cozy dinner or enough room for your whole brood or gang of friends. Nibble some fresh chips and salsa while you ponder your meal options. The salsa is fresh with tomatoes, cilantro and spice. In case that isn't enough heat for you ask for the special sauce from the kitchen for extra kick and spice.

I ordered the chili rellenos hoping not to be disappointed - this gal spent some time in Arizona and loves her Mexican food. These didn't disappoint. Yum. Served with rice and beans with a drizzle of red sauce.

Good enough to want to return and sample through the menu -- several other items caught my eye - fish tacos, nightly specials, burritos with tomatillo sauce!!! 

The staff is friendly and patiently gives you time to check-out the menu and answer any questions. nom.nom."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a Sunday.  Arrived around 12:30, and there were a decent number of customers seated.

Service was friendly and fast, food was excellent, and they have DRAFT BEER, including a couple of Mexican brews.

This location is the best Don Tequila I have been to."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  The most amazing Mexican food I have ever tasted and I am a foodie. My husband and I ordered the table side guac.  Delicious!   Texas margaritas. Delicious!  Seafood burritos with fresh cilantro!  I will be salivating for them soon!  All of the food was so fresh!  You must try this place. We will try the Green Road location next as it is closer to our home."}
{"text":"i love this place!

First impressions this place is a fun atmosphere filled with mexican clay rooftops and colorful furniture.  You get your chips and salsa as you sit down as usual while they take orders for drinks.  They got horchata here now, which is a + in my book, if you haven't tried it yet, i totally recommend to.  

The food came out rather fast and speedy on extremely hot plates.  The salsa and hot sauces there are bombbbbb. Ask them for homemade style hot sauces they make in the kitchen, it's different everytime you go in.  Some will leave you sweating and some will leave a sweet or an extra tomato flavor in your mouth.

The food i'd definitely rate 7.5/10. as i'm a hardcore mexican food lover.  It's nothing you find in texas or california, but quite damn close.  I always find myself coming back to this fun filled, warm, family owned place and always leave feeling satisfied.  for taqueria style tacos, try the tacos el pastor!"}
{"text":"Good tasting food, friendly service, reasonable prices, clean and inviting environment. What else do you need? Give it a shot, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best service (amalfi) good food and drinks love the service and enjoy everything here"}
{"text":"Walking into this place, I was greeted by a warm and colorful atmosphere. Came here on a date with my significant other and enjoyed a nice meal. Food was delicious, however, my waiter couldn't seem to speak the hell up. The Sprite was very refreshing as well."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and so far every time we've gone the foods been great, the service has always been friendly and the portions are amazing!"}
{"text":"Alrighty then, I had Don Tequila's delicious shrimp cocktail, as a meal. There was plenty of shrimp to make it a meal, a little pricey. My cousin had their lime Tilapia salad, which looked scrumptious & was thoroughly enjoyed! One day, these Mexican restaurants will learn how to serve \"frijoles de olla\", which are whole pinto beans that are boiled in seasoned water & are delicious.... this bean dish would go with rice soo much better than the \"creamy\" beans that most Mexican restaurants insist on serving! Ugh! Wake up Mexican restaurant owners!! #SatsfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"I had the burger and fries but it took a long time to come out and when it did THERE WAS A BITE TAKE OUT OF THE BOTTOM BUN so i had the make a new one and there was a lot of pink but the fries are decent"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I have been to which includes Nuevo Acapulco. However, I do get a little frustrated when I have a waiter who doesn't smile and seems too exhausted to be friendly.  I understand that because of the neighborhood,  tips may not be what they should BUT I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU IF YOU TAKE CARE OF ME!!!    SMILE!  WELCOME ME!!"}
{"text":"Food is always great especially Tableside Gauc but today service was really slow because of kitchen. Waiter couldn't have been nicer"}
{"text":"It had great food at a good price. Service was good as well. Id recommend it to anyone looking for good mexican style food."}
{"text":"If you blink. You will miss this little eatery, squished into the corner of a small strip mall in Mentor, Ohio.

I went with a friend of mine from the area, who was treated like a rock star when he arrived (well, he IS a rock star), and that's indicative of the casual and familial vibe at this restaurant.  I didn't take notes - too busy enjoying the company - but I'm pretty sure I got a burrito and it was delicious.  Margaritas were excellent (this much I do remember) and service was quick and pleasant.  Now that I know that this place exists, it gives me even more reason to travel to the northern tip of Ohio for good company and eats!"}
{"text":"Food was AWESOME. The normal tacos are ... well ... normal and typical. My wife ordered the chicken fajitas and they were very good fajitas. I ordered the burrito durango which was a 12 inch shell STUFFED with chicken, steak, and huge shrimp! I asked for it spicy... and it actually came with pretty good heat. The burrito was outstanding, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. Overall, we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I love Don Tequila's so much! I've been coming here since they had their old location on Cooper Foster at the old Taco Bell. They have great service, delicious food and good happy hour prices. I love ordering their chicken fajitas. they are sooo good. This place is authentic and it's the real deal. Their salsa is very yummy and homemade.

Every time I come here there is always a good crowd because the food is so good. I love their frozen margaritas and they're only $3.99 during happy hour which is 4-8pm. They are always consistent with a fun atmosphere. These people giving low stars don't know anything about authentic Mexican food. I lived in California for 7 years and Don Tequila's food is right there with the food in LA. 

You can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu. You will leave filling full and happy! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, Everytime I visit home I come here to get my Mexican kick.  The food is very authentic,  I enjoy the shrimp quesidilla......I try to make it at home since I live 1,000 miles away but not the same!  They have some sort of magical touch.  muy bueno!  

Magaritas and queso fundido   my two best friends!"}
{"text":"Food was ok , I've had better, the food was sorta bland and didn't have much taste. Salsa was ok. Our particular waiter wasn't very freindly and we didn't see much of him, he took our drink order then never returned, another waiter rushes over and says the first guy had to \"go make quacamole\"......oook. so the second guy took our drink order and delivered our drink along with two other people :/. Service was really slow over all."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time to celebrate my birthday.  We ate a ton of fresh chips in advance of the meal, the salsa was pretty mild.

I had the Chori pollo, which is a burrito with chorizo and chicken with rice.  Man, it was amazing. Hot and spicy with peppers, I took some of the huge portion home and ate it the next day.  

The service was seriously, amazingly fast for a group of 4, and they kept our drinks regularly filled."}
{"text":"We have just moved from Austin,TX to NE Ohio and are searching for our new favorite Mexican restaurant.  We were greeted promptly and brought to our table.  The chips were fresh and warm.  The salsa was a little blander than we care for.  Service seemed slow, but in all fairness it was Saturday evening.  I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas which had pieces of lobster sautéed with onion and tomato wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.  It was average.  My husband had the Burrito Especial with a chicken burrito and a beef tip burrito.  Hubby said it was above average.  The rice had a nice flavor with an aftertaste of tomato and cilantro.  We were disappointed with the lack of complex flavor profiles that we have become accustomed to while living in the Southwest.  Overall, we rated it as adequate to good."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 5 times now and each time is better than the last. I Iove what they have done to improve the building and add outdoor dining. Service is always good here and on par with other top places in Mentor. I really suggest the chicken soup on a cold day it's very yummy! Everything I've had on the menu has been great."}
{"text":"The food is good but all Mexican restaurants tastes the same to me.  The food comes out extremely quick which makes me wonder about the freshness."}
{"text":"Very good, reasonable priced . The Texas quesadilla with chicken, 
Steak, shrimp, onion, peppers and cheese was large and very good
They have Dos Equis on draft!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican place!! Very tasty and reasonably priced. We ordered Molacajete, seafood chimi and carne asada burrito. The best!! Molacajete is a must try! This is something new I have never tried before. Service is quick! Cute authentic decor."}
{"text":"Pretty typical Americanized Mexican fare, but solid.  I got the carnitas, and they were yummy fat filled goodness.  

Huge margaritas available, although I was excited to see pacifico on tap.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! I love this place! Come almost every Friday. Try the Chicken Chili Verde, my first favorite dish. My new favorite, Burrito Chipotle!!!! So delicious! Don't forget the margaritas!! :)"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed here was the decor, which I have to say I liked.  Of course, yes, I enjoy lime green walls and bright pink color washes, but that's just me.  

We had three little ones with us, so you can imagine that we were a little less than organized, but our server took it all in stride, which we appreciated.  He was also super fast; I think all of us were surprised how quickly our meals came out. 

As for the food, I feel like it's a little difficult to review.  I had never been here before and my Mexican palate is less-than-sophisticated, so I randomly ordered a plain enchilada and quesadilla.  The latter was pretty good, though I found the enchilada a little perplexing.  It was hiding under the sauce and I couldn't really tell what was in it.    

The chips and salsa were great, though.  And hot.  The one person at our table who can apparently drink tabasco sauce straight even admitted his eyes were watering a little.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals.  

I'm not in Ohio much, but I'd happily go back and try something else.  Oh, and um, I wouldn't exactly object to painting my living room lime green, after seeing how cool it looked at Don's."}
{"text":"Past by this restaurant many time. Decide to try it out. Amazing food. Good margarita and great friendly service. Tableside fresh guacamole can't get any fresher. The mojacajelta meat fajita is amazing. Meat are well seasoned. Best part is the roasted jalapeno. Definitely a hangout spot for us."}
{"text":"Go with the chicken and shrimp fajitas. The home made guacamole is really good too. Made right in front of you. Best mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"My family comes here all the time. It's a rare occasion when we miss \"Taco Tuesday\" at Dons. I can't go anywhere else for a margarita now. They are so good. I usually always get tacos, which are cooked to perfection and topped with crispy lettuce. This time we opted for fajitas, alas it was not Tuesday. Oh boy was I surprised! Unbelievably good."}
{"text":"Always the same old bad Mexican food. At least this time I did not get the nearly 2 foot piece of hair in my Fajita Burrito.
Why many people I know, including my wife like to go to this place is beyond me."}
{"text":"Last minute decision for four of us...we all had the special. We all enjoyed the steak burrito and had plenty for lunch tomorrow.
We also had a pitcher of excellent margaritas.
Michael, our server, made a tableside guacamole that was delicious.
Serve was quick..not pushy... a fun dinner with friends?"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Elyria location but I was meeting others, so we agreed on Amherst location. We went here on Monday. They weren't very busy but yet we were there forever. I asked for a highchair for my little guy, and they said ok but never brought the highchair back. I went to the front of the restaurant to look for the host or cashier to ask about the highchair but nobody was around! The other servers wouldn't even acknowledge me. I got the highchair myself & carried it back to my table, again nobody acknowledged me. It took quite awhile for our server to take our drink orders & bring us chips & salsa. The chips were stale. I was a little surprised because usually chips & salsa are one of the best parts of the Mexican restaurants. My server was nice & he got our orders all right, but we had to wait a long time for drink refills & even had to ask. The food itself wasn't very good. It wasn't horrible but just not very good. When I went to pay at the front of the restaurant, the cashier didn't greet me, he didn't ask how everything was, or anything! He honestly didn't say one word to me. He just had the attitude like I was bothering him & he didn't really care! I'll go to the Elyria location next time. Never again Amherst. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because my server was friendly & got the orders correct. It wasn't his fault the food wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Terrific service. The place was packed, but we were seated right away. Chips and salsa on the table as we were seated. Great food, big portions, fast service."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, but every time I come here with friends they overcharge us. We end up getting charged at least a few dollars more than our menu items should be when we check out, and it's happened on several different occasions. 

Though the food may have been good and reasonably priced (on the menu, not on the bill), we will unfortunately never be going back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This will probably be my last review of this location. I was at don tequila yesterday & the cashier was talking  to me but I couldn't understand so I laughed it off. 
    
He told me I looked sexy today and said something else. I said thanks and laughed so that he wouldn't be offended. He came around the counter and walked up on me then hugged me so I assume he was asking for a hug. 
    
He then whispered in my ear that he just wanted to feel my breast on his chest. Seriously....I don't feel like I need to wear jeans and sweaters in the summer because he is a pervert. 

It was very disrespectful and unprofessional and I feel uncomfortable eating there anymore."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my son and sister. We were seated immediately and offered drinks right away. I ordered a vodka and soda with 3 limes and got a tall with 3 lemons. Not a huge deal and it was corrected but it didn't taste good. Unsure if the limes weren't fresh or the club soda was off. 

At best I can describe their food as unremarkable. My sister ordered a chicken chimichanga, I ordered steak fajitas with the veggies well done, and my son ordered a combination platter, hold the chorizo . What my sister got was not a chimichanga but edible, my sons combo platter had chorizo, and my veggies were not well done. The platter wasn't Even sizzling for me to do it myself. 

Nothing was bad per se, just not \"OMG THIS IS DELICIOUS! I'm so glad we came here!\" We have since gone back again, hoping it was an off night the first time and it wasn't. The service is good, the food is eh. 

Boy do we miss Jaliscos."}
{"text":"Been dining here since it first opened. Wife is from tx so this is her taste of home. When tx folks come to visit they ask to go to Don's. 
It's very good tex-mex."}
{"text":"There are a few easy things every 'mexican' restaurant should be able to accomplish. One is to make your margarita mix fresh in house. The next is to use fresh ingredients not jar mushrooms in your mushroom quesadilla. Finally, guacamole is quite simple to make fresh. Not sure what the creamy watery mess was we received.  Two stars for the skinny marg."}
{"text":"Super friendly guys who run the place.  Wonderful and homey authentic Mexican food.  It's our go-to Mexican place."}
{"text":"Why hello service. Don't let the lime green walls scare you, this place is all business. Seated immediately, the waiter came to the table immediately, and the food came almost immediately after we'd ordered. Boyfriend got a combo platter with an enchilada and taquito and devoured the whole thing. I got a carnitas dinner platter and I could only finish half since I filled up on chips and salsa and guacamole. It was so good! 

The only disappointing part was the dessert. We ordered flan, and when it arrived it was covered in whipped cream and strawberry sauce which I am not a fan of. The consistency was nubbly. Should've went with the churros."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great and friendly service really treat you right food cooked to perfection every time I visit, margarita flavors are amazing and I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for authentic Mexican food. My server was so friendly and nice made me feel like I was dining at an actual friends home this place will really take care of you absolutely amazing all around I won't stop coming back and will be my first recommendation to all my friends and family see you again soon Dons!!"}
