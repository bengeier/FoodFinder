{"text":"I hope that I can give a Zero Star review... If I can't than consider my One star as both tax and tip. Long story short, this restaurant is a master of deception, one walks into the place and is greeted by an assortment, no a cornucopia, of fresh delicious fish. Then one is lead to a table which is far too cramped with very little atmosphere and no sound management.... Felt more like a cabane Ã  sucre than a pseudo high end resto without the inherent conviviality of the cabane. At our table, we had ordered some crab cakes and both items off the not so VIP section of the meal. The crab cakes were unassuming disks fried for far too long in oil far too cold and needing replacement. They tasted like pollock flavored saw dust. The seafood stew was not up to par... Way too much potato and cheese, to cover up the sad and sorry fact that they has used a baged frozen seafood mix. The fried fish platter was as saw dusty as the crab cakes. Also, the one thing that I wanted to eat, lobster, was written on a black board at the entrance in faded chalk of similar color to the background of the board.... No menu insert. So, to conclude, if you want to be wowed then lead to a feeding trougth like cattle... Go on ahead eat at Peters Feeding Station... Just don't expect quality food."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I grew up in Scotland, the undisputed champion of fish and chips. Actually Scotland tops the list for anything you could conceivably deep fry. Forget the famous deep fried Mars bar, that's a gimmick, but if you happen to be in the old country and you know you need a change from the fish suppers (Scottish for fish and chips) because having it for breakfast, lunch and dinner for a week has dampened your enthusiasm, I thoroughly recommend deep fried haggis or deep fried pizza. I kid you not.   To cut a long story short, Pete's fish and chips was the best I have had in 2 decades of living in North America. Shocking really. I mean, how difficult can it be.   It gets 4 stars for that reason. It would be 3 stars in Scotland. Just so you know."}
{"text":"Pete's Cape Cod is a very well known restaurant situated in the West Island, Sainte Anne de Bellevue to be more precise.  It's also a restaurant that I've been going to for the last ten years. Sadly as of today, it will be my last time I will be stepping in into the restaurant. Here's why...  The restaurant was sold to a new owner a few months ago. To which I can tell things are not the same and have deteriorated quite drastically. Both in quality of food, and service. Along with that, the prices have risen drastically. Low quality of food and high prices is a horrible combination!   Three of us have ordered a different dish. Everything consisted of seafood since that is the main focus of the restaurant. Nothing about our dishes tasted fresh!  We had; Grilled fresh tuna with fries, smelts alongside of fries as well. Lastly fish and chips.  In all of our three dishes, the fries were rubbery, lukewarm, and stale. To be honest, completely inedible! Which fries is the side dish of your main dish. So we were left with one thing to eat.  The platters are served usually with a lovely salad. Not anymore. This time we were served a tiny pile of tasteless iceberg lettuce, with one cucumber slice and a very sweet from a bottle dressing.   We kindly informed our waitress about our fries and how disappointed we are. Her only reply was \"I'm sorry!\" Which I thought it was a poor way of handling the situation.  As I mentioned before, we were three of us with no wine to drink. Simply water and a soft drink, along with a glass of beer. Our total for the lunch was a ridiculous overpriced lunch of $85.00  I always had a soft spot for Pete's Cape Cod. Unfortunately, I no longer do.  I would think twice, of going back. If I ever do."}
{"text":"I don't get the negative reviews for this place. I've always had a good meal here whether it was lobster rolls, seafood pasta, appetizers - all tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"While visiting my in laws we decided to meet friends at Peter's big mistake that day.  While the patio and al fresco dining is great the service that day was awful and my fish the Mahi Mahi was undercooked.  The waitress did not check on our table and waited 15 minutes until she brought the childrens meals.  Imagine 6 hungry children waiting that long for food.  She forgot our appetizers.  The manager was nice and comped my fish.  I though the other meals were good, the fried sole and fish nuggets for the kids.  I would not recommend this place unless it was a nice day and you only wanted a beer or wine outside which overlooks the river."}
{"text":"I love this place, whenever I'm in town I make sure I drop by Peter's Cape Cod. The price is right and the food is great. I love seafood and this place delivers what I crave. This is the place to be in the summer time, they have a nice terrace and great service. If you visit Sainte-Anne-De-Bellevue you have to visit Peter's Cape Cod. I recommend the shark steak, delectable!"}
{"text":"Such a nice place and they ruined it. I don't want to go specific, but staff trying really hard. However kitchen is terrible. Cheap food and no taste at all. I could not make a difference in the taste between Tilapia and Grouper. Both files were previously frozen and definitely were cooked on the microwave first. Baked potato was at least from yesterday. If you go there- summer only for beer and fries on the patio"}
{"text":"The place has been around for ages and has a good reputation among locals. I have been twice, though, and was underwhelmed both times. I found my meals fairly bland. The service was reasonable.  The best thing about the place is the location, on the water. If you sit indoors, the atmosphere is nice, with typical seafood theme."}
