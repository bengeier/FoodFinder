{"text":"Food was great and beer selection was alright. Great place to watch the Panthers game."}
{"text":"First time here and the good and service was great. Get the nachos and the avocado chicken sandwich. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Tuesday. First time there. 

First thoughts- The hostess stand/ entrance wasn't clear. We walked in through the outdoor seating and the hostess waved us over. I could see this being an issue if it's busier. 


The decor/atmosphere is relaxed and casual. 

The food. We ordered the Parmesan pretzels and avocado salsa. The pretzels were super salty. We had to scrape off all the salt/Parmesan to make them edible. The cheese dip was tasty but quickly became a solid because it wasn't quite hot enough. 
The avocado salsa was tasty but came with potato chips - some which were soggy. It made the salsa difficult to eat. 

For my main dish I got the whiskey chicken. The chicken had nice flavor. The dish came with potatoes and brussel sprouts. The potatoes were dry and brussel sprouts just tasted like they had been char grilled with no seasoning.

Overall it was okay. It wasn't bad. It wasn't wonderful.  The service was attentive. 

 I'll probably go back and give lunch a shot."}
{"text":"Walking distance from my apartment. Amazing beers on draft, also awesome food. I recommend getting the salmon burger, or the duck tacos. Service is always awesome when going, I've never had a problem when going there, will always return"}
{"text":"Beer braised pork shanks in cheer wine BBQ sauce - where have you been all my life?   Unbelievably good.  The pork is tender and juicy, literally falls off the bone.   The Korean BBQ lettuce wraps are also amazing.  I \"discovered\" these treats at a yelp part, so can't say much about the restaurant itself, but if everyone is as nice as the folks working the party then it must be an awesome place.  Awesome"}
{"text":"Very rude hostess called and could not get my question answered and made it seem like I was a bother. Usually enjoy this place but the young staff and their attitudes are slowly making this place less enjoyable. Also constantly changing their menu, make up your mind"}
{"text":"Went to watch a college football game. Sat at bar for really long time with promise they would put game on. Bartender said he would but never did. I asked for manager never came.  I went to the manager and she said sorry she won't put it on. Was not served again.  I was very polite but she did not care. We packer fans travel in huge bunches. I am sure all who see this review will avoid this unwelcoming place. BTW food sucked anyway"}
{"text":"If I could give u a 1/2 star I would. Not even done w wings and waitress who hadn't come through to check on us was quick to bring check. First time here, heard good reviews but doubt I'll return. 2 of my chicken wings were still red inside. Understand it's college football night but your workers need to be trained on customer service!"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT! I wish we lived closer so we could eat there on a regular basis.  The beer selection was on-point and the food was just great.  Portions were large, seafood was fresh, and service was top-notch.  The atmosphere is relaxed but pretty and the porch looked like a great place to spend an afternoon.  I definitely wouldn't skip this place on your next night out in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place. 5 stars in every way, food, beer and service. We had the Korean BBQ lettuce wraps, duck flatbread, and mushroom and goat cheese flatbread - all were phenomenal. The duck prepared on the flatbread was the best I've ever had. 
The menu is really creative with plenty of options. You can get adventurous and try something new or get a classic with a twist.

Our bartender Tara took great care of us, let us try a lot of the beers we had never seen before and was so nice to talk to.

If you haven't tried Draught (pronounced draft) you should try it while it's still a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I cannot give Draught enough stars. I am constantly blown away by their service & food (even on game days when it is shoulder to shoulder) they go above & beyond to take care of my husband & I. We are so lucky to live beside such an amazing restaurant & bar! Favorites on the menu: Nachos (best in Charlotte hands down) Pimento Cheese balls, tacos, and collards! Don't forget $5 Moscow mules on tuesday!"}
{"text":"Had the old bay wings were good, and the hand cut fries were great!!  Good selection of draft beers and great place for hanging out and having a few drinks"}
{"text":"The greatest Panther bar in Charlotte with the CANS:Recyled event for every game, home or away! Music, Bud Lite, great Panther fans, big screen TVs everywhere and 100 yards from Bank of America stadium so you can hear the Panther Fans ROAR! #keeppounding ! #panthernation !"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday brunch. Good food & great mimosa bar. Our waitress was very accommodating. I will def be back :-)"}
{"text":"Went here to watch the Mayweather fight. It was free entry to watch the fight. What a great way to market the business and get people in the door. Everyone else in town charged $20-50 to watch the fight. We lucked out visiting here. It was a great venue. Inside and outside tables/seating and over a dozen large TVs. The drinks were strong. We didn't order any food, but the nachos looked really good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good drinks, but mediocre food.  I had lunch here at 12:30 pm on a Monday.   The place was fairly empty, a few people sitting at the bar.  Lots of flat screen televisions, all set to sports channels.   We were seated promptly and the waitress was quick to refill our drinks.  

I had the short rib sandwich with fries, $12.   It normally comes with \"beer cheese,\" but I asked they leave it off.  I have no idea what beer cheese is - and neither did the waitress.  The bread was an oblong hoagie type loaf  with fatty square cuts of beef.  There was lots of meat, about the equivalent of two decks of cards.  The sandwich also had grilled onions.  The beef was very tender, but a bit tasteless.   The bread was worse.  I asked for some steak sauce and ate the beef with a fork and left the bread behind.  The fries were a bit soggy and they came with seasoned salt.  My friend had the meatloaf sandwich, $11.     The  waitress said it was a local favorite.   His bread looked to be of a much better quality than mine.  He said the meatloaf was good, but not great. 
  
If you are looking for craft beers (over 40) or an upscale bar to watch the game, this may be a good choice.  But eat lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"PASS!!! Not worth coming here for the food... Good place for a beer though! Too many places nearby that have good food and good beer. Average service."}
{"text":"I ordered a glass of water with my meal and after 1 sip I never touched it again - it tasted musty and mildewy.  Next I ordered the Cranberry Apple salad with the addition of grilled chicken for an upcharge.  My salad came but without the chicken.  The waitress admitted it was her fault but I had to wait 10 minutes while my boyfriend was already eating.  She also got his order wrong but he was too hungry.  She ignored me because I was going to tell her to forget the chicken but she wouldn't even look at me.  Finally a nice young man brought it from the kitchen.  She seamed irritated we were paying with a Living Social voucher and after the payment she mumbled something as she walked away and never returned again even though we stayed watching a ball game and finishing our drinks.  Seating is rather limited indoors and extremely loud, not sure I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot! Plenty of seating, TVs, beer selections, foods. Only one stall for the bathroom, but clean. The staff are all very friendly, competent and knowledgable about their menus. 
I started with the special Moscow Mule and a Franzikaner (weissbeer), both super yummy!
We had a party of 10 and split: duck tacos (Oh My God!!!!), pretzels w beer cheese (sinfully delicious carbs!), nachos (instead of tortilla chips they were rippled potato chips - nice twist n yummy), two flatbreads - goat cheese apple and something else (nothing spectacular but good), and pimento fritters (heavenly, the red pepper honey dip isn't even necessary). 1 waitress handled our party with zero issues, including when we split up the bill funky. She definitely deserved her tip and helped us rush out to make our movie time. 
I will absolutely go back! Can't wait for warmer weather to enjoy their nice patio too."}
{"text":"I work about a mile from here and have driven by many times but decided to stop in for lunch today.  

I checked in using the Yelp app and there was a deal for 20% off the meal.  When I presented it to the waiter he said he was sure they had stopped honoring that deal but he gave it to us anyway, which was great.  Thanks Ryan!  I liked the atmosphere of the place, small but not crowded feeling.  Very industrial decor & the hardwoods & wood tables look great.  I wish I hadn't been on a work lunch because they have a great beer selection! 

Being it was mine & my coworkers first time here, the waiter (Ryan) was great at suggesting items from the menu.  We ordered the fried pimento cheese fritters for an app...oh so amazing!  I got the fried green tomato blt and my coworker ordered the steak sandwich.  Both items were great! 

We will definitely be back and have other coworkers in tow.  I've also heard great things about their Sunday brunch, hopefully I can check that out someday."}
{"text":"Food was clearly made with fresh, high quality ingredients. Outstanding items were the house chips and side item collard greens which must have been marinated in pork for a long time since they were so delicious. The meatloaf and duck special were very good and we would order again but looking forward to trying other items."}
{"text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was at this sports bar. The mushroom gravy on the bacon wrapped meatloaf was out of this world. Meatloaf was good, but that gravy was amazing. The collards and potatoes were top notch. Flavors perfectly balanced."}
{"text":"Good lunch but not spectacular. Service was ok but not great. We shared the pimento cheese balls as an appetizer and they were good although not piping hot in the center like you would expect. Def didn't stop us from chowing down on them!! Then I had the mahi mahi tacos which were delicious! It comes as 3 tacos which was enough for me but would be nice if they came with a side or something as it isn't a ton of food if you were hungry!!"}
{"text":"Great place great atmosphere and aesthetics. Bartenders are speedy and there's a good energy. But I wish they wouldn't have taken the duck pot pie off the menu!! It was the best thing I ever ate and one of the main reasons I kept coming back. I'll be back still but will really miss that dish. Bring it back!"}
{"text":"The uber driver dropped us off and when we got there they were closed to the public for a party. There was hardly anyone in there. While we waited on another Uber ride, we asked if we could get a drink. They were very rude! We are here twice a year for business and like to come here, but after that, it will be our last time!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, love the mimosa bar and music. Customer service was great and food over all was yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday night.   Positives are friendly staff, outdoor seating,  extensive beer selection, and decent food (had pulled pork flatbread and wings).  The negative is that the service was extremely slow/ disorganized.  I've never been here before so I am not sure if it is always like that.  But the food, beer and friendly service outweigh that.  I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bulgogi Lettuce Wraps and Short Rib Mac n Cheese. There was more lettuce than anything else in the wraps and the Mac n Cheese had two little dry pieces of @short rib\" and service was a bit on the slow side. Not likely to go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The good: Nice city view from the deck, outdoor seating.  $5 Tito's Mules on Tuesdays.  Very close to the Panthers stadium.  There are TVs and a decent draft selection.  The food was OK.

The bad:  The food was just OK.  The hostess seemed bothered that we wanted to sit at the last table outside and it would need a wipe to turn it.  Once she sat us, we were ignored for quite a while.  The place wasn't even that busy but our server seemed new, couldn't answer questions about multiple items on the menu, didn't offer to look into it, and just took forever.  We never received silverware until after our food was dropped by a chef that said nothing to us and then I went in to get us silverware myself.  We got the wings, paid extra to have them roasted as opposed to 'fried crispy,' and once our waitress finally came back to check us I asked for a side of the wing sauce since they didn't have much on them and she then took about 10 minutes to make that happen.  My wife and I have both worked in restaurants and we always give staff the benefit of the doubt, but this one was enough of a bland experience to write an unflattering review."}
{"text":"Great new joint where Hartigans used to be. More upscale, 30 plus beer selection and the staff is mostly Johnson & Wales so the food is off the hook. They offer three kinds of deviled eggs that are better than sushi. Tonight (Wed) is half priced wine night. Great place to take a date, not too haughty, but blueblood enough to impress and with plenty of TVs. 3 blocks from B of A stadium."}
{"text":"Decent place to get a drink and appetizers after work.

We have been going about once a week for the last several months after work for a couple of beers and light snack.   Over time the food seems to cooked with less care then when we first started going, but it is still better then average Pub food.  Not as wide a beer selection as some of the larger Pubs but you can find something to like.

Wait staff is generally attentive but not overly friendly.  They often seem to usually have friends at the bar and spend more time talking to them then serving."}
{"text":"Great place for food and local craft beers! It's a pregame hotspot for football season. They have bars outside and inside and a huge tailgate party. The staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some friends. The bourbon glazed salmon was so so fabulous, probably the best salmon I have ever had!  The server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We tried Draught for the first time last night and were definitely pleasantly surprised. We used to drive by the old Hartigan's and pray that they turned it into something better and that's exactly what they've done. The whole bar has a rustic feel as it's covered in wood and sparingly decorated (in a good way!) They have a decent craft beer list, although they could stand to offer more (better) local draughts. 

The food was incredible! We got the avocado salsa which is served with house made kettle chips. We also ordered the egg rolls which change each week. They were \"Cuban\" egg rolls and were to die for. I ordered the scallop salad which was absolutely delicious and made sure not to douse it in salad so I could bring the rest home with me (which I never do!)

The staff was really friendly and attentive. We were that annoying table that isn't ever ready to order and our server stayed patient and friendly the whole time. The manager checked in on us and made sure everyone was happy. They also have a really cool giant glass garage door that they opened up once it started to get busy inside. It really changed the atmosphere in an awesome way and brought the outside in! We got there around 6:30 but it didn't start to get busy until 8 or so. 

We are so excited about this place as we're moving into the neighborhood in December and can't wait to become regulars! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went for the game last night. Even though it was busy our waitress Katie was awesome! However the food highly disappointed w the pretzel and the nachos. The cheese dip for the pretzel was so watery along w the cheese sauce they put on the nachos. 1 star for food but 5 star for service and gameday"}
{"text":"This review is for Draught's brunch only!

First off, this place is pronounced like \"Draft\"....made that misstake!

We came here on Sunday for brunch. We made a reservation online cause I heard it can get busy (there was a very long wait by the time we left).

There is a BYO mimosa bar and bloody mary bar, which we definitely tried out. I love the build your own component cause i was able to put my own juices and fruit in my mimosa! Such a cool touch!

Ordered the cinnamon buns, corn waffle with BBQ, and side of bacon to split. The bacon wasn't anything special. However, those cinnamon buns!! They came out on a hot skillet. So delish! The corn waffle with bbq was also very tasty and had a good portion of bbq on it!

Draught's brunch game is very strong. I still havent gotten the whole thing of playing loud DJ music for brunch, but to each their own. Great spot to just chill out on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place until an incident where one of the managers ran out of the bar after my friend and assaulted him. He pushed him, put him in a choke hold and then threw him on the ground. He then said he could not leave until he paid $500. It was only after all that we found out why he even came running out. He stated my friend broke the toilet and it happens all the time and he had to pay him in order to leave. Whether he did or did not do it, which I'm pretty sure he didn't, I don't see how under any circumstances, being violent solves anything. There were 15 of us just standing there in awe of what was happening and who knows how far he would have taken I if some of us hadn't intervened. Maybe they need to rethink some of their staff. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Probably wouldn't come back ....drinks were good but I mean you can get these same local draft beers anywhere ...French dip duck was gross, pieces of fat I guess in there that I couldn't eat and even a piece of bone about the size of my pinky ! NOT OK also it was mostly bread, not slot of meat. Fries were gross, under cook and soggy. So overall I say I won't be coming back for the food at least"}
{"text":"A great place to grab a beer in the afternoon or before a ballgame. Very good beer variety and the patrons are friendly."}
{"text":"fraught was a fantastic experience. great food, great service, and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Meh. Enjoyed my beer and easy parking. The food is decent for a sports bar, but doesn't live up to the hype. From our party's sampling, I'd stick with the burgers (our table liked both the beef and the salmon) and sweet potato fries, and avoid the homemade chips (yuck), pimento cheese appetizer or flatbread."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING!!! We had wings, entrees, dessert and drinks and LOVED it all. Delicious food, great menu and the beer/wine selection was awesome. Vibe is funky but casual, loved the decor. ALL the staff, was superb, especially our waitress Nicole; she was so great. Also, location on Panther game-days will be incredible. I CANT WAIT to go back; SO SO SO GOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Very chill casual bar! good beer selections too! We've only tried their pork wings (very good) and regular chicken wings ( normal) but we love the ambiance!"}
{"text":"Was in town to visit and my friend took me to The Liberty for brunch. Pay for a bottle of champagne, and you have an unlimited bar to select from for your juices and add ons. They also had a bloody mary deal as well but we stuck with the mimosas. 

Food was good. I had the corned beef and hash. Have to add the egg on top."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to see a nice bar near my house!  With that being said, Draught is fraught with little issues that niggled at me. Yes, by the way I know Draught and fraught don't rhyme.
First, atmosphere is great. Lots of wood to counter the slightly industrial feel. Small without being tiny with the bar deviding the 2 dining spaces.
Second, help is amazing. Friendly with out being overbearing.  We kinda quizzed the bartender about our food and she knew exactly what kind of cheese was on our Flatbread. Bravo!
Third, manager was very present on the floor which I appreciate but was also a little creepy. I think he knows I'm yelping this and peering  over my shoulder, yikes. 
Fourth, the food.  So sad but also so common.  We had the pulled pork Flatbread and the fried green tomatoes. Flatbread, one word...DRY. a nice melted warm cheese would have been great on that. Fried green tomatoes, oi-vay. I'm from Florida and consider myself a bit of an expert in this area.  Cardinal rule, don't over bread, cause the tomatoes doesn't actually cook. And pan fry, not fryer.  Ugh, so not delicious.   Good start with adding the goat cheese but a long way to go. Regular Italian breadcrumb breading from Sysco, sad cause could be awesome. Final word we will be back for the great craft beers and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Panthers pre-game spot, or just a good place to watch a game in general. Extensive draft list upstairs to go with a great patio area in the basement -- perfect for playing bags. Grilled wings are a treat in the many different flavors offered, as is the beer cheese. 

However, burgers and pulled pork sandwiches were both disappointing. Burgers were overcooked and unseasoned, while the pork was bland and so wet that it soaked through the bun.

Overall, good place to drink, but the food menu is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Pretty good beer  selection (with a name like Draught, I would expect no less). Solid food offerings too. Jill did a nice job steering us to the scallop salad and the Caesar chicken sandwich. Both were filing, tasty and satisfying. Don't miss the pretzel with beer cheese!

Sunday brunch tends to skew young and the service on Sundays can be a bit (we'll just be generous here) relaxed (which is really to say absent, indifferent, and slow)."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I've ever ate for dinner. Usually I come here for panthers games which is fun. They obviously have no interest in servicing real customers. Drunk nfl fans are the ticket. Have fun with awful food and terrible service if you want to come here on a regular night"}
{"text":"We went before the panthers game. Very limited seating. Wings were the worst we ever ate. The chicken was awful. Too rubbery! The trio dip was also very unsatisfactory. The pimento cheese and chips weren't gas station worthy. The chips were extremely greasy. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm not ashamed to say that I ended up here twice in one night. Stopped by before a rehearsal dinner for a wedding. Then afterwards we took the party back over to Draught. Solid choices of beer. Great atmosphere, and a little hidden away from the city scene. Next time I'm in Charlotte I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Update:
Came back for take out tonight. They have grilled cheese on Tuesday and I think Mac n Cheese Wednesday? I was so excited/distracted by the grilled cheese, so you need to figure that out yourself. Wait...I might go back tomorrow, this could get dangerous.
They all looked tasty but, I was feeling spicy so I got the sandwich with bacon, jalapeño, blue cheese and cheddar cheese. Awesomeness. 
I side note to owner or who'll see this; I called a few times to order ahead and didn't get an answer, I did call a few times,  but I didn't want to get annoying.  

*Didn't even score a 90 on their health board investigation so I guess go at your own risk? I go here often and love the bar seating, and they always have something going on. The service can be so so,  sometimes it takes no time to get a waitress sometimes it takes 20 minutes. Salmon burger is good and so are the tacos. Just kind of thrown off my their health inspection, I try to avoid places that scored under 90. - 9 months prior to updated review"}
{"text":"My prior experiences w draught has been Panthers games - away and home.  It's a great place to be apart of Panther nation and watch some football.
Last night was the first time I went just for dinner and a non-sporting event.  
The place has always had a cool lay out - outside seating , bar seating and another level in basement.  It was a Thursday and they had a live band with the doors open for a unique and relaxing setting.
The menu has changed some but it's good -  I love the duck tacos, the grilled wings and a steak wrap - don't remember name on menu.
This is a fantastic place to watch a game and as I found last night - holds its own as a solid restaurant.  Love this place and would recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I like this place and I have a feeling I'm going to REALLY like it in months to come. I made it to the soft opening today and while it's clear there are a few kinks to work out, as any new restaurant opening may have, I think they will have them easily under control. 

To start, the atmosphere is great. They gutted Hartigans, took out the booths, added a great see through garage door (like Nan and Byrons) that will open up to outdoor seating, dazzled up the bar, redid all the wooding on the walls. It feels a lot more spacious and has a nice casual, but not too casual, vibe about it. Basically, for game days, this place will be on point. (They will have a special game day menu that I am interested to check out).

Now the menu and food! I am a fan. Their Apps are definitely the star dishes. For apps we tried the Chicken Wings in OMB Copper Buffalo and Barbalo sauce, the Pork Wings, and the Smoked Duck Tacos. Not a single thing disappointed. The wings were great, I really enjoyed the OMB Copper sauce. The Smoked Duck Tacos were very good too - the house plum bbq sauce definitely has a kick to it but it really complimented the duck. The pork wings were fantastic (Beer Braised Pork Shanks Tossed in a Sweet Chili Cheer Wine BBQ Sauce, yes, please, two times) they are pretty big and pretty delicious. 

For our meals, what I remember is the Chipotle Avocado Chicken Sandwich, Smoked Bacon Chicken Caesar Melt, Korean Bulgogi Lettuce Wraps, and a Flank Steak Sandwich (also sweet potato fries and house chips). Everything looked great, I had the Flank steak sandwich and I enjoyed it - a little too bready but I thought the amount of food was filling and tasted great. The person who had the lettuce wraps, which has flank steak in it too, thought it was a little salty but overall a great dish. 

All in all, the food was interesting in a good way; I was impressed not to see a standard menu, by any means. There are a lot of great looking things that I want to try (like the Smoked Duck French Dip and the T.E.D. Sandwich - 'Turkey Every Day,' i think thats what it stood for.)

We unfortunately didn't get to see their beer list, so I am also very interested to see that when its finally open (They will also have liquor, I believe). Given that they were still doing construction today and that it was there soft opening, you expect a few kinks. the food took quite a while to come out but I imagine that that is something that will be smoothed over in a short amount of time. The service was great though - heavily staffed, really polite waitresses. (She offered a song and dance while we waited, I mean, c'mon, that's great stuff!)

Maybe small edits once they're open but this place has GREAT potential and it looks like it will reach it. I know that once its fully up and functional that I will probably be back frequently!"}
{"text":"Went here for a going away brunch last weekend. While our server was nice $9 for a aTitos Bloody Mary is absurd. They never refilled the garnish on the Bloody Mary bar for which I paid $9 a glass. And another member of our party who was seated in a different section had to send her food back three times due to hair and metal debris in her food and her waitress called her a b!tch. Needless to say I will never go back. Plenty of other better priced brunch places that don't have a ridiculous wait time and rude staff."}
{"text":"Please note that this review is on my particular experience & it was not an average day. Plus, I have out-aged the crowded bar scene. We went for the Belk Bowl and the Georgia Bulldogs tailgating was designated to be here. Walked over a mile to find no tailgating in the parking lot! Boo! It isn't typical for the fans not to tailgate. So we went inside. It was mass chaos. Nowhere to sit. Limited access to get a drink. Everyone wanted to watch football, but there was a band inside & a DJ outside, so you couldn't hear anything. Even outside we had to shout at each other in conversation. We would have gone somewhere else had it not been such a long walk back to the other bars. It was stifling hot inside, but freezing outside. It was all around a comical situation. We managed to get a drink & an order of tasty nachos & we made the best of it. They do have a nice selection at the bar & a good menu. Thank you for carrying ginger beer! This is probably a fun place when not packed to capacity. Big plus, it is very easy walk to the stadium."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch, Bloody Mary bar is fantastic! I also recommend the chicken and waffles and the cinnamon rolls as a dessert"}
{"text":"A full mimosa bar on Sundays for brunch!!!  

The service was great and the food was awesome!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fun rustic atmosphere, great service (our server Taylor was awesome), and good drinks.  I wish there were more vegan options other than salad... everything had meat or cheese.. but I'm pretty used to that.  :(

Will definitely be going back for the Moscow Mule!"}
{"text":"My 7 year old got chicken wings. He ate them we didn't notice until after he ate half. Raw!!!!!!! Wait staff don't give a shit. I guess this place has good reviews cause people are drinking."}
{"text":"I was recently lamenting that FreeMoreWest didn't have a neighborhood bar, and poof! Draught announces their opening. Why, thank you alcoholic Genie for granting me my wish! 

I went to the soft opening and was really impressed by the comfortable, stylish interior that isn't trying too hard. I loved the open front with the garage doors, lots of TVs and private dining room downstairs you can rent for company events, family parties, etc. They added some picnic tables outside on the patio in the shadow of the uptown skyline, which is lovely in the evening. Personally I get claustrophobic with big crowds so I'm not going to be one to go on game days, but good for them for making it a huge destination. During the Steelers pregame, the whole parking lot was crazy. 

This is called Draught so I should focus on the beer and bar, but I'm not an expert on that so let me focus on where my talents lie. As others mentioned, they do not have the typical boring bar food, and I really appreciate that they have lower fat items too.  I've been for both lunch and dinner and their lunch menu has lots of gourmet delicious salads like Cranberry Apple Salad with grilled chicken and maple cider vinaigrette or Warm Kale salad and even a lemon dijon salmon burger (which I really really enjoyed!!) I can't wait to try the turkey cornbread sandwich too.  
They also have a kids menu for the littles.

Their appetizers take some classics and turn them on their head like Root Beer or Cheerwine BBQ wings, or crab stuffed deviled eggs, and pimento cheese fritters (the stud's favorite, though not the healthiest). We also tried the egg roll of the week one time and it was chicken enchiladas, and it was surprisingly delicious! 

For dinner, their entrees are definitely beyond what you'd expect from a bar: how about a Crown Royal Maple Glazed Smoked Duck Breast over a bed of wilted Purple Kale and Wild Rice or Hoisin Glazed Scallops over cucumber slaw and Orange Jalapeno Vinaigrette (good but definitely lighter). I really enjoyed the Paleo-friendly Bulgogi steak Lettuce wraps. Perfect dinner choice for me. The pasta with garlic shrimp was really enjoyed by my hubs, but I hated the chicken with pineapple marinade. I am hoping they replace that chicken dish with something else. 

If you like finishing off a dinner with something sweet like me, they bring in desserts from a pastry chef in town but I am surprised to report the berry tart was To. Die. For. Definitely worth the calories. 

Service is friendly, frequent and really prompt, even when it's a busy Saturday night which is appreciated.

Bottom line: 4.5 stars, great underrated lunch spot, and fantastic casual place to meet friends for a drink and gourmet grub."}
{"text":"Great game day atmosphere and menu. Love the mimosa and Bloody Mary bar. I got the eggs Benny with a salmon patty for brunch. It would be 5 stars except the red onion in the salmon patty was so sharp and overpowering, I couldn't really enjoy it. Otherwise awesome place."}
{"text":"Needed a patio for an afternoon of study time- great beer selection and the chicken tacos were on point"}
{"text":"The bartender literally lied to me about the specials of the day, tried to sneak an extra beer on to my bill, and then proceeded to double charge my debit card."}
{"text":"Loved the hip hop brunch! The DJ was nice enough to honor a few of our requests! Service was also good. However, our food came out cold."}
{"text":"Breakfast with a nice view of the uptown area. Our waitress was really sweet, service was great, very prompt. Breakfast was surprisingly fantastic, great mimosa bar. Would recommend for groups or 20-30s crowds. :)"}
{"text":"Draught has an excellent selection of beer, and the typical bar food is good (the nachos are amazing)... But beyond your typical bar food, the menu is just okay. I was there on a Sunday night after football season and it was pretty quiet, and the service was good."}
{"text":"I work and live less than a mile away so I've already been to Draught quite a few times. Overall I recommend it, but heed warning that it is pricier than your average neighborhood joint.

Very low key and casual vibe. Upstairs has a bar, high tops, booth and table seatings with TVs. Downstairs is usually reserved for larger groups, tailgates, late nights and football. They have a decent beer list (30 or so) but for a place called draught you'd think they'd have a few more options on tap.

Decently sized menu - everything from more standard pub pub favorites like burgers, sandwiches, flatbreads, and wings but also a few curveballs such as shrimp rice bowl, duck tacos, and lettuce wraps.

Good place for lunch, happy hour or football."}
{"text":"I went to this place because they had a patio. Unfortunately at that time it wasn't sunny out there. The wings were good and so was the beer selection. It was a little pricy but overall everything tastes good. I'd go back again for sure. I also need to check it out at night, I've heard it's poppin."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer eat good food and hangout with friends!! Brunch is great and the music is even better!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a great bar/restaurant down the road from my apartment and was excited when draught opened. I took my boyfriend with me to check out the menu, not to mention he is an executive chef and I am also in the industry. The waitress was great and the food was decent. I had the BBQ chicken Caesar salad which was good and my boyfriend had the pappardelle pasta with chicken instead of shrimp. He said the pasta was very tough, he had to cut it with a knife. But that wasn't what was bad, it was watching the sous chef walk around texting on his cell phone. Standing outside just watching the maintenance man. You can see in the kitchen and see the cooks eating and drinking and then going directly into touching our ready to eat food which really grossed us out. We watched a server put her hand in someone's food to see if it was hot which also was disgusting. I hope this place lasts but I am not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Draught is a great place to come and hang out with friends. Over the summer, they did an awesome brunch menu on Sundays, but now that football season is back, they will no longer be doing Sunday brunch.

-- Chicken & waffles is an awesome choice. There are pieces of bacon cooked into the waffle which is then topped with hand breaded and friend chicken breast. Served with a bourbon glaze syrup. 

-- The Salmon & dill Benedict is an awesome meal if you're looking to switch up your typical brunch routine ... just the right amount of lemon & dill to make it fresh yet delicious.

-- The house nachos are MUST for your appetizer selection. Topped with beer cheese, tender pulled pork, pico, BBQ sauce, and jalpenos ... YUM. 

-- The smoked bacon Cesar melt is a great sandwich, staked with a generously sized piece of tender chicken. 

-- if you're looking for a light meal, 100% recommend the blueberry walnut salad. For some extra umph, top it with a piece of nice seared salmon and don't look back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars. It's a nice spot, cool atmosphere, and has a great beer selection, but the food is just okay. I was excited to see poutine on the menu, but it horribly over salted. As far as the main entrees go, I've never had anything that really wows me, but nothing has ever been terrible. Things have mostly been bland tasting. 

The brunch is pretty good and love their make your own mimosa bar. It's also a great spot for happy hour and before/after a panthers game. But again, the food is just okay."}
{"text":"Amazing service...amazing food. We'll definitely be back. We tried the nachos, the egg roll of the week and a flatbread. The nachos were insanely good...BBQ pork on top of house made chips. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"A handful of friends and I went for dinner a few nights ago. I've been before, and each time I think it will be better, but each time it's not. I paid $14 for a basic burger and side salad (with a hair in it). Diet Coke was flat (not a big deal), but just the icing on the cake. Bathroom downstairs didn't even have a trashcan in it to throw away my paper towel? All in all, a decent place to watch the Panthers if it's not absolutely packed, but probably won't be back. Lots of potential, but keeps letting me down."}
{"text":"We stopped in before the soccer match and besides being jam packed with beer swilling fans the place was great! Our waitress whom I regretfully cannot name went over and above given the load the staff was under. On top of keeping us in food and drinks she went out of her way to be sure our two DDs (water drinkers) kept a full beverage in hand as well. The wings were really good and the beers were cold. The restrooms were clean even though they too were being put through the paces! I can see Panther Knight and Bobcat fans enjoying this venue and visitors to Charlotte as well."}
{"text":"The location and layout of the restaurant is fantastic; however, the food is terrible.  Out of my four trips here, on two occasions I've  had food that was terrible (didn't end up eating after a few bites).

Avoid this bar like the plague unless your grabbing drinks."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks. Horrible brunch food and service on Sundays. Grits were undercooked and chicken was so hard and dry I ended up just eating the waffles and ditching the chicken."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch with a friend.  We were seated immediately.  Our order  arrived very fast.  I ordered a waffle with a side of bacon.  The waffle was cooked just right and so was the bacon.  We odered the mimosa bar.  There were many juices and fruits to chose from.  I would definately go back again."}
{"text":"Spelled Draught = Pronounced Draft... all clear? Me neither, but it's okay!

Draught is one of my favorite bars in Charlotte. They have quite a list of NC brewed beers and a yummy menu to complement. I love the Korean BBQ Wraps! The House Nachos with pulled pork and house-made chips are also delish. Don't bother with the Hoisin-Glazed Scallops, there are several other yummy items on the menu (like the Pub Burger!) Overall the food, atmosphere and overall vibe are pretty awesome! I've been here on a regular night and also during a Michigan State game (I.e when Draught bleeds green) and it's always an amazing time. They even have a projector downstairs to house these infamous Michigan State games (this is a Michigan State bar btw) and of course, Panthers games!"}
{"text":"Draught is awesome! Very fun place to get enjoy a meal and a drink- or maybe a couple. The staff is the best and really attentive to their customers especially Dre the bartender. I came here for brunch that celebrated classic boy bands and DJ Corleone really had the place packed on a rainy Sunday! I ordered the \"Oh shit, I forgot my wallet in the car\" which was EXCELLENT, especially the tater tots! Loved the name of it hahaha. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings....fall off the bone delicious. Gonna be an awesome place. Great food great bar. ..lots of tvs"}
{"text":"Great food and the kitchen is  all recovering addicts what a way to give back to the community ! Great service"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to hang-out after work! We ordered pork wings, beer, Pita chips and Margharita flat bread amongst other things. My friend ordered a shrimp and she was really happy with how it was prepared. 

I am a vegetarian so I stuck to Pita Chips, they were deep friend but soggy :( Our server was a beautiful girl with a lot of patience and courtesy."}
{"text":"Entirely too smoky outside. Make the smokers LEAVE the nice outdoor seating area and smoke elsewhere. Won't return for that very reason despite the great large screen TVs and good food/beer selection. Who wants smoke puffed in their face while enjoying the great outdoors. Ugh"}
{"text":"Came here to watch a football game with some friends from out of town. We were all impressed with the delicious food and friendly service. We ordered the pork wings as an app and they were amazing! Will absolutely be returning for the good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Great spot to get beers and the food is awesome! They have multiple pumpkin beers on tap... A lot of other places always say they run out. And being a girl pumpkin beer is a must for the fall. 

Definitely recommend it- especially the nachos!"}
{"text":"Had a great time and delicious food! Solid suggestion on the jalapeño and smoked gouda mac & cheese by the bartender Samara. She was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is in walking distance from where I work so from time to time I'll suggest to go there for lunch meetings. However after this past weeks lunch I won't be suggesting this anymore. Their service is way too slow. The place wasn't even half full and it took over a half hour to get 2 burgers and a salad. Not to mention the place is way over priced for what you are getting. $12 for a salad from a bar is ridiculous. I give it two stars because the food has been tasty, just over priced for a bar."}
{"text":"I wish I had nice things to say. Went to Draught on New Years morning, the place was mostly empty. Our server was very pleasant and the food was edible, that's the only reason I'm giving two stars. 

When a restaurant serves breakfast I'd generally think coffee is a standard request. Apparently not here since they had to make a pot and they also didn't have cream. So after bringing drinks our waitress took our order, corned beef hash and short rib Benedict. About 30 minutes later she returned to tell us they didn't have short rib. Not sure why that would take 30 minutes to find out. The order took about another 15 minutes after that. Waiting 45 minutes for a breakfast order in a half empty restaurant is a bit long, but if the food was good it would have been worth it. All the food was underwhelming, corned beef hash looked like it was out of a can and tasted similar, \"hash browns\" were just basic breakfast potatoes like you'd buy in the frozen section of the grocery store. Not the worst food I've ever had, but definitely the worst in recent memory. If you do go here I definitely would recommend ordering something else."}
{"text":"Came here on a bachelorette weekend to watch the Clemson vs. NC State game.  The entire basement was full of the Charlotte Clemson Alumni Club, and we pulled off a miraculous win, so we we're already off to a great start.  

I was feeling like death from the night before.  I started of with a $4 bloody mary, that ended up being too strong for my still weak stomach, and switched to just bloody mary mix for a while.  The drink prices were awesome, with tons of $4 drinks and $15 dollar bottles of champagne.  

They had a limited menu for game day, and a lot of the food seemed a little heavy for my circumstances, but I opted for a soft pretzel which was huge and delicious! 

This is a great sports bar to watch a game with super cheap drinks.  They were very accommodating of our rowdy group of eight girls."}
{"text":"Walked in and I was greeted immediately and with a smile.  The restaurant was clean and the ambiance was inviting. After we sat down we waited about 10 minutes before being greeted.  
The waitress might of been having a bad day but no excuse, she was slow and not helpful with explaining the menu.  
The food was meh. I ordered the wings as an appetizer and those were okay.  For the main entree I order the salmon, the rice tasted like Uncle Bens microwave packs and the salmon was bland but the sauce helped out on it.
I'll give it another chance hoping the service will be better in the future."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday for some food and drinks. Great place. I loved the Pimento Cheese Fritters and the pork wings. I ordered the duck flatbread with apple butter, and I thought it was great. My friend ordered the meatloaf and I must say you all need to work on your collard greens. Oh boy those things were sooooo bland. No one at the table (7 people) liked the greens. So I think those need to be reworked asap. Overall everything else was great. Good portions, good price, and the band that was playing was really good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Saturday brunch. 15 dollar mimosa bottles, what?!?  First time here, and everything was on point.  The poutine was phenomenal and reminded me of the poutine back home in Quebec. And the chicken and waffles exceeded my expectations and even better than what they put out in DC. Both chefs as well as the owner came out to greet our party which was celebrating a birthday and made us feel at home.  A+++ customer service and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot any time of year. Football season can get crowded but only because it's the ideal tailgating restaurant - just a block or two from the Panthers stadium. The rest of the year, it's never too crowded to wait long for a table, but just crowded enough to make it a fun Sunday or Saturday brunch spot. 

The music is always great vibes and they frequently do \"themed\" brunches on Sunday with themed music. OH and the food is delicious. The menu changes pretty frequently which makes it easy to visit a lot. 

The service is always great. Food comes out very quickly and the prices are good.

Aside from everything else, you should visit solely because of the $2 mimosa special on Sunday"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. We called before coming to make sure they were playing several football games so we could watch our Broncos game. After arriving we had to wait until start time in order to find out which tv would have our game on only to find out they were only playing 2 games between all TVs. They are completely inflexible on even changing one tv to another game. Don't come here during a panthers game if you want to watch any other game. The food did look delicious and the bar looks awesome."}
{"text":"***Update: I tried the duck French Dip and it was good as hell***
Cool atmosphere,  great beer selection, ok food.  I have been to Draught to eat a few times now. I would try their duck French drip, but I wanted a beef French drip. I think it would be great if they stuck to REALLY good bar food, sandwiches and maybe a few steaks... It is more of a sports bar, so stick to that! 
Would be cool if they had a few bar games downstairs (darts, mega touch, pool... Anything?) 
Overall a cool place, but I hope some changes are made to make it cooler!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a lark around 4 p.m. to give 'em a whirl.  And glad I did.  I saddled up to the bar and ordered a shot of Monkey Shoulder Scotch Whiskey and a pint of OMB Copper.  My server was prompt, courteous, and professional.  I like that.  BTW: that's some damn good Scotch.

My order of six wings lathered in Barbalo sauce arrived piping hot within a few minutes.  Nice.  I even scored a 10% off coupon for checking in on Yelp.  Cool.  I came in happy and left happier.  Guess that's why it's called happy hour.   

I say, \"Give 'em a whirl and order a shot of Monkey Shoulder, too.\""}
{"text":"Went to Draught one Sunday because they were having a Britney vs. Christina themed brunch. I went for the music but was pleasantly surprised by the food menu. They offered some great options. I went with the chorizo breakfast tacos. They came three to an order and was more than enough to satisfy my hunger. I would recommend the brussel sprouts. They are crispy, served in an iron skillet, and have the perfect combo of sweet and savory. 
This place also has what the Charlotte brunch scene is lacking, great mimosa specials. $2 for a single, $4 for a double, and $15 for a bottle of champs. You can't beat it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was our back up for brunch at Brazwells because we knew we weren't going to make their brunch hours on time. A friend is always telling me about this place and it's brunch so it was the first that came to mind when we needed a last min restaurant. 

Pros- they have a DJ, beautiful outside area with heaters if it's too cold outside, you can bring your dog with you, brunch lasts til 4pm, and they have a good mimosa deal with different flavors(I believe it was OJ, cranberry, and blueberry when we went). If you like spice, they have a hot sauce bar with different flavors at different heat levels 

Cons- they don't give that much food at all. Although, we did want to go their simply to have food and enjoy each other's company we were definitely all still starving and maybe just a little hungry when we left too. When we were seated, the server already let us know the kitchen was out of a lot of stuff, which forced me to order the grassroots omelette and fries. My bf ordered the shrimp and grits with pimento cheese and okra (weird recipe if you ask me). It's kind of loud so you will be yelling at friends across the table. You actually make your own mimosa too (could be a pro or con depending on who you're asking)

I would probably try this place again and come a little earlier to see if my experience would change but not my fav brunch i still love Brazwells and Vivace."}
{"text":"The stars are for the food. Everything is really good, their Moscow Mules are on tap and amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food, went here for lunch and I'm planning to get here more often.  Will edit this review with more detail once I explore the menu better, there are tons of things I want to try..."}
{"text":"Attended the media event for the launch of Draught. Really impressed with the venue, staff, and menu. 

I'd only driven past the old location which was easily missed. Now you can't miss the giant lettering and awesome signage they have outside. The giant garage door basically says 'You should hang out here' because ti's going to be a fun place. 

Inside has an awesome mix of vintage looking wood, pipes, and edison bulbs. Even the floors caught my eye and complete the vintage, yet cool look. 

Their beer list is a mix of craft and domestic which I'd usually frown upon(missing my OMB Copper). Though I know they are aiming hard at the tailgate crowd so I'll let the lack of unique craft beers slide.. for now. 

The food is upscale southern with a few randoms tossed in. My table ordered the deviled eggs and duck tacos for apps - both quite good. I had the meat loaf for an entree and really enjoyed it. The mashed potatoes in particular were amazing. Tasted a little bit of everyone's food at the table. There was no loser.. I'll be back to order different things for sure. 

After dinner we got a tour of the entire place including the bonus downstairs which I didn't even know existed. Downstairs is going to be a blast during the tailgate/game time. Really looking forward to a crowded Panthers Sunday soon!

Overall I'm happy for an alternative to upscale in uptown. Don't get me wrong - I love all the bars we have on 5th street right now, but this place just has more of a pub feel. Something we really lack within the 277 loop."}
{"text":"I love that Draught finally came in and took over the old Hartigans spot!  My visit was great on a Friday night sitting outside listening to live music.  I arrived at 9:45 and they only had their late night menu available.  Which to me seems kind of early.  Most places kitchen's serve most of their menu until 11.I had the nachos and fried green tomatoes. The goat cheese paired very well with the tomatoes and the nachos were plentiful at a decent price.  The beer selection was average, but our server only knew the brewery names and not what type of beer was being served.  Doh!  This looks like it is going to be a great game day spot and I will be back for food.

Here are the things they need to approve upon.  
Late night menu should start late night.
Servers need to be educated about drinks.
I know this was a lesbian bar, but damn only one at a time in the men's bathroom upstairs? Add a couple urinals and dividers please!"}
{"text":"This place has really stepped it's game up. After going through growing pains, overall this place is really hit it's stride. 

Great food, great beers, and awesome ambiance."}
{"text":"Overpriced and lacks quality service.  My wife spent 2 hours in the restaurant during a college football gamewatch and not once did any of the 3 servers ask her if she wanted a drink.  $12 for a burger and fries, c'mon man. It was worth, at best, $8. $35 for our bar tab and that was 2 draft beers and 3 cans.  That averages $7 a beer, really?  It is another prime example of a hipster (eff hipsters, nobody likes you) bar where regular joes are overlooked and underappreciated.  We have money too, a*******.  Cheerwine BBQ tastes like garbage, can't taste the Cheerwine at all and at over $1 a wing, you'd think maybe they would invest some of that money into an actual cook to develop a real BBQ sauce - not to mention a french dip made out of duck confit?  WHAAAAT the WHAAAT?  Terrible, don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Host was really cool, we were seated right away...

Service was a letdown. 20 minutes of sitting and no \"hello, I'm such and such, can i get you a something to drink?\" It's hard cause when you're 15 minutes into waiting, you get that awkward, \"Are we gonna get service at all?\" moment. At the 20 minute mark, we got up. I went straight to the host and told her, \"We were sitting for 20 minutes, not a glass of water, no hi or hellos and I'm sorry but we are leaving.\"

I was really excited to eat there too cause their menu was really enticing. We tried to go last night but their kitchen was already closed. Today it was well open and they even had a DJ playing good tunes in their stunning harvest/industrial dining area setting.

I'm sorry the employees truly dropped the ball on this one. When people come and sit in a restaurant, USUALLY they're ready to eat and more than likely really HANGRY.

If a patron didn't get to experience your cuisine, how will they be able to rate the experience.

Sorry, I'll never be back. I took my money down the street at that Tavern that was named after the street it's on. Where we were seated, greeted, ordered our drinks then food came afterwards, all in that order."}
{"text":"Draught feels like a rough draft. It has a lot of potential but missed the mark on several points.  Situated in the shadows of the Panthers stadium and offering a nice view of uptown from the patio, Draught caters to a lot of the uptown bankers after work as well as some of the locals.It appears to be an old textile mill with wooden floors and brick interiors and exteriors.  The menu advertises \"house made pasta\" made in someone else's house (Pasta and Provisions) however they were out of it.  My wife ordered a salmon burger but they were out of that.  She opted for a veggie burger instead and I got a regular burger.  It was decent but at $12 it was a little overpriced.  They have a decent amount of beers on tap, but not as much as I expected with a name like Draught.  

Our waitress was okay but we had to ask for napkins.  My wife asked for may for her veggie burger since there was no sauce on it.  She waited a little bit for the mayo and then the waitress did not bring anything to use to put it on the bun.  I went to use the restroom and the men's room on the main floor was closed.  They directed me to one in the basement where there is another bar and more tables.

Our experience would have been a lot better if not for the points mentioned above.  I have a feeling they never have the pasta, but when a place is out of the first two of three things you want to order, you have to wonder how the place is being operated.  If the management can't order the product that's on the menu, can they really operate the place well?  The waitress did give us a 20% off card to use next time.  We'll use it and hopefully I can come back and add a star to this review."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better. The cinnamon rolls looked better then they tasted. Are cinnamon rolls supposed to be hard and crunchy??!? Our waitress was slow on the service and pretty sure it took her 10 mins to refill our coffees. And then I took a bite into the biscuits and gravy and unfortunately, they were plain with no flavor. :( The biscuits were flat and not fluffy. In fact, all the food we got was not hot at all. The only plus side to this place is the cool environment and they have a DJ that plays music during Sunday brunch. That's all folks"}
{"text":"Amazing service..... busy but the server and the chef Kurt were amazing to insure that our food and service was on top!!!! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I'm from Atlanta and came to visit this place for brunch and left so satisfied. My food was served fast. The waiters/waitresses are very friendly and warm. Also special thanks to Chef Kirt! He went out of his way to make our dining experience even more pleasurable.  Highly recommend. And the drinks are strong with great prices."}
{"text":"Nobody likes cold cheese. Cold beer cheese is a bummer. I wish the cheese on nachos had come out hot but I understand they were probably timing multiple meals to hit the table at the same time.

TV's are cranked up but if I was there to see sports I would have appreciated it. Sweet location near the stadium. I bet this place kills on game days. We snagged parking in the parking lot and there are several other lots around. The food is elevated bar food and the service was really nice. 

In the warm months this would be a nice patio for some serious sports and people watching.

Fav menu item? duck tacos. Bonus- 20% off for checking in on Yelp!"}
{"text":"I've been twice to this place so far and I've enjoyed it a lot. Pretty good beer selection, wine is pretty good but a bit pricey for the selection but Wednesdays are half off bottles of wine so go that day if you are a big wine drinker. They have good drink specials through the week especially $3 draughts on Mondays. The food has been great! I had the duck pot pie... to die for. The pimento cheese balls with the spicy sweet honey sauce.. very addicting. I enjoy the egg rolls of the week; I've had the southwestern and the shrimp and grits. My SO got the meatloaf and although I found it to be tasty he wasn't too impressed. It's pretty a standard meatloaf despite the varying \"fancy\" meats in it with typical sides.

I like the feel and atmosphere inside. They have garage doors that open and a patio that looks like it will be a nice hangout when it warms up a bit. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Draught is a great place for brunch, lunch, happy hour and pre gaming before a football or baseball game. Here's the breakdown: 

BRUNCH:
$15 champagne bottles with mimosa bar?! Yes please!! Surprisingly Draught is packed for Sunday brunch so make your reservation ahead of time. They have a special brunch menu that includes chicken n waffles, salmon benedict and shrimp n grits. However Sunday brunch will not be held during football season. Salt. 

LUNCH
I've been here multiple times for lunch. Sometimes service is slow, but the food never disappoints. I recommend the blueberry spinach salad with goat cheese and salmon. Yum! 

HAPPY HOUR
Titos Tuesdays features $5 Moscow Mules. On Mondays they have half of wings and $3 select drafts! Wine Wednesdays also feature half off bottles. Their appetizers are also great. I recommend the pretzel with beer cheese. 

PREGAME
Draught is becoming the new hot spot for all pre gaming and tailgating. During panthers games they usually close the parking lot and have beer carts out. They also have DJs come-making this place poppin before and after games."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times to watch football. The bartenders are great! The beer list is decent and they have good wine & cocktails. 

The food has been good. We live close by and would love for this to be our go to spot but the menu is limited and way too much duck!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"So I went here for two reasons, one it was a good walk from the hotel and two for the reviews on yelp!! Which did not steer me wrong, although I probably could of used a taxi back after I gorged on some stellar pub food with a twist. I have never seen a French dip with duck confit, and I will tell you it was absolutely amazing.  I had a really hard time decking on a few different things, which gives me an excuse to go back. Really cool looking industrial building, outdoor seating if you choose. The bar staff is super friendly and helped me pick what I wanted when I said I was deciding between two things she pushed the duck French dip.

Every night is a different special and hey 10%off with a check in yelp!!"}
{"text":"Can't even! My mind is blow!!! We have been here for almost 2 hours...I just got my sweet rolls that were completely raw, not cooked- comes in a cast iron pan which we thought would be very hot but since we have waited so long it was not.
My friend was here an hour before he got his beer and when we asked about it the server said \"they told me they brought it to\" which is a lie because she immediately went to the computer! They posted on Facebook this as an event which is a joke. We have seen 3 groups come in, sit down, get no service and leave. Our server is so frustrated by the communication you can tell.
We ordered tater tots which should take 3 mins it was over 45. We sat outside and were told that the service was very slow and we were crazy patient but this was extreme. No one told several employees about the \"event\" so this poor man was down stairs trying to sell brisket and no one knew about him. There were supposed to be DJ's but no one showed up. Oh wait another group walked out! Super disappointed since my friend flew here from NH and we chose this as something to do!!! We are leaving!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been here a few times now and everything has been well above average. The staff is friendly and accommodating, the building itself is open and clean, good beer selection, and the food is delicious! I recommend the wings or the TED sandwich with house chips. Great place to eat, drink, watch sports, and socialize alone or in a big group!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan, but sometimes it's just a-ok. I enjoy the fact that it's an easy walk down the Draught Path (my name for the recently paved path leading to Draught from Wesley Heights) and it's really the most accessible sports bar to get to on foot. 

While i love the Monday night special of $3 beers, they have nothing for vegans to eat aside from fries and the avacado salsa which is just chunks of avacado, tomato, onions and jalapeno with chips. Not bad, but not enough for a meal, so we always have to eat elsewhere before going here for drinks. Unfortunately their veggie burger has egg. Not that i expect every place to have vegan options, but the two times we have brought others here who did eat full meals, they were not returning for food. I even took a picture of their disappointing meal, but will have to go through old pics to track it down.
The servers have always been friendly and they have a pretty nice space and little patio and even a downstairs with more tvs and another bar and a bigger bathroom (that I didn't know existed until my 3rd visit).
I'll definitely keep coming here for the beer (although it doesn't seem to rotate too much) and if for no other reason, our US men's and women's soccer teams are a combined 3-0 so far watching from Draught."}
{"text":"Great people and atmosphere with a creative and so far, delicious Menu.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great experience end-to-end.    The hostess and bartender were very courteous, didn't pressure us to order or find a table of our own.    Very laid back, and fun atmosphere; there was even a band starting to play as we left.    Noise level was just enough that my date and I could have a conversation without yelling at each other(let's face it; you've been to other places like that).    The atmosphere is very low-key, not uptight, very casual.    Good beer selection.    Had the duck tacos, my date had the pulled pork flatbread.   Slightly well done, but tasty nonetheless.    I will be back."}
{"text":"So after many mixed reviews about Draught I finally decided to try it out for Sunday Brunch. After hearing a few friends mention much they enjoyed the atmosphere there for Brunch my friends went. 
Being located so close to uptown, the parking is not the best. It can get hard to drive around the parking lot once its busy and to find a parking space. After parking I went in and placed our name on the waiting list for a party of 8. The hostess said she did not know if she could accommodate that many people and it was 45 minute wait. After walking around to find a spot at the bar to get a drink I saw that there were several parties that had more than 8 in their party so I was confused on why she mentioned my party possibly couldn't be accommodated. Anyway, my friend and I stood at the bar to get a mimosa and the bartender was very short with us and rude for no apparent reason. We ordered mimosas and was informed to go over by the Bloody Mary station to get orange juice or cranberry juice and fruit to add to our champagne. The station only had juice no fruit and no one seemed to know exactly when or if there would be anymore fruit added to the station. 
Once we were finally seated inside, the service was pretty slow. It took our waitress awhile to finally come and take our order. My party all ordered at the same time but they brought out our food almost 1 entrée at a time. I received my French Toast sandwich first at the table and another entrée did not come out for another 10-15 minutes. I did not understand why the whole tables food would not come out together. The French Toast sandwich was not impressive. The chicken was not seasoned and the sandwich itself was not flavorful. No one else in my party was impressed with their food as well all ordered different entrees.

The only thing we enjoyed was the DJ, who was playing a lot of good hits and the half mimosas we ordered. 

Once we finally got our tickets and paid, we all walked out the restaurant and immediately behind us a fight broke out between the employees. The same rude bartender that served us in the beginning had a pretty serious altercation with another employee. I was totally disappointed watching this altercation take place. The restaurant had to close for the rest of the day. Sadly this place could be a great spot for drinks after work or Sunday Brunch but it just did not do it for me at all."}
{"text":"Brunch is always on point, especially chicken & waffle. Very succulent & juicy chicken. Mimosa deals are on point. DJ on Sundays normally sets up around 1pm to spin a set. 

On a regular day, food & service is always on point. Friendly bartenders with great beer selection. Catvh the game, catch up with friends or roll dolo at the bar and its all good."}
{"text":"Really like this place ! It's hard to find a pub type atmosphere that offers food suited for early in the day. The corned beef hash was very good. Usually this dish would be expected to be all ground-up together, like hamburger. Not here !  You can actually identify the corned beef spread aver the hash-browns, with grilled peppers and onions.  Christina did an excellent job of serving both food and drinks. We really enjoyed talking with her."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place....great ambience and very pose spot...but that is all that is good. Sat at our table for 20 minutes watching servers and staff help other tables without anyone greeting us or taking our drink order. We ended up leaving and expressing to the host bout why we were leaving. She ended up just apologizing and going back to her business. Would I go back there.....heck no! Would I recommend it to anyone...heck no! Did I just write a bad review.....heck yeah! ^_^"}
{"text":"Amazingggggg!!!! We just got brunch here and everything was so good!!! The chefs were so sweet and nice and the menu has a variety of things that anyone will love!!!! I didn't know draught had brunch but it will definitely be a staple in my weekends now!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for a job functions and yelped this nice little spot. Great view of the stadium and awesome service. The bartender was probably the best one I had in two months. I got some wings and they were crispy and flavorful just like I expected. 

My only concern/drawback is that the fries just weren't that good. They were the old fashioned kind and they may have been fresh but those are just so hard to tell about. 

Overall I was very pleased with my food and so was my friend. I thought that the bartender was awesome and his service really made it for me."}
{"text":"Staff were very friendly but have they cleaned the beer lines lately? We sampled 3 different beers and they tasted a little musty.  Breakfast selections were good!"}
{"text":"Decent food for sure and granted, I knew a Monday night football game would be busy but...and here we go: don't advertise the HELL out of your amazing $3 draft and 1/2 price wing special on Monday if you're not going to honor it on a Monfay when the Panthers play!! I felt suckered in and then on top of not honoring the specials, the beers are $6 for a plastic cup draft!! WTF that is sick and totally ridiculous. The wings were amazing for sure but we didn't know they weren't 1/2 price until after we ordered and ate them...shifty! Especially since the dang Monday night special was still even on display right outside the bathrooms! Then, they got busy and couldn't handle it at all...went back for a second order of wings...45 minutes later, no wings so I had to stalk my server and tell her to just take them off and get me a check...that was 10 mins ago, still waiting on the check ...ugh"}
{"text":"If only Yelp let me give half stars, this would be a 4.5! After buying a Living Social deal that got us $30 in food, the fella and stopped in on a Thursday after work. What took us so long to try this place??

We were lucky to snag a parking spot in the lot outside, and we got there before it got crazy full (like it was when we left). Local beers were on special, so that's what we stuck with. For a place called Draught, the beers on tap were a little... underwhelming. However, we pressed on. The inside is pretty cozy with wood paneling and huge, windowed garage doors that run the length of the place. We sat at a table, but the bar was pretty cool and seemed to U-shape around the dining area.

Since duck was everywhere on the menu, we started with the duck tacos (3 for $9), and they were deeeelicious. For dinner, I got the Blueberry Walnut Salad with chicken ($13), and it was bowl-licking good. I loved that it came in a bowl deep enough that everything didn't spill over the side when I tried to mix it up. The fella almost went with the meatloaf, but switched to the Pork Wings (5 for $11) when he saw the guy at the table next to us get them. I never got a bite, but considering he was gnawing on the bone, I'd say they were pretty good.

Besides the underwhelming draft list, the only other reason I'd knock off a smidgen of a star was the acoustics. There were a decent amount of people in there for sure, but it was so loud we had to yell at each other, and it didn't seem like it should've been that loud.

Surprisingly good food at what I always thought was just a bar!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at this restaurant and the service is bad, yet again. Both times we came for brunch for a party of about 10-20 people. The servers and hostess were not friendly and even today .... for a party of 25 people, they gave us one server. The drink orders were extremely slow, the food orders were extremely slow, and it took forever to get the food. 

Brunch is a big deal in Charlotte, so I understand busy restaurants, however customer service is a key component. I would not recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a level of professionalism and food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Great food, good drink specials, HORRIBLE service... I've been a server before and saw our beer sitting at the end of the bar, ready to go... TEN MINUTES later I had to walk up to the bartender and explain that I knew it was for our table..... He looks at the receipt and finally gives it to me.. Sad when you have to fight for your own beer!"}
{"text":"Food is a roller coaster ride....some days they nail it, some days not!  Today my chicken sandwich no bun was about the size of a McDonalds chicken nugget!  Service usually stinks, I've gotten used to that, but when the food stinks on the same trip, makes for a complete \"drought\"!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and ordered fried catfish and grits. It was. Little difficult to eat. The portion of fish was much bigger than the portion of grits. They were whole pieces so I had to cut it up myself or dip it. The atmosphere was welcoming. I would try this place again but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Stopped in at draught on a gorgeous early April, midweek afternoon about 1:30p.  Sat just inside the open garage doors.  My bride of 36 years, our daughter #2 and I...visiting daughter #1 who was hard at work preparing for a Charlotte Knights home opener.

The place was ours for the taking! An easy, relaxed day that this triad hadn't had in some time.  We enjoyed the Korean Bulgogi Lettuce wraps with jullianned carrots, cucumbers and pickled red onions and the house avocado salsa with chips (actually fresh house made, deep fried potato chips, not tortilla chips).  Throw in some local brew pulls and our afternoon was complete.

Our first thought was what a fun place for the locals! Good food, good conversation, maybe some good live music if that was in the offing.  The only down side we saw was we would not be around for a second try.

If you are in the Queen City, we recommend a visit"}
{"text":"My first Dinner Experience here, although we were here for Tarheel Game Watch earlier in the day and hoping for Brunch?lunch at 2pm, they DO NOT serve Lunch until 4 pm, so we decided to come back at Dinner.

It is ironic that in Jacksonville. Fl for the Carolina Club Game Watches our best server and honorary TARHEEL (MacKenzie) was part of the group and a wonderful server, now we move to Charlotte and we end up with a wonderful server also named McKenzie ( I apologize for the spelling if incorrect).

Service was fast, Food was hot and Delicious,  she was helpful, friendly and courteous.

The Bro and Sis N Law Also enjoyed their Dinner here and the wife who tends to be picky enjoyed her experience also.

We will be back and possibly our new favorite plpace for Dinner, not so much for Brunch/Lunch!! LOL"}
{"text":"What a let down... 

Went here with my parents when they were visiting me in Charlotte. We were super excited about the 40 craft beers on draft (according to their website).  I only counted 30 on the menu, and that included about 10 that were far from craft beer (i.e. Bud Light, Shock Top etc.). 

Service was dodgy... beers were never kept full and our waitress seemed stretched thin over all of her tables on the patio and indoors. She said it was taking so long because so many were ordering Guinness, the drink special. It just seemed like they were understaffed.

My dad complained to me about the line for the bathroom. I guess the mens room is a one seater and a urinal, but there aren't stalls, so everyone was waiting in the hall.  If there was a line for the mens, I'm glad I didn't have to try he womens!

The food was good... but when you name the establishment Draught, I would experience more of a craft beer selection. Even with 30 taps, they were lacking variety."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited recently on a Thursday night. We were big fans. I never went here when it was Hartigans, so I can't do a before and after, but I can say the after is very nice. The look is very cool, the service was friendly and the food was good. I had the salmon burger and sweet potato fries, which were good (although the burger wasn't quite as good as it sounded to me). The wife had a salad that she really liked (although it was fairly small considering it was about $13 - $15 after adding a piece a salmon). We'll definitely be going here regularly."}
{"text":"Great location for Panthers game. Located right behind the stadium. Given the name of this place, I wasn't overly impressed with their beer list. They did however have a few good local choices. Food was average . Service was very good . I had the chicken Caesar sandwich- way too much bread involved and my sandwich was cold."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review but the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because I've always had a great time here on game days. Tonight we came for a preseason game to get a couple beers and some food and the service and food was about as bad as the Jaguars quarterback situation. 

Their excuse was that they didn't expect this many which is comical considering they are \"the\" Panthers bar. Our nachos were straight out of the fridge and I could have brewed my own beer faster than their service.

Sad to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"First let me say that the interiors are pretty awesome.  I like the feel of the place and the patio looks like a solid place to hang out and day drink or relax in general.

The food choices are unique and I'll have to explore more next time but this visit I had the lettuce wraps.  They were tasty and great but a bit of a tough one to eat with out chewing like a rabid dog.  I know korean beef is tough so maybe I should have thought that through.  My advice, if you're on a first date, don't get the wraps.  You'll make a mess most likely.

The staff was struggling during our visit it seemed but I noticed they started to get plates out quicker as our lunch hour went on.

The beer list seemed solid, although I kind of expected a more unique list of taps available.  With a name like Draught I just imagined a more extensive variety.  

The parking seems a little limited but not impossible."}
{"text":"Was here for the ACC Championship game and the place was packed on gameday. However, the staff was unreal responsive and friendly."}
{"text":"Draught is a great place to get local craft beer and delicious food. There was live music set up outside that was fun to listen to, but not too loud that you couldn't hold a dinner conversation. 

We started with grilled wings with sauce made from OMB Copper and pork wings made with a cheer wine sauce. They both tasted delicious. They feature a lot of dishes with duck in them and a great build your own burger in which you can have a burger patty or a portabella cap. The Third Ward Special was very unique -- duke confit on a warmed roll with duck jus. It may taste gamey for some people's taste, but we really enjoyed it. 

We will definitely be going back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"What's not to love here? Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar complete with a DJ for Sunday funday...weekly egg rolls and Dr. Pepper flavored wings washed down with a Tito's Vodka on tap. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Visited on Monday afternoon. Bartender was very unfriendly and rude. We placed a food order, and after waiting 10 to 15 minutes the bartender came to inform us they didn't have once of the items we are ordered. We decided to order two pretzels. They were extremely salty so we could only eat the inside. The beer cheese was horrible. Anytime we would thank the bartender she never once said your welcome and we watched in disbelief as she was beyond unprofessional to one of the other patrons. This establishment had a good selection of beers and a cool atmosphere but the service was horrible and the food left a lot to be desired. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very friendly place, good vibes, drinks were great, and Chef Kirt is amazing! I'd definitely recommend this place to all of you..."}
{"text":"So Draught has an awesome location! It is right behind the Panther's Stadium, walking distance to uptown, and along a small greenway. Unfortunately, this is most outstanding quality about it. 

The draft/craft beer selection is decent, but if you frequent Charlotte breweries, it's nothing new. 

As far as the food goes, everything is pretty decent, but the variety is the issue. There is extremely little for dietary needs like vegetarian or gluten-free. I eat pescetarian, so I've had the salmon burger each time I've gone and it has good flavor, but does fall apart as you try to eat it. At least the fries are very good and well seasoned! 

On my last visit, I came with a group of 5 people around noon on a Saturday. The place was full, but not over-packed and they were able to accommodate us with a 4-top and pulling up a chair. However, the service was awful because I think they had one bartender, one cook, one waitress, and one hostess. For a Saturday brunch, they were extremely under-prepared. It took forever to get water, let alone 5 of them, and refills. Our food was partially given to another table and then came out at all different times. The worst of it was that no apologies were made whatsoever.

Out of all the sports bars with craft beer in Charlotte, I think I might pick another one next time :/"}
{"text":"Don't go for the game day food. Doesn't hold a candle to Hartigans food.  Atmosphere is ok but the chicken was super dry and the bread was stale and crumbly. Close to the stadium tho which is good."}
{"text":"Went there after pickup soccer game, just for drinks.
First, table we seated was falling apart, with as a result the beer spilling over the table every time you leaned on it.
Second, waiter was having his period. 
Third, beer was crap. I ordered Fresh squeezed IPA, which is great beer, but the pour I got wsa cloudy, even after sending it back. And then to be charged $7/glass is unacceptable. 
Will not go back, rather drive 10 more mins do decent bar."}
{"text":"Had a chance to celebrate a friend's birthday at Draught! Great company, nice vibe and delicious food. 
Bottles of champagne to be enjoyed with the Mimosa Bar ...$15 which is a good deal and added touch for your dining companions.
I ordered the sweet potato waffles and chicken...served with real butter, warm syrup and fresh fruit...yummy!
I will definitely be back to try lunch or dinner menu."}
{"text":"After hearing lots of good things about this I made it a point to give this place a shot. Came here one Sunday night to grab a bite to eat and watch some football. TVs, cold beer, good food & football. What more can someone as for, right? I had the nachos which were fantastic -- came with pulled pork, tons of cheese -- and they use crinkle cut potato chips which seemed homemade. I also had the pub burger which was solid...not out of this world but pretty good. 

Service was great as our server constantly checked in and kept the cold beer coming.
This place is right next to the BOA stadium and I can totally see it doing well on game days. Overall, I have no complaints about this place. I would recommend it to ANYONE looking for a good bite to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with great food, strong drinks and superb staff. The mimosas on Sundays are unbeatable. The food is plentiful and delicious. On weekends, there is easy parking. It should be your go-to place for now on. 
I did warn them that I was allergic to gluten and they made accommodations. Burgers were LEGIT (none of that dainty pathetic patty) and the Brussels sprouts are a must-have. I heard the Panthers waffles are good but next up, I'm getting the buffalo chicken egg Benedict."}
{"text":"The blueberry walnut salad is heavenly. They have great take out and dining in - nice people working there and eating there. Good community."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere for brunch... We had a few mix up with our food and obviously some miscommunication with the server and the kitchen staff! All in all, I would visit again. They have $15 bottles of champagne along with a mimosa and bloody Mary bar! That's a plus for me! I also had a short rib Benny! It was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Draught for a Cufflinks and Cocktail event during the week. The upstairs section was pretty busy but our event was held downstairs. There was a small bar and tables and what looked like maybe a space for a musician/band. I ordered one of the drinks that were on special and had their lemon pepper wings. The wings and drink were pretty good. I think they might have been slightly overwhelmed with the size of the crowd but I thought it was a pretty neat place. I would like to go back for dinner one day and a drink .  I also checked in with my Yelp App and received 20% off my bill ! Yay  
There is parking lot right beside the bar, but there is also parking further up the street."}
{"text":"When I moved into the area 6 months ago, this was the go-to spot for everything.  Drinks after work with apps, a quick great dinner on a weeknight instead of cooking, and brunch on sundays.

Fast forward to this past week.  The new brunch menu is bland and has tiny portions for the price compared to everywhere else in the city.  They got rid of their best apps, as well of all of their best sides.  The dinner menu is baren, and unless you want a salad or a plain burger with cheese you're out of luck.

I really hope they can find a way to reverse all of the changes they've made.  The best advice I can give them is if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Unfortunately right now, they're trying to drive a car with no wheels."}
{"text":"I've had good experiences at Draught overall, but this past Saturday was pretty disappointing, thus the 3-star review. Our food was given to another table, and my salmon burger, though delicious, showed up a solid 20 minutes after everyone else was served because it had to be remade. It was tasty, but it would have been nice if our server at least recognized the inconvenience and/or provided some sort of discount. Of course, this didn't happen.Thank goodness for the mimosa bar - our afternoon's saving grace. 

If you're looking for a local place to grab some drinks and watch football, Draught provides the right atmosphere -- decent size patio, additional space roped off for more standing room on a Panthers game day, and plenty of TVs in and out to watch your team. For brunch/lunch with a group of friends, though, you're better off somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre here... I always feel like I am inconveniencing people when I am there.

Food is much better than the service.  I like the shrimp and grits the most.  I also like the mac and cheese fritters.  Beer prices are average.  

The outdoor seating is really nice and the ascetic of the place overall is really strong."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday. Lots of industry professionals having drinks after work. I ordered he 10pc pork wings..... Worth every bite! Loved it! The sauce they were coated in was pretty tasty. Be aware of the parking lot. It can get crowded. I parked in the next lot over one"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food!! 

First order of business...drinks. They had 4$ mimosas, I'll take 5, just keep em coming! I always know I'm going to have a good dining experience when there are actual drink specials, not just your typical 3$ bud and bud lights. They had a few others as well that my boyfriend and friends took advantage of. 

We ordered the house nachos to start, OMG they were amazing. So different compared to normal nachos, these were made with in house made chips, creamy cheese, some sort of sweet/tangy BBQ sauce I believe and then all the good add ons. We could not get them in our mouths fast enough! I'll go back to Draught just to get the nachos again. 

I got the buffalo chicken tacos....they were fantastic. I mean you can never go wrong with buffalo anything. If I could eat buffalo style for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I totally would and would be proud of it! 

I can't wait to go back to Draught soon, especially once football season starts again and for Brunch on Sundays (mimosa and bloody mary bar!!!!)"}
{"text":"The place was packed! It was hot, sweaty, full of people, even during the day- great turn out. The service was horrible. For $26 I got 4 oz of mixed drink, poured into 4 glasses and called shots. Please don't waste your money at a place like this. They have no grasp on customer service because they serve so many people. For reference, they are 3oz glasses I my picture (the BT made sure to put the bottom of the cup I my fave when I questioned my $7 ounce of mixed drink). If less than one star was possible, they earned it, but I have to give at least one star to post my review."}
{"text":"I really try not to hype myself too much about a place before trying it myself to give them a fair shot, but after much anticipation, I finally got to try Draught (pronounced Dra:ft)!!

It was a Thursday evening and we got there before the Thursday Night Football crowd.  No wait for a table, and our waitress let us pa ruse the menu before deciding on Pimento Cheese Fritters and the 3rd Ward Special:  Smoked Duck French Dip sandwich and fries.  The place had me at \"Pimento Cheese\" but when you fry it up into awesome bites, it just makes it that much better!  The smoked duck french dip was so delicious that it was pretty much gone in 60 seconds.

There is a rather large parking area for being that close to uptown and the space is super nice.  I like the use of wood and modern/clean lines.  There are tv's galore for watching games/sports and a good selection of local beers on tap.  I can see this place being a great place to meet up and tailgate before a Panthers game and/or even a Knights baseball game."}
{"text":"I met here with my dinner group for our monthly dinner.  

The first things I've noticed is all the changes from the previous tenant in this building.  Gone are the dark green walls and clutter above the bar and replaced with lighter walls, reclaimed wood, hard wood floors, and large TVs on the walls. The space behind the bar was also expanded to cover much of the open space to below to create additional restaurant floor space. Knowing what kind of work this place needed, the owners of Draught really put in a lot of work and money in to this restaurant.

They have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but I was not drinking tonight so I could only notice the selections. Next time, I'll try the beer.

The menu consists of an eclectic mix of burgers, salads, apps, entrees and a few flatbread pizzas. I'd describe it more as Gourmet comfort food but the prices and portions were decent.

Service was great here even though our server disappeared for a time between our drink order and our dinner order but she apologized for it and was great with everything afterwards.  

So why just 3 stars? Well the first two entrees I selected were unavailable.  They were out of scallops and did not have a pasta dish.  My 3rd option was salmon with a hoison sauce.  The sauce overwhelmed the salmon so I would suggest cutting back on that.

Still, I would like to come back here and give them another try. I see potential here. And I do want to try the beer."}
{"text":"The stars are for the food, not the bar service.  

I usually sit at the bar and sat there for quite a bit of time.  Got up, walked over to the Mimosa Bar to check it out.  Came back, sat down...watched the bartender walk past me several times, ring stuff in to the register (right in front of me) and... nothing. He was more interested in keeping his hair in place I think. 

A he walked past me once again I (yes, loudly) said hello!?  can I get a menu. and a drink.  and some food.  It ended up being funny because the girl sitting next to me leaned over and said she had to do the same thing.

I did order a mimosa and got to add my own juice to it, which isn't that big a deal. I'd rather just have the choice and have the bartender take care of the whole thing.   The bartender did give me a glass of bubbly \"on him\" to make up for his inattention, but kind of ruined it by sticking his finger in it to flick something out of it.  (alcohol kills germs, right?)

So I got the egg rolls which were pizza egg rolls.  They were very good.  Crispy, good pepperoni and cheese ratio.  

The Flank Steak Sandwich was also very good.  I got it on a brioche which held up well.  Plenty of meat, good amount of cheese, mushrooms and grilled onions.  It came with horseradish cream sauce, but I wish I had gotten a side of it because there wasn't enough.

I had asked for some honey dressing on the side to go with my sweet potato fries and also horseradish sauce on the side, but the bartender didn't remember to bring either one of them and I got tired of asking him to remember.  I had to ask him twice for my beer.

They have a good amount of beers and plenty of local ones.

I like it the food, but I think (at least at the bar) the service doesn't do the kitchen justice.

Not a football or any other major sports day, and not a lot of people in, so not sure what was up with the bartender."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, apart from the 8 bouncers in black standing around doing nothing other than trying to look menacing. Seriously, why are there that many bouncers on a Sunday for an away game? I liked that the downstairs had a DJ who plays music during commercials on game day, very fun! My food has not been great though (as a vegetarian). Black bean burger was very dry, as was the flatbread. Fried green tomatoes would be better with the goat cheese served on top rather than cooked inside the breading, because it leaks out during cooking. Fries were underdone and flaccid. I will go back though!"}
{"text":"After 27 minutes of watching waitresses walk by without a glass of water or a drinks menu I got up and asked for a server. It was busy, but 4 employees were having a personal conversation near the hostess station, lack of service was not due to being hit with a rush. While the waitress I nabbed was pleasant, my order was incorrect but I was very hungry by this time and we ate it anyway. The food was good the beer was great and the outdoor seating had appeal - the owner really needs to hire a floor supervisor to oversee the wait staff before they run his investment into the ground. I will try it again in a few months, the place is near where I live and I would like it to succeed."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch and was disappointed. The menu is really abbreviated and only has about 5 options. I asked the waitress what her favorite meal was and she replied the shrimp and grits. I couldn't decide between that and the chicken and waffle but she explained the waffle was a cornbread waffle and it was blue. i dont think I can eat a blue waffle. I also order a mimosa. They only bring the champagne and then there is a mimosa bar that you can add your OJ and fruit. Luckily, or table was close to the bar (well shelf with OJ and fruit sitting on it), I would be upset if I had to continuously walk over there every drink I ordered. There was a bar for the bloody mary's too. I don't like the concept. My shrimp and grits came out and it was nasty. The grits were runny. Nothing was seasoned. My BF ordered the burger he said was ok. I don't eat beef, so I didn't try it. His fries were good. All in all, I will not be back, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for whiskey and pre/post Jaguar football.  Great outdoor environment and fun people watching!"}
{"text":"For bar food this place takes the cake. This was our kickball bar and so we have plenty of late nights in the downstairs area having a good time, but the food here is great. I've tried a number of dishes and have never been dissatisfied. The have plenty of dishes with duck that are quite tasty. The wings and pork shanks are incredible, and they have interesting sauces to go with (the Cheerwine BBQ is my favorite). Definitely a great spot to hang out while watching a game or going out with friends!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar located next to the Panthers arena. Great menu and staff. Convenient parking. Fabulous brunch during the Panthers off season. Great place to host private events in the downstairs from work meetings to rehearsal dinners, bridal showers and more."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Awesome atmosphere and really good food. But I will never come back due to the customer service I received. It was extremely packed due to the panthers game so I decided to go wait in line for the Porta-Jon. A man approached me rudely and told me I was in the walk way and needed to move. Everyone I was standing with was in the same spot I was but I was the one rudely approached. I told him he didn't have to be rude about it and his respond was \" I'm the manager here and you need to move\". He left and came back a min later and tried to kick me out of the restaurant because I \"still had not moved\". The manager was a shorter gentlemen with dark brown hair. I can't believe he is even a manager and able to talk to customers like that. He was so disrespectful to me and because of that I will  never come back. That really sucks because I really enjoyed myself there."}
{"text":"Came for the Yoga, stayed for the brunch. Had the tachoes (tater tot nachos), a cheesy, bacony, pickled peppery, pile of goodness served in a personal pan cast iron and topped with a fried egg. Saturday goals forever. Husband got the shrimp and grits. Cleaned his plate. Nom. Best part? They pair the brunch specials with a beer and serve complimentary pimento cheese scones with apple butter that can only be compared to the feeling of being granted amnesty from purgatory into heaven. Saturday goals forever."}
{"text":"Great patio, great beer selection. We come here when we are walking in the neighborhood. You can sit outside and see the skyline, while enjoying a neighborhood feel. The food items and the service can be hit or miss, but they have some good daily food specials and the Tony Luke sandwich is the best!"}
{"text":"We came here before the Panther fest. I was worried they were going to be packed but it really wasn't that bad at all. We got sat right away outside but it was covered. Our server was on point. She got our drinks and food order quick.

Several of us got the fish tacos. They were delicious and filling. It was hard deciding between a few other things. They have a good variety on the menu. Our server did a great job refilling the beer and drinks. We didn't have to wait long to get our checks either. Overall, the experience was great."}
{"text":"The food was awesome especially the pork wings which I had never seen before. The key lime pie was also on point. Last but not least the bartender 'T' she is the best and deserving of a special thank you for such a nice welcome to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 8 to watch college football last Friday night. About an hour into our stay, we were 1 of maybe 4 tables with people on the main floor. The service was horrendous. Basically, our server would maybe check on us every half hour, usually only if we waived her down, and would only ask half of the table if they wanted more drinks, food, etc., before running away. I would have understood if the place was packed but there were literally 4 tables full. Had we gotten even some semblance of service we definitely would've spent a lot more money and had a way better time. Sucks because this was going to be our go-to bar for the college football season. Not anymore."}
{"text":"I am so happy Draught is here. The location is so convenient to the stadium, the decor on the inside is relaxing and the food ranges from solid bar food like wings to more foodie choices. The meatloaf was excellent as the sauce made the dish. We fought over the last pimento cheese fritter appetizer. So creamy and delicious. This is going to be a fun after work hangout."}
{"text":"Considering how much time I spend in this place, I thought it was time for a review update. I also just sat here and read a bunch of reviews, and it made me want to address and point out a few things. Oh and once again remind you, Draught is pronounced like draft. 

Food wise: I love the pork wings and all the tacos. I usually always order whatever the egg roll of the week is with my meal. House nachos are great. They're super different and a nice southern twist on a classic bar food. A pretzel and beer cheese are the way to my heart. The Third Ward Special has been one of my favorites since the beginning. I saw someone complain and say they wished it wasn't duck. Well, if you want one that's not duck, go somewhere else. Or better yet, open your own place. Sounds silly right? Well, now think how silly you sound for saying it. Draught also has great specials throughout the week. $5 Tito's Mules on Tuesdays, half price wine on Wednesdays, Thirsty Thursdays. 

This is THE spot for Panthers games. If you think you're going to come in here and get a 5 course meal by candlelight, this isn't the place to come on game day. Come on, man. It's not rocket science. Of course there's a limited game day menu. Of course it's slammed. Of course service may be a little slower. Of course there's a line for the bathroom. Don't get mad if they won't put the Broncos game on for you. Guess what? It's a Panthers bar. And they can't accommodate five different people's requests to see the Broncos, Cowboys, fill in the blank other team that one person wants to watch. College football wise, they are home to Clemson and Michigan State. Don't walk in here on a Saturday and be shocked to see 200 Clemson fans. And again, don't bitch because they have a game day menu. I assume brunch will be back after football season. Two words: MIMOSA BAR. Any place that let's me buy a bottle of champagne and dress it up with a whole bunch of different juices and fruits wins in my book.

Draught has a great event space downstairs. I've attended engagement, birthday, holiday, and even draft (not to be confused with Draught) parties here. It's a good space you can pretty much dress up for whatever occasion. I love the roll up garage doors and patio area as well. Nice spot to grab after work drinks. 

Kudos to the staff. Between setting up tailgates and outdoor areas and dealing with the army of drunk people who wander over after the game, I know gamedays are long days. Thanks for giving Charlotte such a great place to cheer on the Panthers! Rarrrrrrrrr"}
{"text":"After hearing good things, I had a less than stellar experience at Draught this past weekend.

A group of friends and I ran in the Charlotte marathon relay and headed here post-race to grab a bite and a drink. The service was really terrible and I couldn't believe they were so understaffed/under-prepared for a Saturday. The restaurant was full but not overflowing, and the hostess and servers were really struggling. The orders at our table didn't come out together, and we had to remind them what we ordered. Also, our water was not refilled the entire time we were there. I was really disappointed with how disorganized the staff was.

The food itself was decent. I was a little underwhelmed by the vegetarian selections - it would really be nice to find a good sports bar with more than salads for us vegheads. I also enjoyed their mimosa bar but would have liked to see more brunch food options available to match the mimosa vibe.

Really this venue is fine if you need a place to grab a drink and watch a game, but don't expect good food service if you're looking to sit down and have a meal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  First time actually eating here and I had the meatloaf with collars and red mash potatoes!!  Extremely impressed!!  Not to mention management and staff where very pleasant and greeted me as I walk in. Also a great beer selection!!  Looking forward to seeing there cocktail menu once they really get up and running!!  Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"I attended \"drake brunch\" and it was probably the most fun over ever had at brunch. There was a bit of a wait, but when your downing mimosas, the wait is fun lol. Atmosphere was awesome. I had chicken and waffles and they were good, not the best I've ever had, but pretty good."}
{"text":"Basing this review solely on service, not on food (as I didn't get to try any). Having heard great things about Draught brunch, I was excited to try it this morning - especially the mimosa and Bloody Mary bars. After checking online to see when they opened (11 am), my fiancé and I showed up at 11:15 to meet some friends, who drove down from the Northlake area. After walking up to the restaurant, we were informed by an employee sweeping outside that they were pushing brunch back an hour to 12 since they had been really busy the night before with the crowd from the ACC championship. A little annoying, but we decided to just kill some time in uptown for 30 minutes and head back. At 12, we wandered back over, hungry and ready for those mimosas, only to be told by another employee that they were now pushing brunch back to 1 pm to continue cleanup. At this point, we gave up and left to try and find another brunch spot. I understand being swamped and having to delay brunch, but there was absolutely no update on Facebook or social media to warn customers of the delay. And then to tell us 12 pm and not be ready at that time is unacceptable. Will probably give their brunch another try but will definitely be calling ahead next time to check if they are actually open."}
{"text":"I've been to this place numerous times, so I hate to give it a bad review. Draught used to be my favorite brunch spot in Charlotte. After today's experience, it is no longer on the list. The kitchen was a disaster. Our cinnamon rolls came out really late and cold. The fruit on the mimosa bar wasn't replenished on a regular basis. Three people in our party didn't get their food until 5-10 minutes after everyone else got their food. One person it took a good 15-20 minutes. That meal was comped. She ordered the shrimp eggs Benedict, but was served 2 pieces of shrimp on a biscuit with a fried egg on top. Another omelet came out cold. Very disappointing experience. Not sure we will go back."}
{"text":"Are at Draught for the first time last night and was very impressed. My wife had the steak lettuce wraps that were fantastic.  I had both the pulled pork flatbread and wings.  Both were good but the wings were not hot at all and could use more spice.  Overall it's a great spot with good local offerings and great menu"}
{"text":"The good: Yelpers get 10% off of their bill for checking in. The fresh brewed ice tea is good. The bad: I requested well done wings and sweet potato fries. 5 minutes later I received wings that were white and bloody and lukewarm fries. The manager told me since they use bigger wings the veins are more prominent. She adjusted my check and offered a free appetizer and single serve bottle of champagne. I gave it to my friend since I don't live here and the likelihood of me being a repeat customer when I come back to visit is slim to none."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my sister on a Saturday around 11 and was pleasantly surprised when the chef came over and gave us samples of a new scone he was trying out. He was so nice and welcoming and the sample was delicious. They have great mimosa deals, $2 or $4 for a double. I got chicken and waffles, the waffles were panthers blue which was a nice touch and the fried chicken was probably the best I've had. It was a great experience in a cool location and I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"I was dying to come here because I sampled a short rib sandwich from a YELP event at the Underground.  It was so delicious that I couldn't wait to come back and bring people.  So we walk in and no one greets us.  We stand at the hostess station for a long time and a girl says \"do you need a table?\" We told her we did and while walking away says \"you can sit wherever\".  Um ok...so we sit down and she chats with coworkers and shows them her elbow that she hurt and talks and laughs and THEN comes to bring menus.  We ordered a beer, which took forever to come.  Then we ordered food, which took about 25 min on a non busy day.  I asked the waitress for ranch dressing which is an extra .50, and she seemed to have a hard time finding any.  It took until I was almost done with my food to bring the ranch.  She stood in the window arguing with the kitchen about who stocked the ranch and where it was for about 15 min.  She was very rude, the bartender was very rude and it was a huge disappointment.  The food was not as good as the sample I had.  The short ribs were very fatty.  It really made me sad.  I thought for sure if they made it a point to come to a YELP event and advertise, that they would make sure to be on the top of their game."}
{"text":"Sitting at bar waiting for an employee to at least acknowledge my presence. When I finally do get someone's attention his greeting was \"what do you want?\"  A menu would be nice. He hands me a beer list. So I order a beer considering the fact that he might be going someplace else to get me a food menu but the bartender never returns after giving me my beer. I catch the attention of someone else behind the bar who seems like a bar back and ask him for a food menu he looks at the bartender (same one  who vanished the fist time) and the bartender says sorry kitchen is closed it closed at 10. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!??? I've been sitting here for 10 minutes it's 10:03 mind you all I wanted was fries to drink with my beer!!!!."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  The french dip with duck was the best and the pork wings were great. Staff was amazing"}
{"text":"I wish I could review this place higher. I went for a home panthers game and had a lot of fun! It's one of the closest bars to the stadium and has a great atmosphere. I went recently for an away game and it was a different experience. We sat at the bar downstairs which wasn't super crowded and our bartender was pretty slow. She forgot our waters and looked inconvenienced every time we would ask for something. I also thought it was strange how they only serve brunch until 4 on Sundays. It's an odd combination. Either be a sports bar or brunch location but they don't do a good job of pulling off both. When I'm drinking beer and watching the game I want fries or a pretzel not an omelet or egg sandwich. The DJ was good and it does get pretty crowded which is fun. But just an odd place."}
{"text":"Went here for another soccer game. Had the mahi mahi tacos. They were spicy and delectable. I wish the pieces of mango were bigger, but I was certainly satisfied with this choice. 

My soccer loving friends were disappointed in the lack of intensity from the crowd and believed others were not true soccer fans, but here for happy hour and just supporting USA. Apparently in real soccer fan bars, people are obnoxious and you have to stand up most of the time. I'll take this level of enthusiasm as it seemed people were into it.... Just didn't know all of the soccer chants or give the game their undivided attention. 

Additionally, there were mule drink specials for $5 and they weren't stingy with the booze. The raspberry mule proved to be a great choice.

The parking here needs to be extended, as I was cursed out (called a b*tch and everything) over a space. Just lets you know how stressed she was over the parking situation."}
{"text":"At least the beer was good despite a relatively limited selection.

We arrived Friday night at 9:30ish and the place was half full. I would have expected no problems with service and food quality but I was mistaken.

Our waitress was barely present. When she was she barely listened to our request. She did however ask if we wanted to \"Tap out on those nachos\" AND if I was going to \"crush\" the rest of my taco.

The food was mediocre. The pulled pork on the nachos was cold and my duck tacos were flavorless.

I'm sure there are better options and I will be looking for them the next time I visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Chef makes new menu every week based on the fresh ingredients In stock. Amazing creative menu and great environment. I will be back"}
{"text":"I went for lunch today with a co worker. Waitress shared the specials and noted there was no pasta of the day today and they were out of the chef's special soup. No big deal. Didn't want them anyways. 

My coworker ordered the fried green tomato blt. Waitress said they were out of fried green tomatoes due to being in the process of switching over to a new menu. Weird, they're out of a lot of stuff it seems. Waitress gives us a few minute to rethink and reorder. 

She comes back and I order the Harvest salad. She tells me they are out of figs and pecans. #sideeye #wtf #whatexactlyDOyouhave?

Makes the restaurant look like a hot mess."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the last few months and it's always been good. My only issue is that the kitchen and service can be slow at times. It's a small place so they don't always have a lot of staff working which causes a delay sometimes when it gets busy. But other than that I would recommend it. The bar room is very cool looking and you can tell a lot of thought went into it, they have a really nice outside patio is well. Two of my favorite things there are, number one, the nachos. They are very different but are really good and worth a try. Also their brunch specials and Mamosa and bloody Mary bar is something to note! 

I need to update this because we went again on a Sunday for brunch and it was a disaster! All the food was wrong and came out at different times.  And the food that did come out was okay at best.  They need to get it together!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and I can summarize how I feel about it in two words: it's aiiiiiiiight. The first time, we shared wings and the pretzel. Both were decent. Not terrible. Not great. (For those keeping track, VBGB still has the best pretzel in Charlotte!)

Recently we were here for drinks and got hungry. I was craving Cracker Barrel (pancakes for the win!) but the ridiculous storm outside caused us to just stay at Draught. I got the Caesar melt (since they don't have wraps - boooooo!) with fries. Both were good but not great. My boyfriend got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and greens. I tasted his and was not a fan. 

In conclusion, this place isn't the worst. It also isn't the best. I would eat there again if I was already there but certainly wouldn't make a special trip there for anything."}
{"text":"This joint has a BANG'IN 5 Star menu that hits on all cylinders every time. They stole the head chef from some swanky uptown spot and he made this artwork of a menu and maintains it on a daily basis. If you want a magnificent meal or just a succulent snack (app) with a plethora of beers/drinks to choose from, I highly advise you to get you hungry, stylish ass into this front door here, it's the place to be on the Queen-Cityz South-side. Oh and as a bonus you can tell (Tara or Ryan who both rock) or anyone at the bar really, that the Guy Fieri look-a-like dude from the stadium enlightened you and there might just be something in it for ya.... ((BOOM!!))
~Stay hungry my friends"}
{"text":"I like the location, the decor, beer selection and parking availability. The food is decent but it's bar food so I don't get too upset that this is not fine dining. What's awful about this place is the service and the lack of general knowledge of how to serve customers. I attended a luncheon downstairs on March 9th. The person serving drinks acted like it was an inconvenience and while announcements were made she continually walked in and out while consistently slamming the door. When they ran out of salad at a buffet she told a person \"that's all you get\". He got his $15 back which was nice (I guess) but why even say that to someone? I then went upstairs at 1:15 to watch the ACC Tourney and sat at a high-top near the bar. Not once did a server come by. We repeatedly had to go to the bar for beer even though the bartender walked by us every few mins to check on other tables. It really was comical and showed us the poor service downstairs extended upstairs and wasn't just one person."}
{"text":"Great location. Poor service. Mediocre food. 

The beer selection is great, but the the business seems understaffed. The wait staff is friendly, but scarce. And they always seem to be closed for an event of unable to seat you because there is a reservation (that 8/10 times, you'll never see the reserved party by the time you leave)"}
{"text":"hidden gem. secret pathway by the panthers stadium connects to the third ward. good place to sit outside and bring the pup.

the food wasn't great though - can't recommend the duck pizza or nachos.

id like it better if there wasn't a clemson flag outside."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time. The service was lacking and my food was burnt. Moreover, two waitresses apologized to me and assured a manager would come speak with me and he never came.  Heed this warning and save your money!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday for brunch with a friend. The atmosphere was pretty cool. They had a DJ set up in the corner and he was playing a nice variety of music. We ordered mimosas. The waitress let us know about an option they gave you where u can get a whole bottle of champagne and you can make your own! The price of the bottle was 15. Or you could order mimosas for $4 a piece. It only made sense logically to get the bottle. That is a very popular option because we saw a lot of tables that had bottles as well. There was a table near the door with various fruit and juices to make the mimosa of your choice. It also has olives and tobasco sauces, etc so I'm pretty sure there was an option for creating your own bloody Mary's as well. The food was good. I got the shrimp and grits. My friend got the chicken and waffle. The shrimp and grits had sausage, peppers, onion and a garlic sauce. It was very tasty. I would consider it more of a lunch/dinner type meal. You also have the option to make reservations there. There were a few empty tables when we got there, but they were reserved so we had a small wait. I don't think our wait was more than 10 mins.  Overall good food, good drinks, good place!"}
{"text":"Strange location but one of the best bars inside 277. Ask for Ryan and relax. Order the hog wings, sample the amazing local beer options, and enjoy the sweater puppies and local blouse talent."}
{"text":"Visited Draught a few times and finally a review. Here we go:

First off, I've only come to Draught for brunch so my review is strictly brunch. They have a make your own mimosa bar with all the fixens. You basically purchase the bottle of champagne and make your drink from the bar fixens (I.e orange, cranberry, fruit, etc). I typically brunch with my friends every other week and we like the energy of Draught but their choice of champagne leaves much to be desired believe it's called Don \"something\" . Anyway their food is a bit bland (I.e Chicken Waffles, Shrimp/Grits). Both are presented/cooked well but could be seasoned more. 

I've been here a few times and each time it seems like their either under staffed or have their waitresses stretched between big and small tables which causes both tables to wait. 

Now the music is always great and the DJ plays a variety of music that keeps the scene live and vibrant.

Overall this is a great spot and I would recommend to anyone. We'll still come back but I tend to order beer only."}
{"text":"Oh Draught...I WANT to like you.  I really do.  But each time I give you another try I wonder why I went back...a place so confused by its identity that even the serving staff wears shirts with the phonetic spelling displayed across the front so patrons can get it right.

This place has the making of what would be a cool place to brunch, or grab drinks to watch the game but each time I'm left disappointed and feeling shortchanged.

A few weeks ago, some girlfriends and I decided to try this place for Sunday brunch.  I was the first to arrive and walked into an empty bar with a group of female servers surrounding the hostess stand, likely meeting before the shift began.  Not knowing they had not opened for business yet, I walk in expecting to be sat.  Instead, they all stared at me, whispering to each other when finally, perhaps the hostess, asked me what I was doing there.  I said I came for brunch and she then told me they were not open and to wait outside.  I obliged and went outside.  Being a nice day, we asked to sit on the patio once we were allowed to be sat.  We were guided to a soaking wet table/chairs so asked for a cloth to wipe them dry.  The server got a cloth from the bar and let us do it for ourselves.  Once we were finally sitting, the server brought us their limited gameday menu (I'm assuming this is their menu every Sunday in the fall) and it consisted of Nachos, Chicken Wings, and a few other items that don't sound too appetizing for brunch.  Based on the experience at that point, we ended up apologizing and leaving to go somewhere else.

I decided to try this place again this weekend to watch the Clemson Game.  The setup for the game was awesome- TVs and screens everywhere!  The service and food, however, was not.  Our server was very unfamiliar with what was behind the bar and on tap.  We ordered the wings- how can you mess up wings?  Personally, I'm a fan of crispy wings.  These were exactly the opposite.  The only way I can thing to describe them is they seemed like they were boiled and sauce was put on them still wet.  Not good.  Our table even joked that the sauce tasted better off our fingers than it did on the wings themselves.  The plus side- the blue cheese was really good."}
{"text":"Game day headquarters!

Love this spot on Panther game day! Everyone is so excited and having a blast! 

Located right outside the stadium, this is a perfect spot to pre game or go after the game. It has two levels, so even though it gets crowded, there is usually still plenty of room. You may not always get a table, but plenty of standing room. You will likely find yourself standing anyways because of the excitement. 

Sundays they do $12 bottles of Champagne on away games. They then put out juices to allow you to make your own mimosas. Best deal in town for sure. They also have Panther's shots that are bright blue and fun to take with friends.

Food is your typical bar food, but is quite good. We love the pretzel and the nachos are also good.

Always a solid spot to watch sports. We will be back."}
{"text":"Draught is my favorite place to grab drink and dinner on a weekday afternoon, weekend or right before a Knights game especially. Delicious food on the new menu, great drink specials and large draught beer selection. The burgers are always delicious and the pimiento cheese fritters are awesome. Also a fun place to watch a home Panthers game during the season!"}
{"text":"We had a large party and they were more than accommodating. The food was fantastic. The service was very attentive. Very LGBTQ friendly too! Will gladly be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Away from the city but close enough to walk if you live Uptown. Very friendly staff!!!! Great service and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been round the block  a few times, spent  30 of my 54 years  years in charlotte as a young professional hitting the bar scene once too many times in my younger days, I  finally came to the relaxing reality of I don't enjoy polluting myself like I used to now its  \"the lets go have a beer and relax mode\" typically with friends and family. I enjoy my beer I'm pretty simple when it come to what I like and what I don't like but I pride myself on know what beer should look like and taste like when I order it.
last night I went to this Establishment for a cold one and I asked the waiter for his Pilsners on tap he looked at me with a confused stare he had no clue what a pilsner by his look and said \"here is the beer menu\" he slid it in front of me it was hard to read for starters bc the fonts were tiny it was stained with some sort of brown mark on 1/3 rd of it, I said just ask the bartender to get me the Pilsner  you have on tap ...so he did and brought back some sort of fruity flavored beer obviously a random choice that was not a pilsner I can assure you. I reluctantly drank and and thought I'm out of here I told the waiter I was going to pay for the beer and I m off, I gae him a $20 bill and he said do you need change !!! I thought yeah, its a $20 bill
he took forever and gave me $13 back so $7 I paid for a fruity beer I didn't like and I still tipped him a dollar he was brazen and arrogant 
and if you don't know what type of beers you sell or the difference  either learn or get out of the business complete shambles ...never again."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best, and the service was worse. Hostess couldn't keep up, so people just sat themselves. Wings were disappointing. Even though I live in the neighborhood, I probably won't be back. Too bad!"}
{"text":"1st time visiting this place since they opened last year. I used to patron the old establishment (Hartigan) and for the most part the layout is the same... meaning this is not a big place.

I made an reservation on OpenTable for a party of 3, and were immediately sat when 2 of us showed up first. Waitress did not greet us for awhile, it was ok since we're waiting for the 3rd person to arrive, but that could be improved.

The menu itself is intriguing. They offer alot of duck dishes, which is great for someone who loves duck, but I find it to be an odd choice for others. Lucky for me, I love duck. I ordered the mushroom arugula flatbread as an app to share. My friends liked it, I find it a little standard - not much mushroom flavor, alot of sweetness from the glaze. Quite crusty and thick for a flatbread, but for $6 it is a good option.

I ordered the duck tacos  as my entree. It tasted a lot like the flatbread - sweet and with arugula. 3 good size tacos for $9. Not too strong of duck flavor for those who may not like a strong duck taste. Good for an entree, as it's alot for an appetizer even for 2 people to share.

My friends ordered the meatloaf and the shrimp & grits, and the shrimp & grits stole the show overall. Very flavorful and plentiful. If you are a fan of shrimp & grits, you should try this.

Overall I was happy with my dinner, granted not blown away by either the service or food. Will definitely come back and give it another try. Solid 3.5 stars..."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Draught and we were very impressed. It was a Monday so it was $3 drafts which was good. We got the Thai tuna and walnut blueberry salads which were not only good but were exciting choices that you don't see everywhere. The place itself was very laid back and relaxing and the outside seating was nice with a great view of the Charlotte skyline. They had a good selection of local beers which not every place has. My only issue is that when I asked for extra dressing for my salad I was charged $.50, and I think it is just tacky when place do that!"}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to enjoying this new sports bar that's the good part but, when I arrived although there were empty tables I was told a 2 hour wait due to they cater to Miami and another team for those groups only if your in that party? These were the only games on the tv's with so many other teams playing. I really wanted to try the place out as the decor looks awesome and really looked like a fun place but, felt like if you weren't a part of these two teams you weren't welcome. I get the commitment to certain teams but to feel as if your not welcome when there are open tables because that's a certain team spot did not make me want to come back. I really wanted this place to be awesome but I won't be wasting my time to come try again risking not being able to take part."}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions including brunch, lunch, just having drinks at the bar, and for a friends graduation celebration. Had a few order issues at brunch once & on another occasion my lemon pepper wings were way too salty but other than that every visit has been good and they fixed my issues promptly & were very nice. I do enjoy the brunch menu with the build your own mimosa bar. Prices are good as well as the atmosphere. Great place to watch all sports and have a drink on game days."}
{"text":"Great food and fun times at MSU games. But tonight a bouncer who said he needed to \"let the heat out\" by opening the front door, when it is freezing outside, causing everyone in the downstairs bar to be uncomfortable and miserable, was so incredibly rude and dismissive when multiple people complained. We all asked that the door be closed. He refused, saying people were complaining about the heat. Not true. No one, and we asked, complained about heat. The bar was a great temperature until the bouncer decided to prop the door open against everyone's wishes. We asked to speak to the manager and when the bouncer dismissed us again we met and spoke to his boss. This employee door shut for us. But it was so unnecessary to have to go through the annoyance and discomfort. Makes me reconsider ever coming back if the comfort of the patrons isn't a top priority."}
{"text":"They had me at 20 NC draft selections! Great rustic decor, friendly staff.

I was in town for work and found this place on Yelp. Just a few blocks from my hotel, so decided to give it a try. Solid nachos, and some other decent selections - not just straight from the freezer crap. I had the 'kitchen sink' meatloaf, which was great. Beef, pork and duck combined & served with garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens. 

Came back my second night and had the nachos, along with the duck tacos and some more great draft selections. There was free live music that night which was cool. Venue was spacious, clean, no complaints."}
{"text":"We returned to the Draught last night, which happened to be 50% off wine bottle Wednesdays, with a $30 Groupon for dinner. Our server was great, very friendly and attentive, she checked up on us at least 4 times during our dinner service and poured all our wine glasses. We went with a Red Blend from Chile, pretty good, I was kinda buzzed after the first glass. I ordered the shrimp and grits while the bf ordered a customized burger with a garlic mashed potato side. The food came our fairly quickly and smelled delicious. I have never had shrimp and grits before, but it was a Draught fav so what the hell, why not. I looked amazing though the grits had more of a solid mashed potato-y texture which I had never seen before. I am SO glad I went with this dish, the gravy was so spicy (earthy spice) and flavorful. This def has me hooked on shrimp and grits, why haven't I tried this before?!? The cheddar cheese grits were also great. Its just a wonderful dish all around. The bf said his burger was good, not Bad Daddy's good, but it worked out. 

I loved how we were able to use our Groupon on top of the 50% off wine bottles! What a great deal! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The location of this place is great! Close to Panther Stadium. We had the pork wings and regular fried chicken wings and they were both awesome. I enjoyed the food and location but for some reason just wasn't amazing for a 5/5. So I'd give it a 4/5!"}
{"text":"This place might become my new go to bar.  I went in for the first time since the remodel and was extremely impressed.  The whole place feels wry opened and bright and clean.  With the number of TVs they have all around the bar this is a great place to watch football. 

The service was great, our bartender knew the menu well and gave us some great recommendations.  We ordered pretzels to start and I got the chicken bacon cesar melt.  Food came out fast and it was delicious. I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I stopped in for brunch on a Sunday. It was a blast! They have a mimosa bar, live DJ, and patio (summer time). They are pet friendly as well. Come with your crew and hang out for an hour or 3!"}
{"text":"Feels like home! Great food, Great drinks & Great people!!

This place has become one of my favorite sports bars in town. It's close to the city, but not downtown. They have a ton of brand new tvs on every inch of the walls and are able to change the sound for the area you are seated in. I am a bit bias, as it houses the Michigan State Alumni Club of Charlotte - Go Green! They even have some Michigan brews on tap too. This place is also the official game watch for Clemson and Miami. 

Best Tip about this place: there is a back entrance on the lower side to the downstairs bar, plus it has a HUGE projector screen downstairs too!!"}
{"text":"We come all the time! Great pork nachos and salads. Unfortunately we like the nachos so much we don't step out of our box! The pretzels are also  awesome !"}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this place, as its the new 'home' of the Charlotte MSU Spartan's group.  We showed up early Saturday evening with friends and were asked by a bouncer if we were here for Michigan State.  He told us the MSU game watch was downstairs, but they would ONLY be showing that game there. Since our friends were interested in other games, the bouncer advised us to have a seat in the main dining room, as they were going to have a bunch of games on. 

We were greeted, promptly seated, and brought beers from their fairly large draft list. The interior was decorated in a cool way - kind of industrial, with lots of wooden beams. The waitress was nice, but quickly became busy - can't blame her; it was game day! 

Our plan was to stick around for some football, have some drinks and maybe get some food. That plan, however, was quickly derailed. After maybe about an hour, every TV was changed to  the Miami game. At first we thought it was a malfunction, because the picture quality was so terrible. In fact, we realized that they were actually streaming this game from someone's computer - you could even see a cursor hovering in the corner. 

We asked the waitress if she could get someone to change a couple of the TVs in the area to one of the other 6 games that were going on at the time. She agreed and hurried off, only to return with bad news. She advised us that the front half of the bar was designated for Miami and that the back half had other games on.... but there were no available seats in that area. To make matters worse, a group of rather obnoxious Miami fans were sat next to us. 

Part of the experience of going out for a football game is getting there early, staking out the best view in the house, and settling in for some beer and wings. What's the point of getting a table if they are going to change EVERY screen to a different game? Draught succeeded in alienating me and my friends. I can't rate them on their food, because we didn't want to stay to watch a poor feed of a came none of us were interested in. 

Better luck next time, Draught."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place for the food. Forgettable and pricey. I remember enjoying their fried green tomatoes. It's a great neighborhood bar with a half off wine bottle special on Wednesdays. Parking is easy. I've enjoyed their live music and would probably come more often but they don't advertise on their website, Twitter or Facebook. Strange. I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Draught, I really REALLY wanted to give you 5 stars. The location close to the stadium is excellent. I am a huge Panther fan and definitely will be back on game day.  I love the relaxed  and rustic decor of wood and metal. The have a garage door opening to the patio which I picture to be packed in the fall on Sundays. For what it's worth, we visited at 3:30 on the Sunday of Labor Day so I'm sure the D Squad was working serving detail. However, there was a total of 4 severs and 11 people including us. That's PEOPLE,  not tables.

We were seated and several severs walked past us without acknowledgement. Pet Peeve - just cuz you're not our server, would it be that hard to say that your server will be right with you? Anyway, we waited a good 8-10 minutes before she came by for our drink order.  I got the grilled flatbread with pulled pork.  Slightly sweet and crisp. I would order it again. Huz had the Tequila Shrimp Bowl full of large grilled shrimp, corn and rice. He said it was great and polished it off.  We waited another 10 minutes with empty drinks before our server came back.  Finally just got our check and left. 

All in all, a great new addition to the casual bar scene.  I will be back and update my review.   Hopefully they work out the service kinks soon."}
