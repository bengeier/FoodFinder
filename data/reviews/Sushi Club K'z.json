{"text":"this is the best sushi i've had in calgary so far.

i took a star off not for taste, but rather because it was pretty expensive. a lunch meal for two (including beers) came out to $110 CAN + tip. granted we were 2 big guys who ate way more than necessary, but still, i can't give this place a \"perfect\" rating unless everything is spot on.

definitely a good place to go on a date. we showed up at 12.30pm on a weekday, and the place was packed. we had to wait for 15 minutes before we were seated.  that's always a good sign. a few locals just ordered some of the food by phone and got it take - out. they got the delicious and fresh fish without waiting in the line. well played."}
{"text":"I've dined at Sushi Club a handful of times, and their quality is always consistent. It's a bit hidden in Kensington, but once you've found it, you'll be going back for more.

They have a lot of special rolls which are unique. I'd recommend the tuna tataki, which is a must have for my visits.

I'd definitely recommend making reservations, as it's usually busy, and sometimes they run out of dishes, and service can be a bit slow (but worth the wait)."}
{"text":"Tried the \"fresh today\" items - hamachi, coho salmon and sockeye salmon were awesome.  Pretty disappointed with the rolls.  The menu descriptions were promising, but the presentation and flavor were average.  If you want to try a superior crunchy spicy tuna roll, try the one at Sukiyaki House on 9th Ave - the difference is night and day."}
{"text":"Sushi Club has the best sushi in Calgary, no question. WOW.  Amazingly fresh and creative.
Have the Hamachi - it's the only place in Calgary that I will eat it. 
GO TO SUSHI CLUB but definitely make a reso."}
{"text":"We came across Sushi Club the other day and decided to try it yesturday.  Because they are located in Kensington, parking is a hazard.
The decor of Sushi Club is like El's Japanese Fusion but way bigger.  I really liked the decor of the restaurant.  The staff was really friendly and it was the first place since forever that greeted us with Japanese when we walked in.  The 2 chefs there were japanese but the hostess and the waitress were chinese.  It seems like a lot of regulars go there, the place is cozy and is a friendly environment.  But when they cook something, like deep fry or cook the unagi in the tiny stove, you'll smell like it too!! 
The menu has a variety to choose from, a lot of the stuff sounds pretty unique compared to the other restaurants.  Some of the sushi even have tar tar sauce in it!

After we ordered, the waitress told us, \"wow.. this is quite a bit..are you sure you want all sushi and not just sashimi?\"  We had to confirm with her 3-5 times that yes, this is how much we want.  This is the 3rd time that someone told us that we ordered..A LOT (first time at Towa, second at Green Olive and now at Sushi Club).  After she rang in our order, she told the people, \"be careful, they're either critics or they're going to eat and run\" XD...that's amazing...
Ok, what did we order.... APPETITZER - Ponzu Calamari The sauce is extremely sour, but when you dip the tentacles in the sauce, it brings out the taste of the tentacles.  The taste was good, BUT it was super crispy...I think they over-fried it...the darker ones were super crispy, but the lighter coloured ones were pretty good.  We were debating over the calamari or the baby octopus, but ended up getting the calamari instead...

Kensington Neighborhood Roll (special scallop, carelin roe, romanine lettuce, flying fish roe, avocado, tuna, salmon, prawn, sesame seeds)  I really liked this roll, the flavours were there.  The roes were poppin', love them love them love them!!  Anago (smoked sea eel), I prefer Unagi (ones under the Anago) waaaaay more thean Anago.  The feel of the Anago was rough, the taste is the same as Unagi tho.  Coho Salmon and Sockeye salmon.  oh my god, the sockeye was so soft, it melts in your mouth I like the Sockeye Salmon more the the Coho Salmon.  we had the special scallop and the cajun shrimp.  The red tuna was the freshest I've ever had in Calgary.  This melts in your mouth more than the sockeye salmon.  The tamago was unique cause the rice was INSIDE the tamage.  Special Tempera Roll (tempera shrimp, unagi, avocado, romaine lettuce, tartar sauce) It has a kick to it, but a little later, it has a slightly bitter after taste to it.  It's something unique, I've never heard of sushi with tar tar sauce before.

we had the Scallop Tempera Dynamite Roll (scallop tempera, avocado, flying fish roe, mayo, tartar sauce).  It's unique, but it's really nothing special.  the Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll (tuna, spicy sauce, cornflakes and cucumber).  The cornflakes put a crunch to it, which adds texture, the spicy sauce is pretty good.  As for the hand cone, it's the House Special (tuna, salmon, prawn, capelin roe, romaine lettuce, avocado, flying fish roe), the reason why we chose this cone instead of the other ones is because there's so many fishes in the cone.  everything blended really well together except the prawn.  The prawn tasted like it was boiled for a long long time, very stiff, I couldn't bite through it.

Overall, I really like the fish, super fresh.  I think Sushi Club might have the freshest fish in Calgary!  I would go back for the fish, but not so much for the sushi.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it doesn't taste good, it's just nothing special that makes me want to purposely go back for.  If you've never went, you should try it just for the uniqueness.  I don't think they have lite soy sauce because the soy sauce was super salty.  In the end, we paid around $120 + tax.  It may seem pretty pricey, but David and I, that's like an average price for us, but for those who doesn't eat as much as us, of course it'll be cheaper, so don't let the total scare you.

Price Wise (1 being cheap, 5 being expensive):  3/5
Food Quality (1 being not worth it, 5 being totally worth it): 3/5
Service Wise (1 being horrible, 5 being amazing): 4/5"}
{"text":"The first time we went to Sushi club, we love the food, the service was just ok.  We had two wait staff who asked us the same questions and tried to take our orders.  

The following week when a friend wanted to go for sushi we thought we go there again.  The food we got was still good, but we can't tell you much about the food we ordered.  We ordered scallops and got some kind of squid.  I'm not sure what it is but we ate it anyway because we were so hungry by the time it came.  So we ended up paying for both mystery dish and scallops.  

We ordered also ordered sashimi and got all sushi instead.  This is funny because I distinctly remember the waitress confirming that we are ordering sashimi.  Because we had waited so long for our food, and we had to be somewhere after dinner we decided not to send it back.  Sorry Sushi Club, I like your food.  However, I don't think I'll be back for a while because usually I'd like to eat what I order."}
{"text":"I selfishly do not want to write a review about this place, because it is SO good, I want to all for myself! 

Do not go to Sushi Club expecting a quick, average meal - take your time to enjoy the amazingly fresh fish that they offer. This traditional Japanese cuisine is the best we have found in the city, and we eat a lot of sushi! The fish here is always fresh, and the servers will recommend the best on the day that you're there. You get to choose your own little cup for warm sake, should you order it, which is a fun and friendly touch. The servers and chefs are very friendly, though always busy! The prices are very reasonable for very high quality ingredients. 

Visit on a Thursday - Saturday, and try to be early enough to order the Tuna Takaki - it is only available these days, and sells out VERY quickly! Sashimi is also a must, especially the Hamachi with sea salt on top - wonderful!

Reservations suggested."}
{"text":"well, this is one of my favorite sushi place in town. my friend used to work there and introduce this place to me. I know ppl complain about parking, but at night, you can actually park in the back parkade which is used by the offices during the day.

service is good. I'm Chinese so I could speak Chinese to order. but I'm not usually a fan of Chinese operated sushi places. so sushi club is perfect because the chefs are Japanese!!!

great variety of flavours unlike some other places which everything taste similar. I have went numerous times and the fish are fresh an kept at optimum temp everytime! 

all time personal favorite: Sunkissed roll! I won't tell you what it is, but you gotta try it for yourself! enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi place I've ever been to....a few years ago I had sushi in San Fran, Seattle and Vancouver...and the Sushi Club was better than all of them.

Their sunkissed roll is delicious, their 2 chefs are so rad and it's the best place to go by far.

And I've been to a lot of places in Calgary. Sumo (Eau Claire and Sunridge), Kinjo, Willow Park, GlobeFish (Marda Loop and Kensington), Hana, Towa, Sushi Boat, Sushi King, and 5 or 6 others."}
{"text":"What a pitty!
What a pitty when you have a great location and sushi but treat your customers like cr*p. 
\"No we don't have a table for 8. And no you can't even take 2 tables for 4 each cause you'll end up walking between them and making noise!!!\"
I'm definitely not going back. 
Pitty!"}
{"text":"Tried this lovely place last night, after Tenshi on 10th street was too busy. I am glad I got to try Sushi Club. 
As a vegan, my choices at a sushi restaurant are often limited. In fact, when one of my friends invited me out for sushi, the other who was with us was like, \"Uh... Sushi? Aren't you uh... you know. Well, there's fish in sushi.\"
However, Sushi Club had some pretty good veggie rolls with asparagus, avocado, cucumber, sprouts, mango, etc.. We also grabbed the typical cucumber avocado maki and drank lots of tea. Our friend got one of the combos, giving the chef free reign of what he served up, and apparently it was very good. The restaurant itself is pretty gorgeous, and I loooove the authentic Japanese pottery everywhere. EVEN THE GARBAGE CAN WALKING OUTSIDE LOOKS LIKE A GIGANTIC BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE POTTERY THING. 
Having had some pretty terrible sushi experiences in Calgary, where nightmares of stale, chewy nori have kept me up at night, Sushi Club has slightly redeemed the sushi experience for me. 
High five."}
{"text":"First time having Sushi in Calgary. We were recommended to go to Zen 8 and after a very hard time finding the place we opted to search via Tom-Tom. It got us to this wonderful little place Sushi Club. It was great. The crispy spicy tuna was out of this world. We ordered 2. california roll, fabulous. All in all the food was great service was terrific, friendly and the place ws clean!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi!!
Gotta love it.

Service was good and friendly.
Quality is excellent.
Nothing pretentious, just good sushi.
It's now on my Fav list for sushi.
Pricing was good too - when some places charge a premium for average, this place delivers premium at a regular joe price!!

If you are in Kensington and are looking for great sushi .... this is the place.
It'll be busy so plan ahead.
Plan to take your time too. Everything is prepared and delivered at a nice leisurely pace :-) 

Plain Old Awesome!"}
