{"text":"Came here for a late dinner. I got a noodle dish with minced pork. It was well-seasoned and had a mix of savory and sweet flavors. Their noodles were thick and had a wonderful texture. They also had a variety of drinks, but I didn't order one, though if I had come earlier in the day, I probably would have, since they looked pretty decent. The staff here are very friendly.

Definitely would come here again to try other items if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"Foods here are great and services are very pleasant.. must try there large size boba tea. Overall this restaurant is very recommended :)"}
{"text":"Before I got here, I was told that I would be amazed by the quality of food from this establishment. The restaurant fell short of my expectations. We were promptly seated and we each ordered a beverage. I got the chocolate bubble tea, and it was pretty good. However, the food service is a bit slow. While we received our appetizer (sweet potato fries, very good by the way), the rest of the main dishes came late and not all together. In fact, I was done eating my meal a long ahead of time before my friend got hers. I ordered the Japanese curry with fried pork filet. First off, the dish was slightly cold, the breading not flavorful, lack of seasoning on the curry, but the pork cooked just right. I doubled checked the breading by sampling my friend's fried chicken, but it was the same lackluster quality. All in all, I think this place may be great on a snack level (bubble tea + appetizer), but don't raise your expectations too high for the main course."}
{"text":"Overall speaking, i love this place . A great place for friends gathering and chatting. A little bit pricy compared to its counterparts, but the snacks here are delicious."}
{"text":"Somebody who reads my reviews might have noticed by now that I'm not partial to extremely fancy restaurants nor do I enjoy having lots of junk food. At the end of the day, a five star rating from me is not saying that the restaurant has gold-plated toilets, nor that they defeather the chicken in front of me before they braise it in virgin truffle oil. 

For me, 5 stars--perfection--is when I walk out of the restaurant completely satisfied with my meal and how much I paid.

NosThes fits the bill! Having grown up in China, I'm very picky about N.American Chinese food. It tends to be gross and have no correlation to real Chinese food. But NosThes is straight up solid Taiwanese! You could probably get a full meal out of a couple of their snack plates--I ended up ordering a couple because, my first time here, I had temptation to try everything on the menu. 

The dumplings are perfectly pan fried, the sausage is a little sweet, and the braised spicy beef tasted like home! For the amount of food we ordered, I feel like I got a great deal. Quality was spot on too.

This place just opened and there are a few kinks to work out (the tea service is a little contrived/expensive), but I imagine that as soon as Montrealers taste this Taiwanese excellence, they'll never want to return to Tiki-Ming hell."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for bubble tea and chinese noodles. Got the vanilla nut milk tea with tiny pearls and it was really delicious. Service was good. Will hang out at this place again!"}
{"text":"tried the yuzu tea and a latte and really not great, the yuzu tea was way too sweet and tasted like concentrated juice and not tea... we went there after a meal already, so didnt order any food, but only drinks, we just wanted to chill there. but the atmosphere wasnt so great and the waitress was so rude and impatient, and just didnt seem to want us there..:( it will never go back there again"}
{"text":"Food: The sweet potato fries are to my liking~ Do not order fried squid, waaaaaay too much dough and flavorless~ In addition, I find almost all the milk tea (except special flavors like lavender...) all taste the same~ Oo

Service: Did I mention how during lunch rush hour on Friday they have one staff attending al the tables? - -\""}
{"text":"Favourite bubble tea place. 
4 stars because sometimes the wait is so long ! Also the shop is really loud..."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal, decided to check out this Taiwanese place to get our Asian fix (we are from Toronto). Came here with my 2 asian buddies and one Latin dude who self invited himself to our little road trip. 

I usually get popcorn chicken back home, so I was looking forward to trying them here. I've never ate a cactus before, but this is probably what it's like. Wasn't hot upon arrival, dry, over cooked, and under seasoned. I started to question why we even came to Montreal and my head started to hurt a little, probably due to my mind being blown over how anyone can screw up popcorn chicken this badly. 

Also had the visar noodles. Friends got the beef brisket noodles, and the tonkatsu, which were on point, as were the drinks - they were good, but I didn't orgasm in my mouth.

It was a Saturday afternoon so it was pretty busy, as a result, service was slow and the food took a while. I could tell the two Chinese girls sitting at the table next to us were beginning to rage as they've been waiting for their food for some time. Now that I think about it, they didn't seem like they liked each other too much... Maybe there was some drama going on, who knows? Girls are complicated.

Anyway, being a group of guys, we didn't mind the wait too much, aside from the fact that we were STARVING AS F**K! But it was cool still. Making conversation and creeping on the other restaurant patrons distracted us from our bellies.

Returned the next day for take out drinks.

All in all, a good experience. After I find a therapist to hypnotize me into forgetting the popcorn chicken, I'll be sure to return for another meal!"}
{"text":"They sell pricey bubble teas and the food is average but I still go because of the taro bubble tea. It's exceptional. Once you get hooked you won't go back."}
{"text":"Service is impeccable. Our barista was so friendly and down to earth. In addition to providing honest menu recommendation, he happily shared his insight of Montreal culture with us. Between my friend and I, we ordered:
- Hot taro milk tea with tapioca
- Hot ginger tea with tapioca

While this was my first experience with with hot bubble tea, I've had my fair share of bubble tea in my lifetime. NosThes easily served THE freshest bubble tea I've ever tasted. The barista took his time steeping our tea (yes we oversaw the process as the other barista chatted up with us) and carefully crafted our beverages. The tapioca texture was on point; it had just the right amount of \"glutinous chew\" without that horrible \"stuck in my teeth\" feeling. What surprised us most was that no powder was involved during the making. It was apparent that the slightly higher price was worth every penny; the flavour actually tasted natural/real and our option of choosing less than 50% sugar brought out the natural flavours of fresh ginger/taro without being intrusive to the palette. I tasted real taro chunks and the hearty, graininess of the warm plant was truly something unexpected from this small joint in Gay Village.

We did not order any food there so can't comment on quality in that department. Definite must if you're a bubble tea fan or if you're seeking an alternative cafe experience from your old standby. I will definitely return if I travel to Montreal again!"}
{"text":"A really good place, iv'e been a few times, and there is so much options that I really can't decide what to eat only after 25 minutes. The ambiance has this warm feeling and although there is a lot of space, it is always somewhat calm. 

Sadly, there isn't much desert, which I kinda always look forward to in places like this.

Good for groups and pretty cheap too!"}
{"text":"I've tried bubble teas all across Canada, in all manner of restaurants from Vietnamese to Japanese to bizarre hybrid North American.  Perhaps it should come as no surprise that the very best bubble tea of them all comes from a tea shop and restaurant that is actually Taiwanese.  

Nos Thes takes tea seriously.  Upon opening the menu, you'll be confronted with pages upon pages of options, but unlike most places, these are not pages of options for various flavours of artificial sugar powders.  These are loose leaf teas from all over the world (most of which can be ordered hot, cold, as a latte, or as bubble tea), and the staff at Nos Thes brew them masterfully.  In three visits, I've sampled two of their house special teas as bubble teas (I heartily second their recommendation of their Assam), and one staff-suggested custom blend of Formosa Oolong and Kukicha with a mixture of regular-sized and tiny-sized bubbles.  All three blew away my high expectations.  Lots of nicely flavoured teas are available as well if you still want something strawberry or vanilla.  Forget fake flavours, though.  Check out Nos Thes.

(I can't leave this review without mentioning that Nos Thes also has a full menu with a wide range of Asian cuisine on it; I haven't tried it myself, however, so I'm unable to comment.)"}
{"text":"Their teas is very good. However, I find their dishes are a bit on the sweet side, their beef noodles soup is on the sweet side. The soup suppose to be salty. Even their Jia Jian Mein was on the sweet side. If they are a bit easier on sugar I'm sure it will be better. I will still go back for their teas."}
{"text":"Best Matcha Bubble Tea in Montreal~

Nos Thés is located right next to Concordia University downtown, and has a nice bright entrance with large windows. The people working the register are quick to take your order. While it is sometimes slow to wait for drinks, there's some room near the register to sit and wait. While I've only ever ordered bubble tea here, it's always been fantastic. The matcha tea lattes are delicious -- they always properly prepare the matcha."}
{"text":"The best bubble tea place in Montréal hands down. This is the only place I've been to in MTL that uses fresh ingredients for their drinks for around the same price as other bbt places (other bbt places uses powder). The food is authentic Taiwanese and comparable to the ones I've been to in Toronto and Vancouver. The vibe is also pretty awesome--it's a loft style with high ceilings, which is different from the other bbt places in MTL."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea. Try the taro, it's amazing with no chalky taste that many places have from the favoring powders."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my visit to Nos Thés. I always passed it thinking it was just a boring tea shop. 
The layout reminds a schools cafeteria. There's not much seats and its kind of all together but the place feels big and roomy due to its high ceilings. Service was impeccaple, the waitress was super nice. I got recommendations and tips on how their menu worked. Was afraid to order food due to the many negative reviews but was pleasantly surprised with everything I ordered.  I had korroke: two fried balls with mashed potatoes and veggies inside. I also had a seaweed salad and a large cold passionfruit green tea with tapioca bubbles. Soo delicious!"}
{"text":"I only go to this place for their drinks. I like their Mango Mania and a few others. The place is very popular already so if you're going during lunch time or other busy hours you should expect a line up even for the take out drinks. 

The food is very generic and pricy for what you're getting. There are a lot better option in the area.

Also in you're going in group and planning to enjoy drinks there beware of their Consumption is obligatory policy for dine in."}
{"text":"Very good! Love the bubbleteas! Natural and good flavors! The food is also very good including the service! The prices are quite expensive though..."}
{"text":"Came here on an evening where the restaurant was my second choice ..very unexpected..
Anyway , they have moved to this location a couple weeks ago , the restaurant used to be small that it was such a surprise to come down here in such a big space . Restaurant seems to be doing good thou , 3/4 packed , lots of people arriving or taking drinks for to go.

Regardless , I came here with a date for food as we were starving. Thereby , we didn't take any drinks --from my experience drink wise --it's not as bad as one would think. 

This review will focus on the food. We grabbed a Tonkatsu plate , a braise beef noodle soup and some sweet potatoes French fries.

Let's start with the Tonkatsu, rice had soya sauce added, but a bit too much . I think that was the problem, too much of everything concerning the seasonings. For example , my chicken had too much of sauce --it made the entire plate way too sweet. Even the most decent part of the plate the salad --had too much sweet sauce . Overall , the plate wasn't as great as I had expected. Although , it is sort of my fault as I took a Japanese plate inside a Taiwanese plate , maybe the food of their cuisine is better --who knows maybe another yelper could tell me about it.

The braise beef soup was average. Noodles are not homemade , and thereby , they come fresh from the frozen fridge. Beef was fresh and soft --not a bad quality of beef for the plate. I think it tasted just fine. Although, the soup of the plate was not too good , clearly there was a lack of flavour --as well as it didn't taste as spicy as it did . Think there was too much MSG , honestly I feel like that is how is tasted.

As for the sweet potatoes fries , they are great and long. They changed their sizings of the potatoes comparatively to their last location. They were seasoned appropriately although , I think there was a bit too much salt. The salad that comes with it could be refreshing for some, it's the same as in my Tonkatsu plate, I guess it could help yourself to not feel too bad after finishing all the fries by yourself! Overall , this appetizer was good.

So conclusion, restaurant is mediocre in terms of food , I guess it could be worth it if one wants to eat small things like appetizers and grab a drinks. However , I beg to differ in the scenario that one wants to try their meals as from my experience today , it really wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"They have good tea but their service is really slow , kitchen and bar are both slow. they really need to hire more people"}
{"text":"When I think of a bubble tea place in Montreal, I think of Nos Thes or Chatime. I would say that Nos Thes has amazing service and a great cantine style lounge to catch up with friends on a sunny afternoon. I love the bean bag chairs in the front of the store for a more lounge environment. 

The bubble tea is made from real tea and they have quite an extensive collection. I do find the teas quite sweet so make sure to halve the amount of sugar. The bubbles are a good texture and left in syrup so they also bring good flavour. 

The food is pretty average taiwanese. If you want authentic food, I would look elsewhere. Overall not too pricey but a good place to get a bite or bubble tea any time of the week."}
{"text":"Place was loud with lots of echo. We came for the bubble tea and was surprised with all the choices! The menu was wrinkled on a clipboard and portions were small. Everything was a bit pricey too. Overall taste of product was o.k. for the price."}
{"text":"This is my favourite bubble tea place in Montreal. The menu is great, they have a lot of options for tea flavours, and it's not the powder-y teas like other bubble tea places in Montreal. I normally like to get the honey oolong tea with bubbles. You can choose to get normal bubbles, popping bubbles or can even mix the two. Also less expensive than Cha-time."}
{"text":"I love the aesthetics of the cafe! I can only speak for the bubble tea, however the food and desserts look BOMB. I got the dark roasted oolong tea with boba and it was really good! The boba was soft and chewy. There was actually a tea taste (which I like) and the tea wasn't too sweet. Great place to satisfy your bubble tea cravings!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect going into this restaurant as this was my first experience with taiwanese food but man what a treat this was! They had a stacked list of teas to try hot cold or with boba. Our waiter was great and of course the best thing about the place...The food!! I ordered G05 on the menu which was the traditional taiwanese spicy beef noodle dish which was amazing (not like Vietnam pho because the broth is completely different). My mom got the taiwanese popcorn chicken and it was amazing too! Nothing like American popcorn chicken because I think they mince it first and spiced it very differently. 
Im so glad my mom spotted this gem because it was a great experience.  Everything we got was delightful and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Come here often for a bite and some milk tea"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Nos Thes. I get a different tea almost every time I go there and have never been disappointed.

I usually get one of the milk teas, with bubbles of course. I really like the Lavender Assam tea, it has the perfect combination of flavours for me. The taro bubble tea is good too, but less unique as you can get that almost anywhere else. Nos Thes really specializes in quality loose-leaf milk teas.

Don't discount the food either, it is authentic Taiwanese. Beware - the portions for some of the dishes are huge! I ordered the mushroom and vegetable soup and needed help to finish it! They're open quite late as well, so there really is no excuse not to go!"}
{"text":"I only went there twice for dinner, cos the appetizer and the dish are ordinary. Compared with their foods, the drink has my preference. But I have to say the service is great?The waitress was very patient to explain a lots and give the recommendation for me?This was my first time to left extra tips."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times now. 

The food was great and the portion was generous.  You will have to get used to waitresses's quirky attitudes.   It's just different. 

I will come back!"}
{"text":"Located around Guy Concordia, Nos Thés offers a variety of specialty teas and a few Taiwanese dishes. Well lit and spacious, it was great place for a rendez-vous.

 The Dark roasted Oolong Cold Milk Tea was really tasty - just remember to add sugar to their teas.

I would go back:
For a sit-down bubble tea date
To study with a friend
Nos Thés (at Guy Concordia) is best for:
Dates of 2 or groups up to 8 people (reserve if you are many!)
Its extensive drink options: with or without bubbles (different kinds), hot or cold, with or without sugar, etc.

{"text":"I lived 13 yr in Taiwan, and this place is absolute garbage.  I make better Taiwanese food than these idiots.  General tsao?  R u for real?  Everything we ordered was a salty or overly syrupy mess that make u thirsty as a fish dying on desert. The only thing remotely authentic are the processed fish products that you can just buy at a Chinese supermarket and you can probably cook it better than they did.  You can get bubble tea here, it's really typical affair, but skip the other crap.  Their menu is about as authentic Taiwanese as Tim Horton is authentic Canadian cuisine.  I've had better authentic Taiwanese food in a food court in Flushing, New York.  Lmao.

Go to Chinatown Montreal and visit the hole in the wall shop there.  They have real authentic Taiwanese cuisine."}
{"text":"This is a very good place for bubble teas and asian food (mostly japanese). I had the fried octopus balls (not takoyaki) and the Strawberry melon iced tea. The staff is very friendly. They answered very nicely to all my questions. The prices are also very decent. I really recommend it."}
{"text":"I visited Nos Thés for the first time on 6/28/16 around 1:30 with two friends. As it was lunchtime, it was fairly busy. A steady flow of customers utilized the take-out counter for drinks and a number of the tables were taken with customers. In regards to decor, it was cute and modern and I enjoyed the Jazz music playing while we dined. The place was clean and the service was excellent. I ordered the Vasir Noodles combo. It came with a soup, small salad (diakon and carrot), and iced tea. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The noodle dish was delicious! I forgot to ask what type of iced tea it was--it was so good, I would happily give up my daily coffee if I had access to it in my area. My friends and I remarked how tasty our meals and drinks were. I read a few reviews that remarked on the price. I don't feel it's pricey. My meal totaled $13.50, which I found reasonable for the size and add-ons. Overall, I loved it! It seems like a good 'hang-out' place with tasty food and drinks. I wish there was one in the States."}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly, knowledgeable staff. Delicious, good quality teas. Easily customizable (milk, soy, almond milk, level of sugar, large, small or mixed sized tapioca, different jellies, either hot or cold) large and varied selection - all very well priced. It is a spacious and lovely environment. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Definitely a cute bubble tea place! Within walking distance from Concordia and downtown in general , so definitely a hot spot for students. Stuff is relatively affordable, and proportions are pretty good. Has a nice atmosphere, complete with a second level. Their bubble teas are definitely a must try."}
{"text":"We have had tea in Taiwan,  the US,  and now in Montreal.  The tea quality here at Nos Thes is by far one of the best in any tea shops. We're so thrilled to have found them and will be visiting them everyday while in Montreal. In addition,  the food is authentic and yummy, and the staff and owners are very friendly and knowledgeable. You can't ask for a better location than this in the gay village."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for bubble tea. They have a huge selection of flavors, and you can even choose between different bubble types. 
I personally like my tea without ice, with mixed tapioca bubbles, and at half-sweet (the standard sweetness for bubble tea almost everywhere I have found too sweet). 

While this place is lovely to sit with friends, and they also serve full meals, I would not recommend it as a work or study place because the wifi is somewhat inconsistent."}
{"text":"too many options but are they actually tasty? just regular bubble tea. overpriced as well. ate the sweet potato fries which was a top favorite but it tasted like nothing. it's a good spot for you to chat with your friends but do not expect amazing food and drinks. the bathroom was okay."}
{"text":"The teas they make are still really quite good and flexible as you can customize the amount of ice and sugar (not to mention the large amount of teas available).

The food, however, has somewhat fallen short in terms of quality recently (some dishes are kind of mediocre)"}
{"text":"I've been a regular for 2 years and can say that their quality has gone super downhill lately. Bought a matcha soy today that I have consistently been buying throughout the year and it tasted completely off. They changed the milk and it ruined everything. Their sizes have gotten smaller and prices higher. Upsetting to spend money on something you thought was dependable and turned out for the worse."}
{"text":"This place is so good for their...tea. Yup it's called nos thés. They have so many kinds and you can customize it to your taste. During the summer, get the cold ones. During winter, get the hot one. It's always time for tea. 

What's also nice is that they have tiny bubble, which other places don't. So if you can't decide between the regular bubbles or tiny ones, well get the mix! :D 

As for the food, everything is so good. I always take the popcorn chicken or the chicken cutlet, but they also have awesome taiwanese noodles. 

Yeah, don't forget to try this place if you go downtown."}
{"text":"GAHH I wish this place existed when I was a student in Montreal!! Nestled right in the Concordia area, this Taiwanese cafe sits conveniently on the corner of st. mathieu and Lincoln. 

There were two women working the counter taking orders and making the drinks when I walked in. Since my friend and I had been walking around all day, we wanted to sit down at a table and order a snack. You can certainly order things to go though. 

I am Taiwanese and grew up drinking bubble tea. This place offers an incredibly wide selection of teas, mostly freshly made. There is a small selection of powdered flavors, but why would you choose that when you can get the real stuff? Like all tea/beverage stands or shops in Taiwan, you can adjust the sweetness and ice level to your liking. I had the passion fruit tea, half sugar, and less ice which was perfect. The tapioca pearls were also cooked perfectly. 

I can't comment on the food since we only ordered their Japanese croquettes which were perhaps a bit under seasoned but still good.  I would definitely order it again. If only I still lived in Montreal, I would definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"My friends and I just dropped by to have a study session here. Their new location is so much more spacious! Decor looks more simple, and clean which I like a lot more than their old place on St. Matthieu.  Crowd is not too bad in the afternoon- around half full. I do know that it gets packed late weekend nights though. 

I ordered an azuki matcha Latte here and also dark roasted oolong. As always they provide tiny and regular boba - but now they also provide transparent bobas in the mix. Very interesting. I think my favourite remains their oolong milk teas (the flavor is pretty rich). And you can control the amount of sugar you want in your tea. I think their quality of tea has remained consistent over the move. I say this because I was really skeptical at first because my azuki matcha latte was a little blander than usual in comparison to when I had it in their older location. But I realized I had ordered less sugar.

My friends tried the rose osmanthus milk tea and jasmine green milk tea. I really liked the jasmine green tea. Very rich. I was neutral with the rose tea because my friend ordered no sugar. I kind of like a bit of sugar in my teas . Of course there was a bit of a wait time because they are brewing tea bag by tea bag. But I suppose that our order came in faster than usual because the place isn't packed. 

Service here is usually quite good. Waitress are very attentive - and don't rush you like other places I've been to in other bubble tea cafes. Be warned, if you are here to surf the web - internet here is very unstable.  My only concern has always been the wait time. When it gets busy, I still have to wait around 10-15minutes. It's a drag if you are rushing."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic bubble tea cafe with a cozy atmosphere. Great service too! Friendly, helpful staff."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome bubble tea.

Final solution to the bubble tea problem in  MTL

Freshly made tapioca bubbles
Freshly made tea
Natural flavours for the most part

Decent food
Friendly staff
Takes interac
Free WiFi

Only complaint:

It's LOUD. I'm talking Peel Pub loud. So don't expect a laid-back atmo, not happening."}
{"text":"I've come to this place several times. Their drinks, especially the bubble teas are one of the best in Montreal, while their food is just average, but at least the service was good. However the experience I had this Thursday was disappointing. I came in at around 3:15pm and ordered a large sorbet tea and a matcha opera which is enough for  afternoon tea. And then I opened my laptop, charging my phone with my own laptop, while having the tea and the dessert. At 3:55, the waitress came and gave me the bill without me asking for it or finishing my drink, and asked how I would like to pay! I mean, I would totally understand it if the place was packed or a lot of people were waiting, but the truth was there were several empty tables around me! This is the first time I've ever experienced something like this, being \"chased out \" of a restaurant! How ridiculous! I liked the restaurant, but maybe not any more."}
{"text":"Got to the restaurant with husband at 7pm and was taken to a table right away. Food came really fast after ordering, though appetizers came after entree (don't expect this in Asian restaurants). 

Fresh taro milk tea with mix pearl was exceptional! I could taste the chunk of taros in the drink, unlike the powder taro milk tea I usually get. I ordered less ice and half sweet and it was perfect for my taste.

The yam fries was also very good! Sweet and salty snack to go with the fried chicken nugget, which wasn't the traditional Taiwanese chicken nugget since the crust was thicker. It's still good though!

Beef noodle soup and dried noodle with pork sauce were just as tasty! Good eat!"}
{"text":"AMAZING BUBBLE TEA! I've spent the last five months scouting Montreal for the best bubble tea, and Nos Thés is hands-down the winner. Great assortment of teas! The food is amazing, albeit a little pricey, but I just go for the killer appetizers and tea!

The only thing I want to note is that there are two different locations in Montreal and the atmosphere is very different depending on which place you go to. The Saint Catherine one near Beaudry metro is very sleek and stylish with padded booths and faux-grass walls and it is larger, so it tends to feel less crowded. 

On the other hand,  the Saint Mathieu location is basement-level and feels like a cozy, independent coffee/tea place with mis-matched decor and magazines in stacks for you to browse. It also gets pretty cramped when it's busy and doesn't seem to have as much staff as the Beaudry location. Either way, you get the same great menu, so you can't go wrong!

UPDATE 10/2014: Nos Thes on Saint Mathieu has now moved to a swanky new location next to Concordia on West Saint Catherine! Their new place is adorable and modern, but has the same delicious tea and food!"}
{"text":"I needed to check out Nos Thés as the ICU nurses from the floor always order take away from here regularly. I find it intriguing as I never knew you could order a bubble tea specific to type of milk, percentage of ice and sugar content-like a regular coffee! We came here around 10 pm and it was packed for a Friday night. The server was friendly. I ordered a regular sized chai latté bubble tea with milk, 30% sugar, half ice, and tapioca balls= perfection. If you get the largest size it was a difference of around 1.75$ - I don't like wasting good so I stuck to my regular size that was plenty. 
I guess I'm not a true bubble tea fanatic because I still prefer my fruity Cocobun powdered bubble tea at 3.50$!"}
{"text":"1. Flavors are pretty spot on 

I had the minced pork with rice and fried chicken

Star anise flavor a bit too strong in the chicken 

Minced pork has healthy modification vs it's traditional version while retaining the same delicious taste

2. Wait staff seems a little undermanned"}
{"text":"Food was ok but portion was small. 
Comparing with other places price was a bit high in my opinion. 
Busy hour expect for a line up

I like there honey green tea and popcorn chicken rice

Place was clean and well decor

Should give it a try if you pass by"}
{"text":"This may possibly be the only bubble tea place in the area. I got the wintermelon milk tea with mixed boba, 50% sugar. It was just perfect for me. I typically like to skip the boba but this place nailed it. I love the mixed option because u get the best of both worlds - tiny ones and large ones!! 

My friends got more herbal / fruity teas with the same sugar options and it def was more bland. I guess that's good for someone who is actually into tea and not the sugar lol. It prob took 15 minutes in line to order and another 15 to get our orders. I would come back if I visit Montreal again!

Now if we were to compare this boba place to any other joint in other cities, this place wouldn't come close in comparison at all."}
{"text":"This is possible the best milk tea I've had in my entire life. I'm so glad I got to try Nos Thés on my second to last day in Montreal because it meant I could return on my last day, too! 

We walked in and it was pretty crowded inside. One of the waitresses sat us at a table quickly and we had a few minutes to scan the immense menu. There is something for everyone here. Craving some Japanese food? They have that here! Noodles? Sure! Passion fruit milk tea?? I know, I too was skeptical at first. I love milk tea and I love passion fruit.... but together?? Magical. It was perfect. I didn't even need to add boba to make me happy. 

The passion fruit milk tea honestly didn't look any different than normal milk tea, which I didn't expect. I definitely want to try all the flavors they offer, because it seems like they use legit ingredients. You can also choose the sugar level and amount of ice, which I'm glad they ask about instead of making assumptions. This way your drink comes out perfect every time! 

I also ordered the popcorn chicken, which was ok. Not the best I ever had, but people come here for the drinks, not the food.... speaking of food though, my friend ordered the mushroom medley on rice and she was amazed. It was packed with mushrooms and smothered in delicious sauce that we will try to replicate soon. 

Our waitress was kind and patient. This place is great; highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, a perfect hangout spot for students and they even have the plushy chairs to sit on! service can get a little slow during weekends, an average of 10 minutes for takeout and 20 min for non takeout. The bubble tea is made using brewed tea and not artificial powder like many other so called bubble tea shops, for $5 you can get a large bubble tea that's quite filling and there are many options to choose from! the food isn't that great and actually made me sick at one point."}
{"text":"First night here after a long train ride - Oolong tea honey cremeux (80% sugar and less ice) hit the spot. It was soo good - I could really taste the tea and the honey; wish I got the larger size. Friendly and fast service. 

FYI - they seem to have a rule about having a seat at the tables - either minimum purchase or one order per person. We didn't stay, so we didn't have to follow this rule."}
{"text":"Yes, incredible taro bubble tea as Jane mentioned. There are actual pieces of taro in it - you might even want to skip the bubbles on this one. I always go for half-sweet. The place is big with lots of sit down tables and it's faster than it used to be. I did not have the chance to try the food at Nos Thés. Debit only."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and I was not disappointed! I only went there for a drink, but it was good enough to make me want to go back again :) the service was pretty fast considering that the place was almost full. And the drinks were amazing, I've never liked a bubble tea this much! I usually drink smoothies with bubbles but I got an actual flavored milk tea and it was so good. I tried my friends' drinks too and they were delicious too. Will be back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a bubble tea recently. Got a small lychee milk tea with mixed tapioca (small and big pearls) for $5.30. I liked it.

I've never had the option of small tapioca pearls before. I've had sago pearls, which are small, but these were like the regular tapioca pearls but smaller. It was cool and different for me.

I really liked the tapioca at this place. They were chewy, and not too hard nor too soft. The pearls were also sweetened, which I liked. 

The drink had a strong tea flavour and a strong lychee flavour which I also liked. I got 30% of the regular amount of sugar they normally put in and it was perfect for me. I don't like my drinks too sweet.

I got takeout and the staff serving me was nice and I didn't have to wait long for my drink. The place looks modern and clean. I would go back."}
{"text":"As a Taiwanese myself who also works in food/service industry, I used to drop by there quite often for their tea, it's a good choice if that's all you order and don't mind a bit of a queue. When it comes to food/service it's quite despicable. Once I ordered their croquets, by the time I took a bite, only to discover it was still frozen inside, 70% frozen. Another time I ordered some takeouts, turned out the meat was completely over fried, as in it was black, hard, inedible. I had to walk back to the restaurant and showed to the server who was very reluctant to have it remade even upon seeing the poor food quality. It'd be nice if they could strive to keep a more consistent quality with their cuisines as much as with their tea, and tend to customers' complains with more diligence."}
{"text":"I got a bad cold and waited for 40mins, then they told me they forgot my order. And then in 50mins, finally sth came, and it's the wrong one. I won't never be here again"}
{"text":"Situated where all the good japanese and korean restaurants are. A nice treat right after dinner Love the bbt here."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a taro bubble tea. The service was quick and the tapioca was pretty good, the tea itself however didn't have strong flavours and there we bits of taro in my drink which Really annoyed me."}
{"text":"It's so far the best bubble tea that I had in Montreal. Their tapiocas are fresh and taste amazingly good. I ordered two drinks  ; the milk tea with glass jelly and a taro bubble tea with tapioca. Both with regular amounts of sugar and ice. (you are free to choose) I also took the chicken katsu plate that comes with a mix of vegetables, a salad, a spring roll and rice. The chicken was really good but what I didn't like much was the soy sauce topping that really smelled like vinegar. If you don't mind the smell and taste of vinegar, it should be fine for you! I prefered my boyfriend's meal who ordered the taiwanese chicken leg that also comes with veggies, salad, rice and the spring roll. Overall, it was a great experience, the price was reasonable and the service was good. The waitress was really sweet and came to check up on us a couple times to make sure that everything was alright."}
{"text":"Okay they have good boba, but they also have a minimum order per person so you can share their large smoothies and teas here. The staff is fairly nice, although one time a waitress returned to get a totally undeserved tip from my friend who didn't feel like giving one... awkward. 
I think it's the best boba I've tried in the city and it has plenty of space, but the service can be improved."}
{"text":"I really like the bubble tea and mains here. I've had their popcorn chicken dish and taiwanese sausage dish. Both come with delicious salad. Oh and their sweet potato fries are really good as well, but be warned it tastes more like a dessert! 

I always order the same bubble tea flavor which is original milk tea, and I have sometimes been disappointed by some bubble tea joints. But Nos The makes it pretty well. I've had it with small bubbles and I think it's better than the normal bubbles!  

I would give Nos The a 5 , but my boyfriend's dishes were on and off, the ones he chose. And also service is very slow on certain days because I think they are understaffed.  I think they need to have 2 people behind the counter. Kitchen I think is okay because food comes fairly quickly once it's ordered. But when it comes to getting the order taken, it's too long. 

Try this place for bubble tea if you're in the downtown area (specifically near Guy metro), and hopefully you will be lucky that it's not a full house!"}
{"text":"Je n'y suis pas allez pour la cuisine, mais surtout car on m'avait parlé de leur bubble tea.

En effet on peut choisir la variété du thé, là où ailleurs il n'y a qu'un seul choix de thé. Il n'y a pas de poudre non plus, il demande si on le veut plus où moins sucré avec ou sans bubble. 

C'est définitivement un Bubble Tea sur mesure, et c'est ce que j'ai vraiment aimé.

En passant le design est vraiment classe, et la terrasse a l'air agreable (je suis resté à la clim à l'interieur)."}
{"text":"Good food and really great tea. The only reason it's a four is because there is a \"everyone buy something\" policy. I wasn't thirsty or hungry but if I wanted to stay with my friend I had to order something. The place is really nice and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The tea selection is amazingly extensive and the taste is just as good.

I made a visit to Montreal for the weekend and stumbled upon this place while exploring the neighborhood our hostel was at. I didn't visit Montreal for Asian food, but we were starving after a long train ride. I tried the beef noodle soup, which had short ribs in it. Not a fan of using short ribs in that particular dish, but other than that, it wasn't bad. 

I also ordered a honeybush four season milk tea and my friend got a plum & balsamic pearl milk tea (don't remember what it exactly was). I enjoyed mine and would frequent this place and try every flavor if I lived in Montreal.

The place itself is trendy with modern chic decor and slanted glasses.

Food would get 3 stars from me, but the milk tea makes it 5 stars because I like it that much."}
{"text":"Everything about Nos Thés is just so cute, from the cute setup to the cute mason jars the cold bubble teas come in. It's a great place to go if you're in a small group, since it has a nice cozy and relaxed ambiance. Their food is also really good! The only hiccup is that their service can be a bit slow at times."}
{"text":"Definitely a 4x place. I would come again this place. Mostly Thai food some Japanese. Like it!"}
{"text":"First time here.i tried the fresh mango manic...it was so good ,so fresh...but a bite expensive...large one cost 8$....I will come back for sure!they have a beautiful waitress too...."}
{"text":"Great teas, lattes, and appetizer.  Wow, really enjoyed my iced vanilla latte, fried calamari, sweet potato fries, and salad.  Beautiful presentation.\\see my pics =)"}
{"text":"Since they moved to a more prominent location and expanded the size of their restaurant/café, I'm almost certain they've increased their foot traffic by 10X more. I go there primarily for the bubble tea and a small snack. The friends that I've introduced to Nos Thés keep dragging me back there because they like it so much. Taiwanese comfort food is like most comfort foods, it just tastes good and and is satisfying. Portions are good and adding an entree about makes it a full meal that you don't need to go elsewhere for a snack.  The staff are pleasant and I've never had bad service, but the floor heading to bathrooms and towards the kitchen could afford to be cleaner."}
{"text":"The bubble tea is nice. However, the servers ALWAYS rush us to pay and leave. I get it, the place is crowded and they want to have space for other customers. But we ordered 3 plates of food and 2 large bubble teas for 2 customers and we were there for under 1 hour!! There are available tables next to us too and nobody was waiting in line to be seated. My brother still had his full cup of bubble tea and the server already asked him did he need to put it in a takeaway cup. This happened many times to me before too. Very bad service"}
{"text":"The description of this place when you do a search doesn't do it justice. In my opinion, this is more than a tea room. It has a very expansive menu with some great selections. I had a spice Vegetarian soup that was delicious. My cousins had dumplings and fried rice. We went on a Monday evening (Canadian Thanksgiving) and it was extremely busy. They take reservations and I would recommend making them. 
The atmosphere is very relaxed and casual. The crowd is mostly young. It is brightly lit and doesn't have any real 'ambience' but the food selection makes up for it. I don't believe they serve alcohol, but that's not a deal breaker for me. Hey have a vast selection of bubble teas and other teas.
Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup with vermacelli was delicious. Stopped in for a quick bite and the food came out fast and was awesome. Good date spot."}
{"text":"FINALLY. Bubble Tea that is made using real tea! I have had such a hard time finding real bubble tea in Montreal. This place delivers and to a high standard. Great range of flavors, topping and so delicious."}
{"text":"This is place kept rushing the customer out of the place for some reason. I had two instances of being asked to pay up early; i was sitting at the place for almost 50mins and the waitress went up to me and ask \"would you like to have your bubble tea for take away?\", i ordered a large bubble tea and i haven't even touched the thing, so unless she wants to rush me out of the place or she just wants to see someone chug the whole thing in 5 seconds. A few moments later, the waitress asked me: \"oh, it's not rushing but would you like have the bill separate or together?\", because i was with someone, and then she would bring the card machine to the table \"it's not rushing but here's the machine\". I checked to see if there were a lot of people in line waiting for a seat, but no one was there, except for the take outs. She probably saw the look on our faces when she was waiting for the receipt so she asked: \"was the anything wrong with the service today??\". No Sherlock, people would love to be rushed to finish their meal. Other similar places have never done this, to me at least, and they have roughly the same amount of customers coming in. I don't think i would come back here again thanks to the chocking i almost had when i was trying to chug the giant mug of bubble tea. Thanks Nos The."}
{"text":"I can't put 0. Asked me and my girlfriend to leave our table(take tea to go) because only my girlfriend was ordering. Is dirty inside and smelt funny to top that. Avoid !"}
{"text":"Nice looking, modern architecture, well -lit place. Waitress was very sweet, but the guys need to get it together. My companion and I both ordered the  wonton/seafood soup in chicken broth soup and tea. As I do not eat pork, which is what the wontons were, I asked the waitress to please hold the wontons & give them to my friend instead, and she was very happy to tell me she'd inform the cook. Our soups arrived, mine with 3 shrimp, 1 of which tasted mouldy and 1 scallop, in a greasy, but tasty broth. The bowl was SMALL and at $6.99 a bowl, that's STEEP! The teas arrived long after we finished our soups, and the waiter/tea person, wanted to know if we were ready to leave and pay, while we were still waiting for our teas! My friend also ordered a chocolate mousse, highly recommended by the waitress, which arrived FROZEN ROCK SOLID!  AFTER, my friend was halfway  chiseled   through her mousse, the waiter/tea person, noticed  her dilemma and quickly replaced it, (free, with apologies)  then placed her original in a microwave and brought it back! She ate 2 desserts for FREE! LOL  Our teas arrived not hot, as I like them Assam for me, Earl Grey for her, we had to ask for both milk and sugar, the sugar is a thick sugar syrup in a small bottle. I had no drip catcher on my infuser, had to place the infuser on top of my friend's , as she was given one. Again, there were apologies and a card given to us both for a freebie drink next time we go there, overall, since this place has been open for a few months now, the service should be up to par, not so sloppy. I might go back, but will steer clear of the overpriced soup, will try some of the mains, and if service is as sloppy as it was last night, will forego in future."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I will never come back again. The restaurant has good bubble tea, so my friends and I come here frequently. However, yesterday we have encountered a rude supervisor named Joseph who forced our friend to order though we already ate before and our friend didn't feel like to drink bubble tea. We r a group of 5 and 4 of us ordered a bubble tea each. After placed our order, the waitress told us the fifth person needs to order too according to the restaurant policy. Everyone needs to order to be able to sit in the restaurant. The supervisor named Joseph was super arrogant and said it is a written policy. Our friend should order or else he can't stay. First of all, we were at restaurant at 14:30, the place was half empty. Secondly, if the policy said so, you should just be clear to us from the start, and we would go to another place instead without leaving our friend to be humiliated this way. The fact that the restaurant took our order and then forced our friend to spend money when he didn't want to is unacceptable. Lastly, policy can be modified accordingly. In the end, we haven't given any tips due to the horrible experience and we wish this won't happen to anyone else. Too bad you lost 5 loyal costumers."}
{"text":"I can never go to Montreal and not stop by here for some yummy milk tea after lots of walking and shopping on St-Catherine St! The interiors have lots of natural light, and the drinks themselves are yummy and presented beautifully in a tall glass. I chose the rose milk tea this time, with less sugar and less ice, and it was perfect as a desserty drink while chatting and relaxing with friends. They have a list of top 10 flavours (see my review photos), and some of them are quite unique. Service is quick, and they give everyone a big glass of water as the milky teas tend to make you thirsty."}
{"text":"Cute little taiwanese restaurant filled with mostly students. The food is not super authentic (according to my taiwanese boyfriend) but its very good and I've never had any bad dishes. My go to is probably the taiwanese braised beef noodle - its such a big, filling and hearty bowl of noodles in a very flavourful broth.  

Nos Thes makes the best bubble tea in Montreal in my opinion and they are also the only ones that I've seen with the tiny bubbles. I usually go for the osmanthus or the rose milk tea with tiny bubbles and 0 or 30% sugar (I highly recommend to decrease the sugar in the drink seeing that they put so much sugar in it already and the bubbles are even soaked in sugar)."}
{"text":"One of the best bubble tea places in Montreal! Honestly you can really go wrong with any of the drinks. You can give the tea leaves a whiff before you order, and it's amazing how all the flavours are already infused in the tea. Tapioca texture is also on point. 
In terms of food, they have a pretty big menu of Taiwanese and other fusion foods. It's a bit on the pricy side, but it's expected for a restaurant in downtown Montreal. Their noodles lasted me two meals so I'm not complaining! I wanted to get a dessert as well but it was also too pricy imo.
The decor is trendy, but the atmosphere is a bit noisy and crowded. I think they just tried to pack in the tables a bit too much.
Service was also efficient and friendly. We asked the server for recommendations and he seemed really knowledgeable. We got the kind of drinks we had in mind.
5 stars for the bubble tea alone :D"}
{"text":"I refuse to go anywhere else for bubble tea.

Service is friendly and helpful. Ask if you can't decide which drink on their extensive list you wish to enjoy.

Where to start? 
Taro and mung bean are perennial favourites. They add fresh taro/mung bean in the drink to give it more taste and texture. Both taste great cold (no ice, please) or hot (brings out its sweetness)!

If you want something different, there's wintermelon, herbal jelly latte, moroccan mint iced tea, or even yuzu honey tea. 

You want the strong tea flavours? Do yourself a favour and try the oolong or assam tea.

Pearls come in large and small. Unsure? Try a mix of both! Ice/sugar level customizable, options in iced or warm in most of their offerings, soy/almond milk available!

Bonus: Hungry? They have a large menu. From deep-fried appetizers, to noodles and curries, to matcha opera cakes. 

But the real star is their tea quality. 

Place is modern and well-lit, high ceilings, wooden tables. Perfect for a catch-up date, group outing or solo work."}
{"text":"Chewy and delicious bobba. A very wide selection of unique tea blends. Ordered the creamy series but the tea was a little too weak for my preference and the drink was a little too thin. The drink was not as creamy as I thought! However it was surely refreshing!"}
{"text":"I love their selections of teas and they have such a variety. In fact, this was the first time I tried hot bubble tea and it was great. Excellent service! They were super informative, friendly and accommodating and after paying for our drinks, our waitress even said that we could stay longer if we wanted to. Definitely a cozy place to eat!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place this week when a friend invited me to go out for lunch to lament about the passing of Prince. I had already eaten, so I wasn't that hungry but I did get some snacks, and I did get possibly the best jasmine green tea I'd ever gotten at a restaurant. It was steeped to perfection (and you know how easy it is to over-steep green tea), and it was THE perfect temperature for drinking. At first, I was thinking that they were taking a whiiiiiiile to bring my tea to the table, but now I understand why! They simply wanted to bring me the perfect cup, ready to sip right away. 

Nos Thés has a *massive* selection of teas - their speciality is cold bubble teas of every possible mixture, but they will do any tea choice hot as well. I can imagine that mid-summer, this place is totally hopping. 
The meal choices are also plenty. I had a little plate of spring rolls, which were average. My friend had a curry dish which was soooooo much food (mainly a whole lot of rice), but she really enjoyed it, and she's come numerous times to this place, so obviously something good is happening! 

I really enjoyed the whole high-ceilinged, open, airy atmosphere of the interior. It's a breathable space, which I appreciate. Our servers were friendly and in control, which speaks of competence at what they do. I think I'll be back again when I'm slightly more famished, so that I can get a better sense of the quality of the food. Also, maybe I'll taste more of what I'm consuming when I'm not choking on the loss of a pop culture icon who marked my entry into adulthood!
It's amazing how these places of public food consumption become landmarks for big moments in our lives."}
{"text":"Bubble tea consists of a beverage with multiple flavors (w/ choice of cream or not), containing chewy tapioca pearls.  A popular Taiwanese delicacy.
Unlike cheap powdered bubble tea that you get at most places, this joint has it done the way it should be. Also nice place to hang out, study, good food, decent prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I come here weekly to get a milk tea.  The best in the city!  The teas are freshly brewed unlike most places serving bubble tea)."}
{"text":"I recommend the braised beef noodles. It comes in a huge bowl and the broth tastes like home (I'm not Taiwanese but my Taiwanese friend had the same description). Their drinks are okay but I've had better milk teas, especially the tea leaf flavoured ones. I'm also personally not a fan of the popcorn chicken, which has very thick breading. However I really like the noodles so I'll be back for that and maybe to try some other dishes! Staff was very friendly and there's never a long wait when I've been here so far."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food for the most part.  Their Taiwanese sausage was great, leaner meat with right amount of spice.  Salt and pepper chicken was soft not crunchy, not the style we love. Sweet potatoes were very unique; chicken legs were not flavorful.  We went in during the busy time; the service was on the slow side."}
{"text":"My friends said their tea is great, the food is just so-so."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get bubble tea in Montreal. They have more choices than anywhere I can think of. They also serve a lot of types of asian food but it doesn't stand out as much as the drinks."}
{"text":"Lovely place with great service.

I had the red bean paste milk tea and my hubby selected the classic oblong milk tea with jelly. Mine has red bean paste in it and it was a little too sweet for me, though I opted for 30% sugar. I also had the taro milk to go (with no sugar) and it was really good. You can taste the taro within in. Strong tea flavor in my hubby's milk tea which I love.
 
We received very nice service here and I will definitely come back for the drinks next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"There is such a huge selection of tea here, it's fantastic. I had never had taro tea, but was told it was a favorite. I understand why:) each tea the four of us shared was fantastic. The key is to not get the Westernized bubble tea where they use the powder. We didn't try the food, but maybe next time:)"}
{"text":"The only place to get boba drinks in the city.  So impressed that They use real taro in their drinks and not the artificial powdered chemical that 99% of other boba places use."}
{"text":"Five stars for their exceptionally good bubble tea. They have a great variety that you can choose from. We come here all the time for their bubble tea. 
Instead of having bubbles, try red beans instead!
Their food is so so, probably just three stars if solely base on food.
Best bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Nos thés is not only about tea but also about Asian food Taiwanese & Chinese. We tasted many dishes & it was tasty. The place is pretty well located on Ste Catherine street & close to Concordia university.  Lots of students & free WiFi.  We were a group of 6 & ordered over 8 plates except for one person,  they obliged that person to order or else she wasn't aloud to stay. I thought that was petty especially with the amount of orders we had!"}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun trying this place. The teas are the real thing and they mix it with sweet and ice. You choose the quantity of sugars you want in your drinks. My friends and I tried the snacks offered on the menu, the food tastes amazing! 

For the price and the location, it is quite affordable. My drinks probably cost 4,50$ or less."}
{"text":"Fantastic boba in every form.

Recently I had returned back from a trip to Taiwan and wanted to experience a different bubble tea shop other than my usual (Chatime just down the block). So Nos Thes has been on my bookmarked list for quite some time. The place was live and busy with students relaxing and looking like having a great evening of conversation, snacks and bubble tea. The tea here was fresh and so many different options. So I ordered two to go. One was a roasted milk tea, the second was passion fruit green tea. Both were ordered with less sugar and they were delish, fresh and exceeding my stringent boba expectations. 

If high quality bubble tea is to your needs this place is the real deal. It is prime location near Concordia I'm sure we'll though of to entice all the Asian students who love boba for a quick refreshment."}
{"text":"Great place to get bubble tea drink and Taiwanese food. The different between this place and other for the drink, they don't use powder for the flavor fruit like taro, mango your even passion fruit infused tea. Just awesome. The noodles are great, there are a few dishes that I wish they do well, like the popcorn chicken, too mushy and oily. Will try the rest of their items from the menu and updated you guys later. 
If you want to get good powder infused tea, the other place would be just fine. But if you want real stuff, come and check out this place"}
{"text":"this is a reatro very bad?I tried lot of milk tea at other place?any of them is better than here. the service is even worse.i will never come again."}
{"text":"Great vibe inside and super busy for both dine in and take out orders. The wintermelon tea with tapioca is your standard tea and you can choose various levels of sweetness customized to your liking. The tea tasted standard like honey with water and some tea but the tapioca was made very nicely. It was chewy like bubblegum, slightly slimy and sweet on the outside but not starchy.

Probably the first bubble tea place I have been to that has bean bags in the waiting area. Nice interior, great vibe, very lively and would come back"}
{"text":"the drinks are really good as long as u get half sugar, i accidentally forgot yesterday to mention half sugar so it was too sweet. other than that, its pretty good"}
{"text":"Nos Thés has a scrumptious variety of teas and food. Everything we tried here was well-priced and tasty, with unique touches on each dish (like roasted basil leaves with one of the chicken appetizers). Plus their salad dressing is addictive, and I can also now vouch for the scallion pancakes in particular. The servers were also super friendly!

We came back here a second time during our short trip to Montreal just to try more of the teas. The bubble teas include a huge variety of real flavors of tea (not just the choice of \"green\" or \"black\" tea at every other bubble tea place). We tried blueberry rooibos, strawberry sencha, kokeicha, and chocolate mint -- all really good. They also have fascinating-sounding alcoholic mixed drinks that featured different teas.

Also, they have almond milk as an option for their bubble teas! That's in addition to cow's and soy milk, so there are options for everyone. (Truly, so many points for having almond milk. Thanks guys!)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for bubble tea after being told that the prices are very reasonable for the size you get! Definitely the case. I was happy that I could make customizations on my order (sweetness, temperature, etc.). The bubbles were just the right texture and slightly sweetened, making them a great complement to the beverage.

I also tried some of the snacks. They were made in traditional Taiwanese style and although a little bit small in size for the prices, quite delicious.

Would go back again for the ambiance and drinks though I might pass on the food. Definitely not a bad place to spend a few hours catching up with friends!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and it was superb. It came in a large bowl and immediately I tasted the soup. The soup is done correctly with the right amount of beef flavour and it wasn't msg. Then I tried a bite of the beef and it was delicious. They provide you with enough beef slices to keep you full. I had beef slices that were both fatty and both lean, so it's luck of the draw I guess. There were also green onions and veggies in the soup which really enhanced the overall flavour of the soup. Highly recommend this dish. Note that they also allow you to add 1$ for extra noodles or $1 for hand made thick noodles. Next time if I was hungry I would add the extra money for more noodles. Mean came to $12 after tax."}
{"text":"I love milk teas that use real tea or can at least mimic the tea taste well and the oolong milk tea here does that! It's nothing mind blowing but definitely better than just an average milk tea. My friends got wintermelon tea and latte and both were really good as well"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ambiance here, especially the variety of jazz tunes played softly in the background.  I also highly recommend the chocolate peanut butter banana bubble tea.  Try the small tapioca pearls for an interesting variation!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite.
The beef iron skillet noodles were delicious.
I like how they include a small salad with the pot stickers.
Service was excellent."}
{"text":"A classic favourite for bubble tea and taiwanese cuisine. I love getting bubble tea at nos thes because the flavour is always consistent and non powdery. The meals are simple yet delicious, which is why we come back so often. The place is always packed and full of energy. It is one of our favourite places to go for lunch :)"}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for real bubble tea. They make bubble tea out of real tea and fruit sorbet, instead of nasty powdered flavors (they still have powder, so ask for sorbet bubble tea, always).

It is true that their food menu is not as good, but I go there for their bubble tea and special drinks!

They can customize your drinks to anything you want. They have a lot of choices too."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the portions are okay, but I was not impressed with the customer service. I understand that they are few, but they do not talk with each other. As a customer, it felt like the employees hated their jobs or that none of them like to communicate. It was like this for the both times I went there. Again, heads up for the food and the modeling of the place! It's a very cute place to go"}
{"text":"I went here before mostly for a place to sit and talk to my friends and various choices of teas never failed me. This time I went here a lunch. It was also great. 
I had a chicken popcorn rice lunch combo which came with salad and soup. The portion is huge and I barely finished it. The chicken popcorn is crispy outside and juicy inside. 
I also recommend their chicken rib. It's flavourful too.
For the drinks I always like the winter melon tea and rose milk tea. 
Love this place. So much happy chatting memories here."}
{"text":"Nos Thes has pretty good bubble tea. I like the fact you can sit down restaurant style have have a waiter instead of the fast food counter variety I'm used to. I enjoyed the small bubble tea I had, price tag was good. Tapioca texture was perfect. I also got some matcha cheesecake and it was quite average. Definitely would be back for some more tea but as a take-out option."}
{"text":"The boba there is a must try, but dont even bother with the food there. I always order a boba and go eat at other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Made me throw out my Starbucks coffee just to get in the store. 

Minimum order of 1 item per person to stay at the table with your friends"}
{"text":"There is no wonder why this place is always packed with people! Nos Thés is popular for their great variety of bubble teas, but they also have an extensive menu of Asian snack foods and entrées. 

I had ordered the chicken-katsu and really enjoyed it. Rice was sticky, chicken was crisp and tender, curry tasted like curry! While they are a Taiwanese resto, they nailed this Japanese classic. 

I can only vouch for their red bean tea, served hot, with bubbles. They let you decide the amount of sugar that goes in but their teas are best when sweet. My girlfriend really enjoyed her winter melon iced tea as well. 

For under $20 you are set with food and tea. A great place with friendly staff. Love them!"}
{"text":"This is one of the veeery few places in the city that serves milk/bubble tea made from real tea, if not the only one, and they're really good. 

I usually just go for the basic bubble tea or oolong milk tea (50% sweetness everytime, with tapioca) but when I'm in the mood for a refreshing drink, iced teas are the way to go. A personal favorite would be the Genmaicha iced tea (WARNING: AN ACQUIRED TASTE FOR MOST PEOPLE) because it tastes quite weird the first sip, but it gets better and better after that one. Plus, I just the flavor I get while chewing on tapioca while sipping on Genmaicha."}
{"text":"My Taiwanese friend introduced me to this place and now I wish it was closer to home so I could go every week... at least. I've always adored Taiwanese cuisine and this one is definitely a jewel among the plethora of Asian restaurants in the Concordia ghetto. I went there during very late in the afternoon, so it wasn't very busy and the food arrived in what seemed like less than 5 minutes. I had the fried chicken cutlet with rice, which may sound like something on a kids' menu, but it was sooo much more than a fried chicken cutlet with rice. First of all, the chicken breast meat is good in itself,no doubt having been marinated in some magical Taiwanese concoction. Then, it is wrapped in this rice krispy like batter and very nicely fried so that it's crunchy but not at all oily. The plate came with a giant serving of both fresh salad and pickled vegies, served with delicious dressing. The dressing could be a tad sweet for some people, but it's totally right up my alley. I had the time of my life dfinishing my meal. Drinks wise, I chose the honey green tea with tapioca bubbles. It's fantastic! The drink is a bit more expensive than those at other bubble tea pkaces, but no doubt it's because they use real tea leaves. Another plus!"}
{"text":"Nos thés seems to have changed their cook after they moved to the new location, the food they used to have was better, but the drinks has improved with time. The so-to-speak Taiwanese food is clearly not authentic, I don't particularly enjoy all the fried dishes they offer. Their bubble tea is still the biggest PRIDE, many choices of theirs are better than Chatime. I like their taro milktea a lot!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: we only orders the bubble teas. Staff was friendly and helpful, bubble tea was very tasty and quite authentic."}
{"text":"The service is incredibly too long during rush hours ! Come on !

Be ready to wait untill death to get your drink. They take your order quickly, but serve you right before you die. Smarts !

Clearly, they need more employees and have a better scientific management of the kitchen.

Otherwise the place is charming enough. The customisation and the choice of non alcoholic beverage is really impressive."}
{"text":"Avec mon amie nous nous sommes rendues à NosThés pour le goûter. Bonne nouvelle : nous avons bénéficié chacune d'une tasse de thé gratuite grâce à notre premier check-in sur Foursquare ! Pour faire notre sélection, le serveur nous a apporté sur demande des échantillons à sentir... qui ne sentaient pas grand chose, probablement que ces thés étaient exposés depuis bien trop longtemps. J'ai finalement opté pour le sencha fraise-melon qui m'a semblé correct, mais pas transcendant. En dessert, les \"petits buns frits\" et \"petites brioches frites\" se sont bien défendus par leur dressage et leur goût. Mais j'ai surtout adoré le choix de vaisselle à tendance moderne, design et pratique (génial le verre double paroi de Bodum, il m'en faut absolument un !)."}
{"text":"Not bad, though they can be a bit pricey. The portion sizes are decent, and the servers will try to upsell you (unless you're onto their game, or speak Chinese haha! Good try guys - I might be brown, but I've been around!) Having said that, their Taiwanese popcorn chicken is VERY heavy on the breeding (and it just doesn't have very good flavor - kinda confused flavor actually). The dumplings, soups, noodles were pretty standard, however their boba was pretty excellent. Wait times are a bit long tho, and to eat here, EVERYONE in the group MUST buy something or be asked to leave (they don't want Wifi moochers)"}
{"text":"Even though this place looks promising and the dishes look nice, my friend and me got sick after eating here.  I would never go here again, we would have been better off at Thai Express."}
{"text":"Nos Thes can be either amazing or just OK, depending on what you're coming for.

We ordered a few dishes for dinner: the popcorn chicken was interestingly spiced and breaded. Though it started out seeming like a wonderful alteration on the typical Taiwanese style, it got old a lot faster than I initially expected, as the mealiness of the breading got to me over time. The zha jiang noodles I had were neither spicy nor flavorful; just an overall disappointment.

Where this place shines is its tea. So many places make their bubble tea sickeningly sweet, but Nos Thes offers an extensive list of full-bodied teas that strike a balance with the boba instead of just matching its sugar content.

Come for the tea and skip the food."}
{"text":"Pretty place with pretty decor with pretty drinks with pretty chairs (yes the chairs are in plastic but still pretty). I come here ONLY and MAINLY, EXCLUSIVELY for bubble tea. Any season is bubble tea season. Tea tea tea drink tea. Add stuff everywhere! Tapioca pearls, lychee or mango or anything! Your choice! 

I usually take everything regular but no ice! Who needs ice??? Without ice, more tea to drink!

But the wait is long within rush hours."}
{"text":"Their lavender bubble tea is amazing along with the Taiwanese fries, but very pricey!"}
{"text":"AVOID FOOD.

Been here a couple times for drinks, but it was only recently that I tried food from their menu (don't do it).

Best bubble tea I've had in Montreal, comparable to certain bubble tea places in Toronto, but not as fantastic as the ones I've been forced (by my friends) to have in Taiwan (not a fan of milk and tapioca). They use real frozen fruits (for many drinks) and good tea instead of diluted tea and flavoured powder. I guess that's an explanation for the time takes to make a drink.

Food:
Average-priced, inauthentic, and dare I say, revolting. We tried 3 different items from the menu, and they all tasted terrible (2/5). It seems like the chefs don't know how to use a deep frier: fried food, as illustrated in my photos, were overcooked, dry, and tasteless. 

The 'zha jiang' noodles, suggested by our waiter, had a skewed taste. The recipe is simple and the ingredients are broadly accessible, so how they manage to screw it up is still a mystery today.

Would come back when I feel like getting my hands on a mango iced tea ehehe."}
{"text":"Exceptional Taiwanese cuisine, great tea, and a casual atmosphere. Need I say more?

The food: authentic, flavourful, fresh. The noodles: Homemade. The tea: loose leaf in many flavours from all around the world (Try Taiwanese red teas, they are amazing).

The atmosphere is friendly, sort of cafe like but welcoming. Their bubble tea is one of the best in town, not-from-powder(unless you want that). The dishes are fairly small, except the noodle ones. So it's best to order 3 for two people. Personally my favourite is the homestyle Taiwanese beef noodle!"}
{"text":"This place is very cute and cozy with good drinks such as bubble tea and other tea/coffee drink options. Came here twice during my trip, the first time just for bubble tea and it was great, but the wait was very long especially during dinner time. I think they are understaff, there were only three staffs, and only one person making the drinks (saw her making 7+ drinks at once). During our second visit, we went for late afternoon snack and drinks. The food was just ok to me. I might not go back for the food but i would go back for the drinks! 

Since we were traveling from outside of Canada, we didn't have local data, they were nice enough to provide us the Wi-Fi password when we asked for it. :)"}
{"text":"I paied a large milk tea and the tips, but they gave me a small one. I can't understand."}
{"text":"I planned a bubble tea date there with 4 of my friends. 

We got there without a reservation and the entire first floor was already full. Luckily, they had a lot of room on the second floor and that's where we were directed. 

Their menus are slightly decomposing, but I like to think of it as them being well loved. Some pages are torn and the edges are wearing off, but everything is clearly legible. 

There are SO MANY options! The waiter was really nice and helped me narrow down my decision. I ended up getting something with rose. 30% sugar. Sorry, I forgot the exact name!

My drink was the first to arrive and my friends' drinks arrived one by one after that. However, they ran out of tea! So one of my friends had to wait over 15min to get her order (grean tea with jasmine), which was unfortunate. 

The food there looks really good, but we didn't get anything, because we ate beforehand, not expecting such a wide selection. 

We stayed for a few hours, just talking and drinking out teas. The staff was very kind and we didn't feel rushed at all. 

It was a great experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"An unassuming place based on its logo making it seem like it's just an Asian-inspired cafe, we were pleasantly surprised by just how great the food, drinks and price were. Most importantly, we were very pleased with how knowledgeable, friendly and efficient the  Taiwanese young man serving us was, whom we're told is the only Taiwanese person at this Taiwanese restaurant. We ordered the lunch set, which came with a savoury miso soup, an asian cucumber salad and a cup of their refreshingly awesome green tea with orange zest. Our entrees were right on the money; we recommend the Vasir options, as the braised pork was perfectly braised and seasoned. We happen to live in South Korea and have been to Taiwan before as well, and we can gladly say the food was fantastically authentic. If you're looking for a true Taiwanese meal, this place does the job and does it well."}
{"text":"Among the best bubble spots I've been to within Ontario. Definitely worth a visit on a visit to montreal. The bubble tea actually tastes like tea, unlike most bubble tea stores. Read a lot about the service being poor but I didn't seem to get the same experience from my various visits. 

Their menu is larger than many bubble tea places, with many tea options that makes me want to go back to try. The food menu had the standard Taiwanese selections such as popcorn chicken and beef noodle soup but also included some Japanese dishes such as katsudon and japanese curry. 

I definitely recommend this place for a nice lunch during a day in montreal."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to their new location since they renovated and they definitely up'd their game. The space is really nice, lots of seating and I love the yellow they have with the wood. Their bubble tea is still as good and I love that you can get the tiny bubbles everyday now instead of just specific days like before. I have yet to try their food but they have good drinks. My favourite is the rose black tea with tiny bubbles!"}
{"text":"I ate there twice and my second experience was much better than my first.

What I ordered:
Honey oolong milk tea with tapioca 
Fresh taro milk tea no tapioca
Minced pork with rice
Popcorn chicken snack 
Scallion pancake no egg

1. The milk teas are extremely sweet so I'd definitely recommend you order them half sweet and add sweetner if you want it more sweet
2. Minced pork and rice is a classic Taiwanese dish. This was not fantastic but def not horrible. It comes with steamed broccoli which I found tone a bit random. Probably should come with pickled greens or other non-crunchy greens
3. Popcorn chicken- amazing! Order this! It's fried in a way where it was not greasy and so very tasty!!! It gets soggy if you bring it home so not worth the to-go baggy
4. Scallion pancake was good minus the sauce they poured on top- next time I'd ask for sauce on the side

Overall a positive experience! I'd def get the popcorn chicken and taro milk tea (half sweet) every visit!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Dropped in to pick up a passion fruit green tea with tapioca. It had fresh fruit in there. I was surprised. Didn't except that. But very good nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Confession: I'm addicted.
I was introduced to Nos Thes by a colleague a couple weeks ago and I've shamelessly been back like, four times now. It's bad how into these teas I am. Bubble tea, up until this point, has sat in my memory as \"that thing I drank at L2 when I was a teenager and I couldn't hang out in bars\". We're talking about an entirely different caliber of beverage at this establishment, especially comparing to the shady and sparse bubble tea establishments Montreal had to offer in the 2000s. Beyond the vast selection of teas, I really appreciate that you can select the exact sweetness level you'd like and the size of your bubbles. Oh and the staff is consistently lovely.

The snacks are also pretty good though, much like the teas, are a bit pricey for what you get.

Right now my fave is the vanilla nut milk tea but I'm also fond of the milky oolong."}
{"text":"wow even better tapioca than what I have in Toronto!! delicious and chewy, also not tasteless. 

I always order the handmade Taro hot milk tea (almond milk substituted), it took a while to make but it was super yummy. Even with NO sugar, it still tastes very sweet and creamy. When I'm back in Toronto, I crave this!! I love it.

The three mushroom rice and Zhajiangmian are only okay, not that great. But huge portions! The braised beef noodles are delicious though, not spicy. I prefer the Vasir noodles over Zha-Jiang noodles.

Service is excellent here. So five stars for perfect drinks and service! The food is so-so, Nos Thés is not my first choice if I am hungry."}
