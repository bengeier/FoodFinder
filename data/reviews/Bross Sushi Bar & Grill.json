{"text":"Good little restaurant. Friendly people working there and everything is fresh. Free hot or cold tea. Sushi selection is pretty good for such a small place. They do lots of takeaway, but we like sitting at the bar and eating. I hope it sticks around a while.  Only thing missing is a cold Asahi. Not licenced."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sushi I've tried so far in Calgary. However, I would say they are better for take-out. The place just feels super cramped, but their staff are extremely attentive and friendly so I guess that makes up for it. I would definitely go back to eat-in, or take out."}
{"text":"Small space, the food is great and the price is reasonable.
I enjoy eating there."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to Bross pretty much every weekend since they opened and have never had a bad meal. Lovely staff, authentic izikaya-style food (not like Globefish which calls itself izakaya but is just a bunch of mish-mash rolls) and good value. Yes it is small but not everywhere is going to be Moxie-size.  Reminiscent of places in Japan."}
{"text":"Some of the best quality sushi I've had -- locally and non-locally.

While there's not much room inside for dine-in (they have one small group-table and several seats up at the sushi bar) their primary business is catering and take-out. This doesn't mean that dining-in is a bad experience; their customer service is excellent and they're extremely friendly.

Their hours have expanded, too. I believe they're open until 8 pm most weeknights now."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went in for lunch at 12:00pm. We left at 2pm. TWO!!! It seemed to be just one young man waiting on people and we could hear someone in the back. You cannot run a restaurant with two people.

I also didn't understand the order in which people received their meals. I ordered a sushi bento box (miso soup, rice, two pieces of sushi, seaweed salad and two gyoza). The table who came 20 minutes after us got their bento box, udon soup and sushi before we saw even our miso soup... another table that arrived 30 minutes after us got their sushi before we saw food. Our soup finally came 40 minutes after we ordered (which took the guy 30 minutes to take our order). It was the tiniest bowl- probably about 2/3 cup? Miso soup is very cheap to make, no reason to be stingy about it.

My rice didn't come out with the bento box and when I asked for it, he didn't seem to understand me, but eventually brought it. Luckily I got it because the meal was not filling whatsoever. For 11.95 I expect to leave feeling satisfied, instead I left feeling glad there was a Tim Horton's nearby.

The restaurant itself is cute but definitely needs some paint repairs on the walls and it was freezing! I am always warm and I had to keep my jacket on the entire time.

I see no reason to go back, unless they improve the customer service, the portions, the wait time... yes the food quality was there, unfortunately there just wasn't enough food."}
{"text":"You know what? This place surprised us. New management apparently. The sushi was surprisingly fresh and inventive. Prices were reasonable for what we ordered, and the service (though the place was very quiet) was outstanding. Give it a try."}
{"text":"2 stars for the poor girl #3 in the kitchen, chef and #2 at war? No smiles, no speaking, no interaction with each other or customers. All this in a tiny 20? Person room??

#3 did her best.

Food extremely salty, average,there are other places more welcoming

{"text":"I was pretty hesitant to go to new sushi restaurant. This place was absolutely wonderful, it's a hidden gem! Staff was very friendly, and food was to die for. Miso soup, and tea was delicious. And the rolls were very delicious. Recommend it highly."}
{"text":"I got very minmal amounts for the two dinner specials. Totally not impressed. For $40 I'd expect a lot more, but essentially I got the same one chicken breast equivalent (but dark meat I think), 6 pieces of tempura and about 12 piece of sashimi on each box.

Definitely felt ripped off with the quantity of food presented to me.

Quality was average to slightly below average. The chicken had a charcoal taste (the taste when you don't clean the grill properly or at all). The red snapper was bitter (freezer burn?), salmon was ok, tuna had huge fish smell/taste to it. Tempura was averaged sized and ok and had decent variety.

Overall? I would not go back. Not worth my money unless something drastic occurs. I'd rather drive further to get better quality and more sushi."}
{"text":"Have been on a sushi kick lately. Remembered this little place opened just over a year ago in my neck of the woods and figured it was time to drop in. First thing that struck me is that there's not a lot of space. Only 1or 2 tables and then 6 or 7 seats at the sushi bar. Had the lunch special which came with a small salad, a choice of a hot dish (I chose teriyaki beef), and a sushi plate (tried my luck with California rolls and sashimi). Both the salad and teriyaki were tasty but the portions were ver small. The sushi rolls were decent although I have had better. There are better valued locations in the city but the taste was good enough for a second visit."}
{"text":"excellent sushi, very reasonable price,  large variety for such a small (teeny tiny) location. I love going every few months and trying something new, it seems that they are always adding to their menu. Heading there tonight for supper with my husband.

UPDATE: Just arrived home from another fabulous dinner at Bross, only to be saddened by the fact that monday is their last day :( . Masa will still be running his Mackenzie Town location (phew), while on the hunt for a new location for Bross. I hope he finds one soon, and as close to my house as this location. We will miss him and the rest of the Bross family in our neighbourhood."}
