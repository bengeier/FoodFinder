{"text":"Food is amazing! I have gotten it many times and every time I get my food fast and it is always tasty"}
{"text":"Tried this place out randomly for the first time tonight. I got an egg roll, wonton soup and General Tso's chicken (I was hangry, don't judge). When I picked up the food, it was hot. Not like it was sitting out for a while. 

I was too hungry to wait to get home so I ate the egg roll on the way home. Not greasy and so good. 

I was full by the time I was halfway done with the soup But still tried my chicken which comes with white rice. The general Tso's chicken was in the spicy option but it wasn't very spicy. Lots of food but I can never finish a meal so idk. Maybe it's average lol. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the portions were smaller than the other take out spot I usually go to. I'd order from them again but it's important to get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"Half an hour late and hair in my food.  What little of the Kung Pow I ate before going in the trash was without flavor and light on the chicken"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious! They always get delivery orders right and the food is still super hot. The restaurant itself is clean as well. I've never been unhappy eating here and everyone I've referred have loved it too!"}
{"text":"We ordered pretty late and it was more than we wanted to pay for 2 entrees but we decided since nothing else was open we would go for it. Took almost an hour and a half to get some bland ass chicken and rubbery beef. The container was mostly filled with rice and a tiny bit of meat anyways. Never again, even in the day time."}
{"text":"The best chinese food I have had in a very long time!!! Service is great as well, always friendly!"}
{"text":"The main reason I come back is the way the quality of their food. The honey walnut shrimp is the absolute best and I always substitute my rice for fried rice. The portions are large, so I always have left overs. I wouldn't recommend the Orange chicken, but everything else I love. With the larger portion size (compared to other Chinese restaurants), the price is very reasonable. I have never actually eaten here. I always get mine to go, but I wouldn't mind eating here. The cashier is nice and friendly, unlike other Chinese restaurants that are very rude and act like you're an annoyance. So overall best Chinese place that I've found since moving to Phoenix. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. They are very friendly, and food is prepared quickly. Portions are large, which is great if your on a budget as the meal will be enough for dinner and lunch. You can call in your order and pick it up, which is what I do. Only a few complaints: sometimes chicken isn't as tender as it could be soups should be complimentary for take out/delivery as well. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Some of the best General Tso's chicken in the valley. The lunch special was served on Styrofoam plates and plastic silverware which was a let down. But they are a primarily a takeout place so it makes since. 

Tasty. Cheap. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"At the time of this writing I am 6 months pregnant.  Full disclosure.

I was previously a huge fan of Golden Eggroll, and their food is still decent, but one day I was browsing through GrubHub and found Beijing Express.  We ordered your staples:

Sweet and sour chicken - FRESH!  The chicken is freshly fried and the sweet and sour sauce is delicious.

Beef or Chicken lo mein - my husband loves the noodles and says they are delicious. 

Egg rolls - Hot, flavorful, and they always add those little packets of spicy mustard that complement the egg rolls perfectly.

Egg Drop Soup - Just egg and broth and absolutely delicious!

Crab Angels - I know, this order is starting to be a little cliche, but these are my guilty pleasure.  Again, freshly fried and delicious.

They deliver quickly, the food is always piping hot, and the quality of their ingredients cannot be beat by any other delivery Chinese establishment I have tried in Tempe.  If I have to choose between Golden Eggroll and Beijing Express, I'm going Beijing all the way!"}
{"text":"After moving into our new apartment we decided to order something fast and easy. Beijing Express is right down the street from where we live, has great service via phone and they deliver very fast..I'm talking 15 minutes rather than the 45 minute count down I was given. The beef and broccoli, chicken and broccoli and shrimp fried rice is great, I have never seen fried rice packed with shrimp like this before!

We will be calling in another order soon!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this is one of the best Chinese take-out places in Tempe. I was lucky enough to hear about this place from a friend and now I spread the word as well!

The staff are really friendly and the heart behind it all is the young asian cashier who's really awesome.  Order by phone and the meal will be ready for pick up in 15 minutes! I've only ate my food once in restaurant but I would do it again because they gave me the wifi password and hot and sour soup as I waited. 

As for the food, I stay consistent with my selections. The fried dumplings (potstickers) are really good and plump with no skimping on the meat. The lo-mein and fried rice are essential dishes that are done well. The beef broccoli, honey walnut shrimp, Chinese eggplant with brown sauce are my favorite dishes that I recommend. 

All in all, if you live in Tempe this is the go-to Chinese spot."}
{"text":"Ordered and estimated delivery time was 60 minutes (which is crazy to begin with). Missed that time interval for delivery. Was trying to give them a chance, but never again. Egg Roll was great. Fried Rice was soggy/greasy and lacked flavor. The Beef Lo Mein lacked flavor. If you're near West Mesa, go with Tsing Tao, hands-down the best in this part of the valley. If you're in the PV area, go with Golden Wok. That place has been stellar for decades."}
{"text":"We have tried a few local Chinese places with not much luck but after receiving an ad on our door decided to give it a try. I was a little nervous as there were no online reviews at that time but we were pleasantly surprised. I had the moo goo guy pai which was really good and my fiancee had the orange chicken which was good but a little bland.  I ordered white rice but the accidentally put pork fried in with the meal but realizing the mistake also included a side if white rice. I did end up eating a bit of both rices which were both good....esp the pork fried. 
The crab angels where my favorite part....they are delish.  As beijing express is just down the riad from us I think this will be our new go to Chinese place as long as the quality stays the same."}
{"text":"Have ordered here for more than one occasion. Quick service, order is ready very quickly. Kung pao chicken was good but little overcooked for my taste. Rice is sometimes dry but that could be because I usually do takeout and it might get dry by the time I get home. 
THe egg drop soup is good and so is the cashew chicken."}
{"text":"I've had Beijing twice now... The first time it wasn't excellent, but it was just right for takeout Chinese. The second time? Maybe not so much.

Delivery after ordering off of GrubHub was prompt and on time, and the sweet and sour chicken was not bad at all, neither was the egg roll. However , the hot and sour soup was disturbing, slimy, and cold, and the 3 fried cracker things had a hair in them, a nice long one. The fried rice and lo mein were boring. I'm mostly wishing right now I could take back my order. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here often and they are quick but most of all the food always tastes great. Prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Good food but the prices are a little high.  Sesame  shrimp and sesame beef for the same price?  Either that's Kobe beef or crappy shrimp.  Also make sure to verify your order.  I ordered the shrimp but got the beef but since they were the same price I didn't raise a fuss.  The beef was good it just wasn't what I ordered.  And I'm not sure how you mistake shrimp and beef.  Side note...they'll tell you 45-60 minute wait, but if they're not busy it'll be there in 15.  Found out the hard way and thought I had time to run an errand while waiting.  Driver called from my house 10 mins after I left."}
{"text":"BUGS?! Ordered from here for lunch. They delivered within 45 minutes of the order being placed.  I got the fried dumplings, garlic chicken, and side of pork fried rice.  I was really only wanting the pork fried rice but there's a 15$ minimum for delivery.  About a third of the way in to eating my rice I discover a BUG. A FLY looking bug with like a stinger on the end. I am so disgusted by it that I Dont think I can eat the rest of the meal. 
I called Beijing Express and they said they'd refund me the rice, but I had to contact GrubHub because that's where I ordered off of.   I am currently talking to a GrubHub customer service rep to try and get my $$ back.  

All in all EWWWW"}
{"text":"Used to order here all the time. Never again!! Got the mongolian beef... literally no beef. I called them to see what they would do. They only offered a $2 discount on the next order. There wont be a next order ever again..."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food place around. Only one I go to. Delicious, generous, quick and affordable."}
{"text":"Lacks flavor.
Egg drop soup is the best item here, if that makes it simple enough to understand. Egg rolls were okay."}
{"text":"Best Chinese for miles. Delivery time is always good and the food is amazing. I love the beef and broccoli with extra beef and sauce lol."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fast delivery that's always hot and fresh. The portions are large enough to share. Love this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for almost a year and can't believe I haven't eaten at this restaurant. I had sweet and sour chicken with brown rice, and was extremely happy!!!! My boyfriend had their orange chicken and once again, impressed! Combo price is spot on. Their egg rolls are large, textured, and flavorful. We placed our order for take out and told pick up in 10 minutes. First time I've never felt miserable after eating Chinese food. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Order here for the first time based off what I read from previous reviews, was definitely not disappointed. I ordered the Dragon & Phoenix with crab angels and a spring roll. Everything was delicious. Would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"My husband is VERY picky about his Hot 'n Sour soup. He loved it. Lots of fresh mushrooms and no meat; needs just a tiny bit more vinegar. He actually said, \"I can't put it down!\" We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great amount of quality food for a great price. The lady who took our order went out of her way to call us back after they forgot part of our take-out order, superb customer service."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I have ever had. I would recommend steamed dumplings and the amazing chicken dish. Great delivery service and well priced."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese take out food I've ever had. Great food fast delivery."}
{"text":"Delicious! Possibly the best Chinese I've had in Arizona. We just ordered the Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet n Sour Chicken, and Fried Shrimp. All was fresh and tasty. I ordered through Grub Hub and the food was here within 30 minutes. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent/ good chinese place and i finally found it ! Everything here is delicious the only down side was the fried rice but i ordered pretty late im sure it is better when it is fresh. I've ordered here twice now and will continue going."}
{"text":"Lo mein, carb puffs, spring rolls, veggies, and brown rice are simply excellent & very fresh. Delivery always comes sooner than expected"}
{"text":"Tried delivery for the 1st time based on others reviews and I was very disappointed. Basically spent $30, threw it out. I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I trusted good reviews but I was not impressed :( we were looking forward to yummy food. 
Should have figured no from the start of the delivery boy not bringing change- thankfully between my hubby and I we had enough and little more for the tip but it decreased his tip amount (but I wasn't about to tip $12 on a $28 order).
The egg roll was just cabbage filled not much more to it. The angel crab ragoons were ok but slightly undercooked and didn't have much filling. 
Sad to say the egg drop soup was the best thing- it needed salt and didn't have much crunchy treats for it. 
My Hubbies chicken fried rice was bland and he only ate a few bites. 
My general tao's chicken wasn't good at all :( I ordered it medium but there was no spice to it at all- it was very sweet with lots of soggy breaking :("}
{"text":"Simply some of the best Chinese food I've ever had.  The entire meal was cooked to perfection and tasted absolutely delicious.  The speed at which they prepared it was also amazing.  Just wish we had one of these restaurants in SF Bay Area. Would absolutely be a huge hit."}
{"text":"Came here a week ago. When I walked in there were no other customers. Ordered the shrimp with vegetables and my friend ordered kung pao chicken. The food was fresh and came out quick. Staff was nice. The food though wasn't that great: my 6 pieces of shrimp were basic and over sauced and my friends chicken was dry. I guess I just expected better food but, the prices were reasonable. Wouldn't bother going back though."}
{"text":"Beijing express sounds like a good place to eat but its not all that. Service was great. We ordered chow mein fried rice, egg drop soup, veggie and chicken egg rolls. The egg drop soup and chow mein where really good. The rice didnt taste like anything and egg rolls where not that great."}
{"text":"A good restaurant. Deliver fast and food is really fresh and delicious. Recommend it"}
{"text":"Average run of the mill fast Chinese food. Can't go wrong with many of the dishes, but don't set expectations to high food is good, but doesn't leave you wanting."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good Chinese restaurant for lunch near my office. Saw several good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try. Ordered the Mongolian Beef lunch special and was pleasantly surprised. Very flavorful, tender meet. Loved the green peppers and onions too. The fried rice was ok, but it was pork fried rice and I prefer vegetable. Eggroll was good and all for only $5.50. I will be back again for this dish as well as to try others."}
{"text":"Finally, after living here almost 10 years, I found a great Chinese place.  
Ordered hot and sour soup (best I've had in AZ), and got the lunch special chicken lo-mein - it was all delicious.  I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great value and I've liked everything I've tried so far. Lemon chicken, Kung pao chicken, general tso, sesame chicken. This is going to be a favorite of mine at our new location."}
{"text":"Great food and a great price. They have a cute little location amongst other restaurants, but nothing to fancy. Their service was great and exceptionally quick! This made for a great lunch break meal. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Finally!!! Good Chinese in Tempe! It's so hard to be pleased with delivery Chinese food, but Beijing Express really delivers on yumminess! This is bad news for my diet! Great fried rice and lo mein!"}
{"text":"I was sick and ordered the wonton soup and some fried rice. It came quick and it made me feel so much better! Great soup and rice... I would order from here anytime."}
{"text":"We ordered Beijing Express for the first time tonight after reading others reviews.  I am happy to say it was very good with one exception.  We ordered the crab Angels, an egg roll, the orange and General tso chicken both with fried rice.  While the apps and chicken were all very good, and flavorful, our fried rice was very dry and pretty bland.  We will be coming back only trying white rice next time in hopes to have a perfect experience.  Pretty tasty food, thank you Beijing Express."}
{"text":"Wow!  Dare I say I've experience the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona.  The best! In my experience with Chinese restaurants in AZ is, the food is almost ALWAYS old.  They normally cook it earlier then throw it right into the fryer when you order. You can tell.  You can taste the old grease.  This is NOT the case with Beijing Express.  I dined in.  I ordered the Wonton Soup and the Sesame Chicken Combo.  Within minutes (probably less than 3). I was served my Wonton Soup.   It was pippin' hot and absolutely delicious.  My goodness!  I'm not sure what kind of crispy noodle chips things that comes with the Wonton Soup but that are so good.  I tried taking a few bites of the Sesame Chicken but it was too hot to handle :)

Once everything cooled off I took a few bites and fell in love.  It was so hot and fresh!  The portions were huge.  I had enough for lunch the next day.  While I was dining, a woman came in speaking the same language as the people working there. She ordered a lot of food, hugged the pregnant woman behind the counter and left.  That made me feel good.  I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how good this place is! We only order delivery from here and every time, it's been perfect! I like that when I order the Mongolian beef very spicy, it's actually spicy! The vegetables are not soggy, in fact crispy from being fresh! They give you SO many crab puffs! The price is super fair. I really enjoy their add of fried rice and add on lo mien noodles. I honestly can't complain about one thing and I can't believe this is delivery Chinese food! I never thought it would be possible to give 5 stars to a Chinese delivery place, you've proven me wrong. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Delicious, will definitely be my new go-to takeout spot. The chicken and broccoli was near perfect - soft but crispy broccoli with tender white meat chicken. My only qualm is that I requested extra sauce and didn't get any :( In fact, this is the least amount of sauce I've ever had in my food. Not even enough to cover the bottom of the container, let alone soak into any rice. I'm gonna chalk it up to a bad night and give it another go, because this is the most \"New York style\" Chinese I've been able to find since moving here."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery last night and the manager brought it himself. It arrived fairly quickly and the food was great!"}
{"text":"It took awhile to find a Chinese spot that reminded me of NY Chinese food, but I finally found it. As soon as I walked in I noticed two things, Chinese people were cooking the food, and the the place smelt like a good Chinese restaurant. This place instantly reminded me of back home. Great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Extremely reasonable! Living in Tempe had always been a struggle with no good Chinese food nearby. ...well not anymore! This place is awesome; and you have to try the walnut shrimp!"}
{"text":"Sorry for the few of you that had a bad experience with them but I was pretty impressed. First off, I've tried about 4 other Chinese delivery in the area and none of them were that great. So I kept trying new ones. We ordered online around 5:30 pm and they delivered within 15 min. 15 MINUTES! The food was packed perfectly and carefully and neatly. Egg rolls were perfectly fried and tasty, sweet and sour chicken was light and crispy, mixed veggies was a good variety and sauce was great, fried rice , steamed rice fluffy, egg drop soup good and hot and sour soup . I haven't liked the hot and sour soup at any of the other places I tried. Good job Bejing Express! You are my new go to for Chinese delivery!"}
{"text":"5 stars do not only apply to fancy restaurants, you can be a simple American Chinese fare establishment and be worthy of 5 stars as well!!  I ordered delivery from Beijing express from grub hub and the experience was a delight!  The nice gentleman showed up 40 min after I submitted my order with a friendly smile and had the food packaged very nicely and everything was correct! The food itself is also very good. Normally I become extremely tired and full from the smallest amount of this type of cuisine, but their food settle well and is also tasty.. The chicken broccoli and shrimp egg foo young is always my go to dish. Both are properly done to my liking. Soft but not overdone broccli and the egg foo young is meaty and not a thin over fried patty. The helping are generous and will easily last for another  2rounds. Fight!"}
{"text":"Great food, well-made and delicious. Take out was ready in about 20 minutes, I ordered a lot and they put it neatly in a box, which was really nice. This place is definitely my boyfriend and I's new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I love the orange chicken, and it comes with (unadvertised) broccoli, which is a great touch!  Service has been good every time I've come in for takeout -- highly recommended to fulfill your cravings in a little healthier way than, say, Panda Express."}
{"text":"One of the best chinese food i have tried in tempe, i came to it by accident once. It was a good discovery"}
{"text":"Went 1st time for lunch with my daughters, all of us really liked it!   Lunch combos about $6, fresh, flavorful & plenty.  Not the place for a real \"dining\" night, but great for very casual: ordered at counter, they brought to table. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We drove up and down this plaza and decided this is where we were going to have lunch. We arrived around 1:30 pm and there was no one dining in. 

The cashier quickly greeted us upon entering and she handed me over a menu and told us we could take a seat wherever. 

We looked over their lunch menu and everything was under $10. Any plate came with rice (fried rice, white rice, and brown rice) and a spring roll. 

We ended up ordering a large won ton soup, one plate of mognolian beef, one chicken teriyaki plate, and one shrimp with lobster sauce plate. Oh and three canned sodas for $1 each. My total came out to be close to $27. 

Our won ton soup came out right away and it was delicious! The broth was sooooo good! Our food came out right after and everything smelled and looked so yummy. 

The mognolian beef was a tad bit spicy (yumm) and it had such great flavor! The shrimp with lobster sauce was my favorite and it tasted even better along with the steamed white rice. The chicken teriyaki wasnt too sweet so it was delicious. Everything was very good!!! 

If your craving good Chinese food come here! We enjoyed it and will be back if in the area"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  My family and I ordered the honey chicken, Kung pao chicken(wasn't super spicy), pork dumplings (fried), and chicken with garlic sauce.  All of it was delicious.  The chicken was tender and abundant.  I loved that they came in plastic containers that were sealable as opposed to the styrofoam boxes. We got delivery and it arrived earlier then expected.  This will be my go to place for Chinese food from now on. Also, it cost $40 for all of it and had enough left over for another two meals for four of us."}
{"text":"Great little local Chinese restaurant. I called and asked if they had an online menu and they don't, but Rita graciously emailed me photos of the menu.  The food was fresh and tasty. I was told 45 min for delivery and they showed up within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. 
1st I like that they have coke products lol. There are no public restrooms but the dinning area was clean. The cashier had no knowledge of size of the items and really didn't answer any of our questions. They seemed a bit rude but I was ok with it because I figure it might be a language barrier. The star dish is the lo mien 
I had the house one and it was delicious, I would definitely make the trip just for that. The orange chicken was good too had a little bit to much tang but it was good. The only thing I didn't like was the fried rice, I felt as if it needed more flavor. 
Other than that it was good and since I work nearby I will be back"}
{"text":"Have ordered from here a few times and never disappointed.  Food is always good, a lot of it, and delivery time is always sooner that expected.  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service, and fast delivery. 

I placed my order around 2:00, and a driver was at my house before 2:30. The beef is excellent, as well as the lo mein!

Worth a shot if I had to recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for the price. Good quality food and friendly service. Delivery sometimes can take a while but it is well worth the wait. What I give them five stars of the delivery service wouldn't of taken so long to couple times. Potstickers are amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered based on Yelp reviews.  Best Chinese delivery we've had in this area!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the Tempe area my whole life and have been attempting to find worthwhile Chinese delivery the whole time - It has finally happened! The quality of the food is \"high\" and the delivery is \"speedy\". I generally order the house lo mien, however, everything I've ordered has been good, including the spare ribs. 

Beijing Express is my new \"go-to\" whenever I get a Chinese craving."}
{"text":"Last two orders they have cheaped out on the meats.  Ordered beef and broccoli only to open the container and see 95% broccoli and rest beef....seriously...   never ordering again."}
{"text":"Rude. I placed an order online thru Yelp. After 40 minutes I called just to check, he acted like I was the one who didn't speak English and kept asking me what my problem was when I clearly nicely asked about the order. Never ordering here again."}
{"text":"Def American Chinese food. Was pretty good. Egg rolls good. The dumplings were not. I will try some other dishes in future to see what is good. Would recommend asking for extra spicy if you want it spicy."}
{"text":"This is our go-to delivery place. Great egg rolls, good levels of spice, and they will customize anything. They also have a reasonable mix of sort of traditional and full on Americanized dishes. Recommend the mabo-tofu - so spicy, so good."}
{"text":"You can get pretty good deals during lunch. Any of their options for the lunch special that comes with rice, you can chose with any type of rice (either fried, brown or white) at no extra cost. I tried the Mongolian beef, which was really good. You can order to pick up, and it's really fast! Also, it's a good mount of food."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Chinese food for delivery. They are very fast, it's affordable, and it's delicious! I love the orange chicken and crab Angels! The people there are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"While the name of this restaurant is not exactly original - I did like my visit here. Main reason being that the lunch specials here are so aggressively priced it's very easy to come for a quick meal or order take-out. The lunch specials come with egg drop soup and wontons which were just okay but I did like the Cashew Chicken that I ordered. I'd like to try something different next time though if I make my way back here again. The service is just about non-existent but it doesn't really matter to be honest."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the best standard Chinese food spot in the Tempe/Phoenix area. The fried chicken is nice and crispy- none of that soggy stuff you tend to end up with at most Chinese food spots. The portions are very generous, especially if you are fortunate enough to grab the lunch special. I usually get the sweet and sour chicken with a large wonton soup, both excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I got a flyer from this place in the mail. I am a little bit picky so I did not know if I would try them or not.
But, out driving around on my way home, I saw it and decided to stop here.
First impressions. Very clean, Staff is helpful, not too high priced. Lots of choices.
We got our order to go. Ordered both items with brown rice. You have 3 choices, white rice, brown rice, or pork fried rice.
We got the Kung Pow Shrimp and the Beef and Broc. Both were good , although the rice could of been a little more cooked than it was.
We also got Crab puffs, very good price and not bad. They were honest as well and told us right away it was imataion crab.
I wanted to wash my hands while we waited, but there is no public restroom in the shop/ I always think that makes it tough for a restaraunt to be truly enjoyed.

Place is very clean and they even have cold water for you to drink while you wait for your order.
The deliver also with a $15.00 min. purchase. Which is not hard to do."}
{"text":"Large portions, fast delivery, and always tastes great. I order the Kung Pao beef almost religiously and have been extremely pleased each time. It's standard Americanized Chinese fare, so the menu is familiar if you've ever had Chinese before. I read some complaints about the minimum delivery charge and service, but I've never had poor service as it's merely delivery food so am unsure what folks are expecting in terms of service when it's just food being dropped at your door. Also, without a minimum fee people would abuse the takeout for small orders that would be counter productive to any revenue model. That said, it's fast and tasty Chinese food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Just like the east coast Chinese I am use to. Egg rolls are yummy. They actually know the difference between lo mein and chow mein"}
{"text":"I love Beijing Express! They are my go-to place for Chinese take-out. I usually order from them for delivery, but I have also picked up from their location. The inside is clean, the service is fast and friendly. The food is fresh, and flavorful, never overdone. They also cook your dishes to order, which I like. My favorite dishes are the shrimp foo young, and their plain crispy wings."}
{"text":"For Chinese food i put them into two categories.  One - I'm eating solo and want something to eat.  Two - I'm eating with my Asian friends and would not offer to go to any resturant in category One.  Bejing Express falls into category One.  This is not a bad thing, it just means I look at the food different and compare it to the tastes that may not know better.  

I had a delivery and it was really fast.  Food came hot and the order was correct. Now the important part the taste.  Overall it was good.  If I had a double order of noodles I would have happily devoured it with no regrets.  The other dish Mao po tofu was spicy and good.  It did have a different flavor then what I'm used to but that it never surprises me when it's outside my norm range. 
To me their food stilled retained an authentic type taste but there is a different taste in the more authentic resturants.  It's not something I can pin point exactly so this may not make sence to some people.  So let me put it this way.  I can eat the best potstickers in the valley and will enjoy every bite.  But compare that to good potstickers in Asia, that's where I want to eat more.  I plan on adding this place I to my rotation I enjoyed the food and service.

I would highly recommend stop going to that place with the panda and come here insread.  You get more options and the food is better.  I understand some people need their fix but why not get your fix with better tasting food."}
{"text":"Best steamed dumplings I have had. Lemon chicken is great and so is the Mongolian beef. Kung pao chicken was good but not our favorite. You absolutely must get the steamed dumplings!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I find myself continuously eating at this place. Nothing really compares to the surrounding ASU area. If your looking for quality and slightly clean chinese food, here it is. Give a five, if the younger lady who takes the order isn't always in a pissed off mood."}
{"text":"I love this place. I never had it delivered since I live walking distance to this place. 

Eating in is great. As soon as you order and seated, you are served Egg drop soup as you wait for your entree to be cooked. 

It never takes long for your food and it taste so great. Rita is very nice too."}
{"text":"Overall the food was ok.. the location is prime for customers. The food was good but in the Teriyaki chicken there was Mushrooms. And the meat was fried which was not expected.. I got the orange chicken which was ok fried small pieces of chicken. The Hubs got the chicken Fried Rice which he gives it a good thumbs up. I got Egg Drop Soup and that was ok it had a coppery flavor probably due to the water they may have used for it. Would I go back personally no."}
{"text":"This is incredible Chinese Food.  I have been an Arizona resident for 26 days and have had this delivered 3 times.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place for quick & easy! They have the BEST pancakes for mu shu dishes, and the portions are not at all lacking. The only issue is the food is on the overly salty side. But they have great good, a great price and delivery is always ahead of the estimated 1 hour wait."}
{"text":"Zero!!!! Don't ever ever order from here. I can't not believe the kind of treatment I've gotten. I'm appalled. They supposedly knocked on my door. I don't even think they got the delivery right. I'm on the second floor and no one ever knocked or called. I get a text message saying your food is by the door and I left it there. There was no food by any of the doors at my complex. On top of that when I texted back and asked why they just didn't call. They replied with F*** Y***. I called the restaurant only to have the person hang up on me. I called back twice. Answered the third time. Said I couldn't get a refund. They then said I can call Eat24 for a refund. I asked for a manager and they said there is no manager. Then they hung on me. I've never been treated this way. I'm also repeating this place to the BBB and Paypal because that's how I orders. Worst experience of my life after waiting an entire hour for food! Wow."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I ordered dinner for delivery and did not receive the crab angels. When I noticed this, I immediately called the store and the women asked me if I checked the bag. As if I was lying or blind. Then she said she would give me a credit. I'm from out of town, why would I need a credit for their error? She said they would be unable to refund my money. I highly recommend going to another restaurant. These people are VERY unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"Very upset. I ordered pick up yelp the chicken chow mein and when I got home I received a non noodle chicken and veggie dish with crispy noodle chips on the side. I called back very upset about my order. They told me that I was misinformed because their chow mein is \"New York style\" and does not contain noodles, but only crispy chips. Like wtf this is my meal?"}
{"text":"Incredibly fast service and I have loved everything I have tried here.  Try the homemade hot mustard, it is delicious. They are always friendly and put out good food. Try the crab puffs"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese delivery in Tempe (and possibly all of AZ). Have ordered from here dozens of times now and have zero complaints. The food is great and the delivery is fast!"}
{"text":"Great service, very quick delivery, usually ahead of time expected. Food is decent. Not bad but not remarkable. Tried about 4 times with different selections. Not a huge fan but if lazy on a weekend at home would still call for prompt delivery service."}
{"text":"I probably would have liked it, but after two hours and repeated phone calls and assurances that my food was on its way, my food never arrived ."}
{"text":"Nice people! Fast, good. Facilities are clean. It's in a cute little plaza. Have ordered twice, both positive experiences."}
{"text":"I have finally found a good Chinese restaurant nearby.  I've ordered from here twice, and both times, we have been pleasantly surprised.  No super greasy, overcooked food that tastes like oil and salt.  The dishes have a ton of flavor and perfectly cooked. 

The first time, my partner and I shared broccoli beef and cashew chicken with an order of pot-stickers.  Even after being in the take-out box, the broccoli was crisp and green.  We both thought the dumplings were hand-made and he loved them. The leftovers lasted us two more meals. 

Last night, my friend and I ordered takeout. We shared the kung pao chicken, an order of crab angels, and egg drop soup.  Great prices, and again, still leftovers! My only complaint is that there wasn't more filling in the crab angels. 
 
Great food for a good value."}
{"text":"After getting disappointed from my old Chinese take out spot, I ended up trying Beijing Express. They get their orders out really quickly and their food has always been great. At this point, I'm pretty sure they know my orders if they saw my face. The only dish I didn't like from them was their General Tso's chicken. The sauce was basically just sweet chili sauce. That's the only issue I have with them."}
{"text":"Got the general tso's spicy chicken and an egg roll. The chicken was drake meat nuggets deep fried that had poor tasting sauce drizzled over it. The dish was not spicy at all. There were no vegetables mixed in with the chicken, which some pictures showed. Mediocre deep fried food... if that's what your in the mood for then go ahead."}
{"text":"This seems like a mostly take out place. The dishes we had (eggplant with tofu) and the thin noodles were decent but lacked any wow. The noodles could have use more vegetables and the eggplant sauce with a bit too thick and sweet for my tastes.

A few more veg options with more flavor would be appreciated, as would a cooler eating area and a bathroom not inside the kitchen."}
{"text":"I pass this place on my way home from work and decided to try it, after reading reviews on Yelp naturally. Took it to go. I can't tell you how many places I've tried to find what I think of as good egg foo young and egg rolls. I'm originally from the Midwest and the Chinese food is done differently back there. I have to say this is the best egg foo young and egg rolls I've had since moving to AZ.  We also had fried shrimp, beef in garlic sauce and beef lo mein. All of which my husband loved. Beef fried rice was a little dry.  Other then that we were very pleased.  The staff was very pleasant. Will definitely go back. Also we got a free lite of soda with our order."}
{"text":"In the area for a conference and stopped in because of the great lunch price.  Food and service was great.  I got the orange chicken, but could have used a little more orange peel flavor.  Texture of food was perfect and egg roll was delish!!!  Would go again if in the area."}
{"text":"Great food. Found them about 3 months ago and I've ordered delivery 4 times since."}
{"text":"I accidentally gave them my work address instead of my home address. (One mile difference in location.) I felt ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I had intentions of apologizing and providing a $10 tip. I hadn't tipped on my card in advance, planned on using cash or adjusting when we signed the receipt.. (I never do tip in advance, after once tipping $7 for a pizza that was a 45 min late.) Again, this was a complete accident and I felt horrible for my mistake. But when the driver showed up he was so angry, he shoved the food at my boyfriend, and walked away while he was trying to apologize. 

The food was great. But I'll never order from here again. Which I'm sure is fine with them. They don't seem to want my business because of an honest mistake. My freaking bad!! I tried to make it right and they didn't give a shit.

I can understand that this was frustrating. But you shouldn't be rude to paying customers. Even if they screwed up. You have no idea how bad I felt, or what my intentions were."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! So Good. A little pricey, but the ingredients are high quality, not the questionable kind a lot of Chinese Restaurants pass off as Beef or Chicken. Delivery was super fast!  Food was still hot when it arrived and that included the fried items I ordered, as most fried foods don't make it. I wish they would have included a menu with the delivery as I will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Lunch special is extremely cheap, and you get a great amount of food for the price! Service was great and fast. The food itself wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either, standard Chinese takeout - nothing that really stuck out. The service and price are really what pushed this from a 3 to a 4. I would recommend it if you want a quick bite on the cheap!"}
{"text":"I had the Mongolian beef (a little over $9 with tax), listed as spicy, but it wasn't. The veggies (red bell pepper, onions, a few shreds of carrots) were fresh and not over cooked. The beef was not as tender as some of my prior encounters with this dish and slightly larger than bite sized pieces (yet no knife to cut the meat was provided). The brown rice was slightly dry and not seasoned. The sauce was a brown thin gravy type sauce. The portion was large and included the obligatory fortune cookie. The meal did not include any soup nor crab puff nor egg roll (I ate in, this was not a to-go order). 

This appears to be a family business. The young man taking my order smiled and was friendly. The facility was clean and the tables and chairs were clean. There was only one other customer in the restaurant and only one take out order while I was there. It was quite warm and there was a portable air conditioner a few feet away from me, but it was still warmer than comfortable.There is ample parking close to the door. I would categorize this business as an average Americanized Chinese food establishment."}
{"text":"Average greasy Chinese food.  The menu is standard fair with the normal entrees you would expect. I've gone several times since I work close by and service is friendly and quick. For $5.50 the lunch specials are a great deal."}
{"text":"We took a chance and ordered from Beijing Express and I am glad we did.  We had our food delivered and got it in less than 40 minutes.  I had the Szechuan Beef and my husband has the Dragon and Phoenix and fried dumplings.  It was all very delicious and hot.  The only downside was we wanted spicy and it appeared to be quite mild, but still very good.  I would definitely recommend Beijing Express when you are craving takeout."}
{"text":"Best \"HOUSE\" Won Ton Soup in town

I have eaten here at least 100 times if not more. (I live close by) but either way, some of the food here is pretty good . The restaurant is clean, but not air conditioned, so delivery is best. Customer service is okay as long as you don t need to communicate anything too complex. Keep it strictly  to ordering menu items and drinks and you'll be good.  These folks are straight from the old country, and their English, or lack there of, definitely shows this to be true. Overall the food is pretty good except for , ironically, the  3 main staples of Oriental cuisine --Teriyaki Chicken,  Fried Rice & Egg Rolls.  These are some of the worst I have had anywhere.  So,  if these are what you had your heart set on, Jack in the Box does it better. (I love Jack in the Box Egg Rolls...to die for) 

Now there are some things that I order ALL THE TIME 
that DEFINITELY make up for their misgivings and they are:    
The #T- 6 House Special Won Ton Soup ---some of the best  Won Ton soup I've ever had. Just make sure you say \"HOUSE SPECIAL\" Won Ton Soup or they will  give you plain Won Ton Soup, which is still good, but the house special has chicken, shrimp, beef, pork and FRESH veggies. This soup is OUTSTANDING and worth coming in for if not for anything else.
Also good are the Pot Stickers, Orange Chicken, Moo Shoo Chicken and S & S Pork.
I know it is weird that they don't have the 3 staples, but the rest of the food on the menu MORE than makes up for it!

Did I say how awesome the \"House\" Won Ton Soup is here?"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything here! My favorite would be the egg rolls...honestly amazing!  Every time we come here we try something new, and we have yet to be disappointed...the steamed wantons, the Lo Mein, Genereal Tso...and so many other dishes. Definitely a must try when it comes to Chinese food..."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for your Friday night or any night Chinese craving. We did pick up and it was ready when we walked in. The food is fantastic, best Chinese I have had in years. The beef and broccoli has a really non over powering sauce, not too much sauce and not too little. Perfect amount. The broccoli is fresh and crisp and not soggy at all. The egg rolls and crab Angels (rangoon) were perfectly fried and not soggy and they even gave us an extra one. Rice was excellent as well as sweet and sour chicken. This place is GREAT!!! I highly recommend it and it will be our go to spot for all Chinese cravings.  
Ps - the price is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Beijing Express is the best! Super fast, very authentic, and absolutely delicious. I've ordered from them a half dozen times and each dish (all vegetarian for me) has been amazing, especially the garlic eggplant and vegetable chow fun."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero; I would. Wow the food is horrible. I'm sure Chinese people would be offended if they tasted Beijing Express. Any Asian restaurant that has crunchy rice- has problems. I am shocked this place has good reviews. Please don't waste your money and go else where."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch based off yelp reviews and were not disappointed.  It was the first time eating here for all 3 of us.  I had sweet and sour pork and the other 2 people in our party had sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  All of the entrees were great.  White rice and brown rice were both perfect.  We got an appetizer of fried dumplings.  I would usually prefer these to be a little more crispy when they're fried but they were quite delicious.  The restaurant is very small, you order at the counter and they bring you the food to your table.  No public restrooms that we could see.  Staff were busy in the back but did come take our order and deliver food.  Beyond that we didn't see them.  Food was really good, prices were fair for what you get.  I'd definitely eat here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Had my tooth pulled an could only eat soup. This place was amazingly fast an the amount of food you get with them is crazy. I have told everyone to go here for fast great service an food. They deserve it. Thanks."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, when I order the \"house special tofu\" I assume it comes without meat. Wrong. Pork, chicken and shrimp comes with it. The lack of clarification is less than appealing and I won't be returning to Bejing Express. Their inability to recognize the confusing menu is absurd. BYE."}
{"text":"The bombest dot commest Asian food in Tempe, for sure. Orders are ready quick, always warm, and inexpensive. Staff is friendly and works swiftly. Try the sweet n sour chicken with fried rice, beef n broccoli with steamed, or the pork dumplings. Mmm. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Oh em gee. This place is sooo yummy. First time ordering and it will now be our go to for Chinese takeout. Shrimp with garlic sauce, egg rolls, wonton soup and the House special lo mien. Only deducted 1 star by I ordered chicken with garlic sauce and not shrimp. Still amazing, just double check your order."}
{"text":"They have great dumplings! They have great combo deals too. Very affordable and tasty American Chinese food."}
{"text":"Had the beef with broccoli and it's the BEST I've ever had! This is definitely going to be my go to chinese place...and I'm in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on Christmas & received food in timely fashion. Food was awesome, also priced right. Recommend to anyone looking for some Chinese food for delivery. Yum!"}
{"text":"We feel lucky to have found Beijing Express as our former favorite Chinese food restaurant changed management and became the worst food. Beijing is really fast and the food has been good every time. Our favorites are veggies with noodles, salt and pepper shrimp and veggie fried rice. The vegetable soup is delicious!  My go to when I'm feeling a bit under the weather or on a chilly evening. Beijing's doesn't look like much inside the restaurant but the food won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Beijing Express is a typical Chinese takeout spot, the service was prompt and the food was fair. I ordered the shrimp with Lobster sauce, which honestly was forgettable, but other dishes we ordered were delicious!"}
{"text":"Got this delivered, yay! Yum! Too many mushrooms and not enough bean curd in the hot and sour soup, but still yummy! Huge portions! Courteous driver!"}
{"text":"We are very fond of this place in our apartment. The food is great and the best we've found in the area (although there are better places out there in the world). They always deliver earlier than their estimate. And the people that work there are wonderful."}
{"text":"We ordered Wonton Soup, Crab Angels, Chicken Fried rice, Fried dumplings, and Chicken Lo Mein. When the food got to us it was super hot which was nice but we were missing the Chicken Lo Mein. That being said the food didn't blow us away it was good just not AMAZING. Food was also rather expensive, especially to be missing a whole dish. Probably going somewhere else next time"}
{"text":"I stop by here often on the way home from work. The House Fried Rice is excellent and loaded with meat and vegetables, and there is usually enough left to take to work the next day for lunch. I also highly recommend the sweet and sour chicken, as well as the crab angels and the lo mein."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've ever head! I'm glad we finally found our go to place after trying multiple places that were a fail."}
{"text":"Garbage.  Chicken soft and mushy.  No veggies provided with anything.  Never go back again."}
{"text":"Cheap, but excellent quality. Tired of the way your life is going? Order the cream cheese wontons."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Definitely our new go to Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was with my daughter at her house and it was lunch time and both of us were hungry, didn't want to cook and unable to move our cars due to movers moving things out of the house, so I grabbed my phone to check out the Eat24 app and found Beijing Express.

After checking out the menu, I placed our order and within 35 minutes it was at her door!

We ordered the sweet & sour chicken & pepper beef lunch combos and an order of crab angels (aka crab rangoons). 

I have to say this was some the best Chinese food I have found in the valley. The pepper beef was cooked perfectly and full of peppers & beef. My daughter also loved her sweet and sour chicken.

Beijing Express was a great find on Eat24!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this establishment. Ordered two entrees and two sides for delivery. Order came well within the 45 min window I was provided. Food very good. Tender beefabd lsrge juicy shrimp. We will order from this restaurant again. Excellent dinner!"}
{"text":"I stopped in this place one night randomly and fell in love. The people are nice. The food is made when it's ordered and you can even see them make it. Always spotless inside. 

The food is amazing. Full of flavor and always fresh. This place is by far one of my favorite Chinese restaurants!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, cold Dr. Pepper, great food, & large portions. Have picked up once and eat on the patio the other."}
{"text":"The egg drop soup was delightful! Orange chicken was good, and I hope to go back soon to try some other options."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Chinese food restaurant. I miss my Chicago days when I had several good Chinese restaurants to choose from... Today I found it. I'm no longer impressed with Pei Wei. J
I had shrimp egg foo young special with pork fried rice and and an egg roll. The egg foo young patties were huge. Plenty of shrimp."}
{"text":"Eww. This place tastes like old feet. I got the teriyaki chicken, crab wontons, and chicken fries rice. I will make the drive to pei Wei next time. Gross."}
{"text":"I placed a take out order thru Yelp and it was a great experience.  When I placed my order, I added an additional note and asked for all white meat and extra sauce.  Normally when I order online with a special request, it is always ignored.  Not here though.  They were able to accommodate me with no issues.  I knew there would be an extra charge but when I picked up my order, it was only $1 more.  I don't carry cash on me so I wasn't able too but told them to go ahead and charge my card if they needed too and the guy at the counter said not to worry about it.  I appreciate that.  I ordered enough food to last a couple of days and the portions were perfect.  I ordered the fried dumplings, lunch combo of orange chicken with brown rice and an order of crab puffs.  (they might be called crab angels here).  Everything was great from ordering, picking up, to eating it.  I would recommend and I plan on going back.  Thank you ."}
{"text":"Good American style Chinese food, nice service.

I was in town for work, and one night I wasn't feeling well and did not want to leave the hotel. So I found this place on Yelp and luckily they have delivery service. I found their menu on the Yelp app and ordered over the phone. The lady on the phone was very nice and patient with me and answered all my questions. I ordered the wonton vegetable and pork soup as well as the broccoli beef, my favorite. She informed me that delivery will be no extra charge! woohoo, but it will take about an hour, which is totally to be expected. 

about 40min later, I get a call and soon after a knock on my room door and I got my food. The guy who delivered was very nice and things was packaged well. I did give him a fat tip for his troubles, and they do accept credit cards. The food tasted great and my soup was full of veggies and meat. The broccoli beef dish was loaded with soft stir fried beef, slightly salty but good with brown rice. My only complaint is that the to go bag did not contain ANY eating utensils, which was a huge problem. I had to ask the hotel to bring me a fork."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here. The first time was a few months ago. They give quite a lot of food. Prices are decent. The foods always burning hot when you get it so let it cool down first. It tastes good too.

The downside. A friend of mine and me got food poisoning the day after we ate here. Im still trying to recover. Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Def ny style American Chinese. Thanks for adding broccoli to the sesame chicken, others should follow suit.

Great portions for price and the staff is kind, they came out to my car for my pick up order when my daughter was asleep in her carseat."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cashew Chicken and Shrimp with veggies combos. They have great prices, the delivery was quick and the food was good. I wish the food had been hot, but it was still warm enough to eat. I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"It's not real Chinese food. It's vegetables meat and soysource. I bet the cook is not Chinese either. It's so sad that America people have to eat this and be amazed with it \"Chinese Taste \". Hard to be happy with the food here. I gave  it a 3 star cuz it's fast. I hope the business can create a Chinese menu for picky eater like me."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food came early and was super hot still! We ordered fried wontons, crab angels, wonton soup, egg drop soup and almond chicken.

Expected the standard food in cardboard boxes and lukewarm at best. What we got was in plastic containers, super hot, and delivered ahead of schedule!!! Thoroughly impressed to say the least.

Everything was delicious. The soup had flavor. They included the extra spices I asked for. The fillings on the wontons and crab angels were all flavorful as well (and real meat in the wontons, not just fried wraps!).

It was so good, that I just ordered from here again tonite!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese food, no real complaints."}
{"text":"My go to for delivery, great quality for fair prices. Love the egg drop soup. But if you want chopsticks you have to specify."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, inexpensive, and very tasty. The food was piping hot and included cutlery, hot sauce, soy sauce and fortune cookies ! Delivery charge is $2 which is a great deal !"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and decided to check this place out.  The environment was decent, even near closing.  The food was EXCELLENT and the wait time was almost nothing.  The staff was pretty friendly even when we came in a mere 30 minutes before closing.  My only faux pas is that it seemed a bit pricy, but then again we did order an appetizer and two entrees. 
 Some entrees have a small size option.  We will definitely be back for more scrumptious treat!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Beijing Express several times.  They have not disappointed me.  The food is delicious, and deliver time was very reasonable.   This is a nice little family run place, and they take pride in their food.  I'll definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"This place is frickin' lit. Waited maybe five minutes for my food and found out they delivered. 10/10 new go-to place"}
{"text":"Beijing express is consistently good take out or delivery! There is a very reasonable delivery fee!"}
{"text":"Food is really good, I usually order the sweet and sour chicken and pork fried rice and it's awesome! I can always tell that it's fresh and I usually pick up and the staff is friendly. I would recommend them at a great go to for Dinner!"}
{"text":"Bad service? Try no service. We waited 15 minutes after we sat down.... They ignored us so we left.  Also NO air conditioning. Very humid... and the place reeked of fish. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Your typical Chinese take out. Very fast service and friendly staff. The soups are awesome and I like their fried rice."}
{"text":"First time we tried this place and it was just okay, the Orange chicken was grisly I had to keep spitting it out of my mouth and the fried rice had about 4 peas that's it rice and 4 peas?? I think fried rice usually has more than that in it, not much flavor to it. Sorry, but the Egg roll was all cabbage and parts were raw. I was hoping for so much more because it's right down from my house. I hope it was just a one time thing..."}
{"text":"I've ordered food from this place close to a dozen times (my guy is obsessed with house fried rice). I've ordered delivery, pick up, as well as eaten inside. 
The service is great. As far as the food goes, its fast Chinese food that isn't greasy and tastes delicious! Vegetables are always fresh and never overcooked! 
If you're contemplating ordering delivery, you won't regret it. The food always comes hot and sometimes arrives early, but never late."}
{"text":"So happy there is a good Chinese restaurant that delivers!  I have ordered from Beijing Express about a half dozen times and have never been disappointed,  In fact, I have had nothing but amazing food and service from them.  

Is it \"authentic\" Chinese food?  I dont know, I have never been to china.  but it is delicious, fresh, and the portions are huge and  make for good leftovers.  

So far my favorite is the Mongolian beef, extra spicy, and an egg roll with the home made spicy mustard.  I am a big fan of spicy mustard, and this stuff is HOT!!  Make sure you ask for the home made stuff, as they also have the standard issue packets of hot-ish mustard.

So is it a five star take your  business clients from China out to lunch to impress them restaurant?  Probably not, but its the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Your employee does not have right to force me to pay his tips. I pay tips only for those who deserve, not for those who keep annoying me. The Chinese deliver-man who wears glasses clearly did not get it. I swear if he comes again I won't give shit to him, but I think you will make a wise decision to fire this guy so the problem should be solved."}
{"text":"Good tasting American style Chinese food.  They feature no MSG.  I am eating my fried rice and chicken vegetables right now.  Hope I don't get food poisoning like another reviewer did.

The service is very fast and efficient to handle all the take out and delivery customers. The lady at the cash is very sharp and quick!  

There is no washroom in the restaurant.  Need to use the public washroom in the building behind (ask them for the key first)."}
{"text":"Customer service was superb. Prices are great, especially lunch prices.
Restaurant does not serve fountain drinks, but does have a varied selection of bottled and canned beverages. 2 litres of soda also available. 
Lunch specials come with egg drop soup and fried wontons.
Egg drop soup was a little bland, but overall not bad. Wonton chips were crispy and not oily.
Husband ordered teriyaki chicken with brown rice, I ordered Szechuan chicken with brown rice.
Teriyaki chicken was full of flavor. Sauce tastes of honey!
Szechuan chicken had good spice, but was not as flavorful as the terikyaki sauce. Would probably order something else in the future. 
Brown rice was very dry and seemed slightly undercooked. 
Vegetables appeared fresh and were not overcooked and mushy. 
Would certainly eat here again based on customer service and prices alone. Food was decent."}
{"text":"Great food and delivery! Super minimal delievery charge and good portion sizes."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is one of the better chinese restaurants in AZ.  My office and I have gotten take out here numerous times with more good than bad experiences.  Today i came here and ate in for the first time as i was having my car stereo installed near by.  It was good fast service. Only thing i can critique about the food is that the fries rice has to be better.  Anyways this place is a solid 4 when it comes to chinese restaurants in AZ but would be like a 2 if compared to a lot of hole in the wall chinese restaurants in LA."}
{"text":"Found this place in a roundabout way through Yelp. They agreed to deliver slightly outside their delivery area for me.  I am a big fan of their egg foo young. One of the best Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Was faster than told on email so was pleasantly surprised. Got 2 chicken combos- sesame and kung pao. Decent size portions. However the kung pao wasn't my favorite I've ever had. Not a lot of flavor and not a huge fan of the veggies."}
{"text":"I haven't actually been inside here but their delivery service is amazing! Always ahead of time, food is very hot, and the driver always friendly! The dumplings are to die for!!! Well actually everything is always perfect and delicious."}
{"text":"This place blows I ordered some food and they didn't even bring everything and it was like 4 minute deliver time so I knew something was off tastes like it was made yesterday and thrown in a microwave."}
{"text":"nice and small family run restaurant with great food you can eat in or they have fast delivery everything we tried has been really good and with enough leftover for another meal"}
{"text":"Make no mistake, this isn't fine dining, nor is it authentic Chinese food. Beijing Express excels in your typical Americanized Chinese fast food, with old stand bys such as General Tso's chicken and chop suey. We stopped by for an eat-in experience, and browsed through the menu before deciding on kung pao chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, and tofu with broccoli. Service was friendly, fast, and efficient as our order was prepared and served in near record time. 

I appreciated that we were served a little bag of crispy wonton strips with sweet and sour sauce, with some egg drop soup. The soup was piping hot and a generous portion. When our meals came out, they were a heaping portion on the styrofoam plate, with plenty of rice to go with it. The kung pao chicken had a nice heat to it, from the added mixture of whole dried red chilis, while the eggplant and tofu had more of a sweet brown sauce. While our food tasted fresh and flavorful, make no mistake this isn't in any way healthy, as the sauces were an unctuous mixture, glistening with oil. 

There were plenty of leftovers to take back from ordering 3 dishes for just the two of us. Each dish was under $10, most of them hovering around the $7 range. They do not have a soda fountain, and all drinks are by the bottle.

Generally, if you are craving some fast food Chinese, this is definitely a good option for price, freshness, and quantity."}
{"text":"Our first time ordering. It was very quick and the food was tasty and the veggies were perfect! Very crisp and fresh."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good: the food. The food. OMG the food. It's really, really good you guys! Just try it.

Now the bad: We decided to eat in the restaurant. Don't do this. Get it to-go. Go eat on a park bench. Or on your couch in front of Netflix. Anywhere but here. It was about 90 degrees inside the restaurant and the atmosphere was like a cafeteria. We were all drenched with sweat when we left."}
{"text":"This place was a welcome surprise! I stopped here on the way to the Tempe Elks lodge. I ordered the sesame chicken spicy combo. Came with rice chicken soup and an egg roll. I can't even explain how good it was! And only $10. I should've taken a picture before I scarfed it all down. I even sat on the nice little patio and enjoyed my meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this place a while back and haven't went anywhere else! My father in law is always wanting to get it when he's home. Great service and food! There meal options are great as well."}
{"text":"Not a place that's very friendly to dine-in. Just a few tables but staff was really nice and we sat outside at a patio table. Their food was great got hot and sour soup, veggie roll and a beef dish. All delicious."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I have had in Arizona. It was so hard to find a place that compares to the Chinese from the east coast. It is worth the 15 min drive. Totally delicious."}
{"text":"Beijing Express is great. We order delivery from them all the time. Walnut Shrimp, General Tso chicken, fried rice and chicken lo mein are all excellent. Definitely give them a shot"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from bejing express a couple times now and both times were pretty good. 
This is one of thee better Chinese places I've been to in Tempe area."}
{"text":"This was the first good Chinese food I've had in Tempe. I enjoyed everything I had, the prices were reasonable, and unlike most Chinese places that take forever to get your order ready, our order was ready in about thirty minutes for pickup. I wouldn't even recommend trying other chinese places in tempe because of how horrible the service has been. Beijing Express definitely offers the best service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you want for a Chinese take-out place! Yummy, cheap and fast! The crab ragoon was so good, the perfect mix of salty and sweet! The shrimp lo mein was also good! Very standard and traditional, but nonetheless very good! Will continue to order in the future and grub hub made it super easy!"}
{"text":"After a long weekend and day moving from Yuma to Tempe, we were all totally pooped-hungry- and didn't know a soul or resturant in town yet. Great service, friendly staff and their delivery is super fast. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today for a carry out lunch today. I didn't even check Yelp, I just impulsively craved Chinese and was sick of Panda Express. It was somewhat spooky that nobody was dining-in, but I saw the cashier preparing a few carry out orders so at least I had the comfort of knowing I was not alone.

Beijing really nailed my order, and I was in and out within 5 minutes. Express indeed. The chow fun was served piping hot and truly made to order. I asked for things to be extra spicy and it came out at spice level of about a 7/10 just right for me. The flat noodles were both tender and plentiful. Beef was also generously applied thinly sliced and not overcooked. The support cast of onions and cabbage added to the delicious dish.

Pretty hyped that I found a new non-corporate Chinese spot. Will be back to try a few of their discounted lunch specials. Prices are just right."}
{"text":"I used to live walking distance from here and when I moved one of my first thoughts was how sad I was to be farther away from Beijing. I still make the drive however. It is a little hole in the wall, nothing fancy but the food is fantastic, prepared quickly, and the people are always nice. Some of my favorites include the shrimp lo mein and the crab puffs."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese spot.. it was the House Wonton Soup that won me over but we've never been disappointed with the food, service or delivery..

The chicken teriyaki, curry shrimp, chicken & eggplant, beef broccoli, veggie low mein and our three must haves green beans, eggplant, wonton soup.. you get a lot of food, delivered timely and it's always hot!! 

You cant go wrong with this place.. this is not upscale or fancy food .."}
{"text":"Delivery speed: 10. Friendliness: 10. Food: 8. Will definitely order again since it's the best Chinese delivery food near me."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here twice and really enjoy it! We have tried the general tso, Sesame and sweet and sour chicken with the first two being our favorites so far. Fried rice is great and egg rolls are the best I have had since living in Arizona. We will continue to order out from here!"}
{"text":"Another great find on Yelp!  I got the chicken egg foo young lunch special which came with fried rice and a spring roll.  The portion was so big that I have enough leftover for lunch tomorrow.  So good!"}
{"text":"Had chicken fried rice, not too bad.  It was delicious and made just the way I like it...service not good at all but hey it's a Chinese joint so bad service is expected."}
{"text":"The best Chinese Place in Tempe, quick service, and great food!"}
{"text":"Their delivery service is always exceptional - always fast & the food arrives hot!

I really enjoy their chow fun & mei fun, where as my roommate loves the beef & broccoli. I've yet to have a poor experience with Beijing Express - both in their delivery & eating at their restaurant. I don't expect it to be fancy, I don't expect it to be legit traditional Chinese - as this is fast Americana NY style Chinese food & in with that knowledge, its probably the best I've had in the valley. :) 

Keep it up Beijing Express & Thank you for the tasty food!"}
{"text":"If I could review with ZERO stars I would..first the food is sub part. My General Tso chicken is mushy and lacks any flavor. House Fried rice was greasy and had almost no meats. The chow mein is disgusting literally there is 7 pieces of chicken.  I counted.  

Now that brings me to the pathetic customer service. Ordered chow mein..where I usually order from it is noodles. So I call back explain I'm here at a hotel my food is soggy and the chicken isn't in noodles... he says well that's the chow mein many people make that mistake.  I offer to pay if they can just bring it please. Mind you I just spent $35 and tipped driver  $4. The guy says minimum delivery is $15!!!!!! I said I just ordered he said oh well you order wrong thing minimum $15. I told him that fine I'll order 2 , now I have to pay ANOTHER delivery fee. I informed him this was horrible customer service and he said . ok literally he said ok. So needless to say NEVER ORDER FROM THEM. YOUR MONEY IS NOT APPRECIATED and they're completely flippant about customer service."}
{"text":"Flavor was bland and we got the sesame chicken and orange chicken and could taste the difference between the two. Not sure if we just got jipped twice or what but our experience twice was not good with this place."}
{"text":"Order pick up thru yelp and for our first time was sooo yummy and perfect. Lunch pricing is awesome and a good amount of food. Do order egg rolls they are awesome, but do not come with lunch specials only spring rolls with some."}
{"text":"I ordered from here last week and I am surprised. It came quick and hot. Delivery guy was very polite and the food was delicious. I actually ate the leftovers the next day.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast delivery.  What could be better?

The estimated delivery time was 45-60 minutes.  Mine arrived in about 35 minutes.  
We ordered Sweet & Sour Chicken, Mongolian Beef (spicy), and Singapore Mei Fun (spicy), along with egg rolls and crab angels.  They were all delicious.  The Singapore Mei Fun was pleasantly spicy without being overbearing, as was the Mongolian Beef.  The Sweet & Sour sauce was more sweet than sour but it was still delicious.
I think I've found my new favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up lunch for me and 15 co-workers! Each order individual and paid separately. Not only did they welcome the business, they handled it like pros! Called the order in in advance  and it was hot and ready to go in the time frame given. Nothing was forgotten and every order was spot on. All that and the food was amazingly good! We will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Hot, fresh tasting, friendly service, generous portions, reasonably priced. If you want some good old fashion, real deal chinese food this is a good place to try out. I got a Mongolian Beef combo with fried rice and an egg roll at dinner time for about $8.50 tax included."}
{"text":"Noticed this place was open the other day and thought I would give it a try . . . especially since I was in the mood for some Chinese food.

Being new . . . the place was clean . . . and unlike a lot of other restaurants . . . you can actually see the entire kitchen while they are preparing you food.  The food . . . I ordered of the lunch menu . . . I got mine to take out . . . and it was still hot and delicious when I got back to the office.

Here is my problem . . . and the reason they lost a star . . . if you dine in with the lunch menu, you get soup and fried won ton . . . if you get the meal to take out . . . no soup or won tons . . . I guess next time I will have to try dining in.

And yes . . . there will definitely be another trip . . ."}
{"text":"As soon as I called in my order, I became obsessed!! The customer service was amazing. They were courteous and friendly, which mean everything to me! I was told my order would be ready in 10 minutes, I got there in 7, and my food was ready!! 
The place was very clean and smelled clean, which is also a plus for me. I loved the open kitchen area, which allows an OCD person like myself to check out everything that is going on. But nonetheless, I ordered Tofu and Broccoli with garlic sauce!! It was sooooo good! Everything  was cooked perfect, especially the tofu..I love fried, firm tofu and they delivered!! The garlic sauce was good....a little sweet for my liking, but still good. And for $6.95, I was able to get leftovers popping!!! I am happy...the end"}
{"text":"Tried the egg drop soup, beef skewers, Mongolian beef and the house low mein. Everything was just ok. They were quick to get the food together and the people I dealt with were nice the food just didn't do anything for me. I ended up tasting a couple bites of everything, then put it all back into the bag to stuff in the fridge. Maybe someone else will eat it."}
{"text":"Small quaint place with fresh food at proper portion sizes. Only wish they had ice tea. Good lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"Super great Chinese delivery. The price is right, delivery is fast, and the food is Great quality. The portions are very large and the quality is really good. I had king pao chicken with pork fried rice and an egg roll. I also got a side of steamed dumplings and a small cup of wonton soup. This is probably going to last me three days. Extremely tasteful. I'll continue ordering. Love your food and service.!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I should have read the reviews and got the wonton soup, but I thought Beijing Express was just ok. Delivery was fast and friendly though. We ordered the beef and broccoli, shrimp fried rice, General Tso's and egg rolls. It wasn't bad, but certainly not worth the raving reviews that convinced me to try this place out."}
{"text":"Dumplings, soup, and main entrees are legit. 4th time here and I had to leave a review, because I really enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"I can't write a full review I only had the ragoons and they were delicious. I would love to see if they had crab and cream cheese ragoons."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, great prices. 
Ordered a kids meal, it was a full meal! Eggroll and crab wontons were not as crispy as I hoped, but that's probably our fault as we did carry out. 
The rest of the food was decent and full of flavor"}
{"text":"I'm big on shrimp fried rice and I know everyone is different. They at least met my expectations. Now I have somewhere to go when I'm I this area."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best Chinese take-out in Tempe! Every now and then I crave Chinese food and Beijing Express is sooo good! I love the Sweet and Sour Chicken, Egg Rolls, Crab Wontons and Beef and Broccoli with brown rice! Everything is always cooked to perfection with extra sauces. Delivery is quick, but I live close by and sometimes opt to go pick up the order so I can eat quicker! Don't forget the handful of fortune cookies that makes Chinese take-out complete. With these guys on speed dial, the future looks good and so does my dinner!"}
{"text":"Pretty good takeout! I've ordered twice now, delivery was on time, order correct, and huge portions. I'm able to eat leftovers for a couple more days too! Also, ordering on Yelp is sooooo convenient! We ordered egg rolls, hot and sour soup, general tso chicken, Mongolian beef, and pork fried rice. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I order here all the time, reasonably priced and delicious! Delivery usually takes about an hour in a half on weekends. No complaints."}
{"text":"So my second time here first time eating in and everything we ordered was amazing we all got the special combo 7.50 and it was a plate full of food , you get rice a egg roll with the convo I got the mongollion beef , mom got veggie egg foo young and dad sesame chicken and it was all great and the egg  drop soup was delicious and thick. Definitely great fresh food and big portions"}
{"text":"If your looking for a Tempe Chinese place, COME HERE! Ive heard about this place and finally tried it! 
Bought broccoli beef! Very good. Enough of both. Wasn't skimpy on the beef!
Omg- thee best chicken lo main ive personally ever had.
Their crab puff(angel) was good. 
Same with the egg rolls...never found a Chinese egg roll i actually liked. Bomb
Shrimp fried rice needs more seasons but alot of shrimp!
Egg drop soup bomb!
Their general Tao. Was ok...i think a lil too sweet.
A lil pricey. But totally worth ever dollar! Everything taste fresh, hot not soggy. 
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Based on my first trip, Beijing Express is very good.  Mongolian beef and General Tso's chicken and dumplings were all better than the same offerings by other Chinese in the area.  They gave me a lunch special price on a Sunday at 3:03pm, which was very appreciated.  The portion sizes are substantial, the vegetables in the Mongolian beef were fresh and plentiful.  The location is clean, and they deliver which is awesome.  It's nothing ground breaking, but it is now my go-to Chinese place.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Just like the east coast Chinese I am use to. Egg rolls are yummy. They actually know the difference between lo mein and chow mein"}
{"text":"Wow my third rating, been a long time since i could afford any restaurant food. Thank you Beijing Express for still making delicious dishes. I got my money worth in leftovers! What was so good? Here be my order...

WON TON SOUP. Again. How do all the others get it so wrong when its SO simple? Get it here! Others SUCK, these guys ROCK.

EGG DROP SOUP...same info above applies. Simple dishes done so well.

SHRIMP FRIED RICE. Solid fresh tasty. You think fried rice is simple but i've had plenty of crap and so have you.

SHRIMP FOO YOUNG... Sàvory, tasty and d*mn fine fresh stuff. This is what its supposed to be like here in americanized chinese food dude.

Because they do so many dishes great, i've confidently tried other dishes and got hooked. TRY IT AND SEE.   Good prices, fast delivery. Just wish i had a coupon!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming from the grand opening. Love the price for the lunch. If you stay for a lunch combo you will receive a soup. I used to love the sesame chicken but I believe they've changed their chicken and has been getting pieces of Carnage or something the last two times I've ordered it"}
{"text":"Got take out from here.  It was ready EXTREMELY fast and the portion sizes were very generous.  To start I tried the steamed dumplings.  The outer dough was pretty thick and chewy, but I didn't mind it.  The inside had some kind of pork filling.  I enjoyed the dipping sauce.  Overall, pretty tasty and I would order again!

The ma po tofu was good, but not amazing.  I'm not sure I would order again, I'd probably try something else.

In general, I'd give this place another shot.  The price was right on the food and it was nice and satisfied my hunger.  Don't expect amazing gourmet food, it's a local neighborhood spot that serves up quick and easy eats."}
{"text":"pretty decent for az chinese. can be on and off sometimes but overall good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Right  down the street from my house and they have yet to disappoint  :) Always fresh food, for both delivery and take out. We order the broccoli  and beef  special and usually the sweet and sour chicken special. Also good is the crab puffs, fried dumplings, and spring rolls. They have very decent prices for  the amount of food you  get and they promote  no MSG. Glad I found this little place."}
{"text":"Just got delivery from  there and never will again. I don't know what the shrimp was breaded in, but it was weird and gummy. My husband couldn't finish his because \"the meat stuck to his teeth like gum.\" Just gross and overpriced. Expensive mistake."}
{"text":"Eh it's more like 3.5 stars but I rounded down. 
Delivery came much faster than estimated so that was great!
Food was pretty good. Not my favorite, but you do get a ton of food for the price! Husband loved it! I thought it was more just ok. My stomach wasn't too happy after though. 
If we do get them again we'll probly go in and order; while the food is cheap, delivering it is not."}
{"text":"For under $20. Delivery
Dragon and Phoenix (chicken/shrimp & veggies) like kung pao!!!   crab angels and spring roll. Delish."}
{"text":"Best chinese spot in Tempe hands down. Been here 3 years and haven't found a better spot. The Teriyaki chicken and General Tso are my favorite and the lunch menu is super cheap. They can sometimes skimp on the servings but for $5.95 you can't expect a whole lot. Depending on how hungry you are, the extra meat may be worth it. I definitely would recommend for the average person looking for a Panda Express alternative or a new local Chinese spot to fall in love with."}
{"text":"I was on the fence between 3-star and 4-star, but the other good reviews caused me to give the benefit of the doubt.

I dined in and had the orange chicken lunch.  What I really like about this place is the authenticity.  They're all speaking chinese back there (you're not greeting by some bubble-headed teen like some chinese places).  The orange chicken was really good.

The not-so-good: the place smelled kinda funky.  The rice was dry, but think that's just the style, and I prefer the gloopy rice.  The spring roll was cold by the time I got to it, even though the rest of the meal was steamy hot.

I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"I spent several weeks looking for a good Chinese restaurant to compare to the ones I loved in the Atlanta area.  I finally stumbled on Beijing Express for lunch and was greatly pleased.

In Atlanta, for lunch, many Chinese restaurants offer a number of entrees at reduced prices and lunch portions from dinner.  The lunches usually come with a cup of soup (small bowl) and a spring roll.

The places I tried first were of mixed quality and taste.  The best one had great quality food and wonderful flavors, but you bought a dinner portion for lunch.  They only had two soups - dinner portions also.

Then, I found Beijing Express.  The decor is nothing to write about, and the restaurant is small, but I was met at the door by a young man with a smile who proceeded to take my order (you do that before you sit).  He was helpful with my choices.  The meals are lunch-sized and come with a spring roll.  The soup is separate, but the prices are very good, so I always order the won ton.

The pork Egg Foo Young I ate there was very good, as was the Mongolian Beef the next visit.

The flavors are very good, especially for the price.  Both times I ate there, the price was under $10!

There are other places I've read about and want to try, but Beijing Express has made me very happy!"}
