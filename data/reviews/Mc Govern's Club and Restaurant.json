{"text":"This place is easy to overlook in Sun Prairie, but it's pretty good at what it is.  Don't expect a big beer selection but if you are willing to settle for Spotted Cow and pub food give them a shot.  They have good wings and pretty decent specials on game days too."}
{"text":"We've been there a few times in the last few months. They are back to providing good food at decent prices. They have a nice deck in the summer months. The waitstaff have always done a good job. I would recommend them highly."}
{"text":"McGovern's is a old school supper club and bar. They have nice wait staff and bartender's and there outdoor deck is a relaxing on a pleasant day, and ya they make a nice bloody Marys."}
{"text":"An old supper club feel..... I doubt the place has been updated in the past 3 decades. But the food and service was good. Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"Welcome to McGovern's Club & Restaurant. I don't do a whole lot of eating or drinking here but I am here for Trivia on Tuesday nights. And, because I am not a cheap bastard, I buy a drink or two and perhaps a side order of something.  Here's what is great about McGovern's: the service is top notch. The servers genuinely want you to be happy. They are great at making suggestions and following through on orders (and getting them right). The food, what I've tasted, is decent and affordable.  The menu has a lot of variety. Steaks, seafood, sandwiches, soup, salads, burgers, wraps and desserts. The menu runs five crammed pages. You WILL find something to like, probably many things to like.  The pricing is very fair. Steaks and seafood is higher than the rest of the menu, burgers run between $5.50 and $9.75 depending on how gourmet you get. Sandwiches run between $3.25 and $7.00, again, depending on what you're ordering.  Drinks are also affordable. I pay $5.00 for a good Bourbon Old Fashioned, loaded with both fruit and olives. My buddies are really happy with beer prices, and there's a great variety from which to choose.  What's lacking? The liquor selection, particularly in the land of whiskey. That's why I'm ordering cocktails.   The ambiance is that of an old tavern. It is almost a homey feel to it. There's a few large screen TVs in each corner, so no matter where you're sitting, you will not miss the game.  Parking is also plenty, although the lot does get rather full during the Trivia event.  Over all, this is a nice find, as long as a good whiskey selection isn't your thing. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some good, regular food and figured we'd hit our neighborhood supper club. Lots of things were the same as last time: the server was very nice, the salad bar was still good (though I think they should slice up those hard-boiled eggs), and the decor still needs updating.   I got the haddock again and enjoyed it. I filled up on salad bar and appetizers (deep-fried mushrooms, they were fine but not stellar). My husband got the seafood platter and was amazed at the sheer amount of breading on everything. It states in the menu that it comes deep-fried, but I wouldn't characterize what he got as 'delicate'."}
{"text":"Uh why was I here? Oh that's right. I was meeting up with friends. Long story short, McG's is a local watering hole. Nothing special about it except the bartender who was awesome. I asked for a dirty martini. Bartender says \"how dirty\" I said filthy and it was. Cheap prices and cold beer make for a great time with friends and if you get a little too woozy you can stumble from the watering hole at the bar to one of the dumpy holes next door instead of driving. I wouldn't recommend that though. Staying at the dumpy holes that is."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been having a weekly lunch date to get out without kids and try some local establishments.   What I had heard about McGoverns, is that it is THE place to go for your birthday. It wasn't my birthday, but we thought we would try it anyway. After learning about their birthday drink special...I agree, it is the place to go for your birthday. You should go.   But, honestly, for a dining experience, the decor was terrible. Dark, dated, the kitchen is visible from the dining area, as well as the cleaning and drink station. The decor was the biggest drawback to our lunch. It was hard to get past it.   The service was good and the food was good. I had a buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken was done amazingly. Not dry at all. The buffalo sauce was creamy and very spicy (which is a win in my book). My husband said his burger was good, but not a fresh patty.   I was reading (on the placemat) that McGoverns was established in 1935. That is a long time to be up and running and makes me root for them to succeed!"}
{"text":"Just like I remember it 30+ years ago. It was fairly modern then but today is definitely more vintage, almost frozen in time - from the original jukebox on the wall to the A-frame design and horseshoe bar. There's a nice outdoor dining area which is hard to come by these days. It's part of the adjacent motel property but doesn't at all have a canned motel restaurant vibe. The friendly atmosphere and classic supper club food makes it well worth the stop."}
{"text":"This is an old style tavern slash restaurant. Typical for the region. It is located across the driveway of the McGovern Hotel and Suites. The hotel offers a free drink or beer with thier check in, I'm good with that!  Felt like something simple and fish and chips has been on my mind for a few days. So I got comp'd my IPA and had the fish and chips. It was pretty good and satisfied the needs. Was looking at the menu and mentioned pie ala mode.....so I asked and they no longer have pies. Kinda bummed....now I'm going to think about pie all night."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service.  I wouldn 't feed this to my dog.  Tough bad steaks and slow service.  Group waited for over an hour for our food and then it was bad, really bad.  Dirty restaurant.  Where's the food inspectors."}
{"text":"I've been going to McGovern's for many years. When I was young (late 60's-early 70's) Wisconsin had \"beer only\" bars for people between the age of 18 and 21, McGovern's downstairs bar was beer only back then. In the late 90's I spent tons of time there (lived within easy walking distance, girlfriend worked there). The most incisive statement I can make is that McGovern's is reminiscent of an aging Hollywood leading lady-her luster and appeal has simply faded. It's been there since 1935, when it first opened in was on the far West end of Sun Prairie, now it's in the old part of town. The clientele seems to be the same people sitting on the same barstool almost every night. The food used to be damn good, now it's just o.k."}
{"text":"Good prices. They have a tiny kitchen so some times the food is slow. 2nd best wings in Sun Prairie. Good for kids."}
{"text":"Holy cow!  The steak is awesome!  Dudes, I am not kidding you, go here and order the steak.  I was nervous going in, wearing my Bears shirt, but they were awesome.  There was one guy, Hank, he tried to be a loud mouth about how bad the Bears are, I used my incredible Karate sills and gave him a roundhouse kick to the shin.  Everyone started applauding me and we had fireballs as Hank laid on the floor crying like a baby."}
