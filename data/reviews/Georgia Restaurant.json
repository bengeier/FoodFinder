{"text":"I hated this restaurant.  The pickles looked amazing but I thought I would die from the amount of garlic they contained.  I had schnitzel which was full of gristle. Yuck"}
{"text":"We had a family event here recently. It was not the first time there. Not by my choice. We found the food quality has been steadily declining over time. As I am writing this I am still having signs of slight food poisoning (I'm guessing from the vegetable salad with mayo). And it was very expensive too considering the overall food quality. Khachapuri was too greasy this time around, my hubby (who's from Georgia the country) makes better ones at home. Kofta was too greasy too and just didn't taste right, I couldn't pin point what was not quite ok with it. Shashlik wasn't tasty, the meat quality was low. Tabaka chicken was too dry and too salty. I took a bite and couldn't finish it. We didn't appreciate the diluted Canada Dry. On previous occasions I remember the adjabsandal was pretty good, but I have to say it's very hard to ruin this dish since it's so simple. Baje (chicken in walnut sauce) was just ok, nothing spectacular.

We didn't appreciate loud \"live\" music. It just is not romantic when people sing along with music playing from the laptop. 

The service was actually nice, timely and polite, helpful. Can't complain about that. The table wear is also very nice, pretty plates, decent cutlery, good linens."}
{"text":"I don't recommend. Don't waste your time. Food is not fresh. Read reviews on other sites."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch, was very disappointed by the service and especially by the food. I just hope that people who never tried Georgian food before will not judge it by THIS restaurant. 
We ordered Khinkali that had raw meat inside, I guess they were prefrozen."}
{"text":"This is my second time here..so far I've tried khachapuri..khinkali..ajarian khinkali and chanakhi and no complain about any of those...people are nice and friendly...Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I don't understand these people who are writing bad reviews about this restaurant and giving 5 stars to other fake Georgian restaurants which don't even have a Georgian chef and have no idea what real Georgian food taste like. Georgia restaurant is the only authentic Georgian Restaurant in Canada. Food is amazing! prices very affordable! Go and taste real Georgian food here and become client for life!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick, clean Russian / Georgian style restaurant for lunch, without those $50-$100 price tag? This place is dope. Great service and great food and drinks. Exactly what we were looking for!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant!!!
Authentic Georgian cuisine and an elegant atmosphere (but it's also the scene of some pretty amazing parties, too!)
I come from downtown just to eat here - love the Kharcho and Chicken Tabaka - they're my 2 favourite dishes!"}
{"text":"We ate the Khatchabouri, it's basically a
Georgian form of a Greek/Armenian cheese pastry. It was really tasty. But expensive at $10 each."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch on Sunday afternoon. Ordered the khinkali, khachapuri with egg on top, veal stew and kharcho soup. The food was awesome - especially the khinkali & khachapuri with egg on top. Service was great as well. Very friendly and was cool with us splitting dishes. I would highly recommend if you're looking for good Georgian food."}
