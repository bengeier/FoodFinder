{"text":"A hole in the wall it's a gem upon found. This place has the best chicken wings. There is no dining for this establishment so everything is carryout. Cash only. Their lunch portion surely will keep you full with some leftovers for dinner so come hungry. Friendly owners."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall but what a find. Traveling through, the town looks pretty rough. We saw this place and didn't even consider going in. Saw some reviews and thought, we've probably had worse. Decided to try it out, get a boat load of food and head back to the hotel room.  It was so good and plenty of it. The egg rolls aren't worth getting/paying for so I would skip those. Everything had great flavor and tasted pretty fresh.   Overall, great stop. Only thing I would give bad marks on is the dirtiness of the front door/windows.  I have this thing about the first thing to greet you in ANY business is a dirty door with millions of greasy fingerprints. It takes two minutes to clean that and make you feel good about coming in to eat there. If what you CAN SEE is that dirty, what does it look like where you CAN'T see?"}
{"text":"Hop Feng is a cash only Chinese carryout establishment. I thought my General Tso's Chicken was pretty good and the portion size was huge I actually was able to get close to 3 meals out of my lunch. For $7.50 I got the main dish, General Tso Chicken with a weird yellow rice ??? and a deep fried egg roll.  The decor is sort of dumpy with grease from years gone bye stuck to the walls and if you ever get a chance take a look a the thermostat in the corner. The amount of grease stuck to the thermostat is down right amazing. But you know what this place hits the spot for me every now and again.   And I got Fortune Cookies 3 of them...And they were all very accurate!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that Chinese food should not have YELLOW Rice!!! They do have good lunch specials and again this Chinese food wasn't very good. Still searching for a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. The only reason why I tried this place because I was next to it at the time. Still searching!"}
{"text":"Always receive fresh food!!! Tastes amazing!!! Large portions!!! Cheap prices!!! Friendly owners"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Chinese food place to eat, one I definitely travel for.  Really good food-yellow rice with onions ND always made within 10-15 mins. Fresh made to order,  and they now accept cards starting 2018!"}
{"text":"Seems like your standard carryout Chinese place. We had the General Tso and a Sesame Chicken. For three lunch specials that included rice and egg roll, we paid less than $16. Like many Chinese joints, they accept cash only (always a challenge for me  to scrounge up that paper money stuff people used to use). It was as good as any other standard Chinese carryout and based on where we live now, it may likely be our go-to for quick, cheap Chinese.  One downer, we didn't get any fortune cookies. That can't be a good fortune."}
{"text":"this place was okay I was not  blown away by the food.  I had pepper stake and vegetable lo main . I like the sauce on the pepper stake but it was a little could the lo main was good .I also didn't like that it was kind of dumpy . Next I might get food to go ."}
{"text":"Love the Shrimp Fried Rice, I've been going here for years."}
{"text":"It's ok. Just like the other reviews. The place is a small cash ony hole in the wall mom and pop place. The price is good. The food is ok. Not great. The general tso is overly breaded and the sauce is not spicy. I'd eat it again but it's not something I'd go out of my way to get"}
{"text":"Came in on a day they are busy. Nice hole in the wall place.  However it didn't seem clean of a place."}
{"text":"This is not gourmet Chinese food.   This is store-front-hole-in-the-wall-greasy-yummy-awesome Chinese food.  Please do not expect it to be anything else.  The portions are great.  The food is good, fresh, tasty Americanized Chinese food.  Unless we are looking for Buffet, Hop Feng is our place.  The staff is friendly and polite.  The service is quick, even on Friday nights.    Any of the \"Garlic Sauce\" dishes are my favorite.  The house Lo Mein is superb.  The fried dumplings are awesome. Crab Rangoons - yum! Happy Family is also great.  Before I just list the whole menu, I'll just stop...  I have never gotten anything bad there."}
{"text":"The biggest downside is that this little take out only Chinese place is cash only. No cards of any kind are accepted here so be prepared.    Oddly enough, the large chicken wings are really good here. An order is 4 very large, fried wings with a bed of rice."}
{"text":"I enjoyed every dish I have had there. I'm a huge fan of their General Tso's chicken and egg drop soup. They have some amazing dishes, and they pile your plates with food."}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese carryout. Mainly because it is close to us. The food is as good as most of the genre and they share the same quirks, cash only, the same menu, the same flavors, heavy on the MSG, as all other Chinese carryout places. The execute well, the food is always hot and they have never messed up my order."}
{"text":"If I'm craving for some cheap and flavorful fried chicken wings, this is my go-to place to get some. A few of my family members always order trays of their chicken wings for parties/get together also."}
