{"text":"Recently tried their brunch. They have some decent menu items and variety. Coffee was pretty decent which is always a must review for a brunch place. They say they charge for refills but they didn't charge us. They also say their 3 egg BIG breakfast comes with 3 eggs but it came with 2. Perhaps I didn't read the fine print about the pre-11am deal which is $7.99 for a bacon, sausage and 3 egg breakfast (save 2 dollars and save 1 egg?) Anyway, the potato rosti square was a nice change from hashbrowns and the bacon plus sausage was generous. 

My dining companion enjoyed French Toast - 1 big slab but seemed really good and filling. Also $13+. 

Overall, prices are to be expected for this area and food quality was good. I wouldn't run back here but if I was West of Woodbine and too lazy to walk into the Beach proper (which I was) I would stop here again."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick sandwich (panini) which my wife and I split, and was very good.  The lattes were excellent.  Unlike many places, they know the difference between a latte and a cappuccino.

Tips;
The french toast looked amazing.
They use free-range chicken.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for brunch this morning and had a really good experience. The breakfast / brunch menu is nice with some variations on common dishes. Muesli French toast and Cajun chicken panini is what we had which were both excellent. Their breads were nice and fresh too.

Quaint little cafe with a small patio. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is a fine example of a restaurant trying really hard to make things right... but it's just not working.  This restaurant tries to do thing right, like making dishes from scratch and having friendly service, but it just doesn't work if the food sucks.

I've tried two things from this place: the pizza, which tastes like cheese bread from Loblaws that was reheated and the bolognese pasta that looks like the sauce was made from scratch but was just bleh.  I can tell they tried really hard with the pasta - going the traditional route of carrots,onion, celery base with beef, but it doesn't taste much better than me throwing pasta and sauce together at home (and I think I can actually do a better job).  I wish I had just gone to Pizza Pizza instead.

What makes me angry about this place is that it charges so much!  I just don't see anything about this place that would allow it to think that it has the right to charge me $2 for a juice that I can buy at the local convenient store (same brand) for less, much less.  Look, you can't just open up a small fancy dancy shop, serve basic food poorly and think you can just charge people a higher price because we don't know any better!"}
