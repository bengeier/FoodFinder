{"text":"It was the worst experience I've ever receive. I've been a loyal customer and always bought food in this restaurant when I'm in the area, for years. I know the owner very well and she's always answered my needs. But now there's a new lady there that only cares about her job rather then the customers needs and satisfaction. A company with that type of employees in which offers horrible service like what I've received, will never go far. So if I was the owner, I would try and remove those that are ruin my restaurants image. With that being said, I will never NEVER go to this restaurant again after so many years and so much money spent in their restaurant. Unless they train their employees properly on how to treat their customers right or if the owner herself comes back."}
{"text":"Best General Tao in town!! The mall is a bit sketchy, the the chicken is STUPENDOUS!!

Good selection of general Chinese fast foods.

If you're having trouble finding it, it's in the food court of the Côte des Neiges mall."}
{"text":"This place is my childhood. Cheap and lot. When I was young. I came to this resto every lunch time. Must say it taste great for the price is just right. There are lot of variety between small and large size plate.

For a place like plaza côté des neiges. This spot is great to visit.  After 13 years and still open. Great !"}
