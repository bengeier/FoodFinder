{"text":"I feel pretty let down by my two experiences at Buck & Badger.  I've been for lunch and dinner. Both times, service was pretty slow, despite there not being many customers. I had the chicken pot pie ($13), which was served in a sort of upside down pyramid of a bowl... It looked large when it first came, but soon revealed itself to be shallow and a pretty sad portion for the price. It wasn' particularly flavorful either. My date had a burger, which he said was just ok.   Went back a different day and had the grilled cheese with apples and fig spread. The apples turned out to be more like apple pie filling. Way too sweet! Also, $8 for a grilled cheese is quite steep, especially since you also have to pay extra to get a side of fries.  I would love to love Buck & Badger, since I work a block away and they have a lovely fireplace. I can imagine having lunch there while reading a book by the fire. But I guess what it comes down to, is there are much higher quality and less expensive places to go in the area."}
{"text":"Used to come here often for lunch, but this is probably the last time.  The kitchen can't keep up if there are more than 6 people in the dining room- we waited an hour for a wrap and a chicken sandwich.  They shouldn't seat people if they know they aren't able to serve you in a by reasonable time. Edit - bumped up a star because they did discount the meal in the end. Food was good but just sooo long to wait"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!!! If I could give ZERO stars I would! Ever since they got new management you will sit for over 30 mins and no one will ever come ask for your order! They offer a bucket of beers for $10 but when you order will tell you \"we are out of buckets\" and just hand you 5 cold cans of beer! Also, if you ask for the tv to be changed no be surprised if you are told \"oh we are new here and don't know where the remotes are!\" What is going on!!!! Someone just ask me how I am doing!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place when it first opened and thought it was nothing spectacular. Food was dry, plain, bland, etc. Portions were small considering the price. Service was alright, again nothing spectacular. My initial thought was \"they're new, they're working out the kinks\" or something along those lines. I also figured since it was on State they would bring a good product to the table being such a prime location so I, for some reason, elected to give it two more tries. The second and third times mimicked the first time. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Thursday with some co-workers.    We left with mixed feelings, most of us disappointed and won't be back.   This place is pretty new.  It opened in the space that Ian's Pizza moved out of.  They spent quite a bit of work to completely redo the interior.  They attempted to capture the up north feel, with lots of cedar wood and country decor.   There was a gas fireplace in the middle of the dining room which I really liked.    I got the whitefish hoagie.   The menu said that all sandwiches were served with a side of sweet mustard cole slaw.\"   Hmm...I don't remember tasting any mustard, or any sweetness, or anything all.   It was weak, mostly watery cabbage with a touch of cream.    My sandwich was okay.  The red pepper aioli didn't stand out.  I actually thought it was melted cheese until I reviewed the menu just now.  There wasn't any tartar sauce served.  The sides are kind of a rip; especially the traditional fries.  They're a $3 add on and they could've easily been from the frozen section at Woodman's Foods.    One of my co-workers got the Wild Boar Burger, fries, and a CAN of beer.  His bill was $17 before tip.   Seemed pretty steep for a lunch.  It'd be different if any of the 3 items were standout, but they were lacking.  One co-worker had the grilled cheese sandwich with fig jam & sliced apples.  He was really happy with it.  Out of our group of 5, he's the only one that said he'd come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Love the fireplace inside and kinda enjoy the decor, but the service isn't very good. Went before a concert with some friends and every aspect of the meal took a overly long time. It took at least 15 minutes for our server to great us, another 15 to get our drinks, and 45 minutes to get our food. It was very frustrating, not to mention, the food was bland and had zero presentation."}
{"text":"I've given this place three chances in the past two years, and every time was a complete disappointment.  The first visit was with my wife and a friend, and probably the \"best\" experience of the three. Several beers listed were out of rotation, and still being listed on the specials board outside. The service was overall slow and inattentive. I ordered the brat, instead I was given a french dip. I figured I wouldn't be back anyways, so I left a decent tip and went on my way.  Second visit is similar with the service being even slower. We were at the restaurant for around two and a half hours. Our table's drinks were brought out when we were just about done with the appetizer. The fries that came with my meal seemed as though they had been sitting in a fridge for several days. At the end, there was no acknowledgement of error, so I left a lesser tip.  Our third and final time was a spectacle of failure. It took 15 minutes for a server to recognize our presence. Another 15 minutes pass and my wife's drink arrives, but my drink is not on tap anymore. My next drink choice does not arrive till after the appetizer again. Upon receiving our food, (burgers both ordered medium) mine is served well done, and my wife's is mostly medium rare, with a small section appearing like it hadn't touched the grill. Shortly after our food came, we find that the table behind us, who had been there since we sat down, still had not received their orders.   After three experiences like mine, I will never recommend this place to anyone. Quite frankly, it's impressive that they're still drawing a crowd of any sort."}
{"text":"The food is good and a great selection of beer. Friendly staff. The inside atmosphere is like a lodge."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place, so the other night while i was downtown I decided to check it out with a friend. We were there about 9:30pm and were seated immediately - we chose to have a seat inside.  My friend ordered the steak sandwich and fries. He thought the sandwich was \"fine.\"  I ordered the \"shoestring fries\" which were just regular fries and were virtually tasteless; I didn't think they were good at all. I also ordered the French Fried Cheese, which were like mozzarella sticks but with Wisconsin cheddar. They were warm-ish and the cheese wasn't melty at all.  Overall, I wasn't impressed and I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"The only thing special about this place is the outrageously expensive prices and uncomfortable chairs.  Never going back again."}
{"text":"Childish management. Don't waste a second of your time or a penny of your money at Wisconsin Tap Taus, Piano Bar, or Buck & Badger."}
{"text":"Hoped this place would have been better but alas it was a pretty big let down.  Service was on the awful side.   I got my beer but the wife didn't get her drink until we asked twice.   They said they would comp it but then, they didn't.  Ordered a small onion ring but charged us for a large.  The onion rings were brought out 10 minutes before our sandwiches arrived.  It just went on and on.  And the food was just meh.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Food took a very long time to come out. Friend and I ordered burgers. Orders were mixed up and the fries were cold. The burgers themselves were dry, not much flavor, with soggy piece of lettuce. Order a burger at five guys that's way better and cheaper. Told us they normally serve cookies but the chef burnt them all... Service was okay. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Three friends and I were looking for a restaurant on State Street for dinner before a show at the Overture Center. One friend said he was really craving a burger, so when we came upon the Buck & Badger, we decided to give it a try. We figured if they were able to afford to be so close to the Capitol, they had to be pretty decent. Unfortunately, this was not the case.  We were seated right away and were served drinks pretty quickly, which seemed promising, although the specialty Jack Daniels cocktails two of us ordered came in disappointingly small glasses. But then after we ordered our food we waited. And waited and waited. It was at least a half an hour before our food arrived, so even though we had initially given ourselves well over an hour to eat before our show started, we felt rushed once we finally got our food.  The food itself was okay, but nothing that wowed us. I chose not to spend the extra $3 for a side because I thought the coleslaw that came with my sandwich would be good enough -- who seriously wants to spend $3 for a side order of fries? -- but the coleslaw  was absolutely tasteless. The menu describes it as \"sweet mustard cole slaw\" but it was basically wet cabbage. My chicken sandwich, while nice and hot, was also pretty bland. The sweet potato chip breading didn't have as much flavor as I'd anticipated, and they really skimped on the chipotle mayo. My friends enjoyed their burgers but didn't seem overly impressed, and the long wait certainly didn't help.  If I'd had a chance to read reviews before we went there, I don't think we would have gone in the first place knowing that we had a show to get to and others have experienced the same very long wait we did. Also, other reviewers mentioned that they received complimentary chocolate chip cookies. We didn't get any, so either they no longer do this, or they were forgotten since we had to flag down our waitress just to pay the bill so we could get to our show on time. Either way, this was a disappointing dining experience, and with so many other restaurants on State Street, I wouldn't bother with a second visit to the Buck & Badger."}
{"text":"Wish I would have looked at Yelp before I dropped my money here.  The dining area wasn't very busy- My husband and I commented that as we watched the massive crowds outside for Maxwell days.  That should be have been our clue and we found out why. Service was slow-  took at least 10-15 minutes for my husband to get his beer he ordered.  Took a good 1/2 hour ( maybe longer) to get our food.   They had about 10 options on their menu.  I ordered the Mad Town Mac attack with pulled pork (for an additional $2).  The Mac and cheese was disgusting.  It was noodles-  not fully cooked with some crappy cheese sauce poured over it. (Like the cheap cheese from a can that gets served with a pretzel..) I could have bought Kraft in a box and been happier.  The pulled pork after I was 1/2 through eating it, I found a bunch of burned up tin foil. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: I LOVE the theme of this place.  Cozy Northwoods lodge.  Lots of pine, huge fireplaces, camo t-shirts for the wait staff.  Feels cozy and comforting.  Drinks: Pretty good specials any day of the week.  Wednesday is $4 Moscow Mules.  Beer specials every day.  What sounds like a good happy hour price.'  Food: Not terrible.  Pricing is pretty okay for what you get.  I'm a fan of the cheese fritters, the grilled cheese fondue and the fish sandwich.   All of those dishes are $9 or less and it's good portions for that price.  However.  You are a Wisconsin restaurant.  I shouldn't have to ask for tartar with my fish and I really don't think that should be an up-charge.  But the fish was really tasty with the red pepper aioli and tartar together.  Not a fan of the potato salad.  It was a literal formed scoop of it on my plate.  Didn't look appetizing, didn't taste appetizing.  Fries are good, but I'm not happy that they are a $2 up-charge to get with a sandwich or burger.  Should just come with.  They aren't $2 extra good.  The donuts are good, but didn't seem to be quite cooked all the way through.  Cheese fritters are huge and always worth it.    Service: I've only ever gone during trivia nights, so I don't know if that has something to do with it, but I think I've only been there once where the service has been good.  Most of the time, we're waiting for long periods for either our drinks, our bill, or for the waitress to check on us.  Overall, I want to like this place.  Northwoods lodge, twist on comfort food.  But I think you're trying to be just a little too classy for what you are.  Something just feels off and if it wasn't for trivia nights, I probably would have never eaten here."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by this place. The food was decent but the restaurant setting was good leaning toward great. It has a great feel to it and definitely is trying to bring a Northwoods feel to Madison. This was a spur of the moment stop for dinner. This is a place I could see myself stopping in more for the bar than to sit down for dinner.  Our waitress was great and it does have outside seating (however, I did not sit outside).  For those who are looking for a good root beer on tap this place does have Sprechers.   Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie consists of a fairly small $14 bowl of thick chicken soup with a pastry roll tossed on top of it before serving.  Will not be back for that again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's family and I were looking forward to trying this north woods themed restaurant and bar, as we are lovers of being up north and miss that feeling down here in Madison. I will say that this restaurant provided this ambiance and did it very tastefully. However, the food was severely lacking.  We all ordered burgers and were surprised to see that the burgers didn't come with french fries, instead they came with coleslaw. This would have been acceptable if the coleslaw was any good. But it had zero flavor and was a huge disappointment. Also my boyfriend's mother ordered french fries and they came out stone cold and soggy, pretty gross actually. She told the waiter and he brought out a fresh hot order of fries, but they were still soggy. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and very delicious however.  Service was decent, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Fun bar to come to trivia to, and their drinks deals were decent. Big thing to do here is the shot skis. Had the turkey salad and it was pretty average. Super cool atmosphere, very cabin like so it's fun to go in the winter"}
{"text":"So went into buck and badger last Saturday for lunch when I was on a business trip I was very impressed by the tap selection the short red headed bartender I didn't catch her name but the servers call her trap mom helped with my beer selection and talked me down from crying because my boyfriend just broke up with me. I decided to stay and try 8 of the local beers, around 6:30 a dinner rush came in and the new bartender this big long haired Fabio guy that said he trains wrestlers which I'm always suspect of wrestlers because they touch guys a lot, but he seemed cool. I had the sweet potato crusted chicken sandwich for dinner because the straight gorgy tall and lengthy bartender told me it was her favorite. All in all I really like the cabin feel and the super fly bear. Hot tip for anyone that comes keep your receipt because you get into the piano bar for free that is full of basics so I went back buck and got buck n wild."}
{"text":"We tried Buck and Badger before a show next door at the Overture Center. There's a bar room and a dining room. The ambiance is North Woods cabin with lots of light wood. The restrooms are shared with the Ivory Room in back.  The bartender greeted us immediately when we walked in and then a waitress quickly escorted us to a table. She handed us the menus which I got a kick out of. The cover is a heavy wood panel which makes the menu seem like it will be large but really it's a small assortment of appetizers, sandwiches and entrees. For the most part, the prices seemed quite reasonable. There is a fairly extensive drink menu. Our server was friendly, though not always prompt.  We weren't that hungry so we decided to just go for appetizers and had the cheese curds and boneless chicken wings. The cheese curds were excellent. A decent portion, light breading, gooey insides. We opted for blue-cheese dipping sauce rather than ranch and they were quite tasty.   The boneless chicken seemed a little pricey for what you got. We ordered the smokey bbq and a side of blue-cheese. The BBQ actually came on the side rather than being on the wings itself which I was fine with. My partner felt the chicken tasted like processed nuggets but I felt it was OK. The menu said it came with carrots and celery which we had to ask for.  I was not wowed by any of the food, but I did appreciate the ambiance, the friendliness, and for the most part the reasonable prices on the menu."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I ordered a specialty drink from their craft drink menu. It was supposed to be a blackberry bubbly something. It was a d ad ringer for Robitussen with a splash of champs. It was absolutely awful!!  Two sips was all I could muster. Those who sampled it agreed it was off-putting. Two in our group ordered the old fashions. They were similarly disappointed in the taste. We ordered cheese curds which arrived before our drinks.  Mind you, the bar was not busy at all!  Curds had a weird texture but the dipping sauce was very good!!  Don't think we will be back. It was an unfortunate waste of money for expensive drinks that go to waste."}
{"text":"Ok, well, let's get a few things out of the way first.  This place isn't very big, so there's not much space to do anything. It's also kind of expensive when it comes to drinks around Madison.   So why am I giving it four stars? Well, a drink purchase here can be used as the cover to get into the Ivory room, and the second, and much more important reason, is that they have shot skis.  SHOOOOOOOOT SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"\"It's a safe bet everything was frozen at one time...\"   \"The ranch dressing was good.\"  \"The beer was cold.\"  \"This is half a cabbage!\"  \"What are these potato slices with sugar?\"  It's good, when you are starving and hungover. But I sure won't be making this place a must eat in Madison."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today (12/6/12), and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I ordered the Wild Boar burger (whoa, I ate wild boar!), and, although the patty was quite small, I was full at the end of the meal. The flavor of the burger/toppings was really nice, and the fries were great. Be warned, though, that burgers come with a small side of coleslaw, but any other sides (fries, sweet potato fries, etc) cost extra.  The guy I went with had the Bison Burger, and enjoyed it, though he did not like his sweet potato fries (they were \"soggy\").  It is a little pricey for lunch (approx. $20 if you get a burger with a side and drink), but at least you get a free warm chocolate-chip cookie at the end of your meal!!!   +1  Also, I love that the place is so new that it still smells like fresh-cut wood! Yum!"}
{"text":"I love coming here when it's warm and drinking a Bloody Mary or 5 and people-watching. It's within eyeshot of capital square, and when the farmer's market is going on you have a GREAT view of everything and everyone. Service is good, apps are good, and the Bloodies come with the most charming little beer chasers. Come on a Saturday in the spring, sit outside, get day-drunk, and watch the Madisonians do their thang."}
{"text":"Buck and Badger is my jam. And what i mean by that is it is my now go to place for a drink with some friends and a good time. I love the casual bar environment when you first enter; the wooden feel, bears, and the awesome bartenders/servers.   Here's the thing. Yelp started out for food and now you can review just about anything on it, so why not review an experience. Yes, if you come here for just the food, you will probably leave disappointed as the salads are plain, the brunch is average & super sweet, and the prices are not really worth what you get. But if you do come for a beer, mimosa, bloody, or shot you are in for a treat. Drink specials galore and here's what you should order.   1. Lodge Fries -- these seasoned potato slices are the bomb with some lawrys seasoning and sour cream and chive dip. you can't go wrong 2. Cheese Curds -- we are in Wisconsin after all! These fresh little buds come right out of the oven and with the spicy aioli on the side, you won't be disappointed.  3. Shot Ski -- grab 3 of your closest friends and take a shot together. literally, pick that ski or paddle up and bottoms up!  4. Ivory Room -- buy a drink here and keep the receipt, you can connect to the ivory room and get free admission.    I had a blast here for brunch with some friends and the game in the back. The people are great, the servers are fun, and the drinks keep on comin.   Happy experiencing."}
{"text":"Great service,food was tasty but you get charged 50 cents for a side of ranch. Coleslaw that comes with sandwiches standard is tasty-we also had sides of sweet potato fries and French fries. Husbands burger was average. Sandwiches a bit on messy side due to dressings. Great decor- Northwoods theme. Good beer selection. Tasty Bloody Mary with garnishes."}
{"text":"Good location.  Place is clean.  Food was edible but unimaginative bar fare executed in a below average way.   Realize that service is in the eye of the beholder but it took 40ish minutes to get food at lunch when the place was dead.  Given the numerous places to grab pub grub in the area, I would probably pass on this place for food.   An acceptable place to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Fairly new establishment that took over for the pizza place (Ian's) that moved to across the street. Feels like a huge sauna in here. They definitely put some money into the place. I did not eat here, so this review is really just to remind me to return next time for some grub!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the Buck and Badger after work for a quick beer and an appetizer while waiting for friends.  Their beer selection was pretty good.  They had the beer that I prefer, so that was good.  But the reason for my review is the bartender was a bit of a dick.  He was wearing a cap bro-style (on backwards) and had this phony superior air about him.  It was off-putting.  Some people sat next to me and their first three beer requests the B & B did not have.  The bartender gave them some pretty strong 'tude and said \"You guys have to broaden your horizons.\"  They handled it well but seemed slightly put off by it.  The menu options were limited and the prices pretty high.  They wanted $14 for their fish-fry special.  In Madison, a good fish-fry is usually $10.    Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"1 star actually equals zero stars. By far the worst service, kitchen staff I have ever witnessed. 45 minutes later our burgers arrived. Ordered 5 burgers, not one burger was correct. Three separate trips back to the kitchen to fix the burgers and guess what? Still wrong on everyone one!!! Paid for the drinks we had and walked out. I'm sorry but how hard is it to dress a burger reading off of a order slip???!? Ou and by the way there were still empty tables so no excuse for being \"busy\"!  Will not ever ever go back."}
{"text":"My roommate and I went for Wednesday night trivia last night. We showed up early so I could get some food before it started getting busy so I ordered a spinach salad. About an hour later and well into our trivia game, I started feeling weird. On my walk home with my roommate I started getting the worst abdominal pain I ever felt and I was lucky my he was a big guy because I couldn't walk and he had to carry me back to our apartment. I stayed up most of the night because of how sick I was. Never going back there."}
{"text":"If your idea of 'comfort food' is overpriced, gummy, tasteless and fried carbs smothered in cheese and/or bacon, then by all means, help yourself to some diabetes in a bread bowl. I scoured the menu and couldn't find a damn thing that wasn't carb-based or slathered in meat or dairy. I'm not even vegan or vegetarian. I just don't like my food to sit like a rock at the bottom of my stomach for 6+ hours after I eat it.  I've never wanted to stick my finger down my throat so long after eating half an entree, so thanks for getting me to try new things, Buck & Badger."}
{"text":"\"Disappointing\" summarizes our visit to B&B this evening. The food was mediocre at best. My brother-in-law ordered the treetop steak - and received literally just a burger patty. It was hilarious and sad. The only saving grace was Leslie, our excellent server. She's the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. What happened, guys?? You used to be good! The menu is half the size it used to be, and nothing was good. I'm sad."}
{"text":"I read in the Madison magazine that this place has lamb, boar, and bison burgers so I wanted to try it out. I sat at the bar and ordered the moose beer on special. I was disappointed when I received a small menu and only saw beef burgers. So I decided to try the regular burger with goat cheese added. The burger came out a nice size, and the goat cheese on it was about an inch thick and covered the whole burger. I bit into it and was quite impressed. Nice and juicy, just the right amount of pink in it, and nice soft melty cheese. It went perfect with the beer. Definitely recommend, but would be better if they had what I initially came in for."}
{"text":"We went for dinner with a group of friends on a Thursday night - first mistake. Thursday is trivia night and they actually ask you to keep the table talk down so people can hear the trivia questions.   I ordered pumpkin  bisque and it was so thick it was like mashed potatoes. It was so over spiced with Alspice or clove that it was inedible.   My husband ordered the chicken pot pie and got a chicken sandwich. The waitress  took it back and said it would be a few minutes and we gave up after a half an hour and still no pot pie so we left.   The only reason it is getting one star is that I can't give it none.  Our friends weren't really happy either."}
{"text":"Move along folks there's nothing to see here! We went here for takeout during a jazz at 5 concert. The burger was huge and undercooked, it had a burger king like charcoal taste without the beef flavor. I ordered cheddar and they apologized for only having white cheddar! Ah this is Wisconsin.....  The whitefish sandwich we ordered was good. The French fries here were unexplainably greasy and limp. The cole slaw was very vinegar tainted. Overall an unimaginative kitchen in a neighborhood brimming with great alternative choices."}
{"text":"A nice bar and tap featuring north woods themed decor and tons of TV, they serve up the standard Wisconsin bar faire and do a pretty good job on the standard options. Onion rings, Broccoli cheddar Bites, and curds are all great.  I did the original caesar salad with chicken as a wrap- it was good! I would definitely return but I'm going to check out what else this town has to offer first since I wasn't super blown away."}
{"text":"Went to Buck and Badger for dinner last night before a comedy club show. We got there an hour before the show (the comedy club is a minute walk from Buck and Badger). We were seated pretty quickly. The server was very friendly and took our order quickly. Here's where it gets bad. Two of us ordered pasta dishes. The server comes back to inform us that they are out of pasta. We are pretty laid back and understand it was probably a busy for day for them, so we order something else. We waited over 30 minutes for our food to arrive and they only had 2/4 of our orders correct. We were already running low on time and now we had to wait for the correct food. They came back, and had one of the orders wrong AGAIN. Since we didn't have enough time, we decided not to say anything. Here comes the worst part. One of my friends ordered a steak. We are both 90-95% sure that what she received was hamburger shaped like a steak. It was not fleshy, but rather had the texture of ground beef. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tuesday night was my first time eating at Buck and Badger. It was also my last. When I walked in around 9:00PM, I waited patiently by the sign that said \"Please wait to be seated.\" I waited, and waited, and waited. The bartender saw me but ignored me. The hostess was by the ice machine. I came very close to leaving.  Finally she asked if she could help me. I asked if they were still serving dinner. She said yes. Oddly, I then had to ask her to seat me. Apparently she thought I had walked in only to inquire if they were still serving food.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. When I got the \"meal,\" (snack is more accurate), I was surprised by the appearance. The fries were literally dripping in grease. They obviously had not been drained after coming out of the deep fryer. The chicken breast on the sandwich was wafer thin. The tomato slices were thicker. I ate the sandwich in less than five minutes, because there was nothing to it. I ate a few of the fries, but they were far too greasy to eat. The server asked me if I wanted a box for them. I said, \"Most definitely not. The meal was not good at all.\" She just laughed.  It was odd that she never checked on me to see how the meal was, she never offered a refill on my water, and she never brought the check. I finally flagged her down with a $20 bill assuming she would know that I wanted the check. Instead, she just took the money. When she came back with what I had to assume was the correct change, she still didn't bring any receipt. It was clear that customer service was not a part of the deal.  I left the restaurant hungry and disappointed with the poor food and poor service. I could not recommend it under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Ordered the black bean burger and the patty was only warm, the potato salad side is already bad but it was cold so couldn.t taste it on the spot but got diarrhea. Called and complained but received no call backs"}
{"text":"Food is great. Flank steak meatloaf is amazing.  Duck breast is fabulous.   Unfortunately service is not. Two of us ordered soup this evening one came out with a the main course. Couldn't even fit it all on the table. My meal on the other hand never made it out she totally didn't even bring it.  This is 3rd time at his restaurant and service has been less than adequate.  Probably will not be back too many choices of great restaurants on State Street."}
{"text":"Four years later and new management...OMG.  This place is awful.  First of all they revamped the menu and got rid of the tots.  What?  Yeah.  The service at this place has always been underwhelming.  I thought my review would be repetitive if I updated with that.  So I was going to take a pass on it until  the menu came out.    The new menu is a joke.  I am rarely so scathing but avoid this place at all costs.  After sitting at a table, ordering my drink and looking at the menu (about twenty minutes), I am informed that there is no turkey and chicken drumsticks.  What?  Is that not something you say immediately.  So my server, who also knows nothing about beer, tells me they can just put ham or chicken breasts in everything.  Great?  I ordered the Turkey melt with a house salad.  In their defense, the menu did say turkey and cheese on bread.  However, in my head I thought I would get a tomato, a sauce, something....NOPE.    I have had better meals at diners by the side of the highway. I literally received a a sandwich with a dry chicken breast and a piece of cheddar.  This cheddar wasn't even melted.    So I dipped it into the ranch on my salad.  In fact, I took the greens from my salad and put them on my sandwich.  The salad was ok.  Kind of boring, really big carrot chunks.  In Madison, a side salad is never an afterthought.  Alchemy?  Their side salad is always a main event. This place?  Completely forgettable.    I rarely say this - but I will never, ever, ever, be going back again.  What a pity they took away such a good menu.  Oh, also this was at 6pm, the dinner rush on a Saturday night.  Maybe you can't bring back the tots, but for the love of food, please make a good sandwich.    You have too much competition on this strip that if you serve awful food, you will not make it.  As I ate, I longing looked at all the happy people walking by with their Ian's pizza."}
{"text":"French Onion Soup had to have 5 pounds of onions in it! Cheese slopped on it. No bread or crouton to help soak up this mess. Capese salad was lettuce and mozarella slices few tomatoes, fries sprinkled with a lot of cajun spices! Not worth the money or the heartburn!"}
{"text":"I've come here many times over the years most regularly for geeks who drink trivia. While I love the trivia and the atmosphere (although don't like that the trivia master is in a separate room which makes it hard to hear) I have been underwhelmed by both the food and the service the last few times I've come. I know trivia is a busier time but we often went long stretches of time with empty beer glasses and no check in. The cheese curds are way too greasy and the torts I got last time was only ok. It was also very spicy but gave no indication! The fries are interesting. I like the seasoning but it was way too thick on many of the fries.  I'm sure I'll be back for trivia but will probably just stick to drinks in the future."}
{"text":"The Buck & Badger won me over a bit since their breading on chicken is gluten free (that's a rarity for us GF people). The service was okay, but a bit over priced. I got a salad, and there wasn't much chicken on it.  My husband got their wings, and said they were some of the worst he ever had. The rest of the table seemed to enjoy their meal.  We went at lunch in the summer so we easily grabbed a table outside. It was difficult to get more drinks, condiments and the check. We would have appreciated more attentive service."}
{"text":"Great bartenders but the food was ill prepared.  I got the steak sandwich and ordered it medium and received it was pretty much rare with the bread covered in blood."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends. The menu is small. I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. The burger was a bit small (too much bun) and was rather pink, although I had ordered it medium-well. The menu also stated that the sandwiches came with a side and a pickle, but the pickle turned out to be two small pickle slices. The fries were good, nothing special.  My friends ordered the mac n cheese bake, which they seemed to enjoy, and a BLT, which seemed to be just ok.  The service wasn't great. The waitress brought the wrong meal to one of us. I have a feeling she was new though, as she was flustered by some of our questions about menu/payment, so perhaps it isn't totally fair.  I have heard this place is fun for trivia, but I probably wouldn't return for anything but to check that event out."}
{"text":"Buck and Badger, I don't think I've ever wanted to like a bar/restaurant as much as you. I've given you multiple chances now, and you have only gotten worse. You're like perfect match on Tinder. You sound incredible, look incredible, but when we meet I find out you're 45, unemployed, and living with mom.  My friends and I have been frequenting Buck & Badger for Geeks Who Drink trivia. Honestly, if they didn't host pub trivia I would never go here.  + Decent beer and cocktail selection + Has trivia  - Poor wine selection - Food is underwhelming and overpriced - Poor \"snack\" food selection for a bar that hosts trivia - Service is slow, unreliable, and rude  The bar has 24 rotating taps so if you enjoy a good brew, you can't really go wrong. The selection was diverse too for those with particular taste in beer. On Thursdays you can nab a Moose Drool for $3, not a bad deal. Good luck, getting more than one due to service issues.  I was disappointed by the selection of appetizers, considering we arrived around 8 pm just for drinks, a snack, and trivia. For a pub that hosts trivia two nights a week, the appetizer/snack selection was lacking. We ordered both the cheese curds and bacon cheddar fries. The cheese curds were actually cheese fritters, and there were only 6 on the plate. I was disappointed by the number served in the order, and the sauce tasted like a simple dressing out of a bottle.   The bacon cheddar fries (not pictured) had a little too much salt on them between all of the ingredients and seasoning on top of it. They definitely could have used more acid to balance the flavor out. The cheese was shredded and melted on top. By the time it had reached the table, the cheese was cool and crusty. It's also worth noting that the bacon cheddar fries are not on the menu. We put in a special request for them. The normal fries are $3.50, and we were charged $9.50 for this special request. I don't think we ate $6 worth of bacon and cheese...  So far my run in with the service at Buck & Badger has been outrageous and beyond acceptable. On our first visit, the server decided start an argument with us when over hearing our conversation about Spotted Cow, and claimed it was a Hefeweizen. I don't care that the server believes the beer is something that it isn't, but she got very snippy when I was discussing it with the table and called it a cream ale. That same night, we specifically asked for ketchup twice and it never showed up over a 2 hour period.  On a subsequent visit, everyone placed their first drink order and a water pitcher with cups was left at the table. The server never came back to ask how things were or to ask about a second round. We were there for trivia, that means at least 2.5 hours sitting. I had to flag her down to get a 2nd Moose Drool. Eventually the server showed up when 2 full rounds of trivia remain and tries to talk to us while trivia questions are actively being asked. I ask her to come back, and she comes back in 5 minutes with the checks for some reason. One person at the table asked for another drink, and she leaves half the checks on the table. The drink never showed up and about 30 minutes later a different server comes by with the rest of the checks and a small plate of burnt cookies.  I don't even know what to say. I want to love this bar. In no way were we rude to the servers, but the service was just abysmal. Other reviewers seem to have had similar experiences too.  Sorry Buck & Badger, we could have had something really special together. You have broken my heart."}
{"text":"Popped in here on a Thursday night to take advantage of some trivia (they also offer it on Tuesdays). The leader is really great and makes it a lot of fun. The bar itself is really well-decorated, maintaining the theme of a lodge without being too kitschy.   There isn't a lot of seating in the bar, so if you want to have a seat and a table for your game, make sure you arrive early. It's literally a packed house. But, given that, the bartender does an excellent job of managing the crowd and getting beers to guests in rapid time. The beer selection is good, with a ton of local beers (24 on tap) that rotate regularly.   We didn't eat, so I can't comment on the food, but if nothing else, stop in to take advantage of trivia and maybe win yourself some free beer!"}
{"text":"Buck and Badger is my go-to place for trivia which they host with Geeks Who Drink on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They tend to have some specials for beer which is great: on Tuesdays a tallboy of PBR is $2.50 and they typically have one draft on special for $3.   The food menu is fairly short, and seems to change somewhat often. For awhile they had decent chicken wings, replaced them with turkey wings, then brought chicken wings back to the menu (thank goodness!). My favorite meal has been the sweet potato crusted chicken sandwich which has a nice crunchiness to it without feeling totally disgusting and fried.  I had high hopes for the Fried Pickles appetizer, but was burned, literally. The pickles are fried in spears, and after many mouth burns, I found that they seem to never cool off. Cutting up the spears wasn't really an option without losing the breading in the process. Lesson learned.  Service is fine, not fast by any means, but they get the job done. The ladies restroom has two stalls, one of which always seems to be out of order in some way. This could be due to their sharing bathroom space with the Ivory Room which sees a lot of rowdy weekend traffic.  Overall, Buck and Badger's atmosphere is cute and cozy, and I love sitting near the fireplace in the wintertime. Give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"I always get wary when a restaurant tries to hard to push a theme.  In this case, Buck and Badger is supposed to resemble an \"Up North\" restaurant with a stuffed moosehead (fake me thinks) and a log cabin motif. Nevertheless, I thought to give it a whirl as we biked down State Street on one of the first nice days of Spring.  The menu is typical American fare-wings, some salads, hamburgers made from the various animals (cow, boar, lamb, bison), and entrees.  I opted for the Duck Salad (no tomatoes)  while my 9 year old daughter went with the children's Mac and Cheese.   The meal took a tad bit long to come out with our waiter coming out to inform us they made the salad with the tomatoes and were making me a new one.  I was happy to hear that until the second attempt at the salad came out.  Evidently, when I requested no tomatoes, the cook also thought Ihe/she should include any other vegetable-it was missing the red peppers, onions, and celery that the menu described  While the duck was well prepared and the apple cider vinaigrette adding a nice acid to cut through the richness of the duck, the salad lacked anything crunchy and therefore was forgettable.    My daughter's mac and cheese was generous in size and I appreciated the fact that the sauce was homemade and well balanced.  Good but nothing to come back for.  Buck and Badger would do better if it lessened the schtick around the Northwoods (really, the kid's menu item comes with an antler crown which basically guarantees a therapy visit or two when they get older from the humiliation), reduced the size of their menu, and focused on delivering well executed meals.  While I would say that the restaurant won't be around long due to the amount of nearby competition (The Fountain, Coopers, etc), they probably will as the owner also owns the Capitol Tap Haus (yawn) and the Ivory Room (license to print money)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times on Trivia night on Thursday. Geeks Who Drink is a very fun group, I always have a blast. My choice of beer: Moose Drool. Yum, and only $3 on Thursday. I'm a little biased because I love stout and Dark Ales, so drink with discretion.   Service is amazing. So on top of their game, and constantly replenished us with beer when I asked. They're also pretty nice, which is always a plus.  The space is too small for the events they advertise! Definitely not enough space to hold many groups of people who aren't willing to share chairs. On any other night if you're coming in and out, the place is more than accommodating; but on a busy night when people are trying to sit, eat, and socialize? No.   Overall, very willing to come back to be impressed. The fries didn't impress me, so I'm hoping to come back for a meal."}
{"text":"To be honest, bordering on a one after my last few visits. Shortly after my previous update the menu was overhauled and the staff appears to have been purged. The one item I enjoyed from the previous iteration had been wiped out, but that's life. My boyfriend and I decided to split the Fireside Nacho Fries shortly after the switch, and while they sounded good on paper (thick home fries, chopped pork, cheese, salsa, sour cream) it was one of the worst things I've been served in Madison. The fries were mushy, the pork stringy and flavorless, and everything was wet due to the watery tomatoes and salsa. After that I gave up on food, which is fine. I come for the trivia and to occasionally enjoy an adult beverage, and since trivia doesn't start until 8:30 I have more than enough time to make dinner before.   Speaking of adult beverages, on my most recent trivia trip I saw they had Surly Horchata on nitro. It sounded delicious and I was psyched to try it. The only problem is that in the two and half hours I was there I got no service. Someone stopped by to drop off a plate that my friend ordered from the bar when he arrived before us, but after setting it down they turned and left immediately. No one came to get us water, no one came so we could order drinks, and the empty plate sat there untouched for about two hours on the edge of the table. There were two servers in the dining room and both acted like our table didn't exist. I could have gotten up and ordered from the bar, but literally every other table was getting table service and I am hopelessly optimistic and thought surely, if nothing else, someone would come to clear the dirty plate. I was wrong.   Two and a half hours of sitting there without being checked on once is inexcusable.   The only reason I'm giving them a two instead of a one is that they do have a solid tap list and it feels disingenuous to continue to show up weekly while saying \"methinks not.\" The great trivia host will keep me coming back, but if he ever moves on I will, too."}
{"text":"Ordered two Philly cheese steak sandwiches with fries. The waitress brought one sandwich with *sweet potato fries* ($2 extra according to the menu) and one fish fry. We sent the latter back and split the sandwich while we waited for the other one. Have you ever heard a cheese steak sandwich loaded with jalapenos? My companion cannot tolerate hot food, but jalapenos just don't belong on a cheese steak sandwich. Clearly the kitchen screwed up. So that sandwich was a disaster. Finally the second sandwich came, sans jalapenos. It was average. Then the waitress tried to charge us the extra $$ for the sweet potato fries we didn't order. She took that off the bill, along with one of the sandwiches. Fair enough. But this place is lame. Never again."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison for the first time and my husband and I were looking for a quick bite near our hotel when we got in. Stopped by this place since we heard they have trivia on Thursday nights, and had a great time.  It was a little loud since the game was on - and the Badgers won, go Badgers! - so I doubt it's that loud on a regular basis. The food was delicious, environment was fun and relaxed, and their beer selection was excellent. Especially for people looking to try Wisconsin beer. I mean, how can you go wrong with Spotted Cow?  Trivia was great as well. Our server was a little slow, but again with the game on so I don't blame him. Had a great time our first night in town."}
{"text":"We went here for trivia and while it's a nice space with a good tap list, oh my god the food. How do you screw up frying? I've had better fast food cheese curds, and better store-brand ranch dressing than whatever they gave us. Service was friendly but a bit scattered - it wouldn't be a dealbreaker but Jesus that food was AWFUL. We walked out glad we hadn't placed well in trivia because the prizes were gift cards and that would mean we'd have to come back. Maybe we still will, because trivia was fun, but I'm not touching their food."}
{"text":"I'm more confused than anything. I used to walk by this place all the time and see people eating these huge plates of what looked like pretty heavy foods--big platters heaped with sides. I also see reviews that mentioning things that at least sound interesting: boar burgers, whitefish hoagies, etc.   When I went today I was kind of surprised to see an incredibly limited and boring menu--some burgers, chicken sandwiches, fried apps-- and food that was served in red plastic baskets with no sides or garnishes (or the pickle listed on the menu).  The food was ok. We ordered burgers and chicken sandwiches. None were very large or particularly tasty; sautéed mushrooms were burnt and the \"large\" side of fries was ludicrously undersized and overpriced. What we ate would be decent in a dive bar, but seemed underwhelming  in a place where they clearly spent so much money and effort on decor.   Service was friendly but extremely slow. Despite the overpriced fries, the total damage ($37 for four) was pretty low. I can't imagine going back, though, nor can I understand the appeal of this place."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming food! I ordered a large chili and they brought me out an 8oz cup for $7.70. I asked to make sure this was their large and the server assured me that it was. What is there small? A shooter glass full? Unbelievable! I can't believe anybody would eat here."}
{"text":"Although Buck and Badger has a whole section on their menu devoted to delicious looking meat burgers, I went against conventional wisdom and ordered their Veggie Burger. What the what?? I promise you it's good. The grilled portabella topped with grilled peppers and provolone cheese tastes almost like meat, if not better. Buck and Badger also has some really great cocktails (The One that Got Away, which is Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey with root beer, is tasty) as well as a large selection of beer. They also host Geeks Who Drink Trivia on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Took 40 minutes for our order. For a burger & salad. Salad was a bowl of spinach and endive with a couple diced tomatoes. Can you skimp any more?!  Oh wait, yes you can. You have to buy the salad dressing separate. Tack on $.50. Cookies were a nice touch but rather insulting when they're just shy of burned. Could have used them for hockey pucks. Speakers were so loud my seat vibrated. Don't even think about having a conversation. All in all not a good experience. Won't be back and I don't recommend it for you.  Plenty of other great restaurants in the area. I'll be sticking with The Old Fashioned from now on. Get your act together, Bucks."}
{"text":"I like the food here. I like sitting outside when it's nice out and sitting inside for the cozy cabin interior during winter. I like coming here at night and grabbing a drink to waive my cover for the piano bar. I like the convenience of this place.  Sure, the food isn't the best or most unique in Madison, but it's bar food. I think Buck & Badger is at least 3.5 stars and will give the benefit of the doubt since we can't do half stars on yelp!"}
{"text":"I only came here for drinks. Their specials are inexpensive and pretty good. Save your receipt and you can use it instead of paying cover charge to enter ivory."}
{"text":"I should've listened to Emigh C. below. The food was expensive, not impressive at all and just sat in my stomach. There are lots of amazing and better priced restaurants nearby (Ian's for example)!"}
{"text":"Trivia tuesday!!! What a fun time testing our trivia skills, enjoy a couple of appetizers,  and beer. They have a good selection of beer on draft abd I believe have bottle beer too. Definitely support local wisconsin beer!   Our bartender was super friendly, he even bring us cookies during trivia."}
{"text":"We only stopped in here for drinks but we enjoyed it!  We had just gotten to town and it was a good happy hour spot before dinner.  Loved the rustic/outdoors vibe!  Definitely took pictures with one of the bear heads on the wall.   Had a good beer selection and service was good.  Our bartender was really nice and gave us some tips for navigating a football saturday the following day as visiting fans."}
{"text":"Walking by on a foggy and drizzly Monday night, and the beautiful, roaring fire caught our eyes. My beautiful date and I went in, and were seated pretty quickly.  Bill took care of us, and was super friendly.  Turns out he was manager that evening.  He gave us options for specials, and we got a couple glasses of (really tasty!) wine. I got a Pinot and she got a Riesling. They had run out of the sweet potato au gratin side dish her and I both wanted, and although they clearly made a good effort to find substitutions, we gladly chose to get side salads instead. The dressing for those had this smokey, bacon vinaigrette dressing that was perhaps the best dressing I've ever had (no joke).  Main dish was the roasted chicken and carrots that really tasted perfect. My date and I continued great conversation after our food was done, and Bill surprised us by bringing complimentary hot toddy's (which were also amazing). We continued to talk sitting by that fireplace sipping our drinks, but what we didn't realize until later was that nobody else was there but us, and they were technically closed.  He never asked us to leave or anything, but instead brought us drinks for free.  A+!"}
{"text":"We went to Buck & Badger last night with friends for dinner (6pm on a Saturday night).  When we arrived, there is a hostess stand right inside the front door with the usual \"please wait to be seated\" sign.  So we waited.....and waited...and waited.  No hostess appeared.  Two groups of people came in behind us and joined the wait for the elusive hostess.  The bar area was crowded and the bartenders definitely noticed the large crowd waiting to be seated, but made no move to summon a hostess.  Finally, our friends texted us to let us know they were already at a table (they had asked the hostess to let us know, but since she had disappeared, we didn't get the message).  So we went to sit down- I never saw the groups behind us come into the dining room, so I am guessing they got fed up waiting and left.   Our waitress was very pleasant and friendly and brought us our drinks right away.  As a previous poster mentioned, the beer came in cans, even though there is a full bar with plenty of beer on tap.  Two of us ordered the bison burger, which was just ok- it was pretty small (the waitress said it was 1/3 lb, but it seemed smaller) and definitely NOT worth the $11 price, especially considering that sides are not included and cost extra.  The regular french fries were pretty lackluster- maybe a step up from McDonald's fries, and the sweet potato fries were soggy.  My fiance said the whitefish hoagie was nothing special and our friend who had the french fried cheese said it was not very good.  There were some decent parts of the meal, our friends noted that the twice baked potato and french onion soup were delicious.  At the end of the meal we were given a plate of chocolate chip cookies, which were ok, but they were basically just mass produced cookies that had been warmed in the microwave to make them seem fresh-baked.  I would much rather they forget the cookies and just focus on serving better food.  Overall, we felt like the food was bland and very overpriced, and while our waitress was ok, the service in general was pretty poor.    We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Good food but not a great value. A little pricey. I liked the bison burger and the sweet potato fries. But there are better options food-wise on State."}
{"text":"The waiter came to take our order outside and I'm pretty positive that he was stoned out of his mind. He kept repeating himself and asked us what we wanted to drink multiple times. when we said we needed a few minutes to order food, but asked to start with bloody Mary's, the dude never came back. I'm still in utter disbelief that we just sat there for over twenty minutes. Ended up walking out..,"}
{"text":"Great Food!! Outdoor seating right on State Street. Adorable Wait Staff ! Have the Cheese Curd Fritters! Rockin!!"}
{"text":"Food here is always excellent. Place is very up northy. The Boar Burger is definitely one of the best out there, and the apple cider glazed carrots are delicious. If you're up for something a bit different, definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is just not good. They recently \"updated\" their menu which I think means they just cut it in half. The food here is not very good, the selection is tiny, and in my experience, we've had to send back food about 40% of the time (wrong orders, cold wings, undercooked burgers).  This place gets one star for serving alcohol, and one star for having a fireplace. And that's about it."}
{"text":"Slow, confused service and expensive, below average food make this place a 2 star if not 1. Once again Yelpers got it mostly right. We would have avoided but we were going to a show with a 5 year old and American food with a more casual atmosphere was what we needed. Wish I would've taken the time to find something better.  The food is expensive for what it is. The burger was just a plain burger and you had to add everything for extra if you wanted more toppings, .75 for cheese and $1.75 for things like bacon, mushrooms, sauteed onions, fried egg, etc. $1.75?!? That's crazy expensive, especially for the quality.  When we got there the place was empty except for 2 tables. It took forever to get water and even longer to get drinks we ordered. My dad's first beer was ice cold, which is not how it should be served if you know anything about beer. We had to flag down the waitress for a second round. The place started to fill up, several tables that sat after us were able to order their food before us. We finally were able to order food. All of our order were wrong to some extent. I had cheese on my burger, it was fine I didn't originally order with cheese because of the ridiculous up charge. I barely got any mushrooms. I was asked how I wanted my burger cooked, not sure why since it was a puney frozen 1/4th lbs thing. My dad's burger had tomato when he asked for no tomato. My son who has dairy allergy received a burger with a bun spread with butter. We had just asked for a burger no bun. This seemed confusing to the waitress, she kept asking \"so no bun?\" The salad was plentiful but way too much diced tomatoes and the ranch dressing was translucent and gelatin like. Looking around all other tables were waiting around, looking for their server trying to order their food, get water, or pretty much any type of service.  The server was nice but not competent and my old fashioned was decent, the only reason I'm giving it a 2 not a 1. But we will definitely not be back here."}
{"text":"Visited this location a couple of weeks ago, as well as several times in the past. In general, I've never had any complaints. The food is tasty, the service is good, the beer selection is plentiful.  This most recent visit, however, left me with mixed feelings.   First issue: One of my most FAVORITE menu items was removed from the menu some time ago. It happens, I get it. I was bummed, but not upset. What did upset me, however, is that still to this day, months and months after the removal of said item, the Facebook page still shows a menu that includes the item. I thought, oh great, it's back! But sadly, no.. I asked if it could be made by request and they said no to that as well. Booo.   Second: I was with a large group of about 10 folks. One member of the party had called ahead to let them know we were coming in and to make a reservation. \"Sure, come on in! Great!\" They said. What they didn't say was that it was Trivia Night that evening and that while we enjoyed our meal together, we would suddenly be surrounded by campus college kids who were there for drinks and games. That alone wasn't too bad, but when it was time to hear the answers everyone in the room got real quiet and gave us dirty looks for trying to have a normal conversation. I really wish we would have been informed when we called in.   Last: The place was SWAMPED and there was ONE server in our whole section. I don't blame her at all for the slow, forgetful (one person didn't get their entree) and disappointing service. Management should have had more than one server on with how busy it was.   So, in conclusion, I DO really like this restaurant. The food IS good. The service IS [usually] good. Just a few things that could be improved upon for a better experience."}
{"text":"Ever met a chicken wing you couldn't eat? Neither had I until ordering the jerk chicken wings here. I choked a few down, but they were basically inedible. Plenty of places nearby to try, not stopping here again."}
{"text":"Well- every place screws up. Sometimes monumentally. Out mid afternoon snack break during the Art Fair On The Square turned into a dilemma. No dilemma on tip- just whether we stay to pay. Slowwwwwww. Everything. First bad experience here- but extraordinarily bad- if kitchen staff calls in sick on a nice Saturday- I would call it quitting or ask for a doctors note to explain the tragedy. Bottle flue or sunshine love aren't suckness- but will cost this place my business. I bet a rain day would have cured the illness- or a policy that requires appropriate request off policy."}
