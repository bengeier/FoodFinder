{"text":"I stopped in here last week while visiting a service.

It was extremely busy and they had a limited menu (apparently only during service times).
The staff was friendly and helpful, and agreed the menu could use a face lift.

I got a drip coffee, which was very good. The food was good, but nothing spectacular.  The atmosphere was awful, screaming children, complaining patrons and not a seat to be had. 

I asked a cashier in the gift store if it was always like this, and her reply was \"the cafe was very poorly designed and is unable to handle the volume\". 

I tried to find a table for myself and two friends, and was essentially scorned for taking a table that was reserved.

I might try this coffee shop during the week, only because the drip coffee was so darn good!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and the staff is great! Can get a bit busy on Sundays (to be expected) so just be prepared for a little wait, but you will not regret the food!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food.  Great variety. Love the sandwiches and flatbread. 

It's a great midweek escape. It can get a little noisy when it's busy. But there is plenty of outside seating if you need it a little quieter."}
{"text":"I love this place! The coffee is great! The food is delicious. To top things off there's even a bookstore!!!! Love everything about this and will keep going back!!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale Bible Church's new cafe is a hit! 

Great feel with seating for everyone, including within the in-cafe library. I had a smoothy with a green tea base which was awesome! Sandwich and coffee to round it out. All high quality at a great price. Great place to stop by just to get some work done, or meet with friends. 

Hours are good and free wifi!"}
{"text":"This cafe/bookstore is a perfect alternative to the busy atmosphere of surrounding coffee shops. It has a very personal feel and the staff are wonderful. The drinks and food are very good quality and I have yet to try something I didn't like. Their house brew coffee is very good and they have soy and almond milk as alternatives to dairy. I love how it is also a bookstore; I can shop and grab my coffee all at once and the prices are unbeatable. Next time you're out and about and need a coffee or quick bite to eat make sure to pop in, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, never disappointed, the menu has lots of good choices, the ice tea is awesome. Definitely worth trying for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"New to the cafe scene, yet its taken off on the right foot."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Good coffee. Light meals. Excellent wifi.

If you need a place to meet or just a place to read & relax this would be a great option.  Bigger than most coffee shops.  Great coffee, tea, sandwiches, salads and even soup.  This morning I \"tested\" out the cinnamon pecan roll...you are welcome.  It passed the test.  They also have breakfast deliciousness."}
