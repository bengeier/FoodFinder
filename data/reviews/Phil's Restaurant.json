{"text":"Phil's is one of those places I've eaten at since I was knee high, in fact it's a place that my father ate at since he was knee high.

It's a good place to go for brunch, lunch, dinner as long as you like breakfast, and if you are like me breakfast is the staple meal anytime of the day.  We've been to Phil's on 16th Avenue at least 4 times in the last 6 months and we've always had good service and dependable food.  There is nothing too fancy on the menu here, but just your typical American style meals with a good selection of options.  The portions are always reasonably sized and the meals are quite affordable.

You aren't going to Phil's for the ambiance - unless of course you like that 80/90's decor - but rather as a good place to take anyone from your kid's to your grandparents; it is very, very family friendly.

And even though there are 6 Phil's restaurants don't be fooled into thinking this is a chain like that big American down the street (rhymes with Benny's).  It's Alberta owned  and a great place to eat whether you are in Red Deer, Banff or any of the quadrants in Calgary."}
{"text":"I come here every so often with my family, this Sunday morning we went for brunch we had a table for 5 and we waiting to be seated this lady (bun with glasses large gauges and piercings) calls us and I start getting up And she hauls ass over to me and is like \"woah woah there calm down calm down \" and proceed to keep repeating that until she either realized how incredibly rude she was being or decided to do something more productive that belittle a customer like that. She told us the table would be a couple of minutes and walked away after treating me like a mentally challenged individual and talking down to me, that kind of disrespect put me off my appetite a bit but after getting past the incredibly rude service at the front door everything was what you could expect from Phil's , id happily come back given I'm treated with some decency and care when I walk in the door as opposed to some sort of slow imbecile. Overall if you're looking for brunch Phil's is fine but if the lady I described is working be prepared to have to wait for permission to stand up before you're seated."}
{"text":"The Eggs Benny is excellent. The service is always amazingly fast and friendly. 

A great spot for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Met a couple friends here over the weekend. This is their go-to breakfast joint so they already knew what they were getting, I glanced over the menu and settled on eggs benny with their shredded hashbrowns.

We had a huge booth to ourselves so all our dishes, glasses and the many, many condiments they brought to our table weren't cramped on a tiny table.

My eggs were pretty good, the pea meal back bacon, yolky egg and hollandaise were a nice mix. I wish my hashbrowns were a bit crispier though. I snagged a few of the cubed hashbrowns off my GF's plate and liked those a lot better.

I've been told normally this place is packed (mostly by early bird seniors) but with it being Stampede week, it wasn't so bad.

It's pretty convenient location, reasonably priced and the food's decent."}
{"text":"Awesome. Came here on the recommendations of friends and this place does not disappoint. Folks I know rave about the chubbies, the first time I went I had to try them. Pretty yummy - I prefer the beef ones.

This place is a perfect all day breakfast joint.  Awesome service and all your favourites on the menu - with a few extras.  I like that they offer a choice of hash browns - I'm down with their shredded ones. They rule.  Also, if you are a coffee drinker this place gives you a carafe for your table so you never have to worry about getting a top up.

The service here is bang on, food comes out quick and though this place is always bustling I've never had to wait for a table. Ideal place for mopping up the remains of a late night with eggs."}
{"text":"I noticed this place always seemed to do good business, thats usually a good sign. Service was good. Great coffe. I had travelers breakfast with beef chubbies and eggs over medium.  It's hard to find a place that can do over medium eggs properly without burning them. These were done perfectly. Personally I did not enjoy the beef chubbies, you might. Look forward to trying them for dinner."}
{"text":"This place was near my hotel so I came here for breakfast before hitting the road. Was happy to see they had a version of heuevos rancheros on the menu. Although they called it eggs rancheros so I almost missed it. Probably call it eggs rancheros so it sounds less foreign. But they did not want to go all the way and just call them ranch eggs. Anyway whatever it was called was good. Only complaint is it did not come with any meat. So I added some sausage bites.  Which made the whole meal too much and too expensive. Next time I will leave off the sausage."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast this morning!  Thought we would give Phil's another chance... The last time we went I had the eggs Benny and it was terrible!  This time I thought I would go a completely different taste and ordered the Belgian Waffle with strawberries and cream.  My husband ordered the Spanish omelette.  We got there shortly after 8am to beat the rush they seem to get. The service was definitely good, our server was very friendly. The food, again, wasn't the best!  My waffle was very bland and dry!  The strawberries were still half frozen and did nothing to make it better!  I was only able to choke down half of it!  My husbands Spanish omelette was just ok... After heavily seasoning it with salt and pepper, it was much better!  You had the choice of either pancakes with it or hash browns and toast.  He chose the pancakes!   In my  opinion the pancakes should have been served on a separate plate as they ended up with salsa on them.  
I would give the service 5 stars, however the food would only get a 1 or a 2.  When we left I said to my hubby, \"please don't bring me here again!  I don't like the food here!\"  I would rather go to Denny's"}
{"text":"Breakfast Served All Day!  Sweet!  Gonna get me a big 'ole omelet with spicy sausage, fresh salsa, cheddar, jack and jalapenos...uuhhh, nope, eh, this is Canada.  Still too far from the southern immigration forces that inevitably influence a casual dining menu.  Bland is the word for the food here...

Not that I'm complaining.  But Phil's presented a breakfast pretty much the same as what you would get at Sambo's, Denny's, Perko's, or Shari's 30 years ago.  Basic fare, prepared in an unoffensive way.  

They had these round sausage things called Chubbies.  I always though a \"Chubby\" was an erection in 8th grade home room.  Anyway, the Chubbies here were flaccid pucks of either Chorizo or Sausage.  I had the Chorizo and it was OK.  More Spanish spiced than Mexican.  

I will say this, Phil's had a genuine gesture of hospitality from the wait staff.  Not that fake corporate insincere kindness you get across the street at Denny's. The waitress and cashier treated me in the same way a nurse would if I was recovering from a gunshot room in intensive care.  Strange.  Must of known I was an American."}
{"text":"*Update: Sadly this place just lost some stars in my book because the Management decided to cheap out and no longer off phone orders for take out. The reason was that people weren't showing up for their food, however it's a very cheap tactic that reflects badly on this organization 

Old review: Great food, Great Staff/service, Great Prices. Our server was a doll. Left extremely happy."}
{"text":"This is a reliable American-style breakfast restaurant. Nothing fancy, but the pancakes and pork chubbies are delicious, and prices are reasonable. A perfect spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you keep coming back to, especially if you were born and raised in Calgary. I gave it 5 stars because of their fast and friendly service, the wide variety of dining options available (including all-day breakfast,) great parking, AND their prices are excellent for the huge portions you get. My only complaint is that they need to change their coffee supplier; pretty consistently vile coffee, to be honest. But I'm not going there just to drink coffee anyways, all I'm saying is that's the one thing they could improve upon."}
{"text":"I had the kids for the night and decided nothing hits the spots like a breakfast for supper. Our server was great and although she made a small ordering mistake the rest of the meal was spot on. Exactly what you expect from a breakfast dinner. We had a tonne of pancakes, a few omelettes, and a couple orders of hash browns. That may sound like a lot of food but keep in mind I have 4 kids, all of which love to eat! 

We left nearly full without spending too much which is always hard on the nights I have the kids. The rest of the serving team were helpful as well and I am sure the next time I am craving pancakes for supper I will return."}
{"text":"Well, that was my last time at Phil's.

After frequenting Phil's for over 10 years, I think we need to part ways. Today my husband and I went to Phil's for a nice, dependable Sunday breakfast and were shocked by our server.

After the server brought our order to the table, we brought to her attention (in a friendly manner) that items were missed off of our order. She got very defensive. She was so agitated by us bringing up our missing items, that we were honestly hesitant to bring up the fact that the pork chubbies seemed a little under cooked. (Scared, really)

Luckily someone else stepped in and finished serving us halfway through our breakfast. This person was friendly and did not take it personally when we asked if the meat could be cooked a bit longer. 

It's too bad that this situation happened, but there are way too many breakfast/brunch places in Calgary these days to gamble on having to deal with defensive, impolite servers first thing in the morning. 

Next time we're skipping Phil's and going to OEB (yum!) or Kensington Pub (also yum!)"}
{"text":"Went to Phil's for the first time on a Monday for brunch with two friends. They are avid fans of Phil's (mostly because they grew up on this place during their childhood) so they had nothing but enthusiasm borderline obsession for this place. Right away, this place reminded me of Denny's (a slightly better version of it). Place was packed but we luckily got a seat without having to wait.

The service here is great and the waitress we had was very friendly and accommodating. She let us substitute several items which was great. For food, this is what we had:

- 2x cokes ($2-3/each) - you get unlimited refills for all you coke-aholics
- Special of the day ($10) and side order of hash browns ($3)
- Egg white omelette with 3 mini waffles (approx. $10-12)
- Mixed Special ($12) - 2 pork chubbies, 2 chicken chubbies (subbed for this instead of the beef ones), 3 mini waffles (subbed out pancakes), bacon and over easy eggs. Waffles were good, chubbies decent but a bit on the greasy side.

Overall, I thought the food was pretty average but the company was good. I'm not a much of a brunch guy so maybe that is why but I'm 100% sure you can find tastier options in Calgary. Decent but nothing mind blowing here. Must be why there was so many old folks here (haha)."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast for the first, and last, time this past Saturday.  Both my daughter and I were extremely disappointed with our meals.  Her eggs for her Eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly but the awful \"what they call Hollandaise Sauce\" completely ruined it.  Never had we ever seen such anemic looking hollandaise sauce and it had no flavour at all.  My West Coast omelette can only be described as a hot mess.  The ingredients sounded interesting but the actual dish was unappealing and goopy.   The hash browns were kind of mushy.  We did love that coffee and tea are served in good sized carafes and the server was efficient and personable."}
{"text":"Food was good and reasonably priced
Robin good service
Nothing fancy, does the trick

Damn app won't post until I put in filler"}
