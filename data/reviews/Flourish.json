{"text":"Flourish is a nice addition to the local restaurant scene. It has spectacular views of the valley and has the food to back up the view. 

We arrived for a late lunch. The dining area isn't the biggest but was quite comfortable and the noise level was acceptable. The food was very good. I highly recommend the roasted brussel sprouts small plate. I know, I know... Brussel Sprouts? Really, they were amazing. Oven roasted with a hint of sweetness, shaved garlic and a sprinkling of (I think) goat cheese. Fabulous flavor. 

Since the sandwiches are kind of large we split an avocado BLT. Tasty but messy. Exceptional bacon though. As others have stated, the thin cut French fries were excellent. Splitting the sprouts and the sandwich between two people made for a great lunch. Add a glass of prosecco and you have a fine meal."}
{"text":"Very limited overpriced lunch menu, we were charged $14.00 each for a horrible kale salad,I was told the best thing the had on the menu is a hamburger."}
{"text":"Ver y good and savoury italian like dishes. I really liked their baked gnocci with arugula."}
{"text":"First the great: food and views! The views are amazing and the food is excellent! We started with the crispy Brussels Sprouts. I enjoy them every time that we go. Perfectly crisp and deliciously seasoned. For my entree, I enjoyed the lamb chops. Two huge, tender lamb chops -- perfectly cooked and served with gnocchi and crimini mushrooms and arugula. My husband had the scallops served with wheat berry risotto and multi-colored cauliflower. I don't care for scallops, but the risotto and cauliflower were fantastic! And he loved the scallops. 

Mediocre: The service. The waiters assistant tried three times to take the Brussels sprouts. After the first time that I said that we were still enjoying it, I thought that she might wait until we had actually finished. But, she came back and tried again, ... and again before we finished. I felt as though we were being rushed out.

The bad: We have a Preferred Restaurants card. Knowing that the restaurant had changed names, we checked before making a reservation to ensure that the card would still be accepted. We were told that the conditions had changed, and that the card was now only valid Monday through Wednesday. So, we made a reservation for a Tuesday evening. We tried to give the server the card and were told \"we don't take that\". When we explained that we had inquired in advance, she reluctantly said that she would check. She quickly returned to tell us that no, the card was no longer accepted. 

It is a shame that the service and attitude are do not live up to the quality of the food and the magnificent views"}
{"text":"Had the Renaissance cocktail and an Old Fashioned.  They need a new bartender.  Food just okay.  Way too overpriced for quality of food and drink.  I'd go back to the drawing board and start over as it is a shame that what's served spoils the view!"}
{"text":"Had a marvelous Sunday brunch on the patio! Food was excellent; scenery is outstanding. Will definitely do this again!"}
{"text":"New restaurant, Flourish, was a huge disappointment.  Alchemy menu and service were far better.  Worst service ever today!  Table of four.  Took at least 30 minutes for our server to take our orders, then 50 min more before we got our food.  We only got served because my husband asked. And 2 of the 4 entrees were barely luke warm...sitting out for 20 minutes or more?  We will not return!  On- line menu had appealing lunch choices, actual menu much more limited."}
{"text":"Flourish just opened a few weeks ago at the newly updated CopperWynd Resort and it is stunning!  I walked in the lobby of what was a lovely but someone dated facility a few months ago to a transformed desert modern living room like lobby and completely open dining room. The sun was setting and they had all of the sliding glass doors open and you felt like you were in a high end estate overlooking your own private view of Four Peaks and on cue the famous Fountain of Fountain Hills went off.  There were plenty of seating options but we sat at the gorgeous communal high top table and took in the views. The food was delicious. I had the salmon and my date had the steak and both were over the top. They have a \"healthy fresh\" concept that made you feel like you were eating healthy but still being catered to in a high end restaurant. They added beer on tap when they renovated the restaurant and had some fun selections (yes-we had Four Peaks while looking at the Four Peaks) and the Restaurant GM Charlie was super knowledgable and made us a craft cocktail with watermelon which was out of this world. I would highly recommend. We went for dinner but I think it would be fun to go back for happy hour and sit on the high tops on their outdoor patio or snag one of the living room areas with friends for drinks. Views. Views. Views."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the patio has the best view I think I've ever seen at a restaurant. The portions were respectable for the type of restaurant that it is. My only fix for them would be the servers. Ours took forever to return to our table and nothing on the menu was explained. My wife ordered the farmers pasta and I ordered the strip loin and I have to say it was probably one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had. Definitely a worthy stop."}
{"text":"The view is amazing! 5 star scenery! With that said, the restaurant menu was horrible. We arrived slightly after 6 and they started serving \"dinner\". We watched the last five bacon cheese burgers come out of the kitchen for happy hour customers. Our waiter took 45 minutes to even ask if we wanted to order food and deliver our first drink. The dinner menu was solely composed of 1 pork option, fish and scallops, and vegetables. One item labeled cauliflower steak, is actually an undercooked slice of cauliflower grilled like a steak. Buyer beware, there is no red meat or chicken anywhere on the menu. The menu is improperly labeled and everything on it is pretentious and over priced. The manager told us he would make us a \"special steak\" next time. Ha, there won't be a next time and we have seen the movie Waiting."}
{"text":"Let's start with a Very Happy Healthy New year..!!  What an amazing Transformation ...So Beautiful I love it .. It is quite intoxicating ...Very Happy and Blessed...xo"}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service, bad drinks. 

Salt seems to be their favorite ingredient. 

Ordered an old fashion and got a whiskey and soda with an orange slice. 

When I complained manager did nothin to fix. 

Many better choices. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Views are specular.  However the food and service depend on the night.  There have been times that it has taken forever to get seated, even though tables are open (this is with a reservation)  Also, there is a new chef, not impressed thus far. Overpriced menu.  Not a great wine selection....."}
{"text":"Recently I had the privilege of dining at Flourish to celebrate my birthday.  Flourish, and the newly renovated resort, was a delicious gift!  Not only was dinner fabulous, with the new decor being visually uplifting, refreshing, and comfortable, and then the view from the dining room . . .  one can only say, \"Wow!\"  
Beginning with the staff, they were attentive, understated (as they should be), and knowledgeable.  I was with two companions, and we chose different offerings for each course.  The presentations were amazing, portions enough for each of us, (not small; not too much), and each mouthful enticed me to try, and then want, another!  
As a sampling of our fare, we started with Crispy Brussel Sprouts, and Soy Agave Glazed Quail, then Artisan Greens and Escarole salads, with our entrees of Smoked Muscoy Duck Breast, Seared Diver Scallops, and Sunflower Seed Risotto.  Every plate was creative, healthy, perfectly prepared.  
My hat off to the chef and staff of Flourish.  Coming from a fine dining background, from start to end, our dining experience was impeccable!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a very pleasant setting with views of Fountain Hills.  Staff was helpful and pleasant. The menu selection was good and the food delicious."}
{"text":"I love a good fruit-yogurt-granola breakfast and Flourish amazed me with their healthy-yet-delicious take on this! Really yummy! Lunch - Ahi tacos - and dinner - salmon - were also delicious! Great views overlooking Fountain Hills in a very chic room!"}
{"text":"The remodeling is gorgeous and the views are to die for. The food is still good but the service is HORRIBLE! Was there three times in the past month and it took FOREVER to get served --- 35 minutes to get our coffee (after asking for it five times) and an hour and 20 minutes to get our meals. Two of the last three times I was hosting a group of friends and was EMBARRASSED by the poor service. We won't be going back there any time soon. It's such a shame, because when they opened less than six months ago, the service was fabulous. It has experienced a lot of turnover, is short staffed, and has really gone down hill fast."}
{"text":"this place usually does better. we took a good friend from out of town here for a special lunch. we got there at one pm only to find they were serving breakfast only. the menu was limited with standard sides which were extra. my wife and i had the designated spinach omelet. both were way overcooked. our guest had a standard eggs over basic breakfast....meh. if you want to be upscale this was a big fail.  nice view but almost a hundred bucks for 3 drinks and 3 run of the mill breakfast plates.  too bad"}
{"text":"We dined at Flourish twice in a week and I can say the service is consistent (consistently bad). The first time for dinner the waiter was stressed and overworked, handling too many tables. The next time we went for happy hour. The service started out well. But when we were finished (and our waiter knew we were finished), we couldn't find him. And we had to ask two other people for our bill. Finally our waiter brought over our bill as we were waiting at the front entrance to leave. Management needs to add staff or they won't be open very long before even thinking of expanding. The food is good but nothing compensates for poor service."}
{"text":"My compliments to the staff for an outstanding dining experience on Friday evening.
We sat on the terrace and Chad was our server. He was wonderful!
The Brussel sprouts appetizer was to die for so we had to order a second!
My guests from Chicago thoroughly enjoyed the evening and the menu. We ordered the duck, salmon and scallops. Everything was excellent, fresh and beautifully presented.
I will recommend to all my out of town guests. The views are second to none in AZ!
Thank you for a lovely evening of fine dining."}
{"text":"Tina is awesome!! She walked me through the menu and helped me decide what I wanted to order. The 2 things I was questioning she gave her honest opinion about, and I loved the Brussel Sprouts and the charcuterie board that I ended up getting, both delish. Ask for Tina!!"}
{"text":"We drove 45 min from Tempe to do dinner with my folks who were in town. This was based on it being top rated on OpenTable. This has now made me lose all faith in OpenTable's rating system and pricing guideline. The view was nice if you had a good table for it. We requested a patio table and had a partial view which was mostly blocked by trees. I think the photos online are deceiving. They had two women singing that sounded like a church choir practicing their Sunday Hymns. It was so awful we couldn't even hear ourselves think. The server had a very cold personality. The food was extremely overpriced and a very limited menu. (there's not a salad under $16 or entree under $35). The Ceasar salad had no flavor. The entrees took forever to be served. This was really annoying as we were told the patio was heated. Come to find out there were only 2 heaters for the entire patio. It was so dark on the patio, we couldnt even see the food on our plates. The short rib was blah. Too salty. Overall we had a horrible experience in my opinion. I should have been leary that open table had every time slot available on a Friday night. This is the kind of place your grandparents take you for a fancy dinner when you visit them. Overall it's in the middle of nowhere, no atmosphere whatsoever, crappy service, overpriced flavorless food and a partially decent view if you get one of the 10 tables that can see it. I honestly am only giving them 2 stars as I happened to find this cookie tray in the hallway to the bathroom that had freshly baked cookies to take. I ended up taking four to go and one more for the way out. Its a consolation for the dirty trick OpenTable played on me..."}
{"text":"The ambiance and view are terrific. The service os a bit slow.... the food was good but needed more flavor. My drink was really good (ginger mojito.
Overall, pretty spot with a view and food is decent."}
{"text":"First off, the service here is great. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, their hard work and enthusiasm are the only good things I can say about this overpriced, uninspired, severely mediocre restaurant and resort. The menu is limited. The food, bland at best. (The panini I ordered was utterly tasteless. I've had better sandwiches at Subway.) Their \"signature\" drinks look interesting on paper but the bartender who thought these flavorless, watered down \"cockfails\" up needs to go back to mixology school right away. 

If your in the beautiful Fountain Hills area, eat, drink and stay anywhere but here. Flourish (and Copper Wynd) feel like a dingy, tired old resort that might have shined in the 70's but whose better days have long since passed. (Not unlike the clientele that still frequents this place.)"}
{"text":"Had a coupon from Travelzoo for this restaurant and first impression was great. Beautiful view and we were given a nice table. From there, all downhill. Waited 20 minutes for drink order then another 20 before drinks showed up. My wife ordered a beet salad with chicken, and I ordered the prime rib French Dip. Thirty minutes later still waiting on food and drink refills. Our food finally showed but missing the chicken on the salad. My sandwich showed without any au jus, and a burnt roll. Food tasted fine but not worth the wait  and definitely not at full price."}
{"text":"Friends of ours who live near Fountain Hills suggested this new spot for dinner, and I have to say I was very impressed. The best and most interesting selection of plates I've seen in a long time, and nothing too \"out there\" -- everything offered sounded great and fresh. I had the kale caesar which was amazing, and the scallops for my entree. Husband had the ravioli which he said was not as good. Great wine selection and good drinks. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful view and great food.  We love to bring our out of town friends to this restaurant.  Very pricey and a few of the menu items are not worth the price tag.  For example, $21 for 3 bruschettas.  Also, it would be nice if they had a decent happy hour.  The hours are very narrow and the menu is small.  It would be nice to see more drinks, food and longer hours.  It would certainly attract more customers."}
{"text":"Attended a seminar in the back room conducted by a reputable financial advisor.  While I was to eat in the back room,  I noticed the SUPER AMAZING VIEWS while I walked through the restaurant.   So FLOURISH probably cannot be topped in terms of views.  But it goes downhill from there.  The service was lacking and the young lady with long dark hair had an attitude that was a cross between snotty, arrogant and rude.  I don't know who hired her but she is not material for interacting with humans. Let's call her Ms. Nasty.  The older female server was more pleasant and attempted to be accomodating.  Thank you for changing the salad to one without dressing.  
The company generously provided steak dinners for us except that the restaurant made them all well done. One diner at our table called the steak \"interesting.\"  When one of us asked to get his steak rare, Ms. Nasty said that was not possible.  So one of us chose not to eat an overdone piece of meat and Ms. Nasty gleefully took it back to the kitchen.  The dessert was a piece of overbaked chocolate cupcake with burnt edges, whipped cream and a sprig of mint.  The sprig of mint was delicious.   The other server graciously served all of us coffee with a smile and without an attitude.  
It is such a shame that this amazing location and view is overshadowed by badly prepared food and  super poor service."}
{"text":"We purchased the New Year's Eve package with the Copperwynd resort which included dinner and free flowing champagne as well as brunch for two New Year's Day at flourish. Dinner was fine. We like to have a really nice meal on New Year's Eve to celebrate our lives together. The service was a 4 out of 5. The food was ok and dessert (chocolate bread pudding) was less than ok and served cold. The live music was great and we danced until just before midnight when we went to our room. The view was incredible, so I'll add that to my review of the resort itself. Brunch was awful. It wasn't $100 a person, only $38, so I guess I can't compare it to other up scale brunches, but even for that price I expect a decent meal. The selection was slim. They had warming trays out with ham, bacon and potatoes. There was what they called a yogurt bar (with no yogurt in sight) which consisted of wilted salad since it was right by the window and there was not an attempt to keep it chilled, whole pears, pineapple, strawberries and blueberries. There was also a granola and dried fruit tray, but again, no yogurt, chocolate pastries and the most surprising of all was the left over bread pudding from the previous night was served for brunch!! The ham was cold, bacon was swimming in its own grease, the strawberries were oddly squishy, like they were previously frozen and the last bite I took was of a rotten potato. I lost my appetite after that. They did have an omelette bar. The omelettes ended up being the only thing I could really eat. They also had a Bloody Mary bar, we had one trip a piece included in our meal. The bloody was also quite tasty. Overall, I wish the ingredients were fresh, but they weren't. We won't dine here again. It definitely was not worth the price we paid."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley! 1 of a kind view, excellent service and wonderful food. The mixed drinks were great too. Love everything including the 3 fireplaces and the bathrooms :)"}
{"text":"A little out of the way, but a beautiful morning made for a great drive.  We went for brunch and weren't disappointed, the views from the patio are impressive!  My husband and I decided to brunch like Millenials and ordered the avocado toast and had a few mimosas-really yummy.  An attentive, kind server made for a perfect time- we'll be back for a sunset dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, decor & service! Beautiful views & great wine too!"}
{"text":"Special dinner to celebrate our daughters engagement. Friendly staff, wonderful waiter. The food was very good."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to dine at Flourish on two separate occasions. Once for lunch with my mom, and once by myself for appetizers at the bar. Both times, the first thing I noticed was how absolutely stunning the restaurant is, not only in decor but of course the breathtaking view of Fountain Hills. 
For lunch my mom and I both had the roasted turkey sandwich- she had sweet potato fries and I had the shoestring fries. The sandwiches were delicious and our server was very attentive. 
On my solo visit, I was greeted warmly by the General Manager, Charlie. He was super friendly and reviewed the menu with me. I ended up having the Artisan Greens, which was amazing! The candied pecans, grapes and goat cheese paired with the vinaigrette was very refreshing. 
I'm excited to have an upscale but comfortable restaurant here in Fountain Hills. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Me? I'm a meat and potatoes guy.  When my wife advised we were going to Flourish, I read the menu and said, \"There's not much here for me...\"

Bottom line:  The views, the service, the food, the decor was fabulous.
I had a Tandoori steak with a horseradish sauce that was out of this world.

We can't wait to return to this great new spot.  It's charming...cozy...even romantic.

PS Don't tell anyone as it will become impossible to book a table. 
I give it 6 stars.

So long to my old haunts.

{"text":"Oh Em Gee!!! Talk about an over-the-top-romantic-breath-taking-view-amazing Valentine's Day dinner. Wow! I gotta say, I absolutely LOVE the remodel of Copperwynd Resort -- bravo, fantastic work! The ambiance and decor and everything just sweeps you off your feet the moment you walk in -- so elegant and well put together. And then that view of the mountains, just as the sun is setting and peaking over the top of the mountains, revealing those fire-y orangish/red/pink/purple colors; absolutely breath-taking. Let's take a moment to appreciate Arizona sunsets, people! 

Ok so I was already completely enamored with Flourish the moment I stepped foot inside; everything was absolutely perfect -- including the company I was with. We, of course, had a reservation, seeing how it was the weekend of Valentine's Day... and we all know you gotta snag up the good places quick! We got seated right away, and although we weren't outside on the patio right next to the railing, we were at the first tables just inside the restaurant, still with an amazing view of the brilliant sunset. 

We walked to our table, and quickly went outside before even getting greeted by our server to snap some photos of the sunset (ah, so romantic!) We took a selfie, but then the sweetest server, Robert, came to us and asked if we wanted him to take the photo -- of course, yes! He then explained that he would be the one taking care of us and didn't know where we had disappeared to until the hostess pointed us out. Lol. 

We followed Robert back to our table, where he asked if we wanted any cocktails. ***My favorite thing to do is ask servers what THEY personally recommend... 'cause let's face it, when you work in a restaurant, you get to try everything first hand*** Robert informed us that there was a \"special\" cocktail on the menu -- some coconut martini something (don't remember the name... for good cause, hahaha!) I took his advice and ordered one... and so did my date. Woah those were dangerous!!! They were so perfectly smooth and just enough sweet not to overpower the other flavors... You can't stop at just one. 

Then they brought us bread... which the bread itself was okay on its own, I mean, it was bread... but then the butter they had! Holy moly! It was roasted onion whipped butter something (of course I don't remember the exactness of it), but I almost licked the butter plate clean. Don't judge me! You would understand if you would've had it too. 

For the appetizer we ordered the grilled asparagus that came with crab and this delightfully delicious cojita cheese croutons that my date and I kind of fought over -- yes, they were THAT good! I highly recommend the grilled asparagus. 

For the entree, since I was already full from everything I stuffed my face with, I ended up ordering just a salad -- the kale Caesar. It was good, nothing spectacular... but then again what can you expect from a salad? My date ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi which was fantastic and so rich, like an Italian grandmother just made this amazing home-made cooked meal! So yum! 

Just as we finished our dinner, Robert asked if we wanted dessert... and as much as I didn't want dessert because I didn't have anymore room in my stomach; I couldn't say no -- I tried to, but the word just wouldn't come out of my mouth... So I opted for the next best thing -- whatever Robert recommended. Again, I don't remember exactly what it was... but I do remember that he said it was some olive oil cake with berries and a scoop of ice cream on top (it was late into the evenings and a few cocktails in at this point...), but it was mouth-wateringly delicious! My date and I nearly ate the whole thing -- even as full as we were. 

Overall experience was the BEST!!! From the moment we walked in, to the moment we left, everything was perfect! The service, food, atmosphere, drinks, dessert, view... it was absolutely a perfect evening, and I couldn't have asked for more."}

{"text":"We've  been members since this places' inception. This is our last year of membership. Cancelled  earlier but apparently  We were obligated  till end of year.  The total operations  have increasingly  gotten worse over the last 10+ years.  This is not reflective on gym  facilities, which I don't  use.  Service at members event tonite was a joke. Had it not been for Anthony (bartender ) we'd  have had NO service.  Place is fantastic, vu incredible,  Food good.  But too much lacking in service!  Overall management is suckling air. Shame."}
{"text":"Food was good and the views were unbelievable, but overall disappointed by the service. Our waitress was unfriendly and not helpful wth the menu. Omelettes from the omelette bar were good - but at 20 bucks they should look to offer toast or some other accompaniment to the meal. Had to ask a few members of the waitstaff several different times for toast/butter/jam/etc. We were encouraged by members of the waitstaff to give feedback to the manager which we did, but he did not appear to be receptive. Hope they can get it together."}
{"text":"Loved the place! The view is beautiful! Food is very good and drinks too! Order a dirty martini"}
{"text":"I have been here before and loved it, however on New years eve it was just plain mediocre.....and in some ways a rip off. Menu had only a few items and a price fixed. BUT NO PRICE ON THE MENU or told to us. WTF is that? Soup came cold with no spoon. We had to ask for a spoon! Salad was just\" \"OK\" . Halibut could have been a sunfish. No flavor and a tiny portion. Desert was ordered at the beginning. Gelato pistachio...served chocolate. Geez.....tip was added to the check at 20% so I had to cross that out. OH BTW they charged for ice in my cocktail?? I am NEVER going back"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a one star for location.  I can be very precise to what was bad. But let me just say; just go there for view and location and have drinks. The food and service is at best 0.  This will be our last time here for dining.  I would recommend the manager  to be at least be equal to a medíocre restaurants in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"This place started out with such high-hopes. The remodel was awesome. Perfectly in tune with the times and the gorgeous view that the restaurant has. The food and the cocktails were  well conceived and executed and the service was acceptable (but needed to improve). Unfortunately, the last couple of times, the place has has the down instead of up. The menu is brand new because they have a whole new kitchen (still good but not what it should be), the cocktail menu has disappeared (along with fresh-squeezed juices), and the service is awful. It is such a shame because this place should be one of the top restaurants in the valley (simply because of the view) but no one can seem to figure out what it is supposed to be and who it really wants to serve. I will still hold out hope but I am not optimistic."}
{"text":"Strictly based on service- arguably the worst service I have had. No host, finally gave order at hostess station to server who never brought water nor food. Ordered ceviche/cold likely in  a bowl in kitchen fridge just waiting to be scooped out. Took over 30 minutes & server never once came out. Had to ask for meal, water & check. We have frequented this establishment many times but will not be returning."}
{"text":"My wife took me to Flourish for Fathers Day dinner.  I have to say the food and service were EXCELLENT!  The Fathers Day specials and wine pairings were spot on.  My compliments to Chef Thomas and his staff for a wonderful dining experience.  Can't wait for the new menu to begin later this week.  Bravo Flourish!!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Flourish.  The hospitality and service was outstanding and the view is  absolutely incredible.  It is worth the drive and well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Terrific restaurant in a terrific location. Great view and exceptional service.  The Osso Buco was tender and delicious, but save room for the table-side Smores."}
{"text":"Resort prices, service is adequate but if they get busy you will have to ask for server to get anything. Food is good but pricy. Beautiful local and if they would offer more specials to entice people to give it a try I think it would be more enjoyable. At the level of this resort the service should be impeccable, falls short of this expectation."}
{"text":"Very disappointing night at a restaurant that has recently been remodeled and has one of the best views in the East Valley 
Last night they advertised St Patrick's Happy hour 2-9.  I realize this is not an Irish pub but when we got there there was not one connection to the holiday music ,decorations, what beers were available or what was offered on the Happy Hour menu . I did not see one person order from the Happy hour menus ...something is wrong 
The waitress was surly and could not have cared less about her patrons.  We have had her in the past and it was the same behavior 
Probably the only bar in the country where the NCAA tourney was being played and the games were not on 
Some guy asked for the bartender to change the channels 15 min later he gave the controller to the guy for him to find it 
People and Staffing make a restaurant and a bar this place struggles with its people choice 
Also do not advertise you will be doing a themed event and do nothing 
Too many other places in the Valley to try this place again"}
{"text":"Charlie and his team are amazing. Prompt, attentive, and friendly. Lunch and the view are off the chain. Stop in after a hike and enjoy a cold local draft. The decor and ambiance is first class yet unpretentious, after all this is wonderful Fountain Hills, not Scottsdale. 
Dinner is extravagantly sophisticated, everything you'd expect, five stars, fine dining. The bar is huge, comfy and inviting. 
Give this Fountain Hills gem a chance. You won't be disappointed.
Great cocktail menu with fresh, real fruit juices for the ladies. 
Gentleman, plenty of scotch to choose from, ice ball to boot. 
Lunch: burger top notch, BLT far from ordinary. Choose either the sweat potato chips or the shoestring fries, you won't be disappointed.
Dinner: I've had the pork loin, scallops, salmon and one day hope to tackle the 40oz porterhouse. The pork loin is prepared perfectly to order, pick your temp. I picked medium and it was wonderful. The scallops were decadent, rich like butter. Get the brussel sprouts and potatoes. 
Pro tip: Get there just before sunset to enjoy the mountain view."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in northeast Scottsdale. Views are spectacular, decor is ultra chic, servers are awesome. And new chef and menu are fantastic! This is our new Friday after work go to spot."}
{"text":"We were staying at copperwynd and stopped in for an early breakfast (opens at 7) before setting out on out days adventures. At that time on a Saturday morning we were one of only two tables active at that time of day.

We were seating by the window and enjoyed the bright morning sunshine streaming in. The menu is pretty limited but we had no problem selecting; sour dough French toast with berries and Vermont maple syrup for me and frittata with tomatoes and goat cheese for my wife.

The food arrived quickly and we enjoyed a quiet reflective meal. The only area for improvement is the orange juice-from concentrate- which is really odd since just below the restaurant in the hotel is a fresh juice and smoothly bar.  Seems to me they could get it there.

Prices were very reasonable, entrees were around $11 each-a pretty good deal.

RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"Dinner: great server and service. this place has good ambience. Food : not exceptional but still pretty good. Location of this restaurant is probably the most selling point as it has great views and patio. 
Breakfast: very slow service, nice attentive server though. Food was so-so. Pancakes were very salty. Again, location is really the best aspect."}
{"text":"The view is spectacular. The service attentive. The room is beyond compare. All this a very good start to an amazing brunch on Sunday. The Turkey Bacon Swiss melt with avocado on toasted bread was amazing. As a Boston couple we aren't used to the option of broccolini grilled as a side. Please let me tell you order that it's delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible wait staff experience at this establishment. Brought a 92 year old in for her birthday. Service lacked attentiveness. Wrong meals delivered. Drink requests blown off. Not even a free desert for the 92 year old. Stay away!! Poor value for the money"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated my birthday here last night and couldn't have been more pleased. Our server was very personable and helpful, even double checking on the bottle of wine we ordered since she believed it was available at a  discounted price.  I had the filet and it was awesome. It was accompanied by some great augratin Potatoes and grilled asparagus.  My husband loves pork so he ordered the pork chop which was really two chops, uncut. Very moist. As it was my birthday I was entitled to a free dessert however I was too full to eat anything more. So our server brought us one of her favorite desserts boxed for us to take home. Nice touch!  We had a window table and the views were awesome. I love seeing the sunset reflected on Four Peaks!"}
{"text":"There aren't enough Yelp reviews to describe how much I love Flourish. This restaurant is elegant and romantic while maintaining an open and welcoming vibe. I've been here on dates with my fiancé and In more casual group settings. Every time I've been it's been lovely. 

Each item on the menu is delish, but you have to try the brussel sprouts appetizer! Don't skip dessert either - I mean if you're going to go here, treat yo self baby. 

Try to sit on the patio if it's nice. Beautiful view of Fountain Hills and the mountains. Perfect setting for a romantic date. Get dressed up and take your boo thang here ASAP. It'll score you major brownie points!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks and service (Chaz) and don't forget the VIEW!  One of the best meals I've had, great selection including vegetarian and gluten free options. I highly recommend the Brussels sprouts and the flourish salad!  I had the cauliflower steak and it was good, but could have been so much better. It could have been roasted better especially before the cheese was added (cheese didn't really add any flavor:/  It also could've used a more rounded meal-feel like served over the mushroom risotto or with a lentil/quinoa sweet potato hash?  That would be my only complaint-the price of a single piece of cauliflower was not equivalent to \"steak\"- everything else was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The view of 4 peaks over the city is absolutely stunning!  The food is simply amazing, delicious and responsibly healthy!  I will return over and over again!  Try the brussel sprouts, they are unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Beautiful views, excellent service and delicious food.  Dinner menu offers a good selection, will be back."}
{"text":"We recently celebrated a special occasion at Flourish, hoping that it would be just as good as Alchemy.  It was better.  Exceptional cocktails, tasty dinners (try the pork tenderloin and pasta) and appetizers (crispy brussel sprouts), wonderful service (thank you, Francisco!).  Additionally, the renovations are fabulous--contemporary, hip and spacious. I am already in serious love with this place.  Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"The view, decor and ambiance are a 5. The noise level is a 3. Unfortunately the food, while well priced, is horrible. The cheese beer soup should have been thick with some cheddar base but it was thin, salty and strongly flavored. The half sandwich was tiny. Our friend's salads were boring. Wine was ok but overpriced. I'd go back for the setting but hope they get a new chef."}
{"text":"Brought grandma here for happy hour appetizers and drinks.  The service was fast and friendly.  The drinks were good.  And the menu was just big enough.  We loved the Brussel sprouts.  The hummus was good.  And the Ahi tacos were okay.  It's our second or third time there, and we'll be happy to go back.
Also - they had Christmas carolers singing throughout (see pic).

{"text":"They have done a fabulous job on the renovations.  CopperWynd has always had spectacular views but the updated lounge and dining room and patio are just out of this world!  We had a dinner party of 7 and the meals were all very good, Salmon, Scallops, Shrimp, Chicken and the drinks were great.  We had a deconstructed Caprese salad  and it was just terrific.  I would venture this hidden gem is going to be the next hot spot.  Get there, and do it soon!
PS They really need a mixed drink menu that you can hold in your hand and review and we weren't impressed with our waitress but the service was really good."}
{"text":"Awesome spot off the beaten path. We just came here to grab some breakfast. I recommend the Saguaro Skillet. Great food, great views, and great service."}
{"text":"The only reason I didnt give this 5 stars was because the menu is somewhat limited. What you get is amazing, though. The views can't be topped. Visit - see the Fountain - try the beet salad."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places (unfortunately no breakfast served during this summer). Love, love the views and my favorite dish is their chicken and sweet potato hash. We like to meet our Fountain Hills real estate clients here for coffee and breakfast for their first meeting with our Scottsdale Home-store team! Great service, lovely ambiance and delicious food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Amazing view over fountain hills, always fresh, delicious food, and even better service! 

Highly recommend to visitors of Arizona or even locals looking for somewhere new to dine."}
{"text":"Ugh. I so wanted to love this place -- great views, great reviews, and an excellent menu online. Which is why we chose to have our anniversary dinner there. Who knew that when you try to order at 7:30 pm on a Saturday night, that the chef would be out of TWO of the seven entrees on the menu (gnocchi and sea bass) which happened to be my only two choices.  I seriously almost cried. I asked if they could do something similar to those dishes but with different pasta/protein, and ended up with an oddly sweet concoction with what would otherwise have been good homemade noodles... So disappointing!! Our server was apologetic but no one - no manager, no chef - came out to say anything about the unfortunate situation even though they knew it was our special dinner. I was so disgusted with the experience that I declined the free dessert thy offered. I just wanted to be out of fountain hills...

The one thing I ate - The pork belly appetizer - was tasty but was an odd combination of avocado hummus and very smokey. The service was okay but certainly not what I would call fine dining -- I had to ask him about a dish that wasn't on the menu but was apparently a special... Overall a very disappointing experience. 

I will not be driving almost an hour back out here any time soon."}
{"text":"We have been here twice for dinner.  The first dinner was amazing.  The fried sweet potatoes just flew off of the plate.  The duck was perfectly cooked and moist.  Scallops also plump and sweet.  The gem lettuce salad had wonderful soft fresh lettuce with a great blend of flavors, which included raisins, apples and a lovely light dressing.  So five star meal right?

Not so much last Saturday.  The place was LOUD.  It is open, and pretty, very contemporary but nothing to muffle loud people and when the place is packed you can go deaf.  This will improve when the glass walls can be open and there will be outdoor seating, so that is good.

They were quite late seating us.  I was annoyed and they bought us a drink, but still they need to get a handle on this.  Dine early or late is my advice....

But what happened to the food????? The fried sweet potatoes were oily and over cooked.  On par with, maybe Bennigans.....The duck was dry, and the Gem salad was a mess!   A very hard petrified piece of romaine with no raisins, maybe one slice of apple and scant dressing.  Really a downer!!!!  Only the scallops maintained their quality.

So this meal was a 3, and if I had not experienced the prior 5 star meal, I'd be gone, but will give them one more try.

So PLEASE WORK ON CONSISTENCY FOLKS.  The reason we dine at places like Eddie V's is you get the same quality of food every time you go, and almost never have to wait for your table!!!!"}
{"text":"They only good thing about my families dinner last night was the service. They were attentive and willing to please. However, the service being good doesn't cover how dreadful the food was. All the dishes were over salted. Halibut that was supposed to have a Parmesan crust was just salt crust. The fillets were cooked to be salty shoe leather and the short ribs were chewy and salty. It's so unfortunate for a resort that is thought so high of cooks such terrible food. The poke bowl was so spicy it was pallet ruining with its smothering of intense spice making the best part of the dish the wonton crisps. The Cajun Alfredo had chewy noodles that were more then just al dente. Not to forget mentioning how do you mess up chicken tenders and butter noodles for children....... chunky buttter soup settled at the bottom on the noodles  and tough to chew COLD chicken. For the price my grandparents paid to treat us to dinner this meal was worth it. 

And if your going to stick \"large groups with kids\" on a patio then start a fire burning nose inflaming wood below where they are sitting."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a blind date.  They let us choose our own table right on the patio by the water fountain.  The waitress Bailey was amazing.  I had the Flourish salad and the Brussel sprouts.  Everything tasted scrumptious.  My date had the chicken sandwich with fries,  The sandwich was great but the shoestring fries were definitely too thin.  For dessert, we had the banana cream brulee which of course was great with blueberries and strawberry cream on the side.  Bailey kept coming back to refill our glasses so they were never empty.  Great views, Great service, and Great food - Priceless.   We will be coming back"}
{"text":"Jenny was fabulous, the view is amazing! Their menu (both food and cocktails) rocks! Its decorated beautifully, has a great bar and share table for larger parties. I loved the Roasted Chicken ;)"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place for dinner, and the food was well-executed in both presentation and taste, however service was off. Having been in the industry, I would expect better in here. Can't go higher than 3 stars, but wouldn't go below by any means. If you plan to order wine, please do see what I have included about the feature wine.

Let's start with the food:

CRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUTS were so great. I'd order them again. We finished the bowl.

ROASTED PORK BELLY you don't need the toast points that come with this dish. The pork belly was great, with the brie, pistachio and microgreens. Well done.

GRILLED GEM LETTUCE this dish was beautifully plated. I couldn't start eating it right away, I just wanted to keep looking at it. Amazing presentation. Let me just say it again. Just beautiful! 

OK, so for the service. We stopped after small plates for a few reasons:

Our server was very likeable. However, she told us about the feature wine, THE ARSONIST (which may have different spelling). DO NOT ORDER. It was nice and soft..here's the thing:

When she poured the first glass for my husband (after giving him the first sample), as she came up from the pour it splattered across the table. Not like a little dribble, like half a glass at least. It was incredible, and shocking. She apologized, and explained they took it off the menu for by the glass because of the large lip on the bottle, and that it happens often. I appreciate the honesty, but I am now irritated that Flourish is offering it as the feature wine to get it off the shelf due to the poor bottle design. She offered to move our table because of the huge mess, or change the tablecloth. I was being nice by declining, however I would think the bottle would be discounted after it had been just as much on the table as it was in the glass. She put a napkin over the large stain, and went forward with service.

Between our server and the runners, nothing that was brought to our table was presented. Nothing was described. What kind of butter was served with the bread? Just crucial steps of service. No app plates with our apps, just our small bread dish. 

Our server was vegetarian and really only talked about veg. items on the menu. I definitely respect that as I was vegetarian for a while, but in a restaurant, you have to be able to at least say the staff enjoys a specific dish be it the branzini or espresso-rubbed steak or anything that wasn't pumpkin or asparagus, to satisfy the general public as clientele. Again she was charming and likeable, but service was a bit of a miss between everyone who touched the table. 

Overall a little disappointing, but I really am glad we tried it. The food was well worth it. I wouldn't write it off just yet, though a little refresher here in service seems necessary."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Flourish.  Amazing meal and the staff was incredible.  We sat near the window and we could not believe the views.  We could see Four Peaks and the fountain.  A magical night!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast while staying at CopperWynd resort.  My wife and I shared the pear and banana pancakes, along with the Big Bird breakfast sandwich. Both were amazing, and the sweet potato hash was addictive! Bailey was our server and was attentive and helpful, and the view cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place with Help from YELP and loooooved it. Coffee was outstanding and worth the price of coffee these days.  All three entrees were exceptional.... breakfast potatoes were beyond delicious !!!! Decor is modern and very tastefully done. Recommended for everyone except small children."}
{"text":"Excellent ambience; excellent service; great wine list; good food...must ask for John Dominick (French), alone, he's worth it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant needs help! We had breakfast there this morning which came with our stay the breakfast buffet is small and leaves a lot to be desired. If you're looking for an airport type traveler Hotel breakfast, you get it with this Buffet! In addition on a Saturday morning when they are very crowded they had one server who told us that she was very busy and didn't have time yet to get more plates. it was just us and one other couple at that time. it's free so I am not going to say too much about the food. However, we never got refills on our coffee or our Waters!

Dinner was an experience, we had very nice wine and a very nice cheese plate. I ordered the scallops which were huge and beautiful but tasted like they used the entire salt shaker on them. I sent them back and our waitress told us the other people had done the same. When they came back out they were cold and raw in the middle and my side that came with it of gnocchi was now burnt to a crisp. I cut into each one and only one was cooked enough to eat. I again sent them back, and they brought me back my plate of cut into scallops that they just threw back in the pan and cooked.Our waitress was so friendly but at this point they really should have had a manager come out and should have really comped my meal. They did give us a piece of cake and coffee. My husband ordered steak which was overcooked but tasted really good. We probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Of course the beautiful view, that everyone recommended was worth it. It was semi-expensive ($80+ for two people, only one drink ordered). The service was exquisite. We had a man helping us who was really nice and recommended a drink for me which turned out great! The food was delicious, and the pasta was enough for leftovers, but wasn't a huge amount to begin with. I made a reservation ahead of time and they let us sit by the windows. Great experience, highly recommend if you want a fancy/expensive restaurant to go to here in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"it is my third time and last time
the decor is beautiful but the menus are not up to a great restaurant
the service is ok,
went to brunch today and it is the worst menu i have ever had ,
difficult to make a choice,ended up choosing a turkey melt on sourdough...and when it came was just regular toasts of white bread...with cold cuts of turkey???not appetizing at all
mimosa was orange juice with a touch of sparking..really.
the 2 stars i give is for the decor only.
the previous times was i time happy hour, and before that dinner..
3 times have done it for me."}
{"text":"This review is for the pool-side grill with the same menu as the upstairs restaurant. Wow. Brandon was hustling beyond measure this sunny day in December - loads of people relaxing by the pool and a large party eating lunch just before us. But wow. Great customer service, and a delicious lunch. My spinach, goat cheese salad with the grilled salmon could not have been more perfect. Delicate and well-seasoned, flavorful and huge. My partner had the pasta - so creamy and a bit spicy, but perfect with shrimp. Our sweet potato fries were the best - lovely sweet potato flavor and crisped to perfection. Can't wait to try this place again!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for \"happy hour\" on a Monday afternoon and stayed for dinner. Since this is a resort affiliated restaurant I expected to pay resort prices. Yes, this place is expensive. Because of the heat, there were no more than 6 customers between 3:30 and 6:00pm. We had the happy hour hummus and it was exactly as expected except it was rather large and easily enough for two. Dinner service begins at 5 and we were seated promptly because we were the only guests in the restaurant having dinner. We requested a window seat and again not a problem. Getting to the good stuff, the scallops were in a lobster sauce and huge. The meal came with gnocchi, spectacular. The pork chop was a double chop, cooked medium and enough for two people. Wine list selection is minimal but sufficient. The Rhombauer Chardonnay was reasonable at $16.50 a glass. 
The wait staff were very attentive and responsive to requests. The wait staff really carried the day for this dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely gorgeous. The views alone are worth 3 stars, as is the tastefully decorated restaurant. Great atmosphere. My only complaint is the food -- it just want great for the price. It wasn't bad, but it didn't meet the standard that the location and cost sets up. I was a party of 6 and got to try what others got. The menu could use more flavorful \"wow\" items like the goat cheese fondue."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner to celebrate my marriage licence on Friday, the 26th. Beautiful view, fantastic atmosphere and gorgeous restrooms. Unfortunately, my fiance found some saran wrap in the onion butter provided with the complimentary bread. She found it after chewing on it for a minute, gross. The manager apologized and said like \"I want you to know I have told the chefs about their mistake.\" Also giving more bread and butter. Which seemed unsatisfactory in the moment, but after the meal our nice waiter brought out a great dessert on the house. The dinner itself was subpar. My gnocci was super soft, like jello and tasteless. Her duck was two microscopic strips of meat with a side of raisins and some weird extra salty deep fried organ roll. Yuck. We got a side of sweet potatoes that were yummy - beat part of the meal. The dessert was good too. Blood orange ice cream with marscapone. The coffee was top notch. Overall, an expensive and lackluster meal. But the view is worth 2 stars in itself. Francisco was a great waiter as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful location for a quiet weekend lunch! Service was fantastic and food was great- will definitely be returning for the gorgeous location and breathtaking views!"}
