{"text":"Bummer. I am a lover of bagels. Not the refrigerated grocery store bagels (and don't even get me started on Einstein's)... I'm talking about the freshly made, boiled type with hard outside and soft (but still slightly chewy) inside. Based on the previous reviews, the blurb on their website, and the $5 off $10 yelp deal I figured that I could not go wrong here. 

When I walked in, I saw the display and immediately thought \"oh yeah, this is exactly what I've been craving\". Then I was warmly greeted by two employees and thought, \"so far so good\". The transaction to ring up my dozen plus a plain cream cheese tub was friendly and easy...no complaints there. 

There was only one tub of plain cc left in the fridge and I could see a piece of pink lox inside, so I asked for a fresh one, and my request was promptly and politely fulfilled. It wasn't until I returned home that I noticed  the container was comprised of 50% air (I'm not used to getting full tubs anyways, as they usually go by weight, but this one obviously was on the fly and was not packed with the love or quantity I was desperately hoping for and actually needed to dress 13 bagels with). Additionally, I found the plain CC to be just that..plain...which may sound weird, but most cream cheese has a tiny little bite to it, and this had zero flavor, but still edible.

Despite the burn on the cream cheese, I was still excited to try out the bagels themselves. I started with an \"everything\", which looked wonderful. The outside was done right but as soon as I bit into it, I realized the inside was anything but. It was 9am, so I expected  them to be relatively fresh but I'd almost put money on it that this one was yesterday's that didn't sell. It was however, decent enough that I finished it and then decided to go for round two with an onion bagel...big mistake.

It looked awfully dark on the outside, so I was a bit suspicious and rightfully so. It was burned, very burned, as were the meager amount of onions on it...which were actually torched. Sadly, the inside did not taste any fresher than the first bagel I had. 20 minutes later, I am sitting here with the taste of char in my mouth and very eager to get back to my toothbrush.

Unfortunately, I cannot and will not recommend these to anyone who knows what a great bagel is. They had potential, but that's about it. I can't speak for anything else on the menu and considering they screwed up their namesake, I will never allow myself the opportunity to try another item. I'm giving two stars anyways due to friendliness of the staff for making me feel welcome. 

Thanks anyways."}
{"text":"Is your mouth watering for fresh, soft, fluffy, and airy large bagels with a thick one inch layer of cream cheese? Great to hear! 

Well New York Bagels N Bialys at SkySong is NOT the place to go. Please do not even waste your daily carb count, time or gas to get to the spot. If you ever had an authentic New York bagel; then, you will definitely smell the fake bagels. The presented product is nothing like the engaging website of pictures and verbiage. In fact, the bagel is small, crumbly, and dry. It is only fit for the closest trashcan. I do not believe the bagel was baked today. The ball of nothing is topped with average tasting cream cheese. Did I mention that the cream cheese selection is limited to five (5) flavors? Yes to the point you will not even recognize the jalape√±o cream cheese. Keep driving drown the street--do not stop for the fake and expensive disappointment! We love to support local businesses; however, New York Bagels N Bialys at SkySong will never receive my money again. Have a Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch here with my sister it was our first time as it was tucked away and no signage from Scottsdale Road at all. The menu is extensive with something for everyone! We each ordered a salad with a half sandwich on the side. Then shared a potato pancake. The salads were excellent as well as the potato pancake. The portions here are very large. Was not expecting so much food to arrive on the plates. The place is clean and seems overall well maintained. The staff was friendly but the only drawback was the service was poor. We waited over 15 minutes to place our order. Our server only had two other tables in the restaurant as we had just sneaked in after a peak period which was shortly after brunch. I will be coming back as the food was excellent hoping that the customer service and attention to the customer is focused on more. There is a nice patio outside and they do have a small bar inside."}
{"text":"South Scottsdale has a new restaurant gem to crow about! My wife and I went to NYBB for the first time for lunch recently and came away impressed and grateful to have them in the vicinity.  

Ellen had the deli combo of a 1/2 Philly steak in a hoagie and a cup of matzo ball soup. I had the chicken club sandwich on a bialy hoagie, with a potato pancake on the side. We finished the meal with one of the best and most generous brownies I've ever tasted!

Nick was our server and he was just outstanding. He was attentive, lively, funny, and smart, making our meal that much more of a pleasure. 

Now we plan to go back to NYBB at Skysong for breakfast very soon. The breakfast menu is varied and interesting. Plus, they have an inviting and quiet outdoor patio. 

If you haven't tried this new branch of NYBB yet, get over there and give'em a try! You'll appreciate this advice and the place."}
{"text":"Don't go to this location they don't know how  to cook. Had to ask them to fix my meal twice the 3rd time I  just got up and left burnt potatoes and a small amount of cheese on my omlet a new york meal would pack up the cheese and have good cooked potatoes. When I asked for more cheese they threw unmelted provolone on top. My experience living in nyc and being married to a new yorker theres nothing new york about that plate."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Always fresh and delicious and I always enjoy having lunch out on their patio. The customer service is great and I love so many things on their menu. Definitely my new fav lunch spot on my breaks."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place has moved to the area. Good food and the service was good as well. My daughter had the halal French Toast and we couldn't stop stealing bites."}
{"text":"The new one needs some work. The bagels are good, but how can you be out of Veggie cream cheese at 8 am on a Saturday am. Maybe you forgot to make some. Counter folks need to get over the NY attitude, you're in Scottsdale!  Luckily bagels were good, but small for \" NY Style\"!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple times and have never been disappointed! They do a great job of making you feel like you're in NY getting your daily bagel/bialy. Everyone is super friendly, especially the lady who is at the counter most times - I apologize for not remembering her name but I believe it started with an 'S' She greets everyone that enters with a smile. The food is great and quick and the service is prompt. There's an added bonus of a dog friendly patio! Be sure to check out their fresh pastries they make from scratch every morning!"}
{"text":"Somehow I didn't know about this place but it right around the block and a new local favorite!! We thought it was just a bagel place but it's a sit down with a huge menu of traditional breakfast items. The outdoor seating is great and indoor seating looked roomy as well. The food was delicious and the menu has a huge variety. My boyfriend had ordered coffee with creamer but our waitress forgot the creamer. We had to go inside and get it ourselves but she was so apologetic she gave us free bagel cards for our next visit. It's good service and business like this that creates regulars!! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Brand new breakfast coffeeshop New York vibe!  Dog friendly with big patio, .. breakfast all day that's all I needed to know!  Lunch menu looks legit NY deli style. I've been back for breakfast twice, it's my new go to spot.  It's easy spot to pass and almost kind of hidden of Scottsdale rd. But totally worth it if you need to turn around and drive through skysongs parking lot. This is a great addition to the neighborhood with the limited and or way to busy breakfast options in the area."}
{"text":"The first time my family & I ordered to go, we had a difficult time ordering over the phone but the food was good enough to try again. Today, we ordered food again. The person I talked to on the phone couldn't seem to get my order right, but finally I thought he did. Unfortunately, when I got there to pick up the food, the type of bagel I wanted was out of stock (which why wasn't I notified of that over the phone?) and my order was wrong. Instead of being understanding, I had to wait longer and pay the difference for the mistake. Upon coming home and eating the food, the bagel was not toasted and undercooked. The egg on the egg sandwich was cooked the wrong way and despite that bagel being toasted, it still seemed undercooked. It is hard to say if we will be back, but it isn't looking too good."}
{"text":"Love the space, definitely has that NYC feel. Ordered the breakfast slam #3 with pancakes and the Egg-bagel pile up. The pancakes were a little chewy, but decent. The everything bagel was soft and delicious. I could have done without the home fries though. They were a bit too soft and greasy for my liking. I prefer my home fries to be crispier. Received great service from Trevor and I love that this place is dog friendly."}
{"text":"Place is very nice, coffee is great, we've had breakfast & lunch, everything has been delicious.  Usually Trevor waits on us in the morning, he's awesome, Will is the manager, always comes by to say hi.  Very nice addition to South Scottsdale, we needed a good breakfast place.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I assume the store at SkySong is part of the chain which includes the store at Scottsdale Road and Shea. I am referring to the latter.
I always buy my bagels and bislys here. They are good. But today i was there at lunch and decided to have a pastrami on rye. Big mistake! The rye was good but the pastrami tasteless. It looked as if it was compressed like procesed meat (e.g. bologna). I left more than half the sadwich. The potoato salad was mushy with only a few chewable pieces of potato. I will not eat there again, I will continue to buy the bagels altho my wife always gets a bakers dozen (13) and I received only 12. 
Bad day at NYBB!"}
{"text":"Love that south Scottsdale has a bagel shop yay!! Huge menu nice clean restaurant and staff was very pleasant definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I go here for their salt bagels but their service is why they get this rating. All their serves are all over the place, they don't listen to you while you order and even Togo orders are in correct when the receipt is correct. The service has made me no longer go there for a first choice breakfast spot on the weekend."}
{"text":"Found this place after a Yelp search and decided to come because I haven't had a Bialys since I was a kid and my mom would take me to the Jewish deli.

When you first walk in, at least for me, you're confused. Is this an order at the counter bagel shop or a sit-down restaurant? It's a sit-down place, server and menus and the whole nine. The decor is cool, subway tiles + the New York skyline and simple color palettes for the seating areas. I do like that this place is in SkySong, considering I worked over here for a bit I wish more food options were available back then. Given the menu options and proximity to so many businesses I'm assuming they get pretty busy during lunch and have a good takeout business.

So I ordered an asiago cheese bialys, with a side of bacon and home fries (my grandfather would be rolling over in his grave right now because I do not eat Kosher). I also ordered a cup of coffee, which was really hot (which isn't too awful) but overall good. The bialys was okay, nothing really special about it. Also the bacon was bacon, what's there bad to say about bacon? The home fries were also whatever, not a home run and not awful.

I'll be back, this spot isn't bad it's just not superior to other options. I will have to try them for lunch though, the pastrami looks great."}
{"text":"I went in because I was craving a good bagel with cream cheese. I got an everything bagel with Cream cheese. It wasn't that flavorful, but worst off the bagel was burned on the outside and inside. So the only flavor it really had was burned garlic flavor which isn't really my thing. I'd pass on this place."}
{"text":"From a truly bad cup of coffee to an astounding lack of available bagels, this place has really gone the extra mile in creating a shockingly bad breakfast experience. Toast that's burned on one side and completely untoasted on the other, latkes that were at least 2/3 flour, a caper add on that included 2 capers -- the food was a train wreck.  The server was nice, but incompetent. What a disappointment! And it was damn expensive on top of it all; I should have gone to Circle K and had a donut and coffee there. Don't come here. It sucked."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went a weekday mid morning for breakfast. The service was awesome and they have a big outdoor patio to eat and relax on. I had an omelette with coffee and a bagel with cream cheese to go. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good service. 

Food not good enough to return.

Had 3 eggs, bagel with home fries and sausage.

Eggs cooked nicely.

Sausage: eh.

Home fries: greasy and soft.

Bagel: ok.

Cream cheese: cheap.

\"Fresh\" OJ: not. Returned without problem."}
{"text":"Was looking for a bagel place before my flight back to California.  On route was NYB.  Cool modern building near the ASU campus and a great friendly staff greeted me at the door.  A to go egg/ham/cheese was spot on.  Way different than the chain bagel joints.
Kudos on a fine establishment and I look forward to stopping by again next desert trip."}
{"text":"So yummy! Wonderful bialys and espresso. Beautiful new building and great food. I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place!! Greeted by a nice bubbly staff who explained the menu to us and gave some recommendations! Very clean and modern inside! Full breakfast and lunch menu and a FULL BAR!!! Cold brew coffee, egg-a-bagel pile up and potato pancakes  DELISH"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast spot.  We took our NYC relatives there and they loved the Pastrami, the Matzoh ball soup, the potato pancakes, and the bagels.  It's a 25 minute drive from where we live, but it's worth it.  It doesn't face Scottsdale Rd because it's situated on the backside of the building.  You need to turn on E SkySong Blvd."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. The bagels are amazing and everyone loved the french toast and belgian waffles. The outdoor seating was nice on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, and I will definitely be back. The cinnamon raisin bagel with strawberry cream cheese was fantastic. However, the breakfast burrito tortilla that I got was so thick I couldn't bite or cut into it very well. Probably won't try that again."}
{"text":"So glad this spot opened up so close to home. The staff was so helpful with recommendations and they have a great dog friendly patio! Tried the Denver omelette and the creamed chipped beef on toast, both were delicious! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Extensive, huge menu. Good-sized portions. The food is fresh and nicely prepared! First of many trips here!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after workout and got the bagel n lox w everything & split so double all the goodies.  It was literally the best everything bagel, freshest lox and amazing vegetable cream cheese. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice NY style bagel place. It ain't Jersey but not a bad bagel fix. The veggie spread is full of crisp fresh veggies. We will hit it next weekend for the full egg plate breakfast spread that they have.  Nice place to find in. Service was above par."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service at this location. Shila was my server and she made the whole experience so positive. She had amazing recommendations and made one heck of a mimosa. Definitely would come back regularly."}
{"text":"Really yummy! Great spot and the staff was very accommodating and helpful. Can't wait to go back again and enjoy another delish breakfast."}
{"text":"Came during opening weekend and the service was atrocious. The bagel was just OK. Nothing special. I would like to try other things on the menu, and maybe the service won't be as bad after things settle down."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this place for the first time. We both ordered bagels to go. Ordering took a while. Once receiving our food with quick service both of our bagels were burnt. One was completely black and the other just a little."}
{"text":"This place has the best bagels and bialys the menu is extensive breakfast and lunch and get this $15 all-you-can-drink mimosas and Bloody Mary's all day everyday the quality of food is amazing service is magnificent and they have a dog-friendly patio!!! They have generous portions their sandwiches are unbelievable this will soon be an Old Town local favorite"}
{"text":"Nice place! Good food, great service. Tried the New Yorker pastrami 2x. Perfect, the potato salad was undersalted, a good thing, i prefer to add sodium to my own tolerance.  Branched out a bit today, had breaky, corn beef hash with eggs and bialys, i could not find fault with anything. Also had a Dirty Cow cocktail which was a eye opener with espresso vodka & coffee. Yum. Oh, the Bronx dingdong rocks."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the lack of quality I expect from that price range. As you can see in my image I got a bacon, ham, egg and cheese bagel and there was little to no ham on half of the sandwich. The eggs taste like they come out of a carton and not a shell. The bagel doesn't have the flavor I expect from a NY bagel."}
{"text":"Was excited to have them open around the corner from me.
Tried them today & the bagel was undercooked, the home fries too greasy. 
Hoping it's just because they are still fairly new & they improve with time.

It will be a while before I give them another chance."}
{"text":"Very disappointed this \"scratch\" kitchen uses \"yellow food coloring,\" caramel color and/or canola oil in their bagels/bialys. I can't imagine that real NY delis use this kind of junk in their products. Hopefully they will reconsider."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! The customer service is excellent and the food is delicious! Most of the food is homemade also. Definitely will be coming back, but with my dogs! They now serve our furry friends! :)"}
{"text":"My third time to this place and has progressively gotten worse. I've been going to this place because I like their bagels but that's about it. Second time I tried their corned beef hash and it was extremely salty and tasted gamey. Plus the waiters were throwing left over water on the tree next to us which started forming a muddy pool which I thought was unappealing. Third time I tried ordering takeout because the pregnant was craving bagels so I called before leaving the house and was placed on hold until I arrived. Realized the cashier was reading the entire menu. Wtf?!? I'm done."}
{"text":"Get the Colorado Benedict! Absolutely amazing and our server Julie was wonderful. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came in an hour before close on a Sunday afternoon. Everyone was very helpful and kind, place was clean and very well-lit. They have a pretty large assortment of alcohol ranging from Makers Mark, Stoli, Tanqueray, draught beer and of course, champagne. There's a little display of bagels hanging in the window right when you walk in. I got the veggie sandwich on garlic bialy, my boyfriend got the egg-a-bagel-pile-up. Food was good, veggies were fresh and the mimosas were just right. His plate was a monstrosity of hot food and mess, but he finished the entire thing (not surprisingly). As we were leaving they were still seating people with a smile, 20 min before close...thought that was great. Can't wait to try more of their bagels and bialys!"}
{"text":"Wonder spot next to the skysong complex! The food and service were great. Interior was very modern with a nice big (dog friendly) patio. Would certainly come here again."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this restaurant. I ordered the potato latkes with fruit and turkey bacon. I ordered my meal to be delivered via Grubhub and was expressed by how fast the delivery arrived."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly crowd and great food. Very hip and chill place for breakfast with more variety and culture than expected.  I can see it being a go-to kind of place. Get it!!"}
{"text":"Excellent first time experience. The staff was very helpful and friendly! This place gives you a refreshing break from the crowded Old Town breakfast joints, and has better food than most of them!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and has nice tables. The staff seems very nice and the bagels are to die for!  The best part, though, is that their cold brew iced coffee is stellar.  I have grabbed a quick bite to go and have been there to sit down and eat as well.  They have a dog friendly patio and it is in a great location."}
