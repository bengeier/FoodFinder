{"text":"There's no place like this in Toronto. Great customer service,friendly staff, great food. Go check out the place if you haven't, it worth seeing."}
{"text":"I went with my wife on Friday night and was very disappointed. When we arrived it was confusing where you need to go to pay to play the games. There was someone playing video games when we came in who directed us in the right direction. Although he yelled to the back from his seat in front of the video games. When someone finally came out they were upset and said to the person playing video games that they were doing the dishes. Very unprofessional attitude.

We ordered nachos and charcuterie which were both not of very good quality. The nachos were soggy and had too much salsa. The charcuterie was trisket crackers and packages sandwich meat. 

The gaming was good, but the seating was terrible. We were given a controller with a short cord and my wife had to sit on a plastic folding chair. I would not return."}
{"text":"Amazing idea and great atmosphere.
BE WARNED If you are going there to play videogames they are missing some crucial consoles and games. You wont be finding Wii/Wiiu/smash/mariokart/marioparty at this place. While I was there with my friends every employee kept talking up how their Xbox is modded and is stacked with a large library of games. Unfortunately every game we tried playing on the modded Xbox would crash halfway through playing. This place desperately needs consoles and games that focus on multiplayer."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went for the first time last night & reserved a booth to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. Got a kick out of the drink names & had fun playing Ticket to Ride. The only thing stopping me from giving this a 5 star review was our server. She had attitude & was rude when we wanted to order drinks throughout the night. She seemed more interested in vaping with her friends than helping us when we wanted to settle our bill. We agreed that we'd love to return but not if she's working."}
{"text":"I remeber when I used to get beat up for being a nerd, well no longer... Now I can go and drink and play video and board games with all the ambiance of my friends basement (well maybe more Heavy Metal Magazines and a better stocked bar)

I can see the concept , I really can and the staff were super nice. Thing is the food was kinda meh and they need more space! Its hard to play games with only two large tables and 5 novelty booths. 

In any case, the staff was good and the atmosphere was fun. If you live in the Junction or area, im sure it's better than trekking down to Snakes and Lattes. I'm up to go back just to try the video games."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me to check this place out and I'm so glad I did! 

As soon as I walked into the shop I was blown away by the decor and overall feel of the space. It was a lot more creative and arts-based than I had originally expected, which made it completely different from the atmosphere I was used to at other gaming cafes/bars like Snakes and Lattes. It's nice to see a shop doing something different and really letting their imagination run wild. The private booths are unlike anything I've ever seen in a cafe before! 

The menu was surprising because I expected typical \"gamer food\" like burgers, fries and Mountain Dew but there is actually a lot more options and even some healthier stuff too. Good drinks too... I ordered a \"Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster\" and a \"Romulan Ale\". Sci-fi drinks! Tons of video games and board games too, but I didn't play any this time. 

It was cool to sit at the bar and chat with the staff, they even taught me how to play Magic. I think I want to have my birthday party here next month! The owner was chatting to me about how she got the place started and I have mad respect for all the hard work her and her staff have put into the space so far. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Tons of seating for small or large groups in tables or booths. The menu accommodates vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores at awesome prices. There's a great selection of board games and my favourite games on console like various mortal kombats, mario kart 64, super smash bros, several CODs, and guitar hero which is good for competitive gaming with a partner. There are also single player games should you choose to come alone. The alcohol menu is also fun. I ordered the elixir of immortality which was served in this really cool goblet with a skull on it. They also had butter beer! There's also a cafe menu for teas and other hot beverages. I would definitely come again and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Crazy but fun. I felt like an uber-nerd, even more so when I realized I had zero knowledge of what the nerds were talking about. Anyway, the food is okay and they will do vegan/veggie. This isn't really a foodie place anyway. The beer list is pretty good and well priced. But it's the atmosphere that is the best. Cool person's party? Worth coming to with a group for sure."}
{"text":"See-Scape is such a great addition to Toronto and the Junction. If you need a unique bar or restaurant space, look no further. They have a full bar and kitchen, board games, video games, and a ton of nerdy events! Karaoke, LARPs, Magic TG tournaments, and bimonthly nerdy burlesque shows all in a female-owned, positive space. Washrooms are gender neutral and on the main floor (heck yeah), and there's no barriers at the entrance. Check out the super unique booths, they all have different themes!"}
{"text":"Fun & kitschy games caf√©/bar with themed booths and tons of board games & video games to play!

The sci-fi/fantasy themed drinks are goofy fun & the enclosed booths are nice because it keeps it somewhat intimate & quite so your group can concentrate on who's cheating in your game!

The only detractor is the weirdly arrogant server that was, for the most part attentive, but became more disinterested and somewhat rude by the end. 

I might go back to play video games all day & not have to talk too to anyone there, that way I'll probably enjoy it more."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to give this place a try and we ended up sitting down for food and played some board games. It's a really nicely decorated venue. The booths were really unique and you can tell they put a lot of effort into putting it together. Food is very reasonably priced and the staff are lovely. Would definitely come back to try out their other stuff."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing place on earth! I once imagined what my ideal bar would be, and this is pretty much it. There's just nothing like it. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, especially the booth. Your group will have some privacy and each booth has a different decor theme. They have a selection of drinks and food. They have video games on top of board games. Comparing to major game cafes, like snake and lattes, this place is a lot smaller and less games to choose from. However, we had a great time, games met out needs."}
