{"text":"Fantastic! I have never had anything but amazing food here. If you choose to go during lunch time, yes, you will wait. If you are not a fan of waiting...  wait till after 3:30ish to go. Or go for a late dinner.. say 8 or 9pm. The portions are very generous, enough to share or take home. I recently had the Beef and Latkes, ate some there and took the rest home for two more meals. I think their Latkes/Potato pancakes are AMAZING. I am also a big fan of their salads (the half size is enough to eat the whole thing and be full and the full size is huge!). I love their matzo ball soup as well. Finally, the desserts are generous portions and more than enough to share - and good!   The waitstaff is friendly and competent. I have never had bad service. Yes, the clientele can be older, but so what? If you are looking for a good meal and don't need to have a cocktail to accompany said meal then this is the place. Laid back. Family friendly. I am looking forward to the opening of their new building (currently in construction across from their current location)."}
{"text":"I was on my way home from work and decided to call Joe's to order a couple sandwiches. I left work called on the way and was on hold until I pulled into the parking lot. That is one. I placed an order for Reuben platters(they do not do that) everything is a la carte? That is two, I said ok, two sandwiches, two fries, $33 something!!! That was the lady straw!  Hello, deli!! Not sure why so pricey. I went to Longhorn's and spent about $65 and got a three course meal for two and drinks! I call a little later just out of curiosity to ask about prices and was put on hold...again! So I hung up. I go online to look at the menu, no prices! Anyway I going in search of Reuben sandwiches tomorrow and not at Joe's!!"}
{"text":"Since I wrote this, Joe's has done both an expansion and a rehab. As Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump, would say, it's YUUUUGGGGGEEE. So scratch the comment about waiting forever in a cramped area-- the time until a table opens up is much shorter, and you're not jammed up against people while you do  The only hitch is that it's now a lot harder for find parking. The rehab ate up a sizable percentage of the lot space. You might have to circle-- or even park on the street to the side.   Hence, I'd now recommend dropping one person off as soon as you pull in-- to get into line immediately-- while the rest circle the lot and walk up."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I'm only giving this 2 stars because of the hummus and the baba ganoush- the best I have ever had. As for the the entrees, I have yet to have anything that blows me away. Just last week, I ordered the cranberry chicken salad for take out. When I opened it at home it seemed as though it was already packaged up for a couple of days. The mango was literally the consistency of a rock. Why anyone would serve that is beyond me. The what I'm assuming to be the pear, was a dark brown color and was squished like a pancake. The strawberries were nonexistent. The grilled chicken was the only good part of the salad."}
{"text":"Joe's Deli in Rocky River is an excellent choice for anyone looking for high quality, delicious food in a slightly upscale (yet still casual) diner setting.  Joe's recently built a brand-new building on the lot next door to their old location, and it has only added to the appeal.  The inside is beautiful; much more spacious, updated and clean (the old place was always very clean, too).   Yes, some people may consider it a little pricey; I do not.  The portions are huge, everything is homemade and fresh.  There is almost always a wait, no matter what time of day you go- this should tell you something!  There is always a large staff working, and service is pretty good... my only consistent suggestion is to 1) have additional staff working the take-out/dessert case and 2) Staff should be a little more friendly... yes, I am big on the whole \"a smile goes a long way\" thing, but there are a lot of \"older\" staff here, which there is nothing wrong with, but they seem like grumpy grandma's sometimes."}
{"text":"Joe's is a Rocky River legacy. The food's good (and generously portioned), however the crowd is on the old side. That being said, you should definitely give it a visit and order the corned beef or pastrami. You'll be happy and relaxed. I haven't been since they opened the new building, but it looks great. Maybe the new design will bring in younger crowds!"}
{"text":"Best reuben sandwich in Cleveland. Piled high and always fresh. I have not tried the other menu items, but the food I have seen on other tables always looks good."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!  The food is phenomenal as is the service, atmosphere, and dessert case!  The kitchen (which is viewable) is spotless.  My favorite item is the Philadelphian (pastrami on rye with coleslaw and potato salad), next would be the matzo ball soup.  All of the sandwiches are fantastic as are the Lebanese dishes (fattoush salad, diwali, hummus) and dinner entrees.  If busy we like to sit at the bar as the wait can be quite long during peak hours."}
{"text":"I have to update my previous review due to Teri a server who took such excellent care of a group of four she made up for all previous experiences with pretensions.   The food was as always Excellent and the service matched!"}
{"text":"Joe's is a American-style family restaurant that specializes in deli sandwiches & Mediterranean cuisine.   Based on the other reviews, it's clear a lot of folks struggle to fit Joe's into their restaurant paradigm, so let me help: First let's consider what this place isn't. It's NOT a dirty, cheap, greasy spoon diner. It's also NOT an upscale, 5-star restaurant. This place is so popular because even though it's a higher price than many family-style restaurants, it's clean, the quality of food is high & the portions are astronomical. Order a corned beef sandwich or a BLT & I promise it will be delicious & you'll have enough food to survive off of for days. Literally days. Other great choices are the Middle Eastern food, salads, breakfast items & dessert.   You will wait for a table when the blue hairs are at their peak dining times during the day. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Over 1 hour from the time I walked in the door until I got the pastrami sandwich - and somehow it was worth the wait !   So don't go for Saturday lunch if you're in a hurry.  Nothing wrong with service but kitchen has got to kick out those sandwiches with a little more speed !"}
{"text":"This is a great place,especially since they reopened with the new location.  Hands down the best Reuben out there, and their onion rings are amazing.  The sandwiches are too big for one person, but I like to split with someone and get the fruit plate.  Great combination."}
{"text":"I was going to take a picture of my most recent dinner at Joe's, but I had already scarfed down several bites feverishly before it even occurred to me to do so. I figured a half-eaten plate isn't as appetizing to look at, but definitely take my word when I say that Joe's gets an A for presentation.  On my latest trip to Joe's, I had pecan crusted chicken with orange glaze. Huge, succulent white meat chicken breast with a crunchy, flavorful pecan outer shell, presented with crisp steamed broccoli, homemade mashed potatoes and gravy, and a strawberry/mint garnish. My dinner also came with a sizeable bowl of delicious matzo ball soup (and 2 matzo balls!). I was so full that I couldn't even fathom dessert, which is a shame because I love my desserts and Joe's has a huge selection of beautiful pies, cakes, and tortes. I even had leftovers from my meal. Generous portion sizes that yield leftovers always a plus.  On other occasions I have tried the corned beef sandwich (incredible) and \"the suburban\", a hearty traditional turkey dinner with fixings. I enjoyed both very much.  While Joe's offers most of the standard deli and diner fare, they sometimes pleasantly surprise with the more atypical, luxe dinner fare offered on special. In addition to the pecan chicken which I ordered, I also saw scallops dijon and beef tenderloins with lobster sauce on the daily specials board among other delectable specials. Not too shabby!   The food is for the most part priced very reasonably. The side dishes might be a little on the pricey side, but hey, they have to make money somewhere.  The clientele, as others have pointed out, tend to be senior citizens. I don't have a problem with that. They know what's good! The decor of the restaurant is sort of a like a Perkins, but the food is so much better at Joe's that that is really where the comparison ends.  I can't help but stare at what other customers order -- everything looks so good and is so well-presented for a restaurant that is essentially half deli half diner. I want to try everything on the menu.   I've been here at least 3 or 4 times and I haven't had a bad meal."}
{"text":"As much as I may go through phases of being sick of Joe's, it's only because I go through phases of going there all the time, because they do have really good food.  Their Reubens are stacked inches and inches high with corned beef (which you can buy by the pound and enjoy at home, too), the soup is hearty and delicious (particularly the chicken noodle), the omelettes are great, and the Cranberry Chicken Salad and Fatoush are staples of my carry-out diet.  I've gone through phases with their desserts, as I believe they've gone through phases with their bakers.  The macaroons, hippie cookies, and certain cakes have been very good in the past, but I'm not sure if they've been the same lately.  Carry out is usually the way to go; there's nothing like passing the swarms of people in the waiting line to pick up a bag full of food ready for you."}
{"text":"Great food, clean atmosphere, good prices  There is no better breakfast on the west side of Cleveland"}
{"text":"There is no such thing as a bad meal at Joes. Today we were treated by our wonderful grandmother to one of the best restaurants in all Ohio. Service was prompt and so very kind, and although the wait for a table is long, it is always worth it. Once seated service is always fast.  Today the table had a special, the veal paprikash  which was flavorful and oh so tender. Pastrami sandwich, with a absolutely massive portion of meat that guarantees even a half sandwich will be filling. Dawali, stuffed grape leaves that were as always unparalleled by any other restaurant I have been to. Fantail shrimp dinner was the final order, perfectly cooked and crispy, with good quality shrimp.  Soups were all fantastic, chicken rice, lentil, and matzoh ball. The last of the three had an absolutely massive dumpling, and was divine.  Overall another wonderful experience at some of the finest dining in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years.  The prices have gone up a bit over the years, but the quality and quantity have not changed.  I love the turkey reuben , which like all their sandwiches, violates the \"never eat anything bigger than your head\" rule.  Breakfast is good too.  You need to get there  in the late afternoon or early evening.   After 5 is insane!  You will have to wait, but it is worth it.  Excellent mac and cheese (Fridays in Lent) and it sells out quickly!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been there, the last time probably 6 years ago. The Porterhouse was on the special menu and for the price (14.95) it was the same as any sandwich with fries. So considering, not a bad value. It came with soup or salad, a roll, green beans and choice of potatoes. The steak was about 3/8 inches thick. The tasty side of the bone was good but the other side had a bit of gristle. It was cooked correctly, medium rare. The green beans were tasty, the baked potato as expected. I had the soup, beef barley, and it was OK but not much better than a Progresso. My fellow diners had fish and chips and a gyro. It was reported to me that the fish and chips came on a toasted bun. What the hell? It was a fish patty, not a real slice of fish. She was disappointed. The gyro was reported as good, and serviceable, tightly wrapped, which is what she wanted. The fries were good and seemed fresh. Total for three on this, just shy of $40, not counting tip. Over 50 crowd for sure. Summary: was not impressed, try harder."}
{"text":"Great food, great portions, great price. I go to Joe's about twice a month. Generally once for breakfast, and once for lunch/dinner. They have good omelettes of the day, oversized fruit bowl and oatmeal. The service is always good. Its a non-rushed atmosphere and a nice stop for out of town guests. You can have a great meal and conversation."}
{"text":"This is a no-frills place, but it's always crowded for a reason. The food is excellent and the portions are huge. The sandwiches were enough for two meals, the fries were handcut and perfectly cooked, and the desserts are heaven. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and stayed to chat. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"My family took me to Joe's when I recently visited Cleveland.  Everything looked great, but I finally settled on the potato pancakes.  Although considered an appetizer, I ordered them as the main course, and was served four huge, perfectly prepared potato pancakes.  I ate two and took two home.    They were delicious.  I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and good deli food is a rarity there (although we have great Mexican food!).  I thoroughly enjoyed Joe's.  Everything that family members ordered looked great, and everyone at our table enjoyed the food.  Kudos to Joe's!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! We live over an hour away but try to eat at \"Joe's\" at least every month.  Soups are fabulous!! Salads are excellent.  Portions are very generous but that means there is a quick and easy meal at home .  Their corn beef is AMAZING .  In the area try, \"Joe's\" .  Closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"A wonderful spot for breakfast! Big menu with all the favorites and a couple dishes that beg to be tried. -- Corned Beef Omlet? Seriously?-- Great comfy feel, and delicious food like Great Gram would serve. Can't wait to come back again to try lunch and dinner!   In looking for a place to stop Joes didn't even pop up in yelp but we saw it and decided to search it. Good reviews but no one mentioned breakfast so I decided to find out myself. I'm glad I did! Everyone seemed to know each other and was very friendly and welcoming! Great service, great food, great value."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my experience at Joes. The quality is top-notch and the service is excellent. Even though it is not a deli in the purest sense, it is truly a Cleveland destination, and I would rate it higher than Corky and Lenny's."}
{"text":"Never again! The decor is tacky, the staff is surly, but for some reason the wait to be served over-priced, below average food is excessively long. My friend found a fingernail in his meal and when we pointed it out to the waitress, she acted like it was no big deal. Free nail with entree, I guess. I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I can't talk about the food or service because the hostess wouldn't seat us due to the fact we were waiting for my daughter to get there. I assured her that we would order an appetizer while we waited and  that my daughter was about 15 minutes away. No go. So, we went to another restaurant that seated us promptly. I'd say that's bad business. They lost out on three people's orders for nothing."}
{"text":"What can I say about Joe's Deli that hasn't already been said? Let me give it a try.  I love this restaurant.  It's good no matter what time of day you are dining. My personal favorite meal at Joe's is lunch. The sandwiches are amazing. They are very large so I recommend sharing. If your going to have dessert and I save room to indulge every time, try the coconut cake or one of the many tasty cheese cakes. The service is always good.  I also have to mention the potato pancakes. They are made to order and fabulous."}
{"text":"Joes has become my go to neighborhood carryout. They have something for everybody. Though it can get pricey, the portions are HUGE. They have a great cobb salad. A \"side\" of mac and cheese is enough for my two kids to split."}
{"text":"As always tonight the food was good but the service was terrible. You can tell Joe's is taking for granted the good business it does because the waits are long, the service terrible and general comatose nature of the staff is not good. We waited 22 minutes to get seated, 10 minutes to order anything, and another 30 for our kids dinners to come out. We asked for ours to go because it was taking so long. Not so much of a sorry from the waitress. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Joe's is simply amazing. Order the California chicken sandwich and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really great food, decor and service. Every time we come to Rocky River,  we eat here! Prices are very reasonable. Soups, large salads, sandwiches, and much more! Service is exceptional! I highly recommend this restaurant. Try it,  you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Have been here for dinner a couple of times and love their corned beef. Similar to Slyman's but easier to get to for me. Came here recently for breakfast and was really impressed. Everything was delicious. I got a basic breakfast and the portions are huge. My husband got the corned beef omelet and that was delicious. This is our new favorite breakfast spot!!!"}
{"text":"I devoured a damn good Reuben, went home, and took a nap. Works for me.  Realizing that the owners are also run Slymans, now i know why you cant just get a seat. Expect a wait of like 20 minutes for a table.  Any day. They day I went. they gave us a pager. I hate that. You're a local joint, not the cheesecake factory..  Service was ok but our server was constantly coming out of nowhere and refilling our drinks. We actually had an extra glass of Coke for some ghost at our table."}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad at Joe's.  Love the grilled tenderloin dinner...my husband and I could split it.  Matza ball and german dumpling soup yummy!  Since they opened the new place, the prices are steep.  My husband spent $10 for a really good chicken sandwich but it didn't even come with chips.  The wait is also very long no matter when you go in."}
{"text":"Ehh, joes can be good at some things, but they are just so expensive. I mean, they charge 13 bucks for a sandwich"}
{"text":"Great diner and deli food restaurant. This a upgrade from your traditional diner. Very clean and dinning area is spacious.  Portions are generous. Service is great. Prices are reasonable. It attracts an older crowd."}
{"text":"Joe's is a staple in my life and rarely disappoints. I've dined in a handful of times but I prefer takeout since there is usually a wait to eat there. The people who work their takeout are always so friendly on the phone and in person and never screw up my order which means the world to me. Nothing is more frustrating than driving all the way back home to discover your order is wrong. What?!  The food is always cooked well and tastes fresh. Their sauces and dressings taste made from scratch and whatever they put in their garlic mayo is addicting so be careful.  Some of my faves are the chicken cranberry salad, matzo ball soup and cali chicken sandwich. They never disappoint. If you're not trying to practice discipline, also check out their desserts. Tons of options and every single one is delicious except the chocolate silk pie (it's not bad just not as good as all the other ones)  Bottom line: If you're a West Sider, Joe's should be on your speed dial."}
{"text":"Joe's has the greatest corned beef this side of Slyman's. Would definitely NOT recommend the extra lean, go with the nice juicy regular! Great turkey as well, love the Matzo ball soup as well."}
{"text":"I decided to give Joe's a chance again, after getting food poisoning last year from there awful breakfast. I heard the corned beef was the best, and up there with Slymans. Slymans has odd hours, and aren't open when my shift ends. So why not go on St. Pats day at 430pm?!?! Parking was a pain to find, but that was to be expected. Surprised it was a tolerable 30-minute wait. Reuben's were had, and they were just ok. My corned beef sandwich seemed a bit dry, and even though I hear its the same Slymans product, it tasted NOTHING like Slymans. That was a bummer. But the service was on point that day and we didnt wait long for our food. So congratulations on your one-star promotion, and thanks for not giving us food poisoning this time."}
{"text":"Delicious food, huge portions, it's easy to see why Joe's is such a hit.   If you go on a Saturday: be prepared to wait!  I went with two others on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30pm, thinking we had avoided the lunch rush...we ended up waiting about 25 minutes for a table, and upon talking to our server, we learned that it's definitely the norm- they have a consistant wait all day on Saturdays.   That being said- the wait was certainly worth it! The menu has a ton of solid offerings that you would think of as typical \"deli fare.\" What I liked best was all of the mediterranean food (Lebanese food?) offerings on the menu.  The baba ghanouj came as a huge serving and was some of the best I've had.  We each left with a container of leftovers (enough for another meal).  The cake offerings looked to die for, if only I had saved any room for dessert!   Joe's earns its place as Rocky River favorite- definitely consider stopping in for lunch if you find yourself in the area."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are HUGE! Fresh bread, good deli meat and great fries! I could only eat half my sandwich and made two more good-size sandwiches with my leftovers!  Salads were good, too. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Joe's several times and the food is always good. This happens to be one of my mother's favorite places to eat. She has cancer and has been hospitalized for quite some time and hasn't been eating. Today she requested a ruben from Joe's. Awesome I thought until I called. I requested that they split one sandwich into 2 sandwiches and said I would pay what ever charges nessesarry. The manager Kathy said that would not be possible and refused my request. I asked if she would the please leave half the meat off the sandwich to which she also refused. So as much as I would have liked to cancel my order I ordered the sandwich and now I will take it to the hospital and have to take it apart myself  for her. Although the food is good the customer service at Joe's is absolutely pathetic and for this reason alone I will not be returning nor will any of my family. Disgraceful!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast and weekday takeout. Incredibly friendly service and consistently good food.   I always go with either the cranberry chicken salad or Greek salad. Their homemade salad dressings are exceptional! Their homemade soups are awesome too - matzo ball soup is on the menu every day. If you go for breakfast, get the fast fare combo - best pancakes on the west side. And go early - breakfast ends at 10:30, and you'll have to wait if you show up at 9:30 or later."}
{"text":"Corn beef piled high and delicious. Dessert case is large and filled with satisfaction for every sweet tooth.  YUM."}
{"text":"oh check this out by darren down below with his write up      darren r. ------best cheese steak ever!!!  this clown from lorain county never left ohio. greasy tony's made one hell of cheese steak that made your tummy ask for more.geno's in philly, pa that has been featured many times all over the country as a top notch cheese steak place.   but we have some clown by the name of darren saying this joint has the best ceese steak. the boy has to be on crack or like most lorain county people, you never left ohio so you can explore places \"for the best cheese steaks ever\""}
{"text":"Coming for 20 years plus. The best high end diner Ive ever experienced. Well prepared everytime and quality. I had a blacke grouper special that was $17 and would have been 2x that anywhere else. Superb. For old schoolers, the liver and onions is incredible. The sandwiches insane size and the best deli meat around. The pasyrami corned beef deli makes my mouth water. Matzoh soup rocks. Even the steaks are good.  Ive never had a bad experience here, EVER. The deserts are divine. Try the germ choc cake. Wow."}
{"text":"Tasty food, awesome atmosphere, great service!  I have never had a bad meal here. The portions are larger than life! I have had the chicken California club, the Reuben, the tuna salad, a burger... All so tasty!  The restaurant is very large and accommodating to  almost any size party. The outdoor patio is nice when the weather is cooperative!  The staff has always been very good. They are attentive and friendly.  If you like desserts... They have an overwhelming display at the front of the restaurant and the few that I have tried have been excellent. (Carrot cake, baklava, tiramisu, cheesecake)  Try it!"}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype of this place. I have been here a total of 6-7 times, and each time I am just not that impressed. The food is average. It's not horrible, but I've had better quality diner food elsewhere. You do get large portions, but those portions are also reflected in the prices. Maybe my inability to see what the big deal is is because I don't eat corned beef, and that seems to be the popular item."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST corned beef in the area!  And, their desserts are beyond delicious!  Only draw back is there is usually a wait...but well worth it.  LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"It's a deli people and I'm rating it as a deli.  For those who think it is pricey, you are missing something.  Order one of the daily specials.  Hmm, is a $2.95 feta, spinach and bacon omelette pricey?  Not in my book.  But, if I want a really good Belgian waffle, I'll pay more.  Their Belgian waffle with various toppings is $6.95.  And for that very delicate waffle that is rich, but oh so light, with a variety of toppings, I'll pay $6.95.  I'll also happily pay $10.00 or so for a very nice hangar steak with sides and soup, especially if the soup is a chicken matzo.  The roast beef sandwiches are humongous.  Sometimes the brisket is a bit more moist that other times.  Yeah, it's a tad pricey for $8.95 or so if you order the full monty, but an average person cannot and should not eat the whole thing in one sitting.  It will easily feed two.  If you want value order the half sandwich with a bowl of soup.  Their half sandwich is bigger than the full sanwich at many places.  The salads are also huge.  The owner is Lebanese and there is a definite middle eastern bent to the menu.  The service is superb.  Had the Belgian waffle there today.  A word about the desserts.  They are huge portions.  The German choco cake and raspberry choco cake are excellent.  The linzer torts are also great.  The desserts are not prepared there, they are from vendors.  The only dessert I would avoid is the Russian tea cake.  It's average and can't touch what you get at Vera's in West Side Market.   Finally, Joe's is one of the cleanest places in town.  I'm there often.   It is the best deli on the west side, bar none."}
{"text":"Joe's is a family tradition.  We've been eating here for over 20 years and it was my late grandmother's favorite restaurant.  Whether it was part of a night out or you were just there to grab one of their outstandingly decadent desserts to complete your meal, Joe's was there and they have something for everyone.  Come hungry, leave satisfied with enough for lunch or dinner tomorrow.  The portions are terrific and the prices are reasonable and don't let the new building fool you they are still serving the same fare that you remember though they are always improving old recipes and staying with the times.  I suggest stopping in for a bowl of their matzo ball soup for starters, then one of their epic reuben sandwiches, with enough meat for two or even three sandwiches, and then finishing up with a slice of the oreo cheesecake or one of their huge chocolate chip cookies.  Come for the food, stay for the memories."}
{"text":"Visited the new location last night for the first time, and was quite impressed.  It's much classier than the previous place, and feels a lot more open.  It looks like they have a nice patio too.  The food is consistently fantastic, and the portions are enormous."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for breakfast lunch or dinner. I've never had a bad meal at joes. This mornings vegetable omelet was cooked to perfection. The coffee is delicious with a never empty cup. Great place to enjoy a meal and read a book."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Best corned beef hash and corned beef sandwich ever. Service is really dry though. I recommend pick up and go."}
{"text":"Beautiful. Hardwood floors, marble bar, and huge. This remodel is very impressive. Service was a little slow, seemed like the regulars food came out quicker than mine (and i ordered first). Who needs prompt service when there is a full bar for some day drinking?  You already know their food is amazing. I highly recommend their salad with avocado, grilled chicken, bacon, olives, cheese's, and a bunch of other deliciousness served in an edible bowl. Also, their corned beef is still divine, as always."}
{"text":"This was my first time and Joe's and specifically went here because of the reviews it's received.  The food was really good and portions are HUGE.  Service was great also.    The place is large and comfortable and we only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated on a Friday afternoon.  On Sat or Sun it may be much busier, but I would think worth the wait.    I'll definitely recommend to family and friends looking for great deli food with a nicer restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"The most amazing corned beef EVER. All the food was incredible and despite being super stuffed after dinner, we opted for dinner. Good move - it was incredible (German Chocolate). Very nice atmosphere, excellent prices, and the service was perfect.   We'll coming back to Joes for sure!!! Love this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My newest obsession at Joe's is the Grilled chicken salad with hot bacon dressing.  OMG.  Tasty, HUGE portion which I never finish and take home for another meal.  Great food as always and bar service is always attentive."}
{"text":"Joe's looks like a nice Perkin's on the inside but the food is far superior! It is a family restaurant type place, usually with mostly an older crowd or a family with children (it isn't a hot date night spot).   Their sandwiches are super yummy and huge! All the food tastes homemade (if it isn't, I don't want to know).    Closed Sundays!"}
{"text":"Great local spot with excellent corned beef and deli staples, plus some Lebanese favorites like grape leaves and hummus. Dessert case full of tasty cakes and cookies as well. Very busy on the weekends, but for good cause. They do well at turning tables and tons of carry out orders."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Always a wait, that tells you something. Great menu, Middle East dishes mixed in with comfort food classics. Make sure you get desert to go, as you will have no room after the large portions. I will get three servings from my takeout carrot cake."}
{"text":"The Food is awesome but its such a large portion and a lot of food. The onion rings are awesome but I am going to tell you one thing don't take them home because when you heat them up they will get all greesy and when your squish them together how all the grease comes out. Lot of cornbeef based on what you order.      Pros' Great food friendly wait staff        con's     unfriendly host staff never greeted with a friendly smile.      Trash every where lot of cigarette buts upon walking in no perfect entrance to make the guest to feel welcome."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Just a deli in a nice building.  You can forget about going if you are under 65 years old. The other patrons won't make you feel welcome.  The inside also resembles a nursing home cafeteria.  The food was just mediocre and for $50, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've driven by the place for a few years and even watched the new addition they built.  For some reason I was never interested in actually going in but I decided to give them a try this past weekend (12/13/13).  They came up on Yelp when I did a search for corned beef in my area.    Just a little background:  I work downtown so if I want corned beef, I have my pick between Slyman's or Danny's.  So needless to say, I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to corned beef.  My wife and I were a bit concerned about the prices.  My corned beef with Swiss was going to be $11 (actually that's right in range of the other two restaurants I mentioned).  Her gyro was (+/-) $10.  Considering we are used to awesome gyros from Maha's, we thought we were overspending.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Joe's corned beef can go toe to toe with Slyman's or Danny's so my only criteria is if I'm downtown I'll go to one of them but if I'm home I'll go to Joe's.  Also, the gyro was even better than Maha's (and keep in mind, we LOVE Maha's!).    We did not overspend.  We got our money's worth.  If you're in the Fairview Park, Rocky River, Lakewood, Westpark, North Olmsted area, you really can't beat this place.  I hope to review more than their sandwiches next time."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant built for those in retirement. The dining room looks like one you would find in a nursing home.   I went to this establishment about two months ago and my experience is one of the reasons why I made this Yelp! account.   I went there with my other half having heard raving responses from friends and coworkers. When we arrived, we were seated immediately. However, there was quite amount of time that passed until our server got to our table. After that, she was courteous and attentive.   I decided on a Greek omelet with an English muffin and hash browns. I sipped on coffee waiting for my meal to come. It was gas station quality at best. When the food arrived, the quality was average at best. The best part was the store bought English muffin.   Unfortunately, 6 hours after eating from Joe's, I became incredibly ill. And the next morning I had to visit the Emergency room. I was told I had food poisoning.   Needless to say, I will never be visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"I never EVER would have thought I would write a NEGATIVE review but here goes. I have been going to Joe's since they opened in the old Kenny Kings building! I have always loved that restaurant. They had good food, and they were very friendly. The only complaint most people ever had was that they need more seating. Years later, they torn the building down and rebuilt a very nice restaurant. Trouble is, I think that now they think they are this upper scale restaurant (Not as many good dinner like they used to have) and it no longer has that neighborhood deli feel. So here is my negative comment. Last week, my kids came in to town and everyone wanted something from Joe's. I called, got a recording and waited,.....and waited.....then someone answered and I said I would like to place and order and she put me on hold. I waited,.... and waited again. At this point I just said screw it and went there to order. I figured it was going to be packed but nope, barely ANY one in the waiting area. So I went to the counter to place my order and this is where I really was taken aback. I mentioned how I tried to call and the woman said well yeah, the phones have been ringing off the wall. I said how I waited and waited and once again she mentioned how it was only the two of them and while taking my order she said, \"|Like now, I can't answer because I am taking care of you!\" *I* suggested they have someone dedicated to answering phones when busy like that! The other woman spoke of defensively telling me how they can't do everything and I was told there was nothing they could do about it. While standing there, the owner was handing orders to them and the woman who took my order told her that I was not happy that I had to wait so long.  She threw her hands up and said \"What do they want us to do?? We are busy! Thank God we are busy\"  So, the beef?  CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I understand busy phones, but you need to ACKNOWLEDGE people that are calling. Don't say I don't know what it is like because I worked in retail customer service for 14 years and I know what it can be like. But when I acknowledged that the person was holding, I also said sorry for the wait, they were understanding. BECAUSE I ACKNOWLEDGED them!  NOT ONE of them even said sorry to me for the wait and the owner? You don't care if your patrons are upset? Fine, not that you will really care, but I am done with Joe's! I will never set foot in the restaurant again and I most certainly will be and have been letting people know of my experience. IN MY OPINION, Joe's tried to please everyone but it backfired on them. They are not, as I said, the neighborhood deli they used to be!"}
{"text":"Had a very good breakfast here today with my wife. I had the cheese omelette - eggs cooked perfectly, but half the cheese wasn't melted at all. Home fries were great and a side of bacon was nice and crispy. My wife had the bagel sandwich special and she loved it.   She remembers Joe's from way back, when it was downtown. Good service, really nice big dining room with comfy chairs bring it up to 4 stars. Will be back to try lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef, Great Variety, So many things to try, so little room even when we share to try more.  Would love the Recipe for their Garlic Mayo really good on everything!"}
{"text":"Joe's Deli is something I remember from my childhood. Yes, most times the booths are filled with individuals MANY years my senior - but that doesn't change the fact that the food and desserts are top notch.  My personal faves are the Grilled Chicken Salad (with Ranch dressing) and the Peanut Chicken Salad (which comes with SUPER delicious Peanut dressing & a decent amount of fresh fruit). I haven't had any in a while but I'm also a fan of the Cajun fries - yummy! The desserts are divine (German Chocolate Brownies, Oreo Cookie Cheesecake, extra large Chocolate Chip cookies, Cassada cake, Apple Pie, the list goes on...)!  There is almost ALWAYS a wait, I don't think I've ever gotten to Joe's and been seated in any less than 15 minutes. But! A solution is on the horizon - Joe's is opening a new & larger location RIGHT NEXT DOOR! They're building an entire new restaurant which is slated for completion sometime in the near future if I'm not mistaken.  The restaurant is closed on all major holidays and Sundays. So, if you're looking for a Sunday brunch you won't find that here, unfortunately.  The waiters and waitresses are great - they're quick, they're knowledgeable, they refill your beverages quickly, they remember your order, and they always offer dessert. The restaurant itself is clean and well kept - it could use some updating, but as I mentioned above - they're in the process of taking care of that!  As of right now (during construction) parking appears to be limited, but trust me if you can't find a spot, circle a few times - this place is worth the effort."}
{"text":"Joe's has a great big menu and the place is huge.   we had dinner on a Friday night a few weeks ago. and, while i don't normally order a sandwich for dinner, i did at Joe's. I had a Pastrami Reuben - which was really tasty - along with some fries and a cup of Matzah Ball soup. Id' never had the matzah ball soup but it's delicious.   I can't remember what Danielle had but we shared some hommus - also very good.  I've already told D that we need to go back for lunch sometime because I really want to try some of the other sandwiches on the menu."}
{"text":"Not sure if it got better or I got more mellow! (Actually, I am sure....it definitely got better!) After a couple of recent visits, I'm recanting my last review. Joe's is a solid deli/restaurant with a very broad menu. Prices are a little steep but meals are so big they can be shared. Service is very competent once you get a table. The weak point is that we always seem to have to wait for seating... sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes 25 minutes. If you can, go there early for any meal. (As an aside, I like their pastrami better than anyone's in town, though I think Slyman's and Goodman's beats their corned beef.) Desserts are also a strong point here."}
{"text":"I've b een going to Joe's Deli for decades, moderately priced and every meal has been delicious. I especially love their grilled chicken with the garlic sauce, humus and tabouli. Their desserts are very tasty too, again every one i've tried was very delicious."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had a very pleasant experience. The service was quick and the food was fantastic.   The chicken noodle soup had great flavor, and a good noodle/veggie/broth ratio. The corned beef sandwich was HUGE and delicious.   We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Joe's food is consistently delicious.  Larger than life portions means \"To Go\" boxes are the rule rather than the exception.  Friendly and attentive staff means no refills left behind!    This is a popular spot so get here early if you can.  The patio is popular when the weather allows (typically May thru September).  Closed on Sundays.  Favorite dishes are Corned Beef and Latkas, Chicken Shwarma wrap with garlic mayonnaise and Special Chicken with hummus and tabouli wrap.  Excellent soups and salads.    Make sure to save room for a Napolean!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Cleveland, it is mind blowing to me this place doesnt have a 5/5.  It is family owned, the service is excellent and the food is amazing.  Do yourself a favor and get the corned beef.  It has a great atmosphere, only negative is there is sometimes a wait, but thats because its so good.  They have tried to counteract this by moving into a new bigger, beautiful space.  GO TO JOES!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and decor upscale. The staff smiled and was friendly. The food was tasty and abundant. I would recommend Joe's for a quality sandwich and amazing deserts."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  They offer a variety of food and huge portion sizes . I have shared a sandwich with a friend and was very full after. I also came her with my husband and left with many take home containers which is unlike us. Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait but overall a tasty place !"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Joe's Deli! We just love it! The place is very nice and always clean (we've been going for the past 7 yrs), waitresses are great and the food is delicious and at a very reasonable price for the quantity. Great restaurant to go to with family/friends. We always take family members, when they are in town to enjoy some of the best food on the West Side! The menu is diverse with some classics and some Lebanese specialties (my favorite!). Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Joe's Deli, what can I say?  I don't know how I've lived in Cleveland for over 20 years and didn't know about Joe's Deli til 5 years ago...  it is by far the best food you can get for your money.  Taste- 5 stars... price - 5 stars, portions - 5 stars, variety - 5 stars.  If you I haven't been, I suggest you go, but not on Sundays, as they are closed.  Also kid friendly.  I have not tried the deserts here, as the dinners are so large I'm always to full.  Give it a try, you'll love it, and its A mom and pop shop!  Keep it local Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Wow from the moment I walked in and saw a geriatric and/or retarded lady drool on herself as only short bus people can, I knew I was in for a special treat.  Extra brownie points for the local regular geezer who showed his head stitches to the hostess.  The hostess then invited Frankengeezer to our table but he declined.  They messed up my order and I never got my raspberry iced tea but hey that's ok.  They're restaurant people.  They don't have an education and Ohio has a low minimum wage.  What can you expect?  The pastrami sandwich was phat.  Almost as good as The Hat in So cal.  All sides come separately though.  Boo!"}
{"text":"While the food might be great, the service is far from superior. While some of the wait staff are good, overall they were highly understaffed and some were rather rude which made the whole experience, unfortunately, unpleasant."}
{"text":"Best corned beef ever. Friendly people, clean and many great choices. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Joe's is in the tradition of classic delis that serve massive corned beef and pastrami sandwiches. But they take it so much further here. If you can choose from the massive menu in under 5 minutes, you're reward will be getting your meal that much quicker, but it's difficult with so many delicious options. I use the word meal here, because the portions you get are enough to feed you for 2-3 more meals, depending of course on what you order. Tonight I had a chicken Parmesan dinner, which comes with a massive salad. The marinara sauce was subtly sweet, and sandwiched between 2 layers of melted cheese, which then was draped over a grilled, not fried, chicken tenderloin, baked, then over pasta. Oh my. Glad I got this instead of the spaghetti which I was really feeling for. Best of both worlds, the pasta and the parm. Eat at Joe's!"}
{"text":"Nice consistent food and portions. Excellent deserts with a large variety. Reubens are the best"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, decent food.  Good place to eat for the Above-60 crowd, judging by the people I've seen there."}
{"text":"Love this place even when there is a wait.Good food, good service and you can make friends as you wait.I am usually sceptical of a restuarant with such an ambitious menue but haven't had a bad thing yet. The middle eastern dishes are so yummy as with everything the portions are huge,but I enjoy leftovers. Wish they would bring the decore out of the '80's but otherwise just wish I lived closer so I could drop in more often."}
{"text":"Everything is made fresh that day. We have been driving past this place for years HUGE MISTAKE!  They have a deli so you can get salads, meats and more to go  CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Columbus, OH and omg this place was amazing.  We started off with the spicy hummus and they served warm pita bread on this side.  I ordered the chicken philly sandwich with fries and was told to get a side of the garlic mayo (can I have that recipe?).  I couldn't believe the large proportions they give you, it's definitely enough to split with another.  Everything was so delicious.  I couldn't stop talking about how great the food was throughout dinner.  The pricing is also ideal! I can't wait to stop my next visit to Lakewood to try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"When you pull up and walk into this place you will initially be thrown off by the decor, which most closely resembles a holiday inn, and the clientele, which is 90% geriatric.  You will also note the hoards of people waiting to be seated, always, at any time.  So these things seem contradictory, odd even.  Old people have time I guess, you think, so maybe that's why they wait.  This place looks sort of pedestrian, but those desserts in the case look pretty f-ing good.    Here's the deal: Joe's is delicious.  GIANT plates, but the fatoush or greek salad will knock your socks off - whatever they marinate that chicken in must contain narcotics.  The sandwiches (also huge) are amazing.  I was initially shocked at how fresh everything looked when it came out, but this family diner has pride.    To put the cherry on top, so to speak, the desserts here are about as good as it gets.  The ebony & ivory and trio are spectacular.  You will not be sorry.  Everything is homemade and they sell it all so quickly, you don't have to worry about freshness.    Tables turn over really fast, so don't fret, take a seat, and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Best place for a great sandwich.  Tried the California Chicken club today and it was wonderfully prepared with the grilled chicken, avocado, lettuce and sauce.  French fries are par for the course, but the onion rings are HUGE and fried to perfection.  Very filling.  Customer service is always friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"WOW! A friend sent me here. I was blown away. I pictured a small old deli. This place is huge and very nice. I sat at the bar. The chicken and rice soup hit the spot on such a cold day. I also ordered the corned beef and Latkes sandwich. I ate half and that was too much. The other half will be dinner. They have the best and hottest horseradish I have ever eaten. It compares to wasabi. Great service too."}
{"text":"When it was suggested I go to Joes Deli my expectation was going to be a small well established hole in the wall. I was wrong! Well established yes, but a very nice family diner. I ordered the chicken & rice soup...homemade all the way. Great flavor with nice chunks of veggies & chicken. I also ordered the corn beefed reuben. I love corn beef, and this might have been the best I've ever had. Very tender, right amount of fat, and juicy. If you are in Cleveland, find your way to Joe's"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants and deli's anywhere, great large menu, reasonable prices, great service, great desserts, large portions, have been there many times, never a bad meal or bad service. Only con, this place is so popular that there is always a wait."}
{"text":"So many things to choose from. But I always order the corned beef and it's always delicious. They also have a dessert case! Try the oreo cheesecake it's worth the calories!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I love more than to dine out at Joe's! They have the most delicious food one could while eating out. If there's one thing that grinds my gears just a little bit is the wait period for your table. Certain days can be a nightmare to wait on, but get past that, and you're in paradise!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. The reuben is delicious, as well as plain corned beef sandwich. We finally ordered the onion rings. Those were so good, we even took the remainders home to pop in the oven the next day.  I find myself spying on other tables to see their orders. I'm going to have to start branching out on my orders.  Place is very clean, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Food is definitely good but my colleague and I had a horrible dining experience this week, again. Here are the issues we experienced: 1. No wifi, it's 2015, they don't even have a decent cellular signal in there. 2. \"10 minute wait\" for lunch yet we had to wait 30 minutes. 3. Once seated for lunch, 20 minutes late, they couldn't serve lunch because they were still prepping and finishing breakfast. So a business lunch that shouldn't have taken more than an hour total turned into a 2 hour ordeal. EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TOO. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fresh and homemade. I don't typically like mozzarella sticks but these were wonderful. Soft cheese that melted in your mouth. Fresh crunchy breading. Cranberry salad is great if you love sweet salads (which I do)."}
{"text":"Found this great deli today...... tables are far enough apart to enjoy your lunch mates without overhearing others.  Good server, and the latkes were like those I've eaten in Europe...thin with scallions scattered thru them. Corned beef and latkes was huge....leftovers for tomorrow. Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Where to start...hmmm, if you are starving and want a huge portion of really good food, come to this place but avoid it during peak hours as it gets mighty crowded.  If I go there for dinner it's at 5:30pm or earlier and for lunch I get there at 11:30am, because otherwise it gets terribly crowded.  Although they remodeled and enlarged the restaurant and the lot about a year or two ago, it still packs folks in like a madman.  If you like corned beef or pastrami sandwiches, well, this place is almost as good as Slyman's downtown.  Most people can eat only half these sandwiches. I love their chicken tenders and fries appetizer.  It's more than a meal for me.  The tenders are better than any other place I've had them.  I believe the wait staff told me the chicken is soaked in buttermilk and then fried.  Very tender and wonderful.  The portion is huge, six or seven pieces, and although I've not weighed them, it seems like about 12 to 16 oz. of chicken tenders to me.  Lots of fries, as well.  Their meals are very, very good.  They have various specials each night and the servers take time describing them.  My single complaint about Joe's is that if you are coming here with three friends, and each of you drives separately, parking gets tough and the hostess almost never will seat me until all of my party is on premises.  I find that rather annoying.  I've been here at least 40 times, including before they did the remodel and rebuild, and I have never, ever had anything that was not really, really wonderful.  Again, not fancy food, not pretentious, simply very, very good and fresh, plus hot food always served hot, cold food always served cold.  This place is also extremely clean, as well.  Oh, their desserts are wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is 5 star all the way...always love bringing people here that have never been. The portion sizes are well worth the money. Take-out is the most efficient I have seen at any restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Joe's is one of those places I first went to 25 years ago and will continue to go for the next 25. It is a tradition. They have moved into a nice new building and there is a huge parking lot. Unfortunately, the lot is needed and I don't think I have ever seen it at less than capacity. The wait is usually ridiculously long, but it's not a big deal, especially now that they have a large full bar. And a dessert case to drool over.   I love their lebanese coleslaw and have been known to order it to go on random days. It is also great for vegetarians, so ends up being a family staple. The deli sandwiches have enough meat on them for 3, so pace yourself. Everything I have ever had is good, and I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"The roast beef is melt in your mouth! And is so big you will have leftovers for 2 days! The matzoh ball soup is the best! Get there early. It's always packed."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a child, and it is always delicious! The corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup is my favorite, and honestly I have never gotten anything else!"}
{"text":"There is nothing bad to say about Joe's.  This was my first visit and definitely not my last.  I visited here with my grandson on a cold rainy Saturday in December.  There was a 10 minute wait when we arrived, but as we were waiting the lobby started to fill up with customers and the wait time increased, we must have arrived at a good time.  We were seated, after our short wait, immediately approached by a server.  I ordered a bowl of the chicken noodle soup and an order of tabouli.  My 4 year old grandson requested a burger and fries.  Our food arrived just a short time later and OMG, the servings were huge!  The soup was delicious, skinny noodles, which were firm, not at all mushy, flavorful broth and lots of chicken and veggies.  The tabouli, was tasty too, and a MUCH larger serving than most places serve, especially for $7.  I ate as much as I could and still took more than half home with me.  My grandson's burger came from the kids menu, but it was huge, with a nice serving of fries.  He loved it!  Upon leaving, I stopped at the counter to get a few pastries to go, and upon arriving home and tasting....very, very good.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Love joes! The German dumpling soup is amazing, actually everything at Joe's is amazing! Never had bad food or bad service!"}
{"text":"We love Joe's food.  Place is always crazy busy, used to dine in now we can never get a table and carry out is starting to become a pain in the ass.  Have to call multiple times and the wait is always so long on hold .. 1 hours sometimes for carry out, Anyway what led me to write this review was on Saturday we were going to dine in, it was around 2:40 pm wait was 30 min hubby didn't want to wait so we carried out, ran an errand and came back.  Got it home and the Ruben sandwich was so small!!  Now normally we wouldn't care, but I mean it was small and I called spoke with the manager and she couldn't of gave a rats ass.  I know they get the business but $14 for a Ruben and it's made small and you just wave it off like no big deal kinda made me mad. Their only response was bring it back.. well i wasn't driving 40 min round trip when I had already waited over an hour.  Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here with the wife and our daughter.  Nice open seating area where a high-chair isn't an inconvenience.  The pastrami and traditional Reuben were both excellent.  The little one loved her chicken fingers, though I think she liked the corned beef even more!"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to Rocky River my husband and I have been exploring many new places and this has to be our favorite. We've been here several times and the service is always great and the food is incredible!"}
{"text":"Being from the east side and familiar with the good old school delis, I was a bit hesitant to give this place a try.  I was happy to see the well lit and sparkling clean space.  This is quite impressive as was the menu.  I did stick with the staple of matzoh ball soup and a corned beef sandwich.  Both were quite good and had ample quantity to fill my belly.  The soup was hot and full of chicken as well as some parsley and onion (not typical but still tasty).  The corned beef (1/2 sandwich) was more than enough for a meal on its own.  I did not try any of the amazing looking deserts, but they looked great.  Now on to service.... Possibly the best I have ever received in a deli either here, or in NYC.  Our server was spot on accurate and was friendly and knowledgeable.  A must visit should you find yourself looking for some good comfort food on the \"other\" side of town."}
{"text":"Decent. Huge menu with a ton of options but Mediterranean is my ultimate fav so I opted for the grape leaves, fattoush and hummus. The hummus was tasty, fattoush was decent but the grape leaves were horrible. I hated them. They were ice cold with way too many fillers. I like them more meaty and warm. Overall, not a bad place though and I will be back to try more! Good prices."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Joes and certainly not our last. Huge portions, easily split with someone or have enough for the next day. Roast beef was so tender with creamy homemade mashed potatoes gravy and fresh green beans. Chocolate cream pie was awesome! You actually get 1/4 of the pie! Definitely had to split! Was delicious but portion was to huge!  Atmosphere was very nice and the decor was very attractive. Went to Joe's yesterday 04/03/15 and tried the Matza Ball soup--first time ever having this soup and certainly will not be my last. The Matza balls were tender and flavorful and the soup was full of veggies and chicken and undoubtedly the best soup I have had anywhere in a long time!"}
{"text":"We have been to Joe's Deli twice and both times have had some of the finest corned beef we've ever tasted.  Both times I got the \"Ruben's brother\" due to my lack of fondness for saurkraut and both times it was outstanding.  While the sandwiches are a bit pricey, I always get 2 meals out of them as big as they are. My wife had the corned beef & cabbage and for her it was THREE MEALS, so well worth the amount paid.  Now we want to go for breakfast & get some real corned beef hash, not that stuff most places use out of a can!!!"}
{"text":"Good luck getting your to go order call answered. I called and called only to face a busy signal half the time and to be put on hold RUDELY twice. I held on the line for 12 minutes before getting hung up on. I understand this place is busy but at 4 pm on a Monday? Seriously get another few phone lines and some cheerful people to answer the phones, not some that says please hold and just puts you on hold with nothing but the annoying redundant recording! Will not be attempting to order take out or visiting this location ever again."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to have this place in our path on our way to the windy city Chicago. Upon entering the restaurant I quickly noticed the age group of the majority of the guests were a lot older than me being 24. Just a funny thing I noticed but not enough to drive me away from dining here. Good thing too because the food was excellent. The portions were huge. Almost too much for someone like me who can really put it away. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and fries. Not very many places can have a lot of success with amazing fries which are my favorite part of the meal, but this place hit the nail on the head in that department. I would go back just for the fries. I did not dine in but I was able to notice the restaurant seated area which was very appealing and pleasant to the eye. For a nice restaurant like this, I was kind of surprised they offer take out but very thankful."}
{"text":"Joe's is full of good people who will go out of their way to treat you well. The staff is friendly and attentive. Absolutely great food and hospitality. You may have to wait to dine in during their busy hours, but it's worth  the curious stares and glances from other patrons who seem to lack patience and inner peace. Joe's is a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"A great place! If you are a local you already know about this but if you are traveling from out of town and are nearby this is a definite must visit. No matter what time of day there is always a wait so be prepared. Sandwiches, entrees, appetizers. All are good and the amount of food is too much. If there are just two of you get an appetizer and split a sandwich or entree. If there are four of you get an appetizer in two or three meals and share. The staff is always nice and they know the menu."}
{"text":"I feel so old saying that I've been to both Joe's, but I'm so glad that over the years this restaurant hasn't changed a single bit. You really can't go wrong with anything that you order here. To start, get the sampler with the pita, dips, and grape leaves. It's a lot of food, so you'll definitely want to share if its not your main course. Their turkey sandwiches are bomb, as is their matzo ball soup, so the mix and match is always a solid choice. Joe's also makes really great salads too. Anything you get with their chicken on it is a wise decision because the marinade they use really give its some great flavor. Since there is usually a wait, kill some time taking a gander at their dessert case and tell yourself you deserve it."}
{"text":"I went twice to this place. Both times the restaurant is clean and the serving is good. Food is Lebanese and it's so yummyyy .. highly recommending this place . I'll always order sheesh tawook and kebbah. Amazing amazing"}
{"text":"Outstanding meal at a reasonable price.  Soups and sandwiches are always great.  The Joe's pastrami was sitting under the heat lamp too long.  The toasted French bread was completely soggy.  Bit disappointing, but everything else lived up to the Joe's high standards."}
{"text":"Joe's is unexpectedly amazing.  From the street, it looks like a Denny's knock off, but if you let that fool you, you will miss out big time.  The place is immaculate inside, and the staff are all very nice and helpful.  I was starving when I arrived with my family, and it's a good thing, because they have one of everything you want to try on their menu.  My mom got the babaganoush, which I had never eaten before, and I was in heaven when I put it in my mouth.  My son had a damn near perfect grilled cheese (eat your heart out, Melt Bar and Grlled), and my other son had the kid's pizza, a perfect sized little treat.  My wife had a really beautiful salad with gyro meat on it, and I, well, I had the most amazing sandwich.  They call it Joycey's--pastrami, corned beef, Swiss cheese, on rye bread.  This monster arrived to the table towering a full four inches above the plate.  I am not usually a fan of sandwiches that explode all over the place, but this, this was special.  I really did not mind finishing up with a fork.  It was that good.  The only criticism I could level at Joe's is that the portion sizes are a bit daunting, due to their sheer enormity.  This seems strange for me to write, I mean really, I'm thinking of deleting the whole sentence, but something tells me to leave it in.  Their prices are a bit higher than typical diner fare, but the portion sizes let you know that they are not trying to steal from you.  Pro-tip:  Make some space in your fridge for the bag of leftovers you will be bringing home with you from Joe's.  The take home (hah, that's a pun right there): Joe's is one of those places that remind me why I love Cleveland--genuine greatness, with not even a hint of pretense."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my grandmother today and was unfortunately disappointed?. Despite the excellent service the food was underwhelming which is especially unfortunate considering the huge portion sizes. I start with the German dumpling soup which was quite bland and texturally unpleasant. I ordered the chefs special pork tenderloin stuffed with spinach pine nuts and Parmesan cheese. I've never met a pine nut I didn't like and unfortunately the pork tenderloin (at least the one on my plate) never met a pine nut. The Parmesan was all on top of the meat and so it was the first thing to hit my nose and the pungent odor really put me off. The pork itself was overcooked."}
{"text":"Met friends here for dinner wait was not long service was great waitress (Betty) was new but she did a good job if you eat here come starving because you will get a lot of food my appetizer could of been my meal food is delicious always leave so full"}
{"text":"My friend and I head straight for Joe's Deli whenever we contact each other. It's the only place we know to go where you get good food, many different meal options, fair prices, and wonderful services. The Mediterranean platter is to die for. And the desserts oh don't get me started on that! Everyone should head down to Joe's Deli and have a meal at least once...you'll keep going back for more!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, corned beef (extra lean) is a favorite.  A little loud for conversation but great overall!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on Saturday and was pleasantly surprised.  The menu has a large variety of choices with many American choices and Mediterranean choices too.  I am a sucker for grape leaves (Dawali) and had to try them.  They were very good and I am a tough critic.  I ordered the turkey reuben as an entree and it was delicious.  The food was all of high quality.  There is a lot of mentioning of the wait there, and my experience there was no exception.  We had to wait 35 minutes and were told it was a 30 minute wait.  We got there at 1:30PM which is generally a rush hour so a non-peak time would likely be better.    The service was also very good.  The waitress was nice and efficient and we didn't have to wait long for our food.  I think it was less then ten minutes for our entrees.  Can't wait to try more things there, just maybe at a different time of day (or week)."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with whatever you choose on the menu. From breakfast to awesome huge corned beef to the best desserts around you won't leave hungry and you'll definitely have leftovers. The portions are generous!"}
{"text":"Joe's would not be out of place on Long Island. It serves large portions of diner food with a smattering of deli and is owned by Middle Easterners. Like East Coast diners Joe's has at the entrance  excessively sized  overly decorated sweet desserts in a glass case. And like Long Island or Jersey Joe's puts its own spin on many of the classics. The matzo ball soup comes to mind. In trying to make its own mark it over does it.   The sandwiches are all excellent. Clevelanders who only go to  Slyman's for corned beef it's time to wise up. I have over heard the Joe's manager tell a server that Slyman's was sending over more corned beef. These two restaurants along with Joe's on Madison are all in the same family so no surprise they serve from the same pot.   For those who live west of Bunts Joe's seems to be where to go to meet a friend, or to not have to cook, or to satisfy a craving for good old American food. Service is good, prices are a bit high but at times that is a good thing. Joe's does not attract the quiet old drunks or the loud young drunks that low price diners do.   Families sit at tables here where three generations all manage to find something to their liking. And they keep coming back. During peak hours there are lines waiting to get in the door.    I have had many a Reuben and hot brisket dinner here. They beat those at Jack's on the East Side any day in my book. The only time I do not particularly enjoy Joe's is weekdays for breakfast. Too many white collar workers come here talking loudly of boring white collar things.  The menu is overly ambitious so the best bet is to keep to diner or deli food passing over Hawaiian or Italian dishes."}
{"text":"I went here for a work celebration at lunch time. It was my first time at Joe's. Everything was on point. We ordered some hummus and onion rings for the table. Yum! The onion rings were HUGE! I got the cheesesteak and french fries. Portion sizes are outta this world. Even the to-go containers are fabulous. The steak sandwich consisted of big chunks of rib eye & filet mignon. Very tender and tasty. Our waitress did a fabulous job! It was uncanny how our drinks were magically refilled. She had great things to say about working there, too. She said that they treat their employees really well. The place was packed. Give yourself a few extra minutes to find a parking spot if you are going near meal time. We left with our bellies and hands filled with deliciousness and leftovers. We ran past the beckoning desserts, but ended up going back after visiting Lakewood Park, to pick up some sweet delights for later!"}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef sandwich I ever had and I'm 65 years old and have hade many Corned Beef sandwiches in my lifetime."}
{"text":"First off its always busy here, i drive by during the week and its packed in like sardines on tje weekends. This place is a happening joint especially since they remodeled a number of years ago. Service is usually genuinely fast and courteous. Food is amazing, everything that ive had never had a complaint. Been coming here for years."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for a large group at work and everyone was happy with their lunch. I had the corn beef and as usual, it was AMAZING!!! Always a generous portion and delicious. The other orders included the Tuna Melt, BLT, Club sandwich and grilled cheese kids lunch. The order was ready for pick up when promised.   I live in Rocky River and have been eating at Joe's since they were in the older building. The new place looks amazing! I've read other reviews with complaints about the long wait and \"clientele 55+\". The new building is much bigger than the old one because it was such a popular place. The fact that its so busy still should tell you something.   The desserts are also very good!!!"}
{"text":"The prices keep me from eating here more often. Not that I can't afford, but it's just expensive diner food. Two chicken finger baskets, a club sandwich and two bowls of soup came to $40! It's good, but not THAT good."}
{"text":"I used to go to Joe's former location a long time ago with my mom. My family has went to the new location several times now.   The first time that we went, I was quite surprised at how big the place is, especially compared to the old place. They fill it up though!  It's always been busy but we never had to wait. The new place is definitely different. It has more of a fancy restaurant feel than a deli/diner like the old place.   The sandwiches and other food is still excellent. They still pile the sandwiches high, especially the corned beef. Most places could make three sandwiches out if the corned beef that Joe's puts on one!  The service is good. One time we did wait a while before someone took our drink order. The server eventually apologized and said that she didn't realize that it was her table. Other than that, the service has always been quick and friendly.   Come hungry or plan to take some home!"}
{"text":"Having lived in NYC for a while, I have always been very critical of places that indicate that they are delis, I somehow equate delis with NYC for some reason. Furthermore, most places that I have found outside NYC would like to consider that they are New York style delis...well, 99% of them are not. This is where Joe's comes in. When you order a sandwich, a salad, or any meal for that matter, you get more than what I feel I pay for. The portions are generous to a fault. My only complaint is that I never have room for desert on premises. I'm only creeped out a little by the ('eastern European'?) guys who seem to hover nearby waiting to swoop a plate from off the table in front of you....yeah, I know you gotta bus the table but geez, I'm sitting back relaxing and adjusting, don't swoop in on me like that! But I'm obviously not creeped out enough to not go back, I just have to remind myself they aren't stalking they're just doing their jobs."}
{"text":"I went to Joe's on Friday night and left feeling just \"meh\" about the experience.    The inside of this restaurant is confusing.  It is really elegant and clean, looking like it could be an event hall or hotel restaurant. But the clientele was in loungewear and the cuisine isn't exactly high-end.  It just was a hodgepodge of everything.  The food itself was okay, but nothing special. Portions are generous, so they justify the price.  I ordered the downtowner with beef and thought it was good, not great.  The beef was kind of dry, so the gravy on top was definitely a must.  The mashed potatoes were pretty bland, as well.  But all combined and drenched in gravy, it was good.  It was a nice meal that would constitute a comfort food meal at another time.  Our service was unimpressive, as we didn't see our server for long periods of time when drinks were empty or we needed our check.  Overall, food was okay.  If I had a specific craving for comfort food, this might be in my consideration set."}
{"text":"Overly large portions of very mediocre food. I think the appeal here for the mostly senior crowd is the opportunity to get several meals from their lunch/dinner order. I'm not a fan of sandwiches so massive that you could make 3 normal sandwiches from the filling. The California chicken club I ordered had avocado on it. I'm not sure who thought putting an entire UNSLICED half of an avocado on a sandwich was a good idea, but it is not. It was impossible to eat, and the entire avocado half slid out first bite. The tabbouleh was the most bizarre interpretation of the dish that I've ever encountered. It was basically all chopped parsley with some onion and tomatoes in the marinade/ dressing. Where was the bulgar? I hadn't been to Joe's in a couple of years, and I think this may have been my last visit."}
{"text":"I like Joe's Deli. I have been here several times now and no real complaints. A tip would be to arrive before 5:30pm if you want to dine-in, otherwise this place gets busy fast and you will have to wait with a small crowd. Also, keep your eyes closed until you get to your table, if not, you will see their huge case full of cakes and delicious baked goods that will tempt you into adding an unexpected 1,000 calories to your night.   Staff is A-Okay, I think they try their best even when it gets crazy busy. Food is good too. Nothing smack-you-momma spectacular, but always satisfying. It's like simple, fresh deli food with some Mediterranean dishes mixed in. I've had their Mediterranean Platter (with Tabbouleh, Hommus and Baba Ganooj), the California Chicken Club, and their Tuna Melt. My friend got one of their salads and it was huge and looked delicious. I also like that they let me swap out the french fries for coleslaw.   I will continue to stop in every once in a while and I suggest you give it a try as well (especially if your grandparents are visiting, old people love this place!)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, and it was packed.  Initially given a 45 minute wait time for our large party, but before we could leave, they informed us that a table opened up and we would be able to sit in 15 minutes.  Nice save.  The overall atmosphere/theme of the restaurant is...interesting.  It's like three people got together and said what they wanted in a restaurant.  One said middle eastern food, one said a deli, and one wanted a bar.  Joe's has all three!  Service - basically friendly, and very efficient.  Had my soft drink refilled without my asking twice - love that.  Despite how busy the place was, our food got to our table in a reasonable amount of time.  Food - pretty good, actually.  Onion rings were okay, and the combo platter had some good stuff.  My reuben was meaty and not too dry.  Had trouble finishing it, which is unusual for me.  Some of the sandwiches do not come with a side, so head's up.  Not a problem in my case, as I didn't want them anyway.  Solid chance we'll be back at some point..."}
{"text":"Always love this place.  The food is excellent, and the portions are amazing.  The food is a bit pricey, and they can really be jerks about seating you, but it's so good.  The people who own this deli are from the same family as the people who own Slyman's, so if you are a Slyman's only Clevelander, you'd do well to give this place a try.  There are so many things I'd recommend, their corned beef, their chicken noodle soup, their french fries, their salads, their muffins.  You can't help but want to get dessert when you come here, especially if you're a sweets fiend like I am. Their cakes are amazing, and there are always a ton to choose from. The slices are always huge, so you can theoretically order one, eat half and have a nice little treat for the next day.  I'd definitely recommend this place, just make sure you are either in a patient mood or are there during off hours."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! Fantastic corned beef and pastrami sandwiches. Their soups are always wonderful. Best matza ball soup in cleveland."}
{"text":"I just can't give Joe's enough love! Don't let the fact that your grandma probably recommended it to you deter you! Though it has an old school vibe, Joe's is serving up some of the best food on the west side! The moujaderah is to die for. It's less than $9 and it will feed you at least twice--even better it's one of the best bites in Cleveland. Take a bite of the lentils and slaw together with a pickled beet wrapped in a warm pita. This is the CLE experience right here.   If this isn't your style, they also have great soups (tried a great navy bean one today), huggeeeeee corned beef sandwiches (just in time for St. Patrick's day), and an amazing selection of pastries and desserts!   If you're a foodie in Cleveland, Joe's is a must."}
{"text":"This place has the bomb Ruben sandwiches.  Me and my husband went there to try them out, and we are hooked.  Very nice inside and the crowd is casual.  You got to try them out, you will not regret it..."}
{"text":"Joe's Deli is a 10/10. Went here with my family for dinner and all of us were blown away. Some of their prices might at first seem a bit steep, but you get exactly what you pay for because potions were HUGE and everything tasted better than any of us expected. My sister got The Suburban meal, which is basically a thanksgiving dinner, and cleaned the plate. Their Dawali grape leaves and warm pita appetizer was a classic and all of the sandwiches that the rest of us had were phenomenal. Then on the way out, we each picked a dessert from the case to go, which was incredibly difficult because they all looked so beautiful. Having since tasted them all, every one is fantastic. Their tortes and cakes are classic European-Style that are not too sweet Luke American desserts. We can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"This place should be call Joe's Deli and every thing we serve is bigger than your head.  This place makes some of the east side deli's look like subway! My Philly cheese steak was more like a roast beef Philadelphia cheese steak.,f,  I could only eat half of it.  Fresh roast beef, shrooms  peppers, onions . and half of Wisconsin's cheese supply,it was fabulous served with perfect fries, hot, and crisp.  Next time I will order some of the Lebanese stuff!  This was enough for 2 people, easy!  The lady, I mean a lady ordered a tuna fish salad  it was very good, came served on grilled rye!  She also ordered a bloody Mary,  it was very unique.     The corned beef sammies that came out were, well bigger than my head. That will be next try!  Thank you Joe!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the over the phone customer service. Called in to place a large pick up order and was hung up on when I said I had to call back to finish my order. Definitely going to spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant. There is nothing bad on their menu. Saturdays they have German dumpling soup and it is out of this world. The staff is great and so friendly. Very inviting. There is always a wait to get a table and theres no question why."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a sandwich person but with all these great reviews on Joe's, I had to give them a try.  My family wanted corned beef but, they ran out of it. Luckily for me, they still had the pastrami that I wanted to try. I got the hot pastrami & the cajun fries. The pastrami was tender & very juicy. It was seasoned perfectly & tasted so good with the ciabatta bread it was on. The sandwich was big! I could only eat a half of it. The cajun fries were pretty tasty too.   The waitress gave my family & I free desserts since they ran out of a lot of things since it was almost 9pm when we came in for dinner. I got the Buckeye pie and wow, that pie was so light! You can tell the crust was homemade which I really like.   Good food, great service, & a beautiful restaurant...I'll be back soon to try another sandwich & a dessert!"}
{"text":"Consistently great American cuisine. Be sure to check out the glass case at the front with all their baked goods."}
{"text":"I like this place...not for the decor or the ambiance but because they seem to put an effort into putting out a quality product.   Their soup is fresh tasting and flavorful, the portions...huge (3 people could split a sandwich platter for god's sake) and if you are into meat....they do not skimp.    I went there once for St. Patty's corned beef and it was the best I've ever had.   The desserts....uhmmm...do you like desserts?  Cause if you do, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the least.   One note...the clientele noticeably....shall I say....were on the hefty side in addition to being on the other side of 60...obviously two demographics that know good tasting food.   Bottom line...great place for comfort food and a folksy vibe."}
{"text":"One of my favorite take out places! The food is out on time when they say it will be. I usually get the turkey club and I always love it.  I've had the corned beef a couple of times and I love it with a lot of extra mustard. I went for the pastrami sandwich once but my poor European stomach can't handle the massiveness and greasiness."}
{"text":"The food is all around legit and the portions are no joke. Plan to take friends and share your meal, trust me, you'll have more than enough! Nothing too healthy frou frou but enjoyed it all the same. The corned beef sandwich was heaven on earth, but the portion is enough for 4 people. The price is $13.50 and the portion reflects it. Everything is larger than life. It was a good stop as we visited Cleveland for the first time. Stop by for some delish food and be prepared to take friends to help eat all the food or take boxes home with lots of leftovers."}
{"text":"Well I have never given out a 5 star.  This is one. From the place to the food and service.  Everything is top shelf all produce was great. I had the fish dinner special.   So tasty.  It was perfect.  You can also get Vegan dishes.   Like tabouli.  The mediteranian vegatarian combo or th mjadura.  Its so good.  Love Joe's"}
{"text":"I love Joe's.  I have been coming here over 15 years now. On this particular trip, was my first time at their new location.  I love the new location.  Very open, bigger seating area, however the waitress wasn't the greatest, but overall from every other time its been amazing.  The food is awesome -- alot of food for the amount of money.  Must save room for dessert, or take it to go!!  I love their Poppyseed Rolls when they make it around the holidays.  I brought all my bridesmaids here after we went shopping for dresses!  They all loved it.  Must check out!!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Saturday's German Dumpling soup is by far my favorite.   I ordered the roast beef half sandwich with it. Had to ask for au ju, which surprised me. But still a good sandwich.   I like the philly cheesesteak, but don't love my cheesesteak cubed (prefer shaved). Picky, I know.   Desserts are to die for. Cake, pastries, baklava - yes all of them.    Still, great quality food. Loyal fan of Joe's!"}
{"text":"Three stars may not seem so much. But some places just are three-star places: solidly in the middle of the road, comforting when it's just not a night for fancy eating, there when you want something quick and simple.   Joe's is *almost* that.   The food I've had at Joe's is competent diner food, but the prices are on the high side and the menu has ambitions beyond diner that the kitchen doesn't quite meet. Personally, I would be happy, to see a smaller menu and prices in line with diner food. The price range is moderate, but the food is more in the quality line of good, cheap dining.   I will eat at Joe's again - some days it's just the food that I'm looking for. But if I find something close by that would serve as a substitute, my patronage might move on."}
{"text":"Joe's is a favorite of mine, especially for lunch. They give you huge portions (I always end up with leftovers)! The menu is large, with a wide array of sandwiches, melts, burgers, salads and soups. Let me say that I am a huge fan of the german dumpling soup! I have always had great experiences with the food and service. I'm always tempted by the dessert options in the dessert case up front. I usually walk out with a slice of pie (or two)!   The restaurant has been nicely relocated and the inside is tastefully decorated, with large windows, plenty of indoor seating and a patio for the warm months. The downside here is that on a weekend, you should expect a wait of 20 minutes or longer for a table during the lunch hour. Not a bad wait, considering how worth it it is! Except, parking can be hit or miss. There isn't adequate parking on the weekends, even though the lot is a decent size.  Regardless of the parking, I would come here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"This is a American n middle eastern food combo.  Ambiance is good  Ample parking space  As mentioned in other reviews Saturday Sunday are busy so be prepared to wait 25-30 minutes Staff we had was very nice  Appetizers are good to share for two people Food is amazing but serving size is HUGE. I mean I can eat pretty decent size but still it's huge serving that's why I see everyone walking out with Box food ....  Will definitely repeat ...."}
{"text":"It's been quite awhile since I've been to Joe's Deli! I love consistency, especially with restaurants. I had my favorite grilled cheese steak on a toasted hoagie roll. We're talking thick slices of tender steak, smothered with melted cheese and sautéed mushrooms. #DELISH .... Served with great fresh cut French fries & served with s huge, delicious deli pickle! The atmosphere at Joe's Deli is quite comfortable.... Soft lighting with easy music playing  through the restaurant. Our server, Tina, was very courteous, hospitable & friendly. It's half the pleasure of eating out: hospitality. Lina, our hostess, was quite pleasurable! The menu is vast, you may want to look at menu on their website before your visit. Desserts are to die for... #SCRUMPTIOUS  You will be taking food home with you, whether it's your leftovers or dessert. #Nice      #SatisfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to be raving about this place but to me dining experience there is like a Notebook movie. I watched it because everyone else did, was told it is so good it will pop my heart seams open, and I felt nothing. Who knows maybe I am a robot. Similar phenomenon here. I keep coming back for the miracle promised by others and instead get nothing spectacular. Breakfast is very average. I always judge the quality of breakfast by potatoes - these ones were one mushy stale fried yesterday clump - homefries/hashbrowns kinda deal which you have to drown in ketchup to tolerate.  Eggs were regular eggs, toast was regular toast, and coffee was gas station quality. Of course fans will tell me to shut up and get  me some corned beef - because it seems like it's a Celion Dion of their dishes. But I don't want corned beef, it's a little too heavy for me at 9 am. Not everyone was born a corned beef eater.  Dessert looked grandiose however my friend warned me that it's not really homemade and way over-priced for a frozen pie.  The only consolation that I didn't have to wait in line to be disappointed. I probably wont come back. I am a believer that no one should work that hard  to fall in love."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this week. I've heard so many nice things about this place, I needed to try it. Looks gorgeous inside, very clean, very friendly waiters, and everyone seems to be eager to make this a good experience. We ordered a burger and liver with onions and bacon. The food was well prepared and tasted excellent. I am from Germany, and Germans eat their liver with grilled onions and apples, not with bacon, but I got used to that over the past 18 years. We took two pieces of the best pie I've ever seen home for later, one was a chocolate mousse the other a three layer chocolate cheese cake. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"For crying out loud what the hell is up with this place!   I was told it was the best darn diner, sammi joint I could find near Lakewood, seems to be always crowded, so the my girl and I walk in.   Big pies....8 refrigerated feet of big frickin pies...huge tall pies   Now...being a diner geek..I'm excited cause big pie means big plates of blue-hair style grampa grub!! AMERICAN DINER FOOD!   We see a chalk board whilst waiting for a table...dinner specials w/ lobster or shrimp, medallions of meat...$10-$15...hmmm could be a real joint serving gourmet DISGUISED as a diner to keep foodies away.   We are told by the hostess that these items start a 4:00pm, and it's now 1:45...sorry...   hmm why put the damn chalk board out w/o a time ......   We are seated at the last booth near the service station....we are not vagrant, drunk or both!, and the diner is half full.   Big menu and BIG prices. Lunch sammis are $7-$13...$.50 for cheese, $1.50 for fries on a $6.75 burger..extra lean corned beef add $1.50...higher priced than NYC or Seattle....Can't wait to see the holy fricken grail of diner experiences..   White cloth napkins wrap cheesy flatware on our stained bare Formica table...get me out of here!   But no!...girl is hungry, and everyone is kinda whispering cause it is so quiet...waitess takes our orders: Mine a $7.95 cod sammi w/fries, hers a cheese burger w/no fries.   Now starts the fun!...   Both orders come with fries, we ask the waitress to to bring the girls back, so as not to waste them...she argues that we ordered them..after a debate she says \"fine\" and takes the girls plate back to the kitchen to dump off the fries..comes back and serves her..We try to be nice...thanks, sorry etc...but just get a um humm from her.   Burger overcooked, fries VERY good, fish sandwich: thin triangle of cod , lettuce / tom...and three bones I pick from my mouth...fucking gross!   We don't say anything to piss off our now hostile server....   Now the coffee: I have had this crap before at Denny's, some diners on Rt. 90, and my car repair guys waiting room. Basic Sysco 2 oz packet to brew 12 cups in a BUN machine.... when fresh..no taste or aroma, thin the color of tea. When old... burned, darker and just as tasty! Ours were burned for $2.00 a cup.   Towards the end of the meal, I mentioned the bones...showed them to her on the plate. First she seemed shocked...then ( remembering the famous french fry war of a 1/2 hour ago no doubt) said and I do not lie..this shit cannot be made up \" thats common - you'll have that with fish\" WTFFFFK!...I told her I should have ordered the boneless fish sandwich for $.50 more instead of the semi-boneless one!!!!!!! she LAUGHED and found me quite funny...and handed us a $22.00 check.   Oh dear mother of reason....tell me WHY people eat here more than once....or lets open up an Emperors new clothes boutique next door!!!   ps...  we passed on the pies"}
{"text":"Great corned beef sandwich but service is not that good. Food is also pricey but good quality so I would not worry about paying too much for something you would not like it."}
{"text":"I could eat at Joes every day!  i usually get the Jeanette's favorite combo and some onion rings.  My wife usually talks me in to dessert.  It's easy to realize the quality of food at the first bite, but the service here is even more amazing!  They are always busy, but always seem to have someone ready to wait on you.  My wife and i had our rehearsal dinner here and had a wonderful time.  The Joe's staff paid great attention to detail and made sure all our guests were taken care of.  We always want to take people here when they are visiting.  Good job Joes!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a fluke. We were actually headed someplace else and as we passed by, our friends said \"oh let's go to joe's it's so good\"  It was good. I had matzo ball soup and 1/2 a chef salad - both were delicious   My husband had a Reuben and he said it was so good he hardly used any 1,000 Island dressing.   We both had cheesecake for dessert. I had raspberry and he had pistachio. They were both good. (unfortunately I forgot to take pics)  We would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I love everything I've tried here. From the soups and salads, baba ganoush and hummus to the amazing prime rib, nothing beats the value and quality! Their desserts are also very amazing!"}
{"text":"Believe the reviews that say the place is outdated and WAY over priced. (Although I'm not sure you'll ever see them, because I strongly suspect this is one of the businesses that pays to bury bad reviews.) It is diner food at best, and the service is seriously lacking. The last time I walked in for a to go order, I waited 45 minutes for a side of mashed potatoes. To clarify, I had not called ahead, but that simple side was my ENTIRE order. The counter workers were baffled that after waiting 30 minutes I'd expect to get my order to go before people that were waiting on multiple full dinner orders. I said the word \"triage\" and got a blank stare. And finally, with gravy the order cost something like $8. The man working the counter said he was family to the owners, but that the manager was only there Monday through Friday during regular business hours (just like in any successful restaurant, right?!). I remember when the place was smaller, quaint, and the prices were reasonable. Save your time and money and go to Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Variety, quantity, quality, service, value...Joe's has it all. But if you get there at the wrong time, be prepared to wait. Our party of six each got matzoh ball soup (the best!) and either sandwiches, a Middle Eastern platter, or quiche. The corned beef (ask for lean) is some of the best I've had, anywhere. Desserts are beautiful. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"The Greek salad is huge, flavorful and authentic. Definitely try one of the massive deli sandwiches..hot or cold. The chicken sandwiches are soooo good. Homemade soups, desserts, breads. This place is a must if nearby. Their parking lot is always full for good reasons!!"}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner and I had to force myself to wait til I got home to write the review. This was so pleasantly surprising!   We waited 20 minutes at 5pm on a Friday which is acceptable and the place is big so it being busy was a pro for me. The service was a solid 4 stars, the girl was very sweet and brought me a sample of the German Dumpling soup before ordering it and it was so good! Chicken stock base but creamy, with small dumpling/gnocchi/spaetzle. So good.  My roommate and I shared two appetizers, the fried mozz and the potato pancakes. Both were phenomenal and home made fresh as was very obvious. The waitress let us know the potato pancakes (4 large) take longer to come out. But that was okay because it meant fresh! Crispy, yet soft with apple sauce and sour cream - delicious. The fried mozz were also freshly breaded and fried right then. Also amazing.  For my meal I only got a baked potato which I literally didn't take one bite of because I was SO full already but it looked delicious and baked correctly with a salty crust! Took it home without touching it and it will be perfect for lunch!   My roommate got the chicken philly and fries and was HUGE and looked delicious. Fresh grilled chicken and veggies covered in gooey cheese!   Go here! I will many more times."}
{"text":"Joe's is probably our favorite breakfast spot. The food is excellent and the atmosphere, for the most part, is fantastic. That being said, they could improve on a few things. 1. They open at 7, but there is not a host/hostess during the first hour; 2. The music does not fit the venue - they play a lot of old 70s rock/pop, which is not enjoyable for breakfast; 3. The coffee is awful -probably the worst I have had (and I've had my share of bad coffee). The servers and staff at Joe's are top notch - they work hard and are pleasant. Being a frequent visitor, it would be nice to see them switch up their breakfast specials."}
{"text":"I don't come here often, but when I do its to take my grandfather. He's pretty sick and can't remember much, but he loves to go here. Every time we go he likes to sit at the same table and he tells the same story of how he met my grandma. The food is great, but I think part of the reason I love this place so much is  the memories I have there."}
{"text":"Consistently good food here and extremely generous portions! I had the matchmaker (bowl of soup and 1/2 salad). I chose matzoh ball (2 big matzoh balls) and the cranberry chicken salad. My dinner companion opted for a full salad of the Cobb (he claims it's the best he's ever had and he usually orders it here). Anyway, my half didn't seem significantly smaller than his. Pleasant and efficient staff. We can always count on a good meal here."}
{"text":"Just had my birthday dinner at Joe's. Lebanese Delight was an excellent appetizer. Salad was fresh, Matzo ball soup was fabulous. I had grilled pork chop, my partner had the rainbow trout and it was all to die for. Dina was the greatest server, be careful  I might try to steal her away. Kudos the chef and staff. Beat meal in a longtime.  We will be back. We are taking leftovers and dessert home."}
{"text":"Last time I will be going there enjoy the 7 dollars you overcharged me and wouldn't fix the bill. West Park native under the age of 45 too. Went there tonight thinking it would be an easy dinner for two at 8pm. No such luck, ordered a patty melt with fries. Wife ordered something that came with potato chips she ordered the fries instead of potato chips at a healthy price of $3.50 additional. So we wait for 20-25 minutes. (It is taking uncharacteristically longer than expected tonight but no big deal) Then our meals come. \"We gave you chips, I hope that is ok?\" \"No Id prefer french fries\" \"Oh I am sorry we ran out of french fries\" Ok no big deal. The patty melt came out. I ordered Medium it was medium rare (subtle difference but I didn't want that much pink in the hamburger. Of course it is leaking all over). So I sit there and think to myself. This place really isn't customer focused, I've had some \"take it or leave it attitude\" at this place before but nothing like tonight. I wonder if they are going to still charge for the french fries my wife added. I told the waitress \"Id like you to tell the manager that I am not happy with the substitution.\" She tells the manager and comes back. \"Would you like Cole Slaw or a Salad?\" \"No, no thank you\" So, Whatever I had a hamburger for 11 dollars. My wife is sitting there trying to make the best of it with the deep fried potato chips. Then the bill comes. Guess what is on there. Chips came with her meal. On the bill. an extra 3.50 for the additional french fries we didn't receive and my 11 dollar hamburger. I was told as I was handed the bill how sorry she was and that she told the manager. The waitress said \"You can talk to the manager and see if they will do something for you. I tried\" she said. I paid the bill in full and tipped the woman 20% it wasn't her fault and the fear in her eyes were enough for me. Enjoy the 7 dollars. I am (No, was) a weekly customer there where I bring colleagues after hours. Tonight was my last time in there. So if you encounter a \"customer is always wrong attitude\" you can remember I warned you. Ill be calling visa to dispute the $3.50 charge as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Joe's last week for lunch. It was his first time and my zillionth. My company used to be located in River, so we'd eat at Joe's all the time. It's been 15 years since we moved, and you know how out-of-sight//out-of-mind goes... so I sort of forgot about Joe's now that I don't drive by there. But my husband loves corned beef, and we were in the area at lunch time, so the light bulb went off over my head and to Joe's we went.   WOW have things changed (for the better) since I was last there. The building is totally new and up to date, there is a great waiting area (be prepared for a wait, but it's always worth it) and they separated the hostess desk from the to-go desk:: super smart.   Anywho, on to the review: in a nutshell, we LOVED EVERYTHING! It was a rainy day, so we both had soup (his: chicken noodle, hers: chicken & rice) and they chock full of veggies and flavor. Homemade soup never disappoints, does it?  He had the corned beef and latkes (A+ on taste and the portion size was ginormous -- enough for a full second meal the next day!), and I had the grilled chicken deluxe (yumz -- but sub out the garlic mayo for BBQ). The service was with a smile, as always. Now that I've got Joe's back on my radar, it will definitely be part of our regular rotation. EAT AT JOE'S :)"}
{"text":"I went there when they first opened the new restaurant. We were seated right away. We waited 10 minutes before a waitress approached our table. We ordered. There were four of us. We waited 35 minutes for our breakfast and when we started eating we found everything was cold . Ice cold. Our waitress finally came back and we told her. She said she would talk to a manager. She came back with 2 coupons for a free appetizer or a free dessert. We left. We went back last week and had breakfast. My husband ordered an omelette which looked like an envelope.There was no way that was a three egg omelette. The coffee was awful as usual. At 2.25 a cup it should be a great cup of coffee but it is really vile. No more specials, no more fresh flowers, and a cut back of food for breakfast. This is not a new improved Joe's. The old Joe's was better."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend right before the Luke Bryan concert. I had a chicken sandwich and fries. This place doesn't disappoint. The fries weren't soggy and seasoned right. The chicken sandwich was juicy and full of flavor. I even got a huge pickle with my meal. The waitress was great and always checked on us. There is always enough seating at this place, and fluffy people friendly seating. My friend got a salad and she was very pleased with it. She said it wasn't soggy and had the right amount of dressing on it. They also do takeout because I've had a turkey sammich and fresh fruit salad a year ago. My coworker at the time bought me lunch and said eat this because it's the best. It was HUGE! And the fruit salad was great. While I was there I was checking out the menu because I am dieting so I wanted to see if there was healthy options and there are a lot of options. I can't wait to go back there again for dinner!"}
{"text":"Love the remodel and worth the wait. Corned beef Reuben is impressive. I wish they had German dumpling soup every day! Excellent dessert case. Always good service and fair prices. My favorite deli on the west side."}
{"text":"I just ordered a Philadelphia.  I got pastrami on an old cebatta...roll.  I called and woman was rude asked me 3 times what I ordered.  I am tired I do not want to drive back. This place is horrible phone service horrible service."}
{"text":"Since my first review, Joe's knocked down their aged building and moved into a spiffy new one across the parking lot. Their good looks now match the food quality, and apparently people have noticed; it is damn near impossible to find a parking spot during their peak hours. My husband and I stealthily waited until later on a Saturday night to go, which proved to be a smart strategy. We got right in, sat at the beautiful granite bar, and chatted with the friendly servers while we mowed through our food. One of the specials was walleye cheek, nicely done in a panko breading. I haven't seen that many places, and they do it well, so get it if you are lucky enough to catch it. I had the vegetarian Lebanese platter with spinach pies, tabbouli, grape leaves, and hummus with a giant stack of pita. Everything was magical, but the hummus especially was to die for. I wisely ate about half my dish and packed the rest to go, because I just had to try a dessert. Yes, the baklava is as good as it looks. I'm glad I finally saved room for dessert."}
{"text":"be prepared to wait at peak hours but also be prepared to find the food worth the wait .. I have only been here for breakfast a handful of times .. that does not get my rave review for food .. but their lunches & dinner selections are always top notch in terms of both taste & quality .. their hummus appetizer is the best around .. their corned beef is legendary .. their chicken salad & tuna salad (tuna melt is way yummy) are both freshly prepared & delicious .. their soups are home made & you can tell .. the only thing they can improve on is parking .. can be a bit of a top commodity on those busy peak hours .. + wish they were open on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Sandwiches are awesome. Service is great! We have been here for breakfest and for lunch and everything has been excellent. The bread from the deli is so good, make sure you buy a loaf as you leave. You won't regret it! I can't wait for the new Joe's to open. This place is so good and popular they need more room! Try the Jeanettes favorite it is so good.....you won't be able to eat it all.  Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Joe's Deli is on my route home most days of the week but I had never stopped in. Finally, a friend suggested we go and I took up the opportunity.  I've only been here one time, but it was a good enough impression to bring me back again. It's a family restaurant with a lot of space and large windows for letting the sunlight in. There's also a patio if the weather is being cooperative. Food portions were great, prices were reasonable, and the food was pretty darn tasty.   If there's a cheesesteak on the menu, I'm trying it. Joe's has one of the better ones I've tried but the steak is in chunks as opposed to shaved. This makes it a bit chewier than your standard cheesesteak. Lots of cheese which is a must. They also top it with mushrooms and onions.  It came with fries that were crisp and tasty. The meal was big enough that I was able to take half home for a second meal later. Portions are important and I feel you definitely get your money's worth!  I'm coming back to check out some of their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Comparatively speaking, the new building is swell, the old one had more personality. The food portions shrunk, the prices grew. Adequate service.  Tasty food. Desert selection shrunk, cake wise."}
{"text":"A city staple in my book! The Reuben classic is top 2 in the city, for me I go back and forth between here and Slyman's - a difficult choice to say the least. On Saturday's the German dumpling soup is divine especially in the winter.   This review does come with a warning, if you plan on dining in expect a wait to be seated at any time you go, and be in no rush for food due to the very \"laissez faire\" atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"Joe's is a dilemma for me.  I love family owned, local diners and restaurants (I dislike chains in comparison).  The food is good, BUT in my opinion, overpriced.  On my most recent visits, I had a tuna melt and a Greek fetish omelet, both tasty.  I've had the reuben as well, which is one of the West Side's best.  On my latest visit, service was a bit on the slow side.  I don't know if they have gone upscale with the newest remodel, but I can find just as good tasting food, served faster, and much cheaper at so many other NE Ohio eateries and diners.  That said, I continue to patronize Joe's from time to time, because I like the atmosphere and food there, and like to spend my money on local businesses, not chains."}
{"text":"One of the best deli's in Cleveland.   We have been going there for years enjoying our favorites like matzo ball soup, corned beef sandwiches, Reuben's and the chicken salad. The desserts are wonderful too. If you leave Joes hungry it is your own fault!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best hot pastrami sandwich I have ever tried.  It was simple yet fantastic.  They just moved into a larger space next door to their old place and I really like the new building.  The grilled chicken sandwich I tried was very good too."}
{"text":"Love Joe's!! Never a bad meal!  Joes expanded about 2 or 3 years ago and thank God they did!  They could probably expand again because they are always so crowded! The food is excellent.  Always.  They have such a wide variety of food which makes the place enjoyable for everyone. Everything from Lebanese dishes to Italian to corned beef and matzo ball soup! They have daily specials that are always amazing.  My only complaint is that you have to depend on your waitress to tell you the specials.  They used to have them on a board when you walked in but they stopped doing that.  Why not have them on a board on a paper in the menu?  It would just be easier for the guests and staff. Anyway, usually when a menu is so diverse, a restaurant doesn't do any of it very well but Joes nails all of it.  Definitely don't miss the corned beef. It really is some of the best in Cleveland.  There are members of the Slyman's family who work there so that may have something to do with how good it is.  They usually have a daily quiche that is also a standout as well.  I also love their matzo ball soup.  I usually have to get a cup every time I go.  I haven't even mentioned the desserts yet - oh my goodness!!!   They are in a case right when you walk in and you can't help but notice them!  They are always a standout!  I'm usually too full to eat one there but they are happy to get you a slice of something to go.  Worth the drive to Rocky River for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the great joys of living on Long Island (or, for that matter, in the entire tri-state area) was the huge number of incredible diners.  They were almost all run by Greeks, had menus that covered the entire gamut from a light breakfast to a lobster dinner, and made food that was just flat-out outstanding.  I doubt they were all great but, boy, the diners I visited sure as hell were.   Went to Joe's last night and while looking at the menu said to my wife, \"This is the closest thing I've seen in Cleveland to a New York diner.  They even have matzoh ball soup,\" which isn't exactly a staple of West Side restaurants.  Actually, it's not a staple of East Side restaurants.   So we both ordered some and I added a half a corned beef sandwich.   The soup was decent. Not great, but not bad either. My departed Italian mother made MUCH better matzoh ball soup.  Crazy? Well, my stepfather was Jewish, and they both loved it and she learned from his relatives.  So maybe I set the bar a bit high.   The corned beef sandwich was 1) cold 2) considerably below average. Yes, I know, I know, I ordered corned beef west of the Cuyahoga so what the hell was I thinking. I was thinking a place getting good reviews for corned beef might actually have, you know, good corned beef. Kind of like my review of the Corned Beef Cafe in Broadview Heights.  Ahhh, the  triumph of hope over experience. Anyway, if Mr Brisket's corned beef gets a 10 (actually, it should get an 11, it's louder you know),  and Corky & Lenny's gets a 9, then this would get about a 3.    The pleasant and professional waitress immediately offered to get me something else so I opted for the turkey sandwich.  It was a perfectly fine turkey sandwich, or would have been had I ordered it at Dave's Discount Deli and Hardware House. For god's sake, what's so hard about cooking an ACTUAL FREAKING TURKEY and then cutting some off and putting it between two pieces of bread??!!! Really, what? And if that WASN'T a turkey roll they served, then how did they make it taste like it was made by DuPont instead of Heritage? Oy.   So will we go back? Maybe, probably, who knows. I DO know, however, that it won't be for the corned beef or turkey sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Joe's with my dad for years and have yet to have a bad meal.  Everything is good at this place.  The staff has always been very friendly and the service is out of this world good.  I really have nothing bad to say about this place other than don't trust the reviewers that give this restaurant a bad review.  One of the most consistent/best restaurants in Cleveland.    My recommendations: Hommus Onion Rings Tabbouleh Matzah ball soup Reuben classic Joycey's Shish ta wook Beef and Latkes (must get if you've never been) German Dumpling soup (only on Saturdays) Fattoush  Anything with corned beef  P.S.  If you get sandwiches make sure to try their thousand island dressing and Düsseldorf mustard as well.  Both are homemade and excellent."}
{"text":"BEST PHILLY CHEESESTEAK EVER!!!! Been coming here for years. Very inviting environment, friendly staff and huge portions for the money. I highly recommend the corned beef on their potato pancake. It's what I used to order every visit until somebody told me their Philly cheesesteak was the best they ever had. They were NOT lying! I will start by saying that I stopped ordering Philly cheesesteaks because I was always left disappointed. Either there wasn't enough meat and just all bread, the steak was tough, and one time I was even served steak-ums on a bun. Not cool! Well the search is finally over. I'll never order a Philly anywhere but Joe's and Philadelphia if and when I ever make it there to visit. Joe's, simply amazing!!"}
{"text":"Joe's is the spot! Everything is amazing! Not one disappoint at all!   Even better that Jody is a server there, I'm happy that she has come to work for Joe's, she is top notch!"}
{"text":"I heard about the great corn beef at Joe's and had to see if it's better than the other popular sandwich shop in the greater Cleveland area. The corn beef was very lean and generous portion. I could only eat half. The large deli pickle was delicious! Service was a little slow due to the large lunch crowd. Beautiful new building! The variety on the menu means I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss Joe's, now that I've moved! It's a definite go-to, whenever I find myself in OH.    Wonderful, everything!  Great sandwiches, salads, onion rings (dear god- the onion rings!) and ridiculous deserts. The soups are to die for- I usually buy some to take home, they're that good.  The best corned beef sandwich, anywhere (always order extra lean), ridiculous salads and meditarranean dishes...I've never had a bad meal here....and now I'm craving it from afar!   Great, friendly service- wonderful food and spacious new location...go!"}
{"text":"Joe's Deli has an interesting atmosphere, by everything else is pretty bland.  I'm going to start this by saying that the atmosphere and feel is nice and relaxing, its on the same level as Hansa, comfy seating and nice lighting prevents it from having a cheap and dirty feel. I think hat a lot of work went in to making it comfortable to sit down and eat.  The food on the other hand is bland at best. My food tasted fake and flavorless. It filled me up quickly but left a bad taste in my mouth.  I was a little disappointed with the fact that you can't substitute a side for onion rings, even with an up charge. This is stupid and makes no sense.  I can't say that the restaurant is bad, just not a place that I'm eager to return to."}
{"text":"This place is gem! Nothing like \"the standard deli\" at all, so many great choices, I came here originally because I wanted a pastrami sandwich and it was amazing.  I left with the idea of what to eat next on the menu! Great choice!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name, Joe's is much more than a deli. They are a full service restaurant with a bar. Be prepared for a wait to get a table. This huge restaurant is always packed but well worth the wait. The menu is huge and be sure to ask about the specials. Start with soup. It's what they're known for. I always get the turkey club which is literally the best I've ever had. Order fries with garlic sauce. The garlic is strong but delicious. Save room for dessert too. They've got an overwhelming dessert case of many amazing options. The service is always friendly. For a large restaurant, it's amazing how everyone is treated as family. Don't skip out on Joe's. It's a must visit restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and expected a Normal lunch of good food and service. This place exceeded my expectations and the food was amazing. Their burgers are so juicy and yummy! I also had the sweet potato fries that were super tasty. This place by the way was packed at 11am. I totally understand why there were so full of people at that time now especially after eating there. We love it and I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Prior to our first visit, my wife and I drove by Joe's at least a hundred times since we live in the area. I always had the impression that it was a cottage cheese, english muffin and fruit bowl kind of place since it always seemed like the people that went there were pushing 80.  Oh, how wrong I was. We decided to give it a go for lunch one day and were blown away. The baba ghannouj was the best I've had with a really creamy, smokey flavor. Just perfect.   I got the pastrami reuben and it was outstanding. The portion was huge, so I could only eat half - but hey, that meant the other half was for dinner (and, indeed, it ended up being just that!)   Joe's is definitely on our list of top places we'll go to on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This was the best service I've had in years. Corned Beef Reuben was absolutely delicious! I'm definitely coming back to try some of their other dishes soon!"}
{"text":"No, definitely not a Lebanese restaurant that I thought it was going to be like. And yes, definitely is like a Perkins.  Having been in the Detroit area for the six years, and having experienced the great Middle Eastern and Lebanese food that Dearborn and the east side of Michigan has to offer, I wasn't impressed with Joe's.  First, this really does look like a Perkin's, or one of those American style large restaurants (Old country buffet without the buffet?). It can definitely seat a lot of people.  Second, the portions are huge! My friend got the cranberry chicken salad- it was alright, her chicken was really dry though. I got the fatoush salad. No, next time. I felt like they literally took a whole lemon and squirted it all over the salad. Way too sour. Not sure what went wrong and why was this so .....not like other fatoush salads I've had? I had a major stomachache afterwards as well.  If you're looking for a sit down family restaurant, then this is a nice place. However, if you're looking for a Lebanese food experience, no, no, not the place to go. However, the American food was decent...."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is amazing and it brings me back to the NYC delicatessens that I grew up with in the 1950s.  Their corned beef sandwich is the size of my first born (16\" Long and 12lbs 3 oz.) Because I am a large and religious man I do the Noah Philosophy (eat two of every everything) at other restaurants, but due to the portion size I only eat one of everything here.  The last sandwich I ate there should have just been placed in a hub cap because a normal human size plate could not handle it.    Now here is why I gave it 2 stars: it's because of terrible parking lot and the old people that go there.  Over the last 10 years I have been waiting for these blue haired people to die off so I can get a parking spot, but I swear they are multiplying. Maybe Joe has found that fountain of youth because no matter what time I go there, there is some old man with a walker rolling into the place.  There is never a parking spot and when one does open up, the old farts somehow beat me to the spot.  Last month I circled around for, no joke, 20 minutes. At the end I was following some old women with two bad knees for 5 minutes to get to her car (the car was only 30 feet away when I started to followed her). Then I waited another 5 minutes for her to get in the car and back up.  When she finally pulls out of the spot, a 200-year-old dinosaur steals the spot with his 1980's 4-door Cadillac.  I left the parking lot and have not returned.  Maybe I'll try to come back in another 10 years when I'm in a wheelchair."}
{"text":"We were told about Joe's Deli two years ago, and so thankful.  Sad it's taken me this long to write a review, but Joe's is one of our favorite places to dine.  I don't think there is anything we've had there that we didn't like, from their corned beef, hummus, philly cheesesteak, to their salads.  Consistently good food, great service - again one of our favorite places to dine.  Only down thing is the wait - but that is the case when a restaurant is consistently good, people will return!"}
{"text":"You can always get a quality meal at Joe's Deli. They have fantastic salads, soup and bakery. I've never had a a poor meal here. The service is always great!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer for at least 12 years but all I have to say about it now is that prices have gone up, quality has gone way down. I always get carry out as I live right down the street and it is always too crowded to wait. The last two times I went and picked up my order I have found you do not get condiments with your meal, no butter or sour cream with a baked potato, no tartar sauce with fish. The very last time I went I had food poisoning within an hour of eating fish there. I am done as a loyal customer and will not be back. I am sorry about that too as I would pick up a meal there once a week."}
{"text":"I was here with my family years ago. We didn't think much of it. I met up with a friend here today and was blown away by the corned beef. Great sandwich although it was expensive. My friend had the pastrami and it was great. I would stick to the deli sandwiches here, it sounds like some of the other menu items made people mad."}
{"text":"Obsessed with Joe's! They also do an efficient job with takeout orders always fresh. Their grilled chicken is amazing I always add it to salads if it doesn't come on it already!"}
{"text":"My man's last day of business and we were looking to get ahead of the rush hour traffic and our butts back to Michigan. So while he finished up, i looked on Yelp for a place to pick up a couple of sandwiches for the drive. Joe's came up and we were not disappointed.  A turkey on rye and a club on wheat with the mayo on the side for both. they came with a fruit salad and some chips. About a 20 minute wait at 4 pm on a Monday.  Filled us up and then some. Very good eats When i jumped in to pickup the food, i saw a huge open restaurant, looked inviting. But Minus one star for the woman at the counter/cash register.  It was not very busy, no line at all. I stood there while she was crabby with another employee for several minutes.... something you should not be doing in the front of the house. When she looked up at me, I got not a Hello.... but a \"what did you need ? \" If it was not for the fact we were hungry and looking to get going, I would have told her nothing now and walked out."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Server didn't even tell us there were specials. It was almost 4, but she refused to see if the kitchen would cook me their fish, which starts at 4. The soup was good, I asked her about the roast beef. She said it was great. It ended up being served on a cheap \"kaiser bun\" and was that rainbow roast beef. It was so dry I couldn't even chew it soaked in au jus. I will never go back. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Joe's Deli for over 15+ years.  I'm happy to give them a review based on my lunch a couple days ago.    I sat at the bar and I wish I knew the super nice woman who literally works behind the bar during the week every time I visit there.  She is awesome.  I'm going to edit this and add her name here next time I visit.  She's that good.  Even with a full bar she manages to take care of everyone equally.  Tells you if it's going to be a minute when she's busy and takes care of everyone in order.  The fact she will acknowledge you is half the battle when busy.  She is a master at this and it's a skill.  When you walk in there is a large take out counter to the left with a a slew of desserts in a case.  Host/Hostess stand is to the right.  There is always a wait for a table here.  Regardless of time of day.  They do an excellent job of turning tables so the wait is never too long.  The decor reminds me of walking into a place in Las Vegas with the columns and lavishness of the tables and seats.  It's very welcoming.  The food is outstanding.  In the past I've had their homemade soups, sandwiches (lean corned beef is the best I've had on the West Side of town), appetizers, etc.  All are made fresh with fresh ingredients and it shows.  For this visit I am going to detail the Fattoush salad with chicken (picture attached to review).  I know I can order a half salad of any of the salads.  I just can't bring myself to order a half Fatoosh.  It's so fresh and tasty.  I can tell they had someone chop and wash the greens that make the base.  I can taste parsley and mint.  With what look and taste like homemade pita chips mixed in.  Mini English cucumbers, red peppers, onion, radishes.  I have them omit the tomato and pickled turnips as I'm not of fan of either and they happily accommodate.  Grilled chicken tenders come out on the side.  They are usually very tender with grill marks on them and were marinated in something very good.  The dressing on Fattoush is a nice mix of lemon juice, olive oil and garlic.  Even when I put gum in my mouth after eating this I can still taste the garlic in my mouth.  It doesn't bother me in the least.  The turmeric adds a perfect compliment to the tartness of the lemon.  This is easily the best fattoush salad in town.  One tip about the salads.  They started to bring the dressing out on the side.  You should tell your server if you want the dressing mixed in or on the side.  I prefer it mixed in.  Everyone has a different preference on that though so tell them yours.  If I had any issue with Joe's is they don't let you do a salad and sandwich combo.  That isn't enough for me to knock them a star.  I just wish I could get a Fattoush and Corned Beef combo someday.  This place is just awesome."}
{"text":"I work down the street from Joe's and it's become a regular visit for me and my officemates. The first time I had the Philadelphian--a giant hot pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and it came with fruit salad. It literally took me two days to finish it because it was so much food. Excellent quality and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Consistently good service, friendly staff and excellent food. The portions are ginormous, especially if you get a sandwich, so you definitely get what you pay for at this establishment. Breakfast is just as good as dinner. The corned beef hash is a stand-out in my mind simply because they use actual corned beef and it isn't mushy like so many other ones I've had at other restaurants.   My only complaint is that there's no bike parking. I wish they had a rack off to the side somewhere, but it won't deter me from ever going! A word to the wise- get here early to find a table or do take-out if it's during peak hours. They pack the take-out bags like champs making sure your soup doesn't spill and sandwiches aren't crushed.   Joe's Deli, I love you."}
{"text":".....FIVE STAR ALERT  .....FIVE STAR ALERT  .....FIVE STAR ALERT   Today, I just ordered---but could eat only about 25% because it was HUGE---one of the tastiest and most satisfying casual luncheon dishes I've ever been served in a restaurant.  It was---literally---my very own mini buffet on a large oval plate---their LEBANESE DELIGHT.  At 10.95, an incredible value, and a bright, neon-flashing 5 STARS.  Easily, enough for two very hungry appetites, three normal, or 4 to 5 as a starter.  And beautiful-looking, too---splashes of reds, pinks, greens, creams.  Perfectly, artistically composed.  An unseen food-plating master with the eye of Matisse is busy being creative somewhere behind that swinging kitchen door.     Presented in cups and on bright green leaves of kale or chard, here's a list of all the wonderfully fresh elements: *  Spinach pies (2 biggies) *  Hummus (nearly 1 cup) *  Tabbouli (nearly 1 cup) *  Pita (two 12 inch, quartered) *  Pink pickled turnip sticks (4) *  Stuffed grape leaves (2 big) *  Tomato slices (3 big thick) *  Strawberry (1 big fat one) (Their yummy hummy beats the baggy middle eastern pants off my homemade.)  We also ordered the JEANNETTE (another 5 star)---an EEEnormous mound of very good, thin-sliced (smoked ?) turkey*, swiss cheese, bacon, tomato, and lettuce on a croissant.  One huge half (eaten), another huge half (for two servings, later). Came with a fresh fruit salad of melons, grapes, blackberries, strawberries, and blueberries.  All that, and a pickle, too.    *  Interesting FYI observation worth noting. Cannot honestly recall if restaurant menu specified as such, but the web menu does not.  Web states \"turkey\"---but no mention of it being \"smoked\".  It tasted smoked---or it was the best roasted we've ever had.  (Can't get through to them by phone, to confirm.)  Whenever you can---from restaurants or deli counters, choose SMOKED over roasted.  In my not-always-humble-opinion, smoked always tastes so much better than roasted, which can often have a strong or gamey taste.  This sandwich did not taste like that.  I never liked turkey until I tried smoked.   Maybe Joe's serves BOTH for anything with turkey---what they happen to have available might be what's used.  Not necessarily wrong for them to do this, since many find the roasted just fine.  But some of us don't.  If you've ever had a turkey sandwich here, and it didn't quite succeed in the flavor department, it might have been *roasted*.  Maybe give them another try, but tell them that you want only if it's SMOKED.                                                      ONION RINGS---another 5 star.  Possibly nearly a pound of seven heavy, wide, gigantic BATTERED rings.  Like big edible bangle bracelets.  Not that strange yucky disgusting grainy-textured breaded take-off.  When did THAT unappetizing preparation start appearing in restaurants, anyway?  BAH BAH !  Here at Joe's, indulge yourself in the real, crispy thing, and plan on crunching away for several minutes.  And if you can't finish them, slip them over your wrist for later.    We (and other family members, too) have been coming here for years, and have been very pleased the majority of times.  The only thing we ordered maybe twice, maybe three, but never again, is their corned beef sandwich.  We'd always hope ---because Joe's was nearby---that they'd come close to Goodman's on Pearl (now closed) fabulously incomparable version.  Unfortunately, no.    ? ? ? ? ? ?         If you happen to be a Senior-Basher . . .   What's up with all the snide, ignorant comments  about \"geezers\", \"blue-hairs\", \"geratrics\", and all the  other mean-spirited references to senior citizens?   Normal, healthy-minded people of all ages go to  restaurants for FOOD---not to gawk at, laugh at, then  write about older patrons in some nasty immature  reviews.  Shameful.  You end up saying more about  YOURSELVES  than the ones you make fun of.   Your own contemptible words expose YOU for what you  are.  With disrespect like this, you're unwelcome here---    and just about anywhere.     Some helpful advice:   Ever wonder what others in your age range think of--- or say about---YOU in those \"hipper\" \"younger\" places  you like?   Trust me.  If they're decent and normal---DON'T ASK.                    You don't ever want to know. ."}
{"text":"Healthy portions (as many other reviewers have stated) and friendly servers.  Even though they've built a larger restaurant within the last year, they're already starting to outgrow it.  Parking lot was full and there was a number of people waiting for a table at 5:15 PM on Saturday and a LOT waiting by the time we left a little after 6PM."}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's many times over the years. We went to pick up dessert the other day and I realized that I've never written a review!  We love this place so much that we had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding there! They were so cooperative and helped us to customize our menu. For that dinner we had two choices - a chicken dish and corned beef sandwiches. We also had them provide some appetizers and desserts. Food was so good as usual. Prices were reasonable (much more reasonable than some of the other locations we looked at!)  All the guests loved it.   The food on other occasions has been wonderful. However, you have to go there knowing you will probably wait for a little while if you are at peak times. With the new, bigger location it hasn't been quite as bad. As far as portion sizes go, they are usually quite large, leaving you with lunch for the next day. I say definitely get their corned beef at least once.  Desserts at this place are amazing. On this last trip we got a peanut butter & chocolate cake - so rich and delicious. Looking at the dessert case while you are waiting to be seated really makes you hungry. But like I said, the portions are usually really big, so remember to save room for dessert! So worth it!"}
{"text":"Usually make it Joe's once around the holidays and always end up pleased with whatever I order (especially if that includes a slice of cake!). This time I went with the potato pancake appetizer which with four large pancakes, sour cream and applesauce was plenty large enough to work as a meal.  I definitely don't mind not having to shred potatoes and mess with hot oil to get my potato pancake fix! I tried some of the chicken noodle soup which is made with dark meat and is really tasty.   The place was pretty packed midmorning the day after Christmas but the server kept up with refills and checking in very well. They seemed a bit exasperated at times, but I couldn't blame them. Overall a really enjoyable experience with lots of good food!"}
{"text":"How was this my first time eating at Joe's?? Two of my friends have been talking about Joe's for MONTHS but for whatever reason, it never worked out for me to go with them until the other night. You walk in and there's a dessert case full of huge cakes and cheesecakes and cookies. Joe's is basically a sit-down deli with some mediterranean food ... and chicken parm?? Basically, they have a huge menu and it took me a LONG time to settle on ONE entree. Menu = apps (mozz sticks to hummus to mujadara), salads, soups, sandwiches, hot sandwiches, burgers, hot entrees, etc. They had different daily specials, so be sure to read what they are as you walk in or ask your server for them if you forget to look at them.  We started with the hummus, which was served in a huge bowl, tasted super fresh and came with a steaming hot bag of pita quarters (each almost the size of a regular half pita!!). Loved the hummus, thought the pitas were just alright.... I finally settled on getting the Chicken Philly and got it with the cajun fries. One friend got the Philly cheesesteak with cajun fries and the other got the chicken parmesan with matzo ball soup to start with. We all had the matso ball soup (it was my first time) and it was def tasty (although I'm not too sure how I feel about matso balls in general). We all shared a side order of the onion rings. Basically the table next to us kept inspiring us to get what they had b/c everything just looked so delish!!! My Chicken philly was wonderful! The grilled chicken was perfect and overall it was delish. My friend who got the Philly cheesesteak loved her meal. The one who got the chicken parm has been going there since she was legit a baby and has probably tried everything twice so she decided to try the chicken parm this time, and while she said it was still good, she did mention that Joe's is probably not the place to order chicken parm... The onion rings were HUGE and amazing rings of fried goodness. And, I was OBSESSED with the cajun fries.   There was LEGIT enough food on our table to feed a small army. All of their portions are SUPER huge and can feed you anywhere from 2-4 times in my opinion (could have fed me 3 times if I didn't share my leftovers today).   My friends ordered this pumpkin cookie to go, but of course I had to have a taste before we left. It was SUPER soft despite it being 9pm, huge (of course), and was drizzled with what I assumed to be orangey and vanilla-et icings. yumyumyum  I wanted a cabarnet during dinner and decided to try the Lebanese one on the menu (they have 2 options) and wasn't too impressed, it had a tarty-sorta sweet after taste, which I wasn't a fan of, but that's just personal taste.  As we walked out, I again stared into the dessert cases, mouth watering, but stomach and brain telling me to keep moving. I will definitely be returning to try (ALL OF) the cakes and more items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Yummmm!  (Another long overdue review...I'm slacking!) Joe's is a Lebanese family-owned restaurant serving up amazing American and Lebanese fare.  If you've been to Cleveland's famous Slyman's for their ginormous corned beef and pastrami sammiches, you'll be able to get the same thing here at Joe's in Rocky River! The owners are cousins.   Everything I've had here has been absolutely delicious! From hot corned beef piled high on soft rye, to huge fresh salads, juicy grilled lamb chops, and tasty matzo ball soup! You'll love it all! Portions are on the large side, so come hungry!  Oh, and I can't forget about the amazing desserts!  You'll see the huge display case filled with mouthwatering cakes as you walk into the dining room. Don't forget to save room for cake!  Joe's moved into a brand new building maybe 5 years ago or so, and it's beautiful! Marble floors and nice woodwork throughout the huge restaurant make for a pleasant dining experience.  They have a gorgeous wood bar with a few beers on tap...usually Great Lakes and some other domestics.   This place is always packed, so be prepared to search for a parking spot and wait for a table when you get in.  Joe's seems to cater to a lot of seniors and families.  It's a pretty popular place for breakfast, although I've only been there for dinner.  Employees are very friendly and service is excellent.  Eat at Joe's!"}
{"text":"The best upscale diner around, bar none. Amazing everything, fresh foods, fruits, mile high sandwiches, desserts - you name it they have it, and it's delicious. Try to go off peak hours to lessen any potential wait times."}
