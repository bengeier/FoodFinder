{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed by this place. They have a sampler where it's 25 wings for I believe $18? We chose 5 diff flavors, and they have so many to chose from! Garlic lemon pepper was not our favorite...I'm a fan of honey bbq and ming sweet chili and we always go with medium for a little bit of heat but not too much. The wings are HUGE! If your in the area try em out!"}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint!  The food wings are great. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that stop you. The lemon pepper and grilled teriyaki wings are awesome."}
{"text":"This place was rated number 1 for wings...and it is very true! Lots of delicious flavors. The other food is great here as well, I usually get wings but the burgers and sandwiches are also great. The service is usually pretty good, it really depends on who is working. They have a few tables outside for outdoor seating, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best wings I have ever had. I come to Charlotte 2-3 times a year and my first stop is always wing king.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Probably gets 1-star for ambiance, but the wings are great (and that's the point, right?!). I highly recommend the sampler platter- you get to try 4 or 5 different kinds of wings, and really you cant go wrong with any of their offerings. They have a ton of flavors in all different degrees of hotness (another thing that makes the sampler nice- if you're with someone like me who can't handle the spicy stuff!).  The fries here are also really good and they offer take-out too, so you can call ahead and pick your wings up if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. My boyfriend and I came in for lunch today (like most people, we are allotted 1 hour for lunch out of a 9 hour day). We arrived at around 12:20, were served water, and the waitress disappeared for several minutes until we asked her what time it was at 12:32 because we had left our phones in the car. She was very cold in her response, as she had been when I asked her what her favorite sauce for the wings were, but we had hoped she got the point that the we were in a bit of a hurry after asking her. About 10 minutes after that, we asked her to go ahead and put our food into a to-go box because we were crunched for time. At that time, we saw her walk up to the kitchen to ask for a box, and the kitchen looked very puzzled. We realized that she had forgotten to put in the order!!!! We saw everything unfold and were hoping she would come and tell us what we already knew about her forgetting to put in the order and maybe offer up an apology, but that was NOT the case. We waited about 10 more minutes until it was after 12:50 and went to the kitchen and told her to cancel our order. She was DUMBFOUNDED and instead of offering an apology and telling us that she forgot to put our order in, she said \"but it's almost ready!\". We told her we needed to get back to work because we were going to be LATE and only then did she coldly utter a \"sorry\". I was in a hurry to get back to work, and I called the manager to explain what happened and all he could say was \"sorry, she forgot to put in the order\". NOTHING was offered in return for this horrible experience, not a free lunch, drink, NOTHING. I don't think I would even use it if it was offered, I would NEVER give a place with this low of standards and customer service one penny. I guess that they don't realize that people with full time jobs only have one hour for lunch. After reading the reviews though, it seems like people have had the same experience with horrible customer service and waitresses that would rather be anywhere else but serving you. If you have all afternoon off of work to eat wings and chicken fingers and enjoy being talked to like you are stupid by the waitresses, this is the place for you!!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently closes at 11:15 on a Friday?!? And after a Panther game?? Sorry business. Too bad, great wings and atmosphere. And I couldn't have a drink with the other 11 workers/owners that were there....."}
{"text":"Have lived in this area for 20 years, Wing King has not only survived the growth but maintained its lead as the best in the area. Menu, food, and service are incredible. With all of the new restaurants in the area, this is still our go-to place for all of this time.   I can't recommend any one thing, it is all great - have tried most of the varied and huge menu and everything is great."}
{"text":"When you pick up take out...Check your food..I know....but I was rushing...so I didn't...big mistake! The wings were burnt to charcoal quality crisp..... I drove back and asked therm to remake them...but my kids refused to eat them so we tossed them in the trash..... Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Holy moly. Such an incompetent staff! I mean I'm torn between amazement and gnashing my teeth. Dumb founded by how hard it is to put in a order, receive it, and pay for it."}
{"text":"All I can say is the southern wings with the gravy is absolutely amazing! Never had an issue here and I usually order pick up. My old roommate and her brother introduced me to this place."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for about 3 years now - It's the only place we go for wings.   The employees are friendly, our orders are always repeated back to us and accurate when placing a carry-out.   Try the king sampler platter...they have a bunch of flavors to choose from.   I recommend the XXX and the honey BBQ"}
{"text":"This place has hands-down the best wings out there. Try the rotisserie, medium, garlic parm, and southwestern flavors. Delicious!! Great fried pickles and onion rings too- the sauce is so good!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely off their wings and buffalo chicken sandwich. Some of the best in town. For those that have been to DD Peckers, these sauces are nearly identical. The ambiance may be lacking but the chicken is packing."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in on a Sunday afternoon, for wings and to watch the Panther's game. We got there and there were no empty tables, which we thought was a good sign, and found seats at the bar. The service was OK, not great, not terrible. After a few minutes of sitting at the bar, the man next to my husband started talking to us. My husband is very friendly and started making small talk. He then disappeared for awhile, we assumed he was gone and ate our lunch. About 30 minutes later he came back with a new drink and a shot in his hand (not sure where they came from bc there is only one bar) He then starting talking to me and got a little bit inappropriate, at which point my husband asked for the check. We tried to ignore him while we paid, and the bartender did nothing to help the situation. As we were about to leave, the drunk man asked my husband for a ride home. Really?!? who is this guy? My husband politely told him no and I had already gotten up and walked away towards the door. My husband said he got very upset and started cursing at him as he walked away. The \"manager\" was at the host stand on our way out, and we stopped to tell him that this guy was harassing us, was very intoxicated and needed a cab. He asked us to point him out, and when we did, he laughed, saying, \"oh, he's a regular who always gets that drunk.\" WOW. If they would rather have customers like that, over paying, polite and good tipping customers, they got it! We will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"If you're in  the mood for pretty good dive food, this is the place.  True grub: generous portions and very reasonable prices.  Not flashy.  We took my 19y/o nephew for the one pound hot dog.  He tried but didn't defeat it.  My sister had some black wings she devoured, I thought they looked burnt.  I had the buffalo chick sand, very saucy and a little overcooked, someone else ordered a side of chicken livers and was overwhelmed by the portion.  Service was unimpressive but overall the food would make me return."}
{"text":"The grilled wings seemed to be truly cooked on the grill at one time.  Now it appears the wings are cooked off the grill and quickly given grill marks prior to serving.  Not really tasty either.  The fried green beans and Southwest eggrolls never disappoint, but they start from prebagged frozen so you wouldn't expect any less.  As far as service goes, when I come in, the waitress makes eye contact with me then goes and waits on another customer before seeing to my order even if she was just standing there not busy before I walked in. This has happened several times with different waitresses and is the reason I will never return."}
{"text":"Ignore the look of the place on the outside...it's the food on the inside that counts.  Their wings are amazing, boneless or not, are juicy, crisp and all the various favors will make everyone happy.  Try the sweet and spicy mustard, it was amazing.  The portions were very good, food was hot even for take out.  You can't go wrong if you're looking for wings."}
{"text":"We went here with a small group based off recommendations from multiple friends. The best wings/sauce and fried pickle chips I've had in Charlotte yet! The chicken was excellent, the sauce was full of flavor/spice, and everything we ordered came in great portions! Service was great, our server, Britnee, was very sweet and always checking in on us. We will definitely be returning here in the near future."}
{"text":"Excellent wings and friendly servers. We were surprised because the place needs some work on the outside - that's the only reason I held back on the fifth star.  Well be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying and was very disappointed.   Got the sampler. Wings were not flavorful and very greasy.   Won't be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I visited Charlotte for the 1st time in August 2016, so I wasn't sure what to expect from food to people to activities. However, my husband has been here for CIAA festivities several times, yet he never uncovered this gem until this visit. We were super hungry after finishing up at Carowinds. Amusement Park and there weren't many places open nearby. Hence, we pulled up our handy dandy \"Google\" search engine. We typically read reviews, so thank you to all my fellow Yelpers for helping us discover the best freakin wings we've ever had. We didn't have to wait for seating upon arrival and the waitstaff were very kind and courteous. Everything looked good on the menu, however we were in the mood for some wings. We chose a sampler and batches of 10 as my husband must try everything when we go to a new restaurant. You know a good chicken joint when you don't have to request your chicken well done as I believe that's the only way chicken is fried down South any way. Just thinking about the taste of the flavors we tried have my mouth watering as I write this. The seasoned fries were delicious. I was once on the fence about relocating to the Charlotte-Mecklenberg area, however after these wings I decided...we are moving! I hope to frequent here quite often."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best wing spots in Charlotte. The grilled wings are exceptional! I haven't had a better beer battered onion rings yet.  You have to try it. It's a topic of discussion. This spot is in the top ten of my favorite spots in Charlotte..I kid you not. Don't sleep on the fried oysters either."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm the first one to review this great place for hot wings!  I'm new to the Steele Creek area in Charlotte, so my wife and I have been scoping out places to eat for the past couple of months.  We both love great hot wings and we were eager to try out Wing King Cafe based on the recommendation of a friend.  First off, this place isn't really a place you can take the family out for a sit-down dinner.. its more your typical hole-n-wall local bar.. although they serve things like burgers, salads, etc. ... their claim to fame is their wings.. and boy are they good.  Probably one of the best wing places in Charlotte.  Probably my favorite wing is called the \"Ming Wing\" which is a wing dipped in some sort of honey/sesame sauce.  All the other sauces are great as well so feel free to try them all."}
{"text":"This place is delish. The server we had was awful but the food was great. Hot and fresh wings and amazing house made blue cheese.  Good location and classic divey fitting for a wing and beer spot. Get some better servers and this would be a 5!"}
{"text":"This place may look like a corner bar but hidden in the kitchen is a five star cook.  The fish sandwich is the best around, and they are indeed King of The Wings.  My favorite go to spot in Charlotte."}
{"text":"These wings are fantastic! The boneless wing meat is white and not at all fatty. The fried breaking is slightly crunchy and the sauces are so good! Tons of choices and super yummy!"}
{"text":"My family and I used to love this place but we have been pretty disappointed with it lately.  The last two times we have gone there the wings have been bad.  Several of the wing bones were broken and were hard to eat without getting pieces of bone in your mouth and they were also soaked in grease.  I obviously expect grease but that was all I could taste.  One time we got a completely wrong order and forgotten items.  We gave them another chance but it was still the same outcome.  Too bad :( We really enjoyed this place when it was good."}
{"text":"Yay, I'm a fan! I love it. Great food, great service, great date night, great hang out spot with friends, great chill spot over all, good location, kinda hard to find but once you do you'll never get lost.  Overall a great experience but  can't quite give it a five for my rating scale. But love it.  The best wings! Haven't had anything else.  Prices are good too."}
{"text":"I wish I could separate the food as a 4 and the staff as a 2. We go to WKC intermittently as the wings are really good and love the flavors. Outside of wings and the yummy pickle chips, I haven't really tried much of anything else. They do have good domestic beer specials as well.   We have decided to just do take out as it seems challenging to get the attention of some of the wait staff. A couple of them are good, but the majority are absent or preoccupied chatting away with others. Once I finally get to order and awaiting my food, my beer goes empty even when the place only has a handful of customers.   If the staff knows you, then you are in luck as they will be fully attentive and spend tons of time at your table socializing while neglecting all the tables around you.   In summary, I recommend the wings, any flavor- but TO GO."}
{"text":"Between dine in and take out I've eaten here about a dozen times now since it's near my home.  Wings are good. I find it does vary from visit to visit though; sometimes the flavors I always order vary a bit in terms of heat and taste, sometimes wings are good, sometimes dry.  I like their raw fries, but they don't have a way to pack them that allows them to be very edible for take-out, so eat them in the restaurant if you want them.  The service is hit or miss also; I'd say 75% of the time I dine in it's good.  It's a very loud place when it's busy so probably not a great option if you want to sit and chat quietly, but that's to be expected from this type of place.  Lots of TVs in and out of the bar.  Good # of out-door tables."}
{"text":"Wings were awesome.  Wait was not.  I tried to call in an order for a half hour or so and the line was busy (because they took it off the hook).  So I decided to head to the Wing King to see what all the hype was about.  Once I arrived I learned they were not taking carry out orders anymore either!  They had (80) to-go tickets when I arrived at 6:00pm.  So I sat and ordered some wings...40 mins later I got'em!  They forewarned me.  To be fair it was a few hours before the Panthers playoff game but still u think they would be prepared for that?  The atmosphere is a ok...typical local bar.  Lots of tv's.  Also found out that super bowl wings orders should be placed 2-weeks before and the actual restaurant is not open that day other than carry out.  These are the best wings I have had in Charlotte.  Crispy, saucy, and delicious.  The only thing they could better is the Beer selection.  It sucks.  Steer clear of BW's and Wild Wings and head to this local restaurant for great wings."}
{"text":"I loved this place food is good. chicken. Wing delicious whit variety of the flavor we try all  .also good price en beer"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, so good!! A perfect place to stop by on the way home. Wings and seafood are delicious."}
{"text":"An interesting place. 16 seat bar area. The tables are crowded closely. Bathrooms are better than the tree out front. Now the food is good. Fresh, hot, and covered in sauces. The menu is complicated. It reads like a DMV test. You can only order some types of chicken with some sauces. If you want it your way go to BK."}
{"text":"Ordered grilled chicken sandwich with the teriyaki sauce and it was horrible. The breast was over cooked and chewy. I think they forgot my sauce...at least I hope they did because it was bland as hell and the kaiser roll was cold and stale. The fried mushrooms and southwest egg rolls were awesome and hubby's wings were good so I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Great wings..daily beer specials... this place has become my new hang out..."}
{"text":"Accidentally posted this review on the wrong restaurant.  Someone named \"Mike M\" was nice enough to send me an expletive laden message to let me know I mixed up Wang King and Wing King.    Regardless, I corrected my rating to reflect Wing King.  Best wings in Charlotte are definitely TLC Wings just off 485 on 51."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for about 5 years now. & the customer service has went down. The food isn't as good as it used to be either.   Oh and if you call in to get a to go order you get charged $.50   You also get charged for extra ranch."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, decent crowd. Ordered the 10 wing basket with fries. This review is very subjective considering I prefer my wings breaded and naked. I love that fried taste dipped in ranch. So I was looking for something very specific.   Overall, decent tasting wings and fries with very good dipping sauces (also didn't charge me extra which was nice). I enjoyed myself but nothing blew me away. Great beer prices daily at $1.75 a beer everyday.   If you haven't had DD Peckers as your wing destination then you're REALLY missing out. They take the cake but overall, Wing King has decent wings that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Tried this place during lunch and the wings did not disappoint.  Just the right amount of sauce.  Service was quick, and the waitress did a good job.  Dining area is a little tight and could use some bigger TVs, but this place can stand alone on their wings.  Kind of a strange patio dining area out front."}
{"text":"The garlic Parmesan wings are nothing less than awesome ....we have ordered take out here 3 times now and has been the same every time there good crispy wings the way they should be"}
{"text":"I bought wings and nachos for the national championship game. LITERALLY WORST FOOD EVER. I ordered hot and teriyaki wings and i could not tell the difference in flavor. They were bland and burnt. The nachos are beef (unseasoned apparently) cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. No guac , no beans, onions, salsa. How you ruin nachos is beyond me. Maybe the other food on the menu is better but this was the worst food I ever spent money on."}
{"text":"Place is a complete dump, but the food is very good and the beer prices are very, very good.  Still one of the rare places you can go in on a Saturday at 4pm with 30 bucks, leave at 8pm-- full, drunk and with a couple of decent looking women's phone numbers in your pocket."}
{"text":"This is our \"go-to\" place to eat. We end up craving it every week! We usually get take out, so we don't normally eat at the restaurant, but we have never had an issue with our take-out orders. We love it so much! The servers are always so nice and we always have very quick service. I would recommend this to everyone who stops through Fort Mill, SC. Kudos, Wing King Cafe - we love y'all so much!"}
{"text":"Pretty good wings! In search for a new wing restaurant, we decided to try Wing King Cafe. The ambiance was casual and the staff were friendly and ready to answer any questions. We tried the wings (hot & garlic Parmesan), boneless wings (hot), chicken tenders, and French fries. The wings were a big hit because of the size, flavor, and crispness. The hot were our favorite over the garlic Parmesan. The boneless were just as good as the wings, flavorful, huge, and crispy. The tenders were hand breaded and fresh out of the fryer, very good. The French fries were not as much as a hit but I really liked the seasoning. The only thing for us was that the chicken wings came with no celery and the ranch was not as good as our usual wing restaurant. Other than that, my family really enjoyed Wing King Cafe and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of great wings, and this place serves some of my favorites. Server was attentive on a busy night. My order of Hot BBQ wings was well cooked, and the crinkle fries were tasty. There's a small dining room around the bar,  a few flat screens to catch a game as well. Would recommend to anyone wanting a good order of wings. Haven't been adventurous enough yet to try other items on a diverse menu."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for wings, so on a recent business trip to Charlotte I looked on Yelp to find a good spot.  This is a simple place... kinda of a dive.  It's in a strip mall, and packed with regulars.  Everyone that walked in was greeted by name.  The owner was hanging out at the end of the bar drinking beers, and chatted it up with everyone.  I felt right at home (which is the Pilot Inn of course).  Their onion rings were awesome.  They were homemade, very crunchy with a flaky spicy batter.  The rings were served with a horseradish sauce to kick em up a notch.  The wings were very solid.  A little on the small side, but they made up for it with a great selection of flavors.  I had 5 XXX Honey, and 5 Hot Garlic Parmesan... both sauces were my favorites anywhere.  The XXX Honey wasn't overly spicy, and had a sweet honey taste to ease the spice.  The Hot Garlic Parmesan were also very good.  The chunks of garlic and Parmesan formed a great crust."}
{"text":"No thanks. This is a deep fry food place 100%, not at all original. Kind of shady. Has the feel of a \"we go there cause this is our place even if it is bad this is ours\" attitude from the patrons. If opening a business took only having a deep fryer and a ratty building I am not sure why there is not 100 of these places in a 5 mile radius. I don't get it but that is just me. Prices are inline with much more established places who actually update the interior and have a more elaborate environment. Lastly when you leave you might as well toss whatever you wore in the  wash immediately as you cannot get that stank out of you nose quick enough."}
{"text":"The worst French dip in my life! The broth tasted like greasy pan drippings. Couldn't eat it, and that's saying a lot for me. I have never felt strongly enough to make a negative review before."}
{"text":"Good food to go, not so great ambiance she dining in, although I really like the one bartender. I would much rather support this business than a corporate chain like BW3s"}
{"text":"My brother said that this place was amazing so I tried it. I'm a bit of a good snob and have been blessed in my life to enjoy some pretty exceptional culinary experiences...this was not one. I think I would honestly rate them a 3.5 stars if I could give them a half of star...the food was okay, hot, interesting flavors but none of them wow'd me. The bartender who helped me was very nice and she was very accommodating. I guess I would return but not in love. Yelp ratings state that Three Stars = AOk I guess I can agree with that.  Enjoy!  Signed with Love and Calories,  The Original Charlestonian"}
{"text":"This location used to be a favorite lunch spot with my coworkers. For some reason,  the service has gone downhill. The staff was not courteous and seemed to laugh off our requests. The whole lunch took over an hour and a half, and one in our party of 7 never got their order. I received no refills and only part of my order arrived when it finally came. Being a wing place, I didn't get a basket for my bones or wet naps afterward. When the check came, rather than figuring out who ordered what, she handed it to the person in the middle asking for \"help\". The staff was insincere, and seemed rush, even though we dined on a Tuesday, and arrived before noon."}
{"text":"Seat yourself small bar, with $2.00 everyday bud light draft.  Cook to order wings, with lots of choices. Maui wowie wings were amazing with blue cheese dressing is actually fresh cold and tasty.  Cheese balls appetizer is a huge portion with marinara sauce, slight spice to the cheese, perfect with the cold beer.   Parking is tight and in a tiny long standing mini plaza, drove past hundreds of times.  It is definitely worth a visit.   Good bar food, good service and good time!"}
{"text":"Though we came on a busy night,  the wait staff was with it.  Teamwork out the wazoo. You can feel the friendly atmosphere,  and we were constantly checked on (in a good way) by all the members of their team. The food was delicious and served in a timely manner.  Ranch was the bomb.com Reasonably priced,  normal for the type of food and restaurant.  Will come again when we're in town again!"}
{"text":"There wing are Awesome ! I love the honey hot! My hubby love the extra Krispy hot! The fries are crispy and hot. I dip the fries in the ranch dressing!!! Yummy"}
{"text":"OK...OK I had to give them a try! From the awesome reviews everyone gave and since I was already out that way I stopped in...as expected the outside did not impress me and I was worried that my Yelpers got it wrong...but I'm so glad that my Yelpers got it right These wings are awesome!!!   I tried a 10 piece as a combo with fries and slaw. I tried the Hot BBQ and the Hot Garlic Parmesan. I knew after the first bite that this was going to be one of my new favorite wing places. The sauces were absolutely fantastic, full of robust flavor and a nice spicy kick! The chicken was juicy and tender...they came out hot and fresh from the kitchen...now I did have to wait a while for my order to come out...but it was totally worth the wait.   I cant wait to go back and try something else! I guess my mom was right, you really cant judge a book by the cover!"}
{"text":"This place rewrites the definition of \"don't judge a book by its cover.\"  On the outside Wing King Cafe looks like a run-down joint next to a gas station, (I reference the gas station because my friend had told me to make a right after the gas station and I missed it, after which he tried to say that he meant \"at the gas station\" and we ended up making two u-turns just to get back to it.) and on the inside the place looks like little more than a clean-ish dive bar with a section to play corn hole and a little darts.  Even the service here resembles that of a run-of-the-mill/hole-in-the-wall bars no where near prepared for the service it gets here; the waitress brought me regular wings when I asked for boneless, but I digress.  The food here more than makes up for any other glaring issues this \"Cafe\" might present. The wings here actually have meat; for the first time in my life, I bit into wings and tasted MEAT and not some sort of flour. Not taking away from their perfectly crispy batter of course, which complements the meat in ways I can't describe other than the way Homer Simpson drools about food.  The \"24K Gold\" and \"Honey XXX\" were the two I tried. Both were distinctively delicious but not quite memorable as I was too hungry to think about complex flavors. I will have to go back for more detailed notes in the future.  I also did not expect my side order of fried mushrooms to come in an entire tray (there was probably enough fried mushrooms to feed a family of three in my order) and despite being clumsy with my order, the waitress was extremely attentive thereafter and I couldn't really blame her for getting my order wrong when she was also waiting on six other tables at the same time.  An additional \"thank you\" to the gentleman/lady who picked up mine and my friend's tab for being in uniform; I find it absolutely embarrassing when people \"appreciate\" me for doing a job that I signed up for, but I thank you for not eye-balling me and muttering profanities under your breath like some people do in my home state."}
{"text":"Good crispy wings, many flavors and varieties, but the atmosphere kind of throws you off. Kind of lacking identity I guess? In any case, not sure what else to say other than the wings had great flavor. LOL!"}
{"text":"We hopped off 77 to fuel up and I looked on Yelp to see if there was any good food nearby.  After reading the reviews for Wing King Cafe, we had to stop in and try it.   Yes, it is in a strip mall and yes, the decor is a little football-bar-esque, but it's a wing place so I didn't really expect anything different.   The prices are pretty decent for a wing place; we ordered the pick two appetizer with the raw fries and fried mushrooms. The raw fries were pretty tasty handmade potato chips, and the fried mushrooms were much better than I've had at other other places.  We also ordered 30 wings: 10 bone-in hot wings, 10 boneless Cajun dry rub and 10 honey BBQ sauced.  Mine were the latter, and they were fantastic, although with the appetizer I could only eat half of them.  My other party members said that their wings were great, as well.  With both the appetizer and the wings, they give a generous portion of ranch / blue cheese which was good enough to be homemade.   I would definitely stop in here again next time we are passing through, thanks to all of my fellow Yelpers for the great find."}
{"text":"Easily the best wings in Charlotte. We've come here two nights in a row now and haven't had any problems. Well, tonight my BLT came on Texas toast instead of a bun like I requested but to be honest it doesn't even matter. The food is awesome, the prices are right, and the atmosphere is great. Location is a bit odd but don't let that throw you off. Definitely go, get the wings with the honey gold sauce, have a $1.75 beer and relax."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has visited here regularly. He just now shared this gem with me. They have the best wings!! They are perfectly crispy and sauced. You are missing out if you haven't eaten here!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good! I got ten wings with the hot sauce, fries and fried pickles. Everything was cooked well. The hot wings had just the right amount of kick. Their blue cheese is the perfect complement to any wing. It's very chunky, so if you like that then you will enjoy it. I only gave it four stars because they could use some improvement in their customer service. If my husband hadn't been here before, we might not have known to seat ourselves. Some of the waitstaff walked by but no one addressed us. Once we got to our table we waited about 5 min before we were acknowledged. All I was looking for was a \"Hi, I will be with you in a minute\" Our waitress was nice and topped off our drinks without us having to ask. Over all it's a nice place."}
{"text":"I am not a wing person though I have eaten them at the Ft Mill location and they are good.  But I really like the one pound hotdog.  (Shush)  I convinced my wing loving coworker to go get lunch there.  I was surprised by the fact that they add fifty cents to a To Go order.  Um, why?  And then there was a sign saying that if you order to go, you HAVE TO LEAVE to eat.  Um, why?  I also read in the reviews how they charge extra for celery.  Um, why?  Too many rules and fees for me.  I don't want to feel like I need an accountant and a lawyer when I eat out."}
{"text":"Apparently I caught them on an off day. First timer and guess I  should have asked if flavor was grilled versus fried. Good customer service would state they are grilled and ask me if to proceed with the order. Anyway, the Honey Hot Teriyaki  were rushed and tough, only ate half of them,plus was sick as a dog later . As another  reviews points to strange grill marks. I see all the great reviews,so maybe I need to try fried varieties. Food that makes you go Hmmmm?"}
{"text":"The wings were so good! Crispy on outside and juicy on inside. We got the sampler which comes with 25 wings and 5 different sauces to try. Way to go and a perfect amount to split between 2-3 people."}
{"text":"Great Wings and damn good people. I always go with either Honey Gold or Sweet Chili, never a bad choice."}
{"text":"FREAKING IN LOVE.  25 wings/five flavors for $18.95?  Yes, please!  Honey gold = amazing.  Please don't come here expecting a gourmet, fancy experience.  It is what it should be: a dive-y bar in a strip mall that serves up delicious wings and sides for more than reasonable prices.  I got a pick-two combo of onion rings and fried pickles for $7.95 that went great with the wings.   I've been hunting all over Charlotte for the best eats to take friends when they come visit us in town and this will definitely be on our list of places to take them for cheap, yummy food that's quick and convenient."}
{"text":"Yes, I have to admit, the looks of the place outside & in, I was a bit skeptical of what the food tastes like. Boy was I wrong!  Settled in a small strip mall, which also houses a gas station, Wing King looks much like a sketchy sports bar.   It's pretty spacious inside, has a full bar, TV & a room especially for cornhole.  This trip had us take our wings (garlic parmesan & 24 Karat) & onion rings to go. Unfortunately the onion rings didn't fair too well on the 20 minute trip home; the wings did. The onion rings are thin & range from wide circles to small ones. The batter has a bit of spicy kick to them & the accompanied sauce really kick them up a notch! The wings were cooked perfectly, had the right amount of sauce to them & the parmesan ones had just enough parmesan on them. The 24 Karat was sweet & spicy & not overpowering.  Oddly though, you can have your pick of ranch or blue cheese, but celery is extra. Hmmm? Yeah.   Overall I'm pleased with Wing King. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"After hearing all of the Wing King hoopla and praise, it was destiny to stumble upon this fantastic joint at some point. We had played a round of disc golf down at Winthrop and were on our way back up I-77 and then *CLICK*. We were close to Wing King. The timing was perfect, the hunger was imminent, and wings were on the menu.   On our way, we read a few other reviews and were a little iffy about dining in or taking out. We decided the full experience was necessary. We seated ourselves and grabbed our own menu and began to peruse the mountain of sauces available. Everything from teriyaki to crazy dry rubs. We settled on a large basket of fries with a side of medium sauce for my wife and 10 wings (5 Medium and 5 Honey Hot) for me.   The fries are great. Krinkle cut with a subtle dusting of seasoning salt. The medium sauce....Textbook. It really does stick the the doctrine of \"medium\" and doesn't provide too much spiciness. Pungent flavor and well rounded with a buttery finish.   The wings are evenly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and a good mix of flats and drums. I'm a big fan of the mixture as I feel flats tend to have more flavor and are more tender. The sauces work wonders on chicken. Goodness gracious. The medium will make any dyed in the wool wing-lover weak at the knees. The honey hot is something out of a romance novel. A sweet, succulent sauce that is thick like honey and has a slight twinge of heat. We even started dipping our fries in it! Usually 10 wings is too much for me, but I muscled through these bad boys with ease.   I would have to say that Wing King lives up to the infamy. Wings that can turn my head and stay in my flavor memory are rare. I look forward to many visits to come!"}
{"text":"Really great chicken wings, amazing price!!   I love the grilled wings and the homemade ranch dressing. While I haven't ever dined in, I love their quick takeout service.   Better than wild wing cafe and buffalo wild wings on this side of town."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte!  I'm originally from Upstate NY so my family often comes to visit and the FIRST stop on my Dad's list is Wing King to get his favorite Honey Hot wings!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in a long time. This is definitely a place Most tourists won't find but it's worth it. There isn't much ambiance or atmosphere but you don't need it when the food is just GOOD. They had a nice amount of options but the wings of course are the star. There are at least 20 different flavors of sauces to choose from. They are clearly labeled so you know which ones are hot or not. They bring you out containers for your bones and wet naps and plenty of blue cheese/ranch and celery. The cook on the wings are perfect and we didn't try a sauce we didn't like! The prices are great and they run different specials on beers. All in all, best wing spot I've visited while out of town.  Very nice to get away from the chains."}
{"text":"Great wings, awesome service, excellent experience overall.  I'm originally from the Midwest so I'm an avid Buffalo Wild Wings fan.  I promise that the wings here would rival and in my opinion beat BW3's. B-Dubs quality has fallen off over the years as the franchise expanded and Wing King was a refreshing experience that reminded me of how B-Dubs was 20 years ago.  The meatiness of the wing, the attention to detail in frying, and the sauces were top notch.  If you like wings and live if Fort Mill or the surrounding area, you will not be disappointed. Dana was our server and she took great care of us, I'd ask for her by name."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved here, and live down the road from Wing King Cafe. We were hungry and wanted something easy so after looking on yelp and saving this place as somewhere to try we decided to go for some wings. The wings are VERY good. I go the hot ranch and my boyfriend got the hot and tangy honey mustard. We both thought our orders were very tasty and will be going there again. We called and ordered for carry out since we just live down the road. The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because 1 the cook their food in the same oil as fish, and if you have allergies that can be scary (which my boyfriend does have a mild allergy with shellfish) and 2 the staff wasn't exactly the most friendly. But I wasn't expecting to handed my food on a golden platter since its definitely a dive bar, but with good food. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about on the food.  This is a regular pub by the gas station.  The food quality was ok and everything was just ok.  Seating was also no fuss."}
{"text":"Delicious wings, and so many sauce options!!!   If you're a wing person, this is worth your time. Decor is pretty gnarly and it definitely looks like a hole in the wall, but the food doesn't disappoint. Might be the best wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Fried pickles were okay but portion was small.    Seriously?   Pickles cost next to nothing.   That didn't bode well for the rest of the meal.  Wings came out fast, but most of them were dry and over cooked.   one flavor were cold to the touch on the ends which was strange perhaps suggesting they were frozen before being fried.  They served only drums which was a positive.   The French fries were standard frozen fair.   Why not serve fresh cut you could be proud of?  The blue cheese dressing was homemade and excellent.  Top to bottom it seems like this establishment is skimping on the quality of its food to make ends meet which is a bad business choice."}
{"text":"I am normally a frequent fan of this establishment. But when I call to place an order and you put the phone down, take at least five orders, chat it up with a few people, cash a few people out and finally pick up the phone as if I'm an inconvenience to you...there's a problem. Get some manners and learn how to serve all of your customers."}
{"text":"Another screwed up take out order.  I'm done trying.  Shame - food is good."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Crappy service. Wait, let's edit that to NO service. Tonight was the fourth and final strike. Each time I've visited this crap hole I've had the worst service and below par food. I tried once again tonight, hoping that after 3 years of avoiding the place perhaps something had changed. Nope. We were never approached or acknowledge after nearly ten minutes it's and left. Chicken Shak is so worth the drive."}
{"text":"Wings are OK but service is really bad. Easy to observe poor systems and poor management. They never answer the phone. I've called them at least ten times and every time either got a busy signal or it just rang and rang with no answer. Had slow service on my first visit a couple weeks ago and figured I'd give them another try (everyone has a bad day). Today I placed a to-go order at the restaurant and was told it would be 25 minutes. Forty-five minutes later I was told they ran out of wings (???) and it would be at least 15 more minutes. Got a refund and won't be back."}
{"text":"All I can say \"Amazing wings!!!\" My go to wing spot in Charlotte! Delicious wings for a great price! Lots of different flavors but my favorite are the honey bbq!!!"}
{"text":"Not much to look at from outside and I never go at night, but that chicken is some of the best in Charlotte area! Great prices too... Not the place to eat so definitely get it to go, but it's worth the stop for some great tasting chicken."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Wing King Café since I was a little kid...they never disappoint! I now live on the other side of town and it is always worth it to take the drive down to enjoy some wings. I love wings and these are the best Charlotte has to offer.    Growing up I always had the same thing. Their fried buffalo chicken sandwich. The most important thing is that this perfectly breaded piece of chicken is huge! The second most important thing is the perfect level of spice. I always get it the spiciest because that's my thing, and you can see the jalepenos and everything in the sauce. They have classic thick cut fries which are perfect to dip in their chunky blue cheese dressing.  Now as I got older I ventured off the menu. My new favorite thing is their grilled wings. Not everywhere has grilled wings, especially grilled that still taste just as good as the fried. I like mine and the hot garlic parmesan! They always have good drink specials with friendly service.   This is not a big or fancy place. Definitely a local spot with enough TV's to enjoy the game on Sunday. Venture away from those chain wing restaurant and try some seriously good chicken!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. However the service was terrible. She never came around to refill our drinks and I had to go refill it myself. Wouldn't recommend it"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the other Wing King locations, we decided to try this location for dinner. The restaurant was new enough that it still looked clean. The server took our order and it went downhill from there. The food for two of the four people at our table arrived. The server wrote down smokin BBQ instead of hot for one order so she sent it back to the kitchen to get it fixed. She came back after she delivered the last set of wings and asked if my nachos ever came out. I obviously did not wolf them down. She apologized and said she would check. She came back and said she took them off the check and I assumed they were being cooked. The manager came over a few minutes  later to apologize and said he took them off the check and was sorry they never came out. He asked if I still wanted something. I told him I was still hungry and had not eaten anything since I ordered so he said he would get me some at no charge. Duh, what's the use of taking them off my ticket if you are never going to give my any food!  They finally came out after everyone else was about done eating.   Overall, the wings were good as they usually are but the service was not great. I probably will go back to the Wing King but not this location."}
{"text":"My girlfriend come here twice a month. If we didn't live so far we'd come everyday. XXX Garlic are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"These 5 stars are for the food and not for the service.  Wings are top notch and my favorite flavors are 24 karat and sweet chilli.  For the service, this place can get busy and the servers don't keep up.  It has kind of a dive bar feel and if your looking for great wings, this is your place. If you are in a hurry, you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place great chicken quesadillas and great customer service, each time I come they great you the wait is never to long and of you order and come and pick it up your food will still be hot! Best place for after church lunch"}
{"text":"I always had food from this place to go but finally went there to check out. Casual place, many options of wings flavors with bones or boneless.  The place wasn't crowded at all and we got there around 1pm.  We ordered fried pickles and fried mushrooms to start and they were good.  I had garlic Parmesan wings with ranch as dressing, my fried had honey barbecue boneless wings and my husband had a spicy barbecue chicken sandwich.  Everything was good and I really enjoy the way their wings tasted it was really flavorful. The only down side was the service which needs to be improved ASAP. Our food took too long to get done even tho the place was basically empty, also our server was not very attentive. Overall, food is good and price is fair but I will probably keep ordering it to go."}
{"text":"Ok this is a confusing review for me to write. I LOVE the cajun chicken tenders at the Wing King. LOVE THEM, no really I LOVE THEM. I also really enjoy the Ming Wings, very unusual and I'm pretty sure you can't get them anywhere else.  BUT...in the 20 or so times I've been there I can honestly say I've ALWAYS experienced terrible service. Sometimes worse than others, but this is why I now consider Wing King a take-out ONLY place. Waitresses are distance and frequently down-right rude. They are neglectful and act pissy if you ask them for anything. Wing King would probably be way more successful with an entirely new wait staff."}
{"text":"Best Wings..possibly even in the east coast :)   We're from northern va, one of the mecca for food lovers and I am jealous of Charlotte's chicken wing gem.   We ordered:  - Fried pickles and green beans: These were OK. they're fried and they come w/ ranch... can't really go wrong.  - The Wings, we ordered a sampler of flavors:   Salt and Vinegar, Southern Style w/ gravy, Garlic Parm, Honey Hot, Smoking Hot.   My favorite was Salt and Vinger + honey hot. I'm not sure how to describe the wings when they cook but they all TASTE like their flavor. This is rare.  The chef is amazing.   The Garlic Parm had small pieces of garlic and you could actually taste it. My husband stated he loved them all.   Can you guys make a location in Northern VA?  :)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday during the lunch hour. It was busy, most seats filled. I ordered to go from the bar (just wings). Service was prompt and food came out quickly. They have a pretty expansive menu so I will be back and look forward to trying more things. Price are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The wings are absolutely amazing and so are the fried pickles and mushrooms! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wings are great, it's a little grungy, but the perfect place for Friday lunch. Try the honey hot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered a to go order at 11:08, why am I just now getting my food at 11:40? All I ordered was a turkey burger and fries. Do better!"}
{"text":"I love wing king. Their garlic lemmon pepper parmesan is my absolute fave and their fried green beans, yummmm. I drive 15 mins for this place!"}
{"text":"rated a zero or negative!!!! their service sucks! (already wrote that in an earlier post) and tonight I got food poisoning from them! never going her again if my life depended on it! DO NOT go here!!!!!!!!!!  --past review (sept 2015)-- Glad I checked my order before heading home after waiting over 20mins for my wings. it was not my order.. so I went back in and she said ok I'll get that back to them and they will be out shortly. 15+mins go by (meanwhile a ton of other people are getting their orders including ones that walked in and ordered.) she looked over to me and said they should be coming soon. now it's going on 30mins. so she goes back to see why my order is not done. they never got my reorder... figures! so I say well can I talk to you manager to get my money back? because this is ridiculous!! the manager comes over (rude) and says we don't do cash back. so they give me a gift card!  next visit I go to use this said gift card and low and behold there's nothing on it.... so I once again complain and say that there is $15 on it and told them the whole story from the last visit. so they honored that finally after telling a different manager about this.  I had some credit of $1.75 left the next visit and ofcourse there is no balance on it. the girls who were working would not believe me! as I took my order I told them my last 2 visits and said I will never return here ever again! and she look stunned! well you have a shitty place and shitty people who work there!"}
{"text":"Their wings are awesome.  They have alot if flavors and you can get them fried or grilled.  Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"If I need wings, I head to Wing King.  I live a block from a Wild Wing and I STILL drive miles to go to Wing King.  It's a little gritty on the inside, but that only guarantees great fried meat.  The service is friendly and fast, but the parking can be a pain since you're fighting a dozen other shops in this gas station/strip mall.  My favorite wing flavor is the salt and pepper.  Huge chunks of ground black pepper and tasty salt crystals flavor the wings perfectly.  Their house salad is huge.  It is a great item to split.  Top everything off with some of the best ranch dressing around.  I have never been disappointed in the King."}
{"text":"This little gem got some banging ass wings, sucks that they close early but man their food is fantastic and it's a nice little spot to grab a drink and watch the game. Be as it may u might have to stand to defend for favorite team, it's the sports fan way."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yesss!!! Being new to Charlotte I have learned to explore what was available. I had a coworker tell me that they had decent wings and one day I decided to find out, since then I haven't gone anywhereeeee else for wings!!!  Now I haven't tried all the flavors but honey hot is something nice and even plain salt and pepper (ask for extra crispy), drool, it wins!! They have thick fries and not the weak shoe strings. The wings aren't the oversized ones that cause you to think about its conception or origins while eating, yet they aren't tiny to make you feel cheated. I have probably picked up over 10 orders and have never had to wait more than 20 minutes. If you have ever been to Picasso's sport bar, yeaaa they so beat them on wings!"}
{"text":"These are the best wings in town.   My favorite are the honey-hot.  Don't forget the fried pickles (chips, not spears) and onion rings.  The batter is crunchy and has a nice kick to it.  They even have some of the best blue cheese dressing around for your wings - thick with lots of chunks of cheese."}
{"text":"This place is a little (a lot) divey but they have a huge selection of wings. I liked the fried teriyaki and the mild buffalo but the lemon pepper wings had very little flavor.  Kids loved the house made chips and burgers. Grilled shrimp was not very good but the cheese steak was awesome.  Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Very disappointed this time.   Every person in kitchen was eating with their gloves on.  We had to beg for drink refills and the wings were not their usual best.  Probably won't be back for a long time."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this evening and I have absolutely nothing but positive feedback. The whole experience was excellent.  - The service was great.  - We could not stop eating the fried mushrooms. - The Hot Wings were just that, hot. Not blistering, not slightly spicy. Hot. - The Hot Wings with Garlic were hot and and had PLENTY of garlic.  - The fries were perfectly cooked and tasted great. - The bill was pretty reasonable.  - The restroom was very clean and smelled fresh.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After going there over the last 10 years my opinion has changed. My son love the 24K sauce. Nothing wrong there. But if you venture to the rest of the menu it get dicey. They seem to cut corners on the sandwiches. The Roast Beef and au jus sauce is terrible. Packaged meat with a beef sauce that taste like it was made with water from the dead sea. Salty AF.  The Philly Cheese Steak sam'ich was missing the steak. It's like they have no idea how any of these things are prepared. I keep asking the wait staff for suggestions and they are terrible suggestions. I know they make tons of money and still the place is dirty and feels dirty. My son hates to eat in the restaurant because it's so dirty and the clients they allow at the bar are far from decent humans. They are rude and obnoxious. Many of them too drunk to make it to the front door and yet them let them drive off. Over all it's not bad but not great. I am hoping for a better wing place in our area we could use it."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here for over 10 years (mostly taking out) and the wings are good. But the reason for writing this review is because I hate to experience horrible wait staff in a great place to eat. Our waitress was very very rude to me and my family and would not allow us to be seated in her area because our party was two adults and three children. I'm assuming more adults or bigger party equals larger tip, and I totally understand that but please don't allow your selfishness to out rule your ability to be a great waiter or waitress. Management was nice and other wait staff was nice but no establishment should allow one bad apple to spoil the whole bunch. Needless to say we did not dine there that evening but for all the readers out there it's probably best to take out than to sit in."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the whole state to get wings!  Great place to have a few drinks and watch a game too!  If you don't try the fried pickles you are missing out as those are the best in the entire world!!"}
{"text":"Good wings... Better than most bars but nowhere near as good as DD Peckers and you would expect better from a place named Wing King... Nice variety  Service is TERRIBLE... Slow, inattentive and no effort at all for courtesy or personality... Sleepwalking would be an upgrade"}
{"text":"Wings are awesome, customer service absolutely sucks. My experience was during take out, so I can imagine how worst it can get if I dined in. I went there the first time and experienced the same thing but bc the wings are BOMBDOTCOM (I ordered garlic parmesan), I came back def won't be a third time. I love to support local business but bc of my experience I'll just go to Wild Wings off Arsley. Wings will be decent but at least I'll get treated with some decency."}
{"text":"Well, well, well......this connoisseur of wings was very impressed by this joint.   I literally stay up at night trying to decide who has the best wings.  Google Charlotte best wings and you get a bunch of places in a bunch of different orders.   Typically, Wing King Cafe, Labowski's and Moosehead are up there.  They all have two things in common ---- great beer and a total dive bar.  A combination, when adding a local craft beer is a taste bud explosion.    It's a wing joint, so many decisions.  Stressful for this wing luva.  Luckily, the wing sampler plate is available.   I think round $25.  This is five flavors and three sauces, it's big enough for two.  I went with Hot Garlic Parm, Honey Hot Teriyaki, Old Bay, Honey Gold and Honey Hot BBQ.  Remember to ask if the wings are grilled or fried.    All were equally outstanding.   The grilled wings, which I am not really a fan of, were excellent.  The meat falls off the bone.  Also, I ordered extra crispy, the meat had a nice snap of the bone ---- typically that means the wings are not frozen.   The home made blue cheeses is outstanding.  I posted a pic, check out my feast.     My wife had the fish sandwich.   She said it was excellent.  The fries were okay.  Just fries, nothing special.   I got to give them props on the half order size of fried mushrooms and fried green beans, half? Really?   That half size platter is big as crap.   You know the stuff is good when the manager carries it out and says \"here is the good stuff\".  Home made horsey sauce.  Yum yum and hellz yasssss please, can I have more!!!!!  My only bitch, NOT ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR LOCAL CRAFT BEERS.  But, in hindsight, the clientele might not support anything other than the normal Bud, Corona and Yeungling beers.   To quote the famous General MacArthur \"I will return\"."}
{"text":"Really good food, and very cold beer. That's all I need. Keep doing what you are doing."}
{"text":"Grat wings. However, just had an odd experience. Ordered dinner from the website. When to pick it up and the girl behind the bar goes \"we were out of the sauce you ordered\".. ok ok no big deal i can just order a new sauce or not get the wings and get the rest of the food for my family. But then she says \"yea we were out of the sauce so we cancelled the whole order.\" Look of confusion comes over my face then her face as i ask \" so you were out of the sauce so you just cancelled to whole order no call, email nothing?\" \"Yup\".  \"Oh ok well have a good night?\" I say as i leave no food in hand and her still confused look. Will definetly order again cause their wings are great. Ill just make sure to phone in my order from now on."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years and nothing has changed one bit. And that's a very good thing. Let's just get to what's most important. The wings. They have some of the best around. And they are some of the biggest around. They have enough sauce choices that anyone and everyone should have no problem finding some that they like. The problem is with some many choices it's hard to pick. The best deal is the 25 wings with choice of 5 sauces. They fries are ok. But the onion rings were very good and it's hard to find good rings anymore. The reason for only 4 stars was because they couldn't show the Appalachian State football game today."}
{"text":"The wings are okay, but nothing special. It was a busy night because the Panthers were playing so the service was a little slow."}
{"text":"We have been going to Wing-King for years, and have always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Typically in there at least monthly.  BUT, the conversation over dinner the other night went something like \"If we hadn't been in here so much, this would be our last time.\"  At the risk of blaming the owners for the actions of their staff, it was pretty crappy.  Cold food, inattentive service, a waitress who went MIA for long periods- the whole mantra of what to do wrong in a restaurant.  And it wasn't crowded!  Another snippet of conversation was, \"Slightly less honest people would have just walked out and stiffed any waitress who made us wait this long to get the check.\"  It'll be a while before we go back."}
{"text":"Okay, so you don't go for the ambiance, but the honey hot wings are the best I've ever had. Everyone at Microsoft eats there and I make it a weekly trip. Once you get a taste of them, you will crave them fortnightly. Today, we're going to find out what a smoke-free Wing King is like. Hoping the smoke didn't make the flavor."}
{"text":"Wow, been here several times and  decided to try the Grilled wings. These are the best ever! Smoky, crisp, juicy, tender! Get the Honey Hot Teriyaki and get them wet. They are killer!"}
{"text":"The wings are great no complaints. If you can get passed all the eyes which fix on you from the bar as you walk in you will have a good experience."}
{"text":"Excellent wings, buffalo shrimp, chicken fingers, wing chips and ice cold beer.  Wide variety of sauces."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Wing King quite a few times and really enjoyed it.  Today we dined in.  Our server had THE WORST attitude.  She would not smile. She would barely look at us. She was this way with the table behind us too. Just a miserable person.  It was very uncomfortable having to deal with her. To make matters worse, there was a hair in my food.  Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Las mejores alitas que he probado, sobre todo las de lemon pepper.. voy todos los fines de semana sin falta.."}
{"text":"I would come here just for the onion rings. Some of the best I have ever had. I get the garlic parm. wings. They are very good, but sometimes the drumettes are a little dry."}
{"text":"This is literally down the road from us, so we go there a lot.  The wings are great, and so are the Southwestern Egg Rolls! There are always good beer offers (tap & bottle) and the tables outside are a plus.  The staff is nice & friendly, but things don't run smoothly. I'm not sure if they don't have a lot of servers, but there have been times where we waited for a while...  We'll keep on going. Food's good, location's good for us. Why not, right? ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Wing places, anywhere. It is small place half bar half eating; paper plates, plastic forks - you get the picture -. They may offer something other than Chicken Wings, Strips and nuggets but I don't know about it other than some of their sides. They have a very good selection of sauces and dry rubs. My favorite is a combination of Lemon Pepper with Smoking Sauce on the side. They do cook to order, meaning that if you like them crispy like I do, you can get it."}
{"text":"Great wings.  We stopped after a Long day at Carowinds.  Thanks Yelp for helping us find someplace close to the park. The wings were excellent.  We had hot garlic(they use minced garlic!), lemon pepper, teriyaki, Maui wowie, and salt & vinegar. All were very good.  Ranch and. Blue cheese were tasty. My wife had a fish sandwich which she said was very good. She was a little nervous about it being a fish sandwich from a wing place. Good stop on the way home."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating the 24K wings and Maui Powie wings last night with fried green beans & pickles.  The ranch is plentiful, wing sauce powerful, and selections are endless.  I also like that they mix flavors and do not charge you  extra.  You must also try their french fries with cheese and bacon or loaded spud.  I even like their slogan \"We like them naked and wet\" or something like that.  Make sure to bring an appetite and a big ole' drink for the spicy ones."}
{"text":"For some reason I've never been impressed by this place.  The wings are OK, but not great.  And when the name of the place is Wing King, I feel like they should be epic.  There is nothing particularly wrong with the wings. After all, if you fry a chicken wing, it can't be that bad.  But they don't do anything to earn the title of \"King.\""}
{"text":"The wings are good. The lemon garlic is great. The service is horrible."}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but this place has gone downhill. The wings were over cooked. Service was horrible. It used to be a fun place with good food."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded but not too long of a wait to sit.  Service is very attentive,  every time we had more than two sips of our lemonades  she was refilling all our glasses.   I ordered the wings, well done with medium buffalo sauce and it was cooked perfectly but more of a kick than usual medium sauce, a little on the hotter side but very good.  These are probably some of the best wings I have had so far living down south.   We also had the appetizer of fried pickle chips,  it was a small order that was enough for four people.   Another item was the nachos,  nothing fancy but tasted delicious.   All in all we had a very good meal with enough to take home for another snack.  The kids grilled cheese and fries are also delicious.   We ate like a bunch of wild animals and the bill was barely  $40 for all four of us, great value and quality of food.  Now I know where I'll be getting my wings from now on."}
{"text":"Best wings around this area, but the staff are fast to ignore you of you are ordering to go food and don't always answer the phone... I know when kitchens get slow they close a little earlier at times but an hour and half early is a little disappointing and we ended up at sucky buffalo wild wing due to this one night.... Great fried pickles, great wings, for a hole in the wall it's not too shabby.... We will keep getting our wings here but not really going to hang out there ....."}
{"text":"The French fries have been horrible lately taste like they have been cooked in old grease. Fried hard and over season.  Wings are still good but hold the fries"}
{"text":"This place is famous for their wings. Google it. But sometimes you just feel like a burger. This is my second time ordering a hamburger from a wing place, and I tell you what. You will not be disappointed if you did.  I ordered a double burger, on Texas toast. The parties are big and you will be full probably with one. I forced the second one down and now I'm uncomfortable. The burger comes with the stands lettuce tomato onions. They never ask me how I want it cooked, and I don't bother telling them. The burger is fine the way they make it, in my opinion. It's around $7.25 for a Single and $9.75 for a double.   If you are ever at wing king and want to go against the grain. Get a burger. Their fried pickles are great and they come in chips or spears."}
{"text":"Eh?  Not awful.  Not sure where the big complaint about service on here is coming from.  That's the whole reason there are 2 stars.    The food is just okay.  If you don't mind dirty fryer oil and tasting what you ordered for 3 days, then this may not apply.  The food came out fairly quickly.  The sauces are truly just okay and the grease level is to the moon.  The only knock on the service is that the server wasn't able to make any recommendations and took the order counter style.  There wasn't any smile or extra service.  The reason I rated the service so highly is because the staff worked so well together that there was never an empty drink and we were checked in on by 3 different people.    Overall, meh, food isn't that great, service gets an A, I probably wouldn't drag my girlfriend here again but once again, not awful."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the fried oyster salad omg amazing!! Fried mushrooms were also yummy!!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for awhile but we have never  made it to it until this past week. I have to say they have some of the best wings I have ever had. I did the southwest and they were great, Wife got Medium and great also.  The onion rings was also good with a hint of Old Bay, but very good.   Our daughter got a burger and I had heard they had great burgers so i took a bite and it had great flavor and might have to try that the next time around.   Check it out great food, and good people watching also."}
{"text":"Wings and fries were great! Honey Hot wing sauce was delicious and the blue cheese dressing was absolutely the best I've had in awhile. The only problem was the grilled wings came out ice cold! However,  They didnt have any problem taking them back. Laid back atmosphere. I will be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"I've been loving wings since my college days...but we'll save that story for another time & site :-) This place is on my top 5 of wings spots I've tried! The Cafe' itself is small and dark. There is a a bar and tables scattered throughout. It seems to be a pretty popular spot to grab a drink, eat some wings and mingle with the locals.   I tried to wing sampler, it comes with 25 wings 5 flavors,  and since we were feeding over 5 folks we ordered 2 of them. The flavors were: buffalo, bbq, lemon pepper, jerk,...can't remember the rest (note to self, write review sooner) but they were all good! The prices were really reasonable too!   I'm gonna be in Charlotte quite a bit so I know where to go to get my wing fix!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Wing King Cafe is the variety of wings you get and the prices for the portion sizes.  Some of the wing flavors are hit or miss, and occasionally even the flavors you like are so-so on a really busy night.  However, every time we've gone the wings are always crispy and hot.  The Cajun garlic, rotisserie, and mesquite are my favorites so far.  The salt and vinegar, southwest, sweet chili, and garlic parmesan are also decent selections.  I didn't care much for the Ming, as the sauce was so dark it looked like the wing was burnt (although it's been years since I tried it).  None of the flavors I've had were overly hot.  Their blue cheese and ranch sauces are thick and tasty.    I appreciate that their regular wings are not breaded, which means we can eat them when we are watching our carbs.  They have a pretty decent selection of grilled wings as well.  Unfortunately, they don't have a great selection of healthier sides.  Everything is deep fried (and delicious) except their salads or baked potatoes, which is a bit unfortunate.  However, if you like the deep fried items, their onion rings and fried mushrooms are both pretty good - the batter is crispy and flavorful.  I haven't tried a lot of their menu other than wings and sides, but most of what I've tried has been fairly good.    The atmosphere here is a bit of a dive bar with a family room on the side, but if that isn't your thing it is easy to get their wings to go.  They are generally quick with to-go orders.  Their customer service is usually pretty quick and friendly, even when they are busy.  Overall, it's a decent spot to get wings and/or fried delights."}
{"text":"I have traveled across the U.S. for years and have yet to find Wings (and Wing sauce) as good as Wing King!  The best thing about the place is the consistency. Every time I go back the wings are cooked perfectly and seasoned just right!  I order the 10 wing basket (hot) with fries!!"}
{"text":"Tiny sports bar in a strip mall.   My first impression my party of 9 was greeted by the friendly bar tender. Because of our larger party, we were told to sit in the backroom.  Where we were immediately told by some guy that this room is closed. We retorted that we were instructed. He huffed and puffed and muttered something under his breath. Who ever told us this was not a customer.   Our server was kind. All parties of 6+ are charged an 18% gratuity fee. However we were supposed to serve our own drinks and the waitress once we told her our full party was here, took 17 minutes to take our order.   We tried to communicate to our waitress once the food was brought, where it goes. She immediately got very short. And perceived as rude. EDITED: she came with our bills, took roughly 15 minutes.   Food was good. Large portions at fair prices.    TL;DR:  Service 1/5 Food 3/5 Environment: 2/5"}
{"text":"The Food is good, but the parking lot is scary.  I am not that crazy leaving my car in the lot.  There is q scary convenient store in same parking lot too..."}
{"text":"Lots of wing choices for sauces. We had honey barbecue, hot, and grilled teriyaki. The hot was good but not nearly as impressive as the other two. The other two were awesome. Wings were moist and fries were great. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I recall seeing Wing King Cafe back in my college years (2010). Finally! My husband and I visited!!!! We arrived with a few friends around 6:30pm, were seated right away.   Their menu offers a variety of items ( sandwiches, quesadillas, wings, strips and more). I ordered ten of the Rotisserie, and Jerk flavor wings with a side of celery. My husband had ten Honey BBQ and Jerk Wings. We both disliked the Jerk flavor! However the Rotisserie was EVERYTHING!!! Love in every bite!! Needless to say, I'll probably dream about those wings tonight lol!!!   Wing King Cafe holds the Crown for the BEST wing in Charlotte!!!! I'm definitely looking forward to coming here again! I can't believe it took me this long to   Side note: beware of parking, and lock your doors."}
{"text":"With a name like wing king you would expect for their wings to be good and they are. Mild, honey hot and traditional are all pretty good. Personally I like \"wet\" garlic parm wings so their garlic Parmesan wings are not very good to me. Their salads are also pretty good and that's the lane I will be staying in to get ready for spring. The salad is a great size. I hoped for a little more chicken but it wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"Recently did a take-out order @ Wing King.  I usually make the trip out and sit down to take my time with the wings... but I was on my way somewhere and needed to get something on the way.  Even though I was taking out, the wings were exceptional.  My only complaint was that the aroma of the freshly made wings made me so hungry in the car driving to my buddies place that I was actually drooling in the car wanting to beat all the red lights so I could eat them!  I didn't time myself, but I probably set a record for how fast I consumed my wing order with cheese fries!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my \"To Try\" list for far too long....long before I was on Yelp.  FINALLY...after years, today my coworkers and I decided to brave the trek down to Carowinds Blvd to find a new wing joint.  We were not disappointed!  The restaurant resides in a small strip mall (look for the Shell gas pumps in the parking lot).  The restaurant looks small from the outside but there are plenty of tables inside.  It is seat yourself.  Napkin dispensers are on each table which if you're getting wings you will need them!  The wings are big and flavorful.  The 24 Karat have a slight mustard flavor and a bit of a kick and I can see these becoming my favorite.  Celery is extra but it's still worth it.  The crinkle cut fries are crisp with a nice flavor.    Staff was excellent here.  I think I just found my new favorite wing joint!"}
{"text":"Lunch June 11   Yep, 4 Stars to a WING JOINT!   Here's why: 1) Awesome variety of Flavors - too many flavors to list - many unique and creative! 2) We tried 6 flavors of wings and all were awesome!     - Our favorites were Mesquite & Teriyaki     - All wings came out hot and juicy 3) King Sampler at $19.95 is a great value  4) Homemade Ranch dressing for salad and dipping sauce was very tasty! 5) Waiter suggested the \"re-fired\" Honey Hot Wings and we got some -- WOW!      (TIP) --  Waiter said all wings were better if ordered \"re-fired\"  6) Menu prices very reasonable  ++ Only drawback was the coleslaw - it was awful!  If you want to make your meal/order a \"platter\" DONT, just order the fries on the side!  I will definitely go back and try more flavors and options!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The wings are delicious! They are fast and when you're in the mood for a super casual dinner or looking for somewhere to watch the gam it's a great, relaxed environment!"}
{"text":"Best wings hands down! Perfectly cooked wings with plenty of sauce or season flavors to choose from. I love that the wings are crisp and not soggy like some places. My favorite flavors are the honey gold, sweet & tangy mustard and garlic parmesan. Ummm oh so tasty!  This place is located in a shopping plaza, nothing fancy outside or inside. What matters is the service and food is great."}
{"text":"This place is a dive but their wings are off the chain! And they make their own Blue cheese!"}
{"text":"I'll chime in to support most of what has already been mentioned - the place aesthetically isn't that great but they do have awesome wings.  I get the garic parmesan wings every time.  MMM MMM MMM Good!"}
{"text":"Cajun grilled wings were fantastic. fried green beans very good. crinkle fries.  Everything was very good...the service included. waiting for a T-shirt."}
{"text":"Typically enjoy the food here but the service can be spotty. It was horrible tonight. Unbelievable. The worst service that I have seen anywhere in a long time. After a long wait at our table, our server was rude and very clear that we should expect bad service because she was \"just to busy to provide anything but the basics.\"  We decided to leave and give our business to a restaurant that would appreciate it. Thanks Hobo's for a great meal with excellent service. Sad that Wing King may be off my list even though it is super close to home."}
{"text":"Awesome wings!! Great selection of flavors. First time we went, we sat at the bar. The bartender was really rude and she later apologized towards the end of the meal. I have no idea why she was acting like that but I'm glad she apologized. We went a second time and sat at a table and we had an awesome server. Fries are crinkle style and hot and crispy!! Ranch is so good. Got nachos too and it was huge! And we got the half order of that!"}
{"text":"Never actually been to this location but got a large to go order for our office. I got the chicken fingers and I was surprised at how huge the chicken fingers were. I could only eat 2. Their hot garlic sauce is seriously amazing. Ranch is delicious too. Crinkle cut fries are always piping hot and crispy! Coworkers got the wraps and they loved it!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I did not get to try the wings I went into get so I can't rate the wings, SORRY. However, I ordered a 10 pc wings to go for 7.95. The waitress rang it up and said that will be 9.11. I asked the waitress how we got to 9.11 and I was told the tax. In the math classes I have taken 7.95 + 7.25% has never and will never add up to 9.11. When I told the waitress that was not right, THATS when I was told there is a .50 cent to go charge . I have NEVER heard of or have been charged a to go charge in my life?.  I would have paid it if I was told up front. I understand to go boxes and containers cost but don't tell me it's TAX like I'm stupid ?. Beware of this charge."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in Charlotte so far! Did a takeout order like a week ago and I was in heaven! I saw that others mentioned it was not a pretty place and its not but from previous encounters I've had with ugly restaurants I knew that just meant more than likely they'd be the bomb.com and they were. The night I went they were also having some sort of trivia the place was full and people were having fun. I will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my son after school and we had great service and food was delish! Loved the buffalo wings and my son loved his burger. We will be back. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been back to Wing King since moving out of Fort Mill, so, while in the area, we stopped in. The outside eating area is great...until smokers light up, then your air is contaminated with cancer.  The fried green beans were amazing, but our fried pickles were lacking. They were soggy and floppy. My friends' boneless wings were good, delicious sauces. My buffalo chicken Philly sandwich was disappointing. The chicken tasted twice-cooked, rubbery and dry. Not sure if this is a consistent level of cooking, but I could have passed on most of my meal.  One perk: crinkle-cut fries!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Orders wings to go. Did not get our complete order. Manager was extremely rude. Never been yelled at by a manager that his staff forgot to add stuff and would not let us speak! Will never go back. Very rude unprofessional."}
{"text":"I got a order of honey bbq wings to go and some fries. They have so many flavors to choose from I wanted to try them all. The to go order was ready in 10 minutes. The wings were a good size and everything was nice and fresh. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Having spent most of life as a vegetarian, and now dabbling in poultry after pregnancy and having children, sitting around a table watching people suck the meat off wings and drumsticks is, well, slightly gag-a-rific! (I'm an LA girl people, whaddya want?? )I shudder to think about how many live creatures all these \"wings\" add up to. My husband no doubt can do away with at least about 10 of these little guys and gals in one sitting. ......moment of silence......   Having said that, I have enjoyed a more than a few wings at Wing King. That's kind of a big deal because of the aforementioned reasons. However, I find it a little more palatable having strips or \"tenders.\" The breast meat sans bones is less caveman-y.   They offer a variety of sauces, 20 or so. They range in heat, sweet, tangy, spicy , salty and garlicky. My favorite are the honey hot. We've always accompanied our order with some onion rings or deep fried pickles. Maybe even both.   Let me just say that any combination of the above is quite the grease party. Not to say there aren't healthier options, there are. We just don't ever get any of them here. What's the point? It's Wing King, am I right? But if you're the healthy one in the bunch, there's something for you. You can get get grilled strips (why???)  or a salad (hehe.)  Actually, the salads are ok. But, the dressings are VERY good! If you're a fan of he creamy styles like blue cheese and ranch,  you will not be disappointed!!   I have had all good experiences dining here. I only had one not so bueno moment when I picked up and order of regular strips with blue cheese but was given the grilled strips with ranch. It was not what I wanted. I waited several minutes for the waitress/hostess to get less busy so I could let her know. But she insisted it was correct.  I pressed a little more. I didn't look right to me. But again she insisted and seemed a tad annoyed. So I left. It was totally not what I ordered. I didn't enjoy them at all. Boo on her for not believing me."}
{"text":"I'm not a wing person, they just haven't appealed to me.... until now. And I have no idea why, but their plain fries were amazing. I don't remember the flavors we got but the honey BBQ one was amazing, so was lemon pepper. The chipotle one was the only one we didn't like. They're awesome wings.... Ugh, it's just so far away from Huntersville :("}
{"text":"The wings are ridiculously good, very meaty.  They have a sampler where you can get 5 sets of 5 for just $23 something.  I wanted medium, they were very flavorful and had lots of sauce, just the right amount of heat.  Hubby likes the hot stuff so he ordered XXX, loved them he would have liked a little more heat (he likes the wild at BW3).  We also had the southern, they are deep fried and super crispy.  Hot ranch is zesty, about medium heat and then we also had the Maui wowie, very good medium heat not too sweet.  Their French fries are crinkle cut with a little bit of spice on them.  This was our first time in even though we have been in the area for a year...we are kicking ourselves for not trying it earlier.  The atmosphere is like neighborhood bar, a couple tables had kids (Sunday afternoon) very mixed crowd, very comfortable and the service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be going back.  I enthusiastically recommend that you try this place.  My hubby said \"they are a bad @$$ kitchen with a dive bar hanging off of it\"!    Yum!"}
{"text":"Best wings in the area for a great price. Always great customer service and never a long wait  unless there is a sport event. I personally recommend the honey hot wings"}
{"text":"I Love this place... I always get take out and always the spicy BBQ... The fried pickles are great... I Love the friendly atmosphere and great service..."}
{"text":"Loved the hot honey teriyaki wings!  Yum. Gets really busy during lunch and space Is at a premium."}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love their wings here!!! I have never been disappointed in their wings. Only complaint  I have is their phone system. Trying to call in an order ahead of time is a disaster cause you can't ever get anyone on the phone or they have a hard time hearing you."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite watering holes, but the food can be hit or miss.  When it's on, it's some of the best wings around but the consistency is just not there.  I will say my favorite item on the menu are the grilled wings, all flapper, charred, XXX Teriyaki.  So good!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been getting to go here for the last 8 months and every time it's been pretty awesome took my dad for lunch one day too even though it was some weird hours the day everyone was really friendly and the food was as always amazing thank you only downfall is there's not enough seats at the bar"}
{"text":"I've never been on the inside. (my girlfriend pick it up on the way in from work) I LOVE IT MY favorites are  Garlic Lemon Pepper Garlic Parmesan  Rotisserie Grill Lemon Pepper  i have told my girlfriend we're going to have to get every kind of wing until I have tried them all.   I'm skeptical about Oysters, livers because ummmmm... kinda like getting a Chicken Sandwich from a Fish place... seems outta place to me.. but imma try it anyway..sooner or later.   i'm a Blue Cheese kinda guy.. I like it with the chucks. (when ordering I usually ask if the Blue Cheese is a sause or if it has the chunks)  If you're the \"fraddy cat\" type of person you may wanna call your order in and leave your car running.. But if not... Go in and enjoy.. (I just text my girlfriend and told her WE'RE GOING TO WING KING TODAY.....AFTER WORK)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the wings are ok. Both times the sauces were super salty and I could barely eat. I tried garlic Parmesan and not only were they salty they were spicy. The waitress Said they shouldn't be and offered something else. Both visits we got fried pickles but again very salty. I wonder if its their oil or they just add too much salt? Last visit got the hot ranch, so bad couldn't eat again. They were hot wings with ranch powder on top... Every other wing place they mix with ranch sauce. My husband got the 24k and he said they were ok, little overcooked. Just an average place, don't think I will return. Especially after we told the waitress about the wings and she still charged us, atleast offer something else."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now, and my overall review is great. I really like the relaxed atmosphere, and the wing flavors I've had (honey mustard and cajun garlic) have been REALLY good. This is my favorite wing place in Charlotte.   However I've found the food and service quality depends a lot on when you visit. Both times I went on weeknights, I've had excellent experiences. The wings are moist and delicious, the fries are cooked really well, and the waitress was attentive. But when I visited on a Saturday night (around the same time), it was very different. Not only was it really difficult to get service from the waitress, but the food was much worse. The wings were over-breaded and over-cooked, and the fries were soggy. So underwhelming! They were busier when I went on the Saturday, but they weren't so busy that I can overlook the poor quality."}
{"text":"All around decent spot. Food is decent, service is decent. Nothing to go crazy about but definitely a go to if you're in the mood for something tasty and filling! Always great drink specials as well!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because the good reviews got me in the mood for some wings. They definitely have a wide variety to choose from. I went with the garlic parmesean and the good ol' hot wings. The hot wings were good but nothing incredibly special. Just your standard wings dipped in hot sauce. I thought the garlic parmesean wings were going to be the ticket... Unfortunately they had way too much garlic coated on them for me. I was thinking it would have a little garlic with some parmesean sprinkled over them but these things were coated, smothered, and covered with a chunky garlic paste. I really like garlic but it was just too much for me to stomach. I'm sure someone who really loves garlic might like these, but not the average person... I doubt I'll go out of my way to order lunch from here again but if I'm ever in the mood for some wings and I happen to be close by I would probably give it another shot."}
{"text":"Went back to Wing King (or as we have affectionately nicknamed it Wang Kangg). This time I went with the chicken fingers and fries. Oh.Man. These chicken fingers were so delicious! They were a perfect mixture of crispy, flavorful and really good quality chicken (very important in my book). I enjoyed the sweet chili sauce so much last time, I went with it again. Next time I will switch it up, I promised myself, I have heard the garlic parm and honey hot are equally amazing.  Fries are coated in a nice seasoning that gives a little kick and makes them pretty addicting. Place gets packed at lunchtime, but so worth it."}
{"text":"My son loves this place.  But after our last takeout order from here, I had a fraudulent charge on my credit card the same night.  Someone here loves Bass Pro Shop online shopping."}
{"text":"I found my new wing spot in Charlotte!   I'm really indecisive so was glad to see for 25.99 you get 25 wings and 5 flavors.  Tried the honey hot,  24 karat gold, medium and honey mustard.  My favorite were the honey hots.    The ranch dressing was homemade and have a good portion size.    Also, ordered the appetizers sampler of fried mushrooms, onion rings and fried green beans.  Definitely all made in house.   Service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the wings aren't bad either. I'd recommend the fried pickles to start off with."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. We had the 25 wing sampler platter and could only eat 18 because the wings were so big. Waitress was nice and very helpful. Would recommend for wings over all others."}
{"text":"Not too glorious looking on the outside, but pay no mind. The food is great!  We got 2 kinds of wings, fries, crispy green beans and brownie bites to go. Delicious!  Everything was really, really tasty. My husband had the sweet and spicy mustard sauce on his wings, I had honey BBQ.   I wish I could give a 4.5. My only complaint is that it was in out opinion a LITTLE pricy for takeout but so tasty!  We'll go again!"}
{"text":"BEST WINGS PERIOD!!  Get them re-fired for an extra crisp.  Fried mushrooms are amazing here.  I will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Favorite wings, great bar food. The signature buffalo chicken sandwich best I've ever had. The corn hole in the side room is fun while you watch the games or just hang out. Great place to watch Panthers games. Real excitement for the HOME team....but if you are looking for a great craft beer to go with your wings they will let you down. Fat Tire is it, just soul-less corporate beers. But that is the only downside. To the ownership...how bout bring in some local beer, NoDA...Birdsong...just a thought."}
{"text":"Great wings with tons of specialty flavors. We got honey BBQ, Parmesan garlic, garlic teriyaki, sweet chili, and honey gold. The garlic teriyaki was mostly just garlic, I didn't taste any teriyaki. They were all quite delicious though. Sweet chili and Parmesan garlic were my favorites."}
{"text":"How could you not love the wings?! I mean, they were rated #1 in Charlotte by CharlotteAgenda.com for a reason! But seriously, these wings are delicious.   I also enjoyed the chicken salad wrap. I'm not a big fan of wraps, or chicken salad, so why I got it I'm not sure but it was really good.. so id say get that if you aren't in the mood for wings."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood place where you can come eat some good wings, watch sports, & talk with the local people in the community! The staff was attentive and the food came out quick and piping hot! We all order different flavored of their wings and everyone we had tasted pretty good. They have over 20 different flavors. My husband had their turkey burger and sweet potato fries .. The only thing it was a turkey patty and not made from scratch that's the only compliant we had besides that a great spot to hang out at after a long day and work to unwind"}
{"text":"By far the BEST wings I've ever had!! 24 karat and honey hot are my 2 favorite flavors. We love this place so much we drive there from Gastonia everytime we want wings! Anytime my friends come into town from Savannah or Greenville they always ask me to take them back to wing king since I took them in the past!"}
{"text":"These XXX wings and Bleu Cheese were f#@$ing GREAT!! I frequent Wing King at LEAST once a week... Thankfully the gym is right up the street   You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"So far the best wings I have ever had. Recommend the hot garlic Parmesan or if you more on the country side the southern fried wings which come with gravy!"}
{"text":"My family and I love getting take out from the Wing King Cafe!  They do a really good job at making sure you have everything you need.    Their wings are really decent.  The Ranch flavor is one of my favorites along with the Medium Buffalo style.    My husband loves their burgers!  He says they're always juicy and have a really good flavor.  One of my favorite items on the menu are the fried mushrooms!  So yummy and they have a little bite to them!  Love dipping them in the ranch dressing.  Their fried pickles are yummy as well!"}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in Charlotte hands down. My favorite are the hot garlic Parmesan. The beer is super cheap and it's just a nice chill place to go eat and have a drink."}
{"text":"Our usual Tuesday get together usually involves wings and beer. Lately, it's been the Wing King in Fort Mill. This time, we decided to get past the fact that this WK is actually in a gas station plaza and give it a try.  I opted for 15 honey hot BBQ boneless wings. A little drippy in the sauce department, but the chicken bits were cooked right, the sauce tasted great and they were piping hot.  Good choice. Beer specials, or at least reasonably priced beer. Lots of stuff that's been fried. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Wings in Fort Mill? Yes, they have them. The Tuesday night bunch usually have wings and beer and we sit at the table for a couple of hours telling tall tales and making inappropriate comments about the wait staff. So we know wings. And the Wing King is... meh. The prices aren't great, the beer specials aren't great and the wings... aren't great. Even though they have about thirty different flavors and boneless too. I found them to be a little too well fried and when they brought six orders to the table, mind were barely above room temperature.  The fried pickle chips are great and the onion rings are great, but the wings are only blah. I had higher hopes for the wing \"King\".  I'm sorry, your highness. I'll be here if the guys choose it but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years probably because it's ok the other side of town for me but it was definitely worth the drive! It was still as good as I remember it being. I ordered 10 wings half hot and half lemon pepper as well as the buffalo oysters. They were some of the best fried oysters I've had and the wings as always were on point. Just the right amount of seasoning and sauce on all of it. They also have some of the best Bleu cheese dressing. I called in the order and the bartender was super helpful with all my questions and even me calling right back after we hung up to change my order. I was told 15-20min and I arrived in 17mins and it was right there ready for me. The bartender was fast and friendly getting to me and ringing me up. I will be making this drive more often when I am craving wings!"}
{"text":"This is the same local chain in the Charlotte area with locations by Carowinds, and in Rock Hill.  As for this location, the staff is friendly, the prices are good and their wings are decent with a good selection of flavors.  It is a little out of the way, much like the other wing place in the exact same facility- hopefully this one survives."}
{"text":"OK I've had to change my opinion! I called to the Wing King today and ask them if they would specially mix batter for my fried mushrooms between the children's batter than the regular spicy batter and they did it. The simplest of solutions is just ask a question sometimes"}
{"text":"Here's something I don't eat.  Wings.  But there's so much more to the menu here at Wing King.  Between fried pickles (spears OR chips), raw fries (chips), fried...other things, and french fries, there's really no way to go wrong.  While the Mr opts for wings in the Honey Hot BBQ sauce, I order a HUGE side of fries with bleu cheese and Honey Hot BBQ on the side for dipping.  Nothing makes the inner fat kid happy like dunking some crispy, hot french fries into a ramekin of cheese. So, so good.  Beer selection is reasonable, bathrooms tidy and clientele delightful. You'll find all kinds of people here, regulars at the bar and families in tables and booths around the restaurant.  It's pretty inexpensive, too.  All in all, it's no wonder that Wing King ranks up there with the best in Charlotte. Go see for yourself! It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I found this place on the way home fro a Charlotte Knights game. It was pretty late, but the staff was friendly, the service was great and man what great wings.  Better than Buffalo Wild Wings.  Very friendly bartender and food was priced right. Definitely my new favorite wing place."}
{"text":"More wings pleaseeeeeee.. I actually had a chance once before to taste wing kings cafe wings at a fight party recently and i fell in love! This place has more than enough different flavors of wings to choose from which is what i like about them. May i add i can just eat  their homemade  ranch dressing alone by itself its so yummy. Honey hot were the wings we decided on and of coarse you can mix and match but we kept it simple this time. The name definetly matches the concept because of the great selection of wings they offer. Yet have  i tasted wings better than wing king as of yet right now they take the cake for the best wings in charlotte!"}
{"text":"The Wing King cafe does not mess around. As others mentioned, it isn't much of a restaurant. Its somewhat of an eyesore actually, but that kinda adds to the charm. No frills about it. They mean business and it vaguely reminds me of the coop. This is a great find, great hole in the wall.   Wings. This place has some of the best wing's I've ever had. 10 bazillion times better then wild wing cafe. In fact I think wild wing sucks. Here, wings are perfectly fried, and juicy. Without sauce they also taste great. They have a multitude, I mean multitude of sauces. As Julie R mentioned, go with the sampler.   The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don't frequent it too often and it's out in the boonies in comparison to my location. I also haven't tried anything else on the menu.   BTW: if you go searching for this place, there is a Chinese restaurant across the street called the Wang King Cafe. Wrong spot, don't go there!"}
{"text":"I only get my order for take out, so I can't review the in house service. With that being said, the take out service is very good. Fast and accurate. I have tried several wing flavors and they are all excellent. The fries are good (very salty, but you can get them with no salt if you ask) and the blue cheese is chunky and fresh. If you're in the mood for a good plate of wings, this is a top pick."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place looking around on Yelp while visiting family. I ordered fried pickles to share, wings & french fries for myself. Pickles were awesome, wings were perfect... Crispy but still juicy. Our waitress was super nice and accommodating... I'll be back on my next visit down!"}
{"text":"Laura and Wing King....great combo! I haven't had good wings in a really long time...until today! The Wings and Quesadillas were both great!  Very friendly staff! Great atmosphere, even with a small child. Indoor and outdoor seating are available with several TVs and enjoyable music in the background. Thanks Laura. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I must say, being a avid wing guy I haven't had wings this good in long time!  I enjoyed the flavor and the blue cheese (thick like I like it).  They also have a small bar to have a drink while you enjoying those great wings.  A lot of places have those fatty flappy wings but these wings I could eat with my eyes wide open enjoying every bite.  If your near this place, stop by and grab to Hot BBQ with blue cheese and you'll be smacking your lips and licking your fingers with joy"}
{"text":"I don't know if Saturday afternoon is a bad time to go or not, but when we showed up a lot of the tables were not clean, the chair I was going to sit in had BBQ all over it so I had to pull a chair from a different table.  No biggie...  Then, the service was terrible.  The waitress was probably having a bad day of, \"I don't give a ****.\"     Then I noticed she was refilling our drinks with a cup that had lipstick stain on it!  Really?!     The wings tasted great.  Were a bit dry, but overall it was good.     Needless to say, I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Build your own burger and roll it in your favorite wing sauce... You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My first visit here and the lady at the bar was super pleasant. The wings are made to order (especially grilled) but I waited less than 10 minutes before I was back out the door... And that says a lot for this place during the lunch rush.   I would definitely return and try some other options. Lol I was so hungry, I ate my wings before remember I was supposed to snap a pic for my Yelp buddies. I will try again next time."}
{"text":"My son and I use to eat here every Saturday. My job schedule changed so we stopped going weekly. We went today for lunch and it was disappointing. The food was okay but the service was very sloppy. I wasn't sure who our server was because 2 different people waited on us, but never explained why. Neither told us their name. Neither smiled. No personality at all!!! They all looked to be around 18 with no experience or training at all. Definitely need new servers or at least better training!!"}
