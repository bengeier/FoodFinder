{"text":"Very friendly owner greeted us with a smile and inquired if we had questions about the menu. Very engaging who clearly cares about the food. Fairly straightforward Afghani kabob menu. We ordered the tandoori chicken, Waziri, and Sultani kabob meals. For $45 we got enough food to feed 4 people (1 who eats as if he is 2 people) with a little rice leftover. The brown basmati rice had a nice texture and was well seasoned. All of the meat was tender; the chicken remarkably so considering it is breast, and not thigh meat. Each meal comes with rice,salad, garlic and hot sauce, and steaming bread fresh from the tandoor. My only regret about the meal is we got it as takeout. The bread was good, but would've been amazing if we are in house. Hoping they're around for awhile. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekend afternoon, great service and good food, the server was very nice to us, we split a meal of the chicken breast kabob. The seasoning wasn't as heavy as the other Afghani restaurants I've been to, but it was still a very delicious meal! Recommended to anyone who wants to try out this type of cuisine or for a good go-to Afghani restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim yesterday, glad I tried it.  The place looks nondescript from the outside...in a plaza near Sherway...but it is spotless inside.  Service is extremely friendly and personable, and they clearly take pride in what they do here.  Menu is fairly focussed, but VERY well done - fresh and made to order, so expect a slight wait.  We tried the kofta, tandoori chicken, and lamb chop kabobs - all very tasty and moist.  Seasoning is subtle - they don't seem to be too heavy-handed with the salt; condiments of hot sauce & a yogurt based dip complement nicely.  Sides are more than an afterthought: fresh salad nicely dressed, fragrant rice, naan.  Prices are decent for the quality, though not rock bottom...definitely fair for quality of ingredients and preparation.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried it as reviews were great but had the worst experience ever, everything was burnt ( like literally black chicken and naan) Zero stars!!"}
{"text":"I'm an otr driver and have eaten in many kabob places but this has to be the finest place ever. Everything is made fresh on site and the chef and his staff are verry freindly. Many thx and congratulations keep up the good work.   Nathalie"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a short industrial stretch along the West Mall across the street from a container yard between the Queensway and Bloor.  It used to be a Tim Horton's and an independent coffee shop as well but now it's an Afghan restaurant.  I usually don't drive along this stretch of the West Mall but my friend had wanted to have something different and it was his turn to pick a place so he picked Mazar.

I arrived around 630 and waited for him to arrive and he was a bit late so I had a good look at the menu.  Everything looked really good as they had a mix of different meats including chicken, beef, lamb.  The dinner plates all come with rice (choice of white or brown), naan and a side salad.  There were 2 specials of the day one which included lamb and filet and another tandoori waziri plate which included kofta and tandoori chicken.  The tandoori waziri special was 14 dollars and we each ended up ordering that.  For the salad we had a choice of balsamic dressing or house.  

The ordering is cafeteria style, order at the counter and pick up at the counter.  It didn't take very long for the plates to be ready and they looked great.  We were given side sauces as well, a  tzatziki and a mild spicy sauce.  

Mazar basically has a good mix of options all at reasonable prices.  Nothing on the regular menu seems to be more than 18 dollars and all plates are pretty generous servings of everything from meats to sides.  The kofta was good but I especially liked the tandoori chicken.  It was spicy but not overwhelming.  It had a very good flavor to it while everything was cooked well and the presentation was clean.  I liked the naan as it went well with the meal while the carbs in the bread and rice are filling, the meat servings are a good proportion to the platter you get.  Basically this meal is a good sized portion of food.  While I finished it all I definitely wasn't left wanting.

The trays after your done eating go into this twin tower of tray holders.  It's kind of unusual.  Basically they don't' bus the dishes so you're sort of left to slide your tray into this holder with plates and all and the tower was rather full.  I'm not sure if they wait till it's full or until the end of the day to bother removing the trays and dishes from there.  

Cash and debit are the only accepted forms of payment."}
{"text":"Opted to stop into Mazar Kabob around 1PM on a Friday afternoon, having read nothing but positive reviews.

The restaurant is in an industrial area, with plenty of parking available.  The place itself is spotless.  The service was incredibly friendly, and the food was fantastic!!!  I had the Kofta Kabob and my husband had the Beef Tikka Kabob.   Portions are generous, and prices are very reasonable.

My husband is still talking about his meal a day later.  We are both looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Fair  price for what you get, if you are just looking for a home made meal with a good size portions.
Excellent option for delivery.
Best prices in the Etobicoke area ."}
{"text":"After months of driving by Mazar Kabob, I finally had the opportunity to try it yesterday and it did not disappoint.

Being a new customer, I figured that I would just select one simple dish. I called ahead and ordered the Kofta Kabob ($8.99) for takeout. The girl that answered was very friendly and there were no language barriers. As promised, the food was ready when I arrived. There were a few other diners but I believe they see most of their business over lunch as there are many office buildings up the road. Lots of parking at the side of the building as well.

I've never eaten Afghan food before and, if this is the way it's supposed to taste, I don't know what I've been missing all my life. First, they did not skimp on the quality of the ingredients. Everything, right down to the salad, was super fresh. The veggies were cooked to perfection with the right about of bite. The meat was subtly seasoned with flavours that I can't describe as I've never tried it before. It was not greasy or fatty and, kudos to whoever prepared it, because that person put a lot of pride into the dish. The whole wheat naan was obviously prepared onsite as it was soft and fresh and paired very nicely with the meat and a garlicy, yogurt sauce that they provided as a condiment.

I could easily eat this almost every day and not even feel like it was health food. It's wonderful for those of you who are trying to manage your weight as well those who just love grilled meat.

I would 100% recommend this restaurant because the food is top notch, healthy and great value for your money. The location is very easy to get to so please try it!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times since they opened and I'm never disappointed. Food is fresh and tasty, made to order, and the service is fast and friendly for those who are not too experienced in Afghani food. I highly recommend this place, it's our favourite take out place in the neighbourhood. 
Don't be afraid to try something new, you'd be glad you stopped by, the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Best food I ever ate. This is one spot you have to try. Great price, huge portion, friend staff."}
