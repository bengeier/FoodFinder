{"text":"Tried couple of Biryani's. Heavy on the system because of oil and overpowering flavor and mix of gongura in biryani's. Will try the regular biryanis some other time."}
{"text":"Visited couple of months back and the food was very good. Again visited today.. probably I had high expectations due to my last visit.. food was not at all good.. ordered gobi manchuria, veg biryani.. veg hakka noodles.. no taste at all.. served appetizer after serving main course."}
{"text":"Be prepared to go back hungry! If you are in an adventerous  mood to try your luck on wether you will be served or not, this is the place to visit. The staff is terribly underprepared to take on orders and serve customers. We arrived as a group of 5 and were crammed into a 4 seater saying that the larger table available is meant to seat 8. We placed our orders including a masala dosa that I ordered. Some on our group got lucky and landed their meal! After half an hour of waiting we reminder our server that part of our order still hasn't arrived and were told that it is on it's way.  15 minutes later we checked again and still no food. They did however manage to serve a couple other tables at this time. We waited another 5 minutes and  decided to give up and cancelled our remaining order.  Well I guess the one star is all I can award since I was never really served to start with! On a lighter note, maybe this is a sign to cut down on calories ;)"}
{"text":"I don't know what the fuss is. We went their with kids and parents. The food was good. Presentation was good. Taste was good and so was price. Definitely go again."}
{"text":"Shrimp Biryani was excellent and enough for a second meal. Saag paneer was creamy and delicious. Puri was steaming hot and amazing along with a delicate garlic Nan. Chicken Tikka masala too spicy for American palate - ask for mild."}
{"text":"So I ordered from these guys on grub hub. Somehow part got left, so someone from the restaurant went above and beyond and drove us the rest of the order. Which is really more than they had to do. No questions asked. Just immediately \"what was left out? We will bring it to you right away.\" It was out of the ordinary, great customer service. And the food was great. We are Indian. So we know. ;)"}
{"text":"Very good flavor, very good quality chicken, love the Naan bread.
I think I am the first to review them on Yelp.

I have enjoyed the Indian cuisine in many different countries and I can tell you this place delivered a promising flavor / also can be ordered on DoorDash."}
{"text":"Their food is really good but they serve all the foods in melamine plates/bowls which is not good at all.. most of the foods are really hot and serving in melamine bowl is not  healthy. I even told them if they could consider changing them, but it didn't happen... i  wish they serve in ceramic ware...."}
{"text":"Worst service. We asked for just 3 goat biryani and one chicken biryani and it took more than 1hr to serve. After waiting for 1hr finally our order arrives and it tastes not at all good."}
{"text":"Called to order food for dinner and seems half the kitchen was not functional. Naan wasn't available because tandoor wasn't working, Dosa wasn't an option, and paneer sabji wasn't an option. That should have been my first clue to run for the hills but I ordered anyway. Specifically told the guy that everything should be mild as kids will be eating and he said everything except 1 dish that we ordered would be made mild. We bring the food home and all the \"mild\" food was so spicy it was not edible. The food also was cold from the inside - most likely because it was just defrosted from the freezer. We called the restaurant 4 times to complain just to get hung up on.  Finally got in touch with them and had a full conversation around 845 PM (we ordered dinner at 615) where the guy said he can re-make the food - however dinner was well over and kids were fast asleep. Cold and spicy food and poor customer service! We won't be going there again!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do , Please do not eat boneless chicken biryani here. It's just rice mixed with left over chicken, which tastes like cardboard.
Their chicken dum biryani used to be good but after this experience , I'm never going to be stepping in there."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Amravati multiple times now. The food is consistently good, especially the Biryani. The customer service is still below par if you go the restaurant. Best to order and take out and eat and at home."}
{"text":"This is great Indian restaurant. Delicious and spicy. The staff are so friendly.  I think Michael and I were the only non Indians. It actually felt like we were in India. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very tasty dishes ( paneer, garlic Anand, kheema biryani, ulavacharu biryani). There was some delay in taking order but a person came explained that they were understaffed that day. The great food made the wait worth. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Even though yelp showed less than average stars for this place, i still went here to give it a try. We ordered a mysore masala dosa and the two stars i gave are solely for that. Shahi paneer was listed a specialty dish in menu but it tasted aweful (gravy was pure cream). We ate two bites and left it all there. A couple things I want the management to know if they are reading this review:

1. Your servers should make sure and ask customers how the food was,they didn't.
2. When serving food on table, their fingers shouldn't be touching the food. I saw a server put biryani on someone's table and his thumb was half way thru in biryani. That's unacceptable 
3. Sambhar served was cold, it was still
Cold upon asked to reheat, pay attention to details
4. You gave us  rice and the serving bowl had rice sticking out outside the bowl, pay attention to presentation
5. If you mail coupons to invite customers, make sure to honor them rather than finding ways not to honor them. Result is I won't be coming back and won't shy away from sharing my experience with others"}
{"text":"Ohhhh emmmm geeee.  Close to home and I just discovered because an Indian friend told me to come.  Outstanding recommendation.   I had a paper dosa that came with four different dipping sauces.  John had a pur√©ed spinach with cubed cheese dish that was served with rice.  Dessert was gulab jamun.   Okay so the dessert looked like four little eye balls soaked in sugar water.  I was not expecting them to be warm.  They tasted like thick sweet donuts covered in sweet syrup. Orgasmic.   Yes, I said ORGASMIC.   We kept looking at what others were having and already anticipate coming back to try different things.   The restaurant was filled with Indian people, which is a great sign that they know what they are doing here.  Simply divine and I will be back over and over and over and over and over and over again!"}
{"text":"Curries have a very authentic flavor. The chicken khorma and the egg masala are particular favorites."}
{"text":"I don't know - I just don't know.  As it's so early, I don't know if this spot will figure it out, but I'm totally pulling for them.  

On our first visit, the quality of our dishes varied wildly from person to person, and the hunt-and-peck service was somewhere between annoying and charming - hovering and absentee.  It sounds unlikely, but that's how it was.

My chicken dish was amazing, but I waited too long to post this review to recall what it was!  My wife's saag paneer was so green it almost didn't look real, and was incredibly rich and fragrant.

The various dosas weren't available on our visit, so we look forward to trying them next time. 

Stay posted.."}
{"text":"I good Indian restaurant, with below average service. Which is why i usually end up with take out. I like that they have a huge variety in their lunch menu, but consistence is problem. I recommend the goat or chicken dum biryani. I would stay away from sea food, pretty bland. The breads and side are okay."}
{"text":"Skip the place and save your taste buds a horrid time. The service is average and experience are nothing but bad. I had ordered the chicken biriyani boneless which seemed to be the special of the restaurant, as listed in their menu card. The freshness of the flavors were long gone from the biriyani and the chicken itself was having no Taste of its own. I have had biriyani the very same place couple of time but today's experience was really bad and mostly will skip any more trips to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We ordered the Simhapuri Mutton and Chicken fried rice. Both were excellent. Was thoroughly impressed with how well cooked and juicy the mutton was. Being a food connoisseur, I am always on the lookout for good mutton (goat) curries. This preparation has ensured that we'll be going back to try other items out. The ambiance was good and the entire team was very warm and welcoming. Hopefully, they maintain their quality in the long run unlike many other Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area which lost their initial sheen after getting a good Customer base..."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about here. The food is just about ok. I think there are better restaurants than Amaravati that serve good Indian food. My problem with this place is again with the staff! I don't understand why they never serve water and place cutlery without asking them a lot of times. 

I'm giving 2 stars only for the food and 0 for customer service."}
{"text":"Food was good enough--nothing spectacular... and that's where good stops!  Customer Service is horrendous!  No check back!  Food is not coursed, so they bring it out whenever it is ready.  No wine/beer available.  No seltzer water. They didn't even have coffee available!  Yikes this place almost made me feel like I was eating at home not eating out.  Except if I was eating at home, I would have at least been welcome.  Wait staff not very warm and friendly, you almost feel like your imposing on them!  Again probably won't be back, also just not really a dinner restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. 

1)We ordered mango lassi and thums up which was only served half way through the dinner . The server completely forgot. 

2) We ordered cut mirchi  and yes I agree the place was crowded but when asked about the starters the server rudely responded saying it has just been 10 mins since we ordered . There is good way to say that. 

3) The cut mirchi was served without any chutney and when asked upon he asked us whether we want mint chutney ( is it not served with already? Why give an option) 

4) On top of this , the mint chutney is banged on the table when served. 

5) The person serves us another dish instead of the one we ordered and when we got the server notified, there were no apologies either."}
{"text":"I would like to begin my review with the time stamp of my arrival: 7:50. Upon enter the building I immediately noticed the insufficient amount of staff. After waiting a few minutes, I was seated. And then seated again (as that table was not correctly set up). I placed my order around 8:15, and after watching another family walk out due to not being served, I began to get nervous. Rightfully so, as my food was not served until 9:30, and even that was after asking the server a few times how it was coming along. The food was good, but not worth the wait. The copious amounts of rice did not compensate for the lack of meat and vegetables. The flavors were spectacular, yet overall I was not pleased."}
{"text":"We had ordered chole, egg biryani and Malai kofta. All the three dishes were very tasty; especially the chole. Very authentic"}
{"text":"Phone orders will not be honored by the time you reach there. Very disgusting service. Please avoid this place"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and this place is added to my regular eat out spot. We ordered fish fry, chilli chicken amaravati special, tandoori chicken and mutton sukka for appetizers. Absolutely loved chilli chicken and tandoori chicken. Fish fry would have been more spicier( instructed while ordering). 

There are more than 10 varieties to choose from biryanis and we were suggested to go with gongura chicken biryani, ulavacharu veg biryani and keema biryani and they are too good with authentic Indian flavors. 

Hope they will introduce more desert options."}
{"text":"Food is not good. I ordered take out 4 entrees. 3 were vegetarian. The dishes were all curry with very little pieces of vegetables. The vegetables were so few that you had to search for it in the curry. The Hakka noodles were horrible. Don't waste your time and money here."}
