{"text":"One of those great small, family-run, super-authentic ethnic restaurants.  There are not a TON of options on the menu, but everything I've had so far has been fresh, delicious and resonalby-priced.  Everything goes well with the Guatemalan hot sauces, and the imported Latin American soft drinks.  The tamales are moist and substantial - you can even get them cold to take home and steam yourself. The tripe soup (served with rice pilaf and two homemade tortillas) is very warm and filling - I've had this a few times already. The pupusas are tasty and come with a delicious slaw and tomato sauce.  Along with the tacos, makes a very nice appetizer or snack. The tacos are very tasty - 4 small, rolled, fried tacos, similar to taquitos or flautas, covered in sauce, served with that same coleslaw..  So far, my favourite meal here is the grilled steak.  It wasn't huge in size, but gigantic in flavour.  It was similar to carne asada - a marinated, tender piece of meat (eithier skirt steak, flank, or something similar).  I was worried it would be dry when it arrived, looking well done.  I was wrong! It was moist and tender, and it was delicious!  It was topped with a fresh salsa, and accompanied by a salad, rice pilaf, refried beans and two homemade tortillas. It was tasty and very satisfying.  I could eat this dish at least once a week. I am excited to try the grilled chicken next, as well as the breakfast, and some of the other soups.  If you live or work nearby, El Quetzal is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I got four tacos for five dollars. The ingredients were fresh, the taste was delicious, and the service was very friendly. It's also very clean."}
{"text":"I don't want to be rude but this place is not that good in my opinion. We came here once on a Saturday. It was not very busy just a guy there watching a soccer game. It still took a long time to get our food. I got the taquitos and the meat inside them was cold"}
{"text":"This here is a mom/pop shop, I took my coworkers to try this new gig I found. The store is quite small and can seat up to 15 people max. Its a small restaurant/ Latin American store.  The menu has not too many option. There is not much to choose from if you are a vegetarian or eat halal meat.  Nevertheless, the owner was able to take out meat from my dishes.   I went with Pupusas which comes with a bit of coleslaw and tomato soup...Very tasty! and I also tried their tacos which were very crispy and nice. My friend went with the grilled chicken and he loved.   Over all decent place but with a very limited menu."}
{"text":"Its alright. Nothing special. The menu is limited. 4 tacos for $5 decent tasting. Got pupusa and i liked it l. Comes with cabbage and carrots and tomato sauce. Ordered take out in the afternoon while i was on lunch break and it took about 15 mins to get food."}
{"text":"Walked in not knowing what to expect.  On my left there was a shelf with a small amount of grocery items, a refrigerated case with Jarritos soda and Inca Cola; on my right, there were a few tables; and in the back, a counter with a cash register. Looking at the all Hispanic clientele, I was wondering if I should have brushed up on my Socal Junior High Spanish. The owner runs the counter; she's a jovial woman from Guatamala who speaks English with a thick accent. Order at the counter and have a seat.   OUR ORDER: - Chicken Tacos - more like taquitos. These were small but had good taste and crunch. PS they do have regular soft tacos but the fried ones are more popular. - Pork tamale - they use pork rib meat so watch out for the bones. I liked the tender and tasty pork, but not the taste of the masa they used. - Carne Asada Plancha - again good taste (there's a theme here) but too much gristle. - Tortilla was thick: crisp on the outside and soft in the middle not the same as the Mexican type. - Pico De Gallo was salty  I wouldn't mind trying out more things on the menu if I was in the area. Rating 2.5 rounded up for good flavor and friendly service."}
{"text":"I have recently discovered this place, having a Latin American background I was happy to find it! The food here brought back memories of my visits to the land of my parents and I felt so at home among some fellow country-men.   The place is small seat may be 10 people, take out is available, and all the backing is done on site. All the food has a homemade taste which gives it that much more authenticity. The main culinary style is from Guatemala a country I know very well.   #30daysofyelp"}
