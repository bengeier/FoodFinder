{"text":"Was hesitant to go to dandelion for food, only ever been for late night bar scene. Was very pleasantly surprised by the food. Service at the bar was friendly and helpful as well. I do wish for late night that the downstairs would turn down the music. Some people want to dance and have that loud scene, maybe keep that upstairs. Sometimes I want to hang out, sit down, chat with friends, it would be nice to have both in one bar. Dandelion has that opportunity, having 2 floors, to appeal to both crowds!"}
{"text":"I just grabbed a quick lunch to take back to my desk...the soup of the day was delightful!! Sweet potatoes puréed to perfection with fresh, cracked pepper and ginger!! It was amazing!! I complimented it with a fresh side salad (spring mix with cumbers & cherry tomatoes) and the best balsamic vinaigrette dressing! This was a refreshing and wonderful lunch! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We were optimistic for Sunday Brunch based on four overall Yelp stars, but this ended up being one of our worst dining out experiences. Ever.  I ordered the crab cakes Benedict, and I didn't know you could make crab taste bad, but they did. It was dry, old, and chewy. The hollandaise wasn't bad, but there was so little of it you almost didn't know it was there. I ordered a side of grits for $2.50, figuring they'd be worth the hefty price tag, but they were stale, tasteless, and so old and overcooked they were just a homogenized mush. It was a disgrace to one of the South's most sacred dishes.  Service was almost nonexistent. I had to ask another waitress for a refill of water because we never saw ours after we were seated.   Bonus? The waitress of the adjacent table sprayed cleaner in my direction, splashing me with chemicals that, judging by the immediate burning sensation, weren't meant to be applied directly to human skin.  All in all, the tab was skyrocket high for the quality, what service there was came with a frown or a spritz of chemicals, and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Portions are small, but unique and delicious. You won't be getting american-style huge plates, but every dish will be a complete treat. Some chefs get adventurous in a bad way, but this menu is definitely a winner.   wild mushrooms: incredible taste, cooked perfectly chicken wings: better than average, but this dish really excelled due to the custom ranch. I didn't know ranch could be made to taste like that! lamb lollipops: small portion (half-rack is two ribs), but the cherry sauce is insane. The lamb meat was good by itself, fairly little seasoning so you're mainly getting lamb meat and a really tasty sauce buttered scallops: 3 scallops to a plate, but they are incredible. Quite buttery, but the low # of scallops keeps you from being overwhelmed. They are cooked quite well, not soggy at all  Our bill would have been ~$40 for these 4 dishes, but with a coupon came out to $20.  I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"I had heard some good things from someone I know - after my experience there this weekend and checking back with that person it appears they had been coming here a while.  Apparently they no longer go here often anymore because of how overcrowded it is now.  They are now charging a $5 cover for guys - which covers exactly nothing because there is no live music.  Rather than switch to \"one in, one out\" the owner just lets in as many people that show up.  It was literally impossible to move upstairs and not much better downstairs.  Good luck getting a drink.  I can't speak to the staff but had a brief interaction with the owner and he was one of the rudest people I have ever met.  Talking down to people and acting like it was a gift to be allowed in the bar.  Charlotte has too many good places to visit to waste time/money here."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3-1/2 stars, and choose 3 because it already has lots of higher ratings.  It is a busy place with a great ambiance on Friday evening.  Downstairs at least it feels more like a bar than a restaurant - minimal decor, rustic, and loud.  The service was perfect, as were the drinks.  The selection of beers on tap is excellent, and there was a good selection of wine choices on a chalk board.  The idea that the tapas-style menu is not for the hungry is specious:   Two of us shared four plates and left stuffed (the waitress recommended sharing 2-3 plates per person).  The \"warm roasted olives\" are for the serious olive lover,  I like olives and my wife loves olives but we could hardly make a dent in the big pile of olives they delivered.  They were very tasty, however.  The trio of spreads was good, although none of the spreads was exceptional.  \"Ale simmered sausage bites\" in a hot mustard sauce were tasty, but incredibly simple.  The Quattro Framiggio flatbread was the most ordinary; if there was truffle oil as advertised it was overwhelmed by the carmelized onions, and overall the flatbread did not seem to be freshly prepared.  Based on what we had and what we saw on the menu, I would say that the food offered is not as creative as the menu descriptions.  I come back to the conclusion that the Dandelion Market is more a bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Dandelion is a lot of fun when the upstairs turns into a dance club! When ever I have friends come into town, it's a favorite spot to check out. It just feels a little sketchy when they crank the table up to make room up stairs,  but its neat to see."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, close downtown location, reasonably priced and straight forward wine list and solid food.  Started with the spinach and artichoke app which was one of the best I've had--fresh and more of a composite than your fast food Philadelphia variety found almost exclusively elsewhere.  That was accompanied by calamari which was cook just right.  I then moved onto the tuna as a main course and my friend the scallops; both solid choices.  I'd certainly return.  Oh, and the bartender, was great...solid service and just great personality...if I could only recall her name to ensure she got recognized."}
{"text":"Great food!  Reasonable price! Ate at the bar because it was packed on a Thursday night at 8! Bartender was very attentive even being busy!   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"After driving past here a few times I really wanted to check it out because the interior looked really neat. When I looked online their menu looked delicious and I thought it'd be a great choice for me and my wife to go celebrate our anniversary; bad idea. First of all this place is not terrible. The food is fairly good, (ribs, crab/avocado stack, and butternut squash were good but the cheese board and southern caprese were disappointing) the beer is cold (my wife enjoyed her cocktail) and the service was exceptional. What ruined this place for me was the noise level, which was nauseatingly loud. All of the seating (including the bar) is in a small area so I understand it could be noisier than usual but they turn up the music and promote a louder atmosphere. Me and my wife could barely have a conversation and the party next to us was nearly screaming at each other. They had a game up on at the bar which encouraged a bunch of dudebros to constantly yell at the television. This was the first time I ever got a headache because of a noise level in a restaurant and it completely ruined the evening for me. Please don't advertise yourself as a \"romantic\" date night like you do on your website and then create a loud and obnoxious atmosphere like this."}
{"text":"Thus is just the place downtown needs. Great food , great price , great service. NOT pretentious. If u want a great place to eat and feel good, this is the place. Rustic feel but also contemporary feel. We had the sliders, lamb lollipops, greens beans, and cheese plate. Nothing was disappointing.  I would  definitely go back"}
{"text":"I am picky about food. The Dandelion Market passed the test. I had prosciutto and baked mussels. Both excellent. The desert was a pleasant surprise. I can bake just about anything, so I am tough to satisfy. The apple ravioli succeeded. The right balance of softness and crispness, and the cinnamon sugar on top was just the cherry on the cake. Furthermore, the ice cream was really creamy and tasty (be careful with the ice cream you serve if you want to be appreciated, that can ruin an otherwise great pie!). And last but not least, the staff was nice too."}
{"text":"Love this place. The bartenders were good guys and happy to help you out. I didn't eat but the menu looks great and the prices seem reasonable."}
{"text":"Had some friends in town staying at The Dunhill Hotel uptown, they had already been to Harvest Moon Grille the night before, which was a bummer because I really want to try that place out. After some catching up and a couple of drinks from the hotel bar we all decided to walk around the block and give Dandelion Market a go.  My wife and I have been here before so we knew more or less what to expect.  For anyone who happens to still be reading....this place is a tapas style place with an abundance of selections to fit any picky eater's desires.  There were six of us and while we waited for a table to open up I wanted to show off the upstairs area which I think is a very cool spot with high ceilings, exposed brick, a nice bar, cozy seating selections and an interesting contraption hanging in the middle of the room that is used to raise and lower a huge dining table.  They have a great selection of local brews on tap. After a drink we headed back downstairs to our table. We ordered ALL of the following items: trio of spreads, southern caprese salad, flat bread, home made chips, buttered sauteed sea scallops, pan seared ahi tuna, crab cakes, dando ribs and grilled flat iron oscar. Carrot cake and peanut butter chocolate cake rounded out the feast.  A few things really stood out for me. The pimento cheese spread that came with the trio of spreads was fantastic. The home made chips were hot and absolutely delicious coupled with a brew. The grilled flat iron oscar was just mouth-watering good, nice rare steak covered with asparagus cream sauce.  Everyone in our party left a bit tipsy (thanks to the high alcohol content of the local brews) left with with a full stomach and left with a smile on our faces.   An all around great experience. I would definitely recommend Dandelion Market, for the atmosphere, the great selection of brews on tap, great menu and good, friendly service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times with friends and I absolutely love it.   Grilled cheese with prosciutto and tomato is outstanding, and their hash browns with house made ketchup are spicy and wonderfully. The Bellini is not overly sweet and delicious.   Also I suggest the prosciutto Benny and the fresh fruit as a side. I was impressed that they didn't over or undercook the egg, it came out just right.  The Benny is a bit small so a small plate is the perfect complement for a full meal.   The service is excellent and their decor is so quaint. The Bloody Mary bar is on point with tons of options and their selection of draft local beers is pretty good. Love it here and I always recommend it for brunch to all."}
{"text":"Very cool, great space, tables well separated. Feels unique, charming, and hip. Excellent music.   As for the food, this place offers \"small plates\" - so it works like tapas. The shrimp and grits were very tasty, and the scallops were particularly delicious, with a pomegranate drizzle. The car bomb cupcake for dessert was also delightful - Guinness chocolate cupcake and an Irish whiskey caramel filling and baileys frosting.   For drinks, there's a wonderful bourbon/fig cocktail - makers mark and fig brown sugar simple syrup and an orange twist. Also interesting - all the wines are $25/bottle, and what you don't drink you can take home with you."}
{"text":"The cheeses, figs and meat platter were remarkable."}
{"text":"Good place to eat with a causal/upbeat atmosphere. Food was solid! Our table ended up getting - meatballs, mac-n-cheese, spinach & artichoke dip, fried calamari, sweet potato gnocchi and fried tomatoes.  Service was spot on and drinks were delicious!  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This bar is for people more in the early 20's, college kids on their parents couches, or technical college crowd  that like a crowded bar. Sometimes the crowd is trashy. I have not had the food, but I have gone for the bar scene, and I will not be returning.  I would go more in-depth about my experience, but afraid Yelp will screen my comment.   The DJ does NOT take requests."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere! Go early if you want a table - it gets crowded fast. The small plates are great for a group of friends. I highly recommend any of their restaurant locations, and their catering is superb!"}
{"text":"When we walked into Dandelion Market (Dang-delicious Market I should say), it was quite dark and so I wasn't really sure about it at first. We were escorted upstairs were it was much more open and brighter. They offer many different tapas style small plates to share with one another. I would say that Dandelion Market has the best Mac & Cheese of any place I have tried so far in Charlotte! Someone else ordered the lamb lollipops and the only bad thing about them was that we finished them off too fast! They were cooked very nicely and not overly cooked and full of flavor!   I'm not sure what time they stop serving food upstairs but as the night gets later, the upstairs becomes an extension of the downstairs bar. It was a place we enjoyed very much and hope to visit Dandelion Market again soon. Didn't see any Dandelion Market brush post but hope to give it a try next time we visit this place. Good job Dandelion Market, I'm really glad we ended up stopping in and not just passing it by!"}
{"text":"Wow! That's my first and last impression. My two friends and I visited the Dandelion Market for our first time Sunday. The setting was cozy and cute, very nice atmosphere even though it was not very busy. We were greeted by a friendly face and seated in a table by the window we requested. Our server was so helpful and knowledgable about the dishes that we were confused about. She had made our experience really enjoyable.   I don't know what people don't understand about TAPAS - but that means small plates/portions - if you want a full sized entree go elsewhere. I on the other hand love Tapas style you get to try everything! And get stuffed.   For dinner we did the skewers, Mac and cheese, lamb lollipops, green beans, and pickles.  Oh my gosh! My senses went wild. The food was sooooo yummy! The meat dishes were tender. The Mac and cheese though simple - was delightful. The green beans were cooked perfectly.  Loved the pickles as well their ranch dipping sauce complimented them perfectly. Quality!! I really wanted to try more but we were stuffed the menu had a lot of options though, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there over the weekend for drinks. The place was very nice and the service was good. They had a nice selection of wines and beers. Unfortunately we did not to get eat because didn't have enough time but the dishes we some come out looked delicious."}
{"text":"Food, staff, environment all fit and are balanced for what they are trying to do.  l especially enjoyed the fantastically huge plate of warm chocolate brownie covered in carmel and served with vanilla bean ice cream. The Lamb lollipops with cherry glaze are unique and made to perfection and the chorizo stuffed pepper appetizer is also a must have."}
{"text":"Lighting and noise level could use some work downstairs. Very pleased with the food and service overall."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time tonite after the Hornets game...or lack thereof. I gotta say, the food here is outstanding. My wife and I ordered 5 or 6 items from their tapas-style menu to share. We tried the prosciutto crostini which is just melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The seared scallops with arugula was great as well as the mac and cheese which comes piping hot in its own bakeware. Good selection of drinks as well, I had the \"winter-fashioned\".  It was very crowded and loud as it was getting late on a saturday, so I would recommend going earlier if you dont wanna deal with that. All in all, excellent choice and we will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with 2 friends for a Sunday hangover brunch. We walked in, easily got a table and sat down to wait and wait and wait and wait. It took over 20 minutes before the waitress took our order then we continued to wait and wait and wait some more. 55 minutes of waiting after we placed our order before the first plate of food arrived! We ordered 2 omelettes, French toast sticks and a hangover hash. Everything was good but definitely not worth a 55 minute wait!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at this establishment. The ambiance is really nice here at night. They have a bar and a few televisions where we were able to watch a few of the college football games but doesn't give off a sports bar vibe at all. The wait staff were very accommodating and attentive. My brother and I ordered four small shareable plates and we were stuffed. With just two people, we probably only needed 2 to 3 of the plates. We had the fried calamari, meatballs marinara, shrimp & grits, and grilled chicken wings. The chipotle brown sugar glaze on the wings was superb. They were so good. The calamari was honestly some of the best calamari I've ever tasted and the aioli sauce with it was so good. The shrimp and grits were really good too. The meatballs marinara was okay. The marinara sauce was a little muted for my liking. Overall, we had an amazing dining experience and will definitely be back when visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Tapas were OK but a little expensive for the quality.  The atmosphere was bar-like but fun.  The best part and worth a trip alone: the brownie & ice cream with salted caramel.  I'll be back but just for dessert and an Irish coffee."}
{"text":"Went here with a girlfriend for dinner. Being from out of town, I had called ahead of time to see about making reservations for a Saturday night at 7:30. I was told they only made reservations for large parties but that I should have no problem getting in at that time. So when I was told upon arriving that it would be an hour wait, I was a little disappointed. The hostess was very unapologetic about it and in fact, seemed like she was having a bad night. We tried to wait around the bar area but we really felt like we were in the way. Also felt like we were the oldest people in the place- we are in our early 50's. This is definitely a younger crowd place. It was so noisy- one girl was so loud, you literally could not hear anyone else. One of the hostesses came to get us and told us our table was ready. As she began to seat us, at a table for 6- with 6 menus- I realized she might be confused. Sure enough, she apologized and told us this was not our table. We had to stand around some more. When the party of 6 did not show up, the pulled the table apart and seated us again. When my friend tried to thank the hostess, she said rudely, \"I need your beeper\"- which I had already given to the other hostess.  But the food saved the day! We tried the shrimp bruschetta- it was the best dish of the night. Aldo had the trio of hummus, red pepper spread and delicious pimento cheese with warm pita bread. The crab and avocado salad was good but needed a little more seasoning. We also had the gnocchi with winter vegetables and the black bean burger. The gnocchi were cut a little too large for my liking and didn't care for the black bean burger. It was heavy and dry. Not sure I would go back for just a party of two. the food was great but the hostess should be ashamed of herself. You are in customer service, girl. Shame on you."}
{"text":"I love this place. Yummy small plates, love  the overall atmosphere. I will never turn down going to dandelion."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here this past weekend and really enjoyed the food.  They also have a nice selection of beer.   Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this place because we heard such good reviews. We walked in on Saturday afternoon and there were a few people there so we were seated fairly quick. Thats the highlight. The waitress took a while to get to us. I am not sure if she was the only one there but if thats the case they need to hire more people. When she finally came over we both order the scrambled eggs w/ potatoes and peppers. We thought this would fill us up. When it came out the whole thing was inside of a very small cast iron skillet. I was speechless. I decided to give it a chance and boy was I disappointed. Flavorless, and way too hot. No amount of salt or pepper would save it.  My girlfriend was still hungry so she ordered a side of potatoes.  She said they were okay, but I did not try them. I was too mad about this \"culinary crime\" that had been perpetrated on me.  The decor was even questionable.  I have no clue what this place is trying to be. Is it a bar, a restaurant, a lounge, an eclectic hangout for non-conformist. Whatever it is it is not for me and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm struggling with the fact that I've given Dandelion Market just 3 stars.  The service here is great.  It is, in fact, some of the best service I've had in a Charlotte restaurant.  Each server has been friendly and competent.  The beer selection here is solid.  I am impressed that they have a good number of regional craft brews on tap here.   I love tapas-style dining.  I would prefer to graze than to just put my head in a feed bag and chow down on some oversized portion of something.  The quality of food preparation here is pretty consistent.  There are some menu items that I have not liked, but it was simply personal taste and not due to anything going awry in the kitchen.  Here's my \"gripe\" with Dandelion:  I've been 5 or 6 times now and have eaten nearly everything on the menu.  Some things I want to eat a second or third time, but I no longer sit at home and think that I'm dying to eat at DM because I haven't tried \"x\" yet.  Again, this is not because the food tastes bad.  The food is great.  I would just like to see some menu rotation.  But perhaps there is rotation and I've just missed it.    If you've never eaten at Dandelion Market I highly recommend it.  It's a great restaurant and with some seasonal menu changes I'd give it 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and even has Groupons occasionally. Weekends after 10 the upstairs turns into a dance floor."}
{"text":"Cool place - serves a young and hip crowd.  Lots of small groups.   Good and friendly service.   So-so food.  We had five dishes to share.  Green beans, ahi tuna, sliders, caprese salad, and prosciutto.  Nothing stood out. Ahi tuna was the best and sliders was weakest (beef had funny flavor but dish looked appetizing).    Would go back with a group as atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, nothing spectacular....  We had the cheese board and the charcuterie for starters - nothing amazing here, but still good.  The prosciutto crostini and scallops were amazing!  The mussels were over cooked, but the sauce was a hit!  The mac-n-cheese was tasty, we think there was a hint of truffle oil.  The ambiance at night is dark and pub-like.  It is a little noisy, but not loud.  This is a great place for meeting friends for an evening out.  The wine selection is broad and reasonably priced.  The bar has quite a few taps with good beers and every liquor imaginable.  To sum it up, this place is good for a night out with friends who appreciate quality food and good drinks."}
{"text":"Good tapas, small plates. Great brunch and decent lunch. Sometimes slow. Also great place for drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite while walking through Taste of Charlotte. Did not realize until ordering it was a \"tapas-style\" small dish menu. I ordered the special - lobster and asparagus mac and cheese. It was delicious! and very filling even for a \"small\" dish. In the interest of trying something new, ordered the Big Boss D'Icer...a local brew from Raleigh - also delicious. Would definitely recommend Dandelion Market. Nice ambiance and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and an couple plates. I ordered a beer that was listed as a pint on the menu. It came in a 9oz glass. When I asked about this I was told the menu is incorrect and that high ABV beers are served in smaller glasses. The beer was 7.5%. No apology from the bartender. No effort to give me what I ordered.    I decided not to order another round."}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian options. Very friendly staff. Good selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great selection of Tapas! Drinks were great and the staff was really friendly! Even our kids loved the choices!"}
{"text":"The word I would choose to describe this dimly lit menagerie of goodness is fantastic!!I have been here a few times and have never regretted the decision to walk through the double glass doors. The servers are not always very friendly and peppy (which may be the point), but they are always efficient, polite, and do their job well. The calamari with the lemon garlic aioli is top-notch! Actually, all of it is good but maybe stay away from the flatbread...not worth the dollars or the space in your gut that can be filled with something oh so much better from their menu. The Tuesday night $15 bottle of wine is well worth the addition to your small plate selection. 5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. It took two hours plus to get my food. The only good thing was that there is no way to get over served. The food once it came was marginal at best."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  Food is always on point and I love the deal on bottles of wine.  Great atmosphere and location!"}
{"text":"This is tough to review because on one hand, the space is great. The upstairs is big and open, while the downstairs is more laid back and intimate. Both rooms have good rustic/pub/wooden décor. As expected, a great beer selection.   Here's where it disappointed. The food was just terrible. Maybe it was bad night? Also, the upstairs becomes a hip-hoppy club after 11 and it's packed. Maybe that's what some are looking for, but it threw me off a bit."}
{"text":"I travel into Charlotte and this has become my default go-to location. Great selection of beer. $8 flights of 3 craft beers. Mon is pint night with $3.50 beers and Tue is wine night with $15 bottles.   The menu is impressive and the dishes are very good. I tried a half portion of the lamb lollipops (2 pieces). It was very good, a little on the salty side but balanced out the sweet. I also tried the chorizo stuffed poblano pepper. This was a little less salty and very spicy. Only order you can handle the heat. Brussel sprouts, tuna credo, ahi tuna are all very good. Usually, a couple of small plates are good.   Overall, the food is excellent and very well priced. I even got a free beer at the end my first time because one of the rotating beer tap breweries was there and had a limited edition beer."}
{"text":"Food, drinks and staff were awesome! Had black bean sliders, shrimp and grits ( off the chain!), salad with goat cheese, sea scallops! Cocktails made perfect!"}
{"text":"I can't believe have not reviewed Dandelion yet, as it is one of my regular go to places.  Perfect for happy hour drinks, or a meal.   Casual, pub-style eatery but the menu is anything but average pub&grub. Brunch is my favorite here thanks to the tasty Migas and bloody mary bar.  Not traditional tapas, but certainly small plate style.  Good for sharing. Full list of $25 bottles of wine. Last visit each of us ( 4 people) chose one item  and it was perfect for a late night post-movie bite.  The service is consistently friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"One star is too many for this restaurant.  We have tried it 3 times and one time for brunch was just ok; the food is not very hot; don't know if it is pre-made or just sits there too long.  But today we had brunch there again and I have been in the bathroom ever since returning home & it cost $50.00 for 3 people - if it was good that would be a good deal but to make people sick is a bad thing!  My husband also does not feel well.  Only my daughter who had a sandwich is ok.  This is just a bar! Will never return!"}
{"text":"Went to the Dandelion Market because of the good reviews. I don't know if the people had too much to drink or have low standards, but I was not impressed. The atmosphere is drab black and dark. It is noisy as it has nothing to absorb the noise, the floors are wooden and it is sparsley furnished (we were upstairs). We were trying to eat the overpriced tapas and have a decent conversation with friends when all of the sudden the employees started making a huge scene while they dramatically lifted a long table off of the floor to the ceiling I guess to make room for all the partiers that they expected to come into the place, with no where to sit, standing room only. The food was so so. I couldn't believe they had mac and cheese as a tapas. It was like the frozen Stouffers kind. There were a few good ones, but for the most part, I felt we had to order 10 tapas to feed the four of us, the servings were so small. Not a very good wine selection. It is more of a bar than a place to go and eat and have a conversation with friends. I prefer to walk around the corner and go to the Wooden Vine for my wine and tapas with friends."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband on a Friday night. We were seated right away, and the service was attentive. The food was just uninspired though. We got a cheese board and charcuterie board to start. The charcuterie was very tastey, but the cheese was boring. After that, we had the crab and avocado salad and the shrimp bruschetta.  Everything tasted fresh, but was lacking in flavor. That was sort of the theme of the meal. Nothing was outright bad, but nothing made me want to come back."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Dandelion and we had a wonderful experience.   We were using a living social deal so I was not sure what to expect with the service.  I've been to places before that provided mediocre service because I had a coupon or deal.  This was not the case with Dandelion.  Our waitress (who's name I unfortunately can not remember) walked us through the menu, how the deal worked and provided suggestions on how to make the most of our evening.  The food was incredible and the wine, beer and cocktail menu was extensive.  It was a fantastic night out and I can't say enough about how great of a time we had."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on our way from Charlotte to Brevard.  What an amazing find!  The food was excellent (so much so that I'm writing this review a month after our meal!) and the service was friendly, knowledgable and quick.  You cannot go wrong here and you can certainly trust the staff to steer you in the right direction.  The fried pickles and marinated seared flatiron steak are to die for!  Make this a destination - you won't regret it!!!  PS - I don't drink beer but my husband loved the selection."}
{"text":"Instead of hitting the standard chain food fare we wanted to take a couple of our friend's visiting from out of town to a local restaurant.   Our second visit to the Dandelion Market for dinner on a Friday night was a different experience than the first.  After our first visit we played a little safe by selecting some items we thought one couldn't really go wrong with.  First, \"Baked Potato\" Croquettes.  No complaints.  Well cooked, lightly brown, fresh oil.  We went again for the Grilled Steak Skewers.  This time cooked perfectly.  Finally, the risotto special.  I wish this could be a standard item.    Lastly, our friends wanted one more item to top off their dinner so they inquired about the calamari.  The waitress told us very honestly, it completely depends on whose cooking it.  Indeed!  That could certainly explain the vast difference between the two visits.  The calamari did not disappoint.  This time as we watched food come out to the tables around us we actually wanted what they ordered!  Including the dessert which we regretfully didn't have room for.  Next time!  It would probably be in the best interest of the owners to have their best chef spend some time training the others to share the love and deliver a consistent product every time.  Consistently good food is what people are looking for in a restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place before my visit with 7 other friends a couple weeks ago.  I can tell you Dandelion Market certainly lived up to all my expectations from the service and cozy atmosphere to the delicous menu. I love the small, \"tapas\" style entrees.    You can order several selections, share with friends (my group all ordered different selections and passed them around.) I always enjoy eating small portions and feeing satisfied, not over fed.  I already had the procuitto crostini in mind.  Boy was it delicious, salty and sweet and creamy, too.  Our server stayed attentive to our table, was very helpful explaining the menu and kept the drinks coming.  I really like the carafes of water on the table, so that your water glass in never empty and you don't have to keep asking your server for more.  Great idea!    I also recommend the steak skewers and the spicy prawns and flatbreads.  The guiness  (sp) brownie is delicous.  Great beer selection too.     I loved the exposed brick interior and over stuffed chairs tucked in one nook,  great for having drinks and conversation.   All in all a great night and I hope to return again soon."}
{"text":"I didn't get the bartenders name but it was a Tuesday happy hour and he took the time to go over the drink and food menus with us. Quick service, tasty food (Apple salad n a flatbread pizza), great beer and wine selections. The small crowd was after-work, late 20s early 30s. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because of other reviews on Yelp. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. The waitress was great, too. So as far as food goes, there was 3 of us in our group. We were there for dinner and ordered a bottle of wine (all the bottles are $25!). We started with the cheese plate, the antipasto plate and the roasted red pepper and artichoke dip. We all agreed that the dip was really tasty and left none in the bowl. The cheese plate offered 3 different cheeses, nothing extraordinary but not bad. The antipasto had salami, prosciutto, sausage and pepperoni. Here again, nothing extraordinary but definitely tasty.  Next course we ordered the chicken roulade, ahi tuna, steak skewers and ribs. The ribs were fall off the bone, really good! The ahi tuna was my next favorite. The steak was a bit tough but had a good flavor. And finally the chicken roulade was just a bit overcooked (but anything with goat cheese in it is good to me).  We finished with a cheese fondue (sounds silly now, but we also were on our second bottle of wine).  All in all we enjoyed ourselves and ate all of the food. The end price was actually pretty good for all we got. We'll definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"Listen, I love exposed brick and bars with lots of atmosphere.  Dandelion Market has all that, with a rack of shoes on one wall, an elevated seating area, and of course this mythical upstairs area that we didn't get to see since it was 6 pm on a week night.  Folks at the bar were drinking and having a great time; our party of three grabbed a table to order some of their small plates and see what all the fuss was about.  The beer list is very good, but - as my husband said - \"there's nothing on here I've never tried before,\" and I felt the whole list was a tick expensive.  I'll be back on a Monday night for their $3 drafts.  As for the food, it was disappointing.  I always feel tapas places are overpriced, particularly for vegetarians, and I came away with the same feeling from Dandelion Market.  My husband and I ordered a pesto flatbread, pommes frites, and the \"deconstructed\" caprese.  The flatbread was completely unmemorable, and the most interesting part of the caprese were the balls of fried mozzarella.  Though the baby greens were limp and boring, a bite of fried mozzy, tomato, and greens was pretty all right.  The pommes frites were disappointing... when I order a $6 plate of pommes frites, I guess I expect more pommes and less frites.  When I surveyed our spread, I had a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I'd just spent $12 on a tiny, average salad and a plate of fries.  Our friend had the mussels, which were much more impressive looking, and I imagine the other meat dishes comported themselves equally well.  Sometimes it sucks to be veg.  Dessert was a salted brownie with caramel drizzle - another completely unmemorable concoction - though our friend ordered the rhubarb crumble, which was the best thing I think all of us tasted the entire evening.  I'll give Dandelion a 3-star for atmo and beer list, but I doubt I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"Great little spot for a drink.  Been here a few times before going to a play or concert.  Love the calamari one of the best in Charlotte.  The downstairs bar is small, but it is comfortable with great service.  Staff is friendly and memorable."}
{"text":"Great late night spot with good food.  Its american style tapas.  Meaning its not specifically oriented to one cuisine but its a small plate serving where you share and order multiples."}
{"text":"Came here to wait for some friends and went straight to the bar - good selection on beers! bartender was nice and friendly.  Asked her rec on food and she told me wings and the mac and cheese was worth the try... i agree. really good fresh mac and cheese, the wings were good but nothing crazy amazing so was ok on that end.   good after work place if this is what your looking for."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with some girlfriends while visiting Charlotte. I love the idea of tapas. It's fun to get a bunch of stuff and share. We got the crostini with procuitto, calamari, brussel sprouts and these fried potato balls (cant exactly remember the name of them). Everything was good, I would go back to try more things since I was still kind of hungry after we left."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The atmosphere, the menu, the wine selection, right down to their glass water bottles. I am disappointed that they took the fried sage leaves off the menu, but, they have plenty other amazing dishes to make up for it."}
{"text":"This is sort of a cross between a gastropub and a tapas bar, which sounds like it shouldn't work but believe me, it does.  They have a large number of beers on tap and a menu of interesting/innovative takes on pub grub, priced reasonably and served as small plates.  For example, between my wife and me, we had an artisan cheese plate, bacon cheddar sliders, fried calamari and some spicy raw tuna on top of crispy flatbread-like chips as well as two beers each.  Basically this let us try a bunch of awesome stuff without getting too full or breaking the bank.  Everything they served us was good; the star in my opinion was the tuna.  I appreciated the bartender's recommendations for beer, as well - I told him I was in the mood for a lager and wanted to try something new, and he had me taste his recommendation before he served up a full one.  Nice gesture."}
{"text":"I eat out atheist 4 times a week and so do most of my friends...but our main complaint is no food gets us excited anymore  Palm, Mortons you name it.... you name it..     but we went to the Dandelion market tonight and it was terrific ..I kind of stopped posting on Yelp but came back just to mention this place and food that got me excited again...and the service was fantastic. I almost hate writing this because I don't want the place to get to crowded. But trust me try this place I'm sure all the servers are capable and nice, but if you want to assure great service ask for Julie she is great...We had scallops, lamb, Gnocchi and Bruschetta. We had plenty after just three dishes but couldn't stop eating.....again great place and thanks again Julie for great service"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to meet a friend and I must say, it was probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time!   The food was amazing and the change the menu every so often so you have to go back and try every. Prices were very reasonable, and the staff were extremely polite!   Will definitely be returning here soon!"}
{"text":"We usually come here for Sunday Brunch. Most of the times the food and service is pretty good. This time however the service was terrible and our food was cold and biscuits were burnt and hard. We sat for 5 minutes without a place setting and nothing to eat our food with."}
{"text":"Try the sliders and tuna tapas. Love the choice in local beer too."}
{"text":"Dinner food is very good ! fried calamari is amazing !!!!! But when went to brunch and the food was greasy and service is always bad I'm giving them 4 stars because I know it's something that can be fixed !"}
{"text":"The draft beer selection is great the tapas style menu is a perfect match and the upstairs is a great after work gathering place. But the best thing about this place is the bartender named Siti (sp) he is one of the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Duck fat fries are awesome. The torta rustica is good but it has quite a bit of cheese. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying. I have only been to this place during the day. Specifically brunch on the weekends. That being said. They do some good stuff. Their brunch menu is fantastic. Short and simple but more than filling and delicious. A great draft beer list for a smaller place along with a bloody mary bar and mimosas galore. Food as always been quick and service friendly. Only downfall... It you can call it that. Would be the \"over easy eggs\". The yolk was completely cooked through. Now I know how easy it is to overcook an egg I do it practically every morning. That being said. Not a big deal. If you want a great low key brunch. Get here. They do it right."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for a vegan bite in Charlotte. Though there are few options on the menu. Enjoyed the black bean sliders. Nice staff, and very solid local beer selection."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is good, creative, and the small plate concept is awesome for share. If you want some place to ho and hsve good conversation with friends, Dandelion Market is the best place! Good wine selection! I suggest the Lamb! Anytime I'm in Charlotte i have to stop by."}
{"text":"Very unique spot! It's cozy with dim lighting. The tapas are delicious!! My boyfriend & I are new to the area and were wandering around for a dinner spot. When we sat down at Dandelion, we didn't realize it was only tapas. We were starving so we weren't thrilled at first. But we ordered 4 and it was plenty! We were stuffed! We each had a glass of wine and our bill was only about $60 so it wasn't too bad. We will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night without a reservation and we're sat at a one-off table with high-stools upstairs. Wasn't too crowded but packed enough. Beer selection was standard and our waitress was attentive. We ordered four plates - the stuffed sausage poblano, the meatballs, the lamb lollipops and short rib on polenta. Everything was delicious but pretty salty. Our waitress was informative since it was our first time there and attentive. I'd go back again but would just request all the dishes be less salty. Seems to be much more happening on Fridays and Saturdays. Bartender waved goodbye even though we never met him. 2 thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Fun place for a girls evening. We shared appetizers, enjoyed oversized booths and fun crowd.  Food was amazing and we shared most of it among the girls!"}
{"text":"Excellent made from scratch Bloody Marys,  the quiche was two inches high, fluffy, flaky, and delicious and the biscuits are to die for.  A must if you're in the uptown Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Great tapas restaurant. Good food and great prices. Super fun to dance upstairs late night on the weekends."}
{"text":"What a treasure!  Loved absolutely everything I tried & so did everyone in my group.  I tried the deviled eggs, beet salad, Brussel sprouts and had the scallops.  The scallops were the best I have ever had.  They were perfectly cooked and served on s bed of deliciousness!  Others in the group had the mussels, portabella fries and sliders.  All were extremely pleased and we left very pleased with our meal.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I was traveling through, killing time here before a flight out of CLT and the staff was SO nice. They let me keep my luggage safe up front. Zye, the bartender made me feel welcome, as did the doorman bry. If you're ever stuck in downtown charlotte come here and people will take very good care of you. Stupendous beer selection."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for a conference and decided to try a tapas style dining experience. Dandelion market far exceeded my expectations for new american style food. Went on a Wednesday evening - no wait or reservation needed at normal dining hours. Atmosphere was a bit dark, but then again, I believe this doubles as a night scene/bar so that is acceptable. I want to start the discourse on food by saying the waitress we had was outstanding!!! She was knowledgeable about the menu, was able to provide good suggestions from personal experience and was attentive to the table's needs. The food was excellent and some dishes were very unique (I like trying new things). Will return if I'm in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Dandelion Market is one of my favorite tapas restaurants in the QC and on my latest trip I enjoyed the market to its fullest. We wen't out with a couple friends and took full advantage of plate sharing and four hungry appetites.   We ended up splitting 20 plates by the end of the night which was just a few plates shy of breaking our personal group record of 28 plates while dining at Good Food on Montford a couple weeks prior. We started the night out by getting the Charcuterie Board, the Artisanal Cheese Board, and the Vietnamese Spring Rolls. I can't say much about the spring rolls other than they we're cold and without the accompanying slightly spicy sauce to dip them in they might not be worth recommending. The cheese board had a small assortment of salty, creamy, and savory cheeses that started off the evening on the right track and paired well with the sliced meats on the charcuterie board.    Next we dove into the Baked Potato Croquettes, the Fried Pickles, Black Bean Sliders, and the Moroccan Lamb Kabobs. The croquettes were so incredibly delicious that we ended up ordering a second plate. The little fried balls of aged cheddar, Beeler's bacon, and scallion cream are the type of thing worth making a pilgrimage out of. The fried pickles were sliced not speared and had a great crunch that made them stand out against some of Charlottes other greasy and flimsy fried pickle alternatives. The black bean sliders were largely thought of as ok but didn't leave us with any notable impression.   Then we dove into the next section with the Butter Sauteed Sea Scallops and the Pan Seared Ahi Tuna. The tuna was the clear favorite between the two dishes but the scallops still held their own and were worth recommending.   The Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops, Dando Ribs, Grilled Chicken Wings, Grilled Steak Skewers, Sausage Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Market Mac & Cheese, and the Zucchini Ribbon Pasta finished off the night. The lamb lollipops were delicious but the cherry glaze that accompanied them taste like cough syrup and was definitely a down side for the dish. The dando ribs and the chicken wings were juicy and tender but couldn't hold their weight against the crowned king of the night. The grilled steak skewers are marinated in an asian brown sugar soy sauce and a sweet chili sauce. The steak skewers melt in your mouth and create such a euphoric feeling you might end up ordering several more :)  The Mac & Cheese came with spiral noodles, a crumb topping, and plenty of CHEESE, CHEESE, and more CHEESE!!!! The Mac & Cheese was made even better by adding the sausage stuffed poblano pepper... it created a very high-end cheesy Hamburger Helper. The zucchini pasta was the only non-fried healthy vegetable plate we ordered for the night and probably a wise decision given the immense amount of meat we had eaten at that point.   No dinner is complete without dessert so we ordered a brownie sundae, an apple fritter, and a chocolate cake (to-go). The triple chocolate brownie sundae was delicious and one of the few things that should be noted as not a small plate... I repeat... this is plenty big enough to share between two people. The apple fritter left us wanting more but the accompanying ice cream made for a nice pairing between the hot apple cinnamon and the cold ice cream. The chocolate cake was topped with ganache but largely came across as an average piece of chocolate cake.   Dandelion Market is an incredible tapas restaurant and every trip leaves us counting down the days until we make a return visit. Check them out and let me know what you think :)"}
{"text":"Seems like more of a bar than a restaurant.  I hear their tapas are good so I will have to go back for that.  I had brunch there and it was alright.  They had some unique combinations but I wasn't wowed.  I will have to go back to drink."}
{"text":"Nice place, do not get the brussel sprouts if you like crunchy and tasty sprouts.  Short ribs were good but the waitress talked up the brussel sprouts and they just weren't good."}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown Charlotte to try different small plates and share with others. Think before you order! Some plates are huge like fries and Mac n cheese but others a very small-shrimp and grits. Servers will stagger your order so you can enjoy the food and not feel like you have to eat everything at once. Upstairs eating area is more favorable to me with dim lighting a more of a relaxed atmosphere. Great beer selection as well!"}
{"text":"Great for the small plate dinners and entrees alike. Dandy turns into something awesome at night with 2 floors of bars and plenty of local craft brews. Bartenders are exceptional at making your drink magically appear before you. Late night, get a basket you pomme frites, and you can thank me later."}
{"text":"This is my favorite style of restaurant because I LOVE small plates and drinks. They do everything right here and the atmosphere is rustically romantic. I highly recommend the chicken wings and fries to go with whatever cocktail calls your name."}
{"text":"Setously guys this might be the most authentic fake Irish bar in the greater charlotte area."}
{"text":"Had a work trip to Charlotte so I asked the hotel about any places it would be good to have a dinner. This was the prime recommendation.   My coworker and I easily found the place as it was very distinctive from the outside. When we were seated, the atmosphere felt much like where people can come have a meal and some drinks. I wanted to try their tomato soup with grilled cheese but that was in their lunch menu. The place has separate menus for lunch and dinner.. Both worth a visit for.   The variety was wonderful and the portions are perfect for sharing multiple plates. We got the ribs (KC style), a crab cake and zucchini pasta. Loved the crab cake and ribs. The zucchini was okay. The other table had dessert that looked to be a delight. We, unfortunately, were too full to indulge.   They had a $15 dollar wine offer that night. Perfect for groups. I got a beer and coworker got a white wine that she said was delicious.   All in all, I loved the experience and the food. Service is amazing and food is up to par.   Will come back for the lunch if I come visit Charlotte again!"}
{"text":"Food is great, everything we ordered came out very quickly and was delicious. I especially liked the prosciutto crostinis. The Resturant itself has dim lighting and brick walls which creates a nice ambiance. And we had great service. Also for brunch there's a make your own Bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The atmosphere is unassuming but the food is not. I had several plates from cheese to lamb with candied cherrys and even a carrot cake and even some scallops to top my night off.   Amazing food - decent prices and a relaxed atmosphere make this a new place in Charlotte that's near the top of my list."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really good options for brunch. I made my brunch from small plates and my only complaint is that I asked for crispy bacon and it came out less fine than I prefer but otherwise food is good. My honey had the hangover hash and it was excellent. Service could be slightly faster but overall great experience."}
{"text":"Dinner is all tapas and they're soooo good! Lots of good varieties of food. Must try the Mac b cheese & the black bean burger sliders. Really cool environment as well. Can't wait to go back!! Also, reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Wow. Gross. Ew. Steak skewers were charred black. Pomme frites were from Applebee's. French Quarter mussels tasted like a Red Baron frozen supreme pizza with less flavour. The scallops were delicious and the only saving grace. What a travesty of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great bar - Friendly patrons, friendly bartender. Exposed brick inside, very relaxed vibe. Nice selection of beers on tap-- I enjoyed a pint of the Stone Arrogant Bastard."}
{"text":"Tonight we dined at the Dandelion Market prior to our showing of the Nucracker at Blumenthal Performing Art Center.  The restaurant is perfectly situated for a short walk after eating to attend a show there.  Anyway, we had reservations and the table was ready for us as soon as we walked in the door.  There were 9 of us eating.  We had three young boys with us (7 and 8 year olds) and were told the place was family friendly.  While it was quite a bit noisy in there at least the ends of the tables were able to converse, talking to someone from one end to the other was not an option though.  After ordering our drinks we waited a little bit for them to come around but that was really the only serving snafu.  The beer menu is quite good and the pints are priced reasonably well.  We opted to bring our own bottle of wine with us for those drinking that (the corking fee was $20).  All of the bottles are priced at $25 so even that is not too bad.   The food we ordered was really good.  The calamari I ordered was a good sharable size with plenty to go around.  we actually ordered two for our table but unfortunately one of our orders was given to another table but we had so much food we really didn't miss it, the waitress was apologetic for the mistake.  We order the pom frites which were really good as well, large baskets of them, we ordered two baskets of these and honestly it was too much even for the 9 of us.    The main courses were equally good.  I had the mussels which I was told was a full pound and I believe it.  My wife ordered the lamb lollipops and she really enjoyed it.  Others in our group said their food was good as well.  All told it was an excellent place.  I will return to try other dishes.  Really the only reason I knocked a star off was because of the serving snafu and the level of noise but it isn't a very big place.  I would certainly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I came here around 7pm on a Friday night and seating for two was immediate. The place had a rustic but upscale and trendy feel which I enjoyed. I had the Mac and cheese as my entree, and It was excellent! Definitely one of the best I've had in any restaurant. The top had a breading which added a crunch to it, and the inside was deliciously creamy. The waiter was attentive and prompt as well.   Although I did not stay for drinks, I did check out the upstairs bar location which looked very fun. The friend I was eating with said that at night the large wooden table in the center is hoisted up into the air for more floor space - a very neat concept.   Overall, I definitely would recommend a visit to Dandelion Market for a quieter, cool dinner spot. And also for that delicious Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Went for snackies and drinks and was waited on by the nicest Irish bartender (Wolf???) ever. The beer taps were very nice and diverse and the tapas were equally diverse and scrumptious.  We had the calamari rings, and I think they're the best I've ever had, period.  We also had two other tapas but I can't remember (like I said nice craft brews) what they were.  I do remember we all commented on how delicious they were. The bar area is very nice, nice bar with \"angles\" so it's easier for a group of 4 to sit at the bar and see each other and talk. Nice decor, good lunch menu selections.  Would definitely want to be a regular here if we lived in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Wednesday night, atmosphere was great. We love the simple arrangements of tables and brick walls. We came to Charlotte  from the Orlando area (suprisingly foodie  friendly ), and were  expecting  to be bowled over by the food. Sadly, this wasn't  the case.  I ordered  a drink that had some fancy name but was basically  a gin ricky.  I had to send it back for more St. Germaine because it was tasteless. We ordered the cheddar  sliders which were flavorful but the bun was so dry it crumbled in your hand. Then the mussels, meh is the only thing I can say. I'm used to there being at least an inch of delicious creamy soup with giant amounts of bread. I get it, tapas. But seriously, 2 little croutons each? No worries, they were pretty bland regardless. Then the bizarre greenbeans came.  Basically take some regular ol greenbeans  and coat them in bottled sauce.  I thought they'd  be great fried as a finger food as it was tapas  but nope, wet and weird.  Service was fine, not spectacular  but average.  I  wouldn't waste my time here until they correct what's going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for a tech conference and were exploring the area. This place was such a great find. It was soooo good! The decor was so cute and everything on the menu looked delicious. I got the huevos rancheros which was just amazing. Everyone was really happy with their food."}
{"text":"Get the grilled cheese.  Don't think about the calories.  just get it.  Thick crusty well buttered artisanal bread with gooey insanely yummy cheese and a proper thick tomato soup, none of that watery from a can drips all over you soup.  My boyfriend actually stole some of my soup with his fork over the table and it didn't leave the fork, that thick.  He had the most monstrous chicken salad on a croissant sandwich i'd ever seen.  I don't know what dressing they use on their salads but it was yummy.   We met up for lunch uptown during the work week and it was well worth it.  The service was surprisingly quick and the food wasn't very expensive.   We didn't get a beer (kind of frowned upon mid afternoon during working hours!) but we have been many times for a pint and their selection is diverse and full of craft brews.  What I love most about The Dando is that the lower bar and the upper bar have completely different feels to them.  The lower bar is more small restaurant/pub and the upstairs is perfectly suited for a night out with the girls and saturday nights.  forgot to add: for those of you who work in uptown, they have a punch card for lunch!"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday around 10am so they didn't have brunch kind of disappointed. Got a mimosa anyway a champagne flute holds more than the glass they gave me, waste of money.   Chicken salad sandwich was good though."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! was in charlotte for a conference and ended up going back to this place several times. dandelion market has great food and is fun place to go if you want to try a bunch of GREAT food.  on our last night in charlotte, we showed up on a sunday night eight people in our group. with no available tables downtown stairs, the staff happily opened up the top floor for us which felt like a private party. the atmosphere here is adorable and i will forever recommend 'the dando' to anyone visiting charlotte."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Nice and cozy.  We had several items for dinner.  We had spinach dip, calamari, steak skewers and crab cake.  Brownie with ice cream for dessert.  Monday was $3 pints! Definitely going to go back again.  Service was friendly and helpful.  No complaints at all loved it"}
{"text":"Came here with a client for a dinner with 12 people. We ordered the entire menu (they offer this and it comes in waves) and it was INCREDIBLE. My favorites were the lamb lollipops, sweet and spicy green beans and the short rib. It was a wonderful first experience to get to try nearly everything so I know what to focus on when I go and have to actually pay!  There was a good selection of wine and beer and service was exceptional. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I recently spent a lovely evening at Dandelion Market enjoying some very good food. We had the entire second floor to ourselves and the service was fantastic.   It's a rustic looking pub, old exposed wood and brick with dim lighting and a cozy atmosphere. When I heard we would be dining at the \"Dandelion Market\" I was expecting a more open and bright place, more like a farmers market vibe. I was instantly reminded of the bars in Dublin at Temple Bar, which I believe is exactly what they were trying for.   They had a good sized menu of small plates for dinner, also some sandwiches and other items for lunch. I tried a bite or two of the fried pickles, grilled steak skewers, ale simmered sausage bites, tiger prawns, and the santa fe corn. I heard the market mac n cheese, baked potato croquettes, and the prosciutto crostini were all very good as well.   The service was terrific all night. We were there for about three hours and the servers kept our glasses full and made sure we were well fed.   I can't wait till the next time I'm in Charlotte and can try brunch at Dandelion Market, it sounds delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I could write two reviews for Dandelion Market-one for the upstairs and one for the downstairs because it was two completely different vibes.  I absolutely loved the downstairs area and wish I could have stayed there all night. Open seats at the bar on a Saturday night along with a friendly bartender with some football playing is all I really need in life. It had a chill vibe, exposed brick walls and  music playing just loud enough to enjoy but you could hear another speak and just seemed like a cozy atmosphere. One of my friends I was with is pregnant and the bartender Amanda whipped up a special alcohol free concoction for her. Can I please just stay downstairs forever enjoying my Shocktop?  The answer-no. We had a large party and wanted to sit down to eat and our table was upstairs  I really wanted to love this place but the upstairs kinda killed it for me. I didn't even know there was an upstairs area but when we got there, I wanted to go into the corner and crawl into a fetal position. It was like every 25 yr old hipster in town was there and every guy seemed to have either a vintage blazer and John Edwards hair (or sometimes both--eek!)  It wasn't a place to eat, it was a bar area! They had  large booths and I was sitting on the outside and kept getting elbowed by some randoms doing shots. Server was nice but they seemed to be out of alot of stuff by 9P. I got the flatbread and house salad which were both ok but nothing to write home about. The flatbread seemed more like a mini pizza than flatbread and the salad had about seven to eight pieces of lettuce with some cranberries and dressing. I could find a better salad elsewhere for $6. I just wanted to finish my meal so I could get the hell back downstairs.   I'll probably check out Dandelion again for lunch during the week or an after work drink but no way will I be venturing into hipster hell upstairs again!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to this restaurant in Charlotte, YOU MUST! Huge menu and tapas style, and I have never gotten anything I didn't like! It is a great dinner place for Friday nights before a night out on the town! Up stairs bar get rowdy late at night, so I wouldn't plan a romantic late night dinner here on a weekend, but evening would be perfect!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing foods.  From the fried pickles to the lamb to the skewers to the chicken wings to the stuffed poblano peppers and more. All were amazing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The lamb is great. Wait staff very attentive. Good beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"I love variety packs, samplers, flights, combos, mixed offerings in general. That's part of the reason why I dig tapas-style places.  Nothing pleases me more than tasting some of this and some of that.  The other part of the reason is that my dining philosophy is generally if you can make it at home with no unreasonable effort, you should just make it at home.  Now try making a tapas menu at home.  It'll take forever and it probably won't be very good.  So for me tapas/small plates = the perfect restaurant dining experience. I thoroughly enjoyed dinner at \"dando\".  Little plates of calimari, mac and cheese, ribs and a couple of other things were very tasty.  The marinated olives were a bit on the salty side.  The beer selection was of course very satisfying as well, I got a delightful, fragrant Belgian. We went back for brunch one day and honestly that was less impressive.  The fluffy fritatta was tasty, the waffle was just ok.  The coffee was not piping hot. I'd definitely come back for dinner, but it looks like my brunch search is still on."}
{"text":"I took a few clients here while on a business trip to NC and it was incredible!  I feel like sharing food with clients is a great way to form a bond.  Who wouldn't want to bond over food?!  The few highlights for me were the calamari, brussel sprouts and gnocci and fried pickles. We ordered about 3 items each and were stuffed."}
{"text":"This is almost 2 different places, but they're both great. The food during the day is fantastic - tapas and small plates to share, but everything is so delicious. Come for brunch, lunch, or dinner and you can't go wrong. After dark, the upstairs portion turns into a dance club and it's a ton of fun."}
{"text":"The Ahi tuna salad sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I get it with tomato soup almost every time I forget to pack my lunch for work. I know I'm in a rut, but it's a rut I'm happy to be in.  I've also been for dinner several times and LOVED it. I took my mom when I first moved to Charlotte and she asks to go back every time she visits.  I've never had anything I didn't like here. I would recommend the scallops and the sweet potato gnocchi in particular. Its definitely a little pricey but since it's small plates it's easy to keep the cost down if you just want to sample a couple things.   My only complaint is that they have a lunch card (I think buy 9 lunch entrees get the 10th free?) and I was about 6 lunches in before I found out about the card. They also never ask if you have one so I always forget and have only had it stamped once. If you work nearby and go for lunch a lot, take advantage of this! The staff probably won't tell you about it."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Food was over cooked. Wouldn't recommend any omelette. Only reason they get 2 stars is because service was good and they comped my omelette off. Went to 5 church and everything was better. $10 bottomless sangrias and $12 bottomless mimosas at 5 church."}
{"text":"We chose the Dandelion for its proximity to my daughter's hotel where her team is staying and for its varied menu selections as she's a vegetarian and we're not. We were promptly seated: the restaurant was busy but not overly crowded after all it was Tuesday after Christmas.  It would have helped us choose if their online menu and website had indicated that they were a small plates joint and therefore the prices were expensive for the small portions. In disclosure the waitress did tell us it was small plates after she seated us.   Short ribs, mac&cheese, a few different salads, lamb lollipops--it was excellent food all around.  The problem was the poor service.  Having to ask for a replacement napkin several times before it rang a bell. And dessert. It took at least 15 minutes for the waitress to return and apologize that there was no tiramisu then another fifteen before the single dessert appeared.  Lots of waiting and feeling ignored tonight with nobody visible to flag down. Good food is a large part of the experience but lousy service can wreck it."}
{"text":"Excellent quality small plates with wide selection of local beers. Great atmosphere and attentive servers as well.   We went on a Sunday evening (7-ish) and had no problem getting a window table even though the place was busy.   The waiter recommended 2-3 tapas per person. We selected 5 including brussels sprouts, hummus, shrimp and grits, chorizo fundido, and fried green caprese. We're not big eaters so 5 was the perfect number...six would've pushed us over the edge of comfort!  Our favorite was the hummus, topped with black olive tapenade, crisped garbonzos, and served with soft pita wedges. The hummus had just enough heat to make it interesting.   The S&G came in the form of a grit-cake with 2 huge grilled shrimp on top. We loved the taste but the grits had cream cheese mixed in so were definitely on the heavy side.  The Chorizo Fundido was more like a queso but was spicy and flavorful.   The FGC were hearty and paired with fresh mozzarella slices. Very good!  I only tried one of the brussels, which I don't care for, so I can't comment on how it compares.  In summary, my wife and I decreed that this is our new \"go to place!\" You should check it out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Charlotte for her business trip and we went to Dandelion Market for an early anniversary dinner. We had a great time and a nice meal.  We walked in around 5:30 on a Wednesday and were seated right away; the restaurant was maybe 1/4 full. It has a nice ambiance: romantic lighting, brick walls. It's a nice atmosphere for a cozy, romantic dinner.  Their wine list online and on the printed menu at the restaurant is wine by the bottle only, and each bottle is $25. This turned us off from going there for lunch, but it needn't have, since it turned out they had a chalkboard on one wall with a selection of wines by the glass. They also have a good beer selection, including Bell's Two-Hearted, my favorite beer.  We ordered off their dinner menu, which is all tapas (small plates), between about $6 - $12 each. With tapas, we like to order one or two at a time, up to about four total for the two of us. We started with their Artisanal Cheese Board, which came with 3 really nice cheeses, apricot preserves, honeycomb, almond cake/loaf of some sort, and some pita bread wedges. It was a nice enough cheese tray and went well with our Pinot Noir. Our next two tapas were the Shrimp and Grits and Grilled Steak Skewers. The grits were actually two grit cakes, topped with goat cheese--interesting and very nice. The steak skewers were cooked medium rare (there's no choice in the matter) and straight-forward, but very good. We finished the meal with Stuffed Poblano Pepper--stuffed with sausage and cheese, topped with a cream sauce--that was just fantastic. Easily the highlight of the meal. If we went back, I think we'd be tempted to get two of those as an entree.  For dessert, we were told they had had an unexpected run on desserts this week, but were supplementing the 2 house-made desserts they had left with a couple choices from a nearby bakery. We got the Oreo Cheesecake from the bakery, and were not disappointed--they chose bakeries well.  Overall, we had a great, filling romantic dinner--with a bottle of wine--for a pretty great price. Every thing we got was either good or great, and our waitress was great. We were so happy that, when my wife stayed an extra day to finish her trip, she went back for her final dinner in Charlotte. We'll definitely try to make a trip our next time in town."}
{"text":"Unfortunately disappointing food. Ordered take-out from here and should have followed my instinct to trash the entire meal, which reeked of old fryer oil. The calamari was barely edible, fried pickles over-cooked and the source of the old oil smell, and the black bean sliders uninspiring from the slider itself, to the dry flat \"bread\" it was served on and the accompanying bland tomato bland."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to Dandelion for food - I have been several times for drinks at night. My friends and I went to Dandelion Market on March 26th around 11am for brunch. We had a party of about 10 people and a few were running late. There was no wait, but since we couldn't be seated until our entire party arrived, I grabbed a quick soft drink at the bar. This was easily transferred over to my bill once seated.  We were sat upstairs at the long table that is normally hanging from the ceiling at night. I had the quiche of the day, which contained sausage and vegetables, and had fresh fruit on the side. In addition, I ordered a chocolate chip waffle. I thought that the wait for food was a little long, but maybe I was just hungry. Ha! All the food was good and I felt that it was a nice quantity for the price.  I've been to several brunch places in Charlotte and Dandelion is one of the better ones. When I come again I will probably get the Little Italy Omelette. One of my friends ordered it and it looked DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"After reading all of the positive reviews about Dandelion Market on Yelp and seeing it busy every time we walked by the establishment, we finally decided to give it a try this past Saturday night.  Knowing that it's seemingly always busy on weekend nights, I called about a reservation.  Sadly, they didn't take any for parties under 8.  We decided to give it a shot and wait.    We showed up Saturday around 7:30.  I was surprised and happy to see that there was nobody waiting for a table by the hostess stand.  I informed one of the two hostesses there that we wanted a table for two.  She told me it was an hour to and hour and a half wait.  I looked around.  Yes, all of the tables were full...but there was nobody waiting for one either.  She then informed me that there was a bar area upstairs and we could sit up there if we wanted to.  I wasn't aware there was an upstairs at that point, but I was grateful for the additional seating.  We walked upstairs and found another large room with a long bar and a lot of additional tables.  The first thing we both noticed was how incredibly sticky the floor was.  It was like hundreds of sloppy drunk people spilled their drinks and nobody bothered to clean it up.  It reminded both of us of our college days, but that was for the small local bars when you don't care about cleanliness and are just out for a good time.    The bar only had random single seats, no two seats together.  There were two empty tables off to the side in the corner.  They weren't great, had awful lighting, and didn't provide much atmosphere as the rest of the (sticky) room.  Since it was our only option, we decided to sit in one.  Not long after, we were approached by a server informing us that we had to put our name on the waiting list for that table.  Interesting, since the hostess informed us that we could sit \"in the bar area upstairs\" if there were open seats.  And, if these were open tables, why wasn't anybody on the hour-to-an-hour-and-a-half waiting list being seated in them?    Attitudes from both the hostess and a server?  Sticky, unclean floors?  An hour and a half wait for...what?  That was enough for us.  The pretension was astounding.  We walked downstairs, passed three girls at the hostess doing nothing, and proceeded right out the door.  Nobody said anything to us, and they certainly didn't want to hear what I had to say.  Yes, my review is not about the food at the Dandelion Market, but it IS about the cleanliness and customer service, two qualities that I find very important in restaurants, both of which greatly affect my experience...and I thought you should know, too.  I guess Dandelion Market didn't want my money that evening, so I dropped $100 for the two of us elsewhere and we had a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I went back with a large group, and found a completely different restaurant. Actually, it wasn't so much that the restaurant had changed so much as the atmosphere now made sense. It was a Thursday night and we arrived at 7pm - early enough to beat the bar crowd. We were also seated upstairs, where the tables are a little farther from the bar, so that helped with the noise problem. But I think what really helped me was the realization that this is not the place for a quiet dinner; boisterous groups are a much better fit.  Also a plus, a large group means lots of pitchers of beer. That means trying four or five different brews. When a place has 25 beers on tap, you have to step up to the challenge.  There being ten of us, we had just enough to make the one-of-everything-for-$200 work. It made us all feel pretty swanky. Handling that many plates could be quite the ordeal, but with a couple of fun waiters the chaos was enjoyable. Some of the tapas, such as the cheese plate, are easily split amongst 10 people. But some are not. How do you share a house salad? Any ideas? I never saw how that was resolved, because a constant stream of food kept pulling my attention. The amount of food was just what the 10 of us could handle. The one-of-everything selection probably works for 10-12 Maybe 14 if you aren't too hungry. But there is nothing to stop a larger group from ordering the $200 deal and then adding extra plates of their favorites.  In the end, I probably tried two thirds of their plates. Some I loved (artichoke hearts, flatbreads) some I didn't (lamb popsicles) but I'll know for next time. Speaking of next time, I will certainly be back. I'll just know that this is a place best experienced with many many friends."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and food at this place. The boyfriend and I wandered in on a Sunday afternoon in need of snacks and libations. After looking at the menu here, we wondered if he'd be okay in a baseball cap, so we decided to walk by and feel.    The place was pretty empty, so we sidled up to the bar and ordered a pitcher of Abita Triple Haze, a more high-octane version of my favorite summer sipper, Purple Haze. Did I mention this place has an awesome beer selection?   For food, we chose the grilled lamb lollipops with black cherry, greens and feta vinaigrette, along with the proscuitto crostini topped with fig preserves and caramelized onions. Both were great! The lamb was a bit fruity for me (in fact I probably would have preferred it sans cherry), but then I ordered a dish with fruit. The crostini was a really nice balance of sweet, salty and savory. I definitely wanted to come back and try more food here.  Also, the service was super casual and friendly, as were the regulars hanging around. The bf mentioned he's new to town and everyone chimed with suggestions of things to do, good delivery, must-visit restaurants, etc.   In all, this was a great place for afternoon hanging. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I wanted Blue Finn, my friend wanted Pita Pit...Dandelion Market was our happy medium. Before I agreed on this place, I had to scope out the menu. I saw tapas...lots of delicious tapas!   While waiting for my friend to arrive, I decided to try the beer special. A grapefruit wheat beer poured over a simple orange chili syrup. Yummmm. The combination of citrus and heat was refreshing with just the right amount of heat. The waitress informed me that this particular beer was not in stores just yet and they had the exclusive opportunity to showcase it before it was introduced to the public. When my friend arrived, she tasted the beer without the syrup because she doesn't like spice. She enjoyed the beer and we both sipped on this tasty grapefruit beverage as we enjoyed our dinner.  Ok so let's get to the tapas. The menu is broken down into sections by appetizers, surf, turf, etc. Deserts aren't listed because they vary by the day. Here's a list of what we ordered:  fruit and nut salad with poached pears prosciutto crostini  curried turkey meatballs  grilled steak skewers  baked potato croquettes apple pie ravioli with house made vanilla ice cream  Stars for the night were the salad, prosciutto crostini, and the grilled steak skewers. The potato croquets tasted like your standard potato wedge and were lacking in flavor. The curried meatballs won the honorable mention award for flavor and moistness. The waitress did a good job of building up the desert so I was expecting a lot more but ended up with a dish that was basically an apple turnover with ice cream :/. The food didn't add up to her description. She did however do a wonderful job with descriptions for the tapas. I had lots of questions and she successfully answered all of them! There are so many options, perfect for sharing and for trying new dishes each time you visit."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed! Great place to catch up with friends or a date night.   After dinner the upstairs bar/lounge is a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars!!  Finally!! I'm so excited about  Dandelion, I finally have found somewhere in Charlotte that doesn't cost a lot to eat good food!!   We did two rounds of food. We started with the Fried artichokes, Stuffed Zucchini, Prosciutto Crostini, and Beer Cheese!! Everything was great my standout on this round was the Prosciutto Crostini SOOOO good!! Least favorite was the Stuffed Zucchini- not bad, just was ok!  Second round consisted of Pommes Frites, Mussels, Duck Confit flatbread, and Grilled Tiger Prawns. Not as good as our first round but the Mussels and Pommes Frites are AWESOME!! The Prawns were lacking flavor, again not bad but just ok. The Flatbread just didn't do it for me either.   We sat and drank a little but then moved on to the dessert my favorite was the Salted chocolate brownie (FABULOUS) and we had the bread pudding, it didn't stand a chance next to the brownie!!   It's a great space, decor is clean with subtle touches. The bar not huge but a nice cozy space with a tv and plenty of big comfy stools!  I can't wait to come back and try some other things this place is now going to be my new spot for when visitors come and just for EVERYDAY of the week!!"}
{"text":"Brunch was excellent. I had the Carolina Shore omlette  with fruit. Delicious. Waitresses were super friendly and knowledgeable about menu. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars mainly because of the atmosphere. We sat upstairs at this huge wooden table, it was so cool. The lighting is very dim and it was a little loud, but not too bad. I really enjoyed it. The food was good, but not great. My 2 favorite items we tried were the fried pickles and the schezuan green beans. It's a fun place for a group for sure that way you can get several things and share them!"}
{"text":"Came in after Panther game. Scallops were excellent, Mac N Cheese really good, sausage plate really good. Nice little place plenty of character."}
{"text":"Dandelion Market probably makes better margins on their lively nightlife, but this wallflower can't say for sure since bedtime's at 10.  I can, however, speak to their great lunches.    I first experienced their fantabulous ahi tuna salad with a really flavorful citrus vinegarette. My lunchmate raved about the tomato soup and grilled cheese that I tried yesterday and it was classic unhealthy comfort food. I really liked the robust flavor of the soup.  My favorite salad, though, the caprese has been taken off the menu. I don't know if they might bring it back in a future menu. The aged balsamic is so sweet and complemented the generous helping on mozzarella and cherry tomatoes, on top of mixed greens. Yum. Please bring it back!    The Stud had the Rustica which was OK (probably better toasted), but wouldn't recommend it. They did recommend the roast beef.    I've also heard great things about the brunch, but they didn't have the leanest options for brunch, so I bet it would be a good place for a hangover.       The service is always friendly and attentive.  One time I had an issue with the quality of an ingredient and they took care of it swiftly and impressively. The interior  hasn't changed that much since La Torres, but it's got a good vibe, though still feels a bit like a dingy bar. For salads that good, I'll take it."}
{"text":"Came here twice in two days. Don't judge.   While visiting Charlotte for a friend's wedding, my husband stumbled upon Dandelion Market. Went for brunch on Saturday and Sunday, and over that time period had a make-your-own Bloody Mary (mmmm...Tabasco), cinnamon roll (as an appetizer, what else?), biscuits and gravy (so, so, so good... one of my favorite dishes, and one of the best versions of my favorite dishes that I've ever had), and the Monte Cristo (good, no complaints... perfect for a day when I wanted both salty and sweet).   Sunday they can't serve booze until noon, which kind of stunk, since I was going directly to the airport afterward and therefore normal drinking times don't apply.   Cute little hole-in-the-wall feel, and the staff were very friendly and helped us with our luggage the second day... and our large, growing group of rowdy friends on Saturday."}
{"text":"I was at a conference in Charlotte, and came across this joint on restaurant.com. It was a great find. I first thought it was going to be a lady's luncheon place, but it surely was nothing of the sort.   They have tapas and plenty of drinks. The tapas are of good size and are quite good. The prices were also pretty affordable. But this might be me comparing it to LA.  I would say almost 4 out of 5. Like 3.75 out of 5. Wait staff is a 5 out of 5 and same with the ambience. I would definitely go back and would suggest others to try it out for themselves. Good for groups or even just for a couple."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding and the staff is very prompt and friendly.  The lamb popsicles and the sweet potato gnocchi are of special note as is the Mac and cheese.  The beer list is decent as well, just wish they had more porters and stouts (no, Guinness doesn't count)."}
{"text":"A good spot, but a little confused.  Dandelion's apps were very good, the hummus tray was particularly surprising (not something i would typically order at a restaurant, but the flavors were off the charts delicious) Overall the food was good but not stupendous.  In the evening the place is a little confused: is it a restaruant? a pub? a dance club? a rave? depends on the night and the patronage. I tend to like my places a little better defined. But if you are in for a wild card night: go have a beer (good selection on tap) and see where the night takes you."}
{"text":"We came here this morning for brunch with friends.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere, which was quaint. It reminded me of a pub with exposed brick walls, dark wood floors and Palladian windows.    Our waitress was Jasmine and she was very friendly with a sunny disposition.  One of my pet peeves is when I go to a restaurant, order coffee and the server never comes back to refill it.  Jasmine was attentive and brought us more coffee whenever she saw we were running low.  She also didn't rush us out of the restaurant when we were done eating, which was nice as it was the last stop we made before heading home. At the end of the meal she asked us if we had ever come to Dandelion Market for dinner. When we told her we hadn't she told us about what type of food is served and how great it was. She seemed so genuine that it makes me want to come back and try it.  Overall the food was good. They made slight changes to old favorites, which makes breakfast more interesting. The french toast sticks were a little overcooked and the hollandaise sauce on the crab cake benny was a little too lemony but overall we were happy."}
{"text":"When I checked in at the Omni Charlotte on Tuesday evening, the woman at the front desk recommend this bar/restaurant to me. She said it was her favorite wine and tapas spot in Charlotte. She said they had the best Brussel sprouts. So I decided to check it out the following night.  Though I was super hot outside, it was quite cool inside. The Pinot Noir I ordered warmed me up pretty quickly. The folks at the bar were quite friendly and so I engaged in some fun conversations with some like-minded business travelers.   Next I ordered the Brussel sprouts and prosciutto crostini. Though the crostini was fairly good, there was was too much sauce on it for my liking and messy to eat. I love prosciutto so I did finish it. The Brussel sprouts, on the other hand, were delicious and I could have eaten another bowl of it. If I were still hungry, I would have ordered the lamb lollipops. I guess I need to come back...."}
{"text":"I live right down the road from Dandelion Market and I really enjoy it. I know a couple great people who work there as well and I've never had a problem with the service, even on the crazy busier nights.   Dandelion is a great place for a dinner date before hitting the town or with a group of friends for a dinner celebration or just drinks! They get very busy on the weekend nights, though! This place magically turns into almost a club scene with loud music within no time after the dinner crowd starts to retreat. If you would like to check Dandelion Market out, I would suggest you go on a weekend night for a tapas dinner (which is delicious) and then stay a little while after for drinks so you can witness the \"Raising of the Table\" upstairs. The first time I saw it I was impressed by the grandeur of the display. There is a huge, heavy wooden table that is literally raised from the floor to the ceiling after the last party finished from it and right before they put on the music to get the party going! I don't think they have a specific time that they do this but if you ask to eat upstairs, you will eventually see it if you stay long enough afterwards. As soon as that table is raised all the way to the ceiling, it's dancing time!! Yeahhh.  As far as the food goes, it does seem a little pricey for tapas,  but what do you expect from the uptown area? Everything I have ordered there has been delicious such as Lamb lollipops, Potato croquettes, Mac and cheese and much more. Try a little bit of everything and you won't be disapopinted. They also serve breakfast and even though I've only been once, I would definitely go again and recommend it for a non-traditional weekend brunch.   Dandelion also has a great draft beer and wine selection. Their bartenders seem pretty knowledgeable in what they serve so don't hesitate to ask if you are overwhelmed by the choices.  Overall, I enjoy Dandelion Market and find the staff to be super friendly and welcoming. Good eats and a really good time too!"}
{"text":"really cool ambiance a little on the dark side. The food was good and the staff was very friendly. Prices are a little high for what you get but not out of bounds. Great place to meet friends for a pint and some grub."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight- it was so good. The meal was served tapas and the waitress coursed everything thoughtfully so we weren't overwhelmed. We had the peas, gnocchi, lamb medallions, sprouts, brownie, lasagna and caprese- it was so goood and less than 70 with two beers!   I didn't like the Brussel sprouts, they were sad and lifeless the waitress, Katie I believe was so good, incredibly passionate about the menu and very fun to have her serve us. I will return"}
{"text":"Went to Dandelion last night on a Sunday evening.  Ordered the calamari, chicken wings, lamb lollipops, scallops, grilled prawns and the ribs.  All were pretty great.  My favorites were the calamari, scallops and ribs.  For the price the food was exceptional.  Our waitress was very friendly and seemed to be holding the whole forte down including hostessing.  She still was very attentive.  Food came out fast and hot.  Also, they have several bottles of wine for $25 each and if you don't finish it you can take it to go!!  \"Nuff said!!  Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Huge apology to our waitress, as I forget her name and she deserves a shout out. She was wonderful, gave honest recommendations and knew the menu very well. Seemed genuinely excited to be serving us, which having worked in the industry I doubt highly was the case, but she sold the heck out of it. Really, really great.  It's a nice stop. Sharing is what you'll be doing here, so know that going in. The lamb was for me overcooked but flavor was still otherwise where you want it, other handful we tried they nailed it. The calamari, which is a throwaway so many places, was perfect. Well done stuff. That in particular impressed me, it's so easy to do but so bad 90% of places. It proved they care.  It's not the peak of the mountain, but it has a nice concept, nice people, and overall quite good food. I don't live in Charlotte and won't be back there without a pistol held to my temple, but if you're there, this is a cute place to spend two hours or so. If I was there it'd certainly get a second visit, probably much more.  It was only the two of us, they don't do reservations for smaller than eight. If you got a large group from what I scouted it's an excellent choice, made for it even."}
{"text":"It looked like there was some seating upstairs but we were seated in the bar area which was pretty loud even on a Tuesday night owing to all of the hard surfaces in the room.   Sitting in a noisy bar had two effects on my experience: it made me want to pay pub prices for the food and it made me expect really good drinks.   The food was pretty good overall, but some things were better than others. The seared tuna and short rib were excellent, the sweet potato gnocchi good, and the brussels sprouts and prosciutto crostini were just OK. The sprouts were soggy rather than crispy roasted and the crostini had way too much balsamic on them. The brownie and ice cream dessert may have been the highlight of the meal.  $65 for those 6 dishes would have been reasonable and probably 4 starts from me, but factoring in the $30+ we spent on 3 mediocre cocktails drove the rating down. The cocktail menu looked good on paper so we passed up the $15/bottle Tuesday night wine special. That was a mistake. I had the \"Hot Blooded\" which was supposed to be a Bulleit Bourbon based cocktail, but I could hardly taste it. It was also served in a highball glass loaded to the top with ice, so I had to drink it quickly before the ice melted and diluted the drink even more. Not worth $12. When one of the hostesses came by to bus our dishes, she said how much she liked the drink, and I said it could use more bourbon. Rather than taking this as constructive criticism, she said, \"Oh, there's plenty of bourbon in there.\" I beg to differ.   The service was hit and miss. Our server (didn't catch her name) was great and very enthusiastic. Someone from the kitchen ran the food out and had the annoying tendency of letting go of the plates rather than setting them down. He was also inattentive to where on the table he was setting the plates, so it had the effect of slamming the plates down anywhere he could find a place.  Not sure the bar is good enough or the food consistent enough to warrant another visit to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday afternoon.  Relatively busy but the seating was quick.  There are two window seats so if you are lucky enough to get one you will really feel as if you have found a cool urban hideaway.   The server was fast and friendly with both drink and food orders.  The have  a good selection of craft beers including a number of North Carolina brews.  My wife had a Bellini and said that it tasted very fresh.   Shortly after our server greeted us, she returned with a basket of biscuits and jams.  Watch out, the jams are so yummy that you will spoil your lunch by eating it all.  We both ordered something off of the brunch menu and I added some fries.  The fries were so hot when the arrive that we had to wait a bit to taste them.  The remainder of the food arrived hot as well and was very tasty.  We didn't feel rushed and enjoyed our meal.  I had a Winter Fashion which is a winter version of an Old Fashion for dessert and it was very nice indead.  Overall a very good find."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  Yeah, I get that a few places have crazy good inventive bartenders that grow and blend their own ingredients, thus justifying ridiculous cocktail prices.  This isn't one of those places, and the cocktails aren't terribly special...but they are priced as if they are.  Beer menu isn't terribly varied, wanted a stout I hadn't had before, ended up with a NoDa porter I've had 100 times.  It's good, just wanted something new.  Waiter didn't understand beer styles, so he was useless.  No, I do not want a black lager as a substitute, thank you.  Tapas, huh?  What this means is full price for half of a plate with no sides.  My beef skewers were fantastic, but they were pretty small.  Sure glad I got to fill up on fries (not).  I'm not normally overly sensitive, but where we were sitting had an incredible odor of mold, that sure didn't help.  I'll give it another shot and update accordingly depending on how it goes."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time this past week. Food is solid on both flavor and portions. We sampled pomegranate glazed scallops and a sausage stuffed poblano. Both were excellent. Also tried the mozzarella and basil flatbread. Flavor fell a little flat- absolutely no pun intended. Look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Caveat: This reviews is for 5pm on a weekday, not 10pm on a weeknight, which I hear is totally different and more like a party.  At 5pm this place is exactly what I want a bar to be. Andrew, the bartender, was friendly and knowledgeable to a couple of out of towners.  The beer selection here is wonderful, if not very large. They have a bunch of local stuff which is what I want to try when I'm visiting a new city. I found the prices to be spot on as well.   If you're in this area and it's not too late, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese sandwich is to die for - and from the amount of cheese, that may be literally what will happen.  Went for lunch, and everyone enjoyed what they had - but those with the grilled cheese were in absolute heaven.  I also had the chicken salad sandwich one day and that was incredible as well.  Can't say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"I think I'm becoming a small plates addict.  Had dinner at yet ANOTHER tapas like restaurant, this time in Charlotte, and left pleased once again.  I think the world REALLY needs more small plates venues, it would make for smilier, happier people, seriously!  At Dandelion Market, the atmosphere is pub like with dim lighting, a big screen tv, and a rustic feel.  It screams, come in, have a drink & some hearty food, and relax.  We got a table right by the window and midway through our dinner it started to downpour, with strong bouts of lightening.  With candles on every table, exposed brick, the rain beating hard by the window, and just the all around coziness of the place, we couldn't have picked a better spot to be at.  As for the food, really loved just about everything we ordered.  The mac and cheese was a pleasant surprise made with corkscrew noodles instead of the standard bent noodles and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The bread crumbs on the top melted nicely throughout the dish.  Our santa fe corn plate was a mouthful of zesty flavor with just the right amount of tangy kick.  My favorite though was hands down the roasted red pepper and artichoke dip, so creamy and yummy, and incredibly perfect with the warm soft yet slightly crispy pita slices.  Due to the downpour, we decided to stick around in the restaurant a bit longer and with nothing else to do, we ordered dessert (yeah, it was a tough call!) and I have to say their bread pudding totally rocked.  It was slightly different than most bread puddings I've had which are generally soft, gooey, and blended with carmel, but at Dandelion, it was more like soft sweetened toast with ice cream, which doesn't sound very good, but actually tasted pretty amazing.  Their menu is vegetarian friendly (all three of us who went are veggies) and their prices are super reasonable too.  We ordered a tea, four small plates and two desserts and our bill came out to under $45!  Pretty sweet deal :)  If you're in the neighborhood, this place is definitely worth giving a try!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in uptown! Salads are always great, sandwiches are decadent, and soup is hearty and warms your soul.   This place is the opposite of handicapped friendly, if that's a concern for you. There is a step to enter from the street, and then a few steps to conquer once you get inside. If you have mobility issues, you might want to consider going elsewhere, though their staff is very helpful if you need a hand getting up the stairs with your crutches or walker."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! I love the Southern Caprese and the Gingerbread Martini! Actually I love everything I have tried here! I want to go for brunch! Love getting a seat by the window too. Cool atmosphere and good service!"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices for dinner and brunch! Good drinks and some dancing at night upstairs!"}
{"text":"great tapas. love the ahi tuna. everything is delish.  great place to hang out with friends or take a date"}
{"text":"I like the gastropub look and feel, but honestly the menu had too many fried items for my taste. The quality was good - but I think it could be healthier.   Our waitress was super sweet and I still have to go back and check out the upstairs, but I'n not sure I would have dinner there again. I give em 2 starts because the hype lead me to believe it would be 4.  Keepin it real."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I got very good service from everyone from the hostess, to the waitress, to the busboys.  Interesting layout, and a nice space.  I had the Fig bourbon cocktail (which was fair).  I would suggest sticking with beer or wine here.  They offer small plates which are reasonably priced.  I had the Mac n Cheese which was very good.  The Lamb Pops which were delicious - especially the cherry glaze. And the Gnocchi- also very good.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the small plate idea as you get to try more menu options. Our waiter wasn't the most knowledgeable about wine but he did ask another person in order to help us chose a bottle. My wife and I tried two apps and two entrees. We did a order of their sweet and spicy green beans. They were good, I thought more sweet than spicy. The Calamari our waiter recommend and he was right they did have a good crisp and flavor. They are only the ring so if your a tentacle fan you will have to fine somewhere else.   The entrees we chose the Lamb and the scallops. The scallops had a great sear on them. It is a fine line of a good sear and over cooked and they played it perfectly. The lamp was a perfect rare temp (which my wife prefers. I am more of a Med-rare.) My wife got an order of the sweet potatoes which I do not like however they tasted more like pumpkin so I didn't mind them. I ordered the Croquettes after the waiter said the Mac & Cheese is inconsistent. They were good but only came with four. Overall I was satisfied and would go back again."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after always being told to check it out. Went for Sunday brunch. The food was excellent as well as my mimosa. However, the service was kind of slow and our waitress wasn't very attentive."}
{"text":"I need to preface this review by saying we only got to experience Dandelion Market on an early Monday afternoon.  My husband and I were the only 2 patrons in the place.  We grabbed seats at the bar and partook in a couple beers.  The hubby was super excited to visit this place because they have $3 pints on Mondays.  The beer menu was decent with around 20 beers available on draft.  Unfortunately they were all out of my first 2 choices of seasonal beer so I went with the trusty standby, OMB Mecktoberfest.    Our visit here was relaxing and comfortable.  The atmosphere of the downstairs area is really cozy.  Our bartender was very friendly and we chatted with him for a bit.  We were excited to hear they have live music during the weeknights that sets up downstairs.  Although we didn't get to try any of their food and I hear it gets busy late at night (especially on weekends), this is a very promising place to chill out in the late afternoon/early evening.  I imagine this could become our new Monday night spot due to the $3 pints.  I'll have to amend this review after trying their food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this is review is for the restaurant....not the clubby weirdness that this place turns into late night on the weekends.  With that said, this is by far our favorite restaurant in Charlotte. American style small plates and literally everything on the menu is delicious. Cherry. Glazed. Lamb. Lollipops. Write that down. Also the sweet potato gnocchi is always a huge hit when we bring people there and we end up getting 2-3 orders of it. This place is quaint enough for a date night with just your significant other, but even better when you go with groups that are larger. You can try more things that way.   There is also a bartender here, I forget his name. I've only seen him at the downstairs bar, and he's Irish, but he makes the best Old Fashioned in Charlotte. Well, besides me!"}
{"text":"Severe food poisoning and a hospital visit that is going to cost at least $300+....thanks Dandelion Market.  Folks please don't go to this place.  They obviously have no health standards."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour to meet a girlfriend and great place to get a few drinks and appetizers and not too crowded upstairs, but enough of a scene to make you feel like you are out and about.  The goat cheese bruschetta was ON POINT!"}
{"text":"Cornbread was like sawdust, burger was ice cold in the middle, calamari gave me food poisoning and Max and cheese was bland. So expensive for such a horrible experience. Never going back here."}
{"text":"I can't believe how long it took for me to check out Dandelion Market! That all changed this past Saturday night, though.  I had some friends in town & we wanted to eat before heading to the Bobcats game.  It was busy for a Saturday, even at 6 PM. We were able to grab a table upstairs, big enough for the 6 of us.  We had a really nice waitress, who was gracious enough to help us out with our time constraint (the game started at 7 PM).  One of my friend's & I decided to share our meal...we got the mac 'n cheese, meatballs, tuna, wings, fried pickles, & the southern caprise salad. Everything we had was perfect & had an interesting spin. My favorite would have to be the fried pickles. The lightly battered pickles were spicy & delicious. The mac 'n cheese was my second favorite, even though they used the spiral noodles. It was creamy!   The layout is pretty spacious & can accommodate big groups - there was a huge birthday party going on i(n the more open space) & we didn't feel crampt.  The menu - food & drinks - is really expansive, so you're sure to find plenty of things to suit your palate. Prices are reasonable, as well.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was very nice. It had a darker Irish bar feeling to it, but minus the bad smell :). The drinks were good, staff friendly.   I had the shrimp and grits first , amazing dish if you're fond of goat cheese entrees. Then had the lamp pops.... Also great. Finished up with the Mac and cheese. It was also good! I would recommend this place. Nice work"}
{"text":"Food was delicious & bartenders were awesome! Was getting busy but everyone behind the bar was so helpful! Helping pick drinks & advising on favorite dishes.  Can't wait to go again! Calamari & sliders were delicious. My group enjoyed their meals as well. Mac n cheese was good, lamb lollipops, awesome portion of fries - great for the entire table."}
{"text":"I came here with a few coworkers for lunch, and was very impressed. We were seated on the second floor which was spacious and had an amazing atmosphere.  The dining space reminded me of a combination old west and a medieval festival in Europe. You can see old horse carriage wheels hung on the walls, some wooden barrels, and a knight armor in the corner. Pretty cool!   For lunch, I had a parmesan chicken salad sandwich which used a French croissant instead of bread. It was amazing and very fresh. Also their French fries were delicious with very crispy batter!   I can wait to be back here on a Friday or Saturday night, I heard the first floor is a pub-type bar, and the second floor turns into a club with live DJ.   I will keep you posted!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference and stayed at the Omni. Asked a bartender there for good local spots to eat. Without skipping a beat he immediately recommended Magnolia Grill. The next day (Sat, Feb 17) we went there for lunch. We were immediately greeted with smiles and salutations. We got seats right away. The waitress was extremely helpful offering suggestions and her thoughts on the menu as well as local beers. I had the Prosciutto Benny, and my wife had the Capreese Benny and got a side of the bacon cornbread. Everything was absolutely great. When they delivered our food I didn't receive my hash browns. I saw the person beside me had some with his Benny and presumed they came with the meal. I saw the manager walking buy and I inquired about the hash browns. She clarified that my meal didn't come with them, and I apologized for my mistake. She brought me and comped the hash browns even though it was my fault! Tremendous customer service! Definitely go!"}
{"text":"Came by for drinks and I was happy w selection of beers on tap and cocktails. Kitchen wasn't open yet. They were just putting away the bloody Mary bar so if you fancy those, it seemed like a nice setup. Customer service was good. I would recommend this place as a pit stop in the area."}
{"text":"I came for dinner with a group of friends and managed to order 10 dishes split between four people.  Suffice it to say, that's probably more than normal quartets would order, but I was in the group and I love to eat! :)  We ordered the Baked Potato Croquettes, Prosciutto Crostini, Grilled Lamb Lollipops, Dando Ribs, Sausage Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Sautéed Wild Mushrooms, Market Mac & Cheese, Sweet & Spicy Green Beans, Butter Sautéed Sea Scallops, and the Dando Crab Cakes.  Overall, the dishes were pretty great, but there were a couple of I'm-definitely-getting-these-next-time plates that are worth a special mention.  The Prosciutto Crostini, Dando Ribs, and Sweet & Spicy Green Beans are must-haves. The Baked Potato Croquettes were tasty, but don't have the same punch to the taste buds as the other three I mentioned. The Sautéed Wild Mushrooms were great, but very, very salty/creamy/rich and are best evenly shared between multiple people so you don't get too overwhelmed by the strength of the sauce.  I had high hopes for the Grilled Lamb Lollipops and the Butter Sautéed Sea Scallops, but found them to be very forgettable.  I'm not a fan of sausage, but had a taste of the pepper shell of the Sausage Stuffed Poblano Pepper and it definitely had a spicy kick that was nice."}
{"text":"had the baked potato croquettes (really good, but probably not worth the cost for only 4), artichoke dip (very filling), sweet potato gnocchi (amazing), mussels (large portion size), car bomb cupcake (delicious, even to somebody that doesn't like a lot of chocolate), mint chocolate chip cheesecake (small, but delectable), mint chocolate martini (yum!) overall more than we would normally spend for dinner, but perfect for a special night out.  great atmosphere and servers. would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a coworker, and thoroughly enjoy ourselves.  Atmosphere is right up my alley - upscale without being pretentious, some worn surfaces here and there, and coolly casual.  Food was creative, fresh, and flavorful - I had the grilled cheese with tomato and prosciutto, which was crunchy, chewy, sweet, and salty.  Can't wait to go back and try the dinner menu and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a good friend and they were right. I loved it! Everything we got was fantastic! Small plate everything!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. The best grilled cheese in charlotte. Love the tapas menu and the tea options.  Very low key style and priced to please. Good lunch for around ten bucks and great service.   Note: I recently emailed them about an incident I read about online and they replied with a very satisfactory statement and explanation."}
{"text":"Named for a Dublin landmark of the 1970s, Dandelion Market does little to evoke its Celtic lineage, but it is nevertheless a comfortable spot to grab a bite to eat. The dimly lit brick-walled interior, with its chalkboard specials and dried goods sacks on the walls, is the definition of cozy and quaint. The small plates dinner menu offers everything from appetizers to surf and turf to veggies and sides with a variety of culinary influences, leaving you free to cobble together a flavorful Frankenstein of a meal.  My wife and I rolled the dice with a spinach and artichoke dip, a fried green tomato caprese, a shrimp and grit cake, and a pork belly with a brownie-and-caramel-topped-ice cream combo for dessert. Some dishes were stronger than others, but the food was generally on-point. Dandelion Market does sauces very well, as both the fig balsamic accompanying the tomato and the peach-green tomato salsa accompanying the pork belly were excellent. The pork belly had a melt-in-your-mouth quality that I appreciated though my wife found it too fatty for her tastes. The bread that came with the dip was oven-fresh, and the ice cream betwixt the brownies offered some welcome vanilla bean notes that played well off of the salted caramel.  As with any tapas place, pricing can be a bit slippery. Most plates run $7-$12. Count on at least two per person, and it adds up. The skillful execution and artful plating take away some of the sting, and the efficient kitchen and attentive servers ensure you won't have long to wait between plates.  With an appealing menu, an inviting atmosphere, and a front-of-house and kitchen that both seem to know what they are doing, Dandelion Market has all the components needed to deliver a memorably good meal."}
{"text":"Man. I have eaten here twice and haven't been disappointed. We usually try to come here before a show at the filmore because it is so close and we get sick of the restaurants right by the venue! This time around we got the meat and cheese plate which had a lemon pistachio salami on it (omg-I want more), cherry lamb lollipops, deviled eggs, porkbelly (holy moly this was the best! Crispy, crunchy, sweet and savory), and potato croquettes. We also tried a salty dog and the mucho gusto cocktail. No complaints and a super cute place! Go!"}
{"text":"We just got the hummus tapas plate, but it was tasty! And they brought us extra pita slices when we ran out! Overall, I just loved the vibe of this place. You could be out in the main part or tucked back into a corner where you can watch the people around."}
{"text":"Omg this place .....we ate and ate and ate  Honestly the non veg items were much better than the veg ones... So here is what we ordered and I will rate them on 5  1. Veg rolls 2/5 2. Flatbread 2/5 3. Artichoke dip 4/5 ( I dint like the fried chips) 4. Black bean sliders 5/5 5. Hummus platter 3/5 6. Turkey meatballs 4/5 7. Lamp chops 5/5 7. Veg pasta ( was more like sautéed veggies) 3/5"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance! Ordered the chicken salad sandwich or whatever. The bread was delish! Salad dressing was so-so. My friend ordered the house kettle chips as a side though, and those were great. Overall a tasty meal and very cool atmosphere. Would love to return for dinner and tapas one day."}
{"text":"While we've only been for drinks, it's a great atmosphere, nice drink menu and fun music. Good happy hour or late night spot!"}
{"text":"Tuesday nights are wine nights! Great bartenders + great friends = my favorite memories"}
{"text":"First time visit.  Waitress very full of menu details and readily shared. Couples nite out. Shared nice reisling wine. Red pepper artichoke dip with warm and toasted pita bread. Ahi Tuna-the BOMB!  Ummmmmm.  Beautiful presentation. Delicious. Cucumber slices and tasty sauces.  Downer was poblano stuffed pepper. Meh. Sausage mashed into it. 1/3 of it was charred.  Not flavorful.  Acoustics terrible. Big open brick wall room. People kept talking louder to hear each other. Loudness grew and grew. Effects of beer & wine added to it.   There is a room upstairs for dining & clubbing. DJ up spiral staircase. Large open room with bar on 2 walls. Couple booths and barstools. According to people we talked to suppose to be a happening place friday & saturday nites.  Have fun my friends..."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty decent beer selection in Uptown Charlotte.  I have never eaten here, but have sat at the bar to drink beers a few times.  The staff is always friendly, but the prices are a little high."}
{"text":"I don't think I've gotten the full Dandelion Market experience yet. It's a restaurant that later turns into a bar/club. Haven't eaten there yet, just went one night for drinks and ended up staying to dance. One of the better dance spots in Charlotte. Does get a bit loud though."}
{"text":"I actually visited The Dandelion Market twice for their brunch menu while in Charlotte for a friend's wedding,. The first time was with some friends who were also attending the wedding--one couple had actually been there the day before and raved about it. I had the Monte Cristo and had to restrain myself from inhaling the whole thing in 5 minutes: it was crispy, soft, sweet, salty--everything you could want in a brunch sandwich. And if that isn't enough, it comes with raspberry preserves AND maple syrup (and you'll want to test both out, believe me). From what I heard, everyone else enjoyed their meals as well.  The next day, I met my mom, aunt, grandmother, and my mom's best friend in Charlotte and I guess my description of The Dandelion Market was so tantalizing that they wanted to try it as well. Everyone at the table got the Monte Cristo except for me; I opted for a set of small plates: a Cinnamon Roll, Scrambled Eggs, and Bacon (had to try something new!). Everyone loved the Monte Cristo (which made me happy).  The service was pretty good; it was a bit slow at times, but overall, the staff was courteous. The space was very open, giving me the sense that the restaurant is pretty active bar venue, but the lighting was very dark, especially for a morning spot. Nonetheless, I'll be sure to stop by The Dandelion Market the next time I'm in downtown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The fried beet falafel was by far the best falafel I had ever tasted. Grilled chicken wings were also delicious. I wasn't really sure if we had a designated waitress, as two different servers kept checking in with us. Both servers were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Food was incredible and service was great. It was a little loud because it was Friday night but I guess that's to be expected. The food made up for it. Will definitely come back if we ever are in town again."}
{"text":"I attended an after work event here a few days ago.  It was my first time visiting so I was pretty excited since they were on my list to try.  The appetizers included mac n cheese, hummus, meat and cheese, potato croquettes, bruschetta and a few other apps that were simply not memorable. I did enjoy the blueberry peach mule, it was flavorful and light.  Although I wasn't impressed on this visit, I do plan to return to try brunch ."}
{"text":"I tried Dandelion Market my first visit to Charlotte. When I moved here it was a place that I could not wait to try again. I have yet to eat something I didn't like. This is a great place to check out with one person you are close with. From what I can tell, the dishes usually have two servings. Great for sharing..... if you aren't in a large group. The atmosphere is a little odd. There is dim lighting the made me think \"fancy\" but the back of the dining room is \"sports bar.\" But with great food and a great beer selection, that didn't bother me."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California and I have met so many people by just walking around the city. They are always eager to answer any questions that I might have and I almost always ask, \"What restaurants would you recommend?\" I have Avery from Bank of America to thank for this recommendation :)  We came here on a Thursday evening, right after the bf got off of work. The hostess was welcoming as she led us to a seating area upstairs. The dim lighting and wood floors reminded me of a pub/tavern. Jerod, our waiter, explained to us that all the food items were tapas, which was perfect for us since we didn't want to eat too heavy. He said four dishes would be sufficient for the both of us. He recommended the black bean sliders and the green beans. I chose the pan seared ahi tuna ($12) and the black bean sliders ($8). He chose the butter sautéed sea scallops ($13) and the steamed mussels ($13).   The ahi came out first and I have to admit that I was a bit surprised at the presentation. Even though this place received great reviews on yelp, I guess I was expecting pub-looking food. I was mucho HAPPY with the presentation! Of course, the way that it tastes is more important, but hey! What can I say? I am a sucker for pretty food! There were about seven pieces of deliciousness with wasabi aoli, sweet chili sauce, and sesame soy perfectly presented on the plate.   Just as we polished off the ahi, the remaining parade of food came out of the kitchen. The black bean sliders tasted just as good as they looked. They were so cute! When we ordered, I could tell my bf wasn't too enthused with my choice on the sliders, but we were both fans after we ate them. The creamy texture of the guacamole and the green grilled tomato were a nice contrast to tasty black bean patty. I could see this dish being satisfying as a meal if they served it in a regular sized portion. The mussels were wading in a shallow plate of white wine, garlic, cream, and bacon and came with four pieces of crostini for dipping in the leftover sauce. I only wish the mussels came in a bowl so there would be more sauce! :p The scallops were good but, nonetheless, my least favorite. There were two very large scallops nestled next to a small bed of arugula. But I think the pomegranate drizzle was a little too sweet for me.   By the time we finished, the tables started to fill up around us and the noise level had gone up a notch. We hardly noticed though because we were so enamored with our meal. The portions were perfect, the quality of food surpassed my expectations, and the service was excellent. Although we got drenched walking in the rain on the way home, it was so worth it. I'll be adding Dandelion Market to my growing list of restaurants to revisit while staying in Uptown."}
{"text":"Awesome place for small plates in uptown Charlotte. The mussels and the chorizo stuffed poblano are the stars of the show. Nice wine list and cocktails list as well. Friendly staff. A must visit while in CLT."}
{"text":"I've never had the food but a super fun place to hang on Friday of Saturday nights. They raise the large table upstairs and DJ plays great music. Always a good diverse crowd- fun dancing to awesome music! The bartenders are usually quick and fun and take excellent care of customers. One of my favorite spots to hang out!"}
{"text":"Good Food, but I wish they had the sandwiches available for dinner.  The Mac and Cheese was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  Also the atpmospher was excellent, they really do a great job of giving it that old english world charm.  The only thing I would hold back on is the bean sliders.  They were good, but a real meat slider or  a pot pie would be perfect for this place. overall great service and a great atmospher!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was able to accommodate my gluten intolerance by replacing bread with crackers and sliced cucumbers. Not a ton of options but everything I ate was delicious... now if only they could buy some gluten free bacon for the Brussels sprouts! (Hint hint)"}
{"text":"I'm always in the mood for tapas, and Dandelion hits the spot! It's suggested that you order 2-3 plates per person, and we found that 2 was completely sufficient!   -Deviled Eggs: skip. The filling is less deviled eggy, and more like a pine nut hummus, at least on the day we went.   -Fried Pickles: GET! A huge order of sinful goodness with the perfect horseradish mayo accompaniment.   -Prosciutto Crostini: GET! Four crispy breads with goat cheese, fig spread, prosciutto and balsamic. Superb.   -BBQ Short Rib: may order again. It was VERY rich, and after an already full dinner, we couldn't finish it.  I would gladly return! This hit the spot and was a total winner, and there were a few other tapas I was highly interested in ordering!"}
{"text":"Dandelion Market is another place that I have just been to for drinks but need to still try for dinner! So, this is another review that is just for drinks and my experience.   Visit 1: Went upstairs to drink and shake it on the dance floor (at night Dandelion Market plays music and has a dance floor upstairs) Visit 2: Went upstairs to grab a drink while barhopping with friends, it was early so they were not playing music yet. We ordered the shot special which was a delicious Lemon Pound Cake shot!   Service at the bar is always quick and fantastic. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Was here twice in my 3 days in Charlotte - seemed the least offensive non-chain in the Epicenter area, why risk it, right?  Had drinks & dinner on Friday & partook in the Bloody Mary bar on Sunday.  All was a contrast in clientele.  Friday night downstairs bar was casual, relaxed, friendly service. Great craft beer selection was so cheap I kept insisting on paying.  I tend to do this every weekend I leave NY & get shocked all over again that a beer can be had for $5.  Amazing.  Anyway, didn't even realize there was more than the first floor till we were taken up for dinner.  Space turned into a bumpin-club-type-thing, replete with the ceremonial raising of a huge banquet table to make room for the band/revelers.  At that point it was super loud & packed, but our night was coming to an end, so no matter.  Food was mediocre at best, but completely fit the bill of greasy snacks to soak up the booze.  Basically they just deep fry every protein, veg or dairy product you could want.  The artichokes might even have been canned. all good, I ate those little suckers anyway.  Calamari, some type of non-bun burger deal & the flatbread should generally be avoided.    Sunday was also successful,  Quietly caught the end of the Bears game & had much fun mixing our Bloody's.  Cheers to the bartender with the heavy hand and for all-around general friendliness."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised by the positive reviews of the place. Is there no better food in Charlotte?? My spidey senses turned on when I arrived at the door and noticed the decor mimicked a British pub, but they serve \"American tapas.\" Alas, I still opened the door and took a seat at the bar, so the rest is on me. I've had many better meals in airports. It gets more than one star because The bartender was really sweet."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by this place on a trip out to Charlotte because of their extensive small plate offerings.  I love trying a bunch of different things, so small plates are always very appealing to me.  I just didn't realize this place was a Irish Pub until I went there.  Maybe it's just me, but a Irish Pub is one of last places I'd expect to encounter small plates/tapas fare.  For me that just makes this establishment all that much more appealing, because I always love unique places.  Well the food is exceptional here, and Ireland is, after all, one of my ancestral homelands, so how could I not like this place.         Dandelion Market is right off Tryon on 5th St. and well within walking distance to most uptown destinations.  I'd had my heart set on the Fried Calamari, the Southern Caprese and the Fried Pickles, cause pickles are just awesome and frying them, just like anything else, makes them all that much better.  The Southern Caprese is just pure genius.  I love fried green tomatoes and Caprese salads, so I figured how could this not be amazing...well it definitely is.  The salty sour fried green tomatoes end up being a great contrast against the rich fresh mozzarella, but the fig balsamic dressing seals the deal on this one.  It's has just the right amount of sweetness and combined with the micro greens they tie the whole dish together in perfect balance.  Don't expect it to be at all like a traditional Caprese salad, as the fried green tomatoes and lack of basil take the dish in a whole new direction.  As for the Fried Calamari, seriously no lie, it was the absolute best fried calamari I have ever had in my whole life.  The calamari was cooked perfectly, and that is no small feat.  I could bite through it effortlessly, I mean it didn't even have the slightest inkling of chewiness to it.  The calamari itself had great flavor and the lemon garlic aioli and grilled lemon just made it even more incredible.  I still can't believe how good it was, and would tell people to go here specifically just to try it.  The fried pickles were just so so, and I probably wouldn't order again.  All I got out of them was a super crispy ubiquitous fried flavor that was lacking the sour briny taste I love about fried pickles.  The horseradish aioli was delicious, and was the saving grace for this dish for sure.      Overall this place is a solid 4.5 stars.  The food and atmosphere are well worth a visit, and the service is just phenomenal.  Anytime I needed or wanted anything, someone was all over it before I knew what hit me.  The restaurant space itself is pretty amazing in itself.  You can tell the whole place originates from days long past.  The space has a very classic vintage feel that just can't be duplicated from scratch now a days.  This is definitely a special place and is absolutely one of my go to spots in Charlotte now."}
{"text":"I'm completely shocked when I walk into this place and compared that to the pretty plated foods. Reading the previous reviews, it does look like a pub of some sort but the foods offered comes out soo pretty.  I had to sent back their cucumber mint mojitos. Since its 4pm in the afternoon, and being my 1st for the day. I figure I'll stick with the more water down mojitos. They do liquor up their drinks. I was buzz half way thru.  My friend Tiff ordered the burger sliders, red pepper/artichoke dip and the Brussels spouts. I ordered the baked potato croquettes and the grilled chicken wings.  The red pepper/-artichoke dip is a little salty for me. The crispy pita are very good tho. The Brussels spouts are delicious. I'm getting that agin next time. The baked potato croquettes are a little bland. You definitely need the scallion cream that comes with it. The grilled chicken wings are bad ass. I can definitely taste the chipotle brown sugar rub. Finish with the ranch dipping sauce provided.  Amanda our waitress/bartender are the sweetest thing.. She's tentative, laugh at our jokes even tho it's not that funny and she's on point.. I have to get over the decor because it look a little gloomy that day I came in but I can definitely overcome that when the food are pretty, good and customer service are great."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for tapas. I can say I liked almost everything, but the prosciutto crostini with goat cheese and the short rib with polenta are both amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the stuffed poblano pepper because it was served in a pool of grease, but when the server noticed it was barely eaten and asked how it was I just casually mentioned it was a little too greasy (not at all in a complaining way) and she said she would take it off the bill. Very good customer service! On Tuesday's they have $15 bottles of wine so that's a nice little perk. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere inside. The food (small bites and things to share) were really good. Especially the shrimp and grits. Really flavorful and delicious.   The place is overall quite loud, so just be prepared. But really liked it."}
{"text":"NOOM... NOOM! DELICIOUS!  Such laid back, chill atmosphere and wonderful service! We had the skillet breakfast(s) and they were fantastic!  Wonderful friendly service and a really neat Irish background. I would suggest this place if you are looking for a pub feel with friends, or a nice little nook to be on your computer."}
{"text":"Welcome to Uptown, Dandelion! We went out with a couple friends to try out the newest addition to Uptown.  The interior is warm and inviting, making it easy to sit down and let the day roll off your back. They have great wall art when you walk in and the bathrooms have a fun, vintage feel.   They have a large selection of wines and beers...and a delicious caramel ice cream with a shot of Maker's Mark. We ordered the mussels (plump and yummy), mac and cheese, and portobello mushrooms (with a special dipping sauce). Apparently they had a very busy night and were out of half of their menu.  The service was great! Very attentive, yet not intruding. The crowd created a nice blend of chill and happy.   Great times, didn't break the bank, and fantastic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I went on a Wednesday night and it was very relaxed and everyone was very friendly. We split a bottle of wine that the bartender suggested and it was delicious. I would definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"I came to bar hop on a Sat night. Drinks are reasonably priced, fun atmosphere especially at the upstairs bar/dance floor. They had NCAA games on small TVs. I'd recommend going to this bar."}
{"text":"We only had time for one dinner in Charlotte and decided on Dandelion Market, as it was close to our hotel and, unfortunately for us, it was pouring the night we went!  We ordered a variety of tapas:  spinach & goat cheese salad (good, but one small sliver of goat cheese?), calamari (it was just OK), ribs (very good), brussel sprouts (really good), shrimp and grits (very good) and the beef sliders (excellent).  I would put the sprouts and sliders at the top of the list.  Ordered a bottle of cabernet.  I realize I shouldn't complain, as all their bottles are only $25, but the wine was just OK...I think it was called The Show & we found it to be a bit on the sweet side.  For dessert we split a brownie w/caramel & ice cream, which was decent, but I wouldn't run back for it.  Would def. try a different dessert in the future.  Overall, a really nice experience in a pretty cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to Dandelion Market when it first opened and was incredibly packed. I was happy to try it again on a recent Monday night when it was much calmer, but by no means dead. The space is really nice and quaint inside, but what really impressed me was the service--from the people greeting me at the door to our very personable waiter, the service was really spot-on. I was also a bit sheepish bringing my 9-month old with me, as this place doesn't strike me as very baby-friendly, but the staff were very accommodating and immediately found a high chair for her.   Of the tapas plates we tried, the best were the sliders and the shrimp and grits. My friends got the mussels, and they looked amazing. The stuffed zucchini was good, but not a stand-out. DM had a great beer special Monday night--$3 pints--which most of my party enjoyed, and everyone seemed impressed with the beer list. For a nice afterwork dinner, this place is really top-notch."}
{"text":"I'm an easy mark for laid-back spots with solid beer selections, and Dandelion Market features both: lots of NC brews represented within, and this place was a welcome respite from a day that saw the Charlotte area awash in temperamental weather. Fortunately I had the good sense to come in out of the rain for once.  Dandelion makes an interesting first impression: the wall to your immediate right boasts a wall of shoe trees -- enough of them that I asked the bartender if there was some significance to the art installation. Nope, he said, they were pretty much just a wall of shoe trees.   Hmm. Okay.  That said, upstairs plays differently from the more traditional Irish style pub on the first floor: dark, ambient, warm by virtue of its heavy wooden overtones, the acoustic act playing guitar when I stopped in seemed appropriate to the pervading vibe of the room. If I were around more often, it's pretty safe to suggest that upstairs at Dandelion Market might become a regular hang. As it is, I'll look forward to popping back in next time I'm in."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Dandelion Market around 10:45 pm on a Thursday night.  We were staying in the area for a long weekend and I discovered it on yelp while simultaneously having drinks at TILT and seacrhing for a place nearby that we could grab a late dinner.  The atmosphere of Dandelion Market is small, cozy, dark, and inviting.  Our server was really sweet and did a great job of tolerating my slightly inebriated husband and myself.  This is a tapas style restaurant so we ordered abottle of wine and several small plates to share.  We enjoyed the cheese plate, prosciutto crostini, sausage stuffed poblano, mac and cheese, and the seared ahi tuna.  Everything we had was absolutely delicious; I especially liked the prosciutto crostini, which was the perfect combination of sweet and savory.  My husband really enjoyed the mac and cheese, which tasted like the roux was made with bacon drippings.  We both agreed we would return here the next time we visit Charlotte--it's a great date night spot!"}
{"text":"Want to go to a bar with a younger more upsacle crowd? This is your place.  If prohibition was high school, then you would move on to Dandelion Market  to hit up college parties.  The people here are generally better looking and more mature.   The Food  The food here is awesome.  The calamari is some of the best I had in Charlotte.  One night though, it wasn't done so well.    The mac and cheese is my favorite although some people may find it a little too rich.  I think its perfect.  The lamb lollipops are bomb ass.   Soul has them beat on their lollipops, but they are a close second.  Dandelion's whole menu seems tapasy which is fine and its not overpriced at all.  I think you get a decent amount for what you pay.   Bar If you arrive before 10pm during the weekend there is a giant table upstairs that lifts up into the celing to create a dance floor.  The DJ plays a good mix of hip hop, old school, and top 40.  There is great energy in this place. The drinks aren't too bad and their is always a special such as $5 bacardi anything etc.  If its too much upstairs you can always go downstairs for a more relaxing mood.  ."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fantastic. Bar upstairs for fun. Dinner downstairs. Pub feel - Irish pub. Great beers. I had a pint of guinness   In general good food but a little too heavy on the salt.  Blackened Tilapia - nice spice but a bit dry Steak skewers - delish Stuffed zucchini cheese is baked on top and yummy, zucchini is a little mushy Mushrooms are savory"}
{"text":"There are so many great places to eat in Charlotte, but every time I visit I have to stop by Dandelion Market. I love their dinner menu, made up of small plates. They had a decent drink menu. My family and I ordered the Cherry glazed lamb lollipops (my personal favorite), the sweet potato gnocchi, fried pickles, ahi tuna and then 2 more plates of ahi tuna because it was a big hit! The servers worked as a team so we were well taken care of. My only complaint would be that the food took longer then average to come out.... and the place was extremely noisy. Keep in mind, it was a Saturday night and they were packed! I can't wait to return, preferably for their incredible looking brunch!"}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoy my visit here every time. Perfect for any occasion! The small plates are perfect for sharing. Servers and host(ess) are always friendly and knowledgeable. If they suggest it, try it!"}
{"text":"Dandelion is a fun place to have dinner if you are wanting casual date night or just wanting to hang out at the local (meat) market. For food.. I loved the Mac and cheese. Yum !!! Very reasonably priced bottles of wine. We also had the cheese plate and sausage stuffed pepper, which were ok. The best part was the service. It was really top notch. Staff were very busy, but made you feel like you were their only customer. We had a great time ! Well done dandelion !!  See ya next time for a drink when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Dandelion is one of my favorite places to go in Charlotte if I'm hungry, but not too hungry. The atmosphere and food are both fantastic, especially if you're on a first or second date. They have bottles of wine all for $25 bucks, get out of town that's amazing, especially if you don't know much about wine and you're trying to impress a lady.  I don't feel like Dandelion needs more people singing it's praises, but last night I went and got the green beans.... wow, just wow. Never has such a simple food made me crave it the way Dandelion makes me crave it's green beans. They knocked that one out of the park."}
{"text":"The prices were kind of high for kind of mediocre food. The service was terribly slow and inattentive: we waited about 15 minutes to place an order and the restaurant was half-empty. We made the mistake of ordering the \"flatbread with goat cheese and pesto.\" Instead, we actually got a cracker with broccoli-like material on top. Turns out, that was rapini, the bitter cousin of broccoli making a surprise appearance since it wasn't listed on the menu. The server had to point to the micro splash of goat cheese hidden under the rapini, and we never did see the pesto. Most of our other food- calamari, brussel sprouts, short rib (singular)- was merely OK but not worth the price. The sliders were really good. The brunch here is good, but I would not go back for dinner and would not recommend it to friends. There are tons of better places nearby."}
{"text":"Went there last night with a big group. We ordered the entire menu. I was so disappointed, really it was just a bunch of bland food accompanied by overly exaggerated dips and spreads, the lamb lollipops were gross, and the mini sliders were unbeatable. The best thing on their menu was fries. I totally recommend getting fries when you come here. Plus the restaurant was SO DARK I had to use my phone for a flashlight. I walked out of there starving!! McDonald's has better fries for cheaper prices and you will be able to see what your eating!! Plus all the trash that was on the floor going down the stairs......."}
{"text":"Was in town from Boston to see a comedian perform,and stopped in here. Very hip interior, and friendly waitstaff. It was fun to order so many tapas-style meals, and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"So Google Offers is another Groupon clone.  They had an offer for Dandelion Market the other day.  It just so happened we were staying at a hotel a block away this weekend, so I purchased the offer, which was only valid for brunch and lunch (both served until 3pm).  Our waitress was nice, but our food took forever to come out and the restaurant was not packed.  Even still, they brought me the wrong omelet.  My wife's omelet was cold in some spots, and for $11 you should use real crab.  She is a native soiutherner and knows here grits, and said these were terrible.  The highlight was the home fries.  I like those but maybe because I was hungover.  I am glad we only paid $10 for this meal, because it wasn't worth much more than that.  On the positives, they had a decent beer selection and make your own bloody mary bar."}
{"text":"Always good with a few tiny exceptions! Nice accomodating staff and overall good service. Favorites: sweet potato gnocchi, short rib. Good cocktails, sometimes the pours are on the smaller side.  Although recently they've changed their patatas bravas and I am really not a fan - they were dry and covered in an  homogeneous paste of tomatoey sauce and almonds. Pretty unappealing and the taste was not good. Bring the old recipe back, please!"}
{"text":"it seems like every week there is a new place in uptown throwing their hat into the restaurant ring, so opens dandelion market.  a few of us stopped in after a game for some food and drinks.  we found a very warm and inviting place with welcoming smiles from the bartenders and servers.  our server explained the portion sizes and offered some good recommendations, and explained they were out of an item or two.  I had chicken wings and chips. both were great.  the wings had a classy kick to them and the chips were thick and well cooked.  I was surprised that a new place had such spot on dishes.  I didn't notice many \"just opened\" issues and the bartenders were extremely attentive.  nothing worse than going into a place and there is some piece of candy (male or female)  behind the bar texting or just ignoring patrons. not here, all business.  the selection of draft beers is probably the best in town and i look forward to trying them all.   the upstairs is surprisingly large and doesn't have that \"smoked in\" smell/feel that some older (&fun) places have.   the local owners worked hard to make this place stand out and it shows. great food, great service and a great atmosphere.  I have only eaten there once so I'm gonna go with four stars, let's see how well they're doing a couple months into the game.  But for now- eat and drink up at a great place.."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere for a glass wine or beer.  Tried Korean bbq short rib.it was ok. There are other entrees I like to try..unique menu"}
{"text":"Dandelion Market has two sides to it. The night time bar/club side and the daytime food side.   The night time bar/club side is a place where everyone goes at the end of the night. Somehow everyone ends up there so it is a great last spot to come to before heading home.   The daytime food side is an ok place for brunch but the appetizers a really great. I would suggest coming here on a weekend just to chill try some beer (they have samplers) and have some bites with friends."}
{"text":"Decent place with a cool atmosphere. The bartenders' attitudes on a Saturday night leaves much to be desired and the Sunday brunch wasn't anything I couldn't make at home. And make better. This places has a sweet decor but everything else inside is just meh. Thanks Dandelion but I'll spend my dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is by far my absolute favorite place to eat downtown with a group of friends. The prices are great, the wine is wonderful, the service is fabulous and the atmosphere is cozy. Love it."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday, 1/18/2017, with a group of coworkers. Our server, who is working on her level 1 sommelier,  was very friendly, and personable. We ordered two bottles of wine, and some tapas. There was a special on wine's by the bottle ($15 a bottle), and they were surprisingly good. We all ordered 2-3 small plates and shared everything. The lamb lollipops were a hit amongst the table, as well as the ahi tuna. The Szechuan green beans were a personal favorite. Lots of great items on the menu. Overall, the experience was great! Can't really beat great service AND great food.     Recently went back to this place and it was still wonderful. The service was great again, Thanks Sam! Ordered a few bottles of wine, and their lemon pound cake shots are AMAZING! The only new thing I tried that I hadn't already eaten before were the chicken wings and they were fantastic, as well. Thanks again for another great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great place to grab dinner with friends. They have several small plate options which are great for sharing. Service is pretty good as well. It's a great place for late night dancing if that's your sort of thing!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was pretty good! Arrived early so no wait. Opens at 10a and sat upstairs. I got the migas which was sooo yummy. And my fiancé got the French toast and the Carolina shore omelette. He enjoyed it. Plenty of food and definitely needed a take home box. We will back soon for dinner."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday. We had to wait a bit before we were greeted. Had some tasty biscuits that were served before our meal with some nice jams. Enjoyed a mimosa but they also had a bloody mary bar. Ordered the eggs benedict, it was tasty, but small portions. Maybe I was just really hungry. Overall, moderately satisfied."}
{"text":"I really like the decor and artworks. Decent beer choices and food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place is trying to be a gastropub or a vegan hippy fest.  The ambiance = gastropub, the food is like = vegan hippy meets fried southern.  They are trying to be all things to everyone and they failed.  The food wasn't terrible it just wasn't good.  It came out hot the staff was friendly.  The beer selection was ok.  We got the home made chips (nothing special), the ahi tuna (slightly overcooked) but with tasty dipping sauces, and the meat/beans/cheese in a skillet :(  Save your money and go down the road to Ri Ra or a half dozen other fantastic places in Uptown."}
{"text":"WOW, what a fantastic place! We found Dandelion Market on 360Charlotte.Their food was amazing, the atmosphere was quaint and cozy yet lively and fun and we can't wait to bring more friends and come again. Don't go without ordering The Lamb Lollypops (and being Greek I am very picky about my lamb) and the Ahi Tuna. By far the best on the menu but still so many good choices. The wine selection was great and for $25 a bottle how can you go wrong? After dinner, go upstairs for some DJ fun as they raise the table and the dancing begins. We and our friends ventured out from the 'burbs and we are so glad we did. Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Love this tapas place.  Tip: share your dishes! Everything is unique and tasty. Awesome, accommodating service and recommendations by server. Inside is beautiful, and history of building is interesting.   Loved pork belly.   Will return."}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could! A great place to share some small plates with friends and they also have a decent beer selection. Fried pickles are on point!  Perfect atmosphere and always great service. I would recommend this place to anyone. I always take family and friends here when they're in town."}
{"text":"The only flaw was the noise level.  It is loud.  The don't take reservations for fewer than 8 people.  Every single dish was delicious.  Service was impeccable and friendly.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So happy that I ate at Dandelion Market while staying in Charlotte. I only ate one dinner out during my short trip, and I'm confident that a visit here was the best decision possible.  The menu has so many fantastic sounding small plates that it can be tough to decide what to order. Because all bottles of wine were 25 dollars, we started there.   After a great deal of consideration and some input from our very sweet waitress, we went with four of the small plates. Fried pickles, smoked wings, goat cheese and prosciutto crostini and short ribs. The portions were generous, and definitely were not as small as other tapas spots that I've been to. Especially the fried pickles, which came with more then I've ever seen on one plate. Because of that, we could have probably done fine with 3 items.  Everything was well prepared and delicious. The pickles were perfectly fried and crunchy, the short rib was melt in your mouth, the crostini was generously topped and the wings were smoked to perfection. Judging by the food photos and smiling faces around us, I'm sure that nothing on the menu would have been disappointing.   The service was excellent and the prices were fair. 25 dollars for any bottle of wine is a steal. Next time I visit Charlotte, I'll want to try new places but will have a hard time not returning here. It's just that good!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Came after work with about 8 ppl and got a nice Center room table. We were tempted to order the whole menu (which they have an option on the menu that is pretty well priced). We opted for about 8 appetizers and drinks. The only one we all agreed was blah was the Mac and cheese. It didn't have any seasoning. Other than that, everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Dandelion Market is great for a chill lunch or dinner with some humongous sized tapas! I went on a Friday night so the downstairs area was LOUD. However the upstairs dining area was great and not too noisy, I'd recommend that instead of downstairs if your ears are assaulted when you walk in. Also it's dimly lit if your date's looks aren't doing it for you.  The drink specials are really good, you can share bottles of wine on the cheap with your dinner. However the chef might be trying too hard to be edgy on some of these dishes and they are definitely not described adequately. The menu rattles off their ingredients however fails to describe the actual dish. Shrimp and Grits for example sounds pretty good with goat cheese, and red pepper cream sauce on the menu right? The grits are fried and reminiscent of the french toast sticks I got served in the cafeteria in middle school. Surprises are fun except with food you've ordered.  Everything however is fairly priced and 2 tapas were enough to satiate my appetite. I recommend asking what you are ordering before you place it here unless you like surprises, otherwise it's a very nice place to grab a bite and drinks."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and dancing, after dinner service hours. Only in town for a week so might as well hit this \"dance club\" up.  The bar downstairs was nice, not packed, regardless of the line to get in outside. Not worth the 5$ cover to get the shortest, and weakest drink I've had in a long time.  Go upstairs, sweaty smelly wanna be club. All I could smell was the dudes puke on the floor next to me at the bar. Head down. Literally unresponsive. Pointed him out to the bartender. Not sure if she handled it, cause I drank my drink, and left.  Maybe come earlier, for food. Only because I haven't had it yet.... Lol"}
{"text":"Honestly, if I had to choose just one restaurant uptown where I could eat, this would be it.  I have eaten here 15+ times, and NEVER have I had a bad experience or not thoroughly enjoyed all of my food.    Dandelion Market's menu is made up of small plates designed to be shared.  I would recommend ordering 2 - 3 small plates per person.  They have 2 bars - a small one downstairs and a larger bar upstairs.   They offer all of the bottles of wine for $25 and have 8 -12 beers on tap, along with a full bar.    A few items that really stand out on the menu include the ahi tuna, proscuito flatbread and sea scallops.  That being said, you really cannot go wrong - pick something, you'll likely love it!!!"}
{"text":"First time at the DM, in town for a meeting. Smallish but dark and cozy. Sat at the bar and had a couple local brews. Once I got used to the sweet sauce, the lamb lollipops were excellent. Sidy was the most courteous, conscientious bartender I've met in a while. Good food, good drink, great service. Will be back.  Finishing the review a couple days on. Still have positive things to say. Enjoyed the food, the bartender was great. Small-ish and dark, but in a good way. Felt comfortable. Would go back for the lamb alone."}
{"text":"So I was put in charge of date night... He wanted cabo in noda and I said I wanted something new... Not disappointed. Anna was amazing and super helpful! Food here is beyond good! Service is great and we left super happy. The fried green caprese, lamb lollipop, calamari everything was awesome. My boyfriend loved the sliders! The man highfived me on my choice which means a lot."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our dinner here on a Sunday in mid-July. Amanda was our waitress and took good care of us and, I think, got some food running help from the back of the house which was nice to see. We liked the portabello mushroom 'fries' and the spinach salad was good. Both the Dando Ribs and a side of Mac n' Cheese were good and quite generous portions; one question though, why are the ribs offered KC or Memphis style instead of NC style? for a visitor from MA this felt like a missed opportunity. Since I had ribs in Memphis a few years ago I went for KC which are wet (as described) and good but I'm pretty sure I would have liked the Memphis even more. The Sweet & Spicy green beans were cooked well and had the sweet but lacked the spicy. One thing to be aware of, it wasn't even that busy when we were here but it was pretty loud. I imagine that when it's real busy the wood floors and hard surfaces (we were downstairs, I think they also have an upstairs dining area ) make conversation very difficult."}
{"text":"I'm new to the Charlotte area, so found this place based on internet reviews like the one I'm writing now. This place is trendy, intimate, and a must-see while in Charlotte.   This is a small plate/tapas bar, which I was already a fan of going into it. Dandelion Market did not disappoint! Our group tried their arugula salad with fried brie, brussel sprouts, sliders, patatas bravas, proscuitto goat cheese bites, and ahi tuna. All of these bites were INCREDIBLE! There were so many other options to choose from as well if these don't sound appetizing.   All in all, it was a fun little place to grab dinner with friends. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte two weeks in a row and made sure to come back each time! Allison was our server the first time and Rebecca the second, and they were both attentive and fabulous! The calamari was very good, and the aioli was amazing, but beware because it's quite garlicky (not that it's a bad thing!). My coworker got the hummus and raved about it. The lamb chops were fantastic, and the salad that came with it was very good. I also tried the pork belly, and it was good as well! Will definitely come back every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Still a 5 star experience!  Took advantage of a $3 pint, the Spaten Oktoberfest.  Wasn't quite as good as being in Munich in the Spaten tent for Oktoberfest, but it was a darn good beer!  The St. Rita cocktail was good, and we also had a good bottle of Malbec.  Food is all still just as great, mussels, frites, crostini and scallops.  I could have ate more but we had to get to a show.  I really like it here, oh and it got crowded for a Monday, had not experienced that here before!"}
{"text":"We had a few locals recommend this place and boy I'm glad they did! This place is similar to a Spanish tapas bar but no Spanish food :) We ordered the calamari, fried pickles, portobello fries, hot wings, and cheeseburger sliders. All were amazing! The calamari was probably the biggest dish and the best small plate to share with four people. But, overall all the plates had plenty of tastings for all. The smallest portion was the sliders there were only two small sliders. For dessert we had the Carmel Brownie and the Key Lime Cheesecake, both were delicious! The service was great and the location was perfect! Near uptown Charlotte where all the bars are located."}
{"text":"Met a few friends here out one night.  The food was above average and it was not too late so the upstairs was not extremely crowded yet.    It's true, the downstairs has a vibe was chill and you could tell the upstairs was going to be a blow out for a Saturday night. I loved it though - I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dandelion is one of my all time favorite group spots! My friends and I come here for birthdays and other celebrations because we love ordering all of the small plates and trying a bit of everything. The Mac and cheese, chicken wings & lamb are to die for. We order the mussels and scallops a lot too. It is a bit loud if anyone is hard at hearing and the upstairs turns into a party scene later in the night."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday with my coworker and it is now one of my favorite places in Charlotte. We split the Mac and cheese, pan seared ahi tuna, spinach and artichoke dip, and hummus. Everything was cooked to perfection, we were both stuffed but didn't want to stop eating because it was so good! Everyone we encountered from the hostess, wait staff, and bar tenders were all very friendly and made our experience here a very positive one! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Dandelion Market is a pretty great tapas bar right in the thick of things in Charlotte. I highly recommend the Sweet Pototao Gnocchi and Korean BBQ Short Ribs! Great atmosphere and very helpful staff."}
{"text":"Met up with family from Asheville and Atlanta.  Great place to enjoy small plates of goodness!  Started with the Southern Caprese - fried green tomatoes with mozzarella and a fig balsamic drizzle.  Added the pepperoni & mozzarella & pesto flatbread and fried pickles with horsey aiol.  Nice start with good flavor.  Round 2 - Red Pepper Artichoke Dip, Shrimp and grits with goat cheese & a red pepper cream sauce--interesting as we first thought the shrimp was sitting on a crouton - actually was a \"grit cake\", creative!  Round 3 - Black Bean Sliders with house made guacamole and a grilled green tomato,  Pommes Frites.    Last round was a doozy - Market Mac-n-cheese with smoked pepper and buttered breadcrumbs and the Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops served medium rare with black cherries along side a spring mix with a feta vinaigrette....OHHHH MYYYY!  Lamb was the hit!!  All that can be said is \"we'll be back to try the rest of the menu!\"  Katie took wonderful care of us!  Wine specials on Tuesdays.  Nice craft selection of draft beer.  Plan to stay because you'll want to linger over every bite!"}
{"text":"I found this place accidentally.  I was looking for a place for lunch and headed down a street filled with neon signs. A lot of people spilled out the door so I decided to give it a try. I sat at the bar. I ordered a Pelligrino orange and a seared ahi salad.  Steven the bartender is personable and polite.  I'm looking forward to my meal. The drink was nice and fizzy & it was served in a wine glass with a slice of fresh orange. The salad had a good portion of seared tuna & some nice greens. It was hearty & quick. I will go there again. (2/28/2013)"}
{"text":"i used to shy away from small plate eateries thinking why pay so much for so little. Then i realized it pretty much works out for us as the cost equivalent to 2 entrees minus the excess food forcing me to stuff myself.    We were craving absolutely nothing, so we decided to just go Uptown for dinner on a weeknight. We ended up parking on Church Street and wandered down to Dandelion Market. Two seats had just opened at the bar with no wait, so the bar we sat. The bar lady was very friendly and wore a real smile the whole night. They still have a solid beer list and the fact that they have $3 beers on Mondays sounds amazing given its Uptown location.   We had the zucchini salad, baked potato croquettes, and the trio of spreads. The pita that came with the spreads had a garlic taste with a nice touch of salt. A single spread didn't stand out over the others, but enjoyed them all. This was the most filling of our plates. The potato croquettes were good, but only came with 4 little potato thingies which seemed small even for a small plate. The scallion cream that came with the potatoes was very light and added very little flavor, just a damp texture. The zucchini salad was cuts of zucchini lengthwise with a dressing, a few craisins and cheese. A solid opening dish.   Overall, we had great beer, good food, and excellent service and i would definitely recommend this place for a weeknight dinner and drink."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Very much so willing to help make food vegan. The Minni bean burgers rock!!  Thanks.  Sprouts were happy too."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Dandelion Market has updated their outdoor signs, and website to accommodate wheelchair users that cannot fully access the establishment!   They provided A.D.A. accomodations by training staff, updating signages outside and offering patrons curbside take out.  Thank you to everyone invloved for making the accommodations for wheelchair patrons."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my father for Sunday brunch.  As we walked in the door I immediately felt comfortable, like we had walked into the right place.  The atmosphere is cool and laid back.  I also noticed the nice Bloody Mary bar which was conveniently located right in the middle of the restaurant.  While I did not partake, I most certainly would recommend it for anyone who enjoys Bloody Marys.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive, making sure our coffee and water never ran out.  I ordered the veggie benedict which was really excellent.  My dad ordered sausage, eggs, and grits.  The grits were really good and made just the way I like them.  The sausage was in large links rather than patties which was a bit unexpected.  My father did not particularly like the sausage.  I tried it and it was indeed a bit different, but I enjoyed it.  This is really a great place and I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it for myself.  All in all really good experience and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"So yeah, solid small plates for the most part, good beer selection and a cozy enviroment.  It is more of a pre game spot for going out since it does get uncomfortably crowded on weekends in the late evening.  A bit \"fratty\", and I think they have a polo shirt check at the door, but whatever--still good food and drinks to chill out on."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this brief.  For some reason I don't feel like Dandelion warrants my trademark longish reviews.  I'm not really passionate about this place, but I've been twice and it warrants a review.  The good:  The food.  Very very good and I feel like there's a good variety of unique offerings.  The bad:  The price.  The plates are tapas style and to get anywhere near 'full' be prepared to drop 40 large per person...not including alcohol or tip.  That's why I think I'm just so Meh on this place. There are far better offerings in Charlotte where I can pay 40-50 a head and actually be full and satisfied.  I'm never full or satisfied when I leave Dandelion."}
{"text":"Ambiance  - awesome decor, flattering lighting, trendy, great vibe!  Dinner food - really delicious and fresh. Good variety.  Brunch food - taste was great, keep in mind this is not the place to go if you watch what you eat. I didn't see any lean meats available, it's all pork, sausage, beef etc. If you want to go veggie there will be lots of cheese. As long as you're ready and want to embrace it you will like it here because the flavor is great.  They are also really good about modifying, as they are cook to order as well. Also, do not look at the menu linked with Yelp because it's not accurate, just go to their website. They probably change it often, which keeps it fresh.   Drinks, great selection. Tons of beers on draft. Lots of cocktails and wines. Drinks are more pricey than other places close by.  Late night this place is a party upstairs, not a restaurant. Lots of attractive young people. Like 22-27 years olds. If that's you, you're in luck. Lots more girls than guys too. Maybe this is where we go to hide, so maybe I shouldn't announce that, but most people that are still reading this are females anyway. ;)"}
{"text":"very disappointed. in town for 1 night and looking for a great way to introduce my daughter to uptown Charlotte. this place had some pretty good reviews and appeared to be just what I was looking for.  wrong!  first of all, it's like eating in a bar/pub - very loud.  the food was average at best as was the service.   certainly not my idea of a tapas place.  wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I am absolutely a fan, a veteran fan at that.  I began going to Dandelion Market before it drew it's large nightly weekend crew, and before they began charging cover for guys.  I really love the bartenders, and the environment.  The bartenders remember me whether I've been there a few times within one week or if I haven't been there in over 3 weeks.  The atmosphere is also nice because it offers a dichotomas separation between party dance thumping (upstairs) and a busy pub atmosphere downstairs.  I've also tried some of their food before and was pleasently surprised.  My only reason for not giving Dandelion Market 5 stars is because the upstairs section on weekend is not equipt to handle the amount of people coming in.  It has been increasingly difficult to get a drink, or to even have a decent amount of room to dance.  After 11 on a Friday and Saturday leads to something I call the Sardine Effect.  I'm sure you can figure that one out.    I've had many good times here but you just have to pick and choose the nights you come or be prepared for a more crowded scene (on the weekends)!"}
{"text":"The food tasted amazing BUT there were 8 of us and everyone's order came at a different time. We were there eating for hours and it shouldn't take long to eat these tiny portions. 2 of us ordered shrimp and grits and they came out 20 minutes apart. Could they not fit 4 small shrimp on the grill at the same time? Same thing with the steak skewers. It's pricey. If you're hungry be prepared to spend a lot."}
{"text":"Baked potatoes croquettes, simple and delicious. Pizza flatbread, lol, just a pizza, was ok. Grilled flat iron strip steak, not tough and great flavor, Italian sausage stuffed Pompano pepper, my favorite dish of all the ones we tried. Again, simple and very good. Our server Rachel was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Love love this place, food is great, it's kind of a tapas place , they do catered for a younger crowd, sit and mingle kind if this. It's is also kind of a tapas place very small plate, but very tasty. I love the fried pickle, my favorite. Price is very reasonable 3 of us and we order a few plates and my husband had 1 glass of wine and our bill was like $45.00. I  just wish the had parking, cause I was pregnant and the walking distant was not that close from where we park."}
{"text":"Good spot for Sunday brunch. I've only been there twice but the food was good and the service was solid both times. If you like omelets and seafood, I recommend the Carolina Shore. It was fantastic. I paired it with the hash browns (they were ok but not the best) and a Bellini. Overall it was a delicious meal and perfect for post workout!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte on business and needed to grab dinner somewhere near my hotel. After wandering up and down the street, I finally decided to step into Dandelion Market, which my local coworker recommended to me. Despite its name, Dandelion is a bar that serves tapas and feels very much like a bar rather than a restaurant. At just before 8 pm on a Tuesday evening, there was plentiful seating downstairs and upstairs and no wait for me. I was attended to frequently throughout my visit and appreciated the service! 2-3 small dishes per person are recommended.   I ordered the pan seared scallops ($17) and mac and cheese ($8). The scallops are on a bed of collard greens and something else (I wasn't able to identify it by taste or in the dim atmosphere of the bar) and sauce. The sauce was a bit on the salty side for me, but it was still tasty.   The mac and cheese was very cheesy and tasty; I'd say it would place #2 or #3 on the list of \"fancy\" mac and cheese dishes I've had. Not the most amazing but definitely savory!"}
{"text":"This place is my kind of bar.  Really extensive craft beer menu, which includes tap dates. I had the same bartender each of the three times I went, and he remembered what I and each member of my party had ordered the previous time.  I was totally comfortable telling the bartender to \"give me something great,\" and trust he'd pull a good beer for me.  He did not disappoint.  As other yelpers have said, there are two floors, with the upstairs having a hidden DJ loft, and a large table which lifts to the ceiling on weekends to create a dance floor.  To be honest, I much preferred the earlier part of the week, where quiet blues was playing and some baseball was on the TV, to the later, louder week with the Lady Gaga and the shiny-shirted ladies and gelled gents, but that's just my scene.  The beer, the staff, and the service were great."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly bar tender and great food. Can't beat the hours, brunch until 3pm? A bar that doesn't close? This is my kind of place. Will be back later tonight for the DJ. Awesome stop on my weekend away in the Queen City!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them 10 stars I would.  The food was great but the Service was amazing.  Being told we appreciate your business and also acting like it goes a long way.  We ate upstairs at the bar and all three bartenders frequently checked on us. We had the lamb, stuffed pepper, Brussel sprouts and sliders.  Sliders we a little dry but everything else was very good.  Dessert was my favorite, Apple pie ravioli, a must try if you eat there.  Drinks were also creative and yummy."}
{"text":"This is a nice, funky tapas-style eatery in uptown. But I think the food's a little pricey and the portions too large to be a traditional tapas place. My GF and I ordered three plates each, thinking that we'd order more, but the portions were so large that the six were more than enough. The frites and calamari, for example, were as large as a standard appetizer at a \"regular\" restaurant. I'm sure Dandelion Market has run the numbers and decided that this is the way to go; however I would have preferred it if the portions and prices were split in half, so I could try a greater variety of things. Then again, my GF is mostly vegetarian and I am not - perhaps if we ate with a few more friends the cost would even out more.  Having said all that, the food was good. The Ale Simmered Sausage bites weren't as warm as I would have hoped, but the sauce was delicious. The calamari was tender and well-cooked. The sliders were delicious, although the toppings threatened to overwhelm the meat. The frites were perfectly cooked and delicious. The baked potato croquettes were tasty and homey. The fried pickles were great, albeit with an \"upscale\" take. The beer menu is nice and well thought out. The service was friendly and efficient. The decor was funky - a mix of old Dublin pub and modern hipster hangout (old burlap sacks stretched and and hung like pictures, or example).  My only complaint (save what I wrote in the first paragraph) is that this place might prove to be a bit.. twee for Charlotteans."}
{"text":"We had brunch at this location, My wife can't remember what she had, only that she wasn't too impressed with it. I had the Low Country Hash, which didn't taste bad but was a heavy as a ton of bricks.   Service was not too bad but a bit slow and inexperienced both - kids.   I used the Bloody Mary bar, I don't find it \"creative\" I'd much rather have a competent bartender make my drinks. I get the impression that their target market is not a dining crowd but young singles in search of booze and loud music  - not for me."}
{"text":"Great place and reasonable prices.  I have been to several \"small plates\" restaurants and have found most of them to be too trendy for their own good. Over priced and undersized portions. Dandelion Market was the antithesis of that thinking. I started with the Red Pepper Artichoke Dip, it was delicious and the crispy pitas were a perfect pairing. The Shrimp and Grits were flavorful with a nice presentation using fried squares of grits and beautifully prepared shrimp, but I should have opted for the larger portion because it was just that good! I also tried the Lamb Lollipops at the recommendation of a friend. They were cooked to perfection and the addition of cherry to the flavor was delightful. I just hope other diners weren't off-put by my cleaning of the wonderful crisp lamb bones.  When the bill came I was astonished, all this food for around $25. This place will definitely be on my list. I need to bring others with me so we can try a wider array of their small plates."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna was amazing! Flatbread cured pepperpni is great. Calamari is good.  Ehhh on mac n cheese and sweet potatoes gnocchi ...would probably get something else. Sauces on all was well done."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. Make sure to go for lunch one day when it's not crowded and just enjoy the scene. I took my father here for lunch and he got a roast beef sandwich and chicken fajita soup. He henhouse his. I got a grilled cheese and tomato soup. Very appetizing. Bonus, we took some engagement pictures inside and outside and lt added a cute uptown Charlotte touch!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good selection of beer. And oh yeah, my roommate works here.  The overall restaurant had a nice social vibe to it. With two floors, two bars, this place was definitely a place for bar food and drinks. Great selection of beer and sampling was a lot of fun the first time I went there.  The fried calamari was really good, I enjoyed it a lot with the sauce complementing it. The other food was also delicious, a bit pricey, but overall it's not a place to eat to be full. Drink and be merry here!"}
{"text":"Grilled wings.....amazing!  Sliders...good  Drinks - specialty joints...amazing  Atmosphere...awesome. love the chill vibe, feels like a low key spot but you can tell it's a neighborhood gem. Glad I walked in to explore this joint. Love it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this bar a 0. We did not enter because the staff were so disrespectful and rude to my friend and I (two women). We walked by two places next door to Dandelion that were packed with lines to get in. We wanted to go because we had been the previous night and enjoyed it. The men outside were demeaning and rude beyond belief, bringing us to tears. I have recently moved to Charlotte and will never come here again and will 100% encourage all of my young friends to do the same. It is such a shame because I think it is a fun place but I will never accept being treated like that."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday with my gfs and surprisingly it was dead.  We were quickly prompted to sit by the table bar area. Decoration is a bit bland. Nothing too appealing. I ordered the Ahi tuna salad, which was really good! I forgot what my gfs ordered but they said their food was delicious.  Minus one star for limited parking spaces. Ughh we had to park by a garage that was a bit far of a walk but other than that service and food were great."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a late dinner and the $15 bottles of wine on Tuesdays.  The food was absolutely amazing. The small plates are the perfect size to try a few things. The scallops and lamb were the best that I have had in a long time.   The service was great as well. Our waitress gave great recommendations and was extremely friendly. I would recommend this spot to anyone passing through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Quick late review - in Charlotte over Mother's Day weekend, stopped in here (based on a recommendation from friends) for a late lunch after Discovery Place.  Combination of soups, salads, grilled cheese and sliders.  The sliders were a bit dried out, but everything else was awesome.  Almost 5 stars."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back to this place!! Everything we ordered was delish- Shrimp and grits, spinach artichoke dip, goat cheese crostinis and wings!! Can't beat the beer specials either."}
{"text":"We are just visiting Charlotte and the Dandelion is very close... They have a great but not extensive list of Carolina craft beers but what they have was delicious .... I tried the locals and it's great, not good, not exceptional, but 9 have to admit, it worked very well with the lunch, tomato soup and grill cheese and a salad... the salad was huge by-the-by... the dressing that is available is phenomenal, Italian, lemon Italian, balsamic Italian... actually, try them together, amazing flavors... missing the last star because this was our only visit..."}
{"text":"Brunch Bloody Mary's. Mimosas.  Nice small portioned tasty food . Not stellar service but Good for a brunch."}
{"text":"Came with a group of girls a month ago, had a great time and excellent service. Bloody Mary's Bar!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Dandelion Market with friends on Saturday 11/14/15.  Have visited this location before and had loved it.  We were having a wonderful experience till the food stopped coming out.  We had several appetizers come out no problem.  Our sides showed up and then for 30 minutes no food.  Why order sides if you don't have real food to enjoy them with, so we asked to see the manager.  She had such a chip on her shoulder and told us this is the way their restaurant runs.  She blamed the server for not explaining properly how things work and was very defensive and said she would check on things.  We finally received a steak skewer and then 20 minutes later 2 shrimp but when you have four people at the table, we are hungry.  The manager came back and again repeated her excuse for the delay in food and while we were talking with her the remaining 2 dishes came out.  This manager has very poor communication skills blaming the customer and the server.  I hope they find a new manager."}
{"text":"Great Bar upstairs the Beer selection was large enough to please any beer snob."}
{"text":"Really love this place. Just moved to Charlotte and make it a goal to take all my future visitors here for Sunday Brunch.  Has a very authentic Irish Pub/Hobbit Shire feeling to it.  This would almost be enough for me except that there breakfast and lunch and Brunch menus happen to be fairly unique and delicious from what I've tried. From what Ive hear and from my 3 experiences eating here, I would say that you can't really go wrong.  I will be back."}
{"text":"First time for brunch and mixed feelings. I got the veggie Bennie which was kind of weird.  I like the concept but it's tough to cut through the portabella. Also used waaayyyyy too much hollandiase.   Bf got the low country hash which was awesome. Lots of flavor and just the right size.  Yummy drinks and free biscuits definately made up for the lackluster entree."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places in Uptown, deserving of a repeat visit. Come in early, and be prepared to get more than you expected because your eyes will be bigger than your appetite. The drinks here are amazing -- the Holy Water is my boyfriend's favorite, although I really liked the Twinkle Toes myself.  As for food, you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. It's split up into sections for small appetizer plates, staples, house favorites, and surf and turf. My boyfriend and I pick about 4 plates and that's enough for two -- and of course, if you have lots of guests for dinner (or just big appetites), you can get everything on the menu for $295. The last time we went, we ordered fried pickles (that horseradish aioli is amazing with the pickles), sliders (you get two), sweet potato gnocchi (soft, with a nice sweet potato and cinnamon background with the cream sauce), and the croquettes (perfectly fried and definitely reminded me of a baked potato, especially with the cream sauce that came with it.)  Plates come as they are ready and the service is great. They also feature amazing desserts -- we got a cookies and cream cheesecake and it was definitely a good end to an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"We were only in Charlotte for one night, and Dandelion Market was where we started our Charlotte adventure. We passed by this place and said to ourselves \"this could be cool\". The place is pretty dark but still manages to keep a cozy, southern feel.  And so we sat at the bar at around 5 or 6 pm on a Friday night. It was pretty empty, so we sat down at the bar and began chit-chatting with our bartender. I think his name was Drew. Really cool guy!   I was pretty surprised that with the awesome beer selection at the bar (Arrogant Bastard on TAP..? Wow! ) , the place was empty for just after 5pm on a Friday. That was until some guy dressed in full-on J Crew prep wear sat down at the bar and ordered a Miller Light.... huh??!   We soon found out that Dandelion Market is more into the nightlife scene. We spent most of our visit watching staff and 7-8 bartenders prepare for the night to come. Stocking glasses, making sure there were enough lemons and cherries, etc.  Our bartender clued us in on other awesome places to check out while we were in CLT, which was much appreciated. We did visit most places that he recommended, and we felt like we got a really good feel for the city. +1 for awesome staff!  I don't think I'd be interested in visiting this place when they turn to crazy nightlife bar. It seems like they are going for two different crowds depending on the day and time, which I guess works for them. If I come back to CLT though, I'd be happy to return here for a beer or two."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's laid back and equally comfortable for eating or drinking regardless of the hour and the setting appeals to everyone from the younger banking crowd to country-looking people. It's one of the few places that you'll feel comfortable dressed really nicely or very modestly. I can't comment on their food because I've never tried it and the drink specials aren't usually too cheap but it IS uptown after all"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with coworkers and everything was really enjoyable. Portions were good for the price and each small dish satisfied the four of us. The pommes frites were awesome and my favorite- slightly battered, crispy and hot. We also had scallops, meatballs (these were just okay-a bit firm but good flavor), prosciutto crostini (almost like a dessert), portobello fries, wings (little dry), and lamb lollipop (yum-great flavor and perfectly cooked medium). If I'm back in the area will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Went with some co-workers on a fairly quiet Tuesday night. First impression - very comfortable atmosphere, reminds me a bit of RiRa. Place looks like it's been there forever. . .really like the table layout and the big common picnic table in the middle of the first floor.  Food: as others have stated, this is a pseudo-tapas place, but with a Gaelic twist. There are the usual standards (calamari, wings, beer fondue) and some really interesting unusual items (duck flatbread pizza, fried oysters, fried sage leaves). Everything we tried was very good, portions were generous. In particular the crostini and sage leaves were excellent, the lamb lollypops were also very good but you need to like your lamb rare.  Drinks: Very cool, local, unusual beer selection. A plethora of wine selections under $25 per bottle, which is nice.  Service: Prompt, polite, and easy. Who could ask for more?  Overall this place is a welcome addition to Uptown and I will visit again!"}
{"text":"Ok but not great.  We ordered a wide variety of dishes, but the food seemed to have a very narrow range of taste.  Service was slow-ish"}
{"text":"I really love this place. I've been here three times now- for dinner tapas, lunch with a girl friend and also for Sunday brunch. It's in my neighborhood and has a wide variety of things to choose from- we got a ton of small plates to choose from (caprese to salmon cakes to brussel sprouts) when we came for dinner, which was perfect for two people to share. Shortly after I met a friend for lunch, where we both got grilled cheese and tomato soup- so great for these unseasonably cold winter days.  So brunch is interesting- it's served until 3 and all their specialty items look amazing. I settled on the hash and my BF got the migas. I loved my hash- full of potatoes, andouille sausage and okra- spiced to perfection and not too filling. The migas were pretty eggy though- definitely could have used more fillings and less egg. I also noticed a bloody mary bar (we just got coffee), which is also a cute brunch touch."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal. The grilled cheese and tomato soup is amazing and just about everything on the dinner menu has been delish!"}
{"text":"The best just keeps getting better.  Somehow in all my trips to Dandelion Market, I'd never been seated upstairs.  That changed this morning at Sunday brunch, and the upstairs room is even cooler than the downstairs room!  Upstairs is huge with tall ceilings, exposed brick, and a full-body knight's armor in the corner.  A long, dark wood table fills the middle and was hosting a small party this morning, and booths and tables line the perimeter.  The bar was long and inviting, and the bar stools looked super cushy and comfortable.  As always the food was delicious, and the eggs are still massive!  I can't wait to go back for a drink and sit at the upstairs bar."}
{"text":"Dandelion Market never seems to disappoint. I've been there for dinner, late nights and now mostly lunch.   So on my most recent visit, we were there for lunch. We had a small wait for a table of four. The space does seem a little small for lunch time and typically the upstairs isn't open at this time. At this time of day you can order small plates or from the lunch menu.   I was super impressed that there were so many veggie friendly options. Recently I've switched to a plant-based diet and eating out can be hard. I actually had options here! I ordered a portabella sandwich with a side salad. The sandwich was delicious. The mushroom wasn't too rubbery or juicy. The pesto sauce and garlic  aoili were nice additions. And the ciabbata bread was a perfect match. The salad was also good, but pretty basic with mixed spring greens and cherry tomatoes and a basalmic vinegrette on the side. As a meal, it was very satisfying.   I'd love to come back for brunch sometime. But I highly recommend Dandelion Market for any occassion."}
{"text":"I have been to Dandelion several times and really enjoy it! Lunch and dinner menus are completely different. Lunch offerings are simple and fairly limited.   For the first time I got the wild mushroom flatbread and simple salad. Well they aren't kidding when they say simple salad! It literally is a plate of mixed greens and that's it! The balsamic vinaigrette is creamy (how of they do that) and delicious! My flatbread was delicious, cheesy and perfectly cooked! But I have to admit I was disappointed as all it had on there were sliced button mushrooms. I do not consider those wild mushrooms! Regardless it was tasty!  Dinner is always a treat as they offer a huge tapas menu! Can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"My friend and I randomly strolled in here for dessert one Sunday eve, after my normal cupcake spot was closed. Best decision I ever made!!! They had a car bomb cupcake made with Guiness and Bailey's I think. 0_0... It was warm, and chocolatey, and everything I hoped and wished for. I will definitely be going back for lunch or dinner!!! The ambiance was great for a posh evening or a date. Staff was very friendly too! :)"}
{"text":"Great service, food and ambiance. The bar upstairs is cool. The lollipop lamb chops are delicious. I had he cheese board to start which was very good. Good wine and beer selection."}
{"text":"Grabbed a late lunch here with my husband & the food was delicious! I had the grilled cheese & tomato soup, he had the roast beef. Both on thick cut toasted sourdough bread. The atmosphere was quaint and cozy. There were several vegetarian options, which was nice. I didn't partake, but the bloody mary bar for brunch folks was a nice touch and looked like it had a good variety."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, their menu descriptions are not accurate. For example, I believe pork products MUST be disclosed in the ingredients of a dish, but that was not the case. I ordered two dishes: Mac and cheese and scallops with collard greens. Both dishes contained bacon without it being disclosed on the menu."}
{"text":"Dandelion Market is an excellent choice if you don't have a big appetite. they have some amazing dishes under Small bites section. This place is bit loud but filled with fun and excitement. Shrimp and grits and the lamb lollipops are must eat !!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to get lunch since the place we wanted to go to had a 30 minute wait time, and we were hangry! Had this place bookmarked & figured 5 min walk, why not? Walked in and they weren't busy at all, it's a small place with a bar and some tables. We came in at 3 and they told us they still served brunch- yasss! They gave us some bread to start out with, it was okay. I felt like it could be better if it was warmed up a bit. I ordered the caprese benny, lord it was so eggy! I feel like there wasn't enough bread on the bottom, but I really enjoyed the hollandaise sauce & the bread that it came on though! I tried some of the hash browns, and grits lorrrd the hash browns were SO salty!! But the grits were really interesting, it tasted like there was corn bits in it? Very good! But the service was supppper slow. Mind you there like 2 tables in there including ours but our server was so. slow. The food took a while to come out, and we had a hard time flagging him down for a refill & the check. Plus it was super chilly in there! :("}
{"text":"It's a nice booshie uptown place to go. Great food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Visited this little gem back in Sept. We found it from YELP reviews. This place was just what we were looking for small plates bursting with flavor. It is quite dark so if you go at night sit by a light to see the menu. Give it a try you may like it!"}
{"text":"If this place were $2 cheaper per plate for lunch or offered that much of a discount on some things given a certain day, my co-workers and I might consider frequenting Dandelion Market weekly or multiple times per week. The lunch menu is simple, but delicious and well presented. Over the course of 3 visits in parties of 4+, everyone has loved their food. From the simple touches of \"Guinness spiced ketchup\" to the super crispy fries, everything is fantastic food wise.  What is not fantastic is that the lunch plates costs $8-10, and will run you $12-15 after taxes and tip. It is definitely competitive in the uptown lunch space for quality of food within that price range, but at the same time, uptown Charlotte has many overpriced lunch eateries.  Using Restaurant.com, you can average down the bill for Dandelion to $8-10 after tax and tip, which makes it much more exciting to frequently visit. Limited menu, but I'd get it over and over... and over."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Dandelion Market for dinner on our drive down to Florida for our honeymoon. I had heard that Charlotte had a great food scene, so we figured it was a good place to stop along the route.   We shared five small plates: arugula salad, prosciutto crostini, sweet and sour green beans, spicy potatoes, and black bean sliders. The arugula salad was large and refreshing after a few days of eating meals on the road. The potatoes were cooked wonderfully -- tender with delicious crispy bites -- but the spicy tomato sauce topping was a bit too hot for my taste. The green beans were my husband's choice; I'm not much of a green bean fan, but with the sweet sauce and macadamia nut topping, these were probably the best I've ever had. The crostini were my favorite item: creamy goat cheese and crispy prosciutto. We were underwhelmed by the lack of flavor in the black bean sliders at first, but they grew on us by the last bite.  But by far the best part of our Dandelion Market was the service. Our server was friendly and attentive, and when he found out we were on our honeymoon, he served us a free apple turnover and vanilla ice cream dessert, which was a phenomenal way to end the meal. We left the restaurant full and happy!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and we were not disappointed. Their Low country hash is wonderful and filling. Prosciutto Benny was really good as well, but it was a smaller portion. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to place in uptown. The portobello fries are amazing. They have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Fabulous evening. Friendly staff. Roomy decor for a downtown spot. Lots of choices with a variety of taste profiles. Sweet, asian, fresh and bright tuna poke was a great start. Lamb kebabs added a smoky Morroccan flavor. They were spectacular. Brussels sprouts with golden beets and bacon added a little vegetable and a rich, earthly tasting dish. Seasoned broiled scallops were in a tamarind sauce and a perfect end for our savory foods. We saved room for dessert: a brownie Sunday. Service throughtout is friendly, he session, but not in any way intrusive. Excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute place.. it's for the most part very good. We enjoyed the Mac and cheese and asparagus... wouldn't recommend the fries.. they are literally frozen crinkle cut fries at a high price (not what I expected).. I also wouldn't recommend the sea dog cocktail. It was $14 and it really did just taste like ocean water."}
{"text":"Awesome service (for lunch at least). Our waitress was very nice, and suggested the tomato soup grilled cheese. We went with that and a side of the fries. Absolutely delicious. So much so that we have ordered the same thing on door dash a couple times even though we live right down the street. Just what you want on a rainy day. Definitely Recommend."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit this place last night for the Hendricks Gin Cocktail hour.  It was great.  I will definitely be back.  Con:  like most places Uptown, parking."}
{"text":"Holy cow. I mean I'm actually mad at myself for living here all this time and never coming into this place for food. Hands down some of the best food Ive had in awhile. I came here with my best friend Stefanie and our style is always to order a bunch of items and share them as well as a bottle of wine. They had half price bottles that night so it was an easy decision. We shared the mussels and I have to say they were probably the best mussels Ive had not at the beach. The other item I ordered were the crab cakes. Now I like to think of myself as a sort of crab cake connoisseur.  If a restaurant has them I will order them. This was to die for. I was not only impressed I have been talking to my guy about them since the night we went. I will be dragging him there very shortly and now that I'm talking about it it will probably be tomorrow.   The service was also amazing we sat at the bar uptstairs and our bartender was attentive knowledgable and friendly. The prices were more than fair and for the quality of food to be honest they could charge more.   Dandelion market is uptown so the parking situation can be just that a situation. Its totally worth whatever you have to go through to get there though. I honestly cannot wait to go back and would recommend this to anyone with tastebuds."}
{"text":"Wow.  I absolutely loved this place.  I was in from out of state and this was on my hosts' MUST TRY list because they love the menu and the atmosphere.  I couldn't agree more, it's fantastic.  Our party of 4 arrived around 6:30 (no reservation) on a Friday night and easily found a table. I really like the vibe inside..it's cozy with the wood and brick.  The waitstaff explained how they work things (you order food, it comes out when it's ready) We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, grilled steak skewers, pan seared ahi tuna, fried pickles, meatballs marinara, baked potato croquettes and proscuitto crostini.  The only semi dud was the meatballs (too firm but tasty).  My favorites were (in this order) tuna, steak, proscuitto crostini.  The prices and portions are decent for sharing.  I've been to other tapas places and what I really liked about Dandelion is everything was kind of normal, not too foodie-out-there (i.e. what regular people eat).    YUM!"}
{"text":"Dandelion! Not only are your evening dance parties amazing, but your dinner is romantic, delicious, and intimate, you sly dog you. I used to only see dandy as my last stop on a night out and the best part of my bachelorette party, but my eyes have been opened to the remarkable food and ambiance provided by dinner. I've come here twice before going to shows and had amazing times both times. The most recent experience we got to enjoy a half off bottle of wine and some delicious small plates. My husband has small plate anxiety and refuses to share tapas but the serving size at dandelion is okay with him. We shared a couple sides and he got meatballs as his protein while I ordered the short ribs. Both were amazing. Every dish is beautiful and delicious. If you haven't had dinner here yet, you must!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in charlotte to go to with a large group! You can order the WHOLE menu for under $300 and it easily feeds 15 people. The food is delicious and you get to try a bite of everything! Scallops, lamb, gnocchi, sliders, flatbreads, fried pickles... everything tastes sooo good!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night around 6:30 pm; our party of 3 was seated right away (no reservations needed). We shared 6 dishes family style and left full and satisfied.  Food: My favorites: Pan seared ahi tuna (nothing too unique but it was executed SO well. The tuna was fresh, seared and perfectly rare in the middle and the wasabi aioli, a delicious complement), and the baked potato croquettes (4 perfectly battered and fried baby potatoes served with scallion sour cream). We also tried (in order of preference): the roasted garlic hummus (comes with a pail of pita and a hummus spread, half covered in crispy chickpeas, half in olives), pan seared scallops (comes with 3 scallops on a bed of sweet potato puree -- this dish included everything that I loved, but I wasn't blown away by the execution; it didn't have the nice sear that I was longing for, was slightly overcooked, which didn't go super well with the texture and thickness of the puree), dando brussel sprouts (I wish they were more crispy and carmelized than they were!), and grilled steak skewers (comes with 2 skewers; this one was super underwhelming, very generic).  Service: The service was awesome.   Ambiance: The interior is dimly lit, with exposed brick, and nice big, rustic wooden tables.   Will definitely be back to try out other options on their menu and another round of the ahi tuna and baked potato croquettes!"}
{"text":"Went on a quiet Sunday night.  Staff was very attentive and we sat at the picnic table on the second floor.  The room had a cool feel to it, and the lighting was just right.  The food was amazing.  Everything we had was spectacular, especially the sausage bites.  The flat bread pizzas were also very good (we had the duck).  Next time I might go for the $200 have every single tapa in the resturant deal.  Beer selection was great and bartenders were really friendly.  All in all a great addition to Charlotte's uptown restaurants.  I will be going back time and time again."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch so my review is limited to that.  There was so much here that I wanted to order, from huevos rancheros and migas to biscuit sandwiches, but we both set our sights on the monte cristo...ham, turkey, cheese, on French toast with blackberry preserves for dipping.  They were delicious!  Our waitress was also fantastic...very friendly and on the ball.  We needed a quick meal before leaving town, and this did not disappoint.  If I came back to Charlotte, I'd love to try their dinner menu, as it looked equally appealing.  Also, we found the price to be very reasonable for the portion you got, so I'd highly recommend it as an awesome, centrally-located brunch spot in Charlotte.  We were staying at the Marriot, and it took like two minutes to walk there..and they open for brunch at 10 AM, while many other restaurants we looked at didn't open until 11."}
{"text":"WOW! Can I just say hands down some of the best food I have ever had! We ordered the seared ahi tuna, the PEI mussels, and the sweet and spicy green beans. Then to finish it off we got the brownie sundae! It was amazing. It was my first time eating mussels and they were my favorite dish of the night! Service was great! We were seated quickly and the service brought the food out fast and hot. Great place downtown to eat for a good price. Highly recommend for anyone who can't decide what they want to eat. This restaurant allows you to have many different food choices for when you can decide! We will definitely be returning to try more!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Lovely restaurant in the nook of west 5th street.  Place - Upon entering the establishment, it has that nice english pub feel, that is inviting with a rack of wooden shoe stretchers on the right hand side. I believe there is another floor of the restaurant.  Food - The fries were delicious! I had ordered a pizza mushroom bread - which I wished I did not order.  The dinner menu looked awesome! Wished we came by for dinner instead, since the lunch menu was a \"meh\" to me.   Service - The waiter was nice and attentive.  We were able to get seated right away, since we came early - 12:30am, on a Friday - yay us!  Price - It was somewhat pricey, but managable.    Future - I will definitely be back for dinner and try out their scallops."}
{"text":"Our dinner here last night was amazing! They were out of a couple dishes and beers because of the thanksgiving holiday but we understood. Our waiter was nice and gave great service.   We got: -charcuterie board- awesome selection, loved the honey and figs, all the cheeses were our favorite! -fried Brie salad- fried Brie was obviously amazing, the vinaigrette was spot on and the addition of the poached apples went perfectly  -scallops w/corn- soooo good! Wish we had some hot sauce to add but we are hot sauce freaks  -sweet potato gnocchi- taste like thanksgiving dinner in a bite (not a bad thing!) but really it tasted like dressing, gravy, sweet potatoes and everything amazing about thanksgiving all in one -Brussels sprouts- we love Brussels so we had to order these! I really liked them but they were 5% too salty for my taste (but we like less salt on most things)  We will be back next time we're in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Totally unexpected from the outside. Very tasty drinks and small plates. Mac and cheese is great. Green beans are amazing. Curry turkey meat balls are less than okay. Calamari Is pretty good. The lamb lollipops are amazing and the shrimp and grits were a little disappointing. Service is great"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and the food was awesome.  Craft beer list also had a nice variety between local and nonlocal. After dinner, I order the mucho gusto cocktail, which had great flavor, but too much texture (chunks of pineapple) going up my straw for me to finish it. As the Saturday night went on, this place turns into a nighclub. We stayed for a few more hours and enjoyed dancing the night away.   Megan was also great!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of hanging out with bartender Zy on a slow Sunday night. I was on business and I always ask waiters or bartenders about their fave places. Zy gave me quite a list of restaurants, bars, etc. Dandelion Market is my kind of bar, very cool place with lovely people working. Thanks again Zy.I took her advice as was very glad. I want to come back to dandelion market for brunch and dinner, sounds excellent."}
{"text":"The hostess was welcoming. We were informed a table was being cleared off and then we would be seated but we were starving so we chose the bar. The bartender was great. She was quick and attentive. My girlfriend ordered a mimosa and she said it was great. I ordered a bloody Mary as they have the bloody Mary bar set up. To eat, I ordered the Veggie Poached and it was delicious. I thought the lemon in the hollandaise sauce would over power but I was wrong. Honestly, the best tasting poached eggs with hollandaise sauce I have ever had. My partner ordered the waffle with a side of hash browns. She thought her food was great as well. We live in Atlanta and it is my 1st time in Charlotte. Thank you for the awesome brunch on Valentine's day!"}
{"text":"You have to do the brunch Bloody Mary bar!  Given a shot of vodka of your choice you approach a bar that has anything & everything you ever thought of putting in a bloody mary.  Next are the freshly baked home made biscuits.  I could make a meal on these.  So many different mixes & all the trimmings.  Then you get to the menu & the food is great.  A southern flare with twists.  I am a seafood lover & the Crab Cake Benny and the Carolina Shore Omelette are amazing.  The Lamb Lollipops are tasty & well prepared.  Everyone is friendly & the service is fast though we love to lounge at the bar over our meal & that's perfectly okay too."}
{"text":"Whatever it is another night club for kids.  Yes these are 20-something Bud Light drinkers and there are fights and the floors are sticky.  Music is usually the latest pop stuff on the radio.  You get the idea.  So if you are in the mood for exactly this kind of thing then you know what you are getting yourself into here!  :-D"}
{"text":"Dandelion is great. What else can I say about a place that has good beer, cheap wine specials and good food. The service here is also pretty good and the food comes out sans problem.   You can order a couple of things for yourself or order for the table and share (I think it's better to share so everyone gets a little bit of something). I'm a big fan of the lamb lollipops, mac and cheese and fries (which come out super crispy).   We went on a Tuesday when they had $15 wine bottle specials and they are well worth it (both the white and reds). Everyone got something a little bit different and had a bite, overall the bill was not astronomical and we all were full by the end. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a bit to eat or just drinks uptown."}
{"text":"The service was absolute crap! We asked our waitress if a dish contained meat she told us \"NO\" and the item did. Instead of taking the dish away she argued with us.  She then proceeded to point us out to the cook. He looked directly at us and shook his head. Unprofessional is not a strong enough adjective to describe the staff.  Be prepared for small dinner plate portions. If you're on an Ethiopian diet then this is the place for you! The food was edible, but not amazing...... We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"i met a few friends here when i was in town on business.  It is a laid back place that has a huge beer and wine list.  The food is all small plate - tapas style.  We had the steak skewers, fried pickles, fries, prosciutto crostinis and calamari (there were 5 of us).  The food was all good - the crostinis were in my opinion the best.  Steak was cooked perfectly.  Overall it was a great place to hang out and catch up.  The bill wasnt too bad after a few rounds of drinks and those plates of tapas.  I will definitely return when i am in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"It looks and feels like a great coffee shop with a great menu and decent selection of  beers.  Great atmosphere and a friendly staff.  Free WiFi."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and I thought the decorations and ambiance of the place were gorgeous. We went for dinner and the food was a little overpriced, but it was in downtown so one might expect that. The prices are on their online menu. There were many different plates to choose from to satisfy anyone.   The food itself was very good. I had fried pickles (very good) and the mustard ale cheddar sliders. The only thing I didn't like much about the sliders was that the bread and burger were slightly dry but the overall taste was good. My companion had the market macaroni and cheese and baked potato croquettes and enjoyed both. The horsey aioli served with the fried pickles was amazing.   The service was slow but the food came out fairly quickly. The waitress was friendly and got everything we needed, it just took awhile. It was quite loud but not enough to make me want to leave.   Overall, I would go back. I enjoyed the food and atmosphere very much. I am not of drinking age, but they had a large selection of alcohol for those who are. I didn't end up ordering it, but dessert is offered of you ask the waitress what they have. I'd say give this place a try!  One thing I thought was really neat that I have never seen before was the option of getting one of everything on the menu if you have a large group. It was $275 I believe and would be a lot of food as the dinner menu is pretty big. So if you have a large group and want to pass around and try everything, the option is there. I would probably call ahead for that anyway though. This is on the bottom of the menu but I haven't done this myself."}
{"text":"First off, Dandelion Market has great atmosphere. They serve food Tapas style (small plates). I like their Red Pepper Artichoke Dip, Fried Calamari and Seared Ahi Tuna. The Grilled Lamb Lollipops are also popular. Dandelion Market has a good variety of beers. It is a great place to have a team dinner. I like the second floor for that."}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner, and it did not disappoint. The bartender/server was friendly and helped me make some selections off the menu. Chicken wings were delicious; sweet flavor and moist. The shrimp&grits was also pretty good, came with 2 decently sized shrimp, good flavor. The place was a bit loud, but only cause there was a large group of people drunkenly shouting amongst each other.   The server was really nice too! Recommended some solid beers and made decent conversation."}
{"text":"Two Words: Lamb Lolipops. WOWza. Definitely licked my plate.  I haven't had anything off the menu that I wouldn't enthusiastically order again. This place is awesome--from the cozy downstairs bar area to the hip upstairs (equipped with live DJ on weekends, and a dancefloor)... this place has everything--great food, great bar, great atmosphere. Pricey, but awesome to go with a group or on a date!"}
{"text":"Tried Dandelion Market last night, and like other reviewers, was really impressed! Great addition to Charlotte - lots of original menu items at reasonable prices and a great beer list.   We tried several of the Apps - I loved the fondue and fried artichokes, never seen those before and in the South we fry it all, so why not??   They also have a great beer selection - found a new favorite, in fact. If you like Allagash, try their Witterkirke - I've never seen it on a menu before and I'm heading to Total Wine to look for some for my fridge!   We were upstairs, which was getting crowded with after work peeps, by the time we left (9ish) it was packed! Our server was very attentive to our large group and the food came out really fast!  Good to see a newer place doing so well! Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I totally can't vouch for the food at this place, but let me tell you...this is the place to be if you're looking for some casual Saturday night dancing to good music while the drinks are flowing.  We got there around 11:30ish.  The bar downstairs was pretty dead at first, which was perfect.  That means no line to wait for drinks.  We got our drinks and went upstairs, where everyone was hanging out and dancing.  All of the bartenders were really friendly and were pretty fast in making the drinks.  They also did a great job with making good drinks super fast, so you never had to wait too long to get served.  The music was a ton of fun.  All songs that you can sing along to.  Even though I wasn't on the hunt, there were a TON of cute guys here.  To all the single ladies, this is the place you want to be on a Saturday night.  The crowd was fun, not rough.  Certainly a place you can get hit on buy a guy and score a few free drinks.  Dandelion seems to have done a great job as a crossover day-restaurant/night-bar.  Based on some of the other Yelp reviews, I'll have to come back here sober and try the food."}
{"text":"I'm glad they offer vegan options, although I wish they would state them on the regular menu instead of making you ask for a special tiny menu. It's a bit awkward. Also awkward, was getting my own plates, since they all had to be modified to be made vegan, instead of sharing with my friends. Of course, I guess that is because of the restaurant style, not this particular restaurant. Obviously I'd go to an all-vegan small plates place if I had the choice! Anyways, on to the food. I had the vegan versions of the hummus and pita, black bean sliders, and green beans. It was way too much food, even though they suggested 3 plates per person. But it was all very good! I especially liked the flavor of the sliders. The drinks were good too, and our server was great. All in all, not worth the money, but the food was good."}
{"text":"In the Queen City for a reunion of sorts, Ole-Peeps celebrating their youth of many moons past...6 of us found our way to this establishment mid-evening, given various personalities/appetites we settled on the \"One of Everything\" menu....multiple bottles of Cava and other vino selections...plates were quick form the oven to the table, all were tasty as well as the juice...Neat spot by the old Ivey's Dept Store...another memory of an era of many moons ago....Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We tried Dandelion Market again, but for dinner and it was just as good! They have tapas style dishes for dinner, but everything we tried tasted amazing! - the shrimp and grits, sweet potato gnocchi, and prosciutto delisting were among our favorites. We also got a brownie with ice cream for dessert that was soft and warm, it was a great meal."}
{"text":"Had the mussels, ducksalad, southern cap rear, calamari, scallops and lamb lollipops. All amazing!! Would recommend and come again when I'm back in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place! Came here for the first time today for brunch. We don't come to Charlotte much, but stopping here will be a must from now on!  I had (the world's best) grilled cheese and tomato soup while my hubby had the Monte Carlo. Both were superb! A cozy little restaurant.... Not too crowded, with just the right vibe. Will definitely return! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and bar selections! A long wait but that's because everyone wants in! The customer service was pretty good. She was definitely busy but very efficient and personable!"}
{"text":"Honestly the juevos rancheros was horrible. It should really be called juevos diarehheros, because it look liked someone shitted in a skillet, put an egg on it and fried the whole thing. I can't believe the chef honestly had this item on the menu. Please order it, you shall be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Great stop on a lazy Sunday downtown. Went in for lunch, thinking maybe a salad or something light and ended up eating two eggs, sausage and fruit (life's about balance, baby). The food was outstanding. The service was a solid B+ and would've been better if my server had offered to refill my drink, which ran dry. Outside of that, things were great. Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest and admit I've been avoiding trying their food, even though so many people have told me how good it is and my fellow Yelpers are all in agreement that the food is delicious. My issue is that I've only been to Dandy when its after 12am and when I'm not really looking for a gourmet meal if you know what I mean...  I am also going to admit that my fears were unfounded. I went at 11am on a Sunday and the floors were not still sticky, there were no errant beer bottles rolling around, and there was no lingering sweat/stale beer smell in the air. I ordered a coffee to start (blue laws are the bane of my existence) and it came with a cute mini milk bottle full of cream. Refills were frequent and the coffee was on par with other brunch places in the area. I was pleasantly surprised when they brought over mini biscuits with apple butter and jam. The biscuits were a little overcooked but honestly any place that gives you free carbs as an appetizer is a winner in my book. I ended up ordering the migas as my meal because I can never have enough Mexican food in my life. The eggs were well cooked and spiced well. I was a bit confused on how they wanted me to eat them - as a taco? as a burrito? as nachos? I ended up eating them as scrambled eggs and ate the tortillas on the side. Overall, I definitely recommend Dandelion as a good option for brunch when you don't feel like waiting for a table at Zada Janes. I can't wait to go back and try their dinner/lunch menu as it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"This place popped up on one of my searches so I decided to get a large group together for dinner. Some people mentioned it was known for brunch and the club upstairs but after seeing all the food pictures I decided to ignore popular belief and go with my gut.   Intuition served me right. The food was amazing!!! The scallops were cooked to perfection accompanied by some sort of purée that really brought together all the flavors. The lamp pops were insane and with just a touch of sweetness - oh and the cherries on the side of the plates were incredible. I wasn't terribly impressed with the Brussels sprouts - they could use a revamping but other than that it was Devine."}
{"text":"How can anyone go wrong with small plates to share and $25 bottles of wine. I am in!!! I love this place. Everything is always excellent and fresh and the staff are always so friendly and positive.   Shrimp and grits, southern fried caprese, fried pickles, ahi tuna.... yea take me back, asap!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for an afternoon drink while \"bar officing\" or an evening of fun noise, great tapas, and a vibrant crowd!  I live in the neighborhood and came here last night after being ignored for five minutes at a highly rated neighboring restaurant.   Dandelion never fails to offer attentive and friendly service at the bar - my absolute favorite tapas dish is the cherry lamb lollipops.  The saltiness of the lamb combined with the sweet cherry sauce and six divine little cherries on the side makes me happy!  They have a nice selection of local beer, a full bar, and, again, friendly people!"}
{"text":"I know this place is also a nightclub I think but my review is based strictly on my visit here during lunch.  I found the menu to be full of healthy selections and refreshing, light lunches.  I had the Boars Head turkey sandwich on rye bread with a spinach salad for the side.  The sandwich came with the basics, tomato, lettuce and light mayo.  Nothing to write home about really regarding the sandwich but something to note is that it was a decent portion size and fresh, so no complaints.  The side salad was fine, a little overdone with the vinaigrette dressing and no real accouterments in the salad, strictly spinach leaves.  It was still fine.  I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu options soon :)"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the week-came here on a Sunday for brunch. Ordered the \"prosciutto benny\" which was delicious. Best part about this restaurant is the atmosphere and the homemade biscuits with jelly/jam. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went for the first time for Sunday brunch and had a fantastic time upstairs!  Although a little chilly, we quickly warmed up with hot coffee and biscuits and cornbread served as soon as we were seated.  The build-your-own Bloody Mary bar was incredibly creative and fun!  We spent two hours with friends just enjoying each other's creations!  The food was awesome (the ham and cheese omelette was melt-in-your-mouth!  Will definitely be going again soon."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. We always order several small plates to share. Most of what we ordered was fantastic. Of course, as with most tapas places, I think that the pricing is high for the amount on the plate. But it's very unique and so close to the bell theatre that it's a great place to go before the theatre."}
{"text":"We dinned 2/3/15  Atmosphere: Restaurant is tucked away on a street. We almost passed it! When you walk in, it's extremely dark and really loud. BUT we were siting next to a table of 10. Our waitress was kind, but was far and between when checking on us.   Food: A great range of tapas food. From vegetarian, sea and meat. It's hard to pin point what stood out because we ordered at least 15 different plates. But personally the Prosciutto Crostini sticks out. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. It was a bold punch of flavors. That just melts in your mouth. I would go back JUST to eat this. We stuck with a bottle of wine and skipped deserts.  Overall: Would I return? Maybe at lunch if it was better lit? And was able to have a conversation with my colleagues. Also for the crostini. Wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"DANDY! Why have I not reviewed you yet?   This is a favorite among my coworkers and I, what with the close proximity to our restaurant, the amazing food served til midnight, and $3 Pint Night. The small plates are perfect to split, or to just order 4 and eat them by yourself as I have been known to do. The beer cheese fondue and fried artichokes cannot be beat.   I usually stay away from the upstairs, especially on weekends, as it does tend to get crowded and douche-y. (And really guys, $3 craft pints and you just got a Miller Lite? Really?) They usually play good music, but I'm just not a can-of-sardines, beer-spilled-on-you person. Nah, I'm really more of a downstairs type of girl. Downstairs is pretty awesome though."}
{"text":"Caught up with a friend and had a quick dinner on a Tuesday night. It had a lot of people there watching the game and socializing, which gave it a nice casual feel. The room itself was on the dark side which made it intimate but contrasted the noise of the crowd. It's a small plate format, so I ordered the lamb lollipops and the brussel sprouts which I HIGHLY recommend. The portions were decent but definitely on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Wandered into the Dandelion after a long flight from Seattle to Charlotte, and was pleasantly surprised by the place.  Looks like most other Irish (or pseudo-Irish) bars, but the gent behind the bar had a rather authentic accent, which is usually a decent sign of things to come.  I had wandered in during happy hour, which I discovered is an excellent time to join the festivities, since they have $3 drafts - any beer.  I tried a local Amber by Birdsong, then a traditional Belgian dark/sour called Klokke Roeland.  Both beers were great buys for the price.  As to food, I ordered fried pickles (being in the South, that's a must), some fries, and their Mustard Ale Cheddar sliders.  The servings were GIGANTIC - definitely not what I had expected from a tapas menu, and could easily have served three people, not just one or two.  The fried pickles were pretty good, but the dipping sauce made up for the lack of \"dilliness\" that I like in my pickles.  The fries were amazing, but I couldn't even make a dent in the serving.  But the sliders.  Oh.  My.  God.  The bacon on them was awesome, they weren't over-cheesed like so many burgers can be, and the meat on them was so juicy.  Plus, they were HUGE...I managed to down one and a half, which is why I couldn't dent the fries.  Walked out with a bill under $30, which is rare when traveling and heading out for a dinner on the town.  Would highly recommend the place for anyone looking for tapas-plus."}
{"text":"Ambience is great, food is Meh.. nothing out of this world except for the fried calamari that was seasoned and fried to perfection!"}
{"text":"Once again, thank you YELP!  We arrived around 7pm on a Friday night so it wasn't crazy. Ate downstairs which was perfect! I think that my wife and I both said \"I like the feel of this place\" more than once.  Great craft beer selection on tap. I don' t think they had any macro crap coming out of the pipes.  This place specializes in small plates. Our waiter was great and suggested 3-4 if looking for dinner x2.  VERY difficult to decide.   We had the cheese board, stuffed poblano pepper.  These were both repeatable offenses.  I had read about the lobster Mac n cheese. Our waiter mentioned it was gone but later returned informing us they had 3 in the kitchen. We grabbed one. WOW!  Lots of lobster, very creamy, and only $3 more than regular mac? YES PLEASE!    When we return, it will have to be on $3 draft night!"}
{"text":"1. Go here for the bar... great drinks and good choice of beer and wine. This area saves Dandelion Market from being downgraded to a two star...  2. The food menu is a tapas approach with a wide variety of food.  3. The downer... the food was simply bland.      - The shrimp bruschetta was a complete myeh... come on chef, dare to present some unique flavors!!!     - The black beans sliders look great but, again, a flavorless mass of myeh!     - The red pepper dip was pretty decent but lacked zing! Whenever I start looking for sauces to add to a dish that means that nothing is baked into the original recipe.  A caveat... the other dishes may be simply awesome and we just happened upon the three items that were myeh... please prove me wrong with the other dishes.  4. Service is well done but the young lady who seated us was a bit grouchy... after we sat down we both laughed and told her, under our breath, Have a Nice Day!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must go to if you are in Charlotte, NC.  I was taken here for a business dinner and we ordered \"everything on the menu\" literally.  It was so awesome I had to make a stop when I came back into town.  This time we just sat at the bar, a much smaller group, and we each ordered 2 items to share and a flat bread.  It was plenty of food.  I also love the beer selection and the bartender was really awesome!  I will keep going back. :)"}
{"text":"Dandelion is one of my go to places to eat and drink in Uptown. I love the diverse options for food and the rotating beer list. Every time I'm there the staff is friendly and staff."}
{"text":"My favorite go to! Service is friendly and professional. The food is unbelievable!! I think we have tried most everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. They change up the menu at times to reflect what's in season. Wish I could give this place 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Now, I hardly ever review on Yelp. I just stalk around. But Dandelion Market gave me no choice. On vacation in Charlotte from Richmond, Virginia my boyfriend and I chose this restaurant spend our three-year anniversary evening at based on Yelp reviews. For a Monday night there was a good amount of people present and the atmosphere is lovely. Compared to restaurants in Richmond that offers small plates, this plates beats them all. We had the sweet and spicy green beans, which were sweet, sticky, and delicious. The fried pickles with horse radish aioli which were excellently fried, the Brussels sprouts which were extremely flavorful and the pomme frites which were incredibly crispy and came with a delicious house made ketchup and we shared the ghiradelli salted caramel brownie sundae which was huge and only $6!!! The music is very tasteful, and our waitress Kylie was so attentive and sweet. 100% recommend this place if you're looking for a casual nice night out. Thank you Dandelion Market for topping off our vacation."}
{"text":"Dinner menu is always relish. Drinks are tasty. Servers and bartenders are always friendly. Lunch menu feels like it's lacking the same amazingness as the dinner menu. Got a weird piece of ahi tuna but the bartender took it off my tab."}
{"text":"Went back to Dandelion this weekend, and the food was superb yet again. I recommend the steak kabobs, red pepper / artichoke dip, stuffed poblano, and chicken remoulade. I have my heart set on trying the mac and cheese, but that will have to wait til next time!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best food I've had in awhile! The Pinot Grigio is delicious also!"}
{"text":"One of the best tapas places around.  The entire menu is stellar- but the highlights for me were the rich, smoky mac & cheese, the outrageously flavorful sweet and spicy green beans and steak Skewers.  Our group tried 15+ samplings. Almost all plates were enough to share between 3-4 people, though the skewers are made for two.  Food came out, as ready, at staggered times and was always quick and fresh.   Nice bar selection- drinks were hearty with a heavy pour :)"}
{"text":"Great brunch on Sunday mornings. I love the food but the service is awful. Food took a long time and then the woman beside me had celiac and ordered gluten free waffles and was served regular waffles, when she asked the server, she said she was not sure if she had the correct waffles. After which they never addressed the problem. The manager came out and literally threw the waffles on the table without apologizing. The girl even stated that she was not upset about the mix up but the way it was handled."}
{"text":"My boyfriend used my corporate discount to buy a coupon to take me out to dinner while he was in town :) He's such a Romantic....  We were there on a Sunday night and were joined by four? other people. This made me appreciate the social nature of our waitress who I do believe I went to highschool with (I hope my super cute boyfriend didn't make her jealous).   As for the food, small plates were perfect bc I like EVERYTHING. We had the antipasto, the cheese plate, and the cucumber salad. The antipasto was pepperoni, Spanish chorizo (the hard kind), soppressata(?), and olives. The cheese plate was a 3 out of 4, but I was happy to find one of them was from Sheep's milk!  They had a pretty good beer selection, and I did really like the interior.. Exposed brick walls, and dark woods... Not what I originally envisioned for a place called the Dandelion Market."}
{"text":"Amazing affordable wholesome food! We loved the grilled steak skewers and prosciutto crostini. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great brunch menu. Got the Carolina Shore omelet - amazing. Great game day atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I have been a long time advocate for Dandelion Market, not only for their menu but the ambiance of the split level restaurant and bar. After making AND confirming reservations for a party of 7 for a bachelorette party, your staff member knew and confirmed 7 did not meet the 8 minimum requirement and confirmed the reservation anyways. We show up, excited (keep in mind, there are many other places we could have chosen to go and we chose your restaurant) and ready to start a good night, only to be greeted with a questioning of our reservations and absolutely no apology or concern from your manager that there was a blatant mix up. Unbelievable! I love this restaurant and this was completely baffling to me. Such poor customer service. Poor management. And with no concern to help adjust the situation. I, myself, have recommended and/or had my own reservations for parties here. I will not be taking my service here again for gatherings and will not be recommending this as a staple visit for anyone in downtown Charlotte. Very disappointed from this experience and I hope management can handle situations like this in a better way, in the future. Better training is needed all around."}
{"text":"Food is great, atmosphere fantastic, service could be better.   Still a great regular spot in uptown for drinks and small plates"}
{"text":"I love this place. Its such an amazing vibe and reminds me of a few places back home. A lot of cheap small plates which are all amazing. We had the noki and cheese plate and were amazed on how well it was. I would recommend anyone to come check this place out."}
{"text":"The food was incredible! The lamp lollipops alone were worth the 45 minute wait. Delicious! We also got steak skewers, Mac and cheese, and fried pickles. A medley of awesome flavors and I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great.  Great food, great service and great beer selection.  The small plates were excellent and great for sharing.  Would definitely recommend to anyone in or traveling to Charlotte.  Especially great service from Lyndsey!"}
{"text":"When you don't know where to eat, and what you want to eat. Two words: Dandelion Market. When you fancy some good little bites, and you don't want to hurt your wallet. Two words: Dandelion Market. Another win in my book. Two words: Dandelion Market.  - BBQ Short Rib: Oh...my...goodness. ($12.00) - Chicken wings ($6.00) - Calamari: Crispy and delish. ($9.00) - Fried pickles: A bit over cooked. ($6.50) - Gnocchi. Very good. ($8.50) - Ahi Tuna. Must try. ($13.00) - Steak Skewers. Seriously Yummy. ($12.50) - Pommes Frites. ( $6.00)  The food/drinks were presented to us by very friendly staff. Over all great experience. Very highly recommended for groups who like to share or individuals who like to try food in small quantities.   Don't put it off any longer, and giveDandelion Market a try.  Four and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"Still a good fall back place when all other places are either closed or just too busy and perfect for Sunday brunch, but I still find their food a bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here for dinner on a Tuesday night and absolutely loved it! The food was excellent (mussels, calamari, ahi tuna, mushrooms and fried pickles), the drinks were great and our server, Amanda, was awesome I would definitely recommend DM and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Everything about it. The service, the atmosphere, the food - everything was awesome. Katie H. was our server and she was incredibly friendly, knew a lot about the menu and was eager to give recommendations on both beer and food. My friend and I split the mussels and they were so amazing. The sauce was to die for! So much so that when we got fried pickles, we ended up dipping them in the sauce from the mussels instead of the sauce they came in. I live in Atlanta and was just visiting Charlotte but I know I will be visiting this place again next time I'm in town. And I'll definitely be asking for Katie H.!"}
{"text":"It was my anniversary, and I wanted to try somewhere new.  Luckily, I had a Groupon for this place and had been wanting to try it for some time.  The atmosphere was dark and intimate and the food was AMAZING!  Too bad I could barely converse with my partner across the table.  We came here on a Tuesday, and it was not terribly busy.  However, there was a large table of about 10 people here, and the noise was deafening.  We started off sitting right next to that table, but luckily we were able to move.  Since the downstairs area is relatively small, we couldn't move that far away.  Even at the new table, it was still pretty loud, but we could actually hear each other talk.    Anyway, that was the only negative.  Now - on with the positive.  They have a great selection of beers there, and on Tuesdays their bottles of wine are only $15!!  We had beer and decided to get four plates between the two of us.  We started off with the calamari, which was a surprisingly big portion for a \"small\" plate.  The calamari tasted fresh, the batter was light, crispy, and flavorful (almost like a light tempura batter).  This was served with a lemon aoli, which I thought had a great garlic flavor.  I really enjoyed this dish  After that came pan seared Ahi tuna.  It was perfectly cooked rare, and it tasted like it had never been frozen.  On the side is a wasabi aoli and sweet chili sauce.  Now, I do NOT like horseradish at all, which makes wasabi pretty much a deal breaker if even a little bit comes into contact with my food.  I actually enjoyed the aoli, which had only a hint of wasabi.  The chili sauce was awesomely flavorful and really complemented the aoli.  Very delicious!  The portion size was pretty decent for the price.  Next came the lamb lollipops and the autumn gnocchi.  These two items stole the show!  The lamb was very tender, and not overly seasoned.  The cherry sauce served with it was amazing, and it very much complemented the lamb.  Oh, and the gnocchi - HEAVENLY!  The squash was caramelized perfectly, and the dumplings themselves were tender.  The gnocchi was the best I've ever had.    Our server was friendly and attentive as well.  If it had not been so loud in there, I would have enjoyed the atmosphere a little more.  However, I can say that I greatly disliked the chairs there.  I have short legs, and I had to sit on end of the seat so my feet could touch the floor.  Next time I might have to try the plush-looking bar stools.  I am definitely coming back here again.  I give the food 5 stars for sure.  Overall, I'd rate it about 4.5 stars total."}
{"text":"I had been in the mood for grilled chicken wings all week and it's hard to find a restaurant that serves grilled wings. They're usually fried and greasy! After learning that the Dandelion Market had phenomenal GRILLED wings, I had to give it a try!   They recommended two meals per person because they are smaller plates for sharing. I ordered the fruit-n-nut salad. It had poached apples and pears, cranberries, figs, candied pecans, point reyes bleu cheese, mixed greens, citrus white balsamic and olive oil. I had them switch the blue cheese with goat cheese. My friend ordered the Mediterranean Trio and DANG...it was good! The trio had lemon garlic hummus, sun dried tomato tapenade, tabbouleh and pitas.  My wings came out after the salad and they were everything I hoped for and more. They were PERFECT! Crispy, sweet, spicy and juicy! My friend also ordered the black bean sliders and said they were the best vegetarian black bean sliders she's ever had.   I also had breakfast there a couple weeks back and I can't wait to go back again. I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this place out.I ordered the Dando veggie omelet with a side of bacon. The omelet had havarti cheese, tomatoes, peppers and onion. I love an omelet full of flavor and this one hit the spot. Their coffee was PERFECT. It tasted like French press.   My waitresses were super nice BOTH times and it's such a fun environment. The decor is dark and rustic. I love the lighting and the brick walls. You can sit upstairs or downstairs!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Dandelion is Sidy. That is besides the beer and food. Sidy is my favorite bartender in all if Charlotte. I love going to a place and the staff is happy to see me, knows my name and is quick to keep my glass filled.   The food is also quite good but will admit, I usually only go for drinks once or twice a month. Tapas is served, which is good for sharing but can really drive up your bill if you get hungry.   Since I'm a happy hourer, I'm usually out the door before the Uptown madness starts.  But from what I hear, it's a good place to meet the young and beautiful after dark."}
{"text":"Great Snack size meals. Perfect for a beer and snack. Visited the place while in town, and was here for dinner. Loved the beer collection. The food size is small but tastes so good. Loved the dishes we ordered. A must visit place if you are in downtown and hungry."}
{"text":"I love a tapas place as I often travel alone and these places allow me to add more variety to my meal. I was in the Queen City on business and my Yelp Mobile App led me here.  I liked this place enough to visit more than once.   This place has a nice dark pub atmosphere.  It was so dark that I actually needed to use the flashlight on my phone a time or two to see the menu.  To me the emphasis seems to be on the bar as opposed to the restaurant.  The tables actually look uncomfortable.  One of my visits was on a Monday night and $3 drafts were featured.  Every brew was #3 and that means about twenty taps.  That's a great deal and at 7:30 the place was packed.  The beer list is decent and well thought out.  It's not Flying Saucer crazy big but it's broad enough to satisfy most beer folks.  They also have a short list of specialty cocktails that they execute beautifully. The Cucumber Mint Mojito was excellent.  By the way, the bartenders here are excellent and customer service was never a problem.  The first tapa I ordered was the BAKED POTATO CROQUETTES - $6 that came with aged cheddar, Beeler's bacon and scallion cream. They arrived quickly and were plated beautifully.  They were good but not great.  None of the flavors had enough intensity to really tingle my taste buds.  They are missing something and the chef needs to think that through.  Next up was SAUSAGE STUFFED POBLANO PEPPER - $8 with Italian sausage, cheese, and house made crema.  Now this was more like it.  This dish was bursting with flavors that melded together perfectly.  I enjoyed every morsel.  Finally, on another visit, I tried the MUSTARD ALE CHEDDAR SLIDERS - $9 with Beeler's bacon and  l&t.  What was inside the bun was one of the best sliders I have ever tasted.  It was juicy, perfectly seasoned deliciousness.  Unfortunately the bun spoiled what could have been an amazing plate.  First it was cold which is totally unacceptable and second it was slightly dry.  What a shame. The bun should have been fresh and grilled.  One again this was a miss by the chef.  I want to love this place and it has a lot going for it. The atmosphere and the beers are right on.  The menu looks fantastic but the execution was flawed with two dishes I tried.  It's time for some attention to detail.  I can sense greatness but we're not quite there yet."}
{"text":"The website makes this place appear a lot larger than it actually is - at least on the first floor. My friend called and asked if we needed reservations she was told no but when we got there we had about a 10 min wait for a table . I'm learning to just make reservations whenever I go out to any semi popular restaurant in Charlotte even the chain restaurants. We were seated near the bar and brought water and shot glasses ... like seriously I guess the water \"glasses\" go with the ambiance but they were literally the size of a large shot glass... Since  I would have looked like an idiot putting a straw into a shot glass I decided on a glass of white wine...  I prefer to drink my nonalcoholic beverages with a straw .. alcohol kills germs right .... I'm a huge fan of tapas or small plates because I get to sample pretty much everything, I'm not into the whole sharing thing so I ordered 3 small plates for myself.  I tried the spinach and goat cheese salad .. wow this was pretty good so simple yet so good. They gave a generous amount of spinach with pine nuts, and a scoop of goat cheese on top. Next I had the grilled lamb lollipops so yummy they were also covered in the same vinaigrette as my salad , and finally the sliders  - basically a cheese burger with some fancy bacon . Both the chops and sliders only had two servings so unless it's just two people I would either order two or get something else if you're planning on sharing with a group.  Overall the food was pretty good my friends tried the calamari, and the shrimp and grits ... and whoa who knew that you could fry grits  into the shape of little cubes.. They had an interesting taste but a strange presentation at least to me. I'm not a big fan of shrimp and grits but my friend said they were delicious (only two shrimps tho...)  I'm not sure what's upstairs I'm hoping more tables b/c there isn't a lot of room downstairs and it's super dark in there. I like this place and would be interested in coming back from brunch .   Parking - I parked in the deck over on 6th street I think there is another deck down 5th maybe .. but the walk from the 6th street deck (5 bucks) wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I ate here twice in one weekend and now, I don't want to go anywhere else. The service and the food are great. My favorite is the Bloody Mary bar on the weekends.  They set the bar up downstairs, give you your vodka and let you make your own. They have everything you will need for the perfect Bloody Mary. The music that they play is also great. I am always a fan of establishments that don't play mainstream music. I thoroughly enjoy myself here."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday for dinner and everything was excellent? The server recommended 3 plates each. We decided to split three which was a wise choice as they were huge! Great service and atmosphere we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was a great find, thanks to a local waitress from Mac's Speedway. Monday happened to be having $3 beer specials, which never hurts for 4 guys. They typically recommend 2-3 plates per person, depending on which you order.  We ended up getting a mix of 12 total, which turned out to be great.  Prosciutto Crostini....amazing! Spinach & Goat cheese salad.....needed some greens in our diet, but tasty Surf & Turf...scallops and pulled pork were both very flavorful, great dish Salmon cakes.....another tasty dish Crab cakes....I thought these were better than the salmon cakes, great flavor Sliders....sliders with bacon? enough said, delicious Ribs....wet ribs with a nice amount of meat on each, solid dish Stuffed Poblano Pepper...might have been my favorite dish of the night and very filling Mac & Cheese...very creamy and you get that hint of smoked pepper  I am drawing a blank of the last few, but I think we doubled up on 1 or 2 of the ones I mentioned.  Service was also good and the waiter was helpful in recommending dishes."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for the food itself.  Service was a little lacking though.  The brunch menu was delightful.  I ordered the grilled cheese and it was made from Tillamook Cheese!!!  I'd recognize that taste anywhere.  Took me back to the grilled cheese sandwiches I used to make myself when I was growing up on the West Coast.  Will probably be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Food and service were very good. Loved the layout and decor. For tapas, I feel that the portions were generous. There were two of us and four plates was more than enough. We really enjoyed the short ribs, sliders and sweet potato gnocchi. We went on a Friday evening around 6PM and were only one of three tables (plus a few people sitting at the bar). Was surprised that there were not more people. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworkers.  The lunch menu is very, very, very different.  It's almost like a Boar's Head Deli lunch menu.  Basically there are a limited variety of sandwiches or burgers, two soups, and maybe three salads.  The portions are much more generous for the price compared to dinner, but I wouldn't call them big.  With a group of 10, we were able to be seated on one table in short order, and the location still never filled up around us.  There was quite a bit of disorganization around ordering, but the server was sweet and patient, splitting the checks automatically and with a perfect recollection.  The orders came out fairly scattered, with two orders arriving much later than the first round.  All told, it took us just about 90 minutes to have lunch, given this awkward delay; not bad for 10 people, but seems like it could have been faster given how empty the place was.  Everyone seemed satisfied with their orders, good flavor and fresh food.  The drinks kept being replenished automatically.  I would suggest that if you order the grilled cheese, get a side of something--fries, a salad, or sliders--to go with, as that meal is a smaller portion than the rest of the options, even with the soup.  Dandelion Market, you've now got a daytime win under your belt, in my book.  I'd definitely come back here for a work lunch."}
{"text":"Great, innovative food, friendly staff, and a great drink selection in a tapas/small plate setting. The food is always good and the service is knowledgeable about selections. Another perk is the great location in Uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Small but cool restaurant uptown. The food is served tapas-style, and I got a series of sides including the zucchini ribbon pasta, dando Brussels sprouts, and the veggie skewers. Those three sides were enough to make a light meal for me. The zucchini ribbon pasta was probably my favorite, as I did not love the bacon in the Brussels sprouts. I liked the trendy, laid back vide of this place. Definitely a good place to come with friends so you can split a bunch of dishes."}
{"text":"This is an absolute must stop if you are out and about in Charlotte.  The beer selection is expansive, the menu is diverse and tasty and the service is always quite good.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place and we come here a lot. The service here is great and I haven't tried one small plate I haven't liked yet. Definitely get the sweet potato gnocchi's"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is with NC and using tons of seafood in their dishes, but I like it.  I got the Carolina Shore omelette and it was stuffed with visible chunks of lump crab, scallop, and prawn.  I got the hollandaise on the side, which made it a lot less heavy.  I still couldn't finish it, but I tried to pick out all the seafood.  The hash browns are definitely home fries, but they're crispy and tasty so no complaints there.  The bread basket options in the beginning are also pretty awesome.  Very impressed with Charlotte's food offerings."}
{"text":"Okay, to be totally fair, I would give this place another half star if Yelp let me. Also, I've been to as many gastropubs in California as my waistline will allow, so I don't mean to discourage the fledgling gastropub scene here in Charlotte. But, I can't help but compare.  The good:  The bartenders on the first floor are always *phenomenal* and the mixed cocktails they serve are innovative and well-crafted. Absolutely try the fig cocktail, which is a great unisex drink: fairly sweet for the girls, but full-bodied and not overly sugary for the guys.   Atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Some of the plates are out of this world: standard pub fare like chicken wings have that extra zip from whatever seasoning they use. Also, you MUST try the ribs and the sausage-stuffed pepper. Foodie heaven. Lamb lollipops are also wonderful.  The bad:  The food is not as well-thought-out as it should be, considering this place's fame and what they're trying to accomplish. The bruschetta is only toasted on one side, making it soft on the top of your tongue, but hard and crunchy on the top of your palette. The black bean sliders should be delicious, but the rather bready and unremarkable buns they serve them on are very distracting to the taste buds.  Full service is slow and the servers are not very knowledgeable about the food that's being ordered. I know that good help can be hard to find, but Dandelion Market needs to step up the game with its waitstaff if it wants to have the best gastropub in town. Also, having to wait a long time for your food is silly in a place like this. You have one of the most popular joints in town, put more people in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"I've been here several time. But today I decided to leave a review because of the amazing server we had today. Her name is Brooke! SHE IS AMAZING, very polite, she would check on ya regularly but without making us feel pressured. It was my sisters birthday and she made sure to recognize it with shots and a cake.  Food wise... We ordered like 7 different tapas, which all of them were amazing: wings, mussels, flatbread, calamari, chorizo cheese dip, deviled eggs... Great environment, good music (you can have a conversation without screaming)."}
{"text":"Brunch was decent. The bloody Mary's are great! Will definitely return to try the dinner/night scene."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, small plates cheap prices allows you too try many dishes. I love it!!! We had the  jalapeño Sarot Cha eggs, meat and cheese board followed by the Italian stuffed poblano pepper, and finished with the short ribs and washed down with the not your fathers root beer.  Thanks Chelsea for serving us! You were great !"}
{"text":"dandelion! We all loved everything we tried- even the sweet potato gnocchi (which reminds you of stuffing at Thanksgiving). We had the fig & goat cheese crostinis, the beef short rib, the baked mac 'n cheese (extra delish), the calamari, and the cheese charcuterie plate. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Nom nom. Came here for brunch and the low country skillet and crab cake benedict were on fleek. Small portions, but satisfying. Very hip and trendy restaurant. Dinner is tapas style and not as good as the brunch menu. They also have a Bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Smaller than I thought (maybe theres a dining room in the back?)  Great beer selection and food variety/quality/preparation was on point. I had the raved about lamb chop lollypops (get the full order not the half).  Staff was pleasant, quick and very accommodating (needed to make a show).  I'll definately put this on my Charlotte list!"}
{"text":"I experienced the \"bar\" version of this place on Saturday night.   Man, was it packed.  It did have a pretty cool vibe to it, but it was hard to enjoy it when we were all standing shoulder to shoulder and my butt got grabbed a couple times (by people you don't want to grab your butt)....  I'm sure it was an accidental \"hey, how's it going?\"  but it made me feel a bit dirty.  Crowd aside, we did not even attempt to get drinks at the bar since it would have taken a parting of the red sea to get to... plus to fight the other thirsty patrons once you got to the front.  With all the people on the 2nd floor, the floor started to feel like it was bouncing at times... we went downstairs to escape the craziness and hung out on the fringes near the kitchen.  Don't know how much the cover was for guys since a friend of ours had passes for all of us... but there was a long line outside to get inside..... I may have felt cheated if I actually paid the cover.  Probably will give this place another chance - maybe it was just a bad night for me :("}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch today and had a delicious meal.  I ordered the boss sandwich, fries (per our server's recommendation) and a soda.  The sandwich was delicious, had a great flavor too it and the dressing was awesome. The bread was fresh and better that what I'm used to. And it was a nice, big portion. The fries were equally addictive and needless to say I had people picking them off my plate.  The service was great and the decor is cool. I could definitely see myself coming back for dinner or for a few beers.   The prices weren't bad either. My only complaint is that we didn't come for dinner. From the looks of the dinner menu they have even better options at dinner time. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out-of-state and decided to dine here for dinner since this place had good reviews and our hotel was only a few blocks away. When we arrived, the hostess brought us to a table upstairs even though the lively brightly lit bottom floor was mostly empty. The upstairs is VERY DIM that we had to use our cell phone flashlights just to read the menu! TIP: If possible, you may want to request a seat downstairs instead.  We ordered (in order of our favorites):   1. Patatas Bravas (surprisingly sooo good!) 2. Prosciutto Crostinis (our 2nd favorite with a good mix of sweet & salty)  3. Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops (these were good but a bit too raw for us so we asked for them to be cooked a little longer and then they came out perfect)  4. Market Mac & Cheese (our least favorite; kind of bland)  Good, friendly service. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Apart from the sweet potato gnocchi I have never been blown away by any dish here. The food is good and serviceable but not great.   I can't stand that they charge a $5 for guys and not girls. Just pure evidence that they do it because they can get away with it. Drinks are typical pour and serve drinks with watered down and under poured liquor. So much potential here, but wasted. Can be fun to party at but usually gets too crowded."}
{"text":"Cool pub-like atmosphere with a slight lounge feel. The half order of lamb came with a decent side salad which was all a steal for $9 and pretty tasty, though the sauce was very sweet. Zucchini salad was a cool idea but not much in flavor. Tried the brussels, mac, beet falafel and all was okay tasting but beautiful in presentation. Reasonable prices for tapas. Bottle of bubbly Grigio for $15, steal. The food is a solid three (though my dining companions would rate it higher), but the value, ingenuity, service, and atmosphere would make it worth another try."}
{"text":"Just mediocre. Not much on menu choices.  The ambiance of a very old irish pub is kind of cool.  Hear they have a great banquet room upstairs."}
{"text":"Two words: green beans. Amazing! The Spinach dip is also amazing, just wish it came with a bit more bread to dip. Great atmosphere and I really like the historic aspect. The plates are small, but my boyfriend and I ordered 3 plates and it was plenty to share. They have a DJ after hours upstairs, lots of fun."}
{"text":"Great small plates, macaroni and cheese wings mashed potato croquettes. Service was exceptional sat at the upstairs bar. At one point had all 3 bartenders within a few minutes of each other, ask if I needed another drink when I finished. What s nice change most places on a busy Friday night, you could die at the bar and no one would notice. Also had a nice vibe how can you go wrong with exposed brick and wood!  Will definitely be back can't wait to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Came here for a Bloody Mary after brunch as we went to brunch before noon somewhere else. They have a Bloody Mary bar set up with everything you could want. I loved it. Our bartender also gave us biscuits to eat with sides of apple butter and jam even though we were just there to get a drink. It was pretty busy but we were able to get seats at the bar easily. Our bartender was very friendly and attentive. The dinner and brunch menus both looked so good that I will definitely be back to try their food and I look forward to it! Would recommend making reservations though because I did try to come here for dinner one night and they were full."}
{"text":"We didn't try to come here! We went to Ashbury first and were quoted a long wait time, so asked what other options were in the area and they directed us to dandelion market and O.M.G. I am so happy we were!! Food is amazing, mimosas are fantastic, service is great and we love the atmosphere! This place is to die for! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Bloody mary bar - first I've ever seen something like that. We had one of the omlettes that were a bit dry. Very cool location - near Thai Basil. Natural-oriented choices... a little different breakfast place."}
{"text":"Love eating tapas, I get bored with a huge plate full of the same thing.  We liked everything we had, but especially the shrimp and grits and mac and cheese.  But for me its the perfect combo of atmosphere and food.  Cool, laid back and dark for a night out, and the upstairs turns into a dance floor on weekends.  Love it!"}
{"text":"We liked the space, all old wood and exposed brick. The first off-putting thing was the hostess, who seemed out of it when we arrived and didn't fully engage us, no biggie but for a place that I thought was supposed to be a little extra nice, or even cool, this is a small ding. We sat upstairs and again, it's a great space. Was 7ish on Saturday night and wasn't that busy. We ordered the roasted olives, deconstructed caprese, portabella fries, ahi and steak skewers. The olives were good and lot's of them; nice to have on the table for the rest of the meal. The fries came out next and were really tasty, the homemade ketchup is awesome, I think they were fried with panko crumbs, was reminiscent of tempura. The caprese was a letdown; the fried balls of mozz really masked the flavor of the cheese and there were only small bits of basil on the tomatoes. Overall an experiment gone wrong with a classic appetizer and one that we in particular love. Ahi tuna was done perfectly, complaint here being the wasabi sauce does not have enought wasabi; not enough heat. Steak skewers were tasty, korean style. We asked about dessert and were disappointed to find no chocolate representation aside from chocolate ice cream. Chocoholics beware. Overall the food was good but not great. I had high expectations after having heard many great things from friends. Another thing that really bothered me was that as small plate after small plate kept coming out, none were cleared from our table. We had to pile them up ourselves. What's up with that? A perfectly fine place, several other dishes I would like to try. Still not a breakthrough restaurant for Charlotte."}
{"text":"American Fusion Tapas. Rustic, dark, restaurant with friendly service.  Definitely order: *Shrimp & Grits (9) - not to tomatoey, the grits was a polenta cake, best tapa *Sweet & Spicy Green Beans (7) - Szechuan sauce, macadamia nuts, slighly sweet and spicy, great crunch *Sweet Potato Gnocchi (8.5) - great texture and sweet potato flavor *Meatballs Marinara (9) - very lean meat, great tapa! *Pan Seared Scallops (17) - the collard greens were great while the pineapple was an interesting topping, perfectly cooked scallop  Try at your own discretion: *Prosciutto Crostinis (9) - more of a baguette than a crostini, came out soggy and heavy *Cured Meat & Cheese Board (14) - average board with 3 meats, 3 cheeses, baguette, honey comb, blackberry jam, spicy mustard *Arugula Salad (10) - spiced watermelon, cornbread croutons, feta, lemon vinaigrette, very light and the flavors are untouched *Zucchini Pasta (8) -spiral zucchini, pickled beets, pumpkin seeds, basil, smoked tomato vinaigrette, if you get the meatballs, that marinara makes this a lot better, cold pasta, wasn't memorable  Wasn't a fan of having to trek upstairs to be seated when the downstairs area had availability. Friendly service. Twinkle toes ($10) cranberry prosecco was good. Clean bathroom. There are plenty of tapas restaurants in Charlotte and Dandelion Market features fusion flavors like the green beans and the scallops but does a great job maintaining core flavors too - like the meatballs and arugula salad.  Stop by if you're not too adventurous or if you have a big group that wants to try it all for $295!"}
{"text":"OMG.  Amazing combinations of flavors.  The shrimp n grits is to die for w the perfect mix of spicy red pepper cream sauce tempered with the goat cheese dollop.  And never thought green beans could be so good when they combine the szechuan spicy w crushed macadamia nuts. Top it off with the browny Sunday and 5  doesn't say enough."}
{"text":"Really great place for lunch or dinner. Staff is very friendly and the ambiance/ decor is really cute. Also a great spot to stop by for a few drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and plain&simple, food = great and ambiance = eh. It's inside of a dark bar with no outdoor seating and tables closely packed. However, the breakfast menu was great with multiple options, a whole bloody mary bar, and warm buscuits served before the meal. I would say it's the best brunch place i've visited in Uptown in terms of food, but other options like 5Church have more of a comfortable and open setting. I also felt the menu was a bit pricey, but if you're interested in options like the Chesapeake omelette with crab and shrimp, then it's worth the extra change."}
{"text":"Brought a group of 13 to Dandelion on Friday night and had an absolutely amazing experience. They put us at a huge table upstairs and we ordered \"The Whole Market\" which is everything on the small plates menu. By the end of it we were so full we couldn't eat another bite! Everyone told me what a great choice of restaurants I had made and how much they enjoyed every single dish. The Lollipops stood out along with the Ahi Tuna, Calamari, and Sweet Potato Gnocchi......Service was outstanding as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for a long time.  We love you long time, Dandelion Market.  We just came here for our 16th anniversary!  I know, big spender.  I even wore my jeans from 2005, not the 90's beauties she's been trying to throw away.   It's a good joint.  Location is perfect and has a great vibe.  Lighting and bar are great.  Food is always consultant, even if you don't like the selection, it's at the top of its game."}
{"text":"I went here while on a business trip in Charlotte. I had heard from the locals that they had a good brunch and a bloody mary bar, so I trekked up there on my own on a Sunday afternoon. After debating the menu for a while  I ordered the Prosciutto Benny. I wish I could have ordered like four things because they all looked good, but eventually I went with the Prosciutto based on a Yelp recommendation. I was not disappointed.  The ambiance was almost like modern Tavern or bed and breakfast in the city. Very cozy with wooden floors. Not very crowded when I went. Oh.....and while I wasn't able to enjoy the Bloody Mary bar that day it had my mouth watering the whole time. Self-serve style with the toppings and pretty much every topping you can imagine including cold prawns for an extra couple bucks. Drinks looked reasonably priced too.  Great place for brunch, especially with a group of friends who like to have a good time. Casual. Be prepared to tap a DD or taxi if you plan on hitting the Bloody Mary bar. Things could get crazy. I hear it turns in to a crowded hot spot on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here with friends last weekend. The wine is reasonably priced, as is the food. The tapas menu is perfect for dining with friends as it allows everyone to try lots of things on the menu.   We finished up right at 10, which is good since that's when the upstairs apparently turns unto a club and is super loud. I'll definitely go back again for dinner."}
{"text":"Service was good Got the Brussels sprouts lamb lollipops and seared ahi tuna. All were good. Great selection of wine and craft beers. Casual low key spot."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely incredible.  For 300 dollars you can order the entire menu...which we considered but instead ordered 18 menu items for our party of six...plus 3 desserts.  Everything was really good.  Dont miss the sliders, green beans and potato croquets.  The stuffed pepper was the only item no one liked.  It tasted like a bagel bite. The desserts were all good, but the Apple Ravioli was the best by far.  Btw...Even though dinner is tapas..desserts are full size.   I highly recommend Dandelion Market for groups of friends.  I cant wait to go back. And try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Favorite small plates restaurant in town! Everything is delicious. Personal favorite is the Southern Caprese Salad."}
{"text":"I have only been to Dandelion Market for only drinks and dancing. I will need to try it out for dinner. It is your typically bar on a Saturday night but with more bumping and grinding. The music is a lot of rap and dub step so i'm not a huge fan of it. The upstairs gets really crowded and it can be hard to move around a lot. I don't know if this is every Saturday but last time i was there girls didn't have to pay cover so that's always a bonus. This is a place that i wouldn't necessarily choice to go to but i won't complained if i get dragged there."}
{"text":"I must say I was pretty impressed with the wings and fries I've had. The fries were really crisp and the wings were smokey with a great char.   The beer selection isn't bad but I've come to realize these southern breweries just can't do IPAs well."}
{"text":"So Ive been to Dandelion twice to eat and all in all had a fairly good experience (solid 3.5 stars)   The first was for Brunch where I had a yummy Bellini and the Torta Rustica. The Torta is HUGE and is certainly a sight to behold. The cold cuts were fresh and the bread was tasty and crusty. The star of the show was definitely the French Fries...wow they were good!   The second time I came for a late night appetizer and settled on the Calamari. Instead of the usual cocktail or marinara sauce they were served with a Lemon Garlic Aioli. At first I really enjoyed the Aioli but it did become too much so I had to ask for the Marinara. I did not enjoy the Marinara at all unfortunately. The Calamari were fairly small rings and were overly salted. I would not recommend these as a meal for one - it was a bit too much especially with the salt content.  I will say the atmosphere day or night is great ! The  prices are very reasonable as well ( $7 for calamari $8 for Torta).   Overall I plan on returning to try some other things"}
{"text":"Visited recently for a bachelorette party and was not disappointed. Food and service (thanks, Jeff) were excellent. I highly recommend the Prosciutto Crostini, Fried Calamari, Fruit and Nut Salad, Southern Caprese, and Pan Seared Scallops. I don't care for sage, but everyone who ordered the Sweet Potato Gnocchi seemed to enjoy it. Mucho Gusto cocktail and Lemon Pound Cake shot were delicious.   Shrimp and grits were lacking (grits are fried) and the mac and cheese was too smoky (think ashtray). Other than that, definitely looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I walked down to Dandelion Market for lunch on a weekday. for some reason, the upstairs dining room was not open this day so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to be seated. One of my employees was pregnant and in her third trimester so she was not able to stand for too long. Luckily for us, they had two comfy leather chairs in the dining area for her sit while we waited. The service took a little longer than you would expect for lunch. Everyone ordered a lunch combo or a salad. The sandwiches were large and looked delicious. I ordered the market salad $6 and added ahi tuna $6. It was one of the best salads I have ever had. They lightly toss it with a vinaigrette and I love goat cheese, dried cranberries, pine nuts, spring mix and of course, ahi tuna! The best salad ever! Everyone enjoyed their meal immensely."}
{"text":"Dandelion market was a fun experience ! I went here with a group of about 25 people from work and they have a large enough space to accommodate multiple large groups/parties at once. The menu is tapas/small plates so kinda designed to share. I tried the mediterranean trio, szechuan string beans, sweet potato gnocchi, black bean sliders along with tiramisu, apple cheesecake and the brownie sundae. The only things I was disappointed with was the dessert menu, and ofcourse the desserts themselves. Shouldn't it be very hard to mess up a simple classic chocolate brownie? Well, theirs was hard and a little bland. The tiramisu was more whipped cream than anything, very very sweet and with hardy any coffee flavor. The cheesecake I liked! All the savory dishes we ordered were delicious too - my fav being the sweet potato gnocchi. This was HEAVENLY! You only get a couple pieces of gnocchi per serving so beware, because you will get hooked.  I was too excited to talk about the food and now that I have it out in the open, I will proceed to say that we got excellent service. Our server was very sweet and helpful and attentive even though we were a large group and clearly not very easy to manage. They have wooden interiors that impart a very intimate, cozy feeling to the restaurant. Love it!  Did I mention they have a kickass cocktails menu? :)"}
{"text":"This place is a fun spot at night but a little overpriced for food. The food is mostly tappas and although not bad, it's nothing special for the price. The place turns into a giant dance club upstairs on the weekends but still has the downstairs as a chill sport for those not interested in the big crowd."}
{"text":"Love their brunch on Sundays! Always have great service and on Monday nights they have a special on draft beers. I love the upstairs bar...so spacious and the ambience is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my dinner with a friend here. Cool atmosphere and Jeff gave great service! I had the wings and shared brussel sprouts and green beans. Both of the vegetables had great flavor!! I really enjoyed the wings as well. Thought it was still a little pricey for the amount of food-- but thats to be expected with small plates. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. This was my first time here & my friend & I enjoyed each plate that we ordered. It's a small plates restaurant that has a great variety of options. The Roasted Garlic Hummus is so good, & so is the Stuffed Poblano Pepper."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here for brunch over the weekend. We were told that there would be a wait of about 20 min, but we got seated in 10 min. The service is very friendly and efficient. I ordered the Low Country Hash without the eggs, and my boyfriend ordered the Migas. They were both decent after adding some salt and hot sauce... Greasy, but decent. The atmosphere here is a little weird for a brunch place. It's dark and dingy inside, like a bar (which I understand it is), but I like brunch places to be more lit up with natural lighting and larger windows, because, duh, it should brighten you up after a lazy morning! Also, any time someone opened the door to enter or leave, there was a gust of cold air that blew right in, and it was 30F outside! At one point, the hostess held the door open for a good amount of time, for a group of people descending down the stairs. Like, is that chivalry really necessary? And if it is, can't you just open the door for them when they get to it, instead of holding it open while they are 20 feet away as the other diners get frozen to their bones? I believe the second floor might be nicer, but that's not where they seated us so that's that. Also, what kind of a brunch place does not carry anything other than whole milk? No 2%, no skim, not even soy milk! So, overall, my experience was just meh. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite tapas bar. My favorite thing on the menu is the calamari! Big and juicy. Breading is so light. The lemon aioli sauce is on point. I've tried the beef sticks and they were ok. Crab cakes were good but small. Macaroni and cheese wasn't that great. They were almost too smoky. It smelled and tasted like cigarettes. My fiancé tried the lamb and he loved it. Hamburgers were also good and filling! Atmosphere is nice and dark."}
{"text":"Do not even try! I have never been treated more rudely in my entirely life. The staff is completely disgusting. Absolutely avoid this place! Can't believe I have to even gove one star because it's an absolute zero from all of us."}
{"text":"cosy rustic spot. wooden shoes and modern paintings line the walls.   extensive beer selection. i am a beer girl (ipa being my favorite vairetal). and hailing from california, was very very very HAPPY to see stone's arrogant bastard ON TAP.   great place for groups of 2-6, apps, and craft brew. order the antipasti board and the jalapeno poppers (these are not fried, my friends, baked and oh. so. good.)"}
{"text":"Small plate restaurants are dangerous. I want it all, order it all, and always join the clean plate club.   Our first time here, super enjoyed it. Service was relatively fast and attentive. The plates come out in no order so don't be a picky pants about that.  We had the beet salad (more salad than beet but good), southern caprese (fried green tomatoes and mozzarella-so good we ordered a second helping), tuna crudo, scallops (perfectly seared but you get 3 so there could be a fork injury with 2 diners), Brussels sprouts (pretty good but not as good as Tupelo Honey), green beans (holy smokes they were killer).   Wished we had saved room for dessert but we will be back."}
{"text":"We had our 30th bday party here last night  and the service was awesome.  Our reservation was at 8 but we didn't get seated until 8:40 (everyone was hungry and somewhat upset) but the servers and maybe manager took really good care of us. I understand you can't predict when table is going to leave even after paying their tab. They (server, manager, bartenders, and host) all did an amazing job in making sure we walked out happy."}
{"text":"I wanted this to be good so bad! The menu  items looked amazing but the dishes were hit & miss. This place was LOUD! Trying to have a conversation was almost impossible!  The service was not good. We had a table of six & our server took an order for 2 ( SMALL ) plates & didn't return to take orders for more for nearly 15 minutes when we initially wanted to order 6 plates. She just kinda took the order for 2 & left. The fried pickles & the zucchini ribbon pasta were excellent!  The black bean sliders should have gone back! They were pasty & flavorless. The crab & avocado was in desperate need of salt & the sauce did not complement well. The fried green tomatoes were also in disparate need of salt & the breading was too heavy. The shrimp & grits were very good! The pumpkin cheesecake was delicious except the oatmeal cookie crust was so think and hard I literally have to hammer it with my spoon to brake it up in order to eat.  The Long Island drink was not the worst but nothing to rave about either."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte and came across this place in our brunch search. Delicious food at a reasonable price. Cute, relaxed atmosphere and awesome Bloody Mary bar. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So, first of all, a couple of disclaimers: 1. My only experience with Dandelion Market was on a Saturday night.  2. I am not from Charlotte, so therefore not familiar with the best places to go or neighborhoods to seek out my kind of scene.  3. I do not do well in homogeneous environments.   So yeah, I didn't like this place. On the night I was there, it was disgustingly packed. As in, can't turn around, have to elbow people, feel really bad for the short people, feeling claustrophobic kind of crowded. It was insanely uncomfortable, especially because the crowd looked so... Stepford. If J. Crew doesn't make up the majority of your closet, don't expect to find your kind of crowd here. Just so you know.   Nothing they can do about that, I feel like it pervades most of Charlotte, but they *can* control the crowds. Even when we went downstairs we found ourselves standing in the entryway just for a little bit of breathing room.   They've got a fine beer list but when I asked for a second Two Hearted Ale they made a big deal about changing out the kegs and then proceeded to totally forget about me. I had to flag down another bartender after waiting for 10 minutes, and he poured me one straight up. Not sure what it is about this place that draws in such a large percentage of the city's population, but I think it's safe to say that I don't get it."}
{"text":"Great wine list and selection of local craft beers. Definitely has the feel of quaint places you would see in San Francisco and New York. The downstairs area feels much more warm and hip then the upstairs. Our most favorite visits have actually been sitting at the bar. The small plates are a perfect compliment to an after work cocktail. Fun spot!"}
{"text":"Dandelion is a great place to grab a casual bite to eat or get some drinks. With the tapas style setup, I really like to come here with a plan to share plates.   In our two visits, my girlfriend and my favorite plates would have to be the lamb lollipops, brussell sprouts, and most of all the sweet potato gnocchi! The lamb lollipops are tender and come with a nice arugula salad with feta cheese and a tasty vinaigrette. Both of us have never liked brussell sprouts, but we decided to give it a shot based on our waiter's strong recommendation last visit. I have to say, try them! They have bacon and sweet golden beets that overcome the brussell sprout taste and make the dish surprisingly delicious. Lastly, the sweet potato gnocchi... I have dreams about those puffy clouds of sweet potatoes covered in whatever is in the amazing sage brown butter sauce. I would eat these every single day if I could!  The servers have been very friendly and seem very laid back. The prices are a little high for the amount of food you get (as with just about every tapas style restaurant), but the quality is worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"We LOVE Dandelion Market! It's become a practically weekly date night spot for my boyfriend and I! He's obsessed with the ahi tuna...so obsessed he eats two plates of it alone. The steak skewers are amazing and always cooked perfectly. My go to dishes are the sweet potato gnocchi and the sweet and spicy green beans. Literally no complaints! Tonight with the Yelp restaurant week discount we tried the prosciutto crostinis and as expected...so good!! The service is always great here too! And on the weekends you can dance here at night. Overall great spot!"}
{"text":"Oooohhh cozy! That's exactly how I felt when I rolled into Dandelion Market last night.   Dandelion Market is one of those comfy, yet minimalist, bars that can certainly appeal to a variety of peeps. I'm a big fan of the exposed brick and duct work engulfing the restaurant. Upstairs, Dandelion Market provides a beautiful and expansive space for even more drinking, eating and general hanging out opportunities.   But let's get down to where they really shine - their beer offerings. While I'm not a beer gal, I was more than delighted with the Carolina Strawberry Ale, brewed just north of Charlotte in Mooresville. A hoppy mixture that twisted my taste buds with a strawberry effervescence. While it was probably \"chick beer\", I definitely appreciated the local love.   That's the great thing about Dandelion Market's beer selection - a fair amount of them are local. Hooray!   The service here was just great. Every bartender and server, on both the downstairs and upstairs levels, was just super friendly and laid back. It's the kind of place where you want everybody to know your name - and they definitely deliver.  I didn't get a chance to sample any eats here, but I look forward to coming back, grabbing a chick beer, listening to (another) great acoustic musician and relaxing in the market."}
{"text":"We were very impressed by the food and service.   As foodies I feel like we are picky, and this was awesome!"}
{"text":"Brunch, lunch, dinner, date night, girls night, special occasions, happy hour, dancing, blackout drunk- seriously, this place covers it all and does it right.   Dando features a tapas style dinner menu. I always order the stuffed poblano pepper. The lamb lollipops are another favorite. Honestly, I think I've had everything. Shrimp & grits, sweet & spicy green beans, fried pickles- depending on your mood, I don't really think you can go wrong. You can order \"Everything at the Market\" for $295. For lunch, I always get the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It's perfection. Love their brunch- several egg bennie options, hangover hash, bloody mary bar ($7). Pro tip: make sure to ask about the quiche of the day!  Hours wise: dinner 7 days a week from 4-11pm, lunch Monday-Friday 11am-3pm, brunch Saturday-Sunday 10am-3pm. Bar is open until 2am. Couple dozen craft beers on draft and 25 wines for $25 a bottle.  After dinner, they pull the big community table upstairs up off the floor and up to the ceiling. Pretty cool. Great night spot for dancing. Even more importantly, it's an even better place for people watching. Enjoy.   Great staff here, the service is always top notch. With so many new places that continue to pop up in Charlotte and uptown, Dandelion is still a go-to spot for my friends and I."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I like the cozy, dimly lit atmosphere, the food is excellent with a great variety, they serve small plates/tapas for sharing. Also the wine list is great, I got a red wine from Montepulciano, Italy and it was amazing!!! You have to come here!"}
{"text":"Having previously only been here after 11pm, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Dandelion Market doubles as a fantastic brunch spot.  Because of my aforementioned experience drinking there, I had to do boozy brunch. The bartender made an excellent Bloody Mary that actually had a good kick to it. It paired excellently with the Migas, which you must get!! It's a banging egg scramble served in a skillet with tortillas on the side. The combination of the Latino-flavored dish and the spicy drink was fabulous.  Not only were the food and drinks awesome, they were wonderfully priced as well. Dandelion's menu rivals chain prices for brunch and delivers high quality. I will definitely start coming here more for food!"}
{"text":"Great spot! I've been here twice and split about 10 dishes with people. Everything has been delicious and they also have a great local beer selection!"}
{"text":"Dandelion is an unusual place, I didn't try the food at dandy until after a dozen times of going there, mostly because I frequent this place late at nights, on weekends where It serves as one of the places to be in Charlotte if you're looking for a good time...but the food is surprisingly great, a solid brunch spot as well."}
{"text":"Loved this little place when we were last in Charlotte.  We grabbed an early dinner of small plates while we were walking through the Fourth Ward.  Everything we ordered was delicious, and our server was knowledgeable and friendly.  I'll definitely make a point to come back.  Although we loved everything, here's a breakdown on each dish: The Southern Caprese = heavenly.  CC said this mozzarella is what all mozzarella wishes it could be.  This unique twist on a caprese is what every caprese wishes it could be. Tuna Tartare - succulent tuna, with a nice bite Sauteed Scallops - perfectly cooked, tender.  The macadamia nuts make a nice variation of texture. Prosciutto Crostini - the flavors blended together perfectly Mac n' cheese - delicious, smoky flavor.  However, with how out-of-this-world most of the other dishes were, it falls a little lower on my list."}
{"text":"This place was really great. It's exactly what it looks like. Great tapas sized plates of food and a bar. The people were really friendly and the service was good. The food is great tasting and served hot. It's a low key relaxed place. Food is very rich and yummy."}
{"text":"When I walked into this place, the atmosphere of the restaurant definitely didn't strike me as a dandelion market. The restaurant is dark and has these very old style decorations. It's a cool place nonetheless.   We were seated at table with bar stools because they had quite a few large groups taking up some of the tables and this was the only option available. You can order your own or share a few to share. The portions are small so I recommend ordering about two if you're having a meal.  I ordered the baked potato croquettes and grilled steak skewers and got to try some of pan seared ahi tuna, dando brussel sprouts, meatballs marinara, and sweet potato gnocchi. I enjoyed the potato croquettes and grilled steak skewers. The croquettes were fried perfectly, crispy on the outside and the potatoes insides weren't clumpy and paired well with the dip. The skewers were a lot more tender than I thought they would come out, which was great. The ahi tuna was good, but it didn't stand out to me as anything exceptional. The brussel sprouts were fine, but I think they would be better if they were crispy. They felt a bit soggy. I also thought the meatballs and gnocchi were just A-OK.  Overall, food was decent, service was good, and atmosphere was unique."}
{"text":"Becoming a bar with a dance floor upstairs, this place has severely discriminatory and homosexist policies. Because I am a male, I was charged a separate entrance fee as my female counterparts. After calling the policy homosexist and discriminatory, I was told to leave and told I was \"being an asshole\" by both the bouncer and doorwoman.   Nothing special with this bar unless your scene is discriminatory homosexism. Avoid!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely AMAZING.   Calamari and spicy green beans are two of my favs.   Dislikes about this place: the drinks are priced more than apps. And the drinks are not that crafty or tasty.   I'm usually never one to complain about service, but our server literally mocked one of my best friends and it was extremely rude. Especially for it to be the day after Christmas.   Besides that, my visits here have been extraordinary from food, to drinks and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Been going to the bar here for about two years, but this past weekend was the first time I visited for food.  It was a birthday dinner and I was with about ten other ladies, they were extremely attentive and the food came out very quickly.  We all ordered something different and passed each dish around the table for everyone to try.  This was also my birthday dinner, and they gave me a delicious heavenly piece of chocolate cake.  Ill definitely return, hopefully for brunch because I've heard that there brunch is the best part about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Got 4 plates. Each one was the bomb. Awesome variety of options without having a novel of a menu or sacrificing quality. Great atmosphere and service without being crazy expensive.   This is a place I could go to any day of the week."}
{"text":"Came to Charlotte for work and ate dinner here by myself. Nice ambience, cozy. It was interesting to have American tapas as I usually go to Spanish tapas restaurants. Limited healthy food options so I ordered the \"healthiest\" yet also tasty-sounding items on the menu:  - Half order (comes with 2) of the Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops- medium rare, dark sweet Cherries, spring mix, feta, red wine vinaigrette - Zucchini Lasagna- raw zucchini, heirloom tomatoes, sun dried tomato pesto, basil pesto, macadamia nut pesto   The lamb was cooked perfectly, but was not a fan of the cherry glaze. It's too sweet and candied, almost medicinal tasting. But if you don't eat the cherries or dip the lamb into the sauce, it still tastes good.   The zucchini lasagna was fresh tasting and flavorful. Keep in mind it is a cold dish so the zucchini has a super raw crunch and taste."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in uptown! I hosted at least 10 dinners in this place and tried almost everything on their menu. Almost nothing disappoints me.  One thing to note: if you truly want the Dandelion experience, come for their dinner menu!   Highly recommend: Steak skewers  Sweet potato gnocchi  Mac & Cheese Ahi Tuna"}
{"text":"Dandelion Market is a great place for a late night \"we're kinda hungry but not for a whole meal\". We ordered 4 tapas plates: steak sqwers, mac n cheese, turkey meatballs, & calamari.   The steak was so tender and delicious! Calamari and mac n cheese were phenomenal! However, I'm not too sure if the turkey meatballs were fully cooked. They still seemed soft in the center.   Overall, the ambiance is great & I would recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for a couple drinks and some small plates to share while visiting Uptown over Labor Day weekend. We were seated upstairs in a booth across from the bar, near the bathrooms. Our waiter was nice, and when we told him we were from out of town he gave us recommendations for what to try both there and around the city (little did we know at that time that throughout the rest of the vacation, everyone else we talked to would recommend Dandelion Market!!!). The beer list was creative with \"Tourists on Tap\" and \"Rotating Locals.\" We each ordered a beer as well as prosciutto crostinis, a mozzarella & pesto flatbread, and chorizo fundido. Everything came out beautifully. The flatbread was crispy, but not burnt. We actually enjoyed dipping the flatbread into the fundido! The fundido didn't have enough of those brown, crunchy chips, so it worked out perfect with the flatbread. I loved the bits of picked onion and chorizo mixed into the creamy queso. The crostinis were topped with prosciutto, goat cheese, fig preserves, caramelized onions, and a balsamic glaze. You really can't go wrong with prosciutto, but Dandelion Market definitely went above and beyond with this flavor combo! It was salty, with a slight sweetness from the preserves. It was crispy, but soft because of the goat cheese! Very enjoyable and highly recommend. Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"A local friend brought us here saying it was her favorite. I loved the sophisticated, yet casual atmosphere. The server recommended 3 tapas per person, which would have been waaaaaaaaaaaay too much, so I'm glad our group started with one each, which was plenty with drinks. Each dish was unique and totally yummy."}
{"text":"By far the most stellar place I ate on my first trip to Charlotte. My best friend told me it was her favorite place, and boy was she right! From the rustic decor to the way they serve their espresso, everything was spot on.  We shared everything, of course, but a few of the super standouts were the LAMB -- omg some of the most tender and flavorful lamb I've ever had.  Their Brussels with golden beets and bacon is phenomenal -- as well as the red beet falafel!! The trio of fall Creme brûlée was wonderful as well.  And the fact that all of their wine bottles are only 25$ is awesome! I will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"It's the go-to bar after work.  Can't complain as it has friendly staff, solid bar food, nice selection of beers.  Came here to celebrate many things, one being the second time I had to take the MPRE bc North Carolina is so tight about requirements for out-of-state attorneys! All good, gave me a chance to catch up on beers and convo with work buds.    Only thing I don't like is the awkward ceiling support bars attached to some tables that are designed for 6 people to sit.  When I take out my wallet, phone (4s, sorry, I love it), keys, gum, eye drops, watch, cigarettes, headphones... I find my space limited! JK on the last 6 items, but still, it's a little tight.  Nothing they can really do about it I guess.   It's a nice after-work bar, came in on the day of the Taylor Swift concert but there were no attendees in attendance at that particular bar - shoulda headed over to Epicentre.  Regardless, had a great time there.  dmo out."}
{"text":"This place blew me away. I really enjoy comfortable, dark pubs & not only was it comfortable, but it was romantic as well. The flowers & dim candle light make for an excellent casual date night.   The food. Oh my gosh! I & my boyfriend were in heaven. The Lamb Pops with the cherry sauce was like crack topped with sprinkles. (I've never smoked crack, but you get the point) Even something as simple as green beans is taken to a whole new delicious level at the DM. (It goes down in the DM ;) ) Our service was excellent! She really went above & beyond to make our evening special.I love when places leave the cute pitchers of water on the table, because we drink A TON of water.   It's within walking distance to the Knights Stadium. A suggestion to the fellas: Take your girl to a Knights game, afterwards treat her to casual yet amazing dinner at the Dandelion Market. You will be super glad you took my advice."}
{"text":"The waitstaff was knowledgeable about their gluten free options,  the bartender was attentive and quick with great conversation, and the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"So I have to share my experience here at Dandelions! It's phenomenal! I've been here three times in the past week and a half and can say I've had a five star experience every time. Being an extremely critical person of the restaurant business, having experience in it, I can say Dandelion Market exceeded all expectations I have for a restaurant. Friendly environment and ambience, great service, great unique cocktails, and AMAZING FOOD! I've had great service from waitresses such as Sam, and great educated bartenders such as Kenny!  Keep up the great work guys, you can now add another regular to your list!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch and Sunday bunch!  Dandelion has a cool decor with wood floors, high ceilings, and two levels of dining.  I can't forget to mention that they also play awesome music.    Both levels have comfortable seating, and the noise level is low during breakfast and lunch.  I expect it's worse during happy hour due to the ceilings.  Their staff are very friendly and welcoming, service is usually fast and efficient, and their food keeps me coming back again and again.  I've been here many times for lunch, and while their flatbreads and salads are good, I've found my favorite dish in their grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Wow - it's yummy, AND so reasonably priced!  I've never had a better grilled cheese/soup combo anywhere else...it's that good!  My hubby and I recently ventured here for Sunday brunch, and we really enjoyed our meal.  To start, their coffee is good and strong, and they serve biscuits and corn muffins with butter, honey, and jelly while you wait.  The biscuits are small and slightly crispy.  I loved them.  The corn muffins needed a bit of salt, however.   There are lots of options for breakfast, but we tried the huevos rancheros (hubby) and ham/gruyere omelet (me).  Both were very good!  The huevos was served in a cast iron skillet with shredded steak, beans, corn, and a spicy sauce; it came with tortillas, pico, and sour cream on the side.  The huevos was topped with a fried egg (over-easy on the menu, but they gladly gave my hubby one that was over-medium).  We love Mexican food for breakfast, and my hubby enjoyed their unique version.    My ham/gruyere omelet was light and fluffy, with just the right amount of filling.  I chose grits as my side, topped with shredded Parmesan.  The grits had some kick to them (maybe white pepper?), and I really liked their flavor.    I highly recommend Dandelion for lunch or brunch!  And we plan to try them for dinner as well, since that's the only meal we haven't yet had there."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. My go-to place for a casual dinner and for happy hour. My favorites are the tuna (large portion and always great) and the stuffed zucchini.   The bartenders and servers are attentive and friendly. They make an effort to learn names and greet us personally every time now."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food was excellent. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is because the service wasn't great. Our waitress was very nice and good, but the kitchen and bar weren't getting our drinks or food out. That aside, it was a great night and I will most definitely be back sooner than later. What we ordered-  Flat bread Scallops  Mac and Cheese Fried potato ball of some sort. We re-ordered it because it was sooo good."}
{"text":"I never reviewed this place yet?! Everybody knows this place is like the little restaurant downstairs with a party upstairs. Not too fancy, not too dirty. Birthday parties, casual dinners, drinks with friends... Pretty much everything doable here. Not a bad place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place even though expensive. There was not one dish I didn't enjoy and liked I could try a bunch of different things. My favorites were the chorizo pepper, fried pickles, Mac and cheese, crustinis  and the southern caprese. We also tried the sliders, artichoke dip, chile steak, and the lamb. Really the only thing I would not order again are the sliders and the steak, they were good but nothing out of the ordinary. We also got the salted caramel brownie for dessert. This is the only thing that's not a small portion, it came with two pretty large brownies and ice cream, was very yummy. The server was nice and didn't have to wait long for anything even though 6 on a Saturday night. I plan to come back again."}
{"text":"Dandelion is one of my favourite places uptown, food is good and I always go for tapas style. They update the menu often and that keeps it interesting, also on the weekend the upstairs part become a club so the atmosphere is very cool."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed with this place.    Good beer selection, I had a porter and it's just right.    The southern caprese was as good as other reviews have indicated.  The shrimp and grits was the perfect amount, although slightly too much heat for me.  The goat cheese topping the grits made it tolerable for me.  The grand finale for me was the lamp lollipops, the only thing I thought a tad disappointing was the lamb was not medium rare, but still very tender at medium done.  My server was so nice she asked the kitchen to re-make it!  I originally wanted to give this place a 4 star but it deserves a 5 star because they care!  I posted before and after so you be the judge of it."}
{"text":"The scallops are so good!  We had the surf and turf as well as the butter fried scallops -- so good!!  The crab and avocado salad was delicious, too.  I was not a fan of the caprese salad or the shrimp and grits, but then again, I'm not a southerner."}
{"text":"I've been to Dandelion Market for lunch 2-3x and for brunch once and have never been disappointed but I was blown away at their dinner. The tapas were perfect portions for sharing and there was nothing we ordered that wasn't delicious. The price was extremely fair as well. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I love the calamari, it is perfectly cooked...crisp and a touch of spice! Most everything that I've tried was good.  It gets very busy on weekends, so go early. Service is always good.  Can't wait to get back!!"}
{"text":"Good share tapas plates. Great location. Decent prices. Good drink options. Inconsistency with food however"}
{"text":"So lucky to end up here my first night in Charlotte. Food is phenomenal - recommend Cherry lamb lollipops & Mac & cheese (amazing but super filling). Had to go back my second night in town (convinced there can't be better food in Charlotte). Calamari was awesome!  Brian the bartender deserves a raise! Amazing service!"}
{"text":"I kinda have a secret crush on this place, and it was randomly reinforced the other day by a killer, killer sammich. Its memory makes me want to write it a poem. But I suck at rhyming, so  The bun - perfectly toasted. A thin, sturdy layer of crust and charred onion giving way to sweet wheatiness, another layer of thin crunch sidling up to a ginormous, ridiculous, muffin topping, butter-saturated, smokey, fungusy portabella cap. A little bit of salt. A dash of balsamic. Pepper. A dollop of goat cheese and chopped tomato placed dead center, a teetery, balanced handful of bitey greens, most or all arugula, then another toasty onioncrunchbun, squashed every-so-slightly on top and skewered in place. Cheese as punctuation, not paragraph. A superb portoburger.  For 8 bucks. Add another giant fistful of delicately dressed greens between the two immaculately sliced sandwich halves, and I was in awe of what a mere 8 bones can get you for lunch.   I gotta come here more often."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have had a great experience every time.  The food is very tasty and well priced. Also, it is pretty cool that you can have a lot of variety for dinner since meals are tapas style.  The place is pretty big since there are two floors.  IMO downstairs is nicer since it is a little more intimate.  Regardless of what floor you are on, the staff is great and will guide you through the menue and recommend their favorites based on what you say you like or do not like.  If you want a relaxing fun dinner, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after passing it on my way to 5Church. Glad I decided to stop by instead.  Ordered: -Dando Crab Cakes: 4/5. Typical crab cakes, cooked well, flavorful sauce. 2x cakes served on a bed of leafy greens.  -Grilled Lamb Lollipops: 3.5/5. The lamb lollipops themselves were great, but I was not a huge fan of the sweet, black cherry based jus they were served on. -Surf and Turf: 5/5. Fantastic and definitely my favorite dish of the night. Tender scallops and perfectly cooked pork belly on an absolutely flavorful bed of sauce and pesto.  -Sweet and Spicy Green Beans: 3.5/5. Fairly typical green beans served with a sweet, and very mildly spicy sauce.   I would definitely come back in the future. Great selection of beer too."}
{"text":"Who is giving this 4 stars? Food was worst ever. We had meatball tapa that tasted like they bought them from Costco and dumped prego on top, really bad. Then they served us 2 uncooked Brussels sprout tapas in a row that were completely uncooked.  We also has scallops that were sandy and under cooked.  Good service but but poor food that I would expect to find at Applebee's."}
{"text":"Favorite date spot! From cocktails to brunch to tapas- this place has it ALL. The ambiance is perfect. Cozy yet upbeat. Great menu great service. YAAAAS, DANDELION. YAAAAS."}
{"text":"I love Dandelion!!! This is one of my absolute favorites in Charlotte.  From beer selection to the fantastic menu, it's always on my go to list!  Not to mention the wonderful staff and management are always eager to help.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"The service at Dandelion Market was amazing!! My cousin and I visited yesterday. Nice low key spot! Mac and cheese was surprisingly good! Green beans awesome! Grilled chicken was a little spicy but still tasty.  Great times!    The two of us shared the following: Green beans, Mac and cheese, sliders, fries, and grilled chicken. It was too much food but the leftovers were great the next day.   Sorry forgot to take pics!"}
{"text":"I have but one word for this place....EXCELLENT! We went there for tapas and a couple of drinks on a Friday night. They sat us in the bar upstairs. Dimly lit, but perfect ambience. We ordered the Mediterranean Trio for a starter, then we piled on their delicious small plates: steak skewers, macaroni, frittes, calamari, shrimp and grits, and the star of the meal....the Ahi Tuna! The meal and service were everything you could ask for. They were very attentive to the customers and made sure we had everything we needed. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  We were only in Charlotte for 24 hours and were so glad we chose to eat here!  It was a sleepy Sunday night, but the bartender was super helpful with suggestions for beer and plates.  After we ate, I wanted to kiss the chef.  It was that good.  The staff was excellent and very accommodating.  We started with the spinach, dried cranberry, pine nut and goat cheese salad, it was plenty for two, but because I'm a big fan of goat cheese, I would have liked more of it on top.  Next we had the Shrimp & Grits...Whoa.  Tasty buggers that pack some heat, but combined with the yummy cheesy grits cakes and roasted red pepper sauce, it was a great combo.  We had to order two more grit cakes, they were that addictive.  Next came my personal favorite, the lamb lollipops with greens and cherry sauce.  That is a \"wanna slap yo momma\" food!  Stupendous dish!  Next up was the Flat iron steak with mushrooms and onion straws! which was my dining companion's favorite of the night.  It was tender, flavorful and rich.  I was super full, but we ordered the Car Bomb Cupcake.  I wouldn't get it again.  The frosting was grainy, the cake a little dry and it was a disappointment.  It didn't evoke the classic car bomb flavors.  Parking is on the street where you can find it, free on weekends, or there is a garage nearby.  I would definitely go back if I was in town."}
{"text":"We stopped in for Sunday brunch with friends while in town.  The atmosphere is cool and trendy.  They had a solid bloody mary bar which I indulged in.   A couple of us got benedicts, I got huevos rancheros which was a substantial portion.  My husband got the prosciutto Benedict which was good but a little salty due to the prosciutto. We also ordered the french toast sticks for the table: YUMM! Coated in cinnamon sugar they were very tasty and just a little elevated from the Market Day ones you used to get in grade school.   Overall a good spot for brunch, friendly service and nice vibe!"}
{"text":"I have been here with colleagues several times, and every time we have eaten here, we have had a good experience.  Almost every dish I have had here has been very well prepared and tasty. The portions are definitely more generous than you'd think (or than they tell you)!  Great spot for casual dinner and drinks, not bad for groups as well. A definite Uptown favorite."}
{"text":"Went here for an office event about a month ago.  Service was really great, food was pretty good and ambiance was fine for this type of group event. We initially sat at the communal table on the second floor but ended up migrating to the area under the stairs as it allowed us to network.   The servers were very flexible and kept the drinks flowing. The food was great - simple pub fare but overall well done. Loved the eggplant option, hummus, calamari, wings, and other dishes to share."}
{"text":"I had a dozen girlfriends in town and we decided to go to Dandelion Market for dinner. We were seated upstairs, and the atmosphere was nice- sort of dark, not fancy or anything, but just nice enough.   Since there were so many of us, we decided to order the menu item that includes every single tapas plate on the menu. I honestly think everyone should find a dozen of their closest friends and do exactly this, so that you get to taste everything on the menu instead of having to choose!  The food was absolutely amazing. When the plates started coming out, all of us were getting basically a bite of each plate. And we're looking at each other and thinking \"uh-oh. This is never going to work\". But then some of the plates are coming out where you're getting 2-4 bites. And then, 25 plates later, you're absolutely stuffed with truly fantastic food. The lamb lollipops were amazing, as were the scallops, flatbread pizzas, the cheese board, the mussels (a LOT of mussels!), the steak. I had ZERO complains about the food.  The service was good. I wish there had been a better way of staging the items, because it started off with a slow trickle, and then at one point we were just slammed with plates- there was no way to keep up with them!   I guess the wine list and beer list is good. I don't know. Someone else ordered all of our wine, and I don't get really picky when it comes to fermented grapes.  I would recommend Dandelion to anyone. Personally, I'd have a hard time coming back and only getting to choose a few plates. For around $25 per person (plus booze, of course), I thought the \"try everything\" option couldn't have been better. Will absolutely be coming back, as soon as I wrangle up 10 friends to go with me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined at Dandelion market for Yelp restaurant week. This was my first time having dinner there, and I won't be back.   The restaurant is located in Uptown (so I wouldn't suggest driving here unless you want to pay to park your car and then still have a good ways to walk). On a Monday evening the restaurant was empty, but the ambience was nice. Dandelion is located in a cool older building and boasts historic hardwood floors and dim lighting which is nice for a date night spot.  We liked only 2 of the 7 items we ordered. Additionally at a price tag of about $100 for a couple (including only a couple drinks) this place is not cheap, and there are far better tapas restaurants in Charlotte.   If you care for all the details; we tried a bunch of items: Brussels sprouts: I do not recommend. These were mushy and lacked any flavor - they weren't the fried or toasted Brussels you get at most restaurants. Cornbread: I would not recommend. It was So So dry and tasted like it had been made a week ago. Patatas Bravas: I would not recommend. These lacked flavor and tasted like they had been premade, left out, and reheated.  Wings: I did not try these (I'm not into wings) but my boyfriend said these were ok but not noteworthy. Prosciutto crostini: I WOULD recommend this. Of what we ordered it was the best (though that's not saying much). It was flavorful but super salty.  Stuffed Pepper: I would not recommend. This was poorly presented (looked like a pile of mush), it also didn't taste good. Apple Fritter desert: I WOULD recommend. This came with 2 fritters and vanilla ice cream. It was delicious and served hot!"}
{"text":"We had some really really great plates and then some that were 'eh... We ordered 9 plates for the 4 of us- and that was plenty. This tapas bar definitely had larger 'small plate' portions than most other tapas restaurants that we've tried out.  Some of the plates were definitely fabulous!  The aioli that came with the calamari was delicious and the prosciutto crostini was a table favorite.  The Lamb lollipops were super yummy, as was the salad that they were served with.  The asparagus with the six minute egg were super and the pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious!  Some of the plates were duds- the queso fundido was passed on by one of the kids, and the potato dish, I can't even remember the name of it, was just yuck. The Brussels sprouts had a very nice flavor, but needed some caramelization or something.    Overall, a nice meal, definitely some pluses and some minuses, but good eats for sure."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in CLT. The ambiance is a bit odd - it kind of feels like you're walking into a leftover vegetarian joint from the 60s, but overlook the looks. The food is fab!   My favorite thing there is the tomato soup and grilled cheese. I know, it sounds simple, but it's hard to do simple right. The grilled cheese is on thick bread, buttery and cheesy and yummy. The soup is perfection, hearty, tangy and rich. On a cold rainy day, there's nothing better.  The salads are great. Big, filling and the dressings all taste homemade. If you are looking for something different, the black bean sliders have just the right amount of spice to make you crave them.   The service can be spotty, but that seems to be a trend in uptown. Go, try Dandelion!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place.  I'm not overtly fond of the Saturday night deal, although if your looking for a packed bar with decent music come on Saturdays!  What I love is the rustic layout, friendly service, variety of food selections, and serving portions.  To me this is more of a tapas type of place, and I've yet to find something I do not like on the menu. I came to dinner with friends for my going away party... and pretty much ordered everything on the menu.  I didn't see till after they actually have an option to order the entire menu for $250!!  Should have done that as we spent a bit over $300, and that is just for five people.  The layout is great.  downstairs with some tables and a small bar, then upstairs with the big bar and a few more private tables.  A HUGE picnic table in the center (should fit like 20!).  If your in the mood for some decent food, an old time look, and are not down with the ultra modern lounges... COME HERE!  Mac n Cheese... damn I wish I had some right now"}
{"text":"I love a great tapas restaurant and this is my favorite in Uptown! The atmosphere/ambiance is great and I enjoyed the service. The first time my husband and I went we got the beer sampler and for tapas we shared the trio of spreads (hummus is delish!), pan seared ahi tuna, and market meatballs. Oh and I'm pretty sure I threw in the market mac and cheese for good measure! I will admit that I went late night with a few friends and got a cured pepperoni flatbread and it wasn't very good at all. I am still going to give this place a 5 due to all of the other amazing dishes/experiences I've had. Too bad I don't live closer to the city so I can enjoy it more often."}
{"text":"Ambiance: fun but a little dark. I was very happy that they placed us next to a window so that the sun could filter in.  Wild Mushroom Pizza was a bit of a disappointment as the mushrooms appeared the standard grocery store variety."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this for food/drinking than this place.  You might get lucky and have Drew as your bartender.  He will take care of you.  There have a wide variety of beers and great food/drink specials.  I really like $3 pints on Monday.  The fried pickles here are to die for.    Secret: Ask Drew about the LUNCHBOX drink.  It is one of my favorite drinks and he is the only one is Charlotte that makes it right.  Trust me.    -Ian M."}
{"text":"Busy Saturday night with the Hornets game just over and a private party upstairs. An hour wait for a table but got 2 seats at the bar in 10 minutes.  5 plates was too much food for my wife and I but the variety was awesome.  Add 2 glasses of wine, 2 delicious craft beers and a Woodford Reserve Bourbon for @$100 and you can't beat it.  Had the Wings, Short Ribs, Pork Belly, Prosciutto Crustini and the Mac and Cheese.  All delicious. Bar staff was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This is review based on what I remember that one night I was there:  The bathroom's clean. The beer's tasty. It's a jumpoff for the jumpoffs. The floor upstairs feels like it might cave in.  (Thumbs up) for Dandelion Market. They've got a good thing going, I think."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today at the bar the bartender great funny and fast best service ever"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in uptown! The food is delicious and all of the drinks are made to perfection. We love coming here and love Zy. She's the best!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails! We swooped in during #snOMG to check it out. They had a great beer selection and I liked my cocktails. Had a warm one with Apple infused whiskey that was excellent on a cold day. The next one was called cobbler, and it was also an amazing winter drink. We didn't try food, but I think we will be back to give that a go!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Have been here several times and now love bringing family and friends when they are in town. It's where my boyfriend and I had our first date and we tend to revisit often. The food is perfect, we've never had a dish that is less than wonderful. The beer and cocktail selection is plentiful. The environment is laid back and cozy, with servers that have been wonderful every time."}
{"text":"The nicest bartender works here. He's Irish and just full of joy. It was so fun going in and having dessert and drinks with my husband. We got the raspberry cheesecake and it was delicious. Kind of a hole in the wall- but a lovely homey place!"}
{"text":"Wouldnt go back. Interior was nice but that was it. The beer was not cold, came in a warm glass... for pointing out how many types of beer they had youd think they would at least serve it cold. Started with fried pickles which was decent, had better. BF got the tuna, he said it lacked flavor, I ordered the chimi steak... one end was huge, the other small causing an overcooked, cooked well, then basically raw steak to be served... it came with fried plantains which were not sweet and very dry and overcooked. I would have sent the steak back except for the fact they were trying to fit a HUGE party next to us... three women were crammed at the end of the table right next to us and we wanted to get the heck out... its a small place so I know its hard for a big group but its not cool to sit somebody basically on top of us... dont like butt in my face when I am eating."}
{"text":"I love the small plate dinner here. The Scallops are well worth it."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, unimpressed by most everything.  Keep in mind I'm a former athlete who is content with most any type of food, so long as it's tolerable.  We ordered a huevos rancheros. When it came out, it best resembled a soup with egg...Pretty gross to be honest. I had a bloody mary with it too, house mix is Zing Zang. Could have easier made it at home and had it tasted 10x better at least. Hot sauce bar is a perk though.  Also ordered brussel sprouts which were COATED in oil. Somehow even worse than the rancheros.  Then the mimosa came, atleast 50% OJ.  Overall experience was only improved because the service was great, but food was honestly terrible. Would not go back for anything other than a beer."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place when looking for a place with casual atmosphere and small plates. We were visiting Charlotte from Raleigh.  The atmosphere was nice, not stuffy. A group of guys at the bar seemed to be trying to talk over each other but that is my only complaint.  Our waitress, Kylie, was pleasant and attentive.   The food was delicious. There were three of us and one vegetarian. We got the cheese plate, the hummus sampler, Shrimp and grits (Grit cake was piping hot), Ahi-tuna, green beans and some other items. Will go again when in Charlotte.   We also went for a drink to an affiliated bar called Connelly's...fun."}
{"text":"Dandelion Market was around the corner from the condo I was staying in for the week. Actually, there were several amazing places within the surrounding block and it was difficult to choose where to go. I took a seat at the bar, but quickly made the decision to move to a table as this wasn't the most friendly dining bar. I'm sure on a normal night, it would be just fine, but there seemed to be a couple large holiday parties going on while I was there as well.   It was truly difficult to choose what I wanted to order; everything looked so tempting. But being a solo diner, I didn't want to over order in any way. Definitely will come back here with a dining buddy or two and explore a lot more of the menu. For this evening's adventure I went with the Southern Caprese and the Mustard Ale Sliders. For my beverage, I chose the Winter Fashioned.   The Winter (Old) Fashioned was delicious and well-balanced. It wasn't too bitter, but just the right amount of sweet to make a nice finish on the palate. My caprese arrived first: fried green tomatoes, fresh mozz & a fig basalmic. It was hard not to pick it up with my hands and shove it in my mouth. I did the polite thing & took small bites. I would have licked the plate too if I wouldn't have garnered stares from my dining neighbors. The sliders came out quickly after they were ordered & I dove right in. They were cooked perfectly and the 'extras' didn't impede on the experience. The cheese & bacon were in perfect proportion and you got a little bit with each little bite.  While dessert was tempting, I was sated, so I called it a night and rolled myself home."}
{"text":"My recent visit to Dandelion was the 4th time that I have been there.  It was also the last time that I will go there.  I've had better experiences here.  But never good enough to offset poor food that I was served at this last visit.    The Good:  Nice selection of beer.  Pretty chill atmosphere.  Decent service.    The Bad.  The Food.  The Food.  The Food.    We started with the calamari.  Meh.  Why I keep taking risks with calamari is beyond me.  It's rarely impressive and is often has blasé as can be. But when it's good (like at Bentley's) I really do enjoy it.  And it's something that should be pretty hard to screw up.  But Dandelion's calamari was mediocre at best.    I thought the Portobello fries sounded interesting.  I was Oh So Wrong!  I love a big meaty Portobello on the grill.  I was hopeful that this dish would have a similarly robust flavor.  It was very disappointing.    Mussels are another thing that I keep trying all over town and it appears that there are only a couple of places (like the Liberty) that consistently get them right.  Dandelion's rendition was subpar.     We finished with a dish that just had to be good - The Crab and Avocado salad.  Crab + avocado + citrus is a combination that one just can't go wrong with, right?  WRONG!!!  I was shocked at how bland this dish was.  Nothing about it was good - not the presentation, or the texture, and certainly Not the flavor.    Then today as I was paying my credit card bill, Dandelion Market gave me on last swift kick to the groin.  It was bad enough that I wasted $72 on a very poor meal.  But Why did the server add on an additional $0.67 to her tip?  Okay, maybe it was a mistake and I really don't care about $0.67.  It's the principal of it."}
{"text":"Great beer and higher than average food. Menu has only a small list of food options but every one I have gotten has been top notch.  Go for lunch instead of dinner tho, as the lunch menu consists of some good salads and sandwiches, but the dinner menu has some really unique items (try 'everything but the bun' if you can!) Heres to hoping it doesn't fall under the 5th street curse as many have before it!"}
{"text":"The food here is quite good that we could choose what to get, so we got a little of everything.  This was both good and bad.  Since we had a decent sized group you got one bite and then it was gone.  Really liked tapa plates, but my recommendation for groups is to limit your selection so you can enjoy your meal.  The prices could be a little bit better as well as the bill was quite high and none of us felt like we were satisfied and we were not looking to be \"stuffed\"."}
{"text":"It was my 3rd time here, last night we stopped in again for dinner. This is not a place for hungry people but great if you want appetizers. The Scallops were delicious but you only get 4 and the Butter Mushrooms had a great  Marsala sauce, I recommend both. The sevice was attentive and the beer selection favorable as was the wine list. It is dark and romantic upstairs, downstairs is more of a meeting place. I just wished it was wheel-chair friendly so our group could of gone there last friday."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  It isn't quite \"amazing\" but it is better than \"okay,\" so it gets 4 stars!  I've been here for dinner and lunch.  I like the dinner menu better.    Dinner: I think I was a little overly excited to have found a place that had tapas here in Charlotte so I came in with positive expectations....and they really didn't disappoint!  They have a pretty good variety although I wouldn't really describe them as \"unique.\"  We tried the trio of spreads, stuffed zucchini, chicken roulade, and the grilled steak skewers.  Everything was very tasty!!  There were several other items I would like to try including the santa fe corn, baked potato croquettes and fried pickles!!    Lunch: It was mostly salads, sandwiches and soups....which is fine if that is what you are looking for!  Their turkey sandwich was big and plenty.  They certainly didn't skimp on the meat!  You get to choose a side---fries, salad, fruit etc.  It was overall a perfect lunch portion and satisfying.  Again, it wasn't amazing but it was very good.  I'm not in love with the atmosphere...I wish they had a few cushioned couches or booths but it is all wooden tables and some of them are right out in the open on the elevated seating area...so I felt too exposed.  I would have to agree with previous reviews that this would probably be the PERFECT late night spot.  It is more of a bar than a restaurant and it is somewhat of a dive sprinkled with a little bit of trendy.    I like this place and it serves a great purpose in Charlotte.  It would be fun to start here before dinner or end up here after you are looking for a midnight snack.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"When I lived uptown, this place was always first on my list. For drinks, for pre-nights out meals, for a quick lunch... and if I had written this when I still lived uptown, it would be a five star review and then some.  A few weeks ago I found myself uptown on a weeknight and was need of a post-show meal. Obviously, the first place that popped into my head was Dandelion Market. They had changed the menu a bit since the last time I was there but some of the staples were right where I'd left them. We ordered the cheese plate, the mussels, and the pommes frites. You can't go wrong with mussels, bacon, and cream - so this dish is highly recommended. The fries were delicious, were a huge portion, and the homemade ketchup was great too. I really liked the cheeses offered, but that's where that fifth star started to fade. 1) If your menu doesn't specify the cheeses coming to the table, either the food runner or the server should tell you what's on it... or just be available to answer questions when you can't figure it out yourself. 2) the only bread offered should not be partially grilled pita, it doesn't hold up to anything (with a different selection of cheeses I might have understood, but not with what we received)... I ended up stealing the toasted bread from the mussels to eat some of the cheese.   It also took a really long time to get our round of drinks, and the place was not busy. plus, when we finally did get our drinks I was informed it was the last of the brand of liquor I had requested... bummer.  But the last missteps aside, I still love dandelion market. Their menu has a great variety of dishes and who doesn't love sampling a ton of delicious small plates? I don't think I've ever had a \"bad\" dish from DM, and I don't see them disappointing me in the future. (especially with their excellent beer selection)."}
{"text":"Had heard about this place from a few friends so when I found myself in Charlotte for the first time (for work) it was high on my list of places to go.  It did not disappoint. Happened to accidentally show up on \"Wine Night\" which was a great perk. All their bottles of wine were $15 instead of $25. A great deal! The fact that they even do that is really great. And on a Tuesday night it was totally packed! (Not sure if that's a normal weeknight or if everyone was there for their cheap bottles of wine.) Atmosphere was great!! And the service was really good too.   My & a friend shared four tapas (small plates) and they were all really good and turned out to be a pretty decent portion. Didn't leave stuffed but definitely didn't leave hungry either. Perfect.  - Sweet Potato Gnocchi - wasn't my choice (I'm not a huge gnocchi fan) but had a good flavor and came in a little skillet that was a decent tapas portion. - Sausage Stuffed Pepper - was delicious! Not my choice either, but was *one of* my favorite things! Had a little spice and was a filling small plate. - Southern Caprese - fried green tomatoes with homemade pesto mozzarella. It was really as delicious as it sounds! Definitely try this! - Shrimp & Grits - was grit cakes with goat cheese on top and really well done shrimp. Delicious! Maybe my favorite thing of the night!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying a tapas restaurant. It wasn't bad nor was it great. I ordered the fried pickles, meatballs, and green beans. The fried pickles were a little tooooo greasy. The meatballs were soooo dry. But the green beans were yummy. I didn't know why the meatballs were so dry. I really had to use a knife to cut them. The sauce on it was really sour. It was ok overall. Glad I tried it out while I was traveling for work."}
{"text":"After a few recents visits, for cocktails after work with colleagues, I can say Dandelion Market delivers.  The beer selection and drinks offered do not disappoint. And, the food, everything has been great.  I have only sampled appetizers, but they were all great and something we all enjoyed.  The crab dip with pita chips are my favorite.  A definite hidden gem that I would be happy to get back to again. Why not five stars you ask, servers can be a little rude at times and can be MIA at times. Overall, as I said, I do look forward to getting back."}
{"text":"Dandelion was excellent - it reminded me of a cozy little restaurant from back home in San Francisco with a southern touch. The ambiance is dark and cozy. There's a small bar with beers on tap and many wines to choose from, as well as an open-spaced dining room.  The menu is designed tapas-style so they encourage to order 2-3 dishes per person. We split 4 dishes between the two of us and a beer flight and it came to just around $60.  The shrimp and grits and the lamb lollipops were my absolute favorite,very memorable and super delicious!  Great for a date night, drinks with friends, or a small group outing!"}
{"text":"They are just so-so. Drinks are entirely too weak and food is average, not too exciting. A decent place if you're hungry, but will not be rushing back. Burger sliders came out and looked completely different. One was a well done, frozen patty. The other was a raw ground beef patty."}
{"text":"The Dandelion Market is one of my favorites in Charlotte. It has a fantastic ambience--it works for groups and dates (I've been there for both). Upstairs is cozy with booths, a bar, and the longest, most beautiful farm table I've ever seen.   I'm not always a huge fan of small plates because it feels like you can never get enough and they're so expensive, but they are SO worth it here. Shout outs to the pan seared ahi tuna, shrimp and grits (unbelievable grit cakes), and lamb kabobs. Potato croquettes were nothing to write home about.   Service was great each time, and I appreciated how quickly they accommodated us as soon as they opened. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone living in or visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, but slow service. The bloody mary bar was the best value for brunch drinks. Beware brunch specialities do not come with a side and, in my hungry opinion, could use one! The caprese benedict was good, but I did not taste the pesto in the hollandaise. My husband really enjoyed the Monte Cristo. The side of fries was a generous portion, much better value than the hashbrowns which were really breakfast potatoes. The ketchup was very flavorful. Nice indoor seating, no patio option that I saw!"}
{"text":"Delish and so fun to share plates. Don't be fooled by \"small\" plates. There was plenty to enjoy for a party of 5! Beer is great too."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place after work. Excellent tapas and beer selection. The food is genuinely good and the atmosphere is quaint."}
{"text":"Very small portions but the steak skewers are the best thing I've ate in a long time. Great local beers and price is not bad. Portion size only thing keeping it from 5 star."}
{"text":"admittedly it takes something (un)extraordinary for me to bother to write a review...maybe i was just here on a bad night, but unfortunately doubt i would try again  came here with a colleague on a Wednesday night and was seated upstairs.  3 different waitresses took various parts of our order which was more so symbolic of confusing service than over welcoming hospitality.  after i was served my 2 plates, my colleagues gristly tuna was served which she chose not to finish.  we also gave up on our brussel sprouts which did not come after 25 minutes so we decided to wrap things up and move on.  the tuna and brussel sprouts were at least removed from the bill  also the co2 was definitely not correct when our tap beers were poured despite our waitresses' instance that the bartender checked it after our initial comment"}
{"text":"Living 3 blocks away, my fiancé and I go to Dandelion more often than I care to admit. New restaurants opening up every week in Charlotte and we always end up here!Service is always quick, drinks are on point (my favorite is the Cobbler in fall/winter) and the food is an experience itself. We always get a flatbread and baked potato croquettes and then mix it up with a few others. Scallops, Korean BBQ ribs, Black bean sliders and steak skewers are all great options. I'm surprised there's bad reviews here at all-we've been over a dozen times and never left feeling anything but satisfied."}
{"text":"Got tapas before a show at Blumenthal Performing Arts Center. Great stop to grab something to eat and great to go to with a group of people. The food was delicious (we had the crab cake, shrimp and grits, and mac and cheese). Comfort food to the extreme, but it wasn't overwhelming. I'll be coming back to try more!  The strawberry-gin drink was also refreshing. Not too sweet, just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I went on a bad day, but I was not impressed.  The service was lacking, the food took too long, the portions were small, and it wasn't all hot upon arrival to the table.  Yes, I get that tapas entrees are meant to be small, but we went for brunch and we were expecting normal portions.  The entire party would've willingly ordered more drinks, but alas, our glasses sat empty as our server was nowhere to be found.  The apple butter that was served with the biscuits was good.  The blackberry mimosa that I had was good, just never replenished.  Another member of my group had the french toast sticks, and they were sweet, but decent.  It wasn't all horrible, and I think most of our experience can be attributed to the poor service.  I imagine our food was cold because it sat in the kitchen window waiting for her to run it to the table, but in her questionable absence, it sat until lukewarm.  I'd say it might be worth giving them another try, but I'm in no hurry to do so."}
{"text":"We went for lunch, and unfortunately their lunch menu is a bunch of fairly dull sandwiches instead of the tapas. The items weren't necessarily bad, just fairly unremarkable (at least the bread was fresh on them). The cheesecake dessert was solid. But the service was so, so, slow. It took a long time just to place our order, and then a much longer time to get our food. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the years. Loved the place the first few times. Then, on my second to last visit, I was completely let down. All the more creative items had gone from their menu that I had continued to come back for. I tried some other less evoking things and was dissappointed. The prices were way too high for the ho hum I was served. On my last visit, the give them one more shot time? The food was a complete let down, the service was lackluster at best, our table was dirty, and (upstairs) it was so loud that it was nearly impossible to hear ourselves think (let alone converse). I have since adopted a new favorite place in Charlotte with amazing food, outstanding decor, impeccable service, and a wine list to envy. I will not be back to Dandelion. I had such high hopes. Alas, it was not meant to be."}
{"text":"I'll do a quick lunch during the week by myself. Catch me devouring their grilled cheese and tomato soup and chase it w an espresso.   I'll meet up w a few girl friends for wine and tapas on a Wednesday or Thursday night. We drink red and kvetch about men. Shocker.   Once in a blue moon I'll venture Uptown on a Saturday night for someone's bday or other celebration and can usually convince the group to go here for dancing and drinking on the second floor. Affordable, heavy pour, top shelf Vodka drinks and booty shaking music for_the_win. I will say the crowd can veer toward early to mid 20s raucous and may exhibit slappable behavior but that just goes w the territory.   Brunch selection and chillax vibe on Sunday has been enjoyed by little dude, myself, and my bro many times. We always enjoy it.   If I lived and/or hung out Uptown way more than I do I'd be the Duchess of Dandelion Market. For real. I really like this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this restaurant! They take effortless simplicity to a whole new level, especially in the uptown area where everything is overwhelming and has the \"trying too hard\" vibe. The interior on the first floor is spacious, all dark wood, dim lighting, and a decent-sized, rounded bar area. It's allows you to feel intimate without being overcrowded. I invited a group of friends out for my birthday and chose Dandelion Market because it is large enough to accommodate a group of 10 but without that chain restaurant feel. I'm definitely a NoDa fan because I love the small eclectic feel of the restaurants there, but the places there are always so small and never take reservations. This restaurant seemed to have the atmosphere with the accommodations that I was looking for. They greeted us and had our table set up within 5-10 minutes.   Their menu is a \"tapas style,\" or small plates but with a modern twist and a southern flair. Everything from a cheese plate to shrimp and grits. I get worried about tapas, especially in large groups, because as soon as I share I rarely have enough for myself. However, their plates were generously portioned that sharing was never an issue. I also love variety so this menu was perfect. I got the cheese plate, which came with honeycomb that I thought was pretty unique. I also got the macaroni and cheese, which was amazing and the calamari, which had more than enough to share. The shrimp and grits were definitely the favorite of the table. The grits come in a cake style with jumbo sauteed shrimp. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the macaroni and cheese was baked with the crunchy decadence I look for in that kind of dish. BONUS: the dishes are reasonable priced, even if you want a lot or a little.  Their specialty drinks were a little on the sweet side for me, so I stuck with a classic cosmopolitan (hey, it was my birthday!). We also ordered shots, so I felt the classy with party style was well balanced. Their wine is also well priced.   The service was okay, there were a few times I needed a drink refill and had a hard time finding the server, but we didn't have any issues with the service and I felt comfortable being able to socialize with my group of friends without feeling like we needed to fit the intimate atmosphere.   We went upstairs to the bar after dinner and while it was a nice bar with the same theme, it was brighter and less comfortable for just drinking at a bar. The only problem is that when we told the server we were just looking to get some drinks she suggested we try another bar nearby, making us feel a little unwelcome, so we left.   Overall, Dandelion Market was a great experience that even friends who have lived in the Charlotte area for years were surprised about. It's definitely an unknown gem in the uptown area, which is mostly full of loud clubs or uninspiring pubs."}
{"text":"I love this place! If I could give it more stars, I would! Awesome food and drinks. The ambiance is excellent and cool wall art!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, but ugg on the unimpressive food. Tried 3 things from the menu & gave all to the person I was with.   The portions are ridiculously small - steak skewers = 2 small skewers (maybe 10 bites) for $13 - not cool.  Best tip about this place: works for drinks (they have a bloody mary bar on the weekends) but no way would I go here again for food."}
{"text":"This is a great, hidden gem. I ordered the PEI muscles and pan seared scallops, both of which were very good. They have a great list of local beers on tap as well as many other options. I think the upstairs bar area is super cool. There were a lot of great people in the crowd on this Thursday night."}
{"text":"The lady bartender is seriously rude! Plus this place is empty and its 1:05am. It was my first and last time. She just threw the drink? I mean seriously. Never again plus a fight broke out. This place is a mess."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on the night of the Jay-Z concert. Great tapas and great cocktails. Will be sure to bring my out of town guest here to get a taste of what Charlotte has to offer."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch, I don't think it's really a breakfast/brunch spot, felt more like an Irish pub and probably best for drinks at night. I had Low Country Hash, which was alright, but not worth $12... It seemed more like a side than a main dish. Staff was ok, but when I asked for a hot sauce, I was told where it was, instead of bringing it to me, I don't mind getting it on my own, but still... Interior was quite cool: exposed brick walls and interesting decorations, will need to go there again just for beers or something, cause I wasn't very impressed with brunch"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place on yelp, and headed here for dinner. The dishes are all served tapas style (which I love) but they really weren't that delicious (which I do not love).  I was really excited to try the southern caprese (fried green tomatoes and house made mozarella) but the cheese was too firm, too cold and really underwhelming. The tomatoes were great, sauced with a sweet balsamic. That same balsamic, however, fully OVER-sauced the prosciutto crostinis beyond palatability. We had a sausage plate, fine but regular, a nice bean dish with a tomatoey herby sauce, and mussels, that seemed to be cooked in the very same sauce. Good sauce, just redundant.  A cucumber cocktail was too sweet to drink and the wine was fine, but regular.  I didn't hate it by any means, but it wasn't properly satisfying and I surely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We really really like Dandelion for many reasons.  The food is excellent, service is top notch with a well orchestrated, coordinated team.  We are often bummed when we can't get seated due to too many tourists in town.  Our only complaint is the music is always too loud for dining comfort."}
{"text":"This experience is based on a weekday lunch.  I ordered the Black Bean sliders with a side of fruit.  The Sliders came on too large quarters of pita bread, and felt a bit mismatched.  The patties were delicious.  The side of fruit looked like it was just scooped from a grocery's pre-cut fruit section.  The bottom of the bowl was filled with juice.    My Fiancé had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  It was a tasty, classic grilled cheese sandwich.  And while it was tasty, I don't think the soup was made in kitchen.    As far as the food goes, based on the decor, name, and location I did expect something slightly more Artisan and handmade.  I guess I'll have to come back for dinner and try again.  The menu does look delicious, however I think Dandelion Market could put a little more into the quality of lunch.  Service was friendly, however, the wait for food was longer than expected for what we ordered."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review in quit sometime.  Truthfully nothing has blown my socks off to spend the time to write one...that was until I went to Dandelion Market.  Let me first start off with- Im an extremely picky eater, and not willing to try new things most of the time.  In addition to my pickiness, I'm not much for tapas, no reason, just part of my weirdness.  I was extremely and pleasantly surprised by this place.   We had a work dinner (about 15 people), and we went to Dandelion Market.  Upstairs had plenty of room to host a large group gathering down to an intimate couples dinner.  While downstairs has a great bar and plenty of room for a happy hour.  I don't think there was much on the menu that we DIDN'T order.  Personal Favorites were: BAKED POTATO CROQUETTES, FRIED PICKLES, SLIDERS, GRILLED STEAK SKEWERS (personally ordered 3 of these), BBQ SHORT RIB, SWEET & SPICY GREEN BEANS.  I'm not a big brussel sprouts fan, but the table ordered 4 servings of them...they apparently are amazing.    Serving sizes are perfect, for 2-4 people, if you have anymore, make sure you order multiple orders.  If you have a large group, you can order the entire market menu for $275.  I enjoyed the food here so much, we went back 2 weeks later."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites in the city. You can't fail with anything on the menu, and with most items, the portions are plentiful.   Their calamari is way way better than it should be-- very fresh and not chewy. Love the lamb lollipops. The fries are high class and irresistible. Mac and cheese is a winner along with the ribs and chicken wings.   This place is noisy downstairs in the evenings, but that works fine with the great energy here.   Half price wine bottles on Tuesday. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"I feel bad going with 2 stars. I feel like an angry patron or competing restaurant who is just vengeful. But I'm not, really I'm not. I'm a weary traveler.   You see, I very much enjoyed my experience, but I was underwhelmed by everything but the beer (can't go wrong with a Two Hearted). The brussel sprouts were undercooked and under seasoned (coming from someone who uses very little salt). My entree was the \"surf & turf\" of pulled pork and scallops; namely: two crustaceans and a little pile of pulled pork beneath.   I admit it: I was intrigued by the menu description; but was let down like prom night. Scallops (like the brussel sprouts) were undercooked (and I eat sushi so don't even think I'm not not fond of raw fish).  The pork was the highlight I guess, but it was literally 4 fork-fulls.   The service was fine and the prices were ok. Overall, not deserving of high praise.   Oh and $3 draft Mondays would be the only reason I return."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on a Wednesday night.  It was really crowded due to an active afterwork bar scene.  The tapas were okay.  I really liked the calamari, and my wife loved the fried mushrooms.  The chimichurri was okay, but it had cilantro, which I hate.  But it's okay if you dont' mind.  Service was slow.  The host tried to provide service but failed, and we didn't get a waitress until we were almost done. I will cut them a break because they had three large parties that evening, but it strikes me given their location, the staff should have been prepared.  However, my main pet peeve is they served the first few tapas one plate at a time, which defeats the purpose of tapas which is to share them."}
{"text":"This place and especially our last visit there was nearly perfect.  I called in advance to ask about parking (normally we've cabbed it uptown or taken the light rail, but this time we were driving and didn't know if the restaurant validated at a nearby lot, didn't matter, we found street parking right across from the Market) and spoke with a young woman who was pleasant.  We decided this time that instead of ordering nine different small plates, we would start with one then order two more and see how we were feeling.  Good call, we were stuffed. All in all the wife and I have been here a bunch and have tried just about everything on the menu and it has all been at the least 8/10 stars for taste and quality, so you really cannot go wrong, just order what sounds good for you at that time.  Beer/Wine selection is awesome for me (not so much for the prego wife) always a good list of great beer.  The only thing that holds our most recent visit back from a full 5 stars was the crappy attitude the hostess had. Horrible.  When I tell you we want a table, and you indicate we can sit at the bar, and we reply that we don't want to sit at the bar and would prefer to wait, don't give me the stink eye, do your job, walk around the MASSIVE dining room and see where people are at in their dinner service.  Then MAYBE extend some courtesy and say something, I don't know, along the lines of \"Well feel free to wait at the bar or right over here and I'll come and get you when a table is ready..\"  Or just stare at us uncomfortably for a few moments.  Thank the lord above our server more than made up for the inexperience up front, she was quick, funny, and her timing was excellent.  Of course we'll be back, just hoping we don't have to deal with negative Nancy up front again."}
{"text":"Went with 8 people to dinner and I think between us we got pretty much every tapa on the menu. I didn't hear any complaints and saw a lot of clean plates.   I got the sweet potato gnocchi and the shrimp and grits. The gnocchi was amazing and the grits were very impressive as well. They were presented in a unique manner and went great with the goat cheese and sauce.  I ordered the Mucho Gusto cocktail and it was the best drink I've had in some time. It had tequila, charred pineapple and cayenne pepper."}
{"text":"Not going to say anything here that likely anyone else hasn't said.  We made a reservation for a table of 8 prior to the show at the Belk Theater.    Four of us shared some apps while the rest of the table fended for themselves (eh - the in-laws).  Food came out perfectly and with enough time to be finishing up one dish.  Yes - the food is tapas style (small plates that just come out whenever they're ready).  So, unless the entire table is ordering together, one half of the table may be finishing up before someone receives anything.  That happened - but just a risk you are willing to take.  The food was good...except the patatas bravas.  I love patatas bravas - I lived in Spain for awhile and they were one of my favorite dishes.  However, at Dandelion, they almost seem like a bad American take on patatas bravas.  Would I have them again - probably, because I love patatas bravas - but I'd likely still be disappointing.    Almost everyone enjoyed their meals (at least at my end of the table everyone did) - see in-laws :-\    Great little date place though!"}
{"text":"We had just arrived in Charlotte and it was late at night. We were looking for a place with 1) TVs to watch the unfortunate game on Sunday night and 2) good food.  Dandelion Market was perfect for what we needed. The waitress misled us a little bit and told us to order 2-3 items per person. We definitely ended up with too much food. Here are some of the items we sampled:  -Mediterranean Trio -Prosciutto Crostini -Pan Seared Scallops -Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops -Grilled Chicken Wings -Market Mac & Cheese -Pomme Frites -Dando Brussel Sprouts -Grilled Steak Sliders -PEI Mussels -Beet Salad  Overall, everything was good. The Prosciutto Crostini was the weakest link. We really loved the fries. We were beyond stuffed (5 of us total) and had some leftovers. If you go, I would recommend that you order at most 2 items per person to start."}
{"text":"We stopped in Dandelion Market the morning after an open bar wedding hoping to relieve the pounding hangover. Dandelion has a fun gastropub vibe, with random kitsch (think a wall of clogs organized in a pyramid), a couple of tvs tuned to sports and a middle bloody mary bar (at least during brunch).  There were a dozen or so beers on tap and the drink menu was diverse. We attempted to hair-of-the-dog it with mimosas, which were ok but not the best I've had. It was a futile effort anyways. The strong, fresh coffee was better.  There were a handful of delicious sounding breakfast options (think creative hash and omellette dishes) and several more lunch options. I debated on trying the mustard burger sliders, but settled on the grilled cheese and tomato soup instead. While we waited the bar tender dropped off warm biscuits with two different jellies.  After a too long 30+ minute wait, out comes the star. Giant, thick, grilled and buttered bread oozing cheese. The tomato soup was also thick, just how I like it. Who has time to worry about headaches while eating such artery clogging perfection? It hit the spot.  Unfortunately the bartender, who was good at first, faded out and became very slow. Watching her text on her phone while we waited for the check was frustrating. Overall though this was a solid brunch choice and I'd gladly go back and try dinner."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I decided to try the place because of what people told us we weren't disappointed at all we tried the shrimp n grits, sliders, proscutto crostini, apple puff pastry, sea scallops with the poblano creamed corn. The scallops were my favorite so tender and the creamed corn was on point! The have alcoholic ginger beer which my boyfriend loved!! Monday is $3 pint night select drafts!! We will def be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something a little different during an afternoon stroll uptown and decided to give this place a try. Allow me to be the first to say, I love the simple decor of this place....maybe I'm in love with exposed brick... who knows (lol) but I loved nonetheless.   The coffee was smooth and I decided to try a ham steak and a small plate of French toast sticks. All was great, the French toast were a little too sweet for my taste but definitely original. ALSO, if you're picky when it comes to your Bloody Mary... no worries, you can just make your own... they have a Bloody Mary bar in the middle (not sure if this was just something they were doing for Brunch or if it's everyday, be sure to ask).   Cool Uptown Brunch spot for the books, so I will be back."}
{"text":"I like this place! Meet a friend for Sunday brunch. Food was tasty and when it was time for mimosas (prior to the time being moved up) it was a celebration. I recommend others to go to brunch but I want to go back for dinner or in a regular day. Service was good and for some reason I really like the bacon..."}
{"text":"The brunch and dinner menus are elaborate and impressive! For brunch I recommend the \"Little Italy\" omelet and as for dinner...the lamb lollipops! However, don't leave without asking the waiter/waitress about their wooden shoe display!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, there were some interesting flavors, but it was all marred by terrible wait staff.  Our server forgot a soda, then forgot our bottle of wine, with no apology for making us remind her how to do her job.  She was very unfriendly and I can't imagine I'd go back.  Atmosphere wasn't so great either, it's basically a very dark bar.  Much better experience over at The Asbury."}
{"text":"Okay, as a gluten-free person with vegetarian preferences, I could not have anticipated the DELIGHT of the brussel sprouts.  Wow. Also, the sweet potato gnocchi blew our minds. Fun atmosphere, great service and bottles of wine for $25. Why not come here every weekend?'vn"}
