{"text":"I thought they had a great variety of hot dogs. All the food was very good and came out super fast, I had the Godfather and Chili Dog, both were very good! The happy hour was great too! 5 dogs 3 mixed whiskey drinks and a chili cheese fries for under $30! I will be back, and I will tell others to check it out!"}
{"text":"First time ordering, called in for pick up.  My friend came home and I noticed my Muny Lot Special was missing, waited 20 minutes for 1 hot dog while the rest of my food sat in the bag getting soggy and cold..Not impressed and will never go back, i would rather go to Steves or Hot Dog Inn and get the best hot dogs!"}
{"text":"An energetic but casual atmosphere: funky decor with upbeat music, friendly and quick service, markers provided in the wooden condiments basket so you can sign the basket, a chalkboard wall back by the rest rooms where you can get creative while you wait for your dog--all a great support to an inventive menu. This place won't deliver your dog on a boring bun (unless that's how you want it); our Cincinnati Skyline and Cosby Doggs amped up further with their house-made ketchup and a serving of perfect hand-cut-skin-on-sea-salt-and-pepper fries."}
{"text":"If you are like me and you love hot dogs, whiskey, great service and a fun atmosphere, then the Whiskey Dog is for you! Stopped in on a recent visit to Cleveland and will be back on next trip."}
{"text":"Man oh man was I glad that I came to this place hungry. I got the fries, Seoul Dog and the Muni Lot Special. I got the Muni on a vegetarian dog and the seoul on beef.  The bartender warned me that the vegetarian was spicy, but that was right up my alley, so I didn't mind..but if you're not keen on spice, I would recommend asking what their veggie dog base is for the day just to make sure it isn't the chipotle.  ANYWAY, I was so satisfied with both hot dogs..the beef being my favorite and I've dreamt ( I'm not kidding ) about the seoul dog more than once since with a constant craving for it.  I'd wished my maternity tights weren't so tight so that I could have tried another menu item as well. That being said, it's mommy approved.  We also had the fries with various sauces, all of which were delicious.  I'll return back once I pop this baby out to pair a wiener with some whiskey."}
{"text":"The setting - especially for North Olmsted - is awesome. As others have noted, Whiskey Dogg's interior feels like it belongs in Ohio City or Tremont (I think that's a compliment).  I've only had one dog there so far, but it was fantastic. I think the one I had is not a regular menu item, but it should be! It was described as the \"Super Bowl special\" and had crispy pork skin, salsa verde, green onions, and probably other things I'm forgetting. The pickle was delicious, and the beer selection is robust.  The dogs are $4, and the beer is about the same. Pretty good value for a really well-made dog.  I'm thrilled to have a great new place so close to home.  EDIT 4/15/14: FYI - My credit card statement showed this transaction happened at the 2nd Floor Lounge, which (I think) was the name of the previous establishment at this location."}
{"text":"Got the slaw dog. All beef hot dog with slaw, onion, jalape√±o, and cheese sauce. Felt the bun was too big and took away from actually tasting the hot dog. Me and one other customer in the whole place. Wasn't really feeling it."}
{"text":"Hot dogs and whiskey, oh my!   The hot dogs come pre-dressed, which is what makes this place different.  The menu is entirely hot dogs, french fries, and booze--simple and all enjoyable selections.   I had the Holy Aioli and it was pretty delicious! Nothing out of this world, but again, it's a hot dog. Those don't get too gourmet, but I love them anyways! That said, oh my gosh, those BUNS! I don't know what it was about that bun, but I could just eat that alone. The fries were good, but nothing too special. A friend and I got them with the sauces (we love sauce!) and they were really tasty. I definitely recommend giving those dips a try.   I'm pretty sure I'll be back here. The atmosphere was relaxed and it's a nice small place. A couple of notes:   That photo DOES NOT make me want the Cosby dog...ever. Some food is just not worthy of a snapshot.  The women's bathroom door does not lock easily. It's a one-seater in there, so if you don't pay special attention to the lock, you're getting stumbled upon (yes, this happened when I was here...twice.)  I'm not much of a whiskey drinker, but my friend is and she says that the whiskey drinks were delicious!  The double \"g\" in dog will always irritate me, so I'm choosing to ignore it. Pet peeves!  The prices are great! I got a hot dog, split some fries, and had a fancy beer for $15 before tip. That's pretty rare these days!"}
{"text":"Decided it was time to try this gourmet hot dog place with my dog-loving-aficionado daughter last night.  He had a good time and enjoyed some of our dog choices...here is the rundown:  * Happy hour is solid, $1 off dogs and draft beers along with half-priced whiskey drinks  * Salt and pepper fries were rock solid...no real need for any kind of sauce (although they offer many to choose from)  * Whiskey Dogg selections:    ~ Seoul Dogg...excellent!  The combination of garlic cream cheese, Kimchee, crispy fried onions, sesame seeds, cilantro and wasabi mayo was creamy (with a kick) and a perfect topping.     ~ Cincinnati Sykline...meh. I was not a fan of either their beer-cheddar sauce (was grainy) or the chili (which had too much of a cinnamon flavor to it).     ~ Philly Cheese Dogg...also meh. The added sliced beef was tasty, but the same beer-cheddar sauce just put us off.     ~ Chien Du Roi...was the rock star of the bunch! Who would have thought that a dog topped with peanut butter, bananas and bacon crumbles would be so good? Would order this one again in a heartbeat.  So there you have it...two solid dogs and two e could have done without...but it was fun sampling / trying so many varieties and we'll do the same our next time around."}
{"text":"Yumm! These dogs are delicious and a good bargain ($4 dog). Comparable to Happy Dog but lacks the customization. Not necessarily a bad thing as these dogs are put together impressively and you know it will be delicious and unique. I mean who really needs to put Froot Loops on their hot dog anyway?  Great place if you enjoy a cocktail, craft beer, or straight bourbon. The bartender's were also very friendly and helpful. Great happy hour spot!"}
{"text":"Debated between three and four stars, so it is more like 3.5. Small space but an interesting decor. This place feels like it should be in Tremont or OC. Dark lighting? Check. Morose music? Check. Tatted barkeeps? Ironic facial hair? PBR on full display in the cooler? Check, check and check. Problem is, most of the patrons looked like Great Northern mall rats. I'm sure they won't care if the till is full. Food - Slaw Dog and Seoul Dog get a thumbs up. Cosby Dog was too much and not great, thumbs tilting down. Beer list is only ok. 4-5 drafts and most of them sucked. I stuck with a couple Hippie IPAs and the wife had Bumbleberry from a bottle."}
{"text":"Who knew hot dogs could be a gourmet meal? That's cuz their not just ordinary hot dogs. They're doggs. And they're delicious. Handmade toppings that create meals out of what was once believed to be only street cart food, these doggs exceed expectations at every level without ever exceeding the price. Delicious sides and awesome beer and whiskey drinks. This is our official Monday night spot and I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Okay, went to the Whiskey Dogg and it wasn't the Whiskey Dogg anymore.  The new owner (who was an owner from the Whisky Dogg era) stated that he bought it 3-weeks ago and final changed the sign a day ago.  Bartender didn't know much about craft beers, which was on their sign...but might not be anymore since they changed the name.  Menu is the same from the Whisky Dogg name had a coupon for a $1 off a Dog, which they said was not valid anymore.  Decided to drink a couple and exit."}
{"text":"I don't eat hotdogs very much, but when I do I will do so at Whiskey Dogg.   What can I say. Whiskey Dogg made me like hot dogs again. So far I've had the windy city dogg, the godfather dogg, Seoul dogg, and the dippy dogg (corndog).   Windy city dogg: Chicago style with the bright green relish, peppers, pickle, etc. Instead of the poppy seed bun you get a pretzel bun. Love the pretzel bun as it doesn't get soggy. Good choice.   Godfather dogg: peppers, onions, marinara sauce, and prosciutto if I'm remembering correctly. Great taste. Sauce was a little on the sweet side for my tastes, but it all worked well together. I would add some red pepper flakes to finish it.   Seoul dogg: perhaps my favorite. Delicious Kimchi atop the hotdog with a whole bunch of other goodness.   Dippy dogg: simple, basic, yummy. Hot dog covered in batter and deep fried to perfection. I feel the dippy dogg almost takes second stage to the 4 dippy sauces you get. BBQ, curry mayo, habanaro aioli, and a wasabi sauce. I feel in love with the curry mayo. They are all good though.   I also tried the chili cheese fries. Nice and sloppy. Just the way they should be.   They have a fantastic selection of whiskey, bourbon, and Scotch. Excellent craft beer selection to chase your shots down with."}
{"text":"Decent idea...gourmet hot dogs. Simple menu. Decent selection s of beer, whiskey, bourbon...  This is the old Pepper Joe's that closed a couple years ago.   Dogs were quite tasty.  Loved the combos on the menu.  It was a difficult choice!  It is directly across from my beloved Fat Head's. (My fiance will not step foot in there because they started in Pittsburgh. Don't worry, I make up the difference.).  So, although I thought the place was interesting... I'll return here if he's with me.  Two shout outs: they make their ketchup. It was outstanding!!  Good texture, a little kick, but not too hot. WOW!!!  Also, we had an awesome waitress. She was very friendly and attentive. She rocked out loud."}
{"text":"We loved our hot dogs, and agreed the Seoul dogg was the best of the bunch, but they were all delicious. They make their own ketchup, which was a tad sweet, but after a few fries, we really came around and liked it. The mustard in the squeeze bottle is stadium mustard, which was a pleasant surprise.  Wonderful bartenders and staff, great atmosphere, a great beer selection, and kickass food. I look forward to going back very soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in just after they opened today since we missed lunch and were in need of food. Young, fun bar vibe, with plenty of space. We tried 3 different dogs, the Seoul, Philly and Cincinnati style. All were terrific. Nice balance of topping to dog and good quality ingredients. They are not afraid of bold flavors here. The salt and pepper fries were quite peppery (in a good way) and their homemade ketchup was the perfect foil, sweet and tangy and delicious. We tried a couple of beers and found the bourbon barrel ale to be outstanding! Smooth with a hint of vanilla. They only have 5 beers on tap but their selection in bottles is wide ranging, with something for everyone. Of course they have a nice selection of whiskeys and drinks made with whiskey. The Tombstone sounded tasty but it was only 4:00p.m. and we had to drive home! Next time. And there will be a next time, when I crave dinner and don't need a sandwich as big as my head. Nice job, Whiskey Dogg! Good food, good drinks, good prices, nice people. We'll keep coming in early and recommend you to our younger friends and family members for later hours."}
{"text":"Whiskey Dogg is everything it claims to be. Good selection of whiskey, bourbon, and scotch. Interesting group of craft beers on tap and bottles without being overwhelming. Most of all, great dogg's!   I've only had the \"Slaw Dogg\" and the \"Seoul Dogg\" and they were both very good. Kimchee on a hotdogg, genius!  I plan to return soon to sample their other offerings. The salt and pepper fries are a great compliment to either of these doggs, and prices are very reasonable (even outside happy hour). I haven't been in when it is particularly busy, but service was fast and friendly on my 2 visits.  A cool place to grab a bite after work, or stop into during a night out."}
{"text":"The Whiskey D-O-double G delivers on great hot dogs and extremely cheap booze.  The hot dogs are innovative and the dog of the week will almost always make you think twice about going with a menu option. That alone is enough to make it worthwhile to come out here.  But seriously, where else are you going to find $3 pours of whiskey in this day and age?"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to try a hot dog, but to my great disappointment the Whiskey Dogg is no longer. They were sold a couple weeks ago and the establishment is now called Second Level or something, but they still haven't changed their signs outside. The workers were just lounging around and watching TV as no one else was inside. Seems like a hole in the wall kind of bar/restaurant. They have a completely different menu, nothing special, just regular plain bar food: burger, hot dog, fries. Nothing unique or appealing so I just left."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Whiskey Dogg. Not only is the food and service great but the prices are so reasonable its crazy.  You cant beat their happy hour either: All hot dogs are $3 and half off any of their whiskey drinks. I had the Tombstone and the Doc Holiday. Both were awesome.  I love the fact they make their own ketchup and they serve stadium mustard. Thats the only mustard that should ever hit a hot dog IMHO.  My only issue is the parking is going to stink when they get busier. And good luck making a left out of there.  But that being said, we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great atmosphere! Just go, you won't be let down!  I got the Cosby dogg and it was amazing! Never thought I would have a hot dog wrapped in a burger, but I did, and I loved it! So many great options on the menu. Can't wait to go again and try another crazy dog!  The whiskey and beer menu is huge as well! Also, the art on the walls is cool. Nothing I've ever seen in North Olmsted! Cool concept!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon, met a couple of friends for lunch so it wasn't all that busy. Drinks were great, the selection was outstanding. We ordered a few beers, bloody mary and of course whiskey. The menu was very enticing, a lot to choose from with a variety of ingredients. We started with the sea salt and cracked pepper fries & chili fries both of which were very good.  I got the Whiskey Dogg for my meal, and I wasn't too thrilled. The bun was a bit dry, and the homemade BBQ was incredibly spicy. It burned my mouth and made the rest of the meal completely not enjoyable after that.  I like spicy food and sauces as much as the next guy, but there was no indication on the menu or from our server that it was a spicy homemade BBQ. When I asked our server, what made it so spicy she simply replied \" I don't know, they put peppers in it\" and took our empty paper bowls and walked away. I was appalled at this, I would hope they'd have a bit more knowledge on what goes into the food or would ask the cook on my behalf since it's homemade it should be something that they'd be proud of.  The atmosphere and drinks were good,  however I would not go back for the food. :("}
{"text":"Within the hour of me being here on a Saturday afternoon I heard the Stones and Iggy and the Stooges come over the radio.  That in of itself deserves 5 stars.  My lil one and I walked in and we were the only ones in the place and I didnt mind a bit.  Had it been fuller I feel it could have a hipster vibe and I would end up insuling someone or calling out a supposedly straight dude on his fruity footwear of choice.  Its got more of a bar feel than a restaurant as well so bringing little ones is advisable earlier than later.  The bartender kid was super nice and genuine, unlike a lot of these new joints.  I actually saw him the very next Sunday at the Beachland so that better reinforces my thoughts of good music + non fake people = a genuinely good time!  Good to see Joe from the old Edison days too running the place.  The beer selection is great!   Canned old man beers are good for when I get tired of paying 5-6 dollars for a jar of draft.  Nice option to have.  I had a few in me even before the tubed goodness got to the table.  The dawgs came out quick.  With stuff like this prep is key (Mies en Place for all you overnight foodies).  I got some bacon wrapped dog and she got nuts and tried the one with peanut butter.  Both were awesome and fresh no doubt!  Glad to see a new place open up thats original and not following the Tremont, Ohio City sheep.."}
{"text":"A very strong three stars that I expect to upgrade at some point. This is a great concept that's pretty well executed. The dogs themselves are excellent, though I wish they had natural casings. The sauces are creative and tasty. The fresh cut fries were good, but needed a bit more crisping. The slaw was inoffensive but bland. Given the name, I wish they had more whiskeys available, and a few more local brews on tap would be nice to see. All those quibbles aside, I really like the place and I'll return for more tubular delights soon."}
{"text":"we love, love, love this place........a kind of dive/hole in the wall type of place, great & creative cocktails, good selection of beers.....the hot dogs, LOVE 'EM!!!!! nothing else to eat but dogs and a few side dishes, but they do them so well.....the seoul dog was my favorite.....kimchi, cream cheese, onion crisps....so unusual, but SO good. tasted  4 different dogs and they were all done SO well.....a great little, emphasis on LITTLE, neighborhood joint that offers great drinks, divey atmosphere, with good dogs and super cheap prices.......a great any time place.........would HIGHLY recommend, we'll be back, FO' SHO'...............doin' it doggy style at whiskey dogg!!!"}
{"text":"We checked out Whiskey Dogg a few nights ago since we were in the mood to try something new. Overall, we liked it quite a bit.   The atmosphere is very hipster cool - this place would fit right in in Ohio City or Tremont. But here it is in North Olmstead.....I know right?? Nice to have something a bit younger and unique out in the West burbs.  The menu is just big enough (not 8 billion options like at Happy Dog). Not that 8 billion options is bad, it's just sometimes nice to have a short list of items to pick from and that's that.   I tried the slaw dog - cole slaw, jalape√±os, beer cheese sauce. Sean had the Seoul Dog which has cream cheese, kimchi and some other stuff on it. I would say we both liked our dogs but weren't amazed by them. On mine, the cheese sauce didn't seem to go that well with the other toppings although the toppings on their own were quite tasty. Sean liked the flavor of the Seoul dog but found it very creamy which he said got old after awhile.   Other good stuff: The buns are more substantial to the usual hot dog buns which is nice. The fries were quite tasty also. They have Mickey's hand grenades for $3! Took Sean back to his college days throwing the empty bottles at passing trains. They had quite an interesting list of whiskey cocktails that I'm excited to try sometime.   Service was a bit slow but nothing terrible. We were definitely pleased with the experience for the most part and will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I'm not a hot dog kind of gal. These are the real deal though. The kind with the casing that snaps when you bite into em. Might I even say that they're better than that other hot dog place?  Anyways, went here last night after trying to get into fatheads. They had an hour wait, forget that. Walked right in to whiskey dogg and got served right away. They have a smaller, but decent beer selection and everything is decently priced. I ordered the Seoul dog and it was delicious! So were the fries and beer cheese dip. And all together, it cost my friend and I $30 with tip.   You can't find a better deal on a Saturday night!   Oh, and the artwork on the walls is fantastic! Plus I liked that they played decent music in the background-without it being overstated. I heard some old Rancid and was brought back to high school in an instant."}
{"text":"This may be the perfect restaurant! Young fun atmosphere, awesome prices, fast service, and tons of options. This place is great!   Tons of great bottled beers and whiskey (hence the name) to sip while you browse all of the wacky hotdog options.   I went with the cincinati skyline dog and that comes topped with chili, beer cheese sauce, and bacon. The perfect chili cheese dog, I will def order this again! My other half ordered the philly cheese dog and the banana peanut butter dog. The Philly cheese dog was also top notch. They convinced us to try the vegan dog because it's really spicy and pairs well with the banana, I must say it wasn't dry at all like I expected. Great vegan dog if that's your thing. We also split the sea salt and cracked pepper fries and being condiment lovers we had to get the dippin dots sauces. The fries are like carnival fries and the curry aioli will linger in my dreams.    Another thing to note is the prices. $4 for these hotdogs makes me feel like I'm robbing the place. But I'm not complaining. Come during happy hour (4-7 mon-fri) for $3 hot dogs."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at Whiskey Dogg as I type this, and I must say, quite frank-ly, that it is quite a Kraut-pleaser. I Relish-ed my delicious Veggie Corn Dog. I've been wanting to come since it opened and luckily I was finally able to ketchup and check it out.   My friend said that the pickle on her Muni Lot dog was dill-icious.    Don't be a wiener! Mustard up some appetite and get your buns down to Whiskey Dogg!   Our condiments to the chef!"}
{"text":"Hot Dogs and Whiskey....what could really go wrong here. The prices were amazing especially at happpy hour! Cant beat 3$ whiskey drinks and 3$ dogs. They drinks were all creative and delicious. Our bartender was great! The only thing I will say is that I was not a huge fan of the breading on the dippy dog. Other than that a great place to eat with friends! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Everything was good!!   Atmosphere was right. Service was good. Timing was perfect. (They were pretty dead though - esp for a Saturday night)  I got the special, the Jalape√±o Popper Dog. Also got salt n pepper fries and the dippin' dots sauces. Those were awesome. The BBQ sauce and habanero aioli are especially yummy.   The only negative is their beer selection. I'm a dark beer fan, so when they only had Youngs for me, and then they were out of that, I had to settle (not a big deal though - they are just REALLY heavy on IPAs).   The only reason it doesn't get a full five is just b/c it's nothing too special. The dogs were good, but I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"$4 all beef hot dogs!   We stopped in for a bite for dinner.  Had the Philly Dog and the Windy City Dog. Both were good. Buns were a nice pretzel bun. We also had an order of the fries. Good but nothing special. The ketchup was strange though - kind of chunky and not very flavorful.  Also tried a few drinks - I had the Tombstone which was root-beer and whiskey. Pretty tasty.   Service was typical for a bar, kind of slow. There seemed to be a lot of people working there but only one person taking orders/waiting tables.   In and out for $21 (2 people, one drink a piece) - can't beat that.   For what this place is - a bar that serves hot dogs - it hits the spot. This is almost a 4 star review. Would have given it 4 stars except for the weird ketchup and slow service."}
