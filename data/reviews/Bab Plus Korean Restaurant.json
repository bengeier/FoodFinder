{"text":"Often times people who have traveled often and had more than just tourist food have a lot to say. I'll be one of these people, but allow me to explain why exactly this rating is as it is with some level of validity. These 3 stars do not mean that it is average by any means, but this is merely my baseline for food that passes. I, as a Korean have had many different types of Korean food ranging from restaurants to my own grandparents, the latter being my personal favorite. While this restaurant does not by my standards make me crave it's food, when I get the craving, it is good enough to suffice. The flavors utilized are by no means lacking, but I have had better. All in all, the food here is good enough to supplement my tastebuds after having been away from home so relatively long, and I would certainly consider this one of the finer Korean restaurants in the Urbana area. If you haven't already, give this place a chance, I'm fairly certain that you won't be disappointed, and if you are, you can blame me for false advertisement.   PS: I don't work here, just a customer"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants on campus, and my always-go-to menu is seafood Soon Doo Boo. However, the problem is that the seafood portion in Soon Doo Boo is getting smaller and smaller each time I try, which is very disappointing compared to what I used to get when the place first opened. Today, I went there with my two other friends who are not regulars, and one of them who ordered shrimp fried rice, for the first time thinking that it would be similar to Kofushion in terms of number of shrimps, was completely disappointed by the quantity of shrimp (see photo attached: they're not even full-sized shrimp, but small chopped pieces of shrimps), which was unacceptable compared to what she gets from Kofusion on the opposite side of the street. I hope the owner would realize that they're losing touch and that they should improve this issue."}
{"text":"I like the beef bone soup. However , the instant ramen they used was expired and tasted terrible. Overall, though , the the quality of the rest of the food was excellent ."}
{"text":"Bap Plus is arguably the best Korean place on campus.   I've eaten at Woori Jib and Arirang and despite the fact that those places are pretty expensive, the quality and taste has never been very good in my opinion and I've never felt like I've gotten my money's worth when eating there.   Additionally, Bap Plus is clean and has a cute interior (very similar to restaurants you'd find in Asia. A close comparison would be to Spoon House's decor.) Essentially, you go up to the register, pick what you want and pay for it then they give you a pager. You bus your own tables and get your own water/utensils. When your food is ready, you can go up to the counter, trade your pager for a tray with your order on it, then bring it back to wherever you're sitting. The plating is really nice and the presentation is simple and well done. You generally get a soup, some banchan (side dishes), and rice with your order.  I always get Tonkatsu! The portion is huge and it tastes delicious! (It comes with some sort of fermented radish, miso soup, rice, and a piece of tonkatsu bigger than a person's head with brown ponzu sauce.)  Pros: Good portion sizes Good food Really good maintenance of the interior (not a speck of dirt in sight!) Brightly lit interior The tables aren't too close together and you can move them to accommodate more people easily Fast service Authentic food Comfy seats  Cons (there aren't a lot, this is me getting super nit-picky): There isn't a lot of variety. The menu has maybe 25 things on it and while those things are solid, I sometimes wish that there were more options! There isn't a rug at the door so be careful of slipping if you're coming in on a rainy day since there's usually a puddle near the door"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located around the South Quad area on campus. Compared to Korean places around town, I would consider this place alright, nothing special. For one, their portion sizes are pretty large. I'd be happy if they served half the food for half the price. You'll definitely be spending around $10 for each entree.  The tonkatsu is alright. It is very large, but don't be deceived - the meat is so thinly pounded and the breading thick (lots of frying), so definitely not a healthy option.  Sulungtang here is pretty standard as well. A safe choice here, but not a lot of meat in the soup.  The rabokki here is meh here. It just tastes like dukbokki but with a small amount of ramen noodles."}
{"text":"This restaurant feels clean and tidy. Food quality is not very consistent here but still one of the best Korean places on campus. Their beef short rib soup is the best!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants on campus. More authentic than the Korean restaurants on green street with a very large menu! My go to is always the bibimbap stone bowl (I always ask for tofu); the portions are huge and the veggies are fresh with a perfectly cooked fried egg. They give you a whole bottle of sauce so you can make it as spicy as you please! I always wait a couple minutes before mixing the bowl together so that the rice on the bottom crisps up. This restaurant is always very clean, minimal wait time, and friendly workers. Most of the orders come with a side of rice, miso soup, and/or yellow pickled radishes... you will not leave this place hungry! Vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"A better version of Spoonhouse, because the chef is Korean. Some of the pork dish that I have tried can be a little salty. But I enjoyed eating soondooboo, thukboki, and spicy squid stir fry."}
{"text":"I am surprised how inconsistent their food can be!  I ordered Gamja-tang and it tasted fine, but there was no potato inside. If it really was their way of doing it, it should be have been fine. Nevertheless it tasted good. But today, my companion ordered Gamja-tang again and there was a potato inside!  Now I cannot recommend anybody to go to this restaurant, since there is no guarantee that they would be served of the same dish that I liked......"}
{"text":"Considering it is a Korean restaurant, not the best in town. Many people order the pork cutlet because it will only fill you up at a decent student price. The side soup should be warm but it's cold, kimchi should be fresh and cold but it taste like it's been outside for hours. Other options are not recommended because when they come out they are not hot like they should be. Also I feel the employees are not fully trained to take the order. Extremely disappointed. By the way they made my girlfriend sick after she ate the food. No wonder they got shut down couple times."}
{"text":"One way to tell how good a Korean restaurant may be is by its bi bim bop. For about $10, I received a miso soup, a bowl of rice, some pickled radish, & a large bowl filled with chopped romaine, bi bim bop toppings, & a sunny side up egg. A bottle of gochugung (hot sauce) accompanies the meal so you can personalised the spicy level. The food was well executed - very tasty - though it wasn't piping hot.   Located on the east side of campus, away from the busyness of Green, this area seems a bit more chill. The place is clean & well lit, strewn with tables that accommodate up to 4 people. The staff talked amongst themselves while taking my order. But hey, I'm there for the food not the chit chat. You bus your own table & bring the finished tray up to the \"return\" window.   All in all, the food was decent, the place was clean, the portions were good, & I left full & satisfied."}
{"text":"I disagree with the reviewer below(Yum Y.) Bibimbap is one of the \"safe\" menus that I order at Korean restaurants because it's near to impossible to make terrible bibimbap.   Another safe menu for me is fried rice. That said, I ordered shrimp fried rice at this establishment a couple weeks ago and was shocked at the poor quality. Basically it was just a huge mound of rice with a few tiny shrimps here and there and some egg. The price of this dish was around ten dollars including tax.   Upon expressing my disappointment, they offered to make me another one but I just asked for a refund. I've tried other stuff here too and overall the food was mediocre at best and overpriced for a cafeteria-like environment where there's no one waiting on you."}
{"text":"Good environment but the food l tried was really not worth it. I ordered Seol leong tang, which is a soup with beef and noodles and costed 10 dollars: the bowl is really big, but besides a few pieces of sliced beef and noodles, 95% of it is just water broth. If you think you can feed yourself on this (plus a small bowel of rice and a side of preserved vegetables), go ahead and try it, but l bet you will be hungry within 2 hours."}
{"text":"Went to try this place for lunch on Tuesday, September 29, 2015.  I was greeted by a sign on the door that they had been closed by the health department. That can't be good...  See the photo."}
{"text":"Along with Woori Jib, this is one of my favorite Korean restaurants on campus. I love the bright clean atmosphere inside, and there's a decent amount of seating. It can get a little crowded during peak hours, but that's to be expected.  My favorite item on the menu are the Soon Tofu Soup (spicy) which is less salty than Woori Jib's and is served with a raw egg. The Galbi Tang (if you want something light) is also very good if you like clear soups. Both of these dishes are served with rice and fermented radishes. If this is your first time eating Korean, they have a wonderful fried rice selection and their Tonkatsu is amazing! It has a huge portion with great flavor, so definitely check it out! If you're not a fan of super sweet ddukbokki, don't get it here.  Another reason I love this place is their bathrooms. Super clean and well stocked, I really appreciate the effort from this establishment. Kudos."}
{"text":"This place is good but not great.  I have to say compared to the other places you can soups on campus this place does not really stick out.  I much prefer Woori Jib in Champaign but the portions here are bigger.  The broth is not as refined as its competitor but not bad.  The second time I went here, I ordered bulgogi beef and I have to say it impressed me a lot more than the soup I ordered the first time.  I found the quality of meat to be pretty good and the entire dish to be overall tasty.  However, it was not cheap I ended up paying closer to 14$."}
{"text":"Finally, a Korean restaurant on campus that is actually good! As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was in a Korean restaurant. The place was packed, took 5 minutes to get an open table. Their menu was limited for the first couple of weeks (according to the restaurant, they will open their full menu soon), but there were still enough choices to choose from.  My dish (Seol Leong Tang) came out really quickly, and it is easily the best on campus. My friends enjoyed their Kalbi Tang, Bu Dae Jigae, and Dduk Mandu Guk as well! We each paid a little over $10 as expected for all of the Korean restaurants, and it was definitely worth my money. Excited to come back when they have their full menu up!"}
{"text":"Bab Plus is one of my favorite restaurants on campus so it breaks my heart to see that they only have three stars! My boyfriend and I visit once a week and I always get the beef tofu soup. The flavor is always good and the portions are decent sized for the price you pay (prices are comparable to the other Korean restaurants on campus). Another thing I love about this restaurant is its decor! It feels very homey (especially the bathrooms)! The women bathroom is extremely tidy and they even have two-ply toilet paper! All in all, I've always had a positive experience at Bab Plus, and it'll be sorely missed when I graduate this month! :("}
{"text":"I've been twice and both times the food was delicious.  The place is very clean. The woman that took my order (both times) seemed friendly but the place is packed so there's no time to stand around and speak pleasantries.  I saw they were closed once by the health department on a prior review, however the reason for their closing wasn't something food related (no bugs, spoiled food, etc) so this shouldn't be a mark against them.  The only reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is because I think it is slightly overpriced (most students are broke or broke-ish except maybe the international students).  Also the short ribs in the gal bi tang were really huge pieces.  The amount of meat was ok but at least needs to be cut up more so the soup can be consumed easily."}
{"text":"Good foods good environment and clean utensils. Overall it's a good place to go if you want enjoy some relatively authentic Korean Food. The Gal Bi is really delicious. Btw, one thing to improve is its staff's attitude and niceness lol"}
{"text":"This restaurant's taste and environment deserve 4 star. Food is delicious?Just...too much meat and too few vegetables."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and was served with an acrid burnt soup and some cold rice. Would not recommend this joint for anyone looking for half way decent tasting Korean food"}
{"text":"They've failed a food inspection and my once favorite dish was recently ruined with some salmonella. The kimchi fried rice comes with raw egg if that's down your alley."}
{"text":"Ordered a short rib soup with starch noodle from the picture on the menu. Received something completely different."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I don't know why there are so many negative reviews and I used to laugh at the picture that was used for the front page of this restaurant which was the big red sign when they got closed for a health code violation as this is quite a good Korean restaurant. Compared to the other restaurants here this place actually has a leg up on its competition. It actually is very clean, well lit, great portions, and friendly staff. I realize that you can't always trust the reviews for relatively new restaurants. The ordering process is very simple you just walk up and and check out the limited menu of 23 items. I should've went with something different however I ended up getting the boo dae jji gae which cost 10.99 which is a spicy soup that has ham, sausage, meatballs, vegetables, and Ramen noodle. Compared to K-Bowl I felt that they actually had a larger portion size. The soup itself is not a spicy which I'm okay with however you want the very spicy Korean soup I can see why some of the other reviews don't say that this is as authentic. Next time I'll have to try the pork cutlet which seems to be very popular item. I would like to also comment on how clean this restaurant is. Finally the other nice thing about this restaurant is that it actually has a bathroom unlike K-Bowl. I definitely will be back to try the other foods on this menu.  Pros: Very clean, well lit, great portions, friendly staff, self serve no need to TIP, they have a restroom  Cons: Limited menu, no free tea (although K-Bowl does not have either)  Hidden deals: Great prices already, unfortunately not aware of any special deals. No need to TIP, self serve and tray return after you are done eating  Health code rating: A. Likely the cleanness Korean restaurant in Champaign even though they were closed initially for violations. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2238"}
{"text":"Homely decor. Okay service, nothing that can be complained about.   I went there within the first month of its opening, but was let down by the lack of meat in my dish. I had paid more than $10 dollars for three slices of meat, soup, and rice. Despite the big bowl, looks can be deceiving. I went there a second time with friends who have never tried it, and the food portions were just as ridiculous. If you have money to spend, I'd suggest elsewhere."}
