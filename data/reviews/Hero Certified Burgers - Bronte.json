{"text":"Everytime I go to fast food joints,  I always see something that makes me question the cleanliness of the place,  but this restaurant was really clean and for that reason,  they'll have me as a repeat customer. All in all, I had an amazing experience here,  the staff was super friendly and the food was delicious. I placed an order for 16 people and though my order was huge,  they didn't make any mistakes which is unusual at fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome, fries are amazing and the staff  is nice and friendly.  We have been to this location  several times and it is always a pleasure. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how impressed we were with this burger place. It was clean, bright and had some of the friendliest and most helpful staff we have encountered. This is a basically a franchise fast food joint but you certainly don't get that impression from this location. The choices for burgers rival some of the expensive high end burger places we frequent and they are delicious. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. This will always be a favourite stop whenever we are in the neighbourhood."}
