{"text":"The menu seems more fitting for a downtown restaurant than their location in a suburban strip mall would suggest. However, as other reviewers noted, we quickly forgot the location as we settled into the nicely decorated room.

We started with two different soups - both outstanding.  My wife had a jalapeño and bacon soup with a puffed pastry that had lots of flavor and a smooth,creamy texture.  For my opener,  I sampled  a perfectly spiced Thai seafood chowder with lots of body and beautifully tender shrimp. 

My wife's main of  lobster mac and cheese had great flavors but was a little overcooked leading to slightly greasy texture. My Creole steak was a winner, changing up an ordinary filet mignon by topping it with chorizo sausage, caramelized onions, more perfectly cooked shrimp and roast peppers in a tomato base for a beautifully balanced sauce. 

A rich carrot cake topped off a delicious and very reasonably priced dinner. 
Suggestion to the owners - lose the tv's and the paper napkins to be taken seriously as the kind of establishment your food suggests you that you are:)

The chef ensured our return with his gracious offer of free dessert when informed we thought the Mac cheese had been slightly overcooked.   This could be our new favorite neighborhood resto!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  We found it online and took a chance on it, and I am so glad we did.  The service was fantastic, and our crab cakes, wine, grilled salmon and steak sandwich were so good.  I've been recommending it to people and wouldn't hesitate to go back.  And good pricing too.

I see they do take-home dishes - if you call them in the afternoon, rhey will have the food prepared for you for dinnertime.  Looks yummy!

It is too bad it's in a strip mall near a gas station, but you don't think of that once you're inside."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in the West island. They have an international menu that really Respects is origins. The flavors are diverse and the ambiance is warm and cozy. I would recommend coming at sunset. The wine prices are very good and the menu boasts an average of 18$ / plate with generous portions. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Tried this place out this past weekend because we had a LivingSocial coupon to use up! So glad we did. My boyfriend and I both ordered table d'hotes, I got the grilled salmon with fresh veggies and jasmine rice and he ordered the filet mignon. My piece of salmon was quite large, and they even included 4 shrimps atop it. The veggies were deliciously steamed with a little butter, and the rice was fluffy and aromatic. Tasted like a comfy home cooked meal x 1000. My boyfriend raved about his steak and potatoes. A little expensive, but definitely worth it :) The waitresses were super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Loved the service and the food. The jambalaya, Vietnamese salad and the calamari were succulent. Would definitely come back. A hidden gem in the west island."}
{"text":"Fabulous service, beautiful presentation but my crab cakes were burnt and cold and my blackened salmon was dry and didn't taste like much.  Too bad cuz I would have loved to give a good review.  
Will I go back?  Maybe, cuz maybe it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"J' ai commandé une salade césar façon Bistro Merlot.
Romaine avec vinaigrette césar et chips de Prosciutto. Malheureusement , très ordinaire comme salade qui n' est pas donnée.
En plat principale ce fut une pizza mince 'West Island' avec piment fort. Tres bonne pizza, beaucoup de garniture. Excellent choix de vins au verre. J' ai pu commander un sauvignon blanc. Le café allongé était parfait.
Le service de Kelly a était très professionnel et amical.
Le stationnement est facile.
J' y retourne pour essayer autres plats."}
{"text":"Dined here last Saturday and am giving the restaurant a provisional three stars...will go back and hopefully add a fourth. 

The service was friendly and efficient...so full marks there. 

The food is fine, but the wine list is a bit pricey....almost 300% over SAQ. However given this is a very small place, they need to bring in profit somehow. And it is an interesting little wine list, so I won't whine about that.

We ordered Calamari and crab cakes to start. The calamari is very well prepared...tender and crispy, not greasy or rubbery - a dish I would order again. The crab cakes....not so much. It wasn't that they were bad, they just weren't good - kind of feh...not so interesting. Also, both the calamari and crab cakes relied on a spicy mayo or some other mayonnaise concoction...not a fan. Not sure why quality food prepared well needs a boost, but the mayo dips don't work for me.

I ordered the sea bass which was cooked perfectly. Not dry or stiff, but rather very moist and succulent. Obviously the chef is skilled. It came with a cold quinia side ( not a fan) but I found a cold salad odd with this. And the grilled veggies were well prepared. Portion size is large...you won't go hungry. 

My companion ordered the salmon...which was huge. And, according to her and my tasting was very well prepared. She also had a green salad that was abundant and fresh with a nice dressing that did not overwhelm 

Dessert was shared and the daily crime brûlée was very good.

Over all I would return here both with kids and as a place for a quiet dinner for two. The rest of the menu looks quite interesting and the other plates passing us looked very good. 

So for now three stars...and upon my return...in the next few weeks...will hope to boost this to four after trying the other options."}
{"text":"We went to Bistro Merlot for a dinner birthday celebration. The food was very good.  
I had the jambalaya and it was nice and spicy with large shrimp. My only quibble would be that the sausage was sliced pepperoni thin and was a  bit dry..
The birthday girl enjoyed her meal very much. 
The restaurant requires some changes to  the decor. 
It's too open and not very intimate. Mostly white walls and overly bright lighting. Dividers and plants would help.
Service was very good. 
Congratulations to chef Kyle and his staff."}
{"text":"The restaurant also offers catering for events.  I went to a party yesterday that had been catered by Bistro Merlot.  The menu for this is different from the restaurant one but is still really good.  There was a variety of hors d'oeuvres, salads and main dishes.  My favourite by far was the quesadilla or the latkes with smoked salmon and creme fraiche."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!  The jalapeno bacon soup was incredible, as was the lobster mac and cheese.  The staff were super friendly, the decor was inviting, and the restaurant was clean.  Highly recommend this place if you're ever in the Montreal area."}
{"text":"Bistro Merlot is great for both lunch and dinner. The varied menu is both interesting and excellent. Everyone in the group enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"This place is great!  

First of the person who took our reservation was super nice and extremely polite.  She suggested that we make our reservation a little later so we don't get caught up waiting to long for our food due to a party that was there.

The service was quick and done with a smile the whole time.  But not a fake smile a genuine one.
The place is kind of small but it's neat because you can watch the cooks work.

My girlfriend and I each ordered from the table d'hote.  They were each 30$ sh had salmon and I had filet mignon, each were extrodinary.  
We also got calamari which had to be some of the best we had ever had.

All in all a greAt experience."}
