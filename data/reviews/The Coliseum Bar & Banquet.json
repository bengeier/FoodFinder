{"text":"Good sports bar atmosphere....go there for beer 'n' Badgers, but not the food.  The nachos were the worst I've ever had--seriously.  And what was that other horrendous concoction?  Oh yes. PIZZA QUESADILLAS.  if it had been up to me, I wouldn't have ordered it, because...C'MON, MAN!  Pizza. Quesadillas.  Two words that have no business being next to each other.  And as expected...Really. Truly. Disgusting.  But the Hopalicious was A-okay."}
{"text":"Had the same experience as Bartleby F.  We had a group of 10 and struggled getting a drink order placed. The server only took 3 orders at a time and had to be reminded to ask the others at the table. Trying to place a food order was frustrating. We noticed 2 meals were delivered and the rest of us weren't even asked. I finally caught our server and told her we'd like to order.  I received my meal and noticed she never took orders from the others. This is long enough but havent even touched on the billing ... you get the jest of it"}
{"text":"The beer selection was pretty good, but the food was SO bad!  I got a burger that was suppose to come with guacamole but it turned out to be that chip dip that contains less than 10% avocado!  After 2 bites, I sent it back and asked for it to be removed from our bill.  You can believe the negative reviews!"}
{"text":"Always come here before games during state hockey tournament weekend. They are always accommodating to the large groups and get us our food quickly. Pizza is a great staple when I come here!"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour so this review is limited in its scope.  The outside looks pretty ostentatious and the inside is wannabe college bar style except that it's huge.  Even at 5-5:30 it felt empty even though there were quite a few people there and the parking lot was full.  This wasn't necessarily a bad thing since I hate crowds.  There was no college atmosphere and nothing to really make the bar stand out.  Drinks:  I had bloody marys and they were average.  Nothing spectacular but not bad in any way.  Food: I tried the onion straws.  :-/  The menu said they were home-made.  Taking the frozen product out of the bag and putting it in your deep frier doesn't count as home cooking.  They were tasty but beyond greasy and about as commercial looking as you can get.  Service: Service rocked the house!  This is the only thing that saves this place.  Warm, friendly, attentive but not over-bearing.  I can honestly say that this is where service needs to be at any establishment.  Kudos to the staff!"}
{"text":"I had never been here before, a fact which greatly amused our bartender. I was not disappointed in our experience at all- good drink prices, great bar staff (seriously) and a really good reuben were all we needed to have a nice time."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick lunch as I had some meetings at a nearby hotel. The service was good and my meal came out really fast and was very enjoyable even though I was in a hurry. The staff was friendly, I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Came here after Brattyball because it was across the street and our team had a gift card.  I ordered chips and gauc and Buffalo Salad.   Surprisingly, the guac looked and tasted like it was freshly made to order. I was completely expecting a container of Wholly Guacamole or something but no this was, dare I say it, Chipotle quality?!  Of course there were way more chips than there was guac or the verde salsa that it came with but eh, I'm just so happy the guac was fresh!  The salad was less exciting, your run-of-the-mill bar salad. Though, it came with micro-greens instead of iceberg lettuce. Touche Coliseum! The chicken tasted and looked to be Sysco-esque with the buffalo sauce clearly an afterthought.   For $9.29 you can do better with one of their wraps or sandwiches."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is typical sports bar, nothing fancy.  I've eaten here several times for lunch, and the menu has variety so there is always something for everyone. I usually order a Greek wrap which is large and too big for me to finish.  I recently ate here for dinner on a Wed nite, due to reading a review about the nachos and decided that sounded good.  Got the chicken 1/2 nachos and a beer.  My food came quickly and yes my eyes bugged out when the plate of nachos was placed in front of me. Needless to say I wasn't able to finish it, but I do say I made a valiant effort."}
{"text":"Great location for any game or event at the Alliant Energy Center or Coliseum. I've walked, biked, and taken this bar's complimentary shuttle from the bar. The shuttle is a big yellow school bus with a friendly driver; it was jam packed in a return ride from a Capitols game recently.  In my most recent visit, we all ordered 1/2 nachos and split then amongst couples. Even the 1/2 order was too much for any couple to finish. I enjoyed the guac but we all wanted more black beans. The food came out quickly. Decent beer selection; I think we settled on Inaugural Red(?). Staff was not attentive (i.e. we had to use the bar staff instead of waiter a few times), however they were quite slammed."}
{"text":"Good bar to go to before and after many events.  Good bar food and beer selection.  They offer a free shuttle to and from Badger football and basketball games."}
{"text":"Service was inattentive, wings were super greasy and the meat in my Ruben was tough and chewy.  At least I didn't get ill from eating here."}
{"text":"I had never been to this bar, but some friends wanted to meet there so I did.     The outside looked better than the inside and the inside once you were in was really kinda boring.  Need pictures on the walls or something or colors.    Reminded me of a banquet hall.       I did not eat any food.  The service was pretty bad.  I was actually in a seperate bar from the main one and they was 2 bartenders.  They both were good looking, but it stopped there.     Immediately when I got there, my friend was going to buy me a drink but instead walked to the main bar to get our drinks, because the 2 bartenders took forever to their drinks before.      When i finished my second drink, the bartender asked me if I wanted another one and I replied yes.  He went back to the bar and I watched him literally sitting there counting his tips!!   It took so long(10 min?) that I walked to the main bar where the service was better and then ordered a drink.  When I got back to my seat it appeared the bartender finally remembered my drink. What a good surprise??   I left an appropiate 25 cent tip.     My whole table of 7 was thinking of the bad service.        There is a alot of bars out there, not to mention ones with tvs.  Find another place."}
{"text":"Home coming weekend. And packed crowd!  I was in Madison for a wedding and the after party was here. The staff was pretty attentive considering the crowd. Got my local brewed beer and hung out with my friends.  One of my friends got the nachos. They were huge! And really good. Instead of melted nacho cheese (which I can appreciate) they melted a bunch of shredded cheddar. And topped it with awesomeness. Loaded.  I was told the waffle fries and the quesadilla was really good too."}
{"text":"Just stopped in with family to enjoy Saturday afternoon meal with Living Social deal. First-other couple with is had own separate deal, and waitress wouldn't allow us to sit together with separate bills. The waitress acted like I she didn't need any tip, answering with 1 words and acting cocky. Then after throwing a fit, she came back and told us that Living Social made \"a mistake and 20% was auto added to bill\". A lie. When I asked \"Manager\" about it, he called out that there was an event across the street and they didn't even have to allow the deals. Btw, 3 other people in the place.   How dumb of this place to lose my business as well as the other 50 people I will tell about this. Can't believe that they think they can treat families this way and still stay profitable. Unfortunately, I will make up for that 20% faster than they will. College dropouts running grills don't work, Owners!!!!"}
{"text":"Good selection, nice atmosphere for a sports bar. We were tired and this was close to our destination. Great wait staff too"}
{"text":"The Coliseum Bar Pizza was excellent. I had the Roasted Vegetable and my wife had the Cheese with Black and Green Olives. They were the nine inch which are plate sized. No leftovers but the perfect size when you are looking to not have any."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is my third or fourth review of this place. Looking back since the night of the pretty bad fish fry - I realize I've been here a few more times (It's pretty close to my house) and things have improved. They have pretty good pizza - crisp and tasty. Last time we were there, had a perfectly poured Guinness and some nachos. Hard to screw up, but both were good. Seems like service is still hit and miss, but the place is ok. Just nothing jumping out to make me love it."}
{"text":"We went because we had a coupon, but we were still disappointed.  While the bar was hoppin' during \"happy hour\" the restaurant wasn't.  Now I know why.  The salad bar contained containers of  tired looking iceberg lettuce, orange colored tomatoes, mushy cucumbers and some carrots.  My food was also boring and uninspired.  The burger I had was overcooked.  The fries my boyfriend ordered were the highlight of the meal. That isn't saying much.   I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on Saturday night before a show at the coliseum, it was packed. The service was slow, but they did alright considering how busy they were. The food was alright, the fries were way over seasoned. I got the French dip, and it was good. My wife got a burger that was under cooked, but she said it was good."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I stopped here after a fun run. At first the service was just so so. The bartender seemed confused and impatient, not a fan to wait on us. But, after we mis-ordered our nachos, they swapped them out for us. I felt the love a bit more after that. :) The nachos were good, and big, the four of us couldn't finish them. It was super busy, but there is plenty of seating, inside and out."}
{"text":"The one reason I go to this place is the Haystack burger. Absolutely fantastic. The burger is well seasoned and comes with cajun-spiced mayonnaise that is delicious. The fries that come with it are equally as good. I went at about 8 at night and the music from the bar was quite annoying, there isn't much in terms of ambiance, but it is certainly worth checking out just for the burger.  Edit: The last time I was there the burger was not nearly as good as usual. The kitchen forgot to put the fried onions on our burgers, and when we asked our waitress for them they were not warm and seemed like they had been sitting around all day. Be sure to ask for extra sauce - its the best part but they don't give you much normally."}
{"text":"Great place to swing into when close to Alliant Energy Center. Sam W. Was awesome !! Great Burgers and Pizza. Super fast even when they are packed ! 2nd time in two days and gets better everytime. Worth a stop in."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday night to find the parking lot absolutely full. We were determined to give it a try, and after snagging a spot as someone was leaving, when we got in, the dining area did not reflect the parking lot. Scratching our heads, we sat down and were greeted almost immediately. A PA announcement explained the off-balance parking lot to people ratio; the bar hosts a bus to the Kohl Center and this night was for a hockey game. I'm all for buses and keeping some of that traffic out of down town, but it did make it tricky for others to visit the restaurant. Regardless, our order was taken quickly and the food was served before I finished my soup, and everything was piping hot.  I ordered the 4-piece cod meal with fries, came with a nice helping of cole slaw and tartar sauce. I had a soup choice and got the butternut soup. It clearly didn't fall off the Sysco truck and I asked if they made it there. Indeed they did, and it tasted fresh and home made.  I enjoyed the fish because while deep fried, it was not heavily breaded, a real plus in my book. My companions each had the classic burger cooked to their liking.   While the menu reads \"pub food\" I'd call the quality and service a step up. Food gets four stars, parking situation drops the overall experience a notch. I'm only basing this on the parking for the night we attended, it's probably better most nights."}
{"text":"Generally a good pre-game pre-event stop but when stopping by on a random Tues night not so good. Staff seemed more interested in standing around and yacking.  Sat at bar to get a bite bartenders got me a drink and menu then disappeared.  Well one decided it was dinner time...An annoying visit to say the least."}
{"text":"I have been staying near by on business trips, and there aren't many options in the area.  Luckily, this place is passable.  The staff is pretty friendly, and the food has been fairly good for the most part (for bar food).  Nothing really jumps out as spectacular, but I will probably keep going back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent.  Nothing special but a solid place.  The interior is cold with no real decor.  It hots sand volleyball courts and league nights.  There are also outdoor tables with plenty of distance from the road that you can enjoy your meal.    This is a good no-frills sports bar.  It has great beer specials every night of the week.  I had lunch here.  It was a buffalo chicken caesar wrap with my choice of one of six sides.  I like options.  I ordered the seasoned waffle fries.  I was impressed with the wrap.  It was fresh with good flavor and a nice crunch.    I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  However, the comfort level is ok.  It is all just bar stools and linoleum.    All in all, it is a solid A-ok, three stars."}
{"text":"The service was dodgy.  Our server took one of our drink orders, but not the other.  Then he wanted to take the food order even though we said we wanted a drink first and then we almost forcibly had to get him to take the second drink order.  And then it took forever for the drink to come out.  Everyone was really tense, possibly due to a Republican gathering on site??  It was weird, the overall experience.    The food was good.  I had the turkey bacon wrap and my dining partner had the rueben.  Prices are decent.  Beer choices on draft are a bit weak, but overall we were fine."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my mom after a day of shopping. We just wanted something small to get us to dinner. We tried their house made chips with a jerk dipping sauce. The chips were hot and clearly just out of the fryer. They needed salt though! The sauce tasted like miracle whip with a little nutmeg... Might have been better on dessert... It was odd. I was expecting something super flavorful with a little kick and instead it was sweet and left me feeling confused. It looked great but when I took a bite, meh... Season your chips and maybe offer a different variety of sauces... Something not sweet!"}
{"text":"Great bar with a great atmosphere.  The staff is always so friendly!  Great food, with a wide variety of selections.  This is the perfect place to go for game days because of all the tvs and a great shuttle to the games that's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I went here because one of the other reviewers said there were fat people there.  However, I was sorely disappointed.  There were no fat people, just typical midwesterners and yes they were wearing khakis!  OMG!    But I was longin' for the ill-proportioned sights of morbidly obese peeps spilling out of over-worked dining chairs and bar stools that were screaming for mercy.   So I went to Olive Garden instead.  SCORE!"}
{"text":"So I know I'm not exactly young anymore and apparently I'm not young at heart either.  We walk in here on a Friday night and the music was LOUD!  It was good music and I realize it is a bar & grill but it was at the point where it would be hard to have a conversation and give an accurate order to the waitperson.  We spotted a separate section that was away from the bar where it was noticeably quieter and took a seat there.  Unfortunately, we were asked to move to the main bar area as they were closing that section off.  We were disappointed and considering leaving but we had confirmed our Bucky Book coupon was valid for the night and didn't have any other options so we stuck around.  The waitress was nice and said she'd check with the bartender about the volume.  We took a seat in the main bar area, the volume went down and our experience only improved from there.  They have a very impressive menu for being a bar you go to prior to going to a concert at the Alliant Energy Center.  Hubby was intrigued by the fact he could get gyro meat on his Caesar salad and ordered that without a second thought.  I opted for the roasted veggie wrap in an effort to choose something a bit more healthy although I admit, I did stick with the French fries that come with it instead of choosing another side.  Both meals were great.  The gyro meat really added a new twist to a Caesar salad and although a pile of cheese curds (we saw them when the someone else's order came to our table and they looked AWESOME) would be more tasty than a veggie wrap, it was still delicious and a great choice.  The bill came, and with discount, it was under $13 with a 20% gratuity added!  They undercharged for the salad so the automatic tip was less than $3.  We went ahead and added to the tip since, in the end, it all worked out and we got quite a deal for the two of us.  We'll be back, but likely it will just be the two of us versus a small group that we might want to maintain a conversation with."}
{"text":"Standard American fare with friendly service! I would go here on occasion because I worked nearby.   I would say that the \"chicken bacon ranch wrap\" is a tasty bet!"}
{"text":"Here are some fake news headlines about this place:  Sports bar opens in former haunted building,  hosts annoyed by smell of fried food and perpetually wet floors  Suspicious mass on local pub burger analyzed \"it's not bbq, it's people!\" exclaims overly-excited scientist  Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\" responsible for altercation at local watering hole, \"I was born this way!\" screams enraged customer  Bar patron drinks gasoline from own car on dare, hospitalized  Shuttle bus to bar stopped, returned to hotel when riders deemed \"too annoying\"  ===  2 stars because even though I would never go here again, it serves its purpose: a sports bar for Badger fans, and a pre-game spot for concerts/events at the Alliant. by all means go here if that's your M.O."}
{"text":"Had spotted cow on tap.  Stayed at hotel down the street, food options are somewhat limited.  Had a cowboy burger = bacon, burger, cheese, onion fritters and BBQ sauce.    Overall, sat at bar, service was good.  Lots of people in bar playing volleyball outside or having a drink after work.    Would come back, just nothing super great about the place.  Price was good, 2 spotted cows, burger and fries came to $14 an some change."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of months ago with a couple friends after an event at the energy center. We walked in and there was an empty table towards the front so we immediately sat down.   The place was moderately busy, but not unmanageable. We talked while we waited for a server to bring us menus.... And waited.... And waited....   Half hour goes by and not even a \"I'll be right with you\" from any server. We weren't completely unnoticed though since one of the waitresses was talking to her friends the next table over and blatantly saw us there.  So we got up and left. First & last time we will be here. Id say the staff is less than incompetent."}
{"text":"Since i wrote a review about the aweful prime rib and awesome cream of mushroom soup I have gone back a few times and not once did they have the soupe available. I am very disappointed so i just found my own recipe and made it myself. Ya snooze ya loose Coliseum!!"}
{"text":"I won't have given 1 star if the server (Teri or something sounds like that) didn't laugh at me when I asked her, you feed me beef when I ordered chicken. She insisted me, that I order beef when everyone in my table heard I ordered chicken nachos, because I don't eat beef.  We spend almost 3 hours there, and got served drinks only 3 times, you would think, this place must be busy, Trust me, it was not.  Would I go back again? Unless I have to take a leak. Not for drink or food, I can well spend that money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love to come here on Badger Game-day's because the bus is such a great deal!  For a couple of bucks the they drop you off right in front of the stadium and pick you starting at the end of the 3rd Quarter.   Two buses run continuously so there is never much of a wait.  This place could be a real money maker.  Food is good, the pizza looks awesome and the atmosphere is great. This is a large bar with an open attached banquet room.  They also have a outdoor area with tables for when it's nice out or for the smokers.    My problem (on game day) is that they are always understaffed.  The place is always packed, yet they have 3 bartenders.  Three might be a good number if they didn't have to prepare all the drinks for the waitresses.  Getting a drink or paying your food bill at the bar will take forever!     I got seats at the bar, which was great.  They were located right in front of the cash register, next to the register was a little machine that continued to spit out drink orders from the waitresses.  It seemed like the bartenders concentrated on those orders and got to the \"bar\" seats when they could get to them.  They actually looked like they were avoiding eye contact with customers do they could get the waitress orders first.  I'm not knocking the bartenders in any way.  They worked their tails off!  Management however....  Your missing a lot of potential profit.  As I looked around the bar I saw so many patrons standing with money in their hand waiting and wanting to get a drink or a refill, or to pay their food bill.    Hire AT LEAST one more bartender!  Hire someone with a ice cooler to sell caned beer outside or in the back corner.  Otherwise you will continue to get the people who use the bus service to get to the stadium and spend their money at one of those bars.    Management, your welcome!  I'll take a free drink at the next home game!"}
{"text":"Desperate for lunch after my first couple dining options failed to pan out, the Coliseum Bar, with its less than stellar 2.5 star Yelp rating, took advantage of my weakened state to lure me in.  As I entered the parking lot, I was oblivious to the fact that some 75,000 very hungry dairy enthusiasts were converging on the nearby Expo Center for the start of the World Dairy Expo.  I suddenly became aware of that key fact as I stepped into a restaurant in the throes of utter chaos, teaming with the aforementioned hungry dairy enthusiasts.  Instead of having a host manage the near capacity crowd, management felt it wise to have a sign by the entrance informing the throng of patrons to seat themselves.  I found an open table where I sat for almost twenty minutes before desperately flagging down a server to get a menu.  I quickly ordered the first item that caught my eye, a Reuben sandwich and a side of tater tots. Before my server vanished to parts unknown, he indicated it would be a thirty minute wait for my sandwich because the kitchen was backed up.  Oy, that woulda been nice to know twenty minutes ago...  While waiting for a server to appear, I had plenty of time to survey my rather sterile surroundings.  The interior of the Coliseum Bar is your basic no frills Wisconsin sports bar with an armada of flat screens, dark wood paneling, tile floors and generic furnishings.  With all the hard surfaces, the noise level could kindly be described as a dull roar when the restaurant was at near capacity.  After 10 minutes, my food arrived.  It was your classic good news / bad news proposition.  The good news was my food arrived 20 minutes early, the bad news was that my food arrived. (rim shot)  Let's start with the tater tots, which spend too little time in the fryer on their journey from the freezer bag to my plate.  The exterior had not crunch and the interior was mushy, almost like mashed potatoes.    The Reuben sandwich was not better, just an assembly of institutional grade ingredients with little manipulation by the kitchen. The bread, a light rye, with a heavy dose of caraway, spent a minimal time on the grill.  While the cook was generous with the thinly sliced corned beef, it failed to bring an abundance of flavor to the equation. The slightly dry sandwich could have benefited from 1,000 Island dressing which was missing in action.  If you are looking for a volume play, the Coliseum version of this sandwich will fit the bill, but there are many better tasting options available in town for you Reuben aficionados out there.  Excluding the delay in delivering a menu and completely whiffing on the estimate of when my food would be delivered, my harried server did an acceptable job.  As the crush of lunchtime patrons subsided, he even showed some signs of personality.  But all in all, the service this day was only marginally better than the sub-par fare.  If you're looking for prototypical Wisconsin bar and grill fare, the Coliseum Bar will fit that criteria.  However, if you seek elevated pub grub, I'd recommend places like Dexter's, the Tip Top or Baldwin Street Grill before the Coliseum."}
{"text":"This was my second time having lunch here.  It's a nice middle-ground for meeting up with my cousin, so it's our default location until we think of something else.  We got a table right away (plenty to choose from - more on that later) and service was pretty prompt.  No complaints there.  My \"cowboy burger\" was pretty decent.  The burger was prepared as-ordered (medium rare), so I was pleased with that.  The burger was topped with BBQ sauce, bacon, and onion strings.  While I will certainly pay for that later, it tasted very good at the time.  The fries on the side were just okay - had better, had worse.  My cousin got a wrap that looked plenty big and filling.  I'm not much of a wrap guy, but maybe I should try it sometime.  This isn't a place I would highly recommend going, but I wouldn't tell you not to, either.  For me, it's a nice meeting place from people coming from all around.   One good thing (for me, not for them) is that it's not horribly busy over lunch.  While on one hand that could be because people think it sucks.  On the other hand, it's not exactly in the best location to draw people in (outside of events at the Coliseum).  Again - that works well for me.  We can zip in, have a decent lunch, and zip out.    The menu is diverse enough to try several things and not burn out on one item.   I can see myself getting out of the burgers and trying a wrap, the gyros, or even a salad."}
{"text":"This has to be the most BORING bar I have ever seen. The crowd was so homogeneous (basically, fat people and men wearing khakis), it made me physically ill. The food was crap, the music sucked- what a piece of shit the bar is. This place has all the charm of a strip mall. Ugh."}
{"text":"This is the first and only Yelp review ever; it was also my first and only time at The Coliseum. My friends and I stopped by after an event at the Alliant Energy Center to wait for the Uber Surge to drop, and not only was a staff member a total brat frat-bro, I'm pretty sure a staff member stole the contents of my bag.  First of all: the service was terrible. Now, I've worked many service jobs, including fast-food and waitressing and I absolutely always give the staff the benefit of the doubt. It was busy, I understand some confusion, but the waiter was incredibly rude. It took 20 minutes for us to get our drinks, and he returned with 3/8 being correct. Two of them were supposed to be waters and never showed up. We told the waiter that we wanted to close the bill and he came back with one of the missing drinks in a plastic cup for us to take to go (illegal btw). When my friend said he wasn't going to pay for it, the bratty waiter sassed back, \"Ugh you know you're not the only other ones here right?\" and insisted that we pay for it.   After we leave (~15 minutes later), my boyfriend and I realized that we forgot our event bags at the restaurant. My bag contained my prescription lenses and my keys. I immediately called The Coliseum so that it would not be stolen and could be set aside. First, a female staff member answered. When I asked if she could check if they were there she sassed, \"Ummm you know there are like, a million of those bags here right?\" and then the call dropped.   My boyfriend then called back and a different (male) staff member answered. The staff member said that \"he was not going to be responsible for going through the bags, and that we can come back and search through them tomorrow\". Like what? You don't want to be responsible and so you're letting drunken randos go through other people's things? He then hung-up on my boyfriend because \"he couldn't hear us\".   After that I call back (because I need my glasses to see and my keys to get into my apartment). A staff member answers, I re-explain the situation, and then this guy (the same?) says that \"he cannot hear me\" and then magically can hear me perfectly after I insist. I told him, \"I need to know that my keys and prescription lenses are there otherwise I'm going to look for them somewhere else.\" He then goes through a few bags on the phone with me and says, \"I have some keys here.\" Me, \"what do they look like?\". He describes my keys. Hooray! I sincerely thank him and he says that he set the bags aside so that theyll be safe for us to pick-up tomorrow.  *Flash-forward to the next day* The staff (different from the night before) cannot find our bags anywhere, but they found my keys sitting on the counter. Either A) The staff just let some randos go through the bags without even watching them, someone took out my keys, and left with my my glasses and some clothes (btw what kind of trailer-trash middle-school loser steals used clothes?), or B) A staff member stole them (probably the Brat). Either way is irresponsible and the Coliseum is completely liable for that.   When I worked fast-food or serving, if someone forgot something I'd say \"Sure thing! What does it look like?\", they describe whatever it was they lost, then I'd give it to them. Heck, it's the unspoken rule of returning anything lost. If someone were to forget their wallet at The Coliseum, the bartender would probably just hand over the whole stack and say \"I don't want to be responsible\" and some thief would walk off with the thickest leather one.    To be fair, I think the manager was very nice and actually trying to help, so I thank him for that. My only hope is that they try and implement a policy for lost items that actually applies some common sense and kindness."}
{"text":"Plenty of tables, no service though.  Server never once apologized for the wait and rarely checked in, even though glasses were empty--it's a bar, right?  Very hard for our children to wait so long.  Others who came after us got their orders first.  Lots of food options, but quality is a notch below bar fare.  My quesadillas were greasy and sloppy wet.  Almost no vegetables on the menu.  Decor is run down.  When I included a gift certificate in my payment, the server said, \"I'm not sure if this is an event night.  We may not be able to accept this.\"  So, of course, she \"finds out\" it is an event night. If the staff don't even know if it is an event night, how should I know?  Is every night an event night?"}
{"text":"Been to the Coliseum a couple of times now and I like the vibe a lot. In the summer, they host a lot of bar volleyball leagues as they have 2 sand volleyball courts. There are always lots of drink and food specials here. Very large parking lot, so you don't have to worry about finding a parking spot like most downtown bars. The bar is large and usually you can get a drink pretty fast. We had the cheese curds and they were pretty decent. The menu is pretty big and is typical of the sports bar food. Lots of big TVs so a good place to go to watch sports. This place is very close to the Alliant Energy Center, so it is a good bar to hit up before or after an event, which is the usual time I tend to visit."}
{"text":"Some of the staff is pretty awesome, but the Coli is the place to go if you have low expectation and don't want to be impressed. Far and away, the food is mediocre, but I will say the pizza isn't bad and the quesadillas are actually pretty good. Really wish the service was better, could be a great place."}
{"text":"Tater Tots. #1 reason to have lunch at The Coliseum.  The menu has tons of options: burgers, pizza, chicken sandwiches, wraps, the usual bar food.  I was shocked that instead of fries there are many other options, including roasted vegetables and TATER TOTS.  Yes, please.....  My Chicken Phillie Sandwich was o.k., but the Tator Tots rocked. My husband's Buffalo Burger needed more seasoning, but the Tator Tots made up for it.  Maybe they should offer Tater Tot Extravaganza with a variety of dipping sauces.  Yum."}
{"text":"Beer=great Bartender=very good Men's bathroom=putrid abomination  Good:  The Potosi seasonal was excellent and the Friday afternoon crowd was friendly. The bartenders were amiable and attentive.    Bad (really bad): The smell of stale urine and something akin to rotting mice that I encountered in the men's room was horific.  I would never contemplate ordering food or hosting an event at a place with a bathroom as foul as the one at The Coliseum."}
{"text":"I have visited the Coliseum a couple of times and usually stick to the gyro or the burger (with maybe a couple of Korbel old fashioned's thrown in). The food can be above average on some days and below average the others. The gyro today was really dry with limited mayo. Felt like it had been sitting on the spit for waaaaay too long. That said, I do come here because I like the food. So no prizes for guessing the reason for 3 star (average) review.   Drinks are good. Most of the bar tenders do not skimp on the alcohol. Quite a few flavors on tap for beer lovers.   There is usually something happening in the place. In the summer it was a beach volleyball league in their parking lot. A few weeks ago there was a poker tournament. Loads of TV's around if you want to catch a game. An ATM and 4 slot machines sit in one corner."}
{"text":"Great local bar. Cold beer stiff drinks friendly service and good food. Mike and staff will go out of their way to make you happy. Volleyball during the summer adds to the fun."}
