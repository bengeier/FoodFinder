{"text":"Bbq, bacon burger is awesome!  Salads are great for 2. Been coming here since it opened a few years ago for take out and dine in.

Staff has always been friendly and courteous.

3 rating because we love Smash fries but over the years, it's gotten more and more greasy."}
{"text":"Have been to several other \"Best of LV .....\" burger joints and always disappointed. Not here! Fresh, tasty, hot food :) Restaurant is always clean. Personnel is always friendly & professional. I will return and return and return."}
{"text":"This was a very good burger. I ordered the 1/3lb Arizona special with a fried egg. They cook their Angus beef burger at a high heat with a crispy finish, and it tasted great!  Also ordered a side of their herb yam fries which were very good.  They also have Tazo iced tea, which was a nice touch. This location is a bit of a pain, since there is no free parking (it is in a parkade, so you can get some shade by parking in there). The burgers are $5.99 with an extra $1.99 for fries or yam fries."}
{"text":"I love Smash Burger first off, so I came in with high expectations. They did a great job at this new location. Food tasted great as usual, presentation was also good. They were pretty busy but got to us very quickly. Great job all the way around."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love their burgers.Very friendly staff
Their fries are  really great.Had a banana milkshake last night..my only complaint is..it needed more bananas in it..I don't think they use real bananas,only something in a container that looks like a moll container.It was good but for the price,it should have real fruit in it."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Was hesitant at first, but very happy I tried it. Great hospitality, great food. Would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's my favorite, hands down! If you like avocado, try their burger! The fries are exceptional and there is no burger place that offers anything close (rosemary and olive oil)!"}
{"text":"YUM!! I love this place. I have celiac disease so it's hard for me to find places to eat out. Especially fast food restaurants. They have several gluten free options and vegetarian options too. When my husband and I need a quick lunch, this is our go-to choice!"}
{"text":"Smashburger just the way I like it - neat, yummy, correct, and fast, friendly service by employees with good attitudes. I feel taken care of here and always happy with my experience."}
{"text":"We think these are the best burgers going!  Service was good also.  The smash fries are the best.  Burgers are made to order so they're fresh off the grill."}
{"text":"We had a chicken sandwich with no bun and a BBQ, bacon, cheese burger with fries.  The portion size was sufficient.  The atmosphere was casual with a contemporary setting.  There was nothing that was exciting and a little pricey for a burger."}
{"text":"This place is super nice, the store is spotlessly clean with a whiff of 50's diner about it. The service was efficient and fast - the food was up within 5 minutes of placing our order. SUPER NICE WHEN DINING WITH KIDS! 

We all got hamburgers - the meat was perfectly seasoned, the buns were gorgeous and pillowy soft but not overwhelming and huge. The patties were the best size - no mouthfuls of condiment bread, no jaw crackingly huge patties (yuck)  - the cheese was the real deal, with lots of great choices. Veggies included were crisp and fresh and lovely. THE FRIES, oh man, are awesome. Thin cut, none of them floppy, perfectly salted, these are like the fries that McDonalds aspires to. 

I don't usually go for hamburgers but their ad looked so great that we gave it a try, and well, the reason I don't usually like burgers is because everywhere else I've gone makes subpar burgers. We will totally be going back to this chain, specifically this location."}
{"text":"I do love the food.......but the app really sucks. I bought twice in a day and could not get the points for the 2nd purchase. This has happened a couple of times. Then today, app says network issue at the printing location . please submit a picture through the need help button. Well, there is no need help button and this is way too much work. So tired of this terrible app. Will never use again and looking for another burger place now."}
{"text":"Love this place and let me tell you why, not only is it because of the food-- It's the customer service I get at this place!!! It had been a while since I have been in and I mean months, Emily remembered my name and what I order! She IS the  definition of what customer service is. Yes I understand its hard remembering names and what each person orders. But no matter what she always has a smile on her face and talks the same way to each person! She is going to go far in life no matter where or what she ends up doing! Thank you! And thank you Smashburger for making excellent choices when you hire people. 

Now on to the food-
The \"Smash Fries\" have rosemary and olive oil on them... they are a great change from your normal everyday fries.
The Arizona Burger is really tasty, hot jalapenos piled high (I love this), habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, purple onion, chipotle mayo, all on a chipotle bun.

Plus++++ if you join their club they send amazing coupons to you!"}
{"text":"Where do I start the food is always great! This time I had a burger with bacon fresh jalapeño pepper jack cheese ketchup mustard lettuce and onion with a side of fried pickles. The place was packed full of guest but the service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Every time I go into Smash I have a great experience. I'm not sure if they have a small staff or if I always see the same people working but we've built relationships which is crazy with a fast food restaurant! I love the veggie frites (sometimes it's a chocolate milkshake kinda day though) but in all reality the smash sauce is to die for. I see different managers around all the time but have never had anything negative to say, one time they actually brought me a $2 off coupon just for promotion! Ismelda, I hope I spelled that right, always takes my order and is so sweet. Cole usually brings my food, very friendly young man who will have a conversation with you if you let him! I always sit outside, DOG FRIENDLY!!!!! The staff never pets my pup though, which I guess is good for sanitation reasons. Not to mention someone usually comes to clear my table so I have room to relax. Service is really up there with the high star restaurants. If you think this is just another lil burger joint I would definitely check it out, you'd be surprised!"}
{"text":"i admit id idnt know what to expect when my husabdn and i came in here one evening. 

burgers are huge. but greasy! which is ok if thats what ur into. prices are decent and the staff are nice but not super excited to be there. the biggst problem was my sons french fries were cold as ice like the were sitting on the bar for 4 hours before receving them. but it was good other wise. 

i will come back but maybe diff hours when they arent so busy :)"}
{"text":"This burger place is top of the food chain. Amazing food with AMAZING service. Employees are very friendly and I will definitely be coming back again. Best burger in a LONG time."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  I highly recommend this place!  I ordered the spicy jalapeño baja burger with the smash fries.  The fries were awesome!  The hubby had the sin city burger which tasted equally amazing!  We also had the peanut butter milkshake which was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great house made black bean burgers full of flavor. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Solid burgers.     Really like the bread and topping options.   Always served hot.    They do a nice chicken sandwich for health conscious days.     Very good shakes as well.    
The herbal iced tea is a rare find and is a nice blend w a hint of spice"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is.  Probably the worse meal I've had.  Burger was soggy and there was too much sauce.  When the patty slips and slides out of the bun while you try to eat it, there's something wrong.  Fries were stale and oily.  My husband's Avocado club wasn't any better.  Burger itself was bland, the bacon cold, and avocado was not fresh at all.  Definitely not worth the $22 I paid."}
{"text":"The BEST burger I've had in a very long time.  Beats all the other recently popular burger places by far.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Burger was ok for a fast food burger and fries were pretty good.... Problem is the price, for just a couple bucks more you could go to the Palm or Mesa grill and get easily double the beef you get here.  I realize it's casino pricing but you can't just rip me off with better choices 100 feet away."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, get a burger anyway you desire always great.  What keeps me coming back are the sweet potato fries, love the garlic on them."}
{"text":"if you don't love this place exterminate yourself!!! blows all other burger away!!! and i mean in smoke!! the sin city is the best burger i've ever had. oh and smash fries are orgasmic..."}
{"text":"I am a big Smashburger fan, but the last couple times that I have been here I feel that the service and quality of the food have been lacking.  I have ordered the Truffle Mushroom burger my last few times, and it was over-salted and very dry.  When I compare that to the burgers that I have recently gotten from Flipdaddy's which require napkins for how moist they are, I am thinking that more recently Flipdaddy's wins the burger war.  However, the Smash Fries beat the Flipdaddy fries.  Smashburger, please stop disappointing me.  I normally am a big fan."}
{"text":"Solid food, as always. Everyone that works here was outgoing and humorous, making it an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the baja burger. It was good, but I think that this is somewhat overpriced."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want a burger and fries and when I'm in the area I'll stop in here.  Not too expensive and you're attended to fairly quickly. Their fries are thinner here, but they still have flavor. Place is usually clean. The staff is nice. No real complaints. I'll be back :-)"}
{"text":"I love going to this location.  The burgers are always delicious and fresh and the shoestring fries hot and crunchy.  The staff is always friendly and helpful and the manager Jared rocks."}
{"text":"The food at Smash Burger is undeniably good. I gave this particular LOCATION two stars because the service is HORRIBLE. I was so excited when they first opened but service continues to decline.They seem to have a pretty high turn over rate and are always under staffed. Just get my order right and hand it to me with a smile. Pretty simple, right?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the quality of their food, totally undercooked. So dangerous as I am pregnant and have to be carful with bacteria! Not even a grill mark in this burger!!! I ordered a bun less avocado club and the party was still bloody inside. Had to post the picture, hopefully they see it and take better control of their quality in food."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about two times since I love burgers. So first off this place is really small but clean (then again it's a fairly new place). The staff was friendly but the cleaning the tables part was very poor. It took a while for them to bus the tables when people wanted to sit down. 

Now getting down to the burgers, so far I tried the mushroom Swiss burger with extra mushrooms because I love mushrooms. It was really good but very greasy. I also ordered the smashfries as a side, ehh it was okay it's topped with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic salt. But man was there way to much olive oil! The other burger I tried was the Sin City SmashBurger which has bacon, fried egg, cheese, onions (I don't like raw onions so I took that out), haystack onions, and egg bun. It was good but oily! 

The prices of the burgers range from $4.99 to $6.99 and the sides range from $1.49 and $3 something."}
{"text":"SmashBurger's burgers are delicious, but their Veggie burger is not the greatest. I love me my meat but I was craving for a veggie burger. So I decided to get the mushroom swiss with a veggie burger. SmashBurger needs to work on their veggie burger because while I was eating it, it was falling apart and it was to soft. I noticed that the veggie burger had black beans pressed with some veggies (I hope). 

You have to try their chocolate malt shake because it does have some chunks or chocolate malt which makes it so delicious. Their Smash fries are one of the best fries I have ever tried. I also recommend trying their Sin City Burger (if you like egg with your burger)."}
{"text":"Smash burger is my favourite burger . But this place is dirty. Outdoors and indoors tables were diryy. They dobt ckean the bsthrooms as well . I think they beed a new manager or staff. Even the staff tgey dont great you when u come in."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon cheese burger. The meat was dry . The bacon was half burned. The worst burger ive tried.
Kids burger and crispy chicken were ok.
+ we had to clean the table before sitting ."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes and NO burger. Watched several customers who came in after me eat their lunch and leave. Finally got a refund and left. Was really looking forward to trying this place but absolutely NEVER again! Had a meeting to go to and couldn't eat until dinnertime. Disgusted. Not even worth the one star review!!!!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! I have been in the US for 7 years now, never have i ever had such a juicy ,delicious burgers. I have now figured why Americans love their burger so very much.

Personally the Mushroom burger was the best followed by the Arizona burger.
The serving size is generous.Their choices on the beverages is also very wide.
Smash fries are unique!!!

I am looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Our company just moved into the area and I've been looking for a good burger restaurant for lunch. This place just isn't it. The quality of the meat isn't there, and I thought I had ordered their standard burger, but apparently that doesn't come with lettuce (which, to be fair, isn't their fault, it's corporate's fault). For the latter part, I blame myself for not doing more research prior to going, but I also don't feel like I should have to."}
{"text":"I personally prefer this over in n out, the smash fries are to die for! I love the October breast cancer awareness shake it's a raspberry sorbet milkshake which should be put on the menu because it's banging. I think their Oreo milkshake is runner up to the raspberry. Their burgers are filling especially if you get them \"big\" it's light but liking, if that makes sense. I feel that in n out burgers are packed with stuff and can be overwhelming at times. I definitely will stop at a SmashBurger if they are around me."}
{"text":"Downgraded to four stars, because they messed with my favorite burger and turned the mushroom swiss into a truffle burger of some kind.  If you like the more pungent, earthly taste of truffles, then maybe this burger is for you.  I do not.  So, while I still like the other menu choices, the old mushroom swiss flavor was my favorite...not any more."}
{"text":"Good food but I wouldn't say great.  Everything was good really nothing bad to say besides it is pricey for what you get.  I would much rather go to Red Robin and spend the same amount of money.  Lastly the chocolate malt is great"}
{"text":"I am not impressed. I got the mushroom burger and I guess I should have assumed the \"smash\" part meant that they would squish the patty ... But that takes most of the flavor out! O I was excited for fried pickles but they were really greasy and gross! 

Also it was damn cold in there...
I'll stick with 5 guys"}
{"text":"I had the spinach and goat cheese chicken sandwich. Let me begin with the chicken was perfectly cooked - nice and juicy. The chicken was on a whole grain bun with spinach, goat cheese, cucumber, tomato and balsamic dressing. I was baffled by the inclusion of cucumber on the sandwich, so I took them off and ate them as a side item. The balsamic was a squirt in the middle of the bun, it would have better if  the spinach and tomato were tossed in the balsamic verses squirted on the bun where it soaked in. There was a generous portion of goat cheese. I also had a side of the sweet potato fries with evoo, garlic and rosemary. Again as with the balsamic the evoo, garlic and rosemary was a dollop that landed on a just few fries - the fries were not completely coated with the \"special house seasoning\"."}
{"text":"The burger was pretty dang delicious (i had the chipotle jalapeno burger). The atmosphere was ok. The decor was nice and the service was nice too. It was a little expensive for burgers but...ya canta argue with taste. Tasty food, pretty good dining experience. Definately recommend it."}
{"text":"Well...Smashburger had officially taken the typical downward spiral after a great start. The food is starting to go downhill, but more importantly the customer service has hit a low. They completely botched our order today. My husband went back in, and the manager didn't even have the decency to come out and speak with him. He was yelling at my husband from the kitchen. How backward and embarrassing. The whole restaurant got quiet. He was yelling out that my husband had ordered incorrectly.  When he did eventually come out to look at the order on the computer, he realized that indeed the restaurant had made the mistake.  After getting the correct order, my husband left. Then, on the way home he realized they had not given him the drinks for both kids meals.  So, he had to go back again for a third time. Yikes!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It a great place to go if you want a good burger. The only thing that I have a problem with is the wait. I ordered just fries once and it took them 15 mins to bring it out."}
{"text":"I really like the Smash Burger as a whole, but this location struggled with a couple of things.

Pros: The food came out quickly and it was good. This is a good location if you live in North East Gilbert.

Cons: They got our order wrong (missing condiments and sides). The drink station was a mess and not stocked. The trash was overflowing even though the restaurant wss not particularly busy. They don't participate in the loyalty program that other locations do."}
{"text":"After having a horrendous experience at a different restaurant yesterday, I *had* to go to Smash Burger today to restore my faith in restaurants. Thank you SB for the awesome service and amazing food, as usual."}
{"text":"Great yummy burgers and good service, comfortable to eat in or good to take out!  Only hesitation....the cleaning supplies and equipment are stored IN the restaurant immediately adjacent to the pick-up counter for servers....eeeewwwwww....please move that stuff!!"}
{"text":"Food here is always amazing. I've never had a bad experience here which is awesome and for how much the food is. It's delicious! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone how wants a quality burger instead of going to a chain fast food joint."}
{"text":"Food is OK at this locale. Management is awful. Cleanliness just as bad. I have been here a few times, and it looks like a high school cafeteria."}
{"text":"A great place to get an $8 1/3 pound burger and fries.  This is a fast food burger place for people that a willing to pay a little more for quality.

I got the BBQ, Bacon, Onion String, & Cheddar Burger with SmashFries.  The egg bun (that's the only kind I buy for home) is grilled and quite tasty.  Burger was delicious, though the bacon wasn't quite cooked enough and was difficult to gnaw through.  The fries were quite good, but left me wanting some sort of aioli to dip them in.

Properly cooked bacon & a custom fry sauce would merit 5 stars but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their burgers and chicken sandwiches were good but nothing great. Their smash fries weren't very good. Very salty and very thin and short making eating them difficult. But my biggest problem is the rude staff! Cashiers who ignore you when you're asking them a question. And not just ignore you but have a conversation with the cashier next to them while you're mid-question. Also, the girls telling you they're coming right back to wipe down your dirty table and never coming back. It wasn't even busy lunch rush hour yet every table was dirty. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Smashburger! 

The menu is easy to understand and has a decent amount of variety for something with \"burger\" in the title. The people who take my order are always knowledgable about the food and are very friendly when answering my questions. 

I love the burgers, they are so juicy and tender and never taste charred at all! The toppings are always fresh and they do not skimp on them at all! Their chili cheese dog is amazing too! 

Besides having great food, I'd have to say that the staff at this location is always super friendly! We've been there a few times and we always manage to strike up a conversation with someone that works there, and they all seem to be genuinely happy to be at work, they're smiling and friendly. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a good burger at a good price!"}
{"text":"The people there are fantastic! They are always super helpful and really friendly. The burgers are as good as the people that work there too! The burgers are always fresh and juicy and the fries are crisp and toasty. However, the shakes are nasty and probably shouldn't be consumed ever. Other than that, fantastic restaurant and I love going there."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place thrilled me, but I suppose I'd go back again.  Well, I have to since I bought myself a gift card when they were on sale!

I found their branding a bit overpowering... Smashburger, Smashchicken, Smashsoda... ok, I get it.  But like the other reviews say, a burger's a burger, and Smash didn't seem to take the concept any further.  

I got the Smashchicken Club (or smash-something like that).  It wasn't at all bad, but then what's bad when it's got chicken and avocado on it?  Smashavacado.

Smash.  I'll go back, but not tomorrow.  Smash."}
{"text":"Ordered the try 2 combo, good price has the cuban grill & yucatan chicken tortilla soup."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, line moved quickly, but this is how much guacamole comes on the Arizona burger they have advertised all over their walls. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The saltiest burger I've ever had. Couldn't even finish it, it was so salty. And I am definitely not sensitive to salt."}
{"text":"The VERY BEST in Vegas! The employees, Anisha, Rich, Sid and the others all make you feel right at home and customer satisfaction is their top priority! Have been to other Smashburgers but none compare to this one and thats because of the GREAT crew they have working there. They have it running like a swiss watch! Smooth and efficient! Highly recommend eating here. They always greet you with a smile and alway check to make sure everything is good! Cant say enough good things about the employees and the food!! Love it there!! See ya soon!! :)"}
{"text":"Truffle mushroom Swiss burger is the best! 
Do yourself a favor and order the haystack onions with it. 
Love all of their shakes. The peanut butter and jelly shake tastes exactly like a sandwich but way way better. Favorite burger spot."}
{"text":"Smashburger is delicious, the only issue I find with this place is their portions are getting smaller. You pay over a dollar for haystack fries to be added to a burger, I would expect enough to be added that I don't have to go looking for them. Same with the portion of fries they give you. But otherwise delicious. Most of the workers are very professional, you have the occasional female employee would would rather flirt than work, but you can't win them all."}
{"text":"Burgers: YES!    Shakes: NO!

It was a Friday at lunch time. Dining room is not super big so be prepared to get your food to go or battle for a seat. 

I had the black bean burger and the smash fries. Amazing! The burger was packed with flavor for a vegetarian option. The fries are seasoned with garlic, olive oil and rosemary. Deeee-licious.  Priced better than Five Guys.

My buddy and I decided to take shakes to go back to work with us. They ended up being the equivalent of a runny, melted DQ Blizzard. Not thick, not delicious, definitely not worth $4. 

I might go back for the burgers, but steer clear of the shakes. I felt like they skimped on the ice cream and flooded the cup with milk to save time or money and left annoyed."}
{"text":"I finally went today to see for myself. I arrived just before lunch 11:45. I ordered a regular smash burger with a side if fries! Total bill $7.90 I got water instead if a soda. The food was hot and GOOD. The server was nice and came back several times to see if I needed anything. I gave her a dollar for her service.
The only comment is that they have too many servers! The Manager needs to address this issue.
Other than that I was completely satisfied.
Will come back again
Jay"}
{"text":"I really like this place for \"fast\" food without feeling like you are at a McDonalds. You order your food at the counter and pay there and they bring it to you at the table, but will come to your table again to see if they can get you anything else.

I have been here many times now for dinner when I just wanted a quick, fairly inexpensive meal, and it is consistent and reliable. I have only had chicken sandwiches but each one has been great. I'm also told the burgers are good. I love the sweet potato fries. The milkshakes are also fantastic. They sell beer which is a nice plus over typical fast food places."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of vegan food but the other day I decided to try the black bean burger and the carrots with green beans instead of fries.  The Burger had good flavor and kind of tasted like a bean burrito. But the carrots and green beans we're yummy.  I wanted to use a more educated word but yummy is what comes to mind with every bite.  It says they're slightly fried so not sure how healthy they are.  Maybe that's why they are so tasty.  I gave this particular Smashburger 3 stars because of the cashier.  She was cussing up a storm in front of customers because her Co workers we're picking on her.  Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"SMASH BURGER is a great place for lunch.
Nick is very hospitable and made lunch perfect !!!

Double Malt Salted-Caramel Malt !!!
Mmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Good service, but prices suck. It is expensive, around $12 for a burger, fries, and drink. You will also be waiting a while. They need to lower their prices and improve their waiting time."}
{"text":"Um one word YUM!! This place is so good! The chicken sandwiches are so yummy my tummy is grumbling thinking about it!

The cashiers were really friendly and helpful with any questions I had. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now with good experiences. The burgers are tasty and they give you a good amount of fillings, which make the bun itself a little too small to contain everything. That being said, it can get a bit messy while eating. I believe they use angus beef, which adds to the flavour. The milkshakes are hand spun with Haagen-Daz ice cream and they give you a generous amount. Their fries are definitely different - my first thought was \"these are the world's skinniest fries\" as they are about 1/4 of the size of normal fries and shorter. Again, you get a generous amount with an order. Definitely going to try their onion rings next time.

The staff are very friendly and will come by to check on you to make sure everything is good and that you have everything you need. You also get coupons and free offers every visit which is never a bad thing. Overall, a great burger place with great food!"}
{"text":"I love Smashburger and make a point of going there any time I'm in Phoenix. The beef is fresh, never frozen, and absolutely delicious. The buns make the burger. They are not the typical dry bun you usually get; they squish up with the burger when you take a bite. The sauce is perfect. I'd recommend the classic smash the first time you go and then make changes next time if you want. You've got to try it the way they make it. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for my first Smash Burger experience. Over the noon hour is was quite busy but we had our food within about 10 minutes. This lunch hour wait is on par with In N Out next door. 

I had the BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger. It was pretty good but the application of BBQ Sauce was thin at best. For an extra topping I ordered jalapenos and they came out raw, I was expecting the pickled variety. I probably wouldn't have those again. I also ordered pickles as a topping and these were quite good, thick slices similar to a Clausen, not your typical hamburger pickle chips. 

For sides we had the regular fries and fried pickles. The fries weren't bad, sort of reminded me of McDonald's, although I would have liked a few more. The fried pickles were not too good, pickles were sort of mushy (star deduction) For now I will stick to ordering my fried pickles at Memphis BBQ or Lucile's. 

Second star deduction is the price. Don't get me wrong, the burger was good, but so is In N Out and for less than the price of one burger at Smash, I can get a whole meal at In N Out. I'll be back, but not often."}
{"text":"The Good: 
Really good burger.
Good fries.
The Bad:
Terrible paint and lighting. Can't even hang out for long. (Maybe that is the idea.) Don't like high booth stalls much.
JMHO of course.
Also a note to the sewage smell that others noted. That little area on that side of the mall has smelled like hell for years for some odd reason. It sucks for the businesses, but I assure you it has nothing to do with Smashburger alone nor should it cause any health concerns. Just luck of the draw on a bad sewer vent problem.

Update: 4/18/10
Went again. Really very good. Decor is still not my fav but the food is solid. Like I said, it is the juiciest burger I have had in a while. Shoestring fries are kill. Upped from 3 stars to four."}
{"text":"Make sure you check your pick up order! I waiting in line with no cashier forever for them to mess up my order beyond belief.  They got 1 of my 4 items correct, I don't know how you get it that wrong."}
{"text":"One of those places that just makes a few things and they made them well. Great burgers, great salads and great sides."}
{"text":"Went in to eat and employees were in the back, never came to the front to check we left after about 6 minutes of waitin, love smashburger but the employees in this location were not really into it"}
{"text":"Great food. Don't go at meal time or you'll have a wait. (For good reason) NOT diet food! Greasy juicy burger  I love their sweet potato fries. Wife loves the smash burger fries, Basel & olive oil. Have to admit it, they are really good too. The Arizona burger with extra jalapeños is magnificent."}
{"text":"Fair to say Smash burger is the one of the best places if you're craving for a good juicy burger. But their smash fries is my favourite!!! Great ambience, you can find all kinds of seats whether you're dining alone, with family and kids, or with a group of pals; same as yesterday, could use some music though. Brilliant service, very nice people.

Once again Yelp has recommended a wonderful restaurant to complete my night. You just make my settling down in Calgary much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"So bad... Just so very bad. Tonight was our first time at a smash burger and it will certainly be out last. We waited in line for 20 minutes, then waited another 15 minutes for a salad and one burger with fries. My fiancé's burger was very greasy and the fries were cold. My salad was not much better. It was supposed to have raisins, cheese, seeds, etc. it had maybe 4 raisins and a few seeds but all of the toppings were on the bottom of the salad. The bowl is also oddly shaped leaving it difficult to stir the salad dressing which had just been poured on top. They also only had plastic silverware. We got out of there for less then $20, which isn't bad. But we would have rather had in and out all day long over whatever they are trying to pass off as food from this place."}
{"text":"How is this place still open? The worst Smashburger we've been to. Ordered the Black Bean burger. Waited 31minutes for it. Took a bite... so gross. No flavor and it had the consistency of baby poop. Threw it in the trash and walked down to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Having passed by this place a few times by work I wasn't expecting much, but I was surprised. Its a basic contemporary fast food joint. Ala Fat burger with a little yuppie mixed together. For fast food I thought it was pretty good portion and was very satisfied with my Smash Burger and Smash Fries. I left very full and happy that I went there instead of the usual more greasy fast food joint. I would recommend to friends and coworkers who were in the mood for a quick and fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"Overall not a bad place. I had the Carolina burger with fried pickles. As a pickle lover I try fried pickles whenever I see them on a menu. These pickles were greasy, limp and a tiny portion (try about 15 pickles).  Very disappointing! The customer service and the Carolina burger were well worth it.  I guess i will just stick to the burgers next time."}
{"text":"Good chicken and beef burgers. Love the BBQ burger with a chicken patty.

Great tasting sides, too: fried green beans and carrots, and the herb-dressed smash fries (note that they can be deceptively filling and a bit oily). And, they sell unsweetened iced tea, which is unfortunately a rarity in Calgary.

I like that they have some Calgary-specific items on the menu."}
{"text":"First the service was perfect . Down hill from there. The cost for three of us was 34.00 really? Then you \" smashed \" my burger to death. I just can't get past the oh my god price tag! Ill never go back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's very busy, though, and you can expect a wait: especially if you go on a Friday or Saturday.  Good luck finding parking!  The staff are friendly and courteous, the restaurant is clean, and the food is superb.  May I recommend the avocado bacon burger with bleu cheese and a side of haystack onions?  The buns are soft and fresh and the meat is flavorful.  I'm not a huge fan of the fries - they are the skinny kind and I prefer something thick, but when you can have haystack onions instead for 30 cents more, who cares?"}
{"text":"Very disappointing - called from the plan at 8:30 to place an order but was told that they've\"just shut down\" even though they close at 9.  Disappointed in the lack of customer service"}
{"text":"Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they don't.  Usually only have one teenager running the register, and running food.  Don't recommend for lunch time, you'll never get back to work on time.  Several people left the line and went elsewhere. We left line and went to Pachino's restaurant,  a sit down and order place, and still got our food faster for about the same $."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this over Culvers.  The bun was very good, meat patty was good but I like Culvers butter basted patty better.  Fries were good with the garlic seasoning. The fact that they serve Coke Zero was also a plus for me."}
{"text":"I've had many people as for the 'expert's' opinion on Smashburger expecting some overly positive response, and I think every time I answer them they leave disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent burger, but I have my reasons.
For the uneducated, Smashburger is becoming a decent sized chain of 'cheap', trendy burger places so I almost hate to review it, but here it is anyway. They are typically found in strip malls, somehow always located directly across the street from an In-N-Out at every location in Vegas. The décor is nothing to write home about, a big flashy red logo and accompanying signage at the back wall, cheap seating, and minimal treatment to the ceilings and rest of the space. Ambiance is not why you will come here, what will bring you here is the vague recommendations you remember hearing from friends or the intimidating drive thru line across the street at the In-N-Out you were about to go to.
The menu is better than most places I've reviewed lately strictly for the reason that they actually offer many pre-designed burgers to choose from, unlike all the do-it-yourself places that have been popping up all over town. Plus, I believe they have a somewhat localized item on each menu, as they have the Sin City Burger here which I am sure is not offered in their Georgia locations.
The burger itself is decent, the meat isn't too flavorful but I don't expect much coming from a somewhat fast food location. The bun is good, and proportioned quite well to the amount of meat you get. I've ordered the mushroom and swiss burger a couple of times, and have been happy with the fact that the cheese is typically melted, and the mushrooms are cooked well. It even comes out mostly medium-rare as ordered. The toppings on a couple of the other burgers I've tried have also been proportioned well, with good flavor. The fries are tolerable, but become much more flavorful as Smashfries, which are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. They might get a bit too oily, but are quite tasty.
This all sounds good right? Well it is, but what gets me in the end is that it's just a bit too expensive for what it is. I don't think I've walked away from the register without it costing me less than $14 for a meal here, which I think is a bit too steep for a fast food burger meal. This is where In-N-Out wins me over every time, although lots of people argue that the flavor is better here. I'm somewhat on the fence with that, but if I have the choice of spending $6 for a double-double meal, or $14 on a Smashburger meal, it's a no-brainer for me even with the long line. Still, a lot of people speak quite highly of this burger, and it is a good meal no matter what you get, so if you're willing to spend a little bit extra then by all means indulge yourself."}
{"text":"Yes, I like Smashburger.

It is not the best hamburger I've ever had.
It is not the fastest hamburger place you'll go to.
It is not trendy and fancy.

What it is, is a great sort of fast-casual (read: slower than McDonalds, faster than a sit-down restaurant) restaurant.  

The burgers are high quality for a casual dining restaurant.  They have a few different varieties of burgers, all coming in either 1/3lb or 1/2lb versions.  You can also build your own using any combination of their available toppings.  

Highlight of the entire meal for me :  Adding a fried egg on top of my burger.  My wife makes fun of me for it, but toss a fried egg on a burger, and I'm in heaven.  This place tosses a perfectly fried egg ontop of a delicious burger...fantastic.

The fries are quite tasty as well.  Our super-friendly cashier informed us that the fries are actually McDonalds' old french fry recipe, before they switched to canola oil, etc.  She says Smashburger bought the recipe/etc and now use it as their own.  Who knows if that's true, but it sure did taste true.  Delicious, crispy, salty...amazing.  Just like McD's used to make - you know, before they took out the trans fats, etc.  Maybe they aren't health food...but as a time-to-time indulgence, not so terrible.  They offer regular varieties with sea salt, or they have \"SmashFries\" with olive oil, rosemary, etc.  They also have Sweet Potato fries...  Hard to choose just one, as they are each great for their own reasons.  Honestly, I think the regular salted fries are my favorite, but not by much.

We tried the Smashchicken crispy too - not bad!  Hard to order chicken at a place that does such good burgers, but it was quite tasty.  Not the highest quality cut of bird, but it was white meat and tender and pretty darn good.  

Finally...the milkshakes.  Nothing earth-shattering, but definitely quality.  The chocolate was smooth without being overpowering.  They also have a \"cactus vanilla\" which is a blend of vanilla and prickly pear.  I loved it.  Subtle prickly pear flavor with a good strong vanilla.  I really enjoyed it.

The prices aren't fast food low.  Between 2 of us, we were easily over $20...but we didn't exactly skimp on anything either.  2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 milkshakes.  

We'll definitely return, and I suggest you give it a shot as well."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Smashburger today for the first time after a meeting, but I have to say...I've experienced better.  

The menu is decent with enough variety to choose from to keep people coming back (you can choose to have a 1/3 lb, 1/2 lb, or chicken burger for a kind of 'burger'), but there are better burger places to make this place someplace I'd want to keep returning.

First off, there are no combo meals.  You have to get everything a la carte, but if you buy a side with a burger, you get $1 off the side.  Still, I got a 1/3 lb mushroom burger with veggie frites, and I paid about $10.  No drink included.  At a place that is technically fast-food.  And THAT was supposed to be a deal.

Second, the veggie frites were kind of soggy.  There was no crispity crunchy outing that I would have expected from fried veggies.  And they were a bit salty.  And Smashburger was kind of stingy about how much they gave me.  The dip they gave me for the frites were good, though.  I dipped the burger in it, too.

I mean, the employees are friendly, the food is made to order so it's fresh, you have the freedom to basically make your own burger, and the egg bread that my burger came on was really good, which is all great, but for a college kid who's got to be financially responsible, better overall value can be found someplace else."}
{"text":"Got take out and they got my order wrong and the burgers are small. They tasted aight tho"}
{"text":"Thought I'd check out the hype.  Great burger, had the \"Big Smash\" which hangs out the side of the bun a bit.  Very, very juicy.  Great flavor.  The rosemary \"Smash Fries\" are very good as well.  Onion bun was good.  It's not so much greasy as it is juicy, but I could see how it can get messy.

The owners were having a little conference at the table next to us and treated us to try samples of the black-bean burger.  While the patty itself is vegetarian, it's cooked on the same flat-top as the meat burgers, so they are trying to figure out how to declare that on the menu board.  The burger was very good, great black bean flavor and actually held up pretty well on the bun.

Service was excellent and pretty quick.  We'll definitely add this to our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Well, I am by no means a burger connoisseur, the food here is pretty good.The food here is the licious affordable and the service is great. The classic is amazing. However I don't recommend the fried pickles. The shakes are mediocre, they just taste like ice cream. However I especially liked the smash fries and a root beer is to die for, especially if you get the IFB version. And amazing place for food. This is perfect for a casual night out for dinner with the family on a Friday night. If your"}
{"text":"The slowest service ever, place was almost empty, but it took at least 20 mins before I ordered. Then I had to wait another 20-30 mins for my order. They brought me food that I did not order.  So, had to wait another 10 minutes to get a right sandwich. I ended up taking my order to go. Chicken was hard and dry. I will never go to this place again, worst service ever!"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 meals and they screwed up all but one. Two Buffalo chicken Sandwiches - no blue cheese on either and  one had no buffalo sauce. They missed one fry. Didn't put avocado on the avocado burger ( isn't that the point?) AND it was cold and out office is a short drive from the location. They did manage to do the AZ Cobb salad right but that was about it. I bet Burger King would've been better!!! Called and PEDRO the manager said he will give us the same order and supervise - stay tuned"}
{"text":"I came by this location tonight for a side of my favorite fried pickles. I went to walk in ten minutes before closing, which I felt bad about but wasn't prepared for the locked door that greeted me. I won't be back to this location due to them not being able to keep their doors open till the time they promise online and on the door. Very disappointed considering I'm a loyal customer...."}
{"text":"Best kids' meals anywhere. Got hungry kids that actually like to eat a meal when they order a kids' meal and not just play with a toy? Then this is your place. Food is healthy and portions are generous. Best part of this location is the splash pad right across from the patio so the kids can run around and play in the water too. In the winter there is a big outdoor fireplace that feels nice too. Service is superb and food is authentic (tastes real, not overly processed) and healthy. Our whole family loves it!"}
{"text":"Favorite spot for high quality food during the lunch rush. These guys treat customers like family and take care of all the details to make sure your food is perfect and you enjoy your meal. I'm very impressed with the new management. This is good food, fast, that is a huge leap above \"fast food\"... Love it!"}
{"text":"We arrived after 6pm, during dinner rush hour to a small, fast-moving line. While the menu seemed limited to about half a dozen burger choices and handful of other meat/non-meat options, the product finished with surprising flair.  I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger (minus cheese in my case) and rosemary-garlic sweet potato fries.  

Let me say, THIS burger had that char-grilled black crunchiness you think of when biting into a perfect backyard burger in the mid-summer, with all the flavors of top-grade, savoury flavoured Angus beef.  Juices and oils dripped like rain off this sandwich.  For a fast-food joint, I never expected a simple order of sweet potato fries to have so much punch, either!  Ketchup was hardly needed, though I may have recommended a nice aoli dip to go with them.  

Staff were mostly young teens, though surprisingly cheerful.  The cashier girl even made it a point to come to our table to ask how we liked the meal and if this was our first visit in.  As we leaved, every available associate either thanked us for coming in or wished a good evening.  

If you have the zeal of a deprived, starving carnivore, make this a definite destination.  It's a rich, meaty hamburger that doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, server helped me create my own burger and manager not only assisted his staff be helping deliver food was courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Got a burger, fries, drink and a shake for $15. Food is just not good, and portion size does not add up to the price. Places like five guys are far better and will keep my business going forward."}
{"text":"the hamburgers are very delish when I started going a year ago but now the meat patty seems to be getting smaller/thinner. the quality is not there anymore, its not just this location, ive been to others around phx. I haven't been back ."}
{"text":"The place was super busy maybe that is why our food was really cold. Seemed like chicken was cold but the cheese was warm. Fries were completely cold. I would have loved to wait a little more for a better, warmer meal."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. The employees seem to actually like working there, and are really friendly! Great seating and always tasty burgers. Check out the Butterfinger milkshake for sure, even if you don't like the chocolate bar, the milkshake is deadly delicious."}
{"text":"The burgers are always greasy here and the staff is rude. They also kicked us out 10 minutes before close."}
{"text":"The burgers were AMAZING!  Everything about them was great.  The meat, buns, and toppings were what you want in a burger.  The burger was cooked perfectly and was so juicy.  The service was really good.  I was impressed.  The only thing I would change are the fries.  I didn't think they matched up in excellence to the burger. (that's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars)  Other than that....YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Super nice find away from the hustle and bustle of the LV Strip. They make those burgers fast!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are OK as well as their smash fries. Servings are very small and overpriced. Great customer service and orders are served pretty quick. Don't know if I'd go back."}
{"text":"Let's start with the staff on my trip today. They were all standing around talking either to one another or messing with their cell phones. Being inattentive is rude at a restaurant and people are waiting on their orders and were definitely doing so. 
Next when a person orders a burger without cheese and the staff messes up and puts cheese on your burger it is customary to replace the burger. It is not the customers fault you are not paying attention. Instead they scraped the cheese off my burger and brought it back to me. How did I know this? The burger not only tastes like cheese still (because when it melts the flavor is in the meat), the burger still had cheese flecks all over it. Thanks for your great service (insert sarcasm here)
Next up I decided to trust this crew to make me a malted milkshake...Mistake. When one prepares a shake with malt one doesn't just make the shake and throw some malt into the bottom in large clumps. It should be made into the shake while blending.
I am convinced the staff here on 8/28 6pm does not value their jobs, value their customers and does not have any concern for quality. This is not only unfortunate but you have lost my business and will lose the business of my family, friends and coworkers. I am a marketing professional and do know how to circulate bad reviews quite well. 
It's very sad that people choose jobs they do not value and this team should work in a different industry...perhaps telemarketing and not food."}
{"text":"The burger was good.  My 6 year old declared the best burger ever and wanted a second one. The fries were shoe string style. They were crispy and the Smash Fries were tasty. The milkshakes were a bit over priced for what they are, but the service was amazing.  Everyone was pleasant and customer focused. I would recommend it to other for sure!"}
{"text":"I only come here for one item... and one item only.  It's definitely not what people would expect to come here for, but this dish is delish!!  Ready...........it's their Goat cheese and spinach salad!!!!  Yummmmm!!!!  Always with extra goat cheese and grilled chicken. I never expected to fall in love with a salad at a \"Burger joint \" like..ever. I cannot review anything else but this classic beauty, it is all I truly want in a world full of beefy burgers.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Had my first Smashburger experience at this location. Staff was super helpful in guiding me through the menu and options. The guy was patient and considerate. However, in my opinion, it is a tad expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"This week was our first visit in. It was actually really good. Real meat patties unlike Freddys thin patties. We heard of it by word of mouth from a few co-workers. Our boss decided to go in and try it with his wife. Came in the next day so happy to have a burger that was actually hot that he bit his lip in shock :) He liked it so much he bought us lunch. We ALL loved it! And in a place with VERY picky men that can be hard someone is always not happy... not this time. We liked it so much we have had it twice this week (4 times for my boss). I know this will become a regular visit for us. We dont do drink and for 6 of us to eat it was only about $50 with tax.... so i dont think its very pricey.

O and the sweet potato fries... not my thing and i love them normally. :("}
{"text":"Went to Smashburger for the first time with a friend on Mon. 6/28 -- service was fine, the restaurant was clean, but the food was disappointing.

Ordered a burger and haystack onion rings -- the food came out to the table from the kitchen in under 2 minutes from being ordered.  There is no way food can be cooked that fast unless prepared/cooked in advance.  I ordered lettuce on the side -- they gave me one meager piece of lettuce...

Burger tasted OK, not great.  Was not hot as if it had been prepared in advance and was just warmed up.  Haystack onion rings was a very small portion and did not taste fresh.  My friend had the same issue with his burger and his french fries were soggy and not hot -- as if they had been prepared way in advance and just warmed up.

Unfortunately the quality of the food was not up to par and I will not be returning to Smashburger.  I would also note that we went to this location at lunch time (around 12pm) and it was deserted -- not a good sign.

I would have given this restaurant 1 star due to food quality, but the service was good and the employees were friendly.

{"text":"I was very happy with my experience at Smash Burger. I ordered 4 burgers to go and each one had something added or omitted and all were made correctly.

The staff was very friendly and helpful and gave me the 10% off Yelp discount even though I was having trouble with the app and could not pull up the actual coupon.

The wait to get our food was fairly short but still the manager gave my daughter some Oreo cookie to eat and chatted with us about babies and such. 

I felt that the prices were very reasonable, my order of 2 Sin City burgers, one club burger, one plain burger, 2 Smash fries, 1 veggie fries, and 1 PB&J shake came to under $35 dollars. 

I would definitely go back to Smash Burger and recommend them to my friends. The staff were friendly and the food was great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Quality and service are on point every time. Burgers are good and sweet potato fries are some of the best around. Good little hamburger place but they serve beer, by the bucket, so that gets them the 5th star."}
{"text":"We really want to like this place, but it suffers from inconsistency.

The first time we came here, our orders came out within 10-15 minutes. The burgers were terrific: juicy and delicious. Their smashfries (tossed with olive oil, rosemary, and garlic) and sweet potato fries were very good.

During our second visit, the difference was night and day. It took over 30 minutes from when we ordered to get our food. My burger was extremely well done to the point of being dry and charred. My wife's smashcobb salad was very small for the price and unappetizing as well. Veggie frites were a complete miss and consisted of oily veggies with no crispy coating. The only decent thing about that meal was the regular fries. Were we even dining at the same restaurant?

The third time I came for a CMYE. My order was ready within 15 minutes. I tried one of their new BBQ Ranch chicken sandwiches which was very tasty. However, this time the smashfries were soggy from too much olive oil. I also tried a strawberry shake which was not bad.

When this places fires on all cylinders, it merits a solid 4 stars. When things fall flat, it only barely deserves 2 stars. Until it addresses its lack of consistency, I'm assigning it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I went with their recommendation of burger and fries and was no too impressed with the olive oil and herb fries: super oily (seriously dripping with oil) and may not have been freshly fried (which is what I would expect from a joint like this)

I can tell that their burger meat is superior, yet I was not in love with their recommended toppings.

This review could turn into a 5 star if I find the right combo of toppings.

If a restaurant makes recommendations it should be their best, most mind blowing items.

I'm going to give them another try and see what works for me because the topping selection is HUGE and FRESH."}
{"text":"Easily the best fast food burger I have ever had. Soooo good. I need one where I live. But the lady who was helping us was kind of rude and the milkshake was very watery. Just stick to getting the burger and fries and not the milkshakes. Unless you like them watery. All in all I went there for a burger and it was the best!"}
{"text":"Like Ice Cube said \"today was a good day\"! This was my first time coming here and the workers were friendly and very helpful. The food was great and the service was excellent. So, when I first walked through the door I was met with a smile by my cashier who kindly explained the menu to me. They told me what was an hot item to order, so I did. Now, when my food arrived it was amazing, hot and fresh. After I took my first I knew I had made the right choice when I stopped here. Lastly, once again with my head held high I will be back here again!"}
{"text":"Five star burger cooked perfectly medium. Daniel, our chef, knocked it out of the park with seasoning that was genius in it's perfection.

Chris Hodges was the manager on duty, was informative, kind, and suggested the perfect \"Fido Burgers\" for our four legged kiddos. Unseasoned and plain, they fit the bill for our dogs.

The rosemary, olive oil, and sea salt shoestring fries were extraordinary. I'm not a fry girl at all, and I could eat these cold.

Exceptional service.  Exceptional quality food. Exceptionally clean bathrooms and dining room.

You WILL NOT be disappointed.  EVER."}
{"text":"Ived tried the Arizona burger and mushroom burger and they are both great. If you have a big appetite get the bigger burger but one small burger and sharing the sweet potato fries was awesome. Also this place serves beer in a frosty cold mug at pretty good prices."}
{"text":"Smash burger is great. They have tasty choices of burgers and amazing seasoned fries. One thing i would say is that their burger is super oily. I usually put it on it's side over 3-4 pieces of napkins to allow the oil to drain down. 
Other than that it's top notch burger for the price."}
{"text":"I was a little wary pulling up to this sacrilegeous burger joint that had intentionally set up shop literally next door to cult-favorite In-N-Out. I ordered a Sin City(?) burger with fried pickles and a beverage. It was delicious. The burger wasn't overcooked to an inch of it's life, like most rubes would like it and the fried pickle slices were tangy and suprisingly tasty. I actually got my food fairly fast too. Despite everything though, I don't think it could ever quite replace the people's beloved In-N-Out."}
{"text":"When you walk in it feels like you are at Jack In The Box but food quality is what makes the difference!!! Burgers taste more natural. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"As I drove almost daily past this re-modeled (disaster of a) strip mall, I was excited to see the new eatery coming to our neighborhood. I've heard about them in other parts of our City. The food is good, but not great. I had the grilled chicken salad and fries. Salad greens not crisp and the chix, so-so. The fries are cut so small that you might need tweezers to eat them! (LOL) Now the price. This small meal was $9.71 without a drink and small tip. An average price of $12 for lunch, right next to many other restaurants with much lower prices will not work for this business. I'm sure the manager at In and Out (next door) is laughing, as his/her sales go up and up. Students have an on-campus meal plan for around $7 ( all you can eat). Why would they pay $12 to walk off campus?
If they offer a combo for $7, they just might be able to pay the rent."}
{"text":"I don't get this place.  Hamburger squished so thin that it goes over the sides of the bun?  How does this help?  And the meat is so over salted that you don't actually taste anything else.  I tried the chicken sandwich to stay away from the \"smash\"; no luck.

There is an In-N-Out burger next door to this Smash Burger.  I recommend going to it instead."}
{"text":"A few people had reccommended smash burger for the longest time but I never tried it until my friend suggested we go for lunch the other day. When I walked in I was surprised how clean the place was, definitely an extra star for that. 

I had heard about the fried pickles and had to try them, you totally need to order them if you haven't, they are delicious! The burgers themselves are big and juicy and all of the ingredients taste and look fresh. The smash fries were pretty good though they were a little too oily. The servers were attentive and the booths comfortable. 

The only downside to me is the price, of course it's totally worth it but it probably wouldn't be my normal lunch spot because I would go broke fast."}
{"text":"The sin city burger lived up to the expectations-love the fried egg and grilled and fried onions. The smashfries were an added bonus with the rosemary touch!"}
{"text":"First time here and everything is great i didnt have the salty problem everyone else has mentioned.  Service was excellent and for anyone looking to try this place out they have menus now.  Maybe everyone else came to soon cut them a bit of slack they havent been open very long.  As someone who works in a kitchen i know mistakes are made but they will be fixed. Great food nice atmosphere will be back soon."}
{"text":"The BBQ bacon cheddar burger is a taste sensation. If I had one issue at all it's that I often burn my tongue on my first bite. I'm so eager to dig in, that I forget they use a super hot grill and the burger juices are HOT! It needs  a minute to cool off. The butterfinger shake is amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place. Such good quality, great flavors, and delicious shakes....... The crispy chicken was a tiny bit salty this time but those bleu cheese crumbles on my burger made me all but melt. So good....."}
{"text":"This place nails it for consistently good food. Where they fall short is in customer service and professionalism. The girls have skin tight yoga pants on and it gets really hard to eat when you watch Adult men, order food (while discreetly), so they think, burning a hole at these young ladies butts.  There shirts should be long enough to cover themselves. This isn't hooters! One female there cant even crack a smile when you place your order at the register. She has no personality no manners!
Then they all goof off near the kitchen. The environment is just unprofessional, burger place or not."}
{"text":"The first time I went here it was good and I was more than happy to spend the 10+ dollars for my food, however the second time I went there was something VASTLY wrong with my food. 

I ended up getting sick from eating and will not go to a SmashBurger ever again. They can keep their grease and poor food for the others who think it is worth the potential risk.

Even though there IS a kitchen and the food is made fresh I hold it in comparison to McDonalds and Wendy's with being able to be overlooked for something worth while."}
{"text":"I have been here a lot. Love the food. People are a hit and miss but the one gentleman I had the other day was phenomenal. His name was Vincent, I think. I had 2 separate orders and they were complicated and he was patient and made sure everything was perfect. Thank you Vincent."}
{"text":"Was pretty decent. Got the truffle and swiss burger.. Was not as good as the one I recently had at Aioli burger (food truck). Also fries were nothing special. Better than fast food but not much"}
{"text":"I had my choice of Islands Burger, Red Robin and Smash Burger all within walking distance from each other.  I decided to go to smash burger after I noticed it had 4 1/2 stars on yelp.  Fellow yelpers, you did not let me down, my hamburger was DELICIOUS!

I'm surprised I havent heard more about this place.

From the friendly staff to the cleanliness of the place to the taste of of the food, it left a good impression."}
{"text":"Horrible service and a horribly thrown together \"GOURMENT\" BURGER... My office in in the area so it would be nice if this store and it's team could get its act together.  I live near one of the Tempe locations and I believe Tempe may have just set the bar too high for this So Phx location to meet.  And the manager - Mike is childish and extremly unprofessional in how he interacts with the employees there and ever more so in his approach to others (myself).  He gets an F!!  Grow up Mike!!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is my guilty pleasure. Obviously the food is greasy and unhealthy, but it tastes so good that I must succumb to my urge occasionally. The service is exemplary, and vastly exceeds what you might expect from an establishment of this nature. Sweet potato fries, Arizona Smashburger, and a strawberry milkshake. mmmmmmm...."}
{"text":"Meat is dry. I got the mushroom burger and it wasn't tasty. It lacked everything and didn't even have burger sauce. It was just meat, cheese and a few mushrooms slapped into a bun without any other condiments. Chili fries were dripping with grease, they serve them on a cardboard plate so it could absorb the grease but they were drenched in red grease from the chili. Sweet potato fries not good enough, they're better at El Pollo Loco. My husband got the baja burger and he said it wasn't good either. It is way over priced for nasty food. Please don't compare to In n Out, not on the same page at all!!! The pictures are deceiving cause they look good but arent good at all."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! I came in the middle of lunch rush with a huge to go order for the whole office. Natalia took my order and personally packaged it up to make sure it was correct, each burger had a ticket taped to it so there was no guess work as to what was what when I got back. Even while they were super busy they got my order out in a few minutes."}
{"text":"Much better than five guys not even comparable. Enjoyed 3 meals at Smashburger recently."}
{"text":"I live close by this location but travel the extra distance to other Smashburgers as I don't feel the management is on top of things at the Lake Mead location. I don't eat meat but I do like the black bean burger. On two separate occasions, I was told they were out of the black bean burger when I ordered. The only non-meat burger on the menu and they did not have any? Actually, I was told the bean burger was not de-frosted. In any case, poor planning. One time was in the afternoon and the other visit was later in the evening. Overall the experience at this location is not on a par with the other Smashburgers..

The Smash Fries are very tasty."}
{"text":"While I enjoy the food at Smashburger, this location consistently disappoints.  There is often a line approaching the door, yet one cashier to take orders.  Often, many just turn around and walk out.  They'll gladly take your money, but won't bother to tell you that the kitchen is backed up for 45 minutes!  I've never once seen someone that appears to be an owner let alone someone who appears to have any investment in the customer experience here.  Instead the \"manager\" is a 20 year old kid managing his/her friends and clearly doesn't have any authority to make decisions let alone comp customers for a 45 minute wait for food.  They only tool is to simply offer an apology.  That's not good enough.  

I think I finally learned my lesson that this location is a waste of time and money and don't plan on being back.  I even sent the owner an email when his employees were running around the kitchen and the dining room in socks, yet he didn't have the decency to return the message.  Clearly his attitude is not to retain customers, so I'll happily lead the pack of those exiting and steering clear of this Smashburger.  One star because Yelp won't allow anything less, and the food is pretty good.  I love the idea of veggies and grilled chicken, but sadly the \"service\" at this location is consistently the worst I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"I wanted a burger the other day, decided to finally give Smash Burger a try. 
I went for the Arizona Big Burger. Guacamole, Jalapeno. Regular Smash Fries. Large drink. While the burger was nice and juicy, tasted very fresh.....I have to say the fries just weren't my style. Super thin and oily. I enjoyed the burger, but for the $12 I spent, there are just other places to go around here. While I didn't buy one, I have to say their Beer Prices were pretty ridiculous. $3.49 for a Can of Kilt-Lifter? $2.99 for a Can of Macro Domestic? C'mon. Then again I was in SnotsDale so I can't speak for the prices at other location. 
Will I go back? Maybe. Next time I will skip the fries and enjoy a better than average burger."}
{"text":"I placed a to very large to go order on the phone. When I came in to pick it up the line was nearly out the door so I asked if I could just pay, without standing in line (since my food was all ready just sitting on the counter in bags) and just grab the food. The girl there said she only had one register open and I had to wait in line. So as I wait for about 15 people, think, decide and pay, my food is getting colder and then by the time it's my turn she opens up another register! Really? She couldn't do that 15 people ago when my food was luke warm?!? Then as I'm carrying a drink and my hands are obviously full another girl tries to load all the bags into my hands. I nearly dropped everything. I'm 7 months pregnant so it's obvious I'm struggling and they don't even offer to help me out or leave my bags or drinks to make a few trips... NOTHING. By the time I ate the food, the fries were undercooked and freezing and the rest of the food was also very cold. They also messed up about 1/3 of the order. It was $114+ order; you'd think that they would have a little better customer service."}
{"text":"They have the right idea buuuuuut... 
Smash burger is reminiscent of a couple grills I favored as a kid back in the 60s and 70s... the burger, fried on the grill, mashed down making for crispy protein goodness on the exterior of the pattie... yum. And thin sliced onion rings salty sweet.... but the first thing I noticed was that the \"thin\" onion rings I favored were stuck together and therefore fat and greasy... also there was too much baking powder or soda in the breading... it made me feel like I needed a gallon of water to cleanse my palatte... don't bite on the special sauce they provide... go with the basics, mayo, mustard and ketchup if you're into that... Oh, and the idea that smashing the burger on the grill sears it and seals in the juices is a joke... when you smash the pattie on the grill the juices run out and coalesce on the outside as crispy proteins which is not a bad thing.

So they've  evidently made a hit with the public... and I say their product could be so much better... they just need to pay attention... especially with the onion rings.........."}
{"text":"great customer service by Aaron & Carlie , they were the best, as busy as it was tonight they were just amazing . the food was amazing !! will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Yum! Went here with my boyfriend and it was delicious. We both got Guac burgers and they were awesome. Ate ourselves into a coma. We are pretty picky about our burgers and the good stuff is typically 6-10$ so this was on the low range for us. Wonderful staff and we had a great time. 

Only gripe is there are quite a few messy tables and when I went a lot of really loud, obnoxious children haha. Geeze."}
{"text":"Edit: The manager of the Tempe location sent me a much appreciated written apology.  The regional manager, as well as someone else from corporate also called to apologize for my experience.  Three stars for the apology.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I went there and had a smash size burger with chili cheese fries and me and another person shared a haystack onions. The service was quick and nice. There was no attitudes here. 

The food was great. The burger was juicy, without being overly greasy. The chili cheese fries were tasty and came with jalapeño and diced onions. It's much better than eating at a normal fast food place where the fries are skinny and the chili and cheese aren't of the highest quality. You're not going to get five star restaurant quality, but it's a step up from normal chili cheese fries. The haystack onions were crispy and came with some sort of spicy mayo. The sauce was great and a good match for the onions. 

This is a great place to get a burger and hang out. It's better than normal fast food and reasonably priced. You can also have a beer with your meal if you want."}
{"text":"Love this place! It was so good I had to get a second chicken sandwich. I got chx, tomato, spinach, onion, cucumber, goat cheese, avocado, and an egg and loved it. Definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"Great place for a burger. Watching the assistant manager cruise through this place and make sure everyone has what they need is impressive.  Been quite a few years since I worked in the restaraunt business but all i remember assistant managers doing is sitting in the back room screwing off on naughty websites. Props smashburger good staff!"}
{"text":"This was a great burger experience. I had he bbq bacon burger and smash fries. I called in the order and ate most of the fries on my 10 minute ride home because I was afraid that thy would be nasty cold. I was wrong! My fiance had the sweet potato fries. They were still yummy once we got them home. I have driven by this place many times and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their burgers are very tasty and their fries are generous servings. I normally order the Avocado Club. Today I decided to try their Truffle Mushroom Swiss with a side order of smasher fries. The quality is not bad for the price. Also living their Reward program. This is my new 'go to' fast food joint. I see a free burger in my future. Nom, nom!"}
{"text":"Salt, salt salt then add a lot of oil.  This usually means your fast food place will be a success but these guys stepped it up about three notches of salt and oil over mcdonalds which I thought was impossible to pull off.  I couldn't stop laughing and feeling bad for the old man across from us because when he got his meal he grabbed the salt shaker and poured it on before tasting the salt lick they serve.I ordered the BBQ burger, sweet potatoe fries, and onion strings. All of these would of been good, but I couldn't taste anything but pounds of salt.  It got even more comical when I tried to gulp down some soda,and the dr. Pepper was as flat as a tire.  Dumped it out and got some coke, and same thing. Usually reviewers hit the nail on the head at yelp but this places reviews I don't get at all."}
{"text":"Seriously average. Waited in line a good 15 mins. Then another 15 for our burgers.

It's no Fuddruckers and you can plan on spending $15 with drink and fries.

Way average decent burger that was not worth the drive. Want a great burger try Lush in Scottsdale or Joes Farm Grill"}
{"text":"Really yummy! I personally like Chicken Burgers on egg buns. Chocolate shakes are good too, but thick, so I'd also order a soda or water with the shake."}
{"text":"The food is good but not worth the wait ! It took me over 30 mins to get a one burger to go and it wasn't even busy !"}
{"text":"I experienced my first Smashburger today. I had the classic burger, smashfries and tried some fried pickles. The burger's juicy meat is similar to a Five Guys burger, but everything else is different, like the smash sauce and egg bun -- which made the burger unique and delicious.

The smashfries were different (but good) as well, seasoned in rosemary and garlic. The fried pickles were alright, a little too salty for my taste though."}
{"text":"I wish I had seen the reviews below by the customer who had grey chicken, and the guy who had food poisoning.  I ate here Thursday, I picked up a meal to go and took it to work.  Once I had eaten a few bites I noticed it looked like ketchup was coming out of the inside of my meat patty, then I realized the inside of the burger was not cooked!  Too late I had already swallowed two bites.  I took it back the restaurant and the manager put his initials on my receipt for a free burger another day.  Not worth it because I am not going back.  Today I woke up with a churning gut and had to run to a doctor to get a prescription for anti-biotics.  Better than days on the toilet.  Something wrong in the kitchen at this place - a warning to all.  (BTW, a phone call to the corporate headquarters and I only got voicemail, left a message and no callback)."}
{"text":"My chicken sandwich  came as if it was refried multiple times. Im disappointed  at this smashburger location. Prolly wont be eating smashburger  again."}
{"text":"Well, I've heard alot about this place and was really excited to try it. Walking in, you feel like your going to get something different with an interesting menu and flavorful combinations. I ordered the the burger with pepper jack cheese, guac and jalapenos on a chipolte bun... sounds delicious, right? My expectations were dashed when I bit into a  burger that was tasteless, oily, ad crispy around the ages where it was smashed on the grill. My husband had the bbq with fried onions and had the same experience. We tried the smashfries and they were oily as well. Tasted like overcooked frozen fries to me... and the rosemary was tasteless. I don't know if this was an anomaly as so many  love this place..."}
{"text":"I like the concept.  Roll fresh \"Angus\" beef into meatballs every AM.  Smash them just before cooking.  But in reality, all beef is Angus.  It's the most popular type of cattle in the US.  And they must use the lowest fattiest (85%?) cut because the burgers are greasy.  And they come in either 5oz or 7oz patties.  Got a small smash and a side salad.  The salad was OK.  Burger with lettuce wrap had no wrap.  Just lettuce and tomato on the side.  So I had to eat my burger off the plate.  And it was greasy.  So not sure what to make of SB.  May try it again, but with In and Out so close, it's tough to make the move to SB.  If only In and Out had sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!  Love their menu.
Can't go back to regular fast food after eating there.
Great options for both beef and chicken, and even gluten free options."}
{"text":"BEWARE of FRAUD !  They swipe ur credit cards numerous times!!!! When u go back to them and speak to manager he says nothing they can do about it ....just call ur bank!  I should have been issued a credit immediately???.  BAD BUSINESS???
BEWARE of SMASHBURGERS on Frank Lloyd wright 
In Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but won't be coming back for quite a while. Got in tonight and the place was pretty empty but it took over 30min to get our food. My chicken sandwich was missing the cheese and my husbands burger was burnt and came out 10min after my sandwich. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I was starving and never tried Smashburger so I decided to give it a try. You walk in get your menu and proceed to the cashier to place your order. 

We walked to the cashier who was incredibly friendly to the guys in front of us who were in the army. It was so nice to see her joking and making their experience at Smashburger a treat. When my husband and I came up to place our order it is as if all friendliness has left. We did not get a warm greeting and I kinda felt like I was bothering her. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect the treatment she gave the guys before us, but I did expect at least a tid bit of friendliness. 

So we placed our order and the wait was not long, but I felt that the food was incredibly greasy especially the Smash fries which my husband ordered. We both have had plenty of experience attending restaurants but when you feel the need to sop up the grease from your burgers and fries, that is a bit much. I did think the burger was nicely seasoned and I enjoyed the variety of options available. 

Overall, I thought Smashburger was pricey. For two burgers, two order of fries and two orders of soft drinks a $22 price tag does take your breath away.  I do think if we come back we will most likely get the chicken and see how that is. Maybe the second time's the charm :)"}
{"text":"I'm 5 starring this place. I love their burgers, great service and did I mention their burgers are amazeballs? 

Only one time they messed up our order really bad, but gave us free meals for next time, so even that one bad experience they rectified. 

They also randomly gave us coupons for free sides. I'm not sure if that's because we frequent there or they do that for everyone. Hmmm I like to think I'm special. :) haha"}
{"text":"Was in the area of 99th Ave and McDowell and decided to go to Smash Burger.  I ordered a small classic smash burger add mayo easy onion, a smash burger with no onion, and a single order of fries.  It took them 3 tries to get the sandwiches correct, the result being that I had to put the onion on the burger myself.  The french fries were cold, and the the meal was not something I enjoyed.  As I worked my way through the burger, the patty was smashed thin which made it easy to be overcooked, and it was, and dried out.  

I frequent the Smash Burger at I-17 and Happy Valley.  Their Burgers are why I even like Smash Burger to begin with.  I love the burgers there.  I've always gotten nice juicy burgers that make me want to eat the whole thing.  I asked why the difference, and they said they must have different equipment.

As I sat here writing this review, I grew more and more suspicious.  It's BOGO, and the total is feeling like it was too high.  I get a copy of the receipt and sure enough, the BOGO isn't on there.  A certified trainer went and asked the person who took our order about it, and came back to us and said she didn't hear us.  I feel compelled to call this what it was... a lie!  When we placed the order, I told her I had the BOGO offer to which she replied, she knew the code so not to worry.  Why can't they just admit the mistake and apologize for it.  Would have made the experience a little more forgiving.  As it stands, it's a horrible place to eat, the staff can't be trusted, they'll probably make your food wrong, and no matter the offer, GET A RECEIPT! Verify that you were charged correctly.  More and more places are making the issuing of a receipt optional, and they default to no receipt. It's turning out to be a practice best reserved to places you frequently visit, and trust.  All others give me proof. 

Not a place it would recommend to friends or strangers. Now the one off I-17 and Happy Valley, they're awesome.  Never a problem in about 13-15 orders. Every one was just as good as the first."}
{"text":"Slow service and only one register on a Friday night.  The line is out the door. Stop cutting your labor and get some help.  Will never come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Love smashburger!!! The smash fries are awesome and the sweet potato fries even better. Clean and service is great."}
{"text":"I have visited several Smashburger Restaurants, but, more recently on Power Rd.  As always the burger was \"great!\"   The fries are the best! I always leave there very full. The prices are reasonable.  I will return soon  YUM"}
{"text":"Sin City burger is great.  It's just something about a burger with an egg on it.  Smash fries are good, but I'll pass on the sweet potato fries.  Only issue is that the smash fries are covered in oil, so it's a little messy.

Here's hoping they don't meet the demise of every other place that has been in that location over the past decade."}
{"text":"We found ourselves venturing out to Monroeville to try Smashburger because Seriouseats.com rated them the #1 fast food burger.  It did not disappoint!  I ordered a regular size classic smashburger with fried pickles.  My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger smash with smash fries (tossed with rosemary/olive-oily goodness).  The burgers came out fast and they looked great!  Fresh, colorful, crisp veggies on top, and a perfectly cooked burger.  The place is clean and sharply decorated (think Chipotle but with burgers).  I wish there were more people there, because we think this place is really good!  It's much less greasy than Five Guys, and with nicer atmosphere.  Plus, the price was right- we feasted for $20! Nom nom."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. Their burgers were too greasy and the fries were cold. I told my bro in law to try it and he got the shrimps (runs)! Never will I go back!! =["}
{"text":"One of my fav burger places! I'll keep coming here again and again. My only complaints are about the black bean patty and the fried pickles. I got the black bean patty once and it was not good, sorry veggies but this isn't the place to come for a veggie burger! Stick to the meat and you'll never be disappointed. As far as the pickles go they're always really salty but honestly I still order them every other time I come here so it's not really that big of a deal lol"}
{"text":"ok..this place just rocks. Great burgers, great employees, great fries...enough said. 

Ok, i think I am hungry now..."}
{"text":"Fantastic spicy black bean (veggie) burger. Option for carrot/green bean fries is really cool - so my kids can get their veggies even at a hamburger joint! The sweet potato fries are a great alternative too. This place is always clean. They also serve beer, which isn't for me, but it's another thing that makes this restaurant stand out vs. other burger options."}
{"text":"Greasy greasy and salty. This place is not cheap and not good. 

There are a lot of options out there like in and out or Burgerfi. 

I ordered their special which is just a two patties of beef and cheese. My hand is covered in grease. I think I might be staining my leather phone case writing this review."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Love the create your own and getting goat cheese on the burger. The one downfall is that the egg is over hard, which I wouldn't order as I prefer over medium to have the runny yolk. Other than that one tiny pick, it's amazing! The burger is too much for me to have a side of fries to myself so it's a good idea to share. The service here is great!
We ate in silence the entire time unless we were mumbling about how good it is, and keeping me silent is hard to do!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how amazing & sweet the staff was to my daughter tonight. My daughter has a long list of food allergies- 2 of the worst being wheat/gluten & corn (corn syrup, corn meal, corn starch, etc.), needless to say, we are forever challenged at many restaurants. Aside from the already difficult task she has eating out, some staff members get annoyed when we have to ask about each item & its ingredients. 
Jalissa & Gwendle were not only patient, they were unbelievably helpful, informative & sweet!  It's nice to know they have many options for her (or anyone else suffering the same allergies, or just looking for healthy alternatives), & that Smash Burger uses many fresh ingredients to prepare their food!  We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"It was busy today. But everyone seemed happy and not waiting to long.

My to go order was quick. My sweet potato fries crispy and sweet and just enough salt. My mushroom Swiss grilled chicken sandwich very moist but it made the bun soggy. 

The place is small and cramped when full. There is indoor and outdoor seating. But once your in line you are boxed in. The is a wall o. One side a half a wall on the other and people in front and behind you. So ink twice before stepping into line.
 When you place your order they have a cool digital screen that lays out the order for you and you swipe your Credit card on the side of e screen when prompted .

I'm going back!"}
{"text":"burgers are awesome, place is a bit pricey, way overcrowded during the times I have been there and the sides (onion strings and fries) were just ok. Definitely a must try though at least one time."}
{"text":"All the wonderful food in Vegas and I find myself at Smashburger. I got the Spicy Chicken Baja because my friends and I needed food and figured something familiar and good would do the trick.  I got the veggie frites as well. Always a solid option whether you are in town from Cali or if you are in Nevada. Give them a try especially if In n Out is busy and you aren't scared to try something new (food came out fast)."}
{"text":"Went in on a Wednesday night 5:30 with my 10 year old son.  He had the kids burger with a drink.  I got the Avocado Club.  Was awesome.  My son wanted a second burger even though he was full.  Food was served quickly.  Sat down and saw a steady stream of people coming through."}
{"text":"Went to Smashburger last week with my dad for the first time. That location just opened and he lives five minutes away. He admitted that he's been there 5 times in the last 7 days!!!
I was very impressed. Tasted like a burger I had in Beverly Hills for $50!
Very fresh, outstanding flavor. The Smash fries were awesome also.
Nice environment. A little noisy, but that adds to the experience. The staff is all great; very attentive and all seem to truly be enjoying themselves. 
The only very minor critique I could come up with is they need to find somewhere else to plug in their rechargeable vacuum cleaners; just looked a bit tacky near the public restrooms while the rest of the place is very polished; I'm guessing they're way ahead of me on this! 
Will I be back? You bet! 
My only concern is that my dad will be having breakfast, lunch and dinner there!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place out, and I wasn't dissapointed. The employees were nice and I got my order around 6 or 7 minutes later, and they were really busy! I got the smash burger and an order of regular fries. I ordered it to go as I didn't have time to dine in, if I dined in it would of been 5 stars most likely. The fries were really good, lightly salted and crispy. They were hot and when I got home they were still warm, so no complaints! Next time I will try the smash fries. Now, on to the burger! It was really good, my complaint is the way it was kind of thrown together....I had about a 10 minute drive back home so when I got home the bun was soggy due to the sauce (see picture) the way it was presented could use some improvement. If I dined in it most likely wouldn't have been an issue, just seems like they put too much sauce and it got all over the bun. I'll certainly eat here again, just a bit pricey since you have to buy everything seperate. Similar to five guys in that aspect, overall it was good! My bill at this location for a smash burger, regular size fries and a regular size drink was 10 bucks and some change. Burger (5.29) regular fries (1.99) and regular drink (1.99)  Just incase anyone was curious about pricing before you go :)"}
{"text":"Great food especially sweet potatoes were amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome Awesome!!! 
This was sooooooooo yummy good!! My hubby is raving about the meat seasoning in the Sin City burger and I'm dying over how incredibly good they made a chicken sandwich!! (The avocado chicken BLT is TO DIE FOR!!!!)
AMAZING!!!! And the Smashfries are DROOLICIOUS!!!!

The gentleman that helped us and brought us our food is THE NICEST, kindest and most energetic person I have ever come across! They have beat and pummeled Red Robin, to win over my new #1 burger place!"}
{"text":"Average burgers over priced.  No atmosphere.   Some one said let's make it cheap and over charge for the food.  Bam. We have a business plan.  

Cold beer and cheeseburgers is now a short drive away for a good burger.   Or four peaks has a burger for less price 

Too many options in no scottsdale for this place. 

Burger did not settle well for a friend and i... too greasy? Too buttery?  Whatever not good to be I'll the next day"}
{"text":"Awesome so good! Best thin fries!! Best deep fried pickles!! Great chain .. will always come back !!"}
{"text":"Today was mine and my family's first experience with smash burger. We decided to use the online ordering and pay in advance and pick up at a certain time. That feature was nice and they had it all ready by the time I got there to pick it up. Or so we thought all of it was ready and there. 

We got home to realize that the salad dressing for one of the salads was missing and we were missing a smash fry as well. These are both small items , but still frustrating since, to correct this issue, we would have to get back in the car and return to where we had just came. With NCAA final four happening - who wants to do that? And I'm sure the smash fry tastes glorious - but I was shafted from that experience unfortunately. 

Secondly, we got two house side salads and they looked completely different. There wasn't any consistency. One salad looked to have all the toppings while the second one just had lettuce and nothing else. Pretty disappointing. And since I didn't have dressing - I have to wait until I go to the store to get some. 

Thirdly, the chicken sandwiches we got was explained as 'they flattened chicken and threw it on a George foreman grill'. There was no marinating and it was about the thickness of a piece of paper. There were times my friend was eating the sandwich and could not even tell if he was getting any chicken. 

I would say that I would likely not go here again just from this one experience. The burger that I had tasted fine and wasn't bad quality - but not worth the price considering these pit falls."}
{"text":"We simply ordered online to-go. When we got there to pick up our food, it was ready and they were more than happy to hand me a side of ranch as well. When we got home, the food was just as we ordered it and their Smash Fries are amazing! Only downside to the whole experience was that my fiance's burger had 3 wimpy pieces of bacon. So fix the portion size of your bacon SmashBurger! :) I prefer this to 5 Guys"}
{"text":"So here I am standing between In-N-Out, Cafe Rio and... some new place SmashBurger. I missed my lunch break so I'm more than just hungry at 4pm so I'm in a mood for something substantial.

It's a burger joint but it took me a couple minutes to figure out the menu and cashier was not really helpful in explaining what's what so I decide to settle on mushroom swiss burger (how bad can it be, right?) and sweet potato fries (can't mess it up either, right?).

So after 5 minuted I get my tray and...
Burger: meat is good, cheese is just 1 slice barely covering half of the patty and mushrooms are... pretty much non-existent. It came with no lettuce and tomato so I had to ask for them from kitchen (and cashier never even mentioned that I need to ask for it all!) 

Sweet potato fries: epic fail... pool of oil on a bottom of the basket! That's the first time ever I had to ask for refund in a fast-food! But heck no, I'm not paying for the oil change... even McD can do fries better.

Bottom line: FAIL. Bill (before refund for fries) was more than $8 (and no drink!) So.... stick with the establishment next door for burgers - for $8 I'll get burger, fries and milk shake. I wonder how long will this place last here..."}
{"text":"This chain should be renamed to Grease-burger instead! We ordered 2 burgers and fries. Ordered sin city burger and avocado burger. Sin City burger consists of greasy onion rings, overfried egg, greasy chunk of smashed ground beef and greasy soft bacon... It's 30 degrees outside so I managed to eat more than a half thinking that I'll have to burn calories outside anyway. But I couldn't make myself to touch fries. First they gave us lukewarm portion of greasy fries which I returned to the kitchen and asked for hot and not so greasy portion... instead I got another pile with poodle of oil on a bottom of the basket. For &&*! sake - is it possible to make a pile of potatoes right? It probably cost you 30c to make it so why can't it be edible at least. How come even McD does better job for 1/3 of the price?

I've gone to Smash a couple years ago with exactly the same result... I hoped something changed but alas no luck. The only bright side is that we had a 241 coupon so the total was only $12 for 2 (but I'd rather have gone to INO down the street for same money).

Bottom line: save it for better times unless you need an oil change."}
{"text":"Burgers are super messy and get soggy really fast.  They slop on the sauce like it's going out of style.  Overall flavor is good, but it turns into mush by the end.  I thought it was a fluke but my burger is always like that.  I need to remember to ask for light condiments or get them on the side.  

Fries are shoestring style and great when hot/fresh.  The \"smash fries\" are drowning in oil so stick to the regular fries.

The shakes are great, very thick and creamy.  The service is always friendly, quick, and the restaurant is very clean.

Five Guys and Lenny's have better burger/fries but  this place is OK once in a while."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  They cook their burgers and chicken fresh to order and you can tell the difference from all of the other competition. Well done smash burger!"}
{"text":"While the burger tasted good, like your average burger, I did not feel that it was anything special. When you pay over $10 for a meal at a burger joint you expect it to be a little better than other fast-food burger chains. 

Worth a first try. I won't be going back.

also one of the top reviews is \"Don't hate the chain-haters who say it's expensive\" ... 

I didn't know this was a chain and it IS over-priced. See for yourself but don't be surprised when it's mediocre."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers I've ever tasted in my entire life, bar none. I have tasted dozens of burgers at dozens of places over the years and nothing compares. 

I have eaten here dozens of times and every time I go to a restaurant or an expensive burger/pub place, I always wish I had gone here instead.

I have also come to find out they have best hotdogs I've ever tasted.  The staff is also very nice and I only I wish there was one on every corner.

Note, the mushroom truffle Swiss burger is one of the best creations I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger in town for my money. I always get the mushroom Swiss burger and it's tender, juicy and perfectly cooked. It can be fairly noisy and busy for lunch and they play strange music at times, but not as annoying as hearing Mariah Carey and Michael Bolton screaming at you as some places do. The staff is always friendly and the place is clean and well organized. I have been coming here for the past 3 years and can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Wow! So went there tonight they were super busy! Had two super hungry kiddos, the guy who took my order look pretty frazzled. I guess he forgot too write down all the modifications and our order came back totally wrong. After all was said and done the manager came and fixed everything! He refunded our money gave us smash bucks for next time and re made my meal and even slipped in some extra Fry's! Needless to say the awesome manager fixed a sticky situation and the burger was fantastic! We will be back!"}
{"text":"SmashBurger didn't disappoint, the atmosphere was friendly and the food was good.  I also recommend the sweet potatoe fries and chocolate malt."}
{"text":"Food's good and avocado on the menu. Yay!   However,  what's with the styrofoam cups and plastic burger boxes? Seems a little tone-deaf for 2013."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. They advertise 100% Angus beef, which no doubt it is, but the burgers are out of balance. The taste of the beef is lost due to too many other flavors in the burgers. Sweet potato fries are excellent. Best choice would be a beer and the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Trash burger was so bad I had to drink a whole can of coke and a cup of extra bold coffee just to begin the process of liberating my molested taste buds from the odious remnants of \"burger\" stubbornly clinging to my palette and degrading its integrity like barnacles cementing themselves to the hull of a vessel. 

Short version: This place is cabbage."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, tasty and I don't know why anyone is complaining about the size -- generous fresh toppings, fluffy fresh bun, plenty of delicious beef.  Smash fries are the way all french fries should be made -- seasoned, light, crispy, delightful. Easy to customize your order, or lots of good combos to choose from quickly, food was made to order very quickly, server was pleasant and helpful, all around great experience. No, it's not a fancy restaurant -- it's fast food, just so much better than most competitors.  They are a (small) bit more expensive than some fast food places, but definitely worth the extra buck or so.  WIll be back, often."}
{"text":"To eat a ChicagoDog outside of Chicago city limits or not to eat a ChicagoDog in AZ....uuuuhhmmmmm, definitely the latter! 

Not a fan of the hot dog, nor their \"rosemary\" fries. The food was SOOO BLAND. I ordered mine to-go, and there was maybe a a handful of fries in the little box and a cold dog. booo!

I took it home and doctored it with celery salt and mustard... and washed it down as fast as I could with a tasty brew... all that for the absurd price of $7.00! 

I might be tempted to go back and try a burger..but probably not....

negatory."}
{"text":"Called ahead to order one AZ smash and one classic.
Was ready in less than 10 min.
Impressive service.
Everybody's upbeat, friendly, took accurate orders and confirmed, gave estimate.
Food was fresh and tasty. Love.
Def going back again."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about. I ordered a burger, fries, and shake. It was just ok. Shake was amazing but aren't they all? 5 guys and In n Out are much better."}
{"text":"Love their burgers! The egg bun is delish and hamburger meat is fresh and tasty.  I loved the smash fries before they changed it to the skinny shoe string fries, hence the 1 star deduction.  Make sure to get a milk shake to wash down your meal.  My fav is the caramel vanilla shake, yum!"}
{"text":"The Best burger in town next to In and Out.  I truthfully haven't tried \"The Habit\" yet but better than Five Guys in my opinion.  Try it!  I always get my burger on the Chipolte bun!  Try the Chipotle mayo too!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and chicken sandwiches.  My fav is the Spicy Baja Chicken sandwich with Smash Fries!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at this location for over a year. The staff is super friendly and always willing to go the extra mile. The burgers, chicken sandwiches and fries are all among the best available at fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Good burger but kind of expensive as burgers go. The french fries were just so-so, a little greasy. Other than that, ok. Wish they had a drive thru."}
{"text":"People are nice, food is amazing (best burgers i've had in my life), and the whole restaurant is nice. Period."}
{"text":"The classic Smashburger had good flavor. It was a little messy to eat and layers tended to slide around - like you had to eat the whole thing without putting it down. And it didn't taste quite as good after I looked up the calorie-count.  Fries were very greasy. Likely will eat elsewhere next time through Sky Harbor Airport."}
{"text":"Again ever time I go into this Smash burger. I always have the best time with my family. I love this place. Katrina and Jennifer always have a smiles on their face and make us feel welcome. I will be back again soon with my family. Thanks for always making us feel like home."}
{"text":"I visited SmashBurger the first time yesterday. Their burgers are pretty good. They are cooked fresh. No frozen patties there.  My new burger spot. When I want a good burger."}
{"text":"Is it me or is this place getting worse since the grand opening from a year ago? The last several visits, I have had the same conclusion that the burgers are not the same as when they were earlier. Another person in our party stated the chicken is not as good. I ordered the Big smash while my son ordered a regular smash burger and they looked almost identical in size. I think this place is cutting back. The burgers now taste average at best."}
{"text":"Ordered an avocado chicken sandwich with the spicy fries. Both were delicious, although I could've done with less salt on the fries. Awesome, fast service, the cashier made polite convo. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Today I went to Smashburger and it was pretty good. The wait was long and the burgers were quite oily.Would I recommend going to Smashburger, yes but not on a Friday during lunch time because it was very busy."}
{"text":"I love SmashBurger and this is my favorite location.The food is always cooked perfectly and everything is always fresh.The restaurant is always clean and the staff are always friendly and attentive. I love love love the Smash fries. My absolute favorite burger place."}
{"text":"I usually love SmashBurger but this location is the absolute worst. They take forever, their service sucks and they consistently f#%k the order up. At this point, it's nobody's fault but my own I'm dissatisfied with this place. I guess I keep coming hoping it's going to better but it's just not. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This was my third visit. If based on my first visit I would have rated them a 4 - 4.5, consistency seems to be an issue. They make a good burger and the sides are very good. the chocolate shake is a chocolate lovers dream. But at this writing I really don't know if you will get a great burger or just an OK burger?"}
{"text":"The food is still good but the service is not so great. The food came before the drinks. Pretty lame. We will probably go back because it's the food that matters."}
{"text":"Love the food here actually the Az smash reg fries & drink! The flies are gettin Redic though. OTHER than that BOMB food! :)"}
{"text":"This a perfect spot for reasonably priced, delicious food. The staff was very friendly and service was fast. The staff make sure to do a thorough job of cleaning. It's very close to NKU, so it's a wonderful stop for students (or staff)."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with the family. We ordered two salads, two bottles of water and a kids meal. 
We had a coupon for \"buy one entree get one entree for $1\"
We were denied using the coupon because their scanning system was not working. 
Ok fine, take off the two $2 bottles of water? 
Nope!  They won't do that. Not their problem that their own scanner is not working. 
Poor management!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites, but not for my health kick. Think indulgent. I recommend the sin city with fried pickles and a frosty beer."}
{"text":"Overpriced burgers.  Sweet potato smashfries were good. I like the fact that they support a local craft brewery-Four Peaks. Staff was very welcoming. Three words In-n-out."}
{"text":"I went to this location tonight for the first time and overall the visit wasn't bad. However I was disappointed that both mine and my boyfriends orders were written properly on the ticket but still came out wrong served to us by the one who took our order. The food wasn't bad but it would've been better if we didn't have to pick off the mound of condiments we did not wish for. One of which I am allergic to. The service was quick but there was a few minute wait between the time they brought my boyfriends food and mine. Again the food was good but the staff could've been a little more attentive."}
{"text":"I came in at 940 right before close for take out and Jose and the crew made me feel right at home and when I got home the burger s were amazing! I got the sin city burger and it was on point."}
{"text":"Good food but overpriced. Everything is a la carte. Had BBQ burger... It was good liked the egg bun; disliked that it wasn't warm. Daughter got chicken fingers... Well done; not processed meat. Cashier was friendly. Worked the register and wiped down tables.  If they were to lower price and offer combinations might return.. Oh and the freeze fried veggies were alright. Wanted them crunchier on the outside and tender inside.

Dress: come as u r"}
{"text":"Absolutely rubbish. Paid $45 for my family. 
Portions small so expected quality. Oh no. 
Burgers were pink. Fries where soo greasy. 
Tables were messy. Won't be back

Disappointed beyond belief"}
{"text":"Burgers are Great.  Smashbuger is great.  

I stopped in here last week for the first time thinking that I had already tried it.  Obviously I had not enjoyed this establishment because I would have remembered the amazing fries.  

They turned the ordinary burger into something a bit more special with their egg buns and great types of burgers to choose from.  Yes chuck box is just over, but when you go into chuckbox after you leave you feel as though you need a shower. 

Here you can enjoy a burger and you can take it to go if you have somewhere to be.  They also have a special where you can get a burger fries and a drink for 7 bucks if your an ASU student. 

Recommendation: If you are in tempe or on ASU's campus in tempe, drop in during your break and get some good eats."}
{"text":"Just wanted to share my experience with you.  Went for dinner at smash burger on Ann/centennial in Las Vegas.
Food all over floors and tables.  Chicken tender kids meals fried to a dark brown crisp.  Buffalo chicken sandwich served ice cold.  Goat cheese chicken sandwich served without cucumber, balsamic or goat cheese. (All listed ingredients)
Super disappointed.
Had been previously about a year ago.  Roof was leaking and after a looooooong wait was informed that fryer was down so no fries or tenders available. They apologized and gave us a coupon to return.
Well, two strikes..."}
{"text":"Really nice place for a nice burger and fries. Definitely create your own would be the way to go, although some of the specialties are awesome too. Make sure you grab the smash fries they have a really nice flavor."}
{"text":"Great AZ chicken burger. Shoe string fries are good. Yummy shakes! Good size kid meal portions."}
{"text":"So I am not a fan of fast food. My husband and 2 young boys wanted to try Smash Burger (777 E College Ave, Tempe, AZ) before we went to the airport and they somehow convinced me to go.

It was a Monday 12:30pm so it was very crowded. We ordered our lunch but had to wait for a table to open. Our food was almost ready and my young boys were getting restless, but still no table. The cook in the back came out with fries and gave them to my boys to hold them over -- nice touch. The manager and 1 other person were hustling to clear and clean tables so that we could sit down faster. We sat down and boy was I surprised at what appeared on the table! Fresh, hot burgers and the most delicious fries seasoned with a hint of rosemary. My sons also ordered a chocolate shake which looked mouth watering!

I have never experienced tastier food, friendlier staff or for that matter, staff that hustle, as much as I experienced at the 777 E. College Ave location on Mon 3/19, 12:30pm

My only complaint is that there is not a Smashburger location in the city limits of Chicago! We cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Everything is great. Get a milkshake, smash fries and try a buckeye burger. Service is quick and the burgers are the best fast food offers. Haystack onions and sweet potato fries are also good."}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening and received a free Burger. It tasted like a hone cooked burger. I thought the grilled chicken had too much pepper though. But the french fries= amazing. Before I got to my seat, the burger was there. Angus beef is delish. I went back a few more times and will continue this week."}
{"text":"Made it to smashburger a few days after it opened at night,, i created my own burger and got the smash fries. The burger was fresh as was the bun, the fries were brushed in a olive and garlic mixture that was quit pleasing when the fries are hot and fresh, so eat those first or fast because they loose the \"taste\" if they get cold. ..
if you want a cup to fill up with a refill before you leave make sure you ask for a take out cup...

I went back last week for lunch...... that was a different experience, the food was still good but it took FOREVER!! myself along with everyone there gets about 1h for a lunch break everyone was looking at their watch because it took over 45 min to get orders out, 2 people asked for a refund because they had to get back to work and would not have time to eat, i was also rushed to eat my food and get back to the office on time... the line up did not get shorter,  there was a packed house..."}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty and chili was meaty, more so than I anticipated. Good place to go for fresh ingredients and quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This Smashburger location seem to be totally 'on point' or flat sucks judging by the other reviews. 4 of us went there last night we were all highly impressed so it gets its full 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken baja burger (to go) and it was delicious! First time there, definitely going again. Fries were delicious as well. Fresh toppings, bun was fresh and toasted and less expensive some of the other nearby options. Five guys doesn't compare to the options you have at Smashburger.

I can't comment on the dining experience - but takeout was great!"}
{"text":"The burger and fries were great. It was busy when we went, but not so crowded as to make the place difficult or uncomfortable. Just right.

The guy behind the counter was cool and friendly.

I know that I will eat here again."}
{"text":"If you want a tasty fast burger this is it!  Clean and friendly service.  They even clear the table for you.  They also have some of the best sweat potato fries I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I just moved here and discovered this fun burger spot. They have gluten friendly options and their bugers and fries are great. Ill be back to try more things."}
{"text":"Great burger. Got the American  and tegular fries  burger was very juicy and flavorful. Hubby had the classic with  smash fries. He thoroughly enjoyed it. Next time we will only get one order of fries as there were plenty to share."}
{"text":"This was our third time visiting this Smashburger, each time has been a wait, but its new so its to be expected.

Tonight, we waited for 55 minutes to get our meal amongst screaming children and loud teenagers.  When our burgers finally arrived they were cold and dry.

Never again will I eat here, in fact, if I could give this place less than 1 star I would."}
{"text":"The salad containers were a temporary problem (from my previous review).  I love Smashburger!!  This location is consistently good and the food is high quality."}
{"text":"This place makes me sad because I almost like it more than In-N-out...it's soooo good! This place was clean and although fully staffed with youngin's they were doing their job and got our food out quickly. I'm always awkward about how to deal with trays but they make it a little less awkward to deal with since they came right away and took away our trash"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, as it's close to my house & the food is always good. Tonight I stopped by on my way home from work since I was craving one of their milkshakes. It was 9:35pm & I'm aware they close at 10. 
My complaint is about the server/cashier Robin. Not only did she not greet me upon my entering, while I was looking at their milkshake selection, she couldn't even pretend to give a crap that I was there. Messing with her hair, and blatantly using her phone right in front of me with her head down and all. Aside from all that, when it came to the actual transaction, she was hasty and unpleasant, couldn't even fake a smile. Once she made my milkshake I thanked her and got no response. I couldn't wait to get out of there because she made me so uncomfortable.
The two stars I gave were because my milkshake was good, so I got what I came for. But I could've done without the attitude & unprofessionalism that the cashier Robin gave me."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a random day. The avocado sandwich looked good but I didn't want a club sandwich. The cashier suggested the avocado ranch burger & it was DELICIOUS!  I also ordered sweet potato fries & again delicious. I think I  like this location better than the one on flamingo . Very clean and the cashier/server asked if I wanted anything to go with fries while I was waiting. Awesome staff amazing food! You'll love it."}
{"text":"Very salty fries, coke was only selzer water, also salty burger. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger, but I have to agree it's overpriced. Service is excellent, place is clean and bright. I'll have to try their fries next time..."}
{"text":"Overall the food was good except my burger was very undercooked. So if you decide to stop in for a burger there make sure you tell them to cook it well done or just to the point where the meat is not mushy like mine was."}
{"text":"Service at this smashburger is crazy good! Mike took our order food came out quickly and hot! Mike was also running around bussing tables bringing boxes just a real pleasure thank you Mike"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. We ordered a side of fries and they didn't arrive until we finished our meal. When we approached Andrew about our order, he told us if we were missing something then we should have gone up there and told him because he is too busy with other orders. We did not even get an apology so therefore I asked for a refund. His bad attitude continued at the register when returning the money. I'm more than positive a MacDonald's employee has better customer service than he does. This type of rude attitude just degrades this restaurant and I will make sure family and friends don't support this location so the experience is not repeated."}
{"text":"Not the best place for burgers or to eat at at all. It took two attempts to bring the food I ordered. I almost had to put on my glasses for finding the burger. It tasted dry and quality of the meat was low. The fries weren't good but far better than the burger. I won't come back."}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes after we place our order before we asked for a refund and left. Just opened so I'm sure there is going to be some growing pains. Looked like a lot of confusion. May try again once the work out all the bugs. Although the owner seemed indifferent when he had an associate refund my credit card. A little pricey. Hamburger fries and a drink 14.00"}
{"text":"Never an issue coming to expect a great 'fast-food' burger. One of my favorites, and also a great place to be casual with a beer. Service is usually good, 'Smash fries' are excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome fries, the smashfries are awesome and burgers are also really good. A chain that runs throughout the country and a very good chain burger place."}
{"text":"Smashburger is my favorite fast food burger.  Solid selection of burgers, can't go wrong with an egg on the burger so I love that option. Fries are the really thin cut style which I like as well. Friendly staff, quick service and overall an awesome fast food burger"}
{"text":"I work close by and their are a lot of us who visit Smashburger to eat.  The burger is is good, fresh and made to order.  My rating is more about customer service at this location.  Today when I went to in to order and yes I had a coupon because they give them to us all the time.  So if the coupon is buy one and get one free, be prepared to have to order extras.  I just wanted the two sandwiches and was told I couldn't do that.  Nowhere on the coupon did it say with extra sides or drinks.  Just very disappointing that we spend so much at this location and they have zero customer service"}
{"text":"I got a bacon avocado club on a chicken patty with pickle chips and my boyfriend got a build your own burger. We are shocked at how amazing everything was the bacon and avocado was so fresh and cooked to perfection. Best pickle chips I've ever had. Not to mention the guy who took our order was very polite and patient with us. Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I AM AN OFFICIAL YELPER!!!!!! 

whew, now that I got that out of my system I need to thank Gabi for inviting us cool hip yelpers to Smash Burger. This was my first yelp event. I went with Don S. for some good ol' father daughter yelping bonding. Between the great people, the wonderful conversation, and general excitement, I have to say this was a wonderful lunch out. 
Now for the niddy griddy. You might be asking yourself \"Whassup? Why didn't they get 5 stars if it was a great lunch event?\" or \"whahappened?\" as they say in my family. 
My main judging points with restaurants and bars is food and service. I've eaten in dumpy little hole in the walls but would give them 5 stars cause the food was great and so was the service. 
Here at Smashburger, the service was most certainly friendly. We were greeted with a smile and fairly quickly. Off to a great start. I started to look at the menu, and it was very interesting. They had fried veggies (which I really like and highly recommend). But here is where it totally lost me. there were no vegetarian options. For a college town, I found this to be weird. Where's the love guys? So I was forced to construct a burger without the meat. The lady at the front was as kind as she could be, but looked at me like I had lobsters crawling out from my ears. All in all the food was great, and my specialty meal was made very well. But show the vegetarians some love! I mean come on!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is a success. Burgers were great in taste and the price was reasonable. I wasn't to crazy about the milkshakes. There wasn't anything special about them. The smash burger sauce was excellent. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is horrible, bacon was burnt to a crisp twice! The bottom of my hamburger patty was rick hard. I ordered smash fries and basically got regular fries. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"With this being my first time at a Smash burger I walked away completely satisfied!! I ordered the avocado club burger and it was cooked to perfection. The burger was juicy and all the toppings were fresh! I added the smash fries to my meal and they complemented the burger great! I will definitely be back again as I left a happy customer!"}
{"text":"Crazy loud and TONS of kids. Not bad food, but you can get better burgers and fries elsewhere, not such a long wait and definitely not leave with a migraine from screaming children."}
{"text":"Thanks to my good friend (and Charlotte's best new photographer) Lindsay H., I was able to check out Smashburger's sneak peek tasting on Saturday.  

I'll admit that the only reason I agreed to go to said event is because I rarely turn down free food.  The idea of yet ANOTHER gourmet burger joint in town coupled with having to head into suburban hell would not have tickled my trigger sans \"free food\" tagline.  If I want to pay $10 for a burger I can go to The Liberty, Big Daddy's, Pinky's, Burger Co, or Nix and not leave the 3 mile radius that I like to confine myself to on most days.  Fortunately, 485 was accident/idiot-free and I made it to Rea Rd. in record time.  It's a good thing, too, because Smashburger did not disappoint.  

I'm not lying when I tell you that since Saturday I've eaten only one full meal.  I ate so much food (forced eating, I must add) that I've been living off of my dromedary hump for 2 days.  [insert Fergie music here]  And the food was right on.  Fresh ingredients and plenty to choose from.  I certainly don't want to describe in detail every menu item that I sampled, but I'll list them out below and tell you that most are worth trying.  It should be noted that the sweet potato fries are a bit rosemary-centered and the brunswick stew fries were not really my idea of a fun time.  But if you like stew-drenched fries you'll love these.  And the rundown of what I am currently burning off:

Baja Burger
Baja Chicken Sandwich
Carolina Burger
Harvest Salad
veggie frites
sweet potato fries
brunswick stew fries
haystack onions
chocolate milkshake
Oreo milkshake"}
{"text":"My daughter loves the hamburgers here.  Every other place is chicken tenders/nuggets or pizza. Here she looks at the menu and orders a cheeseburger with different toppings each visit. Smash fries are a must as well. You could lose a finger trying to sneak one of her smash fries away. If she had her way every meal would be here. 

My only wish is that they offered larger bun sizes."}
{"text":"I stop at this location weekly. The service is wonderful and all the employees are excellent. They are friendly and polite and if you don't know what you want, they make suggestions. They are always smiling and greet you when you come in and thank you when you leave. They make you feel at home. If you come in frequently, They call you by your name. It is a wonderful atmosphere for a burger place. Jared, the manager is wonderful, he is always smiling."}
{"text":"OMG-totally hooked!  Why hadn't I heard about this place?  So happy it's in my hood.  Had the avocado burger twice last week and a chix w/ goat cheese & cucumber today.  Had both the reg. smashfries and the sweet potato...can't decide which I like better.

Went back after a burger experience last week to get the Haagen Daz shake I did not partake of earlier in the day.  Ridiculous.

Place is very clean, service is pleasant and I will be a regular pending new stretch jeans ;-)  Anything this good has to be bad for you...right?

Enjoy!

{"text":"It's a new location. Quick and friendly service. Parking is a little small but other than that no complaints. Great location."}
{"text":"We had never been here before and when we walked in the staff was rude and unwelcoming.  There were maybe 6 families in the entire restaurant and EVERY table was filthy.  Staff was just standing around talking while we cleared ourselves a table.  This place is a joke and absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"This review is based on 3 separate visits, all dine-in.

Food: I ordered the Carolina, Classic, and Chicago burgers, one for each visit. The burger itself is a bit too greasy, and over-salted.The burger patty is oversized in diameter for the bun, making the burger extremely sloppy and messy to eat. The taste was average, with the Carolina burger being the most interesting and flavorful. The fries were interesting and moderately tasty, but not extraordinary. 

Price: The price was somewhat higher than the direct competition, and overpriced for the quality of the food. 

Cleanliness: The restaurant was relatively clean, although finding a clean table was a challenge on all three visits. The place is brightly colored and lit,with a slight retro 50's psuedo-west coast vibe.

Service: Service is, for want of a better word, terrible. The level of apathy displayed by the employees (including the managers) approaches the level of t.v. sitcom cliche. It's so pervasive they should just incorporate it into the smashburger theme. The service was bad on all 3 visits.

Overall: I was excited to have another burger joint in Ballantyne, but overall Smashburger is a disappointment. The price is too high for average food with poor service. There are 2 Five Guys in the area, I would definitely recommend them over Smashburger; they have a better product, cleaner restaurant, lower prices, and employee who at least pretend to care."}
{"text":"Good burgers but too expensive for what they are. All smash burgers tend to be slow. One cashier is not enough for peak times. I have now been waiting 20 minutes for my order of 2 burger. The cheap ass owner of this place get more people working in here"}
{"text":"We ordered to go.  The restaurant was about half full and the wait for our food did seem a little long, but I'm always happy to wait if the food is good and you can see that the staff is all working hard.  I probably wouldn't go here if you are on a tight lunch schedule.

The decor is modern.  It's okay.  It is a step up from McDonald's but definitely a step down from Delux or Zinburger, which are just down the street.

Our burgers were good.  I felt like mine was a little under-cooked.  I think that it would be advantageous for them to cook their burgers to order.  The price is high enough and the wait is long enough that it should be made to order.  

All-in-all, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Love Smash. One of my favourite places to go for my luck break. The BBQ Bacon & cheddar is a killer burger paired with sweet potato fries. The line up can be a bit long especially during lunch rush, but the wait is definitely worth it. They bring the food right to your table and clean up after too. Honestly i feel kind of bad not picking up after myself but it's a great feature to the establishment. Quick service, good food decent prices. What else could you ask for in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Bomb bbq bacon burger. Applewood smoked bacon cooked perfectly and smash sauce complemented the smashfries! Next time I will definetly try a milkshake. Plus all the workers were super nice."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went to try it out as I was given $25 of gift certificates from a manager I helped out. The guy (Raul) on the cash register was extremely helpful and very personable which was a nice start. Good selection of burgers. Sin City Burger is pretty awesome!! Nice selection of fries too. We will be returning some time in the near future. Unfortunately we will be paying next time, but it will definitely be worth it...You won't be disappointed. THANKS SMASHBURGER!!"}
{"text":"Stopped at the drive thru location on my way home today. Never been here before and my buddy at work said it was one of the best burgers he ever had. I would disagree. I ordered a number 1 combo \"big\" and a number 3 combo \"big\" no clue what big means here, the kid in the drive thru was not very friendly and the burgers are just mediocre at best. For 24 dollars for two combos I would think a \"big combo would come with a large drink. I'm glad this is Vegas and there are so many more places to spend 24 dollars on lunch. That's my first and my last trip to smash burger.... ( the kid at the drive thru was sighing on the microphone every time I said hang on cus I was trying to decide what to eat( seeing how I'd never been to this joint before)
Definitely not going to donate money here anymore"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service!! 3 of us went in and ordered, 2 of us got food and 1 didn't. The smash fries I had literally had just oil on them, we took them back and asked about the burger. The counter girl was extremely rude about everything and kept rolling her eyes and shaking her head. She brought the burger over and said it was because they were waiting on fries pickles but the table behind us who ordered 10 minutes after us got their food including fried pickles. Well the burger they brought was wrong and we sent it back yet again. The entire time we can hear the girl talking shit, we asked to see the manager who came over and us excuse after excuse. My friend got a little loud and cussed and THE MANAGER came over and told him to \"stop fucking cussing and to calm the fuck down\" and then when we told her she's cussing she said \"I don't give a shit, it's my last day\". We come here quite often and to receive such horrible service is ridiculous. We were also told there is no difference between the big burger and regular except for the price. I will not return to this location, and I highly suggest finding a new location unless you want to be treated like shit from the get go."}
{"text":"Burger was great and served fast. I like the fries and Choco shakes as well.
The only thing was they didn't have change in the drawer so I had to use my debit.
But otherwise it's very clean and staffs very helpful I will be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible rude service!  Cashier is ridiculously rude, walks away to complain that we don't know what we want to order the second we walk through the door. First and last visit to this location!!"}
{"text":"eh!
I was all hyped up and ...its just a burger
a little pricey for just a burger"}
{"text":"After our disappointment at the over hyped In-n-Out, there was another burger joint that I wanted to try since we're in the west coast. Hopefully this place would make up for the other day's burger...

Sister and I ordered the Sin city smash burger 1/3 pound and it was not bad! It's on the salty side, though. If the burger didn't have any bacon on it, then it would be perfect. It is not your clean, petite, cute burger. It's greasy, artery clogging, and bold junk for your tummy.

The fries were pretty solid, waaay better than In-n-Out's, whose fries reminds me of eating styro foam. It has a flavorless and weird texture IMO. 

The fried pickles from here are not special and we could've done without. They were not crispy, barely battered and rather pickly (you know, sour and pickled lol). 

All in all, I was satisfied after devouring the helluva burger from here. Satisfied, but guilty. I might need to run 5 miles to jump start my digestion, though. Prior to entering this place, I joked with my sister and said, \"I hope this place doesn't make us take one\".. (....you know, ...a smash? ha-ha) and it didn't! I know, I'm gross.

BTW, one reviewer mentioned that you have to clean up after yourself? I asked the cashier just to be sure and was told to leave my trays where they were."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Every time is the same, horrible service. Cashier acted like she didn't want to be there and got my order wrong. Got all the way home to find out the fries and burger I ordered was wrong. Pretty frustrating when you spend about 12 dollars for a meal (without a drink) and it's not even the correct order. I would have been better off going to McDonald's across the street if I wanted my order wrong, horrible service and mediocre food (but at least it would be cheaper). Never going back."}
{"text":"Pricey, but so so yummy! Try the Sin City Burger-it's got fried egg and bacon-how can you go wrong with that? I also love their sweet potato fries-hubby gets their fried pickles. Expensive to feed the whole family there, though."}
{"text":"For a place with burger in their name this was a major disappointment. It was a small burger with a decent bun that was way overpriced. I would grab a Whopper before I would return here."}
{"text":"Had the combo with their Arizona burger, regular fries and regular drink. I really liked the taste and combination on the burger. Ate it with the veggie patty. 

Tasty food, friendly service, clean restaurant. At the 9th st location, be careful . You have to immediately turn right from the entrance to join the line for placing your order. They have hard copies of the menu stacked on the walk there to help customers. Else there is a huge screen above the counter. 

We plan to go back."}
{"text":"I just had the worst experience at this place . I was 3 people back in the line at it took 20 minutes to reach the register to pick up my now ice cold burgers and fries. No urgency by the teenage staff and no concern over my wait and experience. The food is no better than any fast food burger place but a lot more money. If you want a fast food burger , go to In And Out. Skip the bad service and cold food at Smashburger."}
{"text":"SMASH Burger is different from a traditional Fast Food Franchise because the serve alcohol. As far as the food, I was more excited about what toppings to add on my Burger than the taste. The meat is Dry not Juicy. (HINT: SMASH Burger) So if you like a fully cooked Burger this is the place. Also you wont go wrong by ordering their Shakes."}
{"text":"So this was my first time having a Smash burger and man do I have to say that I freakin loved it!!!! The flavor that explodes in your mouth is absolutely amazing!!! I ordered the Arizona and what a nice spice kick to it and very flavorful!!! I also order the sweet potato fries and they were ok nothing ridiculously good. After all set and done I got the bill and realized its $9.02 with tax, kinda was thinking to my self did I just really spend that much on a burger with some fries? Yes I apparently did haha.

I wish they were cheaper lets say $5.99 + tax = ( 3/4lb burger + fries ) would be nice.  ARE YOU READING THIS SMASH???

Any way I was impressed so impressed I ended up going back a second time two nights in a row, got the original and that was flavorful too!!!!

Thanks again SMASH!!!!
Ciao, Luca"}
{"text":"I really want to give a good review . I'll start with the good stuff. It's clean, fast and friendly...But wow is the food beyond TOO SALTY! I know smash burger is more salty and flavored than your average place but this was so salty I couldn't finish. I don't know if it's pre salted but every item and ingredient was overbearing."}
{"text":"The burgers are overly greasy which is totally gross, but they are so good with fried pickles, it can not be denied.  I always get the Vegas burger with pickles."}
{"text":"I really hoped this place would be better.

My biggest gripe is the food--everything else I can forgive. All burgers are served the same temp (well), which means the meat is frozen. For the price, I would expect more. That said, my mushroom swiss burger was good. The AZ smashburger had too much going on--a lot of conflicting flavors that didn't make a cohesive burger. 

Fries: Smashfries: yum. Veg Frites: pass. They truly are still vegetables and taste like it. 

Okay, and all the rest...

Service: an inefficient model. None of the workers seemed to have assigned posts, and milled around aimlessly. This probably caused the dirty seats. Milkshake delivery was similarly inefficient, tying up the people assigned to the cashier's desk until they finished blending the shakes. I would fix this, especially for busy high-peak times. 

Practical advice: bring a sweater! there was quite a wind-tunnel in the place."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers chicken sandwiches and milk shakes. The fries are the BEST I have ever eaten; they're crispy shoestring tossed in a light olive oil with fresh thyme and rosemary, you don't need ketsup or salt."}
{"text":"Yuck!  My chicken looked liked someone had spent some serious energy pounding it. Gives a new meaning to \"smash\" burger lol. Thin and salty,  why couldn't they just hef out the extra and give you a real chicken breast? There are so many places out there for a good burger you can just skip this one. 

Plus the atmosphere is very food court like."}
{"text":"I brought my cousin in her girlfriend here for the first time a few days ago. I ordered the Frank's hot chicken sandwich it was absolutely amazing! !! The fries could have been better, I think there a little to thin. Overall Great oreo peanut butter milk shake my cousin had she loved it. Customer service was great. Not to mention we also got coupons. We definitely will be returning.  Keep up the good work ladies."}
{"text":"Bad service they forgot my order and didn't bring me my food also not worth the price and the burger was really just a burger"}
{"text":"Went to the Sahara and Fort Apache location...husband and son loved it, but being a vegetarian, not much there for me...order essentially a grilled cheese sandwich with avocado and got a bun with 1 slice of cheese and 1 slice of avocado, but paid just the same as if I had meat on the sandwich...the verdict is still out..."}
{"text":"THE most Awesome Burger I have ever had at a restaurant! If you are not Starving then don't order the Big size...its huge...but oh so juicy and delicious. Thank goodness they provide a big stack of napkins at your table because you will need them. One order of fries is plenty for two people too.

The restaurant was bright, clean, and packed! The service was great...very friendly people. And the food came to our table fast!

We will definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"This is a glorified fast food burger place. Lots of kids and noise. The burger was fresh and the roll was good .only that there was more bread than burger on the regular size.  The Cobb Salad with chicken was good.  No ambience for an ok $10+ burger."}
{"text":"I really liked Smashburger! I had the black bean burger. Soooo good. The fries were pretty so and so, but the fried pickles were very tasty:). They workers were all super nice and very fast! I love love love the black bean burger! The place was also very clean and organized which I like. Another bonus is the dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"Very clean and awesome service! Burgers are so tasty. Good place for kids. Great shakes. I highly recommend coming here if you are looking for a great burger."}
{"text":"Ok I don't understand why this place is rated so high. Honestly In & Out tastes much better than this place and way cheaper. Thank goodness we had a groupon. We heard people ranting and raving about this place and in the words of Shania Twain \"that don't impress me much.\"

My friend ordered the traditional All-American cheeseburger, smashfries and vanilla milkshake. I tried her fries and booo no flavor, which was a shame since they were sprinkled with Rosemary & garlic (I couldn't taste either).

I ordered the SinCity burger since it sounded like the best burger on the menu plus many stated this was the best burger. Was it? Uh negative, I personally thought it was too salty and dry. The egg was overcooked and the bacon was eh ok. It was topped with haystraw onion rings and grilled onions so onion overload indeed. Presentation was wonderful but the taste was less gratifying. Even the sweet potato smashfries had no flavor even with the rosemary and garlic that was on them. Perhaps sprinkle some of that secret smash seasoning on the fries and you might move up a star.

BTW the fried pickles were super salty, if you like fried pickles just stick to Hooters.

Overall this place is busy and had a line the whole time we were there. My friend and I couldn't understand what was so great about this place. Yes the cashiers and servers were friendly but they couldn't compensate for the quality of the food. If I want a $5.99 burger plus $1.99 for fries might as well go to Red Robin or just stick to In & Out. If you're a sodium junkie this is your place to be!"}
{"text":"Can't say anything about the food. The clerk was too busy counting and recounting the change in her drawer to take our order. So after 10 minutes we left since the manager also asked us to \"just wait a few minutes\". Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and the restaurant looked like a pig pen while the red haired gal and dark haired gal lounged around leaned up against the wall drinking soda!  The service was sooooo slow and the cooks had a different radio blasting in the back.  The Manager of this place needs to clean house, people and facility!!  I waited 20 minutes for a kids hamburger and I was 1 of 3 in the store!  While waiting I saw the dark haired girl try ridiculously to shove a box into a cabinet for which the box clearly was too big to fit, but she came close to breaking the door off to try!  I thought I was at the circus!  This place needs serious help!  I won't be back for a while!"}
{"text":"I was excited about this place, as it served beer with your burger and felt like a high quality fast food place. The burger tasted good, but the price was more then I'd like to spend on a...well...average burger. The beer was decent, but I think I'd rather go someplace else than come back. Not a bad stop if you don't mind a little extra price for just a decent burger, but honestly, I've had better burger at Culvers for a better price. 

I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Based purely on having only milkshakes and fried pickles...

Fried pickles are WAY too salty. And I love salty food. 

Milkshakes were pretty good. Chocolate malt better than butterfinger."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Our bill was $26.00 for one 1/2 # burger and a chicken sandwich with 2 small fries and one soft drink... Order bacon you get a 1/2 a strip broke in half again. Ordered extra chese never got it, had to take both sandwiches back up because they did not put it on. Never again. 

 If you want an awesome burger stay at home or try Fat Burger...."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town, Hands down... The fries are so so so good. I like this location the best... Everytime I've gone here it's been amazing service"}
{"text":"Really good, My Co-Workers and I order there for lunch. Food is ready quick"}
{"text":"My new favorite burger place, and it's only a few minutes away from the house! Bonus!  I really love the Sin City burger (minus the grilled onions) and the chicken sandwiches are great too! I love avocado on chicken sandwiches. Egg on a burger is now a must, thanks to Smashburger.  The fries here are just okay, so I usually stick with a burger.  The staff is friendly and bring your order out promptly.  They also have a build your own menu, and a good kids menu...great for the entire family!  High recommend stopping by here."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, the price is scary, was a good try but not sure if the money is worth it. I would say you need to try at least once, if you feel like spending a little bit of money on a burger it is worth it! 
The food was awesome staff was friendly, the only reason for the low mark is the price $10 just seems like a lot for a burger...."}
{"text":"Got the Spicy Burger and a fry, no drink.  Total was $9.60.  The burger was ok, but for that price it should have been fantastic.  The fries were underdone.  I like mine crispy.  Since Create closed I figured I should give this place a try.  I will not be back.

Wow that was a little harsh. I have been back, many times. Even though it's a little pricey it is quality. Love the fried pickles. Seems less busy too. Hope it's doing well."}
{"text":"Great place to relax & eat.. Burgers are amazing , building up your own burger with all the toppings you want plus so many different kinds of f"}
{"text":"The staff here were very friendly. However, what impressed me was the alternative choices on the menu. I found that black bean vegetarian burgers were available and that potato-based french fries could be substituted with green bean and carrots fries. It may cost a little more to eat healthier, but I think it's worth it. Now that I see this is not a typical burger joint, I think I may eat here more often."}
{"text":"Loved the Olive Oil Fries! Didn't Love The Dirty Tables.

I decided to try Smash Burger after a friends recommendation. I LOVED the olive oil fries, and the veggies with the ranch sauce. The burger was pretty good, too, but my bun got squishy and soggy way too fast. I did like the fact that we could eat outside. The guy taking my order was a total sweetheart. The girl that brought the food was also very nice. They seem to be a bit understaffed, though, as there were a LOT of dirty tables inside and outside of the establishment and the trash cans were filled to the max. Hopefully they can get better staffed to keep the place clean."}

{"text":"My favorite is the grilled chicken avocado! They do have good burgers here. No 5 stars because they are a little overpriced. For a burger with smash fries and a drink combo is about $13 for one person unless you have a coupon. And if you do get the chicken burger, don't order the fried patty. Mine was way overcooked. Other than that, it's a great burger joint!"}
{"text":"This place a has a really good burger and great fried pickles. I love how you can choose the size of your burger, but sometimes the bread overwhelms the patty when you order a smaller burger."}
{"text":"Friendly service? Absolutely yes! Unique packaging? Sure.  Good food? Meh -not extraordinary.  Economical pricing? Absolutely not.

Why would a $7 burger/sandwich NOT include fries? And since when did a shake cost $4?  To their credit they also gave us the leftovers.  But the $50 bill was a surprise and disappointment.

If you have a family of 5, including teenagers, go somewhere that sells baskets/combos.  If you're 1 or 2 eaters, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Above average burger, but over priced compared to the other burger places in the Valley. I ordered the Classic Smash with the haystack onion rings. They put the smash sauce on the side, which is good, since I really didn't care for it too much. The onion rings were thinly cut, but a tad to greasy. 
If you plan on going a lot, sign up for the Smash club and they'll send you coupons for a free side."}
{"text":"Wow!  Let me start by saying I love a good juicy burger, it ranks as one of my favorite foods.  As simple as it sounds it is hard to find a great one so I usually make my own if the mood strikes.  After a disappointing experience at the new 5 Guys, I was a little hesitant to try Smashburger.   No worries, this burger is near perfect.  Full of flavor, great bun, nice toppings and you could tell the cook did not commit the cardinal sin of leaning on the burger during cooking and losing all the wonderful juice.  Fries were also good, thin and crispy.  Price was maybe just a tad high but you get what you pay for and I'll pay an extra dollar or two for the quality.  Only small complaint was it was just a little salty so if you don't like salt tell them to skip it.  Overall one of the best ever."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this location today and the customer service by the two young men working was EXCELLENT!

We had our order taken immediately when we walked in. When we went to sit down, our table was a little dirty so I asked if I could grab a rag and wipe it down. One of the young men ran over immediately and wiped it down for us and offered to bring extra napkins. He apologized for the table, as they were understaffed. I know what it is like to work at a place that is understaffed, so I told him no problem and we would be patient.

Our food came out within minutes, and the other young man offered to get us a knife and forks, which we needed. I asked for a side of mayo and ranch, normally every other Smashburger location brings me out one small pack of mayo, this young man brought out an actual side for us. Later, he checked on us to make sure everything was going well, which it was.

They greeted everyone that walked in the door, and said goodbye to every customer that left. The two young men were working hard and showed great customer service to us and the rest of the customers in the restaurant. I gave them a couple of extra dollars for their tip before we left and thanked them for the great experience there.

I know the points I touched on seem small but they really made our experience there the best that I have had at a Smashburger. These two young men deserve recognition for their wonderful work ethic."}
{"text":"Damn you cheeseburgers and how good you taste, I would be a healthier person if this deliciousness were never invented.  At least at Smashburger I have the option to negate the damage that I may be doing to my health when I eat their awesome, juicy, tasty cheeseburger by ordering their mixed-vegetable side instead of their fries.  

Don't get me wrong, the fries are good.  I haven't tried the Smash Fries yet, but given the great flavor of everything else that I've eaten at Smashburger, I would imagine that those seasoned fries are damned good too.  Nevertheless, opting for the asparagus/ string beans/ carrots mixture is a good way to fool yourself into believing that you are eating a light and healthy lunch.

I was also fooled when I saw my Smashburger.  Perhaps the tray that it came on was an optical illusion, but when my 1/3 lb. burger was brought to my table I thought that maybe I didn't order enough food for lunch.  Yet when I was half way through my meal I definitely realized that I had more than enough food to eat.  

Just like many other new fast food restaurant concepts that are popping up all over the place, the food at Smashburger tastes as though it is fresh and of very high quality.  In the same vein, the food definitely tasted as though it was made explicitly for my order and had never seen a warming tray or a microwave.  I only wish that there were more Smashburgers in the Valley because when ASU goes back into session I would imagine that it will be very difficult to grab a quick lunch at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Way way way way way way too noisy. Food is good. They need a bigger space. I might give two stars but the food is good. There must have been sun spots or something. The have salt and pepper on the tables, which was good to see."}
{"text":"Gave it another try & unfortunately I won't be back. 

Ordered the Avocado Club with Chicken. No bacon or ranch. Came out as a Avocado Club with Meat. Don't eat red meat. Had a feeling cashier wasn't listening very well when I ordered. This was confirmed when he handed me the receipt & asked me TWICE what my change was. Wow. 

For $20.70 we got an Avocado Club with a fountain drink, a mushroom swiss burger with smash fries & a bottled root beer. A lil pricey now that I think about it. Nothing special to these 'creations' other than the meat being 'smashed'. No special ingredients or sauces. I can make this at home for a lot cheaper. 

Staff is still awkward. Cleaning with products as people are eating. Also employees eating in dinning room in uniform. No. No. No. 

Ahhh good luck to y'all."}
{"text":"Ok.  So I had heard about SmashBurger for a while, and considering I was in the area, I figured, might as well see what the fuss is about.  After perusing the menu, I decided that the Sin City Smash and some sweet potatoes fries sounded very appealing.  I order, they give me my number and I sit and wait.

Finally, the food had arrived.  Mind you the wait wasn't that bad, 5 minutes maybe, decent time, nothing to mark down on.  I take my bite, and I'm overwhelmed by the onions.  There were 2 types of onions in the burger that it pretty much took over.  I could taste the burger and the egg, but it was well masked by the onions.  The burger was well cooked and very good, and the egg was nice, though a little overcooked.  Altogether an good burger.  The sweet potatoes fries were tossed in olive oil and rosemary (and I think garlic, not sure on that one).  It was very offsetting for the sweet potato fries, though I'm sure it would taste better as the normal SmashFries instead.

All in all, I was kinda let down after all the hype I had been hearing.  I'll probably be back, as it is a better burger than 99% of fast food, but as of now, probably not too often."}
{"text":"They have the worst system for taking orders and filling them. It took 49 minutes for us to get our food from the time we first got into their long and slow-moving line. The orders seemed to come out one burger at a time and in no particular order. Yes, the food was good but no fast food is worth a 49 minute wait.  Next time we will go to In-N-Out next door."}
{"text":"fantastic burgers! my favorite is the baja burger b/c it has jalapenos and avocado! yum! the smash fries are perfect with rosemary seasoning too! if you're a burger fan, this place is for you.
p.s. I can only compare it close to Fuddruckers on the East coast (U.S) so if you love Fuddruckers, this place is 10 notches above Fudds ;)"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: Everyone I've taken here keeps coming back for more.

This place hands down is better than Five Guys and In & Out combined. 

I stumbled upon Smashburger after coming out of the movies and I've been there almost every weekend for a meal since. They have an amazing menu from their signature burgers to building your own, salads, hot dogs, sides (amazing sweet potatoe fries) and shakes, even BEER! 

I promise no one will b disappointed."}
{"text":"Smashburger was one of those regional-turned-national fast-casual burger places that I had heard was amazing, so when it moved to Pittsburgh, I was very excited to try it. Unfortunately, I came out of the restaurant underwhelmed. I'd say the burger was better than a fast-food burger, but not as good as Five Guys. (I suppose the price is somewhere in between too.) It wasn't a burger that I'd think was so amazing that this place deserves to be a nationally expanding chain. They messed up two of the orders out of the six in our party, one came with onions we never asked for, the other was missing the avocado that was requested. It seems as though the toppings were not large enough to cover the extra-wide smashed patties. (The bacon seemed like 3/4 of a slice split in two, avocado was two thinly sliced pieces.) The veggie burger did not look appetizing and tasted a bit too much like just black beans mashed together in a patty. You wouldn't think a chicken burger could be smashed, but somehow they made it very thin. I'm told it tasted good, though maybe it was a bit too thin.

The potato fries were tasty, shoestring fries. They weren't bad, but they tend to get cold quickly. I don't think the smash fries were worth the upcharge- just more oily, garlicky shoestring fries.The sweet potato fries were tasty. Some people like to put too much salt on sweet potato fries, but theirs were not too salty. 

The shakes were both delicious. One of the people got an extra half a metal cup worth of shake, which makes the almost-$5 shake somewhat more worth it. However, the second person who ordered a shake got nothing extra, just the moderate-sized glass cup. When asking one of the servers, she said yes, they are supposed to come out with the extra half a cup. And then she said \"oh, I guess they didn't have enough extra for yours.\" She did not offer to get us some more, and instead just walked away. A second server who came by asking us if we wanted any \"refills\" (not quite sure what he was offering to refill, as the drink machine was self-serve), also did not offer us any further shake after asking about the metal cup situation.

Overall, the food was good, but not great. Not a place I would want to rush back to solely for their burgers (unlike Five Guys). These 'fast casual'burger places are all creeping up in price anyways, so its getting to the point where you can get a higher quality sit-down-restaurant burger like at Max and Erma's for less than one of these. The shakes were the only really tasty things here, but they weren't cheap. The service was quick, but inaccurate and inconsistent."}
{"text":"I love this place when I'm craving a burger.  My favorite is the Arizona with extra jalapeño  . Fresh, crispy, tangy jalapeño. Add to that the fried pickles served with ranch and you have the foundation for any food pyramid.  The service is always good even when busy, but there may be a line.  Someone on Yelp said something about price; yea, there's no 99 cent menu if thats what your looking for."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst and over priced burger I have ever had.  $25 for 2 burgers with fries and a coke.

I knew I should have just gone to In and Out across the street.  At least at In and Out you get 2 of the best burgers anywhere with fries and a drink for $15."}
{"text":"Saturday, May 21, lunchtime; worst onion rings ever, so_so burger, unhappy workers! Corporate image being destroyed. Needs oversight, I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"A solid four stars. I'd put this restaurant in the category of upscale, family-friendly, casual, quick dining.  You order at the counter, and they bring the food to your table (they are licensed as well).  The burgers and chicken are large and thin, cooked on a buttered grill for great flavor.  An array of free and paid toppings are available, as we'll as a better-than-expected list of sides.  I was surprisingly smitten with the spinach and feta, and love the egg bread bun. They also have a decent black bean patty, so you can take your veggie friends there and not feel awkward.  Although this is a U.S. chain, they have made thoughtful efforts to include Canadian items, such as poutine, Montreal steak spice, and domestic beers.  Their U.S. roots show in the iced tea offerings, which are not the hyperglycemia-inducing concoctions us Canucks are used to.  No matter, you really want the Butterfinger milkshake anyways [insert sound of drooling here]."}
{"text":"I went there again last Thursday for a quick lunch before my afternoon meetings. The food was served very fast and I love their sweet potato fries, very yummy.  I've tried them a few times in their different locations, but I think the one in Camelback tastes better than the one in Tempe Marketplace.  Would love to try it again sometime :)  I am actually not a big fan for burgers anymore after I moved to the US from China, but I do like their sides and feel a bit healthier than a big burger!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! First time for my husband and I, we both loved the burgers!! They have some awesome shakes and malts too  we'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Not a bad quick-dining option if you're in the Stonecrest area.  The food is consistently good, but never really memorable.  I would define the quality of the grub as being stuck somewhere between a fast food burger chain and a Bad Daddy's or Cowfish, more along the lines of Five Guys (just not as good).

Service is soild - you order at the counter, take a number, and then your food is brought out to your table.  The management team has done a good job of balancing speed with the quality of service and the quality of the food.

We frequent the establishment mostly because we have small kids who eat anything deep fried, dripping in cheese, or made with ice cream.  They love it here.  The fountain, stairs, and live music in the outdoor space between Smashburger and the other restaurants/shops right there make for a perfect spot to let kids run around and burn off some of their chocolate shake calories without disturbing other patrons."}
{"text":"The Boss(bf) and I decided to head on an adventure to try Smash Burger. We have been to the Fat Burger on 32 st many times prior and I honestly was more interested in trying something new that day. We took the 73 from my house which was the easiest way to get there considering I was located in the N.E. at the time. 

Inside the place was loaded with people on a Saturday afternoon. There was no shortage of ways to read the menu, as it was posted at the door, on the counter, and up above the till. The restaurant interior had been created with the open concept industrial feel that's really in right now. And I loved the white tables and chairs, which gave the place a really bright environment. We ordered up, and took a seat at the back corner near the washrooms which kind of gave us our own little space, besides the elderly couple that had seated beside us. 

I went with the BBQ bacon and cheddar smashburger, as I enjoy keeping things simple, and the Boss ordered the Mushroom Swiss. I also went with a side of Sweet potato Smashfries because I liked the idea of the deep-fried yam goodness being treated like roasted potatoes with the rosemary and garlic.

I loved, the smash effect, made it easier for me to eat without feeling like a huge slob. Also how they play up the Smash effect, which you can read at your table, put a smile to every bite as I thought about the guy in the back creating every burger like some kind of Burger Artiste extraordinaire. 

One thing I took note of was the Caesar salad comes with spinach, something I wouldn't have known about if the Elderly lady wasn't complaining about her salad being incorrect only to have a helpfull waitstaff explain to her that it's how it's made. The waitstaff are attentive and clear tables, answer questions and bring your food to you. They also handle complaints from customers very well, which was apparent with all the lady's concerns.

In conclusion, I will definitely eat there again, as the experience was very pleasant. The burger was delicious."}
{"text":"Prices are fair. It WREAKED of sewage outside on the patio area. So we sat inside.  I ordered the BBQ chicken and my fella ordered the BBQ burger.  Both arrived with virtually NO bbq sauce. I requested some twice from our server until I walked up to get my own at the checkout area.
Also, \"flash frying\" perfectly delicious veggies simply to have them delivered to my table dripping in oil and flavored in lonely salts was a waste of a few bucks.

Step it up"}
{"text":"I've been to several Smashburgers before and the food is always good. This location has not satisfied the most basic components of being a rapid dining establishment. As I write this I am now 25 minutes into waiting for my order, my wife sits furious in the car with a trunk full of groceries and we are now nearly a half hour behind on our plans for the day. There are two people working the entire front of the restaurant. I'm not sure if someone called out sick or if this is normal for them. Having two people to order assemble/run, bus tables, and take orders is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in an average traffic restaurant. I am not happy and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food great service.  Thanks Tyrell!  Glad to see the kids meal is still a great value and the bacon avocado club was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"The food was ok but the customer service was terrible. When we ordered she seemed irritated to add a shake to our order; are you kidding me, it's a freaking shake and a button away. Then the people behind us got all of their orders including their shake before we did and when I asked the girl at the front where my shake was, she said they were making it. Literally 20 minutes later the girl came out with my shake and walked right past my table and looked outside and finally actually looked and found my tall number on my table. This place is full of nothing but rude and ditzy people. Will NOT be returning to smash burger."}
{"text":"Love the food! I usually create my own \"Smash\" Burger and I get the Smash Fries, which is a MUST! They're amazing! LOL. The service is always nice and the food comes out pretty quick. The shakes are good but over priced for a small amount. The restaurant part could be cleaner, but I'm hooked and love coming to this place!"}
{"text":"I tried Smashburger after hearing great things from a coworker.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the volume of ambient noise; It's very loud. The second was the prices on the menu.

I had a 1/3lb Spicy Baja burger, Smashfries, and a drink, coming to about $11.  The burger was very tasty; Not the best burger I've ever eaten, but rather enjoyable.  The fries didn't reach my expectations; they were very oily, and I ended up leaving half of them on the plate.  While the food was decent, it wasn't worth $10 to me.  I'll probably eat there again, but not soon or often."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burger.  It wasn't overcooked like a fast food burger.  The shake was great!  It was made with real ice cream.  Everyone says their shakes are made with real ice cream but most of the time it doesn' taste like.  This was legit.  Try the salted caramel shake.  
4 Stars vs. 5 because I had the bacon cheeseburger and there was very little bacon.  Also, they brought us the wrong fries."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it is always inconsistent . The Burgers are pretty tasty but they are super greasy. The fries are good when there hot...."}
{"text":"The Smashfries are perfect shoestring fries. Lightly seasoned and best without ketchup (as is the case with most things). Tried the bacon cheeseburger and liked it a lot. Bun was a little too soft for me, but ingredients were solid."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my burger. It's 5.99 for just the burger and it was made pretty poorly. The atmosphere there is pretty laid back but if your looking for a meal I don't recommend going here. Instead, you can go to a place like in n out burger and get a whole meal for the same price."}
{"text":"We were welcomed and explained a bit about their food. The manager was very helpful in deciding as we haven't been here before. We were unsure if our toddler would like the sweet potatoe fries and when they brought our food out the manager had also given us a side of regular fries and deep fried veggies on the house to ensure our son had more choices :) We had a pleasant experience and the food was fast and delicious"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, but every since I became a vegetarian a year ago the appeal of smashburger has unfortunately waned. When I have an inkling to stop by, I have to get the bean burger or a salad. I refuse to get salads at any restaurant, so I go for the bean burger.  The burger itself is... Ummm... Well, it sucks. It is very dry and unappealing so I have to dress it up through the build your own menu. I regrettably have to say that I will not be frequent to smashburger anymore and this makes me sad. I just don't live the meat eaters lifestyle anymore =(

The staff at this location are ALWAYS sweet and accommodating! Customer service is 5 stars on its own. They are almost too sweet. I get a little suspicious sometimes, because it's rare to get such pleasant service the moment you step inside to the time you leave. 

I will miss them but after tonight's dinner I realized the bean burger isn't going to cut it for me to continue being a customer. The smash fries are not what they used to be either. Too much oil and over-frying of the fries.

But to you meat-eaters, this location in particular is the best! Its clean, inviting, and customer service is 5 star! Smash fries are usually good, but I've had a couple disappointing batches. I still think the food is good enough (if you're not a vegetarian) to warrant a visit to this location, so definitely stop by!

As for me it. I have to say good bye my sweet smashburger! I'll miss you very much, but I can't eat one more bean burger. It's just not good without a crap ton of dressing and condiments, which only then makes it edible. Try introducing the garden burger instead or maybe a different spin on the beans so they aren't so dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken sandwich with gluten free bun and veggie frite + sweet potatoe fries!! Love this food!! Yummy milkshakes too!!"}
{"text":"Really really good food toped off with really really good shakes and the best service at a fast food restaurant you will ever see."}
{"text":"First time being here. Really loved the burgers.  Reminded me of my dad's. Delicious. My shake also came out well. We enjoyed the options and server very helpful!!"}
{"text":"I normally love this place.. Lately service has been poor; my daughter and I came in and 800 and we we ignored as they were putting up the chairs.  They saw us but continued cleaning acting as though they were closed- we went to Chipotle"}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new Smashburger today, as I've only been to the one on college (just once, parking is too annoying). 

The restaurant was clean, and there was plenty of seating from what I could tell, I didn't look too hard though. I'd probably guess enough for maybe 30-50 people? 

That staff seemed very friendly, and willing to accommodate. 

For the food, I had the Big (1/2 lb) Arizona Smashburger with a side of smash fries (fries with oil, rosemary, and garlic). With the burger it had a good char, and you could tell it was made fresh and not just pre-packed patty (just by the shaping of it). the meat itself didn't taste too overly seasoned, and yes you could taste it was actually meat. I quite liked the toppings, They put plenty of guacamole on it, and felt the amount of lettuce/tomato/onion was just right (for me its where you know it is there, but it isn't so prevalent you notice it the whole time). It is somewhat greasy, thankfully they give you napkins. 

The fries are alright, I'm not running out to go get more but I wouldn't avoid getting them either when I go. They are salty, at least to me (and I can tolerate a fair bit of salt), so be forewarned. I don't notice. The rosemary is a strong flavor you will notice right away. They don't seem to oily which is a plus. 

Overall I liked it, it didn't blow me away (as most burger joints don't) but I would recommend it if you aren't on a budget. It was basically $10 for my order, so like I said if you are on a budget, it is probably better to hit up an In N Out or Habit instead (best of the cheap places). If you are willing to spend a bit more, I don't think you'll do wrong with heading over to Smashburger."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today.....Wonderful!

I didn't understand the seating at first but I went in through a side door instead of the front.  You will understand when you get in.  I love that they have monus everywhere.  Everything is simplfied yet elegant at the same time.  They even have 2 different size patties!  We came in late during a full moon....apparently everyone was starving for Smash Burger tonight because they ran out of 1/2 burger patties!  I ordered sweet potato fries and they were great.  My favorite thing was the customizable burger I created for myself.  I felt like there were no boundaries.  All in all, for those of us that love burgers.....this is a must try!

I welcome Adam Richman from MAN VS FOOD to try this.  

Go Smash Burger!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the beacon cheese burger, salted caramel shake. Great people and food. Employees are really friendly."}
{"text":"This place is always awesome. Love the mushroom Swiss burger. Thanks to Davis Reyes for a great experience !"}
{"text":"Black bean burger was delightful. Love the smash fries! Jared is such an awesome person! First time at this location and I was very satisfied. Super friendly, outgoing, and courteous."}
{"text":"Super salty haystack onions and the petal sauce was gross, burger was dry and salty and way too expensive for fast food."}
{"text":"I recently came to Smashburger for lunch with co-workers, craving a good burger. I will first say that the employees were very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was fairly clean. There were some tables that were not wiped clean and the drink station was a bit unkept. 

The food was ok. I had the larger of the two burger sizes available. In my opinion, it wasn't that big of a difference. The flavor of the burger itself was just ok. I like that the burger was cooked on a skillet top, to seal in flavor, but it was negated by being slightly over cooked. Oh yeah, almost forgot, as they did, I didn't receive the style of burger I had ordered, but wasn't on the mood to say anything, so I ate what I was given. 

I can't say I won't be back, but I won't make Smashbuger my first choice or referral either."}
{"text":"I must admit that Smashburger has become one of my favorite burgers. This location is VERY small as it is inside of the Fiesta and mainly services hotel guests and carryout order. Delicious nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers.  Fries are good.  Shakes are pricey but great flavor.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My friends and I tired Smashburger for the first time earlier today and my experience was okay. As soon as we walked inside it felt warm and humid inside, not sure if the A/C was on or not. It didn't really bothering me too much considering how packed it was inside. 
I ordered the Avocado club with french fries and a regular drink. My total came out to $11 and some change, which was little pricey for a fast food burger joint. My burger tasted pretty good, the patty was moist, made with real bacon, and the vegetables on the burger seemed fresh. 
The only problem was my friends ordered got messed up and we overheard the table next to us explaining to the server that their order got messed up as well. Overall the service was great, our server Joy was very friendly and food was decent."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are pretty good, but the service is rather indifferent keeping from frequenting this location more often. A smile and some attempt to differentiate themselves from a fast food restaurant would be nice. I've never had the shakes but I've heard good things."}
{"text":"Great staff! Pleasant. Clean and new place too! I'm in love with their sweet potato fries and their onion rings! Great burgers too! Just had the Arizona chicken, I had it without jalapeños... And it was still good and spicy. Pretty sure with them would of been too much fire."}
{"text":"Excellent service cant be taught. Received some of the best customer service since I've been in Vegas. Jake is a super nice guy and looks like he enjoys what he does! I'm not from the area but the next time I'm here,I'll be sure to stop by here. And the burger.......OH LAWD!!! Absolute delicious! Burger was well cooked and still juicy! Fries were pretty good as well. And the shakes!!!! Wheeeeeeeww!! As said by Terry Crews in The Longest Yard, \"I got the shakes that'll make you quake!!!\". No joke, these shakes are another reason to visit here lol. Everyone should try at least once....or twice...ok 3 times!!
Get yo smash on!!"}
{"text":"Best burger and fries in town, try the classic smash and classic fries!   Lots of toppings, yet not greasy and the bun doesn't fall apart.

Also, best salad in town is the classic cobb with crispy chicken and chipotle dressing.

Add a shake to top it off."}
{"text":"Today is my first visit to Smashburger. I read a really honest review giving it 4 stars. I don't usually give much weight to 5 star reviews unless their description really backs up the stars which they seldom do. The review liked everything except it was a little too salty and had limp lettuce but she still liked it. 

I have to agree the burger was good, not salty or limp lettuce and very hot. Great employees. So why do I only give it 4 stars?  Well I love all types of burgers. This burger was somewhere between a fast food type burger and a Resturant, bar and grill, type burger. The Fry's were thin and crisp. Now in order for this type of burger to get 5 stars from me it needs to be as good or better than a Chili's old fashioned burger. It is not that good but a good burger none the less. The Fry's need to be as good or better than 5Guys Burger and Fry's. Again not quite that good although the olive oil and herbs are a really nice touch but the under lying hot Fry's came up just a touch short. 

Don't get me wrong I will definitely be back. For what it is I had a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Ok for over price burger !! Good ambient and gray decor but burger just won't cut for to be Smachburger ,,, too little condiments .. Nothing fancy and nothing specieL ... five guys probably would be better for your money"}
{"text":"Poor service and missing items from takeout order made this visit a waste of $46. I suppose the fries and burgers might have tasted better had they still been hot when we got them home (only a ten minute drive), but it took me so long to get my food and leave (and I even ordered ahead online and walked in their front door precisely when they told me my order would be ready) that everything was cold. I left this exact information in their online feedback area. hopefully they will take steps to correct the issues."}
{"text":"This was the first place i went when i moved to Las Vegas and I'm glad i found this little gem.  The sweet potato fires are the best I've had anywhere.  I really like the burgers because you can tell they are hand made and not frozen and you can definitely taste the difference!"}
{"text":"I tried the baja burger.  The burger was well seasoned and tasty.  The jalepenos gave it a nice spicy kick.   I didn't care for the sauce I got it on the side, tasted too much like mayo. The burger really didn't need the sauce there was already cheese, jalepenos, avacado, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  Also ordered the skinny fries, which was good. Service was efficient and polite."}
{"text":"I was expecting a fast food type of burger, I was very surprised with the first look and then the first bite was amazing. The Avocado burger is fantastic!  I will be back to try other creations.  The highland heights location is kept nice and clean too."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from a friend of mine, I had to give it a try.  Soooooo glad I did.  Like many others have mentioned, I was pretty impressed by the cleanliness and the nice friendly service.  However is was definitely the Sin City Burger that earned the 5 stars.  Omg, the burger was so juicy and had such a nice char/crunch to it.  The bacon was crispy and the combo of grilled/fried onions took it over the top.  It was one of those that kept getting better and better with each bite.  I'm drooling right now just thinking about it.  I used to be a tried and true In-N-Out fan..........but move over buddy, Smash Burger is king."}
{"text":"Despite seeing lukewarm comments left by some -- decided to give this place a try. Unfortunately, now I can see why . . . 

Hubby ordered the Truffle Mushroom Swiss (Truffle mayo, sautéed crimini mushrooms & Swiss on an egg bun) w/ a side of Smash Fries (their signature fries tossed in Italian olive oil, rosemary & garlic) and seemed to thoroughly enjoy his dinner. I on the other hand ordered the Avocado Club burger (avocado, applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, and tomato on a multi-grain bun); I understand that it's a club so it's essentially a cold sandwich but I think at least the burger patty could be warm/hot or won't that work? I mean, even the bun was cold . . . I will say that the Avocado, lettuce and tomato were fresh!

The burger patties are advertised as certified Angus beef but -- considering how quickly the orders were filled, I suspect many of them must be already cooked and waiting for orders to come in . . . Quick and efficient service."}
{"text":"Fried pickles? amazing.
Burgers come in small sizes? yes!! 

The only bad thing about smashburger is the distance from my house. (Or is this a good thing?)

The menu is pretty large for a burger place. We ordered the classic burger and the BBQ bacon & cheddar burger, with fried pickles and regular french fries. BF really liked the BBQ bacon & cheddar burger, especially because there were no veggies on it! The fried pickles were so good, but next time I'll only order them if I'm eating in the restaurant. By the time I got home they were a bit soggy."}
{"text":"The burgers were good, and the smash fries were tasty.  It was a good meal, but not something to write home to mom about.   I would go back if  in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Seriously, I am not sure what all the fuss is about these Smashburger places.  Much like Mckayla Maroney, I was not impressed.  It's a burger place.  That's it.  They aren't trying to be unique in any area as far as I can tell.  It isn't worth any hype and it isn't worth any wait if there is one.  The night we went this particular location wasn't really clean and actually had run out of some things.

I'd pass by this given all the other choices in the area of this mall."}
{"text":"I have gone here for lunch twice now and really liked it! The first time I got a goat cheese salad with chicken and the second time I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Our food was delivered in less than 10 min. (which is a must when you are on an hour break from work) and the staff was very nice. The atmosphere is nice, casual, and clean and the prices are about average for lunch. The only negative would be that the salad was somewhat small for the price...they just need to add more spring mix or spinach since the toppings were plenty, but the chicken was cooked perfect.  I am very critical when it comes to chicken and it was not veiny or chewy, which is really important since I always worry about chicken being undercooked. The sweet potato fries were also amazing and not too greasy. I have yet to try the burgers (which is weird since this is a burger joint) but I will be sure to update if I do!"}
{"text":"While I generally love this place, my visit today was less than stellar. When I arrived, the restaurant was steady, but not packed. In line there was one person ahead of me, no one behind me. Waiting for to-go orders were 2 small groups (one couple, getting 2 burgers and fries and mom and 3 kids, just getting shakes). The reason I bring this up is that it took a small eternity to get my order.

My first sign of trouble was the mother and her children getting their shakes. The comment I should have queued on was, \"Now kids, are your shakes worth the long wait?\" I brushed that off...they're shakes, they take a while to make 3. My next sign of trouble was a guy holding onto his burger and walking to the counter. Apparently he had ordered a Swiss and mushroom burger, and unfortunately for him, they forgot the mushrooms?? I saw the counter girl speak to the cook and they both seemed to get a laugh out of it. When my order was finally ready, I didn't check it. The only thing I changed was asking for no cheese on the BBQ, bacon, and cheddar burger. When I got home (about 10-15) minutes later, I was disappointed to see that literally the only thing on the Burger was BBQ sauce and bacon. The menu isn't complicated, it's not cheap, and I go there for quality. On top of the burger flop, the fries were about 1/3 full....I can live with that, but really? I tried to call the store, but the phone just rang and rang....so disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this location. The employees are super sweet and attentive and the burgers are awesome. I can't help to stop and eat here every time I drive by it. Lol! I love you Smash burger. You guys keep doing you.. It's working. See you tomorrow. Lol"}
{"text":"Smashchicken in my case.

I'm not a big burger person - in fact have never had one in my life but you know what I have had a lot of? Chicken Sandwiches. And you know who's was the JUICIEST EVER?

Smashburger (aka: Smashchicken).

My B.F.F. had been RAVING about Smashburger for weeks now. She was obsessed with the chicken sandwich and kept telling me about their Veggie sides.

I, however, went with the Onion Haystack which was a delicious pile of thinly sliced onion strings that HIT. THE. SPOT. 

AND I got to build my own which is SO much easier in my book since I am a \"high-maintenance\" diner always asking you to hold this and that. Creating my own = creating the best.

The front counter girl was ADORABLE and super friendly and bubbly. Our food took about 10 minutes to come out and we were \"not allowed\" to clean up after ourselves. So service bumped this place up to a 5=starer.

Also, for all your Vegas Groupon lovers out there....today's featured business is Smashburger, $6 for $12 of some delicious nommin'. I think we bought 3 :)"}
{"text":"My wife took me on a date and went to Smashburger before catching a movie next door. We had  to wait a few minutes to order our burgers and fries. 

The burgers took about 10 minutes to come to our table.

I enjoyed my burger and was pleased with the taste and quality of the burger. The burger bun was good. The most disappointing part of the meal was the fries. The fries didn't have much to them and weren't that good. The sweet potato fries were MUCH better! Next time, I'll order those or maybe try the smash fries.

A very good burger, but would rank behind Zinburger, Lobbys, 5 guys, but ahead of some of the chain places like Red Robin, Fuddruckers or even the Chuckbox.

Staff was friendly and very clean. A worker made a point to come by and take our empty basket.

Serves coke products.

Overall assessment, 3.5!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had in my life!!!

I had the \"BBQ Bacon & Cheddar\" burger Big Smash (large size), and an Add On of a fried egg on the side.  It's Egg bun, hamburger meat, bacon, crusted onion rings and BBQ sauce.

The meat n bacon was so juicy n tender!

Excellent eatery prior to going to the stadium.  

I wish there was a Smashburger in Tucson."}
{"text":"We love this place, its about a block from where we live, and the Arizona Burger is great. I'd steer clear of the smash fries and opt for the regular ones. Great service, super friendly staff and good grub."}
{"text":"Got the sin-city smashburger, was not impressed with it at all.  First of all it was way to salty, I mean, I get it, it's gotten onion straws and bacon, but still, ridiculously salty.  The burger itself was tasty, but was completely overwhelmed by the toppings.  I was also shocked that I could barely taste the bacon on the burger considering how strongly flavored bacon is.  On the whole, for $11 with fries and a drink, I felt like it was overpriced.  I would rather go next door to In-N-Out where I could get something comparable for a bunch less."}
{"text":"I just do not get it. I have been here 2 times and it is an OK burger on a good bun with some fresh toppings with out of the ordinary fixings and sides. I just think I can get a better tasting burger at in-n-out or Red Robin. I do like the veggie frits! 

The interior is great for eating a $ burger. I pass this place for a Culvers butter burger any day! Sorry Smashburger maniacs."}
{"text":"Not my first time eating here, not by a long shot, and I'm always impressed. Friendly service, meals delivered to your table, they check up to see how \"everything is going\", grab your trays when you're done and of course the burgs are awesome. I can see this place doing quite good; between the quality food, reasonable prices and good service it would make sense."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and everything was fabulous.  The black bean burger and smash fries were delicious.  The staff was very friendly and quick.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Waited a week after the grand opening before visiting this highly publicized place. When we were walking in we saw a customer walking IN with a bag of food. This should have been a sign for us. We went in and there were two people in line, one at each register. We proceeded to watch as several different people messed around with the cash registers. After 6 minutes and not a word of explanation from anyone about why we were waiting this long, one of the customers at the register finally had enough and walked out. We decided to follow suit and went to the place a few doors down. When we were leaving with our food, we saw that some of our fellow \"line waiters\" from Smashburger had joined us at the competition. I'll never be back.
My distaste for this place may be clouded by the exceptional service that I normally receive at other fast-casual places. This place just seems to be poorly managed. We should have never been left to stand in line without any explanation for 6 minutes. So many companies come from California with a \"you're lucky to be eating here\" attitude. This place falls into that category. They could take a lesson from In and Out."}
{"text":"The husband and I ate there the other week, Ford waited on us and was quite attentive. I had a regular burger with Swiss and side of fries, the hubs got the works. Everything was very clean and delicious and I have to give them that, considering they were very, very busy. We had been anticipating the opening of this smashburger for awhile, I bet they will do well."}
{"text":"Very tasty freshly prepared burgers. Excellent sweet potato fries. Nice place for lunch right next to the ASU campus."}
{"text":"Never will go back. We ordered our food and my boyfriend got his burger first. By the time he was done eating I finally got mine. We ordered milkshakes and didn't get those until we were finished with our meals. All of our food was cold. The smash fries are gross. Seriously, mcdonalds would have been a lot better."}
{"text":"Love smash burger!! Such yummy food! I go here all of the time and have to say I get the best service especially from Meghan! She is so sweet and efficient even when it is really busy she takes the time to ask me if I need anything and knows my regular order, the delicious chicken sandwich! She is great!!"}
{"text":"I come here atleast once a week and I always get the same order with my girlfriend. The person that usually attends me is Ryan. He has always been spot on with our order and has even memorized what eat. Not to mention he has a nice personality. Smash burger should promote this employee"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are good but I would no recommend getting the chicken fingers from this location. 

The served my chicken at scorching hot, almost at a on fire temperature. The second I bit into it my mouth, lips, and tongue were immediately burnt. It was the most unpleasant feeling on I have ever felt on my teeth. Being a very understand person I thought maybe they just wanted to get the order out fast and I would just let it cool. 

Now it was to the point where the rest of my party was done eating and ready to leave. I decide to check on the chicken once more to see if it was okay to eat. But no. I cut into it and smoke was still coming out quite heavily. 

Maybe they cooked my chicken at the wrong temperature??? All I know is that this experience was so traumatic that I will never order any of their chicken products again"}
{"text":"Staff members Sal and Christie were extremely kind and courteous!  Will come back for sureKeep up the great work"}
{"text":"Omg!! Ate one of the best hamburgers ever the other day here! Their sweet potato fries were bomb!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not good and not worth the prices. I suggest you drive up the street to In-N-Out and save yourself some $$

The burger menu is over hyped and Smashburger doesn't deliver. Please don't use truffle mayo and call the burger a truffle burger. You are not Umami.

The buns here are soggy and gross, and the meat here is tasteless. Don't go here."}
{"text":"This was the Dirtiest place I've ever seem.  The Employees didn't wash their hands. Every table had a mess, the garbage cans were over filled with trash.  The drink machine was all sticky on the counters."}
{"text":"Much better than Five Guys! I love the sweet potato fries as well as the cajun bun. Yummy yummy! The fried pickles are good too. I'd never had these before, but my southern friend was with me and made me try them. So glad she did!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, staff was extremely helpful, and very knowledgeable about gluten free options. Will go back there for certain!"}
{"text":"I ate at smash burger for the first time recently. Thought I would try it because everyone raves about it. I learned very quickly into my first bite that their \"secret special sauce\" has mustard in it... I had mustard so much it almost made me throw up. But after solving my problem and ordering a new burger it was AMAZING. I got the sin city burger which was AMAZING with the fried egg and onion strings. If it wasn't so unhealthy I would eat there more often"}
{"text":"I wanted to try them out since I have read on other sites that they are the \"Chipotle\" of fast food burgers! The food was good and fresh! I really liked the fries. They are better than MacDonald's, Wendy's and other cheap fast food places and it shows in the price and quality of the food! They are not as good as Burgatory, BRGR or WingHart's! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Have to say it again, great burger. They offer a gluten free option for my wife and the mushroom and swiss burger is awesome. I spend too much money here."}
{"text":"The best service! Place is so clean, staff are quick and you can see the teamwork.! Oh, and i love the milkshake"}
{"text":"Burger was over seasoned and fries hard, stale and burnt black. Need improvements on quality and consistency. I remember when they first opened the food was tasty, now I don't know if I will be back again."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Smashburger for a few weeks now & asked my dad if he'd like to go there for lunch yesterday. We arrived shortly after noon & the place was pretty packed. My dad ordered the grilled smashchicken & I ordered the classic smashburger (no onions, tomatoes or ketchup) with smashfries. Dad enjoyed his chicken sandwich, but said they put too much mayo on it. My burger was pretty good, I must say, the smashsauce that came on it was tasty! The fries were yummy & my dad agreed. Total for both meals with drinks was under $20. We would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tasty,  juicy burgers,  and I love their sweet potato fries. 

We came on a busy Saturday in the middle of the lunch rush,  but the line to order moved quickly,  and our food came to the table promptly.  And bonus, our order came exactly as ordered. 

The staff were friendly, and super helpful."}
{"text":"Courteous, attentive, and warm staff. The lobby appeared to be clean and well maintained. Kudos guys, keep up the good work. The triple double burger, however, is a completely different story.  

The triple double in their photo/advertisement looks amazing, so I ordered it. What I got could be described as a hot mess: the buns were soggy, which is surprising because it was supposedly made fresh. The veggies were no longer crisp but succumbed to the heat and moisture lock of the wrapping paper.  The whole thing was smashed together in a soggy glob. Perhaps this is what they mean by SMASHburger. If the company is held to a standard where photos represent the product, well, it isn't even close. I mean not even in the same county close. 

Here's a suggestion. Flame cook the meat so it doesn't retain so much fat (grease), and slightly toast the buns so they resist moisture from grease and moisture from the veggies. Add the cheese AFTER the meat is cooked. Trust me it will melt just fine when it's all put together. 

With these few prep and cooking protocol changes Smashburger will regain my patronage. Until then, I won't eat another burger there.

Good luck guys.

{"text":"Short: Go to Carl's Jr. or Fatburger. Seriously. Nothing special here, and wishy-washy proportions and quality. 

Long: Arrived here around 7pm for some late to-go dinner. Was met with a dull \"Welcome\" and ordered my food from someone who seemed like they couldn't smile.
When I got home with my food, it was terrible.
The Sin City burger's buns were falling apart, so I couldn't hold and eat it. All the toppings were smeared with sauce and grease--which is fine--but it made it all taste like the same mush. No texture other than soggy mush.
The Truffle Mushroom Swiss burger was a bit better and could be eaten by hand.
The sides were the worse:
The fries were STALE. They weren't crunchy, but hard and had a off after-taste. I didn't finish them.
The haystack onions were a complete joke. The serving was the size of a half-cup measuring cup--a bit larger than the sauce cup they came with. This filled a quarter of the fry container they came in. And they were soaked with oil. It took a couple napkins to soak up all the oil. Then they were mushy--nothing like haystack onions.

I will not return here as there's better food elsewhere. You can get better sides at any fast-food restaurant, and better burgers at places like Carl's Jr. and Fatburger--for a better price!"}
{"text":"BEST GOT DAM BURGER I EVER ATE IN MY LIFE !!!!! I got the sin city burger with Chipotle sauce on the side with the rosemary and garlic olive oil fry OMG !!! swear best burger period !! It was juicy and tasty perfectly seasoned the beef tasted prime !! Like fresh as I don't know what and every detail is flawless I was shocked lol"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch at about 11:00, I was greeted by a gentlemen at the counter who took my order, I went with the regular smash burger with cheese, he offered the upgrade to the larger burger, I decided to stick with the basic and I ordered a small order of the smash fries. I decided to just have water. I appreciated getting a regular sized plastic fountain drink glass as opposed to the tiny, cheap ones most places provide! My order was delivered to my table within about 7-10 minutes! The food was fresh and hot! The toppings on the burger were very fresh and stacked nicely! The fries were excellent, the olive oil and rosemary make for a great combination on the shoestring cut potatoes! Overall I was very satisfied and highly recommend this location! Both of the staff members I encountered were polite and friendly! The only thing I might do differently next time is order the salted caramel shake, a fellow at the table next to mine had one, it looked great and not only did he get the shake but they also bring the metal shake cup with extra in it to the table, he said it was awesome! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed with this place. The restaurant wreaked of raw, bloody beef. The whole place was filthy with food all over the floors and the tables were dirty. I got a grilled cheese with the veggie frites and everything was so oil saturated that I couldn't even eat it. My husband got a burger and he said it would have been better had it not been dripping excessive oil the whole time. It's definitely not vegetarian friendly, which is fine considering that it is a hamburger place. But I won't return."}
{"text":"Only a few days in business and the food is good!  Burgers and toppings are well done... The Smash Fries are flavorful without being 'too much.'  A little expensive for the portions, but not excessive. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Bbq bacon chedder burger , sweet potato smash fries and a chocolate shake. Great, great and fair price."}
{"text":"This place is a mix of fast food places, expect a Hardee's level burger (better bun though) and mcdonalds quality fries. The food was good but not worth the premium they are charging.  City Tavern is right across the street and has a much better burger and fries, on Monday you can even get it for $5.

Also the booths are sized completely wrong, make you feel like a 5yr old."}
{"text":"Inside Decor:  4 Stars - nice clean tables.  
Service: 5 Stars - very nice staff, and the food was delivered to our table pretty quick and everything was correct.
Food: 3 Stars - the Kids Cheeseburger got rave reviews, my daughter said it was better than mcnuggets, and better than The Original Hamburger Works (down in Phoenix, next to Encanto Park) so I give hers a \"5-stars\" score.   I ordered the Arizona Smashburger (1/2 lb) and was generally satisfied (4-stars).  This was my first time there, so I was not familiar with all the hub-bub of the \"Smash\" - but the 1/2lb burger was a good 1/2\" wider than the bun itself.  Not a pretty site.  The Guac was so-so, chunky but lacked a savoryness.  The Habanero Cheese, Chiptole Mayo and fresh (not pickled) jalapenos were all very nice.  I would have preferred a thicker hunk of beef, and the same fixings.  The red onion was pithy and only one thin slice, while they did give me two thin slices of tomato where were enough to give about 50% coverage of the \"smashed-out\" beef patty.  The pepper bun was nice, I'd like to get them for my regular grilled burgers actually.  Good bread, held up very good with the rest of the burger.  The Kids Fries - eh...  thin and I didn't take a bite but for the record they looked to have the same dimensions as the Fast-food golden arches fries.  The Onion Rings (ahem... Haystack) were a HUGE disappointment.  I like a thick cut onion, nicely battered and fried.  These were pithy thin, tiny slivers of onions dripping with batter and goo... not what I would recommend anytime. (Burger, 4-stars, Onion Haystack 1 Star, net it out, 3 Stars for my meal.)  I guess I don't get the whole \"Smash\" thing.  Call me a noob, but don't call me to go back there again.

If you are a picky burger guy like me...  and like to \"dress your burger\" all fancy, or if you are a picky minimalist... I have to recommend Fudds or The Original Hamburger Works.  If you want a $7 burger that is pretty good but don't want to be bothered with putting the toppings on yourself (or if you are a germophobe and shudder at the openness of the toppings in the customer area) then this is the place for you.  Good Service, Clean surroundings.  

Final Verdict: 3.5 Stars (but 4 on the yelp page because at heart, I am a HUGE softie, and my daughter did like her burger a lot!!)"}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was great. A man, who I presumed to be the owner, came over a couple of times to check on our family and make sure we were doing okay. As we were leaving, we received the most sincere thank you for coming to the restaurant. Oh and I love that they have American style ice tea!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited Smashburger for lunch on Wednesday. It was around 11:30am, so the restaurant was fairly empty. After carefully perusing the menu I chose the BBQ, Bacon and Cheddar burger and a side of Smashfries. Let's start with the burger. To be honest, I was expecting more. The beef patty was quite thin and very greasy for $6. The barbecue sauce, bacon and cheddar added flavor which helped to improve the dining experience.  I am truly sorry to say that it was downhill from the burger. The fries were just bad. For $2 you get the equivalent of a McDonalds medium size fries (I am being generous). They were crisp, but had very little flavor. I almost always enjoy my fries sans ketchup, but had to resort to the tomato based condiment to get some of the Smashfries down.

Since I usually follow the 3-strikes rule, I will probably give Smashbuger another shot. Who knows?  Maybe I can do a better job of item selection from the vast menu."}
{"text":"Service was great -- Bun to meat ratio was decent. I didn't care for the rosemary garlic OILY fries, as soon as they cooled off they were soggy and not very pleasing to the stomach..

I did enjoy the flavorful meat, it was quite juicy. I ordered a mushroom swiss and I dont think they gave enough of the fixings. The children's menu was your average selection. The size of the meal was good for children under 5. Otherwise if you had children 12 and under they'd be screaming for more the portion is a bit small. I, myself go to fudruckers and order a kids meal and am completely stuffed! 

I dont think I'd be trying this place for AWHILE. But I do give credit that their meat is very tasteful. But I like where I can pile my condiments and fixings myself at fud's, which is not to far away from here."}
{"text":"Praise the lord!  There is a fast(ish) food restaurant near(ish) Crowfoot that serves a decent veggie burger!  I've already been to Smashburger three times, each time having their Spicy Baja Black Bean Burger with a side of smash fries (and on my last visit I also indulged in a milkshake as I had a 50% off coupon).  The veggie burger here is no imitation meat product- it's a handmade patty that is falling apart full of black beans- get it signature style with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and jalapeños on a spicy chipotle bun, or use it in place of the meat in one of their other burgers, like mushroom swiss or avocado club.  Skip the plain fries and opt for the same-price smash fries instead- they are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.

The three times I've visited I've taken my food to go, as I'm ashamed to be seen in a fast food restaurant (yeah, yeah...), and they do a great job of packaging the food so that it stays in perfect condition.  We're talking plastic hamburger cases and poutine with the wet ingredients packaged separately.  Dine-in looks nicer than most fast-food places; maybe one day I'll overcome the shame!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've ever had in my life. Friendly staff, decent decor, and smash fries are to die for."}
{"text":"I've never left a review but they definitely deserve it. 

This was my first visit at any Smash burger and I have to say the food was incredible, but this location has nothing but a staff full of rude teenagers that care more about flirting than customer service. I was treated like an inconvenience and I will never come back to this location. 
Getting my chair repeatedly hit with the broom while this girl swept made it difficult to eat my food and the dirty looks we're enough to make me leave before even finishing my meal. 
This Smash burger is 2 minutes from my house but I will gladly drive to the Tempe location to avoid the exceptionally terrible staff. I would recommend doing the same."}
{"text":"I am currently 25 minutes in to waiting for my chicken sandwich.  I have given up all hope.  There is an insane line here but nothing seems to be happening.  If it is very late in Vegas and you are looking for something better than traditional fast food, it is not this place.  The employees are now yelling at the customers.  We are ditching and so are a lot of other customers:  this is literally the worst."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this location 3x now and we've always experienced great customer service. Smashburger is one of my favorite chain restaurants for burgers and chicken sandwiches. Only took one star away b/c it's a chain and chain 
restaurants just can't beat local mom and pop burger joints IMO."}
{"text":"Food is great, better than most burger places. Seating is limited. Cashiers are knowledgeable about the menu. Nice drink selection as well as alcoholic beverages. Great place. High prices are what makes me give 3 stars."}
{"text":"First thing, the facility was very clean, a huge piece to the review puzzle. Ordering was easy, the staff friendly and able to answer questions. The food is jaw dropping in more ways than one. I actually taste the meat in the burger, it's not over spiced or inundated with too many toppings.(I had the mushroom swiss, VERY good!!!) the fried pickles and sweet potato fries accented the mushroom Swiss well. All around a great place. Perfectly palette pleasing!!!"}
{"text":"This location recently opened at the end of April. I have been to another location but tried this one today. I had a burger at the other location, however, my last 2 experiences including todays, I have opted for the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. This is rather tasty. There is bluecheese on it, plenty of sauce, hearty piece of grilled or fried chicken, and lettuce and tomato top it off. I typically use a fork to eat this sandwich as the sauce likes to drip, but I like eating all my sandwiches with a fork, so maybe its just me! 

We enjoyed a basket of fries which were nothing special but still good. 

Service was pleasant and enjoyable. Everyone was very friendly, including the manager who ran most the food out to his customers!"}
{"text":"I had a chicken sandwich and fries. Both were tasty. They have a GF bun which is pretty good. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. You order everything a la carte so the price adds up quickly. The parking is awful."}
{"text":"I must admit, that prior to dining at Smashburger, I was a little irked, considering that it seems like every Smashburger I've seen has been built extremely close to In N' Out, a burger chain that is extremely dear to my heart (both in terms of sentiment and the plaque building in my arteries because of those damned delicious double doubles).  However, outright audacity aside, I had also been curious for a while, as I'm a girl who enjoys a good burger, no matter the source.  So, off I went.

I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and my companion ordered the All American Burger.  We also ordered the sweet potato fries and the regular fries.  It did take a bit to get our food, even though there weren't many people there.  I must also say that I wasn't pleased with the prices -- It's kind of ridiculous for two people to spend 18 dollars on hamburgers and fries (we didn't get drinks, either) when it's not even a sit-down restaurant with some sense of atmosphere.  

Anyway.  Back to the food.  I had mixed feelings about my burger.  The BBQ sauce was pretty good, as was the bun.  However, the bacon, sadly, was pretty scarce, as were the fried onions that accompanied the burger.  Also, the patty, while juicy and a good size, was really, really salty, almost too salty for my liking (and trust me, I'm not a gal that shies away from sodium).  I sort of felt like this was a hamburger that I could make myself at home, which also contributed to the feeling of, \"Why the hell does this cost so much\" that lingered throughout my meal.  My companion's burger was fine in the sense that it was what we ordered and in the neighborhood of what I expected, but was also very salty.  The burgers were also pretty greasy, which was kind of a turn-off for me.  

I had mixed feelings about the fries.  The regular fries were fine, although they could have used a little bit more garlic.  The sweet potato fries, however, were a huge disappointment and left me fantasizing about the goodness that is Create's sweet potato fries.  The rosemary just wasn't working for me with the sweet potato fries, and they were so, so oily, that I was pretty disgusted when I worked my way down to the bottom of my fry holder and there was a huge puddle of grease/oil (which, strangely, wasn't the case with the regular fries).

This place was... okay.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great, either.  Nothing really jumped out at me during my visit, and I kind of felt like I'd been had.  I'm glad I tried it, but honestly, for the money I dropped here, I'd rather have spent that money somewhere else (i.e., burger bar, create, bachi burger, etc.).  I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Started liking this place when we lived in Denverm. Happy to find one so close by in Desert Ridge when we moved back to Phoenix.  However,  over the last year,  this location has declined steadily. Service is non-existent,  takes 20 minutes to order even if there are only 3 people in line, tables are always dirty so no place to sit. This location needs new management."}
{"text":"Has some interesting burgers here. And the fries were awesome. Definitely better than campus food. The only problem was the slow service which was no fun. Especially since I was with a large party."}
{"text":"The food was excellent burger even better than five guys. The cashier was not overly friendly a and acted like it was a big deal to show me the size of the fries."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the taste explodes with flavor, but the portion for french fries are very weak. any large at other resturants destroys this place on that. But other places do not season like this place, and the menu has fried pickes if you never tries them. But like I said small portion on the sides."}
{"text":"The service is excellent.  Alicia was fast to drop what she was doing and welcome us. She made sure our order was correct, and promptly fixed the issue we had.  Treat her well. you have a great employee on your hands. 
as soon as all the customers left every table is clean."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries! My boyfriend and I regular this location often and we always receive great service and great food. The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is that the booths are always dirty and that's always where we want to sit but can't. Think they should hire a busser."}
{"text":"We were disappointed.  For our fast the burger was too juicy...but as a result of their cooking style.  This caused our hamburger bun to get soggy.  The serving of french fries was small.  The ambiance was nice.  But too expensive for the quality of food."}
{"text":"This place is really good and I love seeing you I would tell my friends it is shitty here I'll come here every day so I can hear"}
{"text":"$20 for a 2 burgers, 1 small fries and 2 drinks.........I wanted to order 2 milkshakes but my mortgage is due!!! .....and the burger was tiny . First time and last time. Five Guys is much better."}
{"text":"I've went to a couple Smash Burger, but this one by far is the worst. The customer service was as good as it was going to get the food was somewhat similar to other locations I've visited. Its smaller then most witch is bad because its packed most of the time. Over all its still a good place to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The  only  complaint  I  have  about  this  place  is  the  parking  but  I  wouldn't  hesitate  to go  again.   Their  burgers  were  great,  loved  the  fried  pickles  and  the  smash  fries  were  outstanding.  We  couldn't  believe  how  clean  and  well  ordered  it  was,  the  cook  got  the  meat  just  right  as  I  dislike  under  done  or  over  done  meat  and  he  had  no  problem  with  a  special  order  like  that.   A  very  good  experience ."}
{"text":"Love the fresh food here: fries, condiments, & salads. I usually get a #1 w/fries. My son, being a non meat eater gets the black bean burger w/chipotle mayo & guacamole w/fried pickles. He loves this place for the veggie alternative!
Service is excellent for a burger joint. They are quick to serve & quick to remove plates. Tables cleaned for the next visitor."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here. This place is DIRTY. No running water in women's restrooms. Soap dispenser is broke on men's. Yellow iron on the floor beneath the men's urinal. Both have empty toilet seat protectors. The floors are dirty, doors are dirty like they haven't been wiped down in a while.

It's 11:30 am ..... they just opened at 11. So they don't clean this facility. 

I hope the owner sees this and fixes this problem. Bad experience"}
{"text":"Shocked to experience the bad customer service from this store. Me and my family went Monday night. We got there 10 minutes before closing time, when we were noticed a young female runs to turn off the open sign light off and rushes to the the door to lock it then looks at us and laughs and then turned around started celebrating by jumping and throwing her hands in the air."}
{"text":"Smashburger sounds like just another hamburger joint but this truly stands out as one of the premier hamburger joints with fresh quality ingredients and a simple uncomplicated menu.

 I love a good bacon and cheese burger and this one topped the scale at a nine for me. Because they use real cheddar cheese and because they use real cheddar cheese and You can get it with the shoestring onion rings on top which is a nice treat."}
{"text":"it's been along time since I've had a good hamburger.I ordered a classic and it was great!!! I will go back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Staff friendly and fast but the burgers here are awful!! This is second time I've tried and they are salty as tears. I wanted to like this place- it's so close to my house but no. I couldn't even finish the burger it was so damn salty. :("}
{"text":"A little disappointed with SmashBurger. Today was our first time and we ordered food to pick-up. We got there at the pick-up time and they said a few more mins. After waiting 20 mins past the time, I asked someone else who said \"Oh, you're ready\" and handed us a bag. They made mistakes on two of the four burgers we ordered. I am giving a three because the burger tasted very good. Since mine had the wrong bun, could've have been better."}
{"text":"First visit to Smashburger. Food was very good and the staff was over the top polite and attentive. Definitely will eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been here for two month for work. I've eaten here for lunch quite a few times during that time. Never disappoints. The food has been great each and everytime. And the staff has always been friendly and great! I don't hesitate to eat here!"}
{"text":"*Gamestop Burger*


Visiting a friend in Phoenix I first see Smashburger from the street. Upon first glance my other friend and I thought it was a Gamestop cuz the sign looked just like it. We both said \"Haha, we thought that was a Gamestop.\"
Our friend goes, \"Yeah I first thought that too when I first saw it. It's pretty good there. Do you guys wanna go?\" 

So we ended up eating our first meal in Phoenix at Smashburger, and we were glad we did. The food was really good, and the smashfires were a great addition to our burgers.

I ordered the BBQ Bacon & Cheese. It was quite delicious, and a little on the greasy side. BUT that's where all the flavor is!!!!!

This burger has some hot steamy buns. Yeah I said it .
Unlike most places that use the typical sesame seed bun Smashburger uses egg buns. These buns are a lot softer and compliment the burger very nicely. 

I decided to order the smashfries which are seasoned with garlic and rosemary. These were an awesome choice. For those of you who may not like those flavors they offer regular fries as well. 

Seeing that I hadn't eaten since morning I also ordered the Arizona devil dog. This had guacamole, tomatoes, jalapenos, habenero cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce all on an all beef hot dog. I liked it. It was like nachos minus the chips on my hot dog. 

Now this place is on the pricey side, but if you feel like dishing out $8+ for a burger and fries then this place is not too shabby. 

Different locations call for different items on the menu, so don't be surprised if the Arizona devil dog cannot be found outside of Arizona. I say that they should combine all the regional menus to make one giant-mega selection-awesomeness menu. But I highly doubt that'll happen."}
{"text":"Just a great restaurant. Always a super friendly staff, very clean, and fast. We stop in once or twice a month during the day for lunch and the manager is so impressive. Very hands on, cleaning, helping guests.. Just a great guy."}
{"text":"Great food the first time there.  Food is always good, service is a little slow but hopefully just due to getting employees in the groove.  Veggie side is great."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean with modern decor. Not bad,  a little simplistic. 

The wife's burger came out first and with no sweet potato fries. We waited awhile for the other burger, but when it arrived it was delicious. Both dinners were good,  the food was of a good quality and the servers worked hard to please. 

Overall a good place for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers and fries. They have a delicious Veggie Burger as well! Strongly recommend it. If you want a burger!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Managed poorly. Ran out of milk shakes. Ran out of ice tea. Ran out of cherry coke. Ran out of dr. Pepper. Chef cussing up a storm."}
{"text":"The place is located conveniently but the parking sucks. You wouldn't know it by looking at it, but everyone is zipping in from Baseline. And then the cars are parked in an eddy, and people trying to walk in and out, it's a circus. 

The girl at the front must've been on speed. She was running at 100 mph, talking fast and loud. She was very hard to understand. The experience with her was both comical and frustrating. It was not busy at all."}
{"text":"I have to admit they have definitely upped they're game and quality of service. I had some really bad experience last year and vowed to never return. My friend pursuaded me to go, and it was a good decision. Good food, good customer service and friendly employees."}
{"text":"TWICE now I've been served undercooked (as in RED, not pink - see the photo I posted) ground beef at this location in a relatively short period of time. Unlike steak, it's never ok to eat undercooked ground beef. Even if nothing else touched the grill it's dangerous to eat undercooked ground beef.

When it happened the first time, I wrote it off as a fluke because franchises should have set-in-stone procedures for preparing every food item for sale. I'm sure Smashburger does have such standards but they're not followed at this location.

I've also experienced other gaffs here but won't go into detail because I don't want to detract from the issue of the food poisoning waiting to happen here.

Go to a different location, or eat somewhere else entirely. Just because your last burger was ok doesn't mean your next one will be. It would of course be ridiculous to write off both of my experiences as exceptionally coincidental."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to the team that was there when this location first opened but they either need to come back or Smash Burger corporate needs to close this place. The food is at best just ok. The management and help need to learn about customer service. Check your order before you walk out. 

To give you an idea how deplorable it is, I drive to 24th Street and Baseline to get my SmashBurger fix. That place is great. The food is actually hot when it's served. Imagine that. The entire team is friendly and I am made to feel welcomed no matter how busy. What a breath of fresh air. 

I guess the benefit of driving to the Alma School location is that there's an In-N-Out right across the street. 

If I could, I'd give this once a 5 star place, zero stars. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"I like this place the family likes this place burgers are good I wish they were a little bigger so I would say there a little bit overpriced.
Parking is terrible you can get nowhere near the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is great but tue service was not. No one taking orders for almost 5 minutes and a huge line developed. When they finally came back only ONE person took orders. Long wait for food."}
{"text":"An overall great experience!  Really good food, and very friendly staff.  They missed a couple things on the order, but went out of their way to make it right.

Clean store, nice staff - an overall 5 star visit!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst smash burger when it comes to managing customers and seating. Not only is it full but many people are taking up four top tables that could be separated for others to sit. People are rude and fighting for places to sit. It seems that the staff here do not care. Although I like the food, I don't think I'll be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"sonya is a very nice person and i had a wonderful experience at this smash burger location. the service was excellent and their wasn't a wait i really recommend this smash burger !!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is right down the street from my apartment and I've been wanting to try it for some time. I got the BBQ, bacon, and cheese burger with Smash fries and it was great. The buns were my favorite, they are really soft and not squished at all. There was a fried onion on top and that added the best type of crunch on top that juicy, juicy burger. I was told their fries were the best and I did enjoy them. Although I've had better, they're still worth getting.
My rommate got a hot dog and I took a bite and was amazed at how moist the bun was. It was a poppyseed bun and the dog was split whcih gave it an even juicier flavor."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The classic burger is good with the sauce; which is like frudruckers. And the smash fries are good too, but kinda greasy."}
{"text":"The food is really good but every time I order it, it doesn't matter how many people are in line, it still takes 30 mins to be done. And it's one hamburger so think it's time to take my 30 min lunches somewhere else"}
{"text":"In a word: smashing... What can you say other than consistently good burgers every time. Fries tend to be plentiful. Veggies are fresh. Relatively convenient location. Stop reading this and just go here!"}
{"text":"Great menu. Arizona burger was great... Unfortunately the guys that work here don't know what good service is. The women that work there do tho....the girl cashier offered me water and another girl who bagged my to go order apologized for the delay...the guys were more interested in talking to each other than waiting on people"}
{"text":"I go here very often and I'm never disappointed. Burgers are a step above the rest. When I do a high protein diet, this is the first place on my list, I just ask for no bun and extra veggies and it comes on a plate.They accept online orders now so I'm even happier."}
{"text":"Bad quality. Mediocre and overpriced. Go to Wendy's and save some money."}
{"text":"It should be called Trashburger. Don't waist your money go to Wendy's or any fast food restaurant. Mediocre and overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent ...on the good days, food is very fresh, juicy and tasty...same for fries...
On an off day...food tastes rushed and bland along with soggy fries dripping with too much oil.

The northeast location has a better and more consistent experience...Hoping this location gets better sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"The Smashburger Sin City burger is the best in Vegas.  Addictive, and not diet food, but definitely delicious and worth the price and the trip."}
{"text":"When you look for delivery,  Smashburger comes up.   When you look at their attributes, it says they don't deliver.   Probably a Yelp problem,  but  it needs to be fixed. . ."}
{"text":"Walked into smash burger and wasn't greeted immediately but still was noticed and promptly asked for my order. We had a coupon for a free meal and was no issue with the coupon being accosted. The building seems very tidy and clean and enjoyed my meal. Yet the temperature in the building was quite chilly. Make sure you bring a jacket with you I would tell you haha."}
{"text":"The dirtiest smash burger I've ever seen. Trash overflowing in the dirty restroom, all supplies depleted..no napkins, ketchup etc. not real busy and the staff standing around instead of cleaning the mess or sticking napkins, etc."}
{"text":"The young lady at the register was nice and greeted me with respect. I ordered a jalapeno baja burger and fries with cheese on them. The girl that handed me the food wasn't as nice or respectful as the register gal, and when I received my food the fries didn't have the cheese so I asked kindly for them to add it and the lady didn't say anything and took it back. When I received the food back, the fries had cheese on them, except it was an unmelted piece of cheese that they use on burgers. Stellar job, cook. The burger itself was tasty but the bun was soggy with grease. I hate to complain but I paid $16 for something I could have gotten at burger king."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place? Love the smashfries, burgers, and hot dogs. Our go-to place for delicious burgers!

(SO much better than 5 guys.)"}
{"text":"Burgers weren't that bad, the hubby and I enjoyed them however the sides lol!!! Another story... We got the fried pickles, granted pickles are a little tart so to say but the batter... The batter wasn't even edible! The haystack onions.... Salty salty salty.. I really do not believe they serve them that way all the time or at least I hope not... I think someone actually accidentally dropped a container of salt in the batter and just said eff it.... Anyway haven't been back since Create is across the street and they are much better!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a burger. The spicy baja burger is to die for and their Smashfries are amazing! And to top it off, the staff is always so friendly! I've never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"Gave Smashbuger a try for the first time and was not disappointed. My husband and I were greeted as soon as we walked in and offered help with the menu if needed. We both ordered the regular smash burger and smash fries. The burgers were very flavorful and juicy. The egg buns soft and fresh. We will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"So I work in the office complex right next to this Smashburger. I have several issues with this Smashburger but sadly continue to go there because they are the only burger place close enough to walk for my half hour lunch.  My issue are as follows.

1. The running joke in our office is \"What will our mystery meal be today?\"  This is because regardless of what we order we wind up with something different every time. The last time I went there was Tuesday of this same week and the order was so wrong, and I since I walk there I was a little annoyed they were out of togo cup lids. They were also out of large bags to carry the 4 smaller paper bags full of food for my whole office, and ice cream for a milkshake. I called them when I got back to the office because our order was so wrong and got their voicemail and left a very detailed message with my name and that I would like a manager or owner to call me back. No one ever called.

2. Today I checked my order before leaving and it was wrong AGAIN! I decided to bring it to their attention the problem with the consistency and expeditor accuracy of the food. This was received by the shift leader with an apology and an offer to remake my food, but the young man who took my order decided to argue with me about what I order first. When I pointed out to the shift leader that I had left a message on their answering maching addressing this issue and never got a courtesy call back he tried to say their phones got disconnected. I explained I got their voicemail left a message and still no call back.  After that the manager called back to the kitchen to advise them there was a cheese substitutaion and a cook named Ryan argued and yelled back at him rudely.

3. Before he could finish helping me another manager pulled him aside and started lecturing him in great detail about something in a booth in front of all the customers.

4. When they completed our order I apologized to a young woman manager for making a fuss but they had a right to know they their order accuracy is terrible. She apologized this fact and said they are trying to work on this and other issues.

5. Upon returning to the office and opening my lovely little present from \"Ryan\" one burger was assembled so haphazardly that the top of the bun was saturated in mustard and mayo and  when we opened the paper the burger fell out of the bun and on the floor. The other had a ridiculously large amout of onions piled on it and the same issues with the burger not being assembled neatly enough to be eaten with your hands.

6. On a side note. Was also unimpressed that the girl that works their with the pink and black hair who had screwed up the expedition of my order on Tuesday was in the store on her day off eating with her friend and cursing/bickering with the kid behind the counter about how she works her ass off and needs a day off, and at one point took a cup that she didn't want  but had her hands all over back up to the front counter and put it back with the other cups for the new customers and I watched him give it to the next person in line.

7.  Oh and the kid that rang me up and handles the money went straight from there to the pass thru window and started handling orders coming out of the kitchen without washing his hands, and while he was handling my food and putting the condiments in bags there was a kid standing right next to the condiment/prep table trying to stuff one trashbag full of trash into another bag full of trash and then take them both out of the trashcan.  So gross and unsanitary.


Understand this is all while a shift leader and two managers are in the store, but the female assistant manager was the only one working in the store, because the other manager was talking to the shift leader in front of the customers about back of house issues.

I realize it's just a burger place, but they tout themselves charge more for being fresh and a little more than some drive thru shack.

The fact is I feel bad for whoever bought this franchise because his employees are doing them a huge disservice.  Good product and good location terrible management and customer service."}
{"text":"We had stopped at this Smashburger last night. We were shocked to first find out the place was filthy, had to ask for some napkins to wipe down a table because they were all dirty. The bathroom and areas around trash cans looked like a storm had hit. 

After ordering, we sat down and realized there were several people waiting on food. Also, the servers were noticeably arguing with the kitchen staff. We decided to look on Yelp to see reviews. That's when we realized we had stopped at the wrong place. 

When we received our food, the hamburger was raw, as you can see in the picture below. We had them make another hamburger, which was fine. Also, the onion strings, pictured, looked as if they were picked up out of the trash. We didn't eat them out of fear for our health. We also had fries, which were cooked ok. 

When we left, we let the shift manager know they should be embarrassed by the experience and food they are providing there. 

We have a Smashburger in our neighborhood, Laveen, which we love. It is well run with good service and great food. 

We have sent an email to the corporate office."}
{"text":"Over priced. Over rated. The goat cheese has zero flavor, my chicken was paper thin, the red onion completely dominated all of the flavor profiles. I won't eat there again"}
{"text":"Walked in and stood in line for 20 minutes while they messed up everyone's order. Sat in a very messy dining room. Staff was horrible and the manager was the most worthless one of the bunch. I would strongly recommend choosing another place to eat and spend your money"}
{"text":"Yummy. My first Smashburger. I opted for the Sin City Burger. I am eating as I type, hard because this burger is messy. Messy but very good. This is a new store I believe. We had our burgers to go because it smelled like they had a sewer vent pipe problem. However, the food was great."}
{"text":"I will have to say that the service was poor on my visit.  Although this is a new place, it still serves fast food style menu options in which it took 15 mins for me to get my order on when there were 3 people and two managers doing nothing.  The food is subpar and kind of reminds me of the heart attack grill in which the burgers had so much butter and grease on it that's all I could taste.  For the price I expect
 something better and received nothing but disappointment."}
{"text":"If you in the mood for a good burger or salad you can't go wrong!! Spicy Baja beef or chicken very good. I do like the smash fries better than the regular ones. The shakes are also very good"}
{"text":"Worker Taylor is super crazy awesome! Made my first experience here good! Foods good too! Also workers are pretty cute"}
{"text":"Hopefully just the night, but this has been the slowest, dirtiest, smash burger I've ever been to. All trash cans overflowing, staff moving really slow, and food took ages. Not to mention they ran out of shakes at 645pm. Bummer."}
{"text":"Dirty place...3/4 of the tables were dirty in the place
Garbage and plate area was overflowing
I dont think anyone cleans the place
There were four guys working...two cooking, one taking orders and one fulfilling orders 
Someone really needs to clean the place
Because it's a small restaurant..when its dirty it looks pretty dumpy
We wont be back..I'd rather go to Fudruckers by the mall or even Chilis for a burger just as good! You end up paying almost $10 bucks for a burger fries and drink so I' rather go somewhere at least clean and with table service if I am spending that much!"}
{"text":"This place is run by children that don't care to be there. The quality of food has gone down big time. Disgusting food that was clearly not cooked at proper temperatures because it was soaked in oil. The manager tanner was rude to my 4 year old!!! GROW UP"}
{"text":"These burgers are so delicious. They're rather small but so yummie. Visiting from Cali"}
{"text":"this was my first visit to a smash burger, the burgers were very good, It was the fries that will make me come back. The service was excellent. I will be returning to try the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Got the mushroom swiss burger YUM and sweet potato fries. Definitely would like to try some of the other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is very good! This place is an upgrade from Mc D's.I like the thin sliced onion rings."}
{"text":"Great gluten free buns!!! I had a grilled chicken sandwich with smash sauce, pepper jack cheese abd avocado.  The bun was soft and tasty. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I went twice here for lunch cuz I'm a student at euphoria and there's limited options of where to eat depending if you have a car or if you walk. But I've never been to any smash burger until this week and I loved it. 
I had the spicy jalapeño Baja burger and it was really good! The only thing I have to say about it is that they didn't put enough jalepeneos on it but other than that it was really good. The service was good too everyone who worked there was super nice and got everything done swiftly and easy making my trip there and back during lunch easy."}
{"text":"Will not be going back! Went other night to get food for family...\"knoelle\" the host seemed very annoyed that I came in to order and wasn't sure what I wanted. So I order 3 meals and a shake.  Right after taking my order she then turns around and immediately starts playing with her iPhone, checking messages and what not. She then goes to back to play with her other co workers. As I watch my food being played and ready to go, my host \"knoelle\" finally decides she'll make the shake I ordered. I told her no thank you and got my money back."}
{"text":"LITERALLY found a 3/4 inch glass shard in my chicken sandwich. Poor shift manager didn't know what to do but all we got after spending $30 was a $5 off coupon for our NEXT purchase. Disturbing. Where did it come from and who else has eaten glass without knowing?? I will post a picture if I can ever figure out how to on this app. 

Since this post I was contacted and informed the kitchen has been cleaned, staff educated on how to handle these situations for the future, and the food distributors made aware. They are mailing me a gift card as well. Hopefully this will never happen again."}
{"text":"Fast, clean and staff is super friendly. Veggie burger is good. Has a slight kick. Cheeseburger, Oreo Shake and fries also yummy. Nice to get good food in the belly before boarding the plane back to Boston"}
{"text":"Great service!!! Friendly staff    : :) food bit pricey not that filling, o burger not cooked correctly, dont know what the hype is!! I rather go the Habiat Burger!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite."}
{"text":"Yep I am definitely a fan of Smashburger. I had heard good things about it and I was in the neighborhood, so I decided to give it a try. I got the Spicy Jalapeno Baja burger with Smash fries. The Smash fries were good and I liked that they were shoestring fries. I found they were well seasoned and you get a generous portion. My friend got the veggie fries and those were delicious. They were composed of green beans, red peppers and sweet potatoes lightly fried. I only tried a couple, but I liked them a lot and would definitely get those again.

The burger was also really good. The patty itself was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the bun was a good size, making a good bun to burger ratio. This burger was a bit messy due to having both chipotle mayo and guacamole on it. But the veggies were fresh and the toppings worked well together. My only issue is there was a bit too much red onion on it. I don't mind raw red onion, but too much of it can be overpowering to the palate.

It is worth a try, and though it's far from where I live, I would certainly go back!"}
{"text":"I had the goat cheese spinach burger and it tasted very good. Service was ok as well. After reading all the negative reviews about the bug on the floor and the poor hygiene, no hand washing after dealing with the cash register and food back and forth etc. I kinda lost my appetite. Even though I had a good exprerience at this location and the burger was very tasty, I would like to be sure that every time I go to this location I get the same great service with clean washed hands and no bugs in the kitchen that could end up in my burger. Yikes."}
{"text":"Food is good. However, no one at this location is competent. On a Thursday evening (it was dinner time) the place wasn't even all that busy. However it took 20+ min for them to bring our food out. They messed up every order in front of us and the line to ask about wronged orders was as long as the line to order. Management either needs to learn how to manage the place or needs to come in and show these employees how to be competent. If you like Smash Burger, my suggestion is to find a location that can actually follow an order in a timely manner."}
{"text":"If you just want a wonderful hamburger (or en equally good chicken breast \"burger\"), then Smashburger is excellent.  We've been here several times since my initial review, kept to the hamburger side of the menu, and loved it.  Also, the sweet potato fries were well-sized again and they brought the whole meal at one time.  So, with that in mind, I've upped my initial rating to 4 stars out of 5.  We're still a bit let down with the removal of several menu items (Chili -- please add that back, Smashburger), and the music is too young for our old ears.  But, it's well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Self-proclaimed burger connoisseur here...
The first time I visited Smashburger, it was very good. The 2nd and 3rd times yielded the same results. And that's just it: at this price, I need burger to be BANGING! 
Don't get me wrong, the burgers are good and juicy as they state. Today, I opted for the bacon cheeseburger with all the fixings - onions, pickles, ketchup, mustard plus grilled onions. The pickle had a bit of a strong flavor for me but wasn't bad. The thing that threw me was the egg bun. The flavor of the bun was nothing special, but it was a little tougher than I'd like.
To me, the best thing at this place is the Smashfries - tossed with olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Mmmm.
I'll return on another coupon offer - I am a member of the Smash Club.  
Overall, it's good. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried the classic burger and their regular fries...and that's all it took. I was WON over!  I need to bring my friends here as the burgers are well made, the fries are nicely seasoned, and they have $1 Coronas!  I am a fan, and every time I drive by I think back to that burger!  ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped by last week while in the neighbourhood after hearing so many good things about this place.

Pros:
Clean space, love the decor - so fun!
Friendly service, the guy who helped us was so nice it was almost weird for Calgary
Burgers made fresh when you order them
Lots of great menu items - I had the Calgary burger and smash fries, both really tasty 

Cons:
Far for me to travel in Calgary without a car
Prices are reasonable to high, but the good quality makes you feel better about what you pay for
It would be nice if they had a bison burger or gluten free buns (a girl can dream, right?!)

I'd definitely go back again when craving a good burger if not in the mood to hit up a pub.  Great little space and not very crowded, worth a visit!"}
{"text":"First and last time at this establishment. Received my burger and it was so under cooked that almost the entire burger was still cool ground beef. With the burger swimming in ketchup I hadn't noticed until the second bite and I have now been sick for almost 8 hours."}
{"text":"One of my favs for a burger joint!!!! 

My hubby got an American Classic Burger with veggie frites and Classic Hotdog for my son, wow : ) what a TREAT!  It was so good and yummy....oh man, practice self control while I'm here....its that good!!!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical after reading the other reviews, however, I still had high hopes and was really craving a burger.  After spending over $10 on a Classic with a side of fries (the Smashburger ones), I had really expected a better overall experience.  The burger was overcooked (I had ordered medium rare), incredibly salty, and void of any real flavor.  There was too much ketchup and mustard.  The huge tomato was sliced too thickly and was not all ripe.  The single wilted piece of lettuce helped the whole ensemble slide around while attempting to eat this monstracity.  On a final note, the cheese melted into a goo that conjured up memories of the cheese you'd get on movie theater nachos.  Oh and let me not forgot to mention the fries - shoestring, greasy, and not at all satisfying.  Honestly I've had better burgers and fries at McDonalds (in which I'm no fan).  Invest your money and calories elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good burger, lots of bun and cheese options, free fries for a returned review, and they serve Cheerwine.  I'm down."}
{"text":"It's a sort of fast food but sort of not fast food kinda place. A little hard to really nail it down but it's for sure not Wendy's or mcdonalds. Think of it as a cleaner steak-n-shake with better food. 

The burgers really are pretty darn good. Not the best I've had but better than say 5 Guys. I like their fries as they are really thin a crispy. Their shakes are very good as well. 

The only catch is the price. It's around $10-11 for a burger a fries. That is a problem as I can go to say a place like Kickstand and get a better burger for about the same money. 

Also at this location the parking is not ideal so be prepared for that. A bit of a pain to get in and out. 

So yeah 3 stars. Maybe 3.5 but that's it. I wouldn't drive out if of my way but if you're in the area worth a try."}
{"text":"28 mins still waiting for order... no apologies and staff running around like they are lost! Manager looks like she is trying to do it all and worst part is they are not telling people in line how long wait is!"}
{"text":"I first had Smash Burger in the Newark airport and it was awesome! So i thought it would be at least as good in the Vegas store.
Not so much :(
I read some yelp that talked about the food being greasy.  My burger was a little greasy, but my fries were seriously drowning!!!
I pulled them out of their cradle and they were laying in at least a third a cup of grease. I am thinking they used a ladel to pull them out of the flyer.
The only redeamers were the service was above and beyond and malt was probably the best i have had.
Come on Vegas Smash Burger....time to step up. We r being showed up by Jersey!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The place looked like a tornado hit it. There were no clean tables to sit at. Trash was overflowing in the bathrooms. The fountain area was disgusting. The floors had good and trash on them. Told the cashier there were no clean tables to sit at. She just shrugged and took the next order. I had to clean my own table. Others had to clean their tables too. Food took extea long to arrive. Where's management? Oh, she was working the cash register. Said she was to busy taking orders to get anything done and they were shorthanded. Tacos for lunch, I guess"}
{"text":"I want to give this a great review because I love all the healthier choices offered along with the not so healthy but delicious options like beer & burgers. My experience at this location was less than stellar. The cashier chick who took our order lost her cool when we swiped our credit card before the order was complete (like almost every other credit card process I've ever experienced). I was taken back at her reaction which was super unwarranted, it simply meant we had to swipe again when the order was complete. 

My food was ok but the salad had too much dressing. I should've asked for it on the side. To top off the disappointing experience, we were surrounded by fruit flies while we dined."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Grilled Avocado Chicken Club & Smashfries! I have to admit though, that sometimes the chicken is dry but this has only happened a few times & I'm there at least once a week.  The service is always excellent & the restaurant is always clean!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers. Great taste, buns are awesome. Staff very polite to compliment their great service.

I am not a fan of their fries, as they are quite thin. That however, is a personal preference thing, as I prefer wedge cut fries period.

I would receive recommend this place for anyone who loves burgers, and wants more than you average burger joint."}
{"text":"I love this place me and my girlfriend come here often we usually get the classic big burger with the smash fries and there both really good this is one of my favorite burger joints in vegas"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the Black Bean Burger. The manger was very friendly, and in spite of me showing up an hour before they close, the place ran out of beans, but the manager gave us smash bucks for future visits, and free drink to gain my business for future references. overall, a very pleasant experience and will do business again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here and had to go from here several times; all with great results.  Today, I had a chicken burger to go.  While I was eating, I noticed it tasted funny and gummy.  Then I looked at the chicken..it was raw!!! Needless to say I now have food poisoning.  Warning to all --beware, if you're eating chicken from here; only eat it at the restaurant."}
{"text":"You never get your order made correct when you order online. I dont know how they seem to manage to mess up ever order we get but we wont be getting food from them anymore. Waste of money and time."}
{"text":"We found Smashburger to be efficiently run, offering wholesome choices and not precooked meats.  The food was delicious and the service was great."}
{"text":"amazing haagon doz milkshake and awesome burgers... i highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We order some burger with fries and drinks, then went to wash my hands by time  i was out my food was there. It was so fast and there was great service too. We'll be going back in near future."}
{"text":"This is my first time going to Smashburger  and it's going to be the last time as well This place was filthy and found a hair in my burger and I ordered a kids meal for my daughter have a hot dog and I want to share the hot dog with no bun because they didn't pulled the buns out to the morning and they were frozen"}
{"text":"One of the employees was very rude and told my husband \" eating a salad- a guy like you doesn't look like he would a salad\" implying my husband was over weight."}
{"text":"Burgers were good but took about 25 to 30 min to get the food.  Place wasn't busy either.  Family of 4 but only 2 1/2 got food served after 20 minutes and then waited another 10 minutes to get the missing fries and the 4th meal.  Server seemed lost or new and even though the food was being placed on the counter it took her awhile to figure out what was what."}
{"text":"This place is really nice inside but the food is nothing to brag about. The burger is very greasy and the fries are too skinny.I agree with others,real fries would be much better."}
{"text":"Oh so good!  In vegas for vacation and decided one day to have a heavy lunch before hitting the strip; this sounded like it would fit the bill - and it did!

I had a classic this time and can't wait to try some of the others."}
{"text":"The staff was very attentive. I took a long time looking at the menu, but as soon as I turned to order, the girl at the register was ready to take my order, asked what else I wanted, what size for my drink and fries, and rang me up quickly. After sitting down, once I got my food, the girl asked if I needed anything else, and within just a few minutes, one of the workers(whom I assume was a manager) came by my table and asked how everything was tasting. Quick question, not a huge interruption, which was nice. As I was typing this review, he noticed me not eating and asked if I wanted a box. I said no, but the fact he was perceptive enough to ask that question meant a lot. Great service."}
{"text":"Went in for an online order.  Burgers, shakes, and one drink.  The food was done a few minutes late, we were handed a bag but the shakes and drink were missing.  They also deleted the order and then had to look it up again which took a while.  Finally someone starts making the shakes when the store manager ordered her to stop and go to the register instead, leaving them sitting there unmade.  By the time we got the entire order it was 15 minutes later.  The food by then was ice cold even though we live less than 5 minutes away.  And the final insult, all the shakes were wrong(all vanilla although none were ordered that way.  Very disappointed in this location.  Manager extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"The good:
I wanted to love this place so badly. I heard about it from a friend and had no idea there was one in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend and I went the day I realized (today) and I ordered a burger that was on a pretzel bun with BBQ sauce, guacamole, onion straws, and bacon.  Food was delicious and the fries were everything I love about fries!  Shoestring, rosemary, just delicious!  The service was alright, but not very fast if you're in a rush. Nothing tasted off. 

The bad:
After consuming my lunch I went to a book sale and then made my way home. About 4 hours after eating I started getting very nauseous. This was the only thing I had eaten today other than a small amount of dark chocolate. I ended up in the bathroom with the worst indigestion I've had in a long time. I wanted to like this place so badly but after making me sick I don't really want to come back again. Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Definitely wasnt the worst burger ive had in Charlotte(Braswell's Sandwich Salvage).  Not quite sure what to think of the smash fries, glad I had the trusty old ranch to help.  

At the end of the day I will try it again buy likely wont frequent the place too much."}
{"text":"Quality control @lake mead location is abysmal. On multiple occasions, sandwiches have been served without add ons that were charged for, and the sides tasted like they had been sitting in a bucket of lukewarm grease for an hour. On top of that, our shakes were less than 2/3 full. Do yourself a favor and avoid this location and hit the more reliable Sahara location, or better yet, just go to Create."}
{"text":"Due to their competing locations across the street from each other, the choice is Smash or INO. I'd go smash for the wild difference. Classic burger: INO. Something unusual and very good: Smash. 

Good prices, friendly staff, and clean clean clean. I would defiantly go back for a Sin City (hold the egg). Rosemary fries are unusual but very good. No ketchup needed.

Kids menu items are big. 5 and 7 yr olds could've shared one burger and fry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place! The Oreo milkshakes are awesome as well. Also try the sin city burger!"}
{"text":"I give this all stars because the food was amazing, but it was the presentation that did it for me, it not only tasted good but the way they plated the food it wasn't just thrown on a plate."}
{"text":"Ok so I know everyone loves this place but I don't get the big deal!?! Yes the burgers are good and they have fried pickles but its not better than In N Out! Plus its freaking expensive!!! I recommend going just to say you've tried it and then go somewhere else like In N Out or Freddy's Custard and Steakburgers!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out a couple of weeks ago, and I have to save, I found a new burger spot that I enjoy. 

Here are the positives:
* Marketing and Identity package is a great. I love the look and feel of the place.
* You can get three different size burgers, which is fantastic! 
* You get a choice of buns...Awesome
* They have chicken and salads on the menu...a burger joint with healthy alternatives...fantastic!
* Flavored Mayos....yes!!!!
* Mustard!!!
* Milkshakes!!!

Because I am in love with Chipotle, I had a regular burger, on a chipotle bun and substituted Chipotle mayo instead of mustard.  Dave ordered the big burger, as it came. We shared a basket of the garlic and rosemary sweet potato fries and a NutterButter shake. 

First off, if you have read my other reviews, you know I am a critical fan of sweet potato fries. These were excellent, and I did not have the desire to dip them in honey or anything else. Great twist of the flavor with the garlic and rosemary. (Even though sweet potato fries are really meant to be dipped in honey). Next, I LOVED my burger. The size was good, it was prepared well, it wasn't dry, and I loved the flavor of the chipotle. I also tasted Dave's, and it was good. He got the All American. 

The negative. The service. We were  1/2 way done with our meal when I went looking for our shake. They said they couldn't find us, even though when they dropped off our food we asked about the shake. The shake was in the cooler. After we finally got it, it was great."}
{"text":"Smashburger looks like a better-appointed Chipotle. Melamine, cool colors and shiny surfaces in abundance. The order takers were very helpful, spotting our BOGO coupon and asking us if it was our first time and suggesting all kinds of add-ons we could 
try to make our experience a special one. No criticism there whatsoever - hey, we even threw them a couple of bucks as a thank you, even though I generally frown on places which expect a tip that don't offer full table-side service.

Our experience was a special one, but sadly for the wrong reasons.

First, let me tell you what we ordered: My vegetarian wife opted for the Spicy Baja Black Bean Burger, accompanied by Smashfries (fries tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic) and a side of fried pickles. I went for the Mushroom Swiss Grilled Chicken which comes loaded with garlic sautéed mushrooms, aged Swiss cheese and mayo all sitting atop an egg bun. For my side I decided upon the Chili Cheese Fries, a buck more than my wife's choice.

When the food was delivered I was disappointed to see it all came out in hideous stainless steel wire baskets, each item separated from the table by little more than a thin layer of wax paper. Now, I HATE wire food baskets at the best of times (it is the ONLY thing I despise about Red Robin's otherwise top notch modus operandi) but these were a complete joke. Except neither of us laughed. The sides of the basket - also wire-framed - were half-an-inch tall meaning that when the food was served it was already dripping grease out onto our table. 

Things didn't get any better when trying to slice our food up, the wire-bottomed trays making the buns more difficult to cut than anyone sane person should have to bother with. The upshot was that the table ended up wearing much of our food. Worse than that was that grease oozed out of the side of my wife's burger, slithered across the table and onto a new pair of pants she had bought just the day before. Dear restaurateurs.... just what the hell is wrong with proper plates?

My wife said that what she could actually eat of her burger - it was very VERY messy and falling apart  - was the considerable palate pleaser, the right mix of both spice and texture. However, for all its culinary plusses she did leave almost half of it behind, her attempts to eat curtailed by an inability to be able to cut the bun properly. Her Smashfries were viewed suspiciously and considered merely OK - I think both of us were expecting something a little more than oil-drenched McD-esque frozen fries, possibly something hand-cut with a real, y'know, potato flavor to them?!

My chicken burger was a disgrace. Nothing short of. The grilled chicken patty in my bun was a floppy mess and tasted of absolutely nothing. The egg bun overpowered everything else, the cheese flavor unrecognizable and the mushrooms appearing neither fresh nor appealing. My chili cheese fries were also a disappointment, the chili failing to fire up the fries in any way whatsoever. Was it from a can?

So, in terms of food, they earn a mere 2 points. I can't imagine we'll ever be back. It was just too messy and too 'meh' to make the effort.

However, I have awarded them 3 stars instead of just 2 for one simple - and some may say ludicrous - reason. Their bathrooms. 

OK, so you expect the bathrooms in a new establishments to be bright, clean and sparkly and Smashburger's certainly fulfilled that ideal. However, where they get the extra star from is the locks they put on the doors. No, I am not making that up. 

14 years I have been in America and for all of those fourteen years I have spent time waiting outside a bathroom wondering if it _is_ actually engaged or have been inside the bathroom cowering with anxiety as person after person tries the door whilst I am.... well, erm.... whilst why I am 'pushing to make room', if you get my drift. In all those 14 years I have never.... NEVER .... seen a loo door with a lock which on the outside shows an \"in use/vacant\" slider to immediately inform other customers of the actual status of that bathroom. Such locks are prevalent (possibly even 'the law'?) in Europe and it's never failed to consternate me whilst I have been living this side of the pond that American builders, plumbing contractors and businesses can't adopt something similar to make everybody's life just that little bit easier and less stressful.

So, 2 stars for the less than average food & presentation plus 1 bonus star for the toilet door!"}
{"text":"I decided to update my review and added 2 stars since the burgers were really good and they remade both my burger as well as my husband's since he's was going to be gross by the time he got back home. Still annoyed they didn't remake the shake that was basically flavored milk.. Won't be getting a shake from here again.. But will be back for the burgers!"}
{"text":"Smashburger... more like smash wallet! We paid over $30 for a burger that kept sliding apart from the copious amount of grease it had. I would rather had a mcdouble from McDonald's (and no McDonald's did not pay me to write that) all in all never going back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I get the onion strings and either the small smash urgent or the mushroom burger, yummy!  The sweet potato fries are great too!"}
{"text":"They have awesome smash fries, and the burgers ain't bad. I cant say i like the prices, but they will do when you want an upgrade from regular fast food chains."}
{"text":"Our family ordered online for pick up. Fresh food and on time as promised when ordering. The chicken sandwich, fries and kids meal were delicious! The only sad part about this meal was our bacon cheeseburger. The flavor was completely missing, and the meat itself was really small."}
{"text":"What a great find!! Best burger place in town. Lots of options, everything tastes fresh and good. Went for dinner with some friends and for lunch before some shopping.  I will definitely go back & recommend Smash burger."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good.  Got myself the sin city burger with sweet potato fries while the bf had the buffalo and blue cheese, the smash fries, and a brewski.    Not gonna lie, it was pretty delish.  Staff here was also a plus.  Much nicer than the one of Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Excellent burger! I had a classic smashburger and order of smash fries. The burger was very juicy and tasty and the toppings were fresh. Not the BEST burger I've ever had, but pretty dang good. The smashfries are very good- but a very strong flavor. My fiancé didn't care for the fries, she liked the regular fries with sea salt instead. 

I guess my ONLY complaint is the price. A tad on the high side. (2) smashburgers, 1 order of reg smashfries, 1 order of reg sea salt fries and a reg drink came to $18. 

Still- it's definitely worth going back. Fresh ingredients. Tasty 100% angus beef burgers. Tons of options and toppings. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"For a recently opened restaurant the food and service were good.

I had a coupon from previous visits to other Smashburgers, and using it was a breeze, unlike other new restaurants. 

I have celiac disease and need the gluten-free bun and gluten-free preparation. Even though it was a busy time, the staff was careful about my food. That said, the milkshake had a too large amount of ice and the avocados on my burger weren't ripe. Otherwise, my burger was enjoyable. 

My friend ordered a salad and enjoyed it. She cannot eat onions and asked for them not to be on her salad, but it came with onions. Pretty easy fix, though.

Overall both my friend and I enjoyed our experience at Smashburger. I think the restaurant will continue to improve as the crazy busyness of the first days wears off and a few improvements are made."}
{"text":"I Order burger and watered 35 min. I went to see what's going on why my order didn't came thru. 
I'm been told that they missed my order it will be another 20 min because they have to reorder in system or they can refund my money back.
I took my full refund back and Manager didn't even said sorry.
Very poor customer service"}
{"text":"This is an outstanding place. The food was ready fast and delicious. The price was good for places in the area. On top of all I loved the costumer service! They checked on each of the tables more than once and handed out coupons to each costumer. This was a truly great experience and I would recommend anyone come here. Thank you for an outstanding time."}
{"text":"This visit was great service. My first visit to any smashburger. Everyone was friendly. The burger was really good. Someone from staff asked how i was doing 3 times during my 25 min visit. Not only did they ask if i needed anything, it seemed sincere. Not the cheapest burger, but,  did i mention the burger was great.

I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there mid afternoon today and stood at the cash register 3-5 minutes.  2 employees definitely saw me but nobody ever acknowledged me.  This is basic stuff people!  I turned around and walked out and will never return."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! This place is plagued by inconsistent food and servce. My family and I have dined here a half dozen times since it opened and have had mixed results. When it's good it's really good, but if you can't be consistent then what can you be? We ate there for dinner last night. The guy behind the counter put us on hold while he made some shakes. He was also the one to deliver our food. Since we had dined there several times before, we knew that the onion straws and the fried pickles came with sauces. There were no sauces served so we asked him for the accompanying sauces. He looked a little frazzled and said he would be right back with them. My wife took a nibble at my daughters fries and they were cold. Not even warm but cold. The server returned with only the onion straw sauce. We reminded him that we wanted the fried pickle sauce also and let him know that my daughter's fries were cold. He tried to make light of the situation and said how cold fries were no good. He left to go get the sauce and some hot fries we assumed. As we dug into our burgers, we noticed that the onion straws were not their usual crispy, hot selves. These were luke warm, oily and limp. The plan was to let the server know this when he returned with the fried pickle sauce and the hot fries. He never returned. Sure, we saw him floating around the restaurant which wasn't busy. Poor service & inconsistent food are never a good combination. The thing that really sucked is that my wife and daughter were so looking foward to having dinner there and they left disappointed."}
{"text":"Descent burger. Lots of flavor. Goes good with the sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"After a lackluster first try at a Smashburger in Overland Park, Kansas (yes, Kansas got a Smashburger before Charlotte did!) my husband and I decided to brave the Smash again, this time at the only location in NC, in Stonecrest.  (Though I'm told a new one near the Carolina Place Mall is expected soon.) 

I \"liked\" Smashburger on Facebook prior to going, so we could get a free burger with the purchase of a \"Mex\" burger/chicken sandwich which is new. 

When we got to the restaurant on a Thursday evening, it was pretty busy-- maybe 70%.  I was told by the very helpful cashier on Friday and Saturdays, the line is practically out the door. He also told me our food would be out within 5-7 minutes, which was right on the dot. Appreciated, young man. 

The decor is clean and bright, minimalistic red and white...but more modern than the red and white of Five Guys.  The presentation of the food is nice in it's wire basket and clean ketchup and mustard caddies. 

The Mex chicken sandwich was excellent.  Super thin chicken, cheese, avocado, red onions and a \"mexican\" style bun.  I bit into it and thought \"...oooh fresh!\" While I wouldn't call the chicken juicy (I'm a dark meat kinda gal, and to me anything white meat isn't juicy) but the toppings and sauces and everything really came together. 

My black bean burger too was nice and flavorful.  This isn't like the Bad Daddy's deep fried black bean patty, but a griddled one, which yes, falls apart as you eat it, but I think it's a nice option. 

Jimmy D...oh yes, I concur about these veggie frites.  They're definitely not crispy.  I was told they were flash fried veggies, so I assumed they'd be like the ones at PF Changs...those crispy string beans.  They were more like...uh, yeah, what Jimmy D said!  Limp and kind of like if boiled veggies got sprayed in oil. It was hard to keep the dipping ranch sauce on them they were so greasy and slippery. 

The house fries are rosemary which I like-- and nice and shoestring.  

A nice boy came by after our meal to take away our wire baskets that once held our food.  

Bottom line, I thought the prices were pretty in-line with a casual fast burger joint, and I was pleased with the layout of the menu with toppings and options.  Just please, do something about those strange, strange veggie....limp things."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick burger.  I like all of my options and the shakes.  Service has always been good here and they cater to their guests.  Important these days when people could go eat anywhere they want."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place but I've got to admit I don't get it.  I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and sweet potato fries and the burger was lacking in flavor and was extremely greasy  and same thing with the fries. This will my last visit here. For my money I would much rather go to Habit Burger."}
{"text":"Ok first let me say I don't eat red meat so my rating is not for their traditional burger. With that said I AM OBSESSED with their chicken sandwich. It's literally the best grilled chicken sandwich I've ever had!!! I swear. My entire order is always correct and delicious! Grilled chicken sandwich w grilled onions, cheddar, pickles, tomato, lettuce, and smashsauce. Sweet potato fries. And a vanilla malt...yuuuuum! This place is going to make me fat and happy. Go there eat that and like it...cuz I said so."}
{"text":"Stopped in this Smashburger while on vacation. We were immediately greeted by the stores manager, David. He was very attentive and helpful, and treated us like family. The restaurant was clean, service was fast, and our burgers were great. I would especially recommend the sweet potato Smash fries."}
{"text":"I ordered a meal to-go from a different location across town and didn't realize until I was close to the Alma School location that the burger I received was completely different from what was on my receipt. I called the Alma School location to see if they could help rectify the situation and manager Matt told me to come on in and that he would take care of it -- and he did! Matt was so helpful and nice about the whole situation! He remade my order to match the original receipt, gave me a cup for water while I waited, followed up with the manager of the original location, and was so kind about the whole thing! This is the type of customer service I would hope to receive in this situation. Matt, thank you for your help today and for your outstanding service! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't get the reviews.

Awesome iced tea-  that deserves one star on its own.

Its a fresh, quality ingredients on a decent not great burger.  The burger itself reminded me of a Freddie's burger.  I didn't feel weighed down or cruddy after eating it. I wish they had potatoe buns although the egg bun was pretty good.  I would go back for 10 bucks I got a burger, fry, an a drink.  It just depends on what type of burger you want is this place better than in and out, five guys, or Wendy's probably not-  taste wise but ingredient quality I think so-

Fries ehh nothing special about them-  more soggy than crispy but that's not a bad thing."}
{"text":"Was so not happy with the Arizona burger with habenaro cheese. Spice level was about a 2 out of 10 was dry. First and last time were eating there. Family of 4 2 adults and 2 children total came to $34"}
{"text":"I gave them 3 stars out of sheer appreciation for military on Memorial Day. The free concept made my burger a little better. But their advertising is pretty bad and their availability for ingredients is not great. I had to check out online what to expect, seeing thatmany metropolitan cities have a Smash Burger, I found that the San Diego smash burger looked most appealing, but when I tried to order it in Las Vegas, they didn't have a clue. Their centralized website should give the locations a source to look up that info. I mean, I can understand, for example, if Boston had a clam chowder smash, I wouldn't expect Phoenix to have one, but simple things like cilantro should be available. Their gimmick for smashing their burger pinching out the fat  is not bad; I like to get a bite of meat with every bite. I'm not crazy about their atmosphere, but to each their own."}
{"text":"We were on the way home on a weekday evening and needed to find a place for dinner that was still open. I saw we were coming up on a Smashburger and since we'd never been decided to give it a shot. The cashier was super nice and explained what he liked best and helped us decide on dinner. We both had burgers and fries and thought they were good, typical fast casual better than average burger. I'd go back if I was in the area and needed a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"$10 down the drain! I tried the big smash classic burger and sweet potato smash fries. The burger was larger than the bun which made it difficult to eat, very sloppy. The patty was salty and greasy. The \"sweet\" potato fries were very salty and covered with rosemary, terrible taste! I had to pass 4 tables to find a clean one. An employee came by and asked how the meal was, I gave him my honest opinion. He offered me 3 future comps, I declined and told him that I won't be coming back! Hard to believe all the craze over this place. 5 guys puts them to shame and that it not saying much! Truly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to one other SmashBurger - near 24th Street & Baseline - so this is my second visit to this chain.  

The negatives.

The setup of this particular  location is terrible.  The entrance and exits are completely out of whack.  Get rid of the wall that is directly in front of the door when you enter, please!!   The place needs to be redesigned, excepting the back half of the restaurant is  not changeable by any restaurant standards, it's narrow, dark and not a good eating atmosphere.  If nothing else, they need to change the lighting in the place and give it a MUCH different ambiance.  
But let's get past that and get to the food (still, the setup of a restaurant can greatly increase or decrease your appetite and your enjoyment of the food you are eating). 

Burgers and fries, they go hand in hand. You don't really have one without the other.
So, the fries are also pretty bad.  Unbelievably greasy.  To the point the grease drips off the fries and into the bottom of the cup they are served in and pooling.  Fingers covered with grease.  The fries are skinny and short. I don't mind the skinny part, I do mind the short part.  Hard to dip into ketchup.  I was in the semi trying to just eat the fries and constantly using a napkin to get the grease off of my fingers.  

I ordered an Arizona burger. Now I'm going into the positive mode. That thing was awesome.  I don't know what kind of bun that is, but it's very good.  The burger was a perfect blend of various ingredients and it was delicious.  If the burger hadn't been as  good as it is, I would have given this place a 2 star rating.  I did have them add grilled onions to mine, but even without them it still would have been a very good burger.  

That's it.  This location has great burgers."}
{"text":"The food is great and the people are nice, but an online order placed 45 before my arrival still took another 35 minutes to finish my order. That's 1hr 20min.

Many others appeared to be waiting both for dine-in and take-out.

Damn disappointing.

Update: had to go back for the shake they forgot. That makes it a solid 1-1/2 hours for two burgers and fries. 
And, they were cold. 
Not lukewarm...cold.

I could've bought, eaten, and passed a McDonald's meal in that time."}
{"text":"The prices are a bit high...after all, it's burgers...but, this is by far my favorite place to get a burger. (And I do love burgers). Juicy, cheesy, great tasting patty, and the ingredients (lettuce, tomato, avocado) always look and taste fresh! It's like they grow their avocados in the back! Hah. The fries are just okay for me. They have a good taste, but they are the thin shoestring fries that often are crunchy (I like soft, easily smushed fries). Regular soft drinks, but they do have some teas and a few local and domestic beers too. But it's still a fast food feel. And they bring your food to the table and clean it up. Plain and simple atmosphere. They have booths and tables, and outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Eh, I didn't really feel this place.  I guess they smash burgers or something?  Apparently that makes them better? Who knows.

I ordered the avocado club burger because ... avocado.  But, of course, they were stingy with the avocado.  I hate you!  Then, to top it off, the meat was all dry like it had been overcooked.  

I will say that the smash fries are delicious. The rosemary, olive oil and garlic seasonings really make these fries addicting.  However, I am not going to go back to a place just because I like the fries!

Step it up, yo."}
{"text":"I ordered the 1/2 lb. BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, smashfries and a chocolate shake. The burger was real good, with the patty peeking out of the edges of the bun, tangy sauce and a decent amount of bacon. The fries were good, however, the portion was smaller than I expected. The chocolate shake was ok as well. If your looking for a good burger, I would suggest giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Fried egg on any burger is phenomenal.  The nice thing is that you can go with their creations or create your own masterpiece.  Las Vegas definitely needed another burger joint and this is it."}
{"text":"Buffalo fries were very flavorful just a little to salty for me. The manager on duty was very accommodating and we will be back."}
{"text":"Update : manager walked by as we were leaving. She asked how was everything.  We told her of our experience. She refunded our money. 
Thank you Betty.

The worst service my family and I have ever had. The one person behind the cash register continued to make milkshakes while the line  went out the door. Once shakes were done, her and another employee had to figure out who ordered them.  No one is taking orders at this time. We watched my daughter's salad sit waiting to be picked up. Our burgers were served. He continued to scroll on the computer trying to figure out where to serve salad. My son had ordered a milkshake that he didn't get. When we finally got the servers attention to ask when it will be ready, he brings us a melted milkshake in a to go cup! $5 for this? Also,  my daughter asked for a knife for her salad. She was given a plastic one and was told the dished weren't clean. $30 for crap  food  and horrible service.!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Sweetpotato smash fries are awesome! Milkshakes are hand made w Hagan Daz ice cream. Salted Carmel is to die for. The buns are amazing."}
{"text":"Went for the first time the other day and I'm addicted. Fries and a regular-sized burger will run you about $10, but it's absolutely worth it. The sweet potato fries were perfect and I'm still having day dreams about the burger days later. Perfectly greasy and flavorful patty, perfectly melted cheese, and that bun - the carb addict in me couldn't be happier. Can't wait to go back, and I'll definitely be getting a milkshake next time... you can get it in Nutter Butter flavor. This was a thing I didn't know I needed, but now I really need it.

Oh yeah, and the service was great. Everyone was cheerful and friendly. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting in 15 minutes. I had asked the lady at the cash register if they could please be quick. They made my burger within 6 minutes and handed it to me quickly. I was not  late to my meeting. Very happy! !"}
{"text":"Definitely impressed with this place.  Just happened to see it off 32nd and I pulled in.  We both ordered the large Calgary burger and it was big and juicy and loaded with flavor!  It's a pretty messy burger but definitely worth it in the end.  I love the large selection of possible side dishes for cheap prices (2.99-3.99) instead of just trying to modify some fries like most joints.  I also liked how they bring your food to your table instead of barking out numbers.  I will definitely be stopping by any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"SO HORRIBLE!! Its a cool idea but the food was gross. I couldnt even eat half of my burger! It was SO salty and i freaking love salt. Just couldnt even finish it it was so bad.  Maybe it was just the type of burger i had (BBQ Bacon and cheddar), but the others in my office (we ordered 12 burgers for our night shift lol!) found it the same. And the fries were not great either and the deep fried pickles were so so so salty and soggy. Oh and its all a-la-carte as well.... i mean jsut make a combo! 
All in all did not enjoy this place one bit."}
{"text":"Damn good burgers, amazing oreo milkshakes, and yummy seasoned 'smash fries' with herbs and olive oil. 

Ingredients were fresh, juicy, and not too greasy. My tummy was one happy tummy (even better: despite being junk food, it didn't actually upset my stomach, which is incredibly rare and a real tribute to how fresh & good Smashburger's stuff is).

My only gripes are that

 a) the veggies offered are over salted. I'm admittedly not much of a salt fan, but the haystick onions and the carrot/bean side were, for me, completely uneatable because of the amount of salt involved. Sad face.

b) it's a pain in the ass to get there and back without a car. Luckily, I can probably talk friends with cars into eating there with me/ driving me considering how good the food is.

Although I'd love Smashburger forever if they wanted to open up a location right next to an LRT station!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Smashburger but not today.   They must of had their \"B\" team running things today.  My daughters kids meal (grilled cheese) came after we had gotten our food.  The sandwiched was \"grilled \"  but the cheese was not melted.  Also with kids meals now if you want milk or juice they charge you extra.  
Their soda machine did not seem to be working properly either or was not cleaned properly.  We tried the coke, diet coke and coke zero and each one of them had a musty taste to it.  The soda was not drinkable.  We informed the girl who took our order ( she was wearing a badge that said certified trainer)  and said she would tell a manager.  Manager never came over to the table nor were we offered anything else to drink.  We basically had to throw our drinks away. ($5.00).  Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I've been to other smashburger locations. This one is definitely my favorite! People here are always friendly and helpful, which makes the delicious burgers and fries more enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"Food came out really fast, fresh and hot. Terrell is an excellent manager here. Interacts with customers and gave a military discount from ID card unlike the Smashburger on 24th street & Baseline. They expect you to be in uniform. Live closer to 24th street but rather come back to this location!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Burgers are always delicious & everyone that works here are so friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Amazing burger. I have had the Classic with fried egg and the Arizona burger. They were both amazing! Very juicy, extremely fresh toppings, and the buns were out of this world. The fried egg was so crispy and delicious, I will never be able to eat a regular burger again without thinking about putting some of these fried eggs on top.

The Smash Fries are delicious as well. The ones at the bottom of the basket are always the tastiest. They give you a lot though so if I go with someone I always try to share between two people.

Their prices are a little bit steep but if you share an order of fries you can keep it at about $10 a person., which really isn't bad.

They also get points for having sliced lemons by the pop machine, lol.

There isn't many seats inside but they also put tables outside so if it isn't too hot seating usually isn't a problem.

Service is always wonderful. The manager on duty always comes by to see if everything tastes good.

The only complaint I have is that I want to try all the regional burgers from other areas, especially the San Diego burger, but I can't :( . I think a Smashburger road trip is in order. ;)"}
{"text":"We drove by this location and stopped in here.  I'm a long time Smashburger fan and this was a huge disappointment.  we stopped in late on Saturday night and the chicken was paper thin and no rosemary on the shmash fries.  The best thing was the malt.  won't go back here."}
{"text":"I always love the food but the customer service sucked. I came in 45 minutes before they closed and all of the employees looked like they hated their lives. Taryn especially. Definitely not impressed. While three of the employees sat in a booth on their phones, I watched a cricket jump across a few tables. I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ bacon cheddar burger and it was pretty good, but I expected more out of it for a $6 burger. The smash fries weren't the best fries I've ever had either. I would like to go again but maybe bring a coupon or something!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go again today...disappointed again. Ordered 3 smash kids meals, added bacon and organic apple juices. Also 2 sin city burgers and added avocado on both. 1 buffalo bleu cheese burger, and a chocolate Oreo shake for there while I waited. Total was $50. The shake was awesome and by the time I finished it my order was ready. Get home to anthem, handing out the kids their meals and notice there's no organic apple juice. I called the store and was told that I was supposed to get it myself out of a cooler near the front. It would be nice if an employee would have informed me. The store refunded me for a kids meal and a juices. I get off the phone with the store and start to dig into the sin city burgers and there's no avocado. Really? Just really disappointing...again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service, first time in and the girl at the counter had no personality. We were there August 4th at 3:30p. The diet coke was out, we weren't told until after we bought our drinks. The food is over rated, we won't be going back! KH"}
{"text":"The veggie burger was gross! Not worth having again, the fries were good."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite before cocktail hour.  Smashburger's fries did the trick in a pinch!  Hot, crunchy, salty - I couldn't ask for more.  Friendly and quick service!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The burger was greasy and the meat, flavorless. I opted for the Arizona, so the only saving grace were the semi-spicy toppings. The staff definitely doesn't look like they enjoy being there and as another yelper said, the decor reminds me more of a carwash than a burger joint. For the price it costs to go there I'd definitely recommend taking your money and driving to the In-n-out nearby. Heck for a few dollars more you can head over to Four Peaks and have a REALLY good burger."}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend here the other night and it was amazing (a little cold inside), and we loved it. The Smash Fries were out of this world and the burgers were great! Then to top it off we had some amazing milkshakes. Thank you to the staff for the great night and great food."}
{"text":"Good quality burgers! You won't be disappointed. The avocado club is my favorite. Try the sweet potato fries too, very good."}
{"text":"I'm a new fan of Smashburger!  I tried the Arizona Smashburger with Smashfries. The double burger was awesome and it came with guacamole, jalepenos, chipotle mayo, habanero cheese and what ever veggies you want all on a chiptole bun. It was YUM! Their Smashfries are fries tossed with olive oil and rosemary. Some people don't like them but I thought this combo of seasoning was very good and different from the \"norm\".  

This place is very clean and the peeps that work their are very friendly.  Look forward to going back and trying something different."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Good chicken. For some reason my BBQ bacon chicken didn't come with the shoestring onions even though it says so on the menu board. (Happened on 2 occasions). Still all food was very good."}
{"text":"I was definitely impressed with the burgers at this location. The drawback is the price. $15 and change for a couple of burgers, without fries.....ouch!!!"}
{"text":"Usually I love this location. But....I got a super downer vibe from Izabel , who was probably the most miserable employee I have ever encountered.  I guess she doesn't like her job , because I am quite pleasant to say the least.  I hope she just had a hangover that day & normally shes a really a nice lady (but I doubt it).My good mood plummeted as she rolled her eyes and scowled as I asked a couple of simple questions. As a bonus she basically threw my food basket on the table with such conviction I jumped out of my skin.    Otherwise, the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Nice clean atmosphere for a chain restaurant. Stop by this week and had a really good bacon cheeseburger cooked just right. Their French fries come in many different flavors and I recommend the buffalo style if you want to try something new! the price of the meal was fair at around $8 for the burger with extra fixings on it and the service was absolutely outstanding! I had several staff members stop by to ask how my meal was and if they could do anything else for me. first class! I will be back."}
{"text":"Burgers aren't too wimpy, great taste even without the bun! Fries are tossed in olive oil, basil, and garlic......so good! Staff was nice and long necks are a $1.50!!! Will def go back!"}
{"text":"It's a good burger, however the manager ken has horrible customer relation skills. I would another employee interact with the customers."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. My smash fries didn't have much on them, tasted almost like reg fries. And the girl who brought us our food was rude when my girlfriend asked for more mayo."}
{"text":"huge portions, fast service and great atmosphere made this an excellent choice for lunch with colleagues on a rainy day."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good. But tonight, fries were old and barely warm, and my bun was old. Sad to say but for this price I will never be back, I shouldn't have to send a 10 dollar burger back. Just sad food."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from my office, convenient right? Well maybe if there weren't other burger choices. Have tried the burgers and onion strings, both of which are overly salty, and the onions extremely soggy with grease. 

The layout of the place is also really awkward. You come in and order and them wait for your food....except the is no where to wait? You kind of stand between their expediter, others waiting and right next to diners. They need a much better system. Prices also seem a little high...$10+ for a burger, fries & drink."}
{"text":"Just had some great burgers with my family , what made this meal even better was the amazing customer service that we just received this evening. I will continue to recommend this place to everyone I know. Every single one of the employees here are very professional and courteous. Thanks again"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was really good!  I had the avocado club chicken sandwich and the smash fries, they were both good.  The smash fries are interesting, they are seasoned with rosemary, garlic, n olive oil.
The only thing was that there wasn't enough places to sit.  I was there at lunch time on a tuesday and they were super busy.  Maybe this will change when the newness wears off."}
{"text":"Overpriced, ordinary, and greasy. Not even the kind that you know is bad for you but you just can't help yourself. The kind that IS bad and you kick yourself for shelling out the extra dough."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their sweet potato smashfries are totally delicious and I am so addicted to their buffalo chicken sandwich that I have not been able to order anything else for the past 3 visits.

They do have yummy but pricey milkshakes if that is your thing.  However, what I love most is the fried pickles.  It is hard finding a place that does fried pickles much less does them well (they must be chips, not spears).

A nice atmosphere, good service and decent food.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"SmashBurger is my absolute FAVORITE.  I think it's equal to In-N-out, if not better.  I suggest the Sin CIty Burger.  WORTH THE PAY!!!!"}
{"text":"So the food is whatever. Their customer service sucks. They are known for there smash fries so we got to order and 4 HOURS BEFORE CLOSING they are all out of smash fries....OK whatever we still wanna eat. My boyfriend ordered the new cowboy burger and what do you know they are all out of haystack onions. Thats fine we still order our food. While we are waiting we are informed now they are all out of bacon which is on each of our 3 burgers/sandwiches. No my boyfriend is annoyed 3 things missing from his meal so he wanted a refund for his and while Im getting the refund the cook, who made the burger because of their lack of communication, os starting me down lookin all pissed. And as we walk away we heard one of the managers mumble \"oh well let them leave with out their burger\" this is the most unprofessional place I have ever been in vegas. I will never be returning here."}
{"text":"Brandon was amazing. He had such amazing customer service and was very personable. Everyone was fast and friendly and I enjoy eating at this location."}
{"text":"Actually had the spinach salad with crispy chicken - delicious! My wife had the burger and she said it was very good!"}
{"text":"The \"kids\" working at this location are either half dead or really have no concept of customer service. First and last time I will ever go in there.....I'll stick with 5 guys.... They are very well trained employees always ready to serve and the burgers taste much better!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Burger!! I've been there me & my sister; we had sin city burger & original smash.. Beer & coke.. Cost almost 20 bucks..

Very tasty and perfect for meat lovers, the service is nice, the waiting time is almost 2 minutes for such order in a crowded day.. 

The outdoor seating is clean and it's a fun place to eat after your 8 hours shift.."}
{"text":"You know, Smashburger falls into the middle of my burger list, not the best but not the worst. They do have a couple of really tasty items on the menu. Go for the veggie frites instead of fries, its a nice change. The best thing on their menu is a burger you can only get in Vegas locations.. Yea I am talking about you Sin-City Burger. Keep the defibrillator handy after chowing down on one of those because you might die from your sins. ha ha zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."}
{"text":"I had given this bad a bad review on another site, and decided to give it another try.  I wasn't wrong.  The burgers are so greasy it's disgusting.  They say the meat is seasoned, but it's bland and flavorless.  The fries are really greasy as well.  Twice is more than enough for me... Really once was, but i was trying to be fair and regretted it.

Create (burger place a few blocks east) is so good, i don't see how this place has a chance."}
{"text":"Greasy burger to start! Bad service the maneger Juan was rude and I was very disappointed with there service! Don't pay extra for guacamole they only give u 2 once's per Juan the manger because I didn make a comment regarding the amount I received for paying 1.50 go to chipotle to get ur guacamole"}
{"text":"Worst burger ever. Correction worst ground pepper w a side of burger ever. The meat was covered in ground pepper to the point it was inedible. I dig a greasy burger but the pepper overkilled any joy. The fries were cold and old. Do NOT order a shake (save the money go to Wendy's across the street for a frosty) was more crushed ice then ice cream super gross and had a metallic after taste."}
{"text":"I ordered a buffalo blue chicken sandwich for my wife and a classic burger for myself to go. I get home, and the chicken sandwich did not have any buffalo sauce or blue cheese.  There were only about 4 people in the restaurant when my order was placed, so it wasn't busy. 

I called, and nobody picked up the phone and my only option was to leave a voice mail which of course was not returned. 

Smashburger - I paid for a buffalo blue chicken sandwich and you ripped me off and disappointed my wife... I will be filling out the survey at the bottom of my receipt and hope you'll make it right. Otherwise, you've lost a customer permanently."}
{"text":"Josh must be having a bad day, there's an apropos description of his lack of \"welcome to SmashBurger\" (as always at the Maryland Parkway location)but I'll leave it out. Cheer up mate! On a positive note..\"that's a tasty burger\"!"}
{"text":"I've had smashburger on a number of occasion in Colorado and it's always been awesome. Nice to see what one opened in Charlotte, and it was just as good. 

Gotta go with the classic smashburger, the sauce complements the beef perfectly and the bun is out of this world. 

The favorite part is the smash fries, golden brown and super crispy, and tossed in garlic and what i think is rosemary. addictive. 

The place was a bit of a zoo and the wait time was a little more than i planned for at a fast casual joint, but all in all a really good place."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and frequently visit this Smashburger. It is usually good. It had been a while and we went today. To say it was a disappointment would be an understatement. I got a classic smash and it was messy, not fit for a McDonald's burger. My kid got the kids chicken strips and they were over cooked. The French fries were small, left over cuts and cold. The store was empty too. No reason why the quality should be overlooked. It is too bad that this \"fast dining\" restaurant is lacking, well at least this location. Smashburger, do yourself a favor and check on this franchisee."}
{"text":"They wonder why the parking lot is empty in front of this place.  Their customer service and ability to take an order or answer a question is pretty awful."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!  Each visit is better than the visit before.  Always clean, over friendly staff & oh those fried pickles, yummers.  I'd love to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Good when they aren't busy. Tend to let the quality slip when it's busy, but I'm a regular and would recommend others give them a try."}
{"text":"I am not sure who writes all these good reviews for this place.  All I can say is \"Yuck.\"  $23 dollars for a BBQ Bacon burger, an Avocado burger, an order of fries, and an onion haystack, and 2 small drinks.  

Whoever thought the idea of taking a small piece of what could have started out as a nice piece of meat and smashing all the juice out of it then cooking it until it was almost unrecognizable as beef would be a good idea?  We dined in at about 1:00 PM today, a Tuesday.  There were 2 dirty tables available when we arrived.  When I started cleaning one so we could sit, the girl came up to me and said, \"I will do that for you\" then took the towel out of my hand and walked away to deliver some food to another table.  She came back fairly quickly and did a marginal job cleaning the table by wiping most of the crumbs into her hand and onto the seat.  

My burger was charred on the outside and actually almost as dark brown on the inside as it was on the outside.  If there was bbq sauce on it, there was so little that it was quickly absorbed by the cardboard burger and had very little flavor.  The onion haystack was a small pile of greasy cold onion flavored breading.  The entire $2.29 order of onions was piled in a mound just larger than the total volume of the beef in the burger.  Because the beef was soooooo overcooked, it was not a large piece of meat.  The fries were not much better.  Again, cold and greasy and a very small order, although not as small as the haystack.  My Girlfriend, who likes her beef cooked more well done than I do, also complained that the food was extremely low quality for the price and that we would have been better off ordering from the dollar menu of one of our local burger joints.  Knowing how much we hate those places, that was quite a condemnation on the quality of the food.  I ate about 1/3 of my burger before deciding I couldn't stomach any more of it and she ate just over half of hers.  Then we decided to go across the street to Costco and get a hot dog."}
{"text":"Their burgers are a greasy pile of meh. Their sides are ok. Their prices are on par with other places of a similar calibre.

The parking lot they are in is terrible! I would advise not going there.

*Helpful hint* - Are you already in the disaster of a parking lot where smash burger is? Go past sobey's to five guys, their burgers are way better. You're already in the parking lot, might as well make it worth your while."}
{"text":"This was the first time I was here. The staff was nice and offered to help me make my decisions. Of course I was already looking at a burger... I decided on the Arizona burger because it sounded awesome. It was awesome. I loved the fresh jalapenos and the guac. I ordered a drink which seemed expensive considering they gave me a dine in cup. It would not have been had I not inhaled my burger (I was kind of hungry). Anyway I made myself get a refill and sit there while the burger settled. I added the sweet potato fries to my order and they were a complete disappointment. They were greasy and kind of gross. In fact, if the burger wasn't so good I would not rate this as high. I was super unhappy with my fries..."}
{"text":"smashburger is good. . . .this location despite being only person at register it took several minuted before they could get somebody to the register to take an order.  the guy who was on register was busy walking around  yelling creating goofy drama. . .the other 4 employees were all just standing  around laughing at the antics   while 2 other groups in restaurant  waited for food and shakes. . . .not a place to be able to talk with family without  excessive noise. . . .plenty of other places I would expect this  but not smashburger. . . . sides  were very small portions. . .and haystack onions were swimming in grease. . . one of our burgers was a big one actual size was not any bigger than the regular . . . .likely not back to this location any time soon"}
{"text":"Yesterday at 6:30 PM went to get dinner at this location. It was a comedy act at the store. Five employees could not get any one order right. Customers ahead of me had to wait as their orders were incorrect, Repeated mistakes and do overs. I got my order to go and made a rookie mistake of not checking it (I was tired) and get home and realize that they screwed up the order. I am surprised management is not monitoring this as the revenue per employee must be low compared to other locations. Not going back.

Burgers were not done right either."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Thick juicy burgers with a nice variety of things to add. I am hooked on the grilled chicken burger with bacon and avocado. What really keeps me going back is the sweet potato fries and the veggie frites. I love the idea of fresh veggies instead of deep fried starch with my burger."}
{"text":"Great and reliable. Very consistent and I like all their options.  It's fast and great during the week. 

If they waited on you at the table and had s bar I would rate it higher. 

For fast food it's great!"}
{"text":"This guys are simply awesome!

I am always greeted by the general managers at the cashier and he/she listens to me carefully to take the order as explained. 

Their food is the only one that doesn't make me feel gross like you have eaten a junk food.

I almost feel like a privileged person in their place!

I have tried their beef and crispy chicken burger which both were awesome/juicy/fresh. Their own style for fries is delicious and is prepared by olive oil. Give it a try!

I need to admit that their food is a little pricy...!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best hamburger I've had! I ate the whole thing (I'm a fatty). Onion rings and sauce were awesome. Nothing compares to the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. My hubby had the regular one and nearly finished his he liked it so much. If I ever crave a burger again this is the spot in South Phoenix. One less star because the last of my onion rings was too greasy."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! When we walked in the line was all the way to the back door. It felt understaffed with only 1 cashier and 1 expo. But once we ordered I was blown away by the manager, Amanda Smith (I tried to catch a glimpse of her name tag). She was hustling! Expo, bussing, jumping on the register, spinning shakes, greeting guests, WOW! She even stopped to ensure that a lady who was sitting alone was taken care of and went out of her way to make her an ice water with lemon and deliver it to the table! She is the epitome of GREAT HOSPITALITY!"}
{"text":"Randomly landed here for a late lunch yesterday, I had never heard of it before and I was curious. And once I bit into my BBQ, Bacon & Cheddar burger, I was so glad I stopped in. And the Smashfries were amazing. I was quite impressed. I'll be returning on Monday with a friend to try a FREE Haagen Dazs milkshake :)"}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5, but not close enough to a 4.  My sister and I had gone here the other week and ended up missing some items from our burgers that we paid extra for. No big deal, it was a busy night and it happens, so we called to let them know. The manager, Val, took care of us by offering a re-do on them next time we were in. We went back today and issues arose with the speed of service and attitude of some employees. Look, we both work/have worked food service and get that customers can be obnoxious sometimes... but one of the cashiers was plain rude when we explained our situation, and we saw it was other customers she helped as well. There was also a good amount of standing around talking to another coworker at the window as a line was building. This seems to be a common issue at this location.

Otherwise, the food was good and the orders correct. We'd like to give a shout out of Daisy and Randi, who both gave us excellent service and were very nice (in stark contrast to the other cashier- but I see no reason to tarnish someone's name on Yelp)."}
{"text":"Honestly they should just shut this location down and open something else. came here with my brothers and the cashier was so out of it he made us repeat what we wanted so many times and made no effort to enunciate or display good customer service. Then the food came and I've honestly had better quality food at fast food burger drive thrus. Our fries tasted and looked like they've been sitting in oil all day... so nasty and greasy and no flavor. Also our burgers were so poorly made we couldn't even finish them. Definitely never coming back here again. Disappointing that a place I used to frequent all the time became this way"}
{"text":"This location is as slow as molasses getting your food! I like Smash's  food but they should increase kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Decent burgers a bit on the pricey side.  Great julienne cut fries nice and crispy with wonderful flavour.  Nothing to really grab you and make you want to go back."}
{"text":"went to smash-burger on sat night.  the food was really excellent if not a little messy.  i had the arizona smash and fries.  the fries were a great surprise ...lightly flavored with garlic and rosemary yummm.  and you got plenty to share (which i did).  i kept looking at the menu, it's limited but they seem to have everything i could have wanted and a burger joint.  i would go back till i tried it all.  we shall see.  check this place out."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp. Chose it because of the high ratings. Not really sure why it's rated so high. 

I ordered the jalapeño burger and sweet potato fries. Both were ok but nothing special. It's basically a small step above a typical fast food chain - there's just more topping options and apparently the meat is all fresh, not frozen. But I couldn't tell any difference. I wouldn't go back. If I want an expensive burger I'd go to a specialty restaurant, not here."}
{"text":"BEST fast food burger....period."}
{"text":"After having Smashburger in the NE and loving it before we moved the SE we thought we would try the new location and we were horribly disappointed.
We ordered smash fries, my husband had regular and I tried sweet potato fries and neither one of them had any seasonings.
We got deep fried pickles and they were terrible!  They were so salty and terrible.
The burgers were ok but barely.
I sent feedback via the link on their website and never heard back from anyone.
I would not recommend this location based on our experience here."}
{"text":"I had the avacado chicken sandwich. My husband had the classic burger. We had fries and the flash fried veggies. Probably one of THE  best chicken sandwiches I have ever had. So juicy and super fresh. The flash fried veggies were amazing. Everything was so fresh and full of flavor. My husband loved that they serve beer as well. Kilt lifter and a great burger and he was a happy man.  It was really busy when we went, stood in line for about 10 minutes but totally worth it. The service was great. The staff was really energetic and positive. Always a plus."}
{"text":"I just popped my smashburger cherry!

There's been so much hype that I had to try it.  I ordered the mushroom burger.  They technically have 3 sizes - kids, regular and big smash.  The mushroom burger has garlic, mushrooms, swish cheese on an egg bun.  I held the mayo.  The burger was real juicy and cooked medium.  I wish the egg bun was toasted as it was softer than I'm used to but since it was obviously fresh it didn't hurt.

Note - you can make your own burger and there's a menu with a slew of free sauces and toppings.  That'll be my next burger.

What put me over the top was their smashfries.  Wow.  Rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  I wish it was served a bit more crispy as I prefer my fries more well done but the flavor was incredible.  I'll just ask for it well done next time.   My next fries order will be the truffle fries.  I'm drooling already.

The service was quick.   You order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Very low key but it's reflected in their decent prices."}
{"text":"We tried Smashburger this weekend on our way to the NASCAR race in Avondale. I had heard about it before, but we don't have a location nearby. I was eager to try it out when we found one. 

We both ordered the Classic SmashBurger (the bigger size -  1/2 lb patty, $5.99) which came with American cheese (I'd go with cheddar next time - I didn't notice it came with American when I ordered it), lettuce, tomato, ketchup, onion (we got grilled instead of raw), pickles and smash sauce. We also each got a side of SmashFries which were thin-cut fries, covered in garlic, olive oil and rosemary. The burgers were greasy (I like that) and very good! They tasted beefy and fresh, exactly how a good burger should be. The fries were a nice change from normal fries and tasted great. If we were in the area, or close to another location, we'd definitely stop by again. I'd like to try to Arizona SmashBurger next time - it sounded amazing! 

The service was fast, attentive and friendly. 

The only star-docking drawback was the price. I think that the burger price should include fries."}
{"text":"This Place is the BOMB!!!! Love it! Love IT!! LOVE IT! Fed a family of 5 for 30 bucks! And we were stuffed! THe burgers are fresh hand made and thick. The kids meals were only 3.99 and the burgers were large. All the food I saw coming from the kitchen looked sooo yummy. I want to try that wedge salad next time and a dog with the works ( saw one coming out and it looked yummy). Everything was gourmet and delicious. Great quality food! I had an Arizona smash burger ( I highly recommend this burger if you like spicy food although it wasn't too spicy, they put fresh jalapenos in it and you could just pick out some of them if its too spicy for you. This is my new fav. place to eat. The kids really liked it too."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location, and I can officially now review this location at 2 stars.  

Fries were so gross. Clearly the fry oil needed to be changed.
Veggie burger was ok.
Service was ok- just going through the motions. 
The place was filthy. They were not busy, plenty of staff and everything was dirty.
The tables outside had ketchup and mustard bottles sitting in the 100 degree sun- yuck."}
{"text":"Arguably the best burger in Charlotte and the surrounding area. OMG! you have got to go and try this thing. It is so tender and melt in your mouth. Though you can order many different combinations, I order my Big Smash Burger with just American cheese, Tomato, Mayo, and a fried egg on the Egg Bun. The burger is so large that it hangs over the bun. It is sooooooooooo good."}
{"text":"Awesome. Food was fresh and tasty. Servers were friendly.  The atmosphere was nice.  I'm a burger enthusiast and i was very happy with my sin city burger. 

I tried the sin city burger, sweet potato fries, salad, and bbq bacon burger.  The fact that the burger itself was fresh and just the right amount, made all the difference.  Add on the other things, it was delish.  

Only wish there were more burgers to try they had about 7 maybe. And they have a smash sauce which i couldn't really taste but maybe because i was just devouring it too fast lol

Affordable!"}
{"text":"Yum, a little on the greasy side, but pretty tasty!  The burgers come in a few different sizes and they have good hot dogs too.  I haven't tried one, but they also have gigantic salads...probably more unhealthy than a burger.  The meat is good quality and toppings are nice.  The rosemary parm fries and straw onions are rockin sides.  

They have malts and shakes...really?  Like you would need that, whatever.  I enjoyed Smashburger, grease and all, but sort of felt like I wanted to wash my face after eating my lunch.  I'll be back, but Smashburgers are a sometimes food!"}
{"text":"Not enough staff to clean the tables. Many tables and window tables had trash for over thirty minutes.  Food was ok but could not appreciate meal when we had to bus our own tables.  Other customers were bussing tables, too.  Order took 25 minutes to arrive.  This may be an isolated instance, however."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before a movie.  Awesome homemade style burgers and great fries.  Simple a bigger better burger. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place many times, but this is my first time reviewing on Yelp. 

While I have enjoyed my chicken sandwich, the fries were cold. My first job was at a fast food restaurant, so I know how long it takes for fries to get cold and inedible. That knowledge just makes it all the more insulting, knowing that my food was cooked BEFORE I set foot in the establishment. Lazy. Very lazy.

If you're going to serve me an awesome sandwich, why pair it with a side that was borderline comatose? Unhappy. 

Next time I want a good experience I'll just go to The Stand."}
{"text":"I am back in the \"smashburger\" fan club!!  I was a mark for their food the first time I ate there with my kiddos based on a recommendation to try it.  Since I am a self proclaimed burger aficianado (thousands of burgers enjoyed & counting....), I jumped at the chance.  I was in beef heaven initially because, although the burgers were a tad pricey in comparison to the other big fast food joints, the kids meals were very affordable & pretty good sized to boot & the taste of the fresh food combined with the energetic ambience had me \"hook, line & belly\"!   After my 3rd or 4th visit, the kids meals shrank in size (both the burger & amount of fries).  It was disappointing because, I went there with my kids as a treat to them.  Alas, it sems they have corrected the mistake & returned to the same portions for the childrens meals!!  Thank you Smashburger, I love ya!!"}
{"text":"On our Friday lunch tradition, coworkers convinced me to come to this place. I wasn't too crazy about it being a chain and all but gave it a shot anyway. 

Upon entrance, it looks like Chipotle added more red and now serves burgers. After one look at the menu and remembering the Rito's 3pm lull the week before, I decided on the wedge salad but my coworkers all got burgers. 

The place was crowded but we easily found seating on the patio. The wait was kinda long but then a few workers were walking around apologizing to people about the wait explaining that the food inspector was in, so they were being extra careful. Hmmm..shouldn't they just be conducting business as usual, like in a regular and safe manner as \"always\"? Regardless, I actually appreciated that they thought to be a little proactive. 

The wedge was huge, the iceberg and bleu cheese fresh and the bacon crispy. After watching the grease spots quickly accumulate on their basket liners, I was so grateful for not ordering the burger. 

We ordered veggie frites for the table and these were just gross- 10-12 pieces of oily \"flash fried\" asparagus and carrots with a side of ranch for $3. No thanks. 

The only complaint I heard from my fellow diners was that they didn't ask what temp you wanted it cooked, but it seems like maybe hers was just overlooked. 

Next time I'm in the mood for a burger, I doubt I'd return here, I'd much rather spend the same amount of money (probably less) for the cheeseburger @ Phoenix City Grille."}
{"text":"I'm not too much of a fast food burger joint girl.  Mainly because I try not to eat fattening stuff.  I stress the \"try not to\".  So occasionally we will indulge in some Smash.  I think the first time I had a burger here I didn't like it.  I don't remember why though.  With an attempt to keep it lower in fat (I know how is that possible right?) I usually order the grilled chicken sandwich so I feel better about myself.   

This place is modern, vibrant and clean.  There is an emphasis on the red with huge red lettering on the walls.  I think it pretty nicely decorated. You walk in and find yourself immediately in line to order.  The menu is located on the wall right before you get to the cashier to place your order.  They have burgers, chicken sandwiches, hotdogs, salads and shakes.  You place your order and then are given a number to set at your table so your food can be brought to you.  The sodas are self serve.

The BF and I both ordered the Buffalo Smashed Chicken.  Its a thinly sliced grilled chicken topped with buffalo sauce, lettuce, tomato and blue cheese crumbles.  The do make a breaded version as well.  I usually take off a lot of the blue cheese because it seems to overpower everything.  Its definitely one of those things where a little goes a long way.  The BF has his on the side all together.  The buns are a little shiny like they are basted with oil or butter.  I could do without the basting.  Overall the sandwich is good I just think it could use a little more buffalo sauce and less blue cheese.  I might try something different next time because I wasn't too impressed this last time.  I dipped mine in ranch hoping to tone it down a bit-but ranch was NOT on the diet plan.

My daughter ordered the kids hotdog with fries.  They split the dog in half and grill it middle side down (if that makes sense).  She says she thinks they do that so there is a little place to put the ketchup-right down the middle.  The fries are nothing to brag about.  They are skinny and really crispy.  I like my fries a little soft in the middle.

I do love condiments and they have a small variety.  I think they need to get creative and add some love into their condiments.  Just saying.  The service was good and everyone was nice.  The place is a little on the pricy side for a burger hot spot.  Our bill was about $30 for lunch WITH a kids meal.  We will be back and probably get the same thing forgetting we weren't too keen on the blue cheese. LOL  Its just a regular burger joint in my opinion. Since they are in my area I'm sure to return.

On a side note - 10% off your order when you check in on Yelp.  Too bad I checked in after I ordered. :(   Oh and they have outdoor seating for when the weather isn't 117 degrees. ;)"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. Tasty burgers, great topping options, way above average sides.

Both times I've been here I've had a perfectly cooked (medium, still just a little pink!) burger. They specifically say they don't cook to order (or cook rare to medium) but I've found the patties to be juicy, wonderfully loose (not overworked) and tasty.

I've been split between trying to cram as much deliciousness onto the burger and just having a simple sandwich and letting the meat shine. Both have been great and I'd suggest doubling your visit frequency to enjoy burgers at both ends of the spectrum. (though always get the egg bun!)

Sides have been great across the board, with the only disappointment being the overly greasy smashfries (love the fact that they're shoestring though). Haystack onions are a treat and the mushroom poutine was also great.

I'm not a fan of unsweetened ice-tea, but it's core to the chain's American roots. The beers are decent price at $3.99 (if you don't feel like too much of a dirtbag ordering a beer at a quick-serve place) and the McKay's milkshakes are rock solid delicious.

I'm actually glad that there isn't one near me in the south, or I'd be eating here waaaaaaay to often."}
{"text":"I've lived here almost a year now, regretting it taking so long to try this place! If you're in the mood for a seriously tasty burger, try smash burger. The meat is delicious & juicy, buns are soft, toppings are fresh, sauce is GOOD & don't hesitate... Get the sweet potato fries w/ BBQ to dip them. Seriously good food."}
{"text":"while visiting caesar palace casino,  happy we came across SmashBurger in their food court. First time ever patronizing this establishment.  Pleasantly surprised at the good burgers service w/thin crispy fries. Too bad they don't have location in my home state."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of burgers. Especially the fast food types. You heard me! Not even a Big Mac!... EVER!!! Thanks to Daddy's awesome handmade burgers from my childhood, it means that I have no mercy when it comes to burgers anywhere else. 

That being said: Love this place! Great burgers, awesome (bad-for-you) poutine, fountain drinks and even licensed drinks (Beer mainly). They have a variety of burgers, chicken and veggie burgers that go from fully-loaded to California inspired. 

Check it out! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Have you ever taken a bite from something and just knew it was fresh? That's what I get when I bite into a smashburger, instant freshness.

I was waiting to try this place out, and on the way home from work last week, I finally had the opportunity to step in. It took me awhile to decide what to order as everything sounds amazing. I finally settled on the spicy baja burger as I'm a sucker for spicy food. All the toppings on the spicy baja burger were delicious. Guacamole, a good spicy mayo, fresh jalapenos! None of that from a jar stuff, you can tell they cut them there. Superb!

The sweet potato smashfries were amazing as well. Good balance of rosemary and garlic with some olive oil. I'm drooling as I type this! The place is nice and clean inside, great to chill and enjoy the delicious food made for you.

It is probably the best burger in Calgary. If you know of better, please message me as I'd like to try it!"}
{"text":"Smashburger was an amazing experience, I've been to many before but this location was just stunning i went during the grand opening week and was immediately happily greeted by Shenee! She was very helpful and a warmhearted waitress. During my meal Kevin kept me in mind and always asked if i needed a refill or to take away any left over trash on the table and was very kind making the experience better! I will be coming back to this location soon!"}
{"text":"We had heard so much about smashbuger and their grand opening at Desert Ridge so we decided to give it a shot. There was a normal sized line that took longer then expected. When we finally got to the cashier we order two chicken sandwiches with a few condiments... it took over 30 minutes to get our food AFTER we ordered. To top it off the chicken on the sandwiches were thinner than even the tomatoes! I mean I know they're called SMASHburger, but seriously. After the long wait, skimpy chicken and stingy condiments we will not go back."}
{"text":"Was really excited that they built a new Smashburger not only right next to my apartment, but right across the street from In and Out Burger meaning I could pick and choose between the two! However, I've been to this new Smashburger place a total of 3 times since it opened and have gotten sick 2 out of the 3 times I went there...and the first time I didn't get sick, but happened to find a black hair in my burger....like actually inside the burger....not on top or falling off the side....actually INSIDE the burger. The worse thing is I never get sick in general, so the fact that their burgers made me sick says a bunch....I don't think their employees take the proper precautions or obey food laws for all I know.....fuck this place. Never again."}
{"text":"Don't come here during lunch. One person working the register, long line. Poor guy was trying the take orders and deliver orders to people waiting to eat. Burgers were backed up under the heat lamps. A girl finally showed up and delivered the burgers and then disappeared and the guy was trying to do both jobs again. My burger sat under the heat lamp for over 5 minutes."}
{"text":"There isn't a shortage of quality burger joints in Charlotte. Smashburger is a new addition in town. The burgers are decent, tasty, but, in all honesty, pretty blah. There's very little about Smashburger's food, or their restaurant, that separates them from other burger joints in town. Don't get me wrong, I love a greasy burger, but when you can squeeze enough grease to lube your car's engine, it's back to the drawing board for you.

Oh, and a word to future business entrepreneurs: if you're the owner or operator of a business or franchise that's getting ready to open to the public here very soon, and you see someone - namely, me - checking out your menu and taking a peek inside, take a few seconds to introduce yourselves and give a future customer the lowdown. This happened to me a few days before Smashburger opened; there were about 3 or 4 men who were clearly all part of this franchise milling around the front door, none of whom approached me or asked me if I had any questions. I'm not saying I needed to be flattered, but here's a golden opportunity to earn yourself some repeat business, and you let that opportunity pass. Didn't they learn you that in biz skool?"}
{"text":"I ate here the other day, first time I've eaten at smashburger ever, and was quite surprised. I had the mushroom swiss burger and I thought it was terrific, the fries were just right, service was fast and friendly I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger (forget the chicken - sub the burger)!!! Great stuff - LOVE the sweet potato fries. 

Great service - great atmosphere (open)."}
{"text":"Great place to have a fulfilling meal ! Nothing beats some tasty greasy food when you have a hang over"}
{"text":"Our fourth satisfactory trip to Smashburger seals the deal as far as my review is concerned.  Though there isn't much variety on the menu, they offer a lot of great choices to customize what you're getting - you can even choose what type of bun you get.  The burgers are great, black bean burger is excellent, fries and onion rings are awesome and they have really good shakes.  The one and only complaint I have so far is they are a little stingy with the blue cheese when it has been my cheese of choice.

A solid spot for burgers."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! Excellent burger! Had the most amazing bun! Great flavor, fresh to order... I had never been to a smash burger before but I definately will return!! I highly recommend! I plan on taking my kids to try it on their next visit... can't say enough about it"}
{"text":"Finally got over to Smashburger to see what the fuss was about. Too bad after eating, I still wasn't quite sure. Color me unimpressed.

Ordered the 1/3lb  Spicy Baja, the bun was dry, the meat  was overdone and flavorless, and the predominant taste was the chipotle mayo. Not too good, in my opinion. 

My husband made the better choice with the Avocado Club burger. His multi-grain bun was pretty good, his 1/2lb burger was juicier, too.

We also ordered the sweet potato fries which were inedible. They weren't crisp in the least bit. Just soaked in oil. A huge disappointment. I'm usually a big fan of sweet potato fries. The haystack onions weren't much better they were super greasy, too.

Give me a double double & fries anyday."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great customer service and good eats. Do yourself a favor and just try it one time."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy smashburger but recently they made their portions smaller. I ordered a large burger and it looked like the regular size burger and the fries used to take up half the \"plate\" but no they put fries on a smaller plate on top of the \"plate\" they give you. For the price I would expect more. I'll go to In and Out from now on and if I have a coupon I'll come back."}
{"text":"Great burgers, best sauce, great onion rings.

Fun place, check it out."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! Customer service and the food. I specifically asked for fresh fries and I got my food and my fries were cold. So I told the shift manager and she said she would replace them for me but it took 15 min. FYI the bathroom was very dirty."}
{"text":"OMG!!! When I am in need of an excellent turkey burger, this place is where you'll find me. And may I mention the great, friendly, fast service."}
{"text":"I've been dining at this Smashburger for over two years now. I feel as though the food is no longer as good as it used to be. It is hit or miss with the staff as far as friendliness, and that goes for management as well. The burgers are very small, and need seasoning! The chicken is very bland, with no seasoning as well. The breaded chicken always has a burnt taste and is never juicy. I am about ready to boycott this restaurant. They have very overpriced food for what you get. I also don't like the fact that every time I go in there to eat most of the tables are dirty. They always ask how your food is when you have a mouth full of food too. Someone should teach the servers the 101 basics of serving. I believe they should lower their prices for what you get. The whole like concept of smashed just makes me think of them being cheap. The thin burgers and the super smashed chicken are not what we want to pay for. I think it's time Smashburger did a revamp of their menu!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are ok.  A bit pricier than fast foods but I really didn't think the quality was worth the price.  I would eat here again, maybe."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here. Burgers are juicy and smash fries are great. Shakes are good here also. Service is fast and food fresh. Kinda too cold with ac blasting but it's near the end of summer. They open early and location is near my home. Clean and spacious."}
{"text":"This place needs some help! The guy @ the counter couldn't get a very simple order down, we repeated our order so many times!!! Then the place was not clean: tables, floor & soda fountain were filthy... The tables in need of repair. Just not a good location, I've been to a different location before which was MUCH better & CLEAN!!!"}
{"text":"Well... They have driven us away and we will never return.

They no longer offer spinach and goat cheese! The two reasons we have spent the money with this chain for the last 6mo.

Goodbye smash burger. I am very disappointed that you choose to take off the two healthiest items on the menu.

Whoever decided this at corporate should be fired.

-----UPDATE-----

I see my review was deleted... So here it is for everyone to see again!"}
{"text":"Come here for lunch a lot, really enjoy the food. The burgers are always so good, the fries are always hit or miss. One of my the very few places I will eat a burger."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff and burgers are always good! They have a nice patio too! Another great feature is you can order online for take out. Love their smash fries!"}
{"text":"My #1 favorite burger joint! The rosemary and olive oil SMASHFRIES are INCREDIBLE! I love the # of add ons! Service has always been great and they offer a reward program to earn free food!!!"}
{"text":"On multiple occasions this location can never seem to get online orders correct. This time burgers were missing and ingredients were added to burgers that were explicitly asked to be left off. Tried calling the location to let them know of the errors and got no one on the phone. No voicemail offered just a request to call back later. Called back later and still no one answered. Guess the only way to contact someone is to call the Corporate office on Monday. Maybe they'll care enough to invoke improvements in carry out / online orders."}
{"text":"Clean. Friendly staff. Fresh ingredients. Juicy burger."}
{"text":"Don't expect your food to be ready at the time you pick in your online order. They are ALWAYS late and less than friendly about it. There are establishments with much better levels of service."}
{"text":"After a quick shopping session at the near by Walmart, a girlfriend and I decided to head to Smashburger for dinner. I had remembered I joined the Smashclub a few months back  (after filling out a survey on a previous receipt for a free side) and had an email coupon for a BOGO for their chicken sandwich.

We both opted for the Avocado club crispy chicken burger (Fresh avocado, applewood-smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, ranch dressing and mayo on a multi-grain bun), haystack onion rings (for our free side Yayyyy!) and an oreo milkshake.

Our food came out pretty quick and we weren't disappointed trying out the chicken burgers. Everyone who knows me (or has read my other reviews) know how much I love bacon :)
The onion rings were crisp but they were quite salty - we didn't end up finishing them.

I would definitely recommend signing up for the Smashclub, you get sent emails from time to time with really good coupons  - who doesn't like enjoying good food and saving a bit of money?"}
{"text":"Last 2 times I got a burger here the outside of the hamburger was burnt to where it was crispy, IMO not healthy. Won't be back for another try."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff. Love being welcomed every time I go in. Foods pretty good too."}
{"text":"A semi fastfood burger joint where you can buy a bucket of beer (4 bottles) with your meal. It was our first time eating here, the staff was friendly and helpful. You can choose from 3 sizes of burgers, grilled chicken, choice of bun, sauces, and toppings/add-ons. Also available are fresh salads, shakes, regular and sweet potato fries, veggie frites, and fried pickles."}
{"text":"The flavour of the burger was good but left me UN satisfied and the side of fries was fresh but small and once again UN-satisfying.

The food was tasty, but expensive compared to many of the other US chains that have ventured North.

The restaurant itself was littered with garbage on the carpet, with a bunch of dirty tables ."}
{"text":"Haystack onion rings.  Must go for this alone.  Great burgers, first time I almost couldn't eat a burger right away because it was so hot off the grill!  Tasted fresh, I forgot burgers could (and should!) taste like that.   Nice selection on the menu, too bad I can't stop ordering the burger long enough to try other things!

 Line can get long fast because cashiers stop taking orders to make a milkshake if someone orders one.  One other minor detail, but they should invest in traditional napkin holders on the tables!  Are several napkins rolled in half tucked in a metal basket.  Hard to get one without smearing them all!"}
{"text":"I really like SmashBurger, so I figured that I would write a review. They are usually very consistent with all their burgers, and I really like the Sin City burger. The Avocado Club this time was a total miss though. Seems like the avocado wasn't ripe just yet, and was super hard in comparison to the usual creamy ones I get from them. The Triple Double is only missing the burger patties being crusted in Cheetos before being fried, but otherwise it deserves being called a Triple Double. Depending on the cook, you will either get a nice sear on the burger or a bit of a crunchy crust (which I got this time and I love). Ketchup and Mustard on the table, and a plethora of sauce options, all within walking distance make this one of my favorite places to go get Smashed."}
{"text":"The smash burger & chicken avocado club along with smash fries were very delicious. 1st time customer. The place was very clean, a bit cold but what do u expect in AZ."}
{"text":"We ordered burgers from this location yesterday, and they were delicious. The place looked clean and well attended; we didn't stay as it was super crowded, so we ordered to go."}
{"text":"Yes, the burgers are huge, but nothing really awe inspiring.  I got the Sin city burger.  The egg in it added a nice extra taste, and the meat was cooked so the juices still flowed in it.  I have to say though, the burger was really really salty.  Yes, there was bacon, but it tasted like the bacon had an extra layer of salt on it.  The sweet potato fries were really greasy, but at least they were tasty.  

Overall, I think this place is way overpriced for a measly gourmet burger.  An In N Out double double provides a better satisfaction rating, and at half the cost."}
{"text":"If you want fast food burgers that are fresh and delicious this is the place to go. More seating than at ASU. 

Delicious and the smash fries can't be beat!  However, err on the side of caution! Way greasy food, I mean- the grease drips off of the burgers and onto the paper. The shakes are fattening but that's the best kind, because they are delicious and made with real ice cream! I can not possibly recommend the milk shakes enough! They even have malts."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. It's near campus, and I live close by so I do come here often. Manager is a great guy, greets everyone with a kind, professional word. Great for groups as well. Food is out of this world delicious! Smash fries are divine. However, err on the side of caution! Way greasy food, I mean- the grease drips off of the burgers and onto the paper. The shakes are fattening but that's the best kind, because they are delicious and made with real ice cream! I can not possibly recommend the milk shakes enough! They even have malts.

Some times this one is so crowded you wont get a seat, so please be prepared to face a completely loud and crowded restaurant. Also, depending on what you get, bit pricey, but you get what you pay for- high quality."}
{"text":"Just saw this place while we were out n about in Monroville & decided to try since we'd never heard about it... Had a good experience! Good first impression. Burger, fries & chicken strips were good. Nice clean place, pleasant service. Not too expensive / pretty standard prices for two people to eat out. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"So far, best grilled chicken sandwich I have ever had, as well as the best fries ever! The smash fries are amazing. Tossed in a perfect mixture of olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. SO scrumptious! I really like how you can choose which kind of bun you would like. The wheat one is really good to me, it might be called multigrain, but I cannot remember, only that it was tasty. 

I have been told the burgers are great, so that will be my next meal hopefully, though those grilled chicken they offer is quite amazing and I love my chicken! And I might try a milkshake one day, but only if I can share it with someone like they did the 50s. That would be super awesome.

I do feel the price is a little steep and it took a super long time to get my food to go, I will still be back. Most definitely for those AMAZING fries!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Smashburger a few times since they have been open. Almost every time I've gone in I have been waited on by this lovely young lady Latrice. She has given me outstanding service every time. When you walk in the first thing you see is her smiling face. Latrice has made each and every one of my visits amazing. Thank you for the great service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Awesome visit! It was super packed in there but the two cashiers got through the massive line quickly. When it was our turn, the cashier Savannah was super nice and helpful! Our food was fantastic and the employees that were bussing the tables were also really cheerful. I will absolutely go back and tell all my friends in the process. Go eat here!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a chain.. we will probably be back for more in the future but I think I would prefer if Dickies BBQ (which was there before)was still there :/"}
{"text":"C and I were running errands all day in Scottsdale and needed a quick bite before a Christmas party. With all my weird dietary habits, I try not to depend on big get together for me to get a full meal and I needed a base layer for drinking. 
While shopping for white elephant gifts at Barnes and Noble, I looked up Smashburger. They have sweet potato fries and a black bean burger, count me in!
It is a typical order at register, snag table marker, sit down and wait place. Ultra casual.
I ordered the black bean veggie burger (sans dairy) and C got a classic smash burger plus an order of sweet potato fries to split.
The burgers are massive! My black bean burger had a lot of flavor and was well made! The sweet potato fries are extra long and crisp. Exactly what we were looking for! 
This place is a win!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!, wasn't too impressed with the sweet potato fries, but the burger itself was great.   Would classify this place better than Culvers, but not quite as good as Five Guys, since the prices are roughly the same"}
{"text":"So we came here because it's one my wife's grandmother's favorite places for a burger. We all sat down and started eating. One of my boys is autistic  and started to melt down over a shake his younger brother got. \"T\", one of the staff members recognized what was happening and came over offered my son a shake. This totally diffused the situation. Thanks \"T\" and Smash Burger,your a class act!!!"}
{"text":"Beware if U use a credit care at this place. I made a purchase there & put it on a charge care. While checking my purchases for the day I noticed that they had charged me for my purchase as well as a thither for a larger amount. When I went back the next day & confronted them they said they would take care of the Mistake & issue me a credit.5 days later I talked to the Area manger & all he said he couldn't to anything . He told me to call my bank and report a fraud transaction. Nice way to take care of his Company's mistake. It makes a person think twice before doing business with them. I know I will & I hope all of you do the same."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service from the GM and just a great reasonably priced experience!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger is the Classics burger the smash sauce is sooo good! The smash fries are sooo good and fresh always! I also recommend the Classic chicken it's moist and juicy!"}
{"text":"Someone needs to take the salt away from the cook, pronto! I had the mushroom swiss burger which was the saltiest thing I have ever had. Blech. My son had the bacon cheeseburger which was every bit as salty and terrible as mine. My daughter had the hotdog and couldn't eat half of it because it was too salty and just plain terrible. The fried pickle chips tasted like they were coated in nothing but salt. The fries were pathetic. The highlight was my wife's chicken avocado sandwich which was nothing to write home about. $37 later we walked out with the collective agreement that we would NEVER eat there again. 

I've had better burgers next door at Johnny Rockets and Johnny Rockets is dogshit!"}
{"text":"Will have to try it again, fried pickles a little salty.  Burgers are never as good when take out, will have to eat in next time"}
{"text":"Of all the burger places I've tried so far, I have to say that this one is my favorite. It must be the saltiness and juiciness of the burgers AND the delightful crispy chicken sandwiches. Service is always friendly and they always check on you to make sure everything is alright. The shakes are very nice, too. I just wish they would bring back the wine!"}
{"text":"WHAT?! dude. All you have to know is, my Smashburger experience was AAA! and that's triple A for not just their Amazing beef burgers, but for their Amazing service and Amazing selection of sides, Milkshakes (YUMMM!!!) and did you know they serve BEER? I'm not a big beer drinker, but when I do drink beer, these guys have the beers I prefer; ahem, Big Rock's Traditional, Kokanee and a couple more I clearly recognized when I was there but forgot while writing this review haha

And just FYI, I've eaten every burger they have haha! And its not just beef. Believe it or not, their vegetarian burger, Spicy Baja, won my taste buds tonight! vegetarian patty, cheese, avacado, spicy sauce and jalepeno's OMG... BTW, I eat Alberta beef just as much as the next beef lover; medium rare! but seriously, this burger is really really good.

I thought the only place in town that had jalepenos in their burgers was Clive Burger, but they don't even come close to this place.

Smashburger has 2 locations in Calgary at the moment; one here on 32ave and another one in Royal Oak. They have plans to open a few more in the future. WOOT! 

Everyone I know that has eaten here before just loves this place; it's not hard to understand why :)

Smashburger is awesome, delicious and fun!!!"}
{"text":"I asked for extra cheese and they didn't give it until I asked, also they gave my milkshake to the wrong table, and only gave me one when I confronted them about it."}
{"text":"Wish there was a negative star I could rate this pathetic sorry excuse of a burger joint who i still 6 months later, should have given me my money back. I wish I could at least say the service was good, even fair. But sadly no. First they mess up my order by forgetting some toppings I paid extra for. Then I had to ask them for my fries. And that's after a 15 minute wait. And all without so much as an apology. I beg you to not WASTE your money or time in this highly disappointing burger spot"}
{"text":"Arrived in Vegas yesterday and this is already my second Smashburger. Highly recommended. 

Had the mushroom Swiss burger with smash fries first time. Liked it enough to come back. 

Second time I had the bbq bacon & cheddar. Bacon was nice and crispy. Bbq sauce wasn't too spicy and tasted great. They even used real cheddar. 

Smash fries are shoestring potatoes tossed in olive oil? and garlic & herbs. I prefer a thicker fry, but the flavours were great. 

Staff was friendly and more attentive than expected for a fast food place."}
{"text":"We end up here actually quite a bit, as it is handy in our neighborhood when we don't feel like driving out to Arrowhead...But honestly, I never really know what to expect!  
OK, so their unique & flavorful Buffalo & Blue Cheese Smashchicken Sandwich is usually a winner...The problem lies with the unpredictable customer service & staff.  One week you may get a team that really seems to care, then a few weeks later, a whole new crew, & tables will be greasy, littered, & they will be out of iced tea & diet Coke.
This past Friday night was a good night at Smashburger though, with clean tables, & a staff that actually seemed to care...Fingers crossed, honestly the employees can make or break this place.  The burgers & sandwiches are somewhat unique & tasty, & they have fun sides like \"Smashfries\" (fries with olive oil & rosemary),& a nice customer rewards program, which I am always a sucker for!"}
{"text":"BOMB! Burger was amazing! Cooked just right, fries were yummy. I bought the beer combo! Had a tad to much to drink as I write this. But I thought the burger was amazing! I would eat here even if I were sober!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, always out of everything and dirty restaurant. I've called corporate they don't care. They have an underage employee serving alcohol. All in all it's taken 3 visits in the last year and I will never go back to this Smashburger or any for the lack of acknowledgment from corporate."}
{"text":"We made our first visit to this place and I must say, we were all very pleased with our burgers.  You can build your own, which we liked and did, the burgers we had were 1/3 pound, juicy, and fresh.  The fries were fries, though they do have Smash Fries which are seasoned with Rosemary & Olive Oil, different and if you like Rosemary, very tasty.  We would recommend this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"The cashier didn't have great customer service. The fries didn't look like what was on the menu (they came out super skinny no salt or any seasoning). And the burger I got was okay, the chicken was too thin for me I prefer more meat. The soda was good lol"}
{"text":"I went here just before they closed and let me tell you it was the freshest new I have ever had. I was expecting that it was gunna be just okay since they were closing but it was so good! The best part about it was it was my firsts time trying their turkey burger, which I had got on the chipotle bun, and man, it was something else. The employees were friendly and it was very clean."}
{"text":"Had an awesome burger (gluten free). 
They did it perfect for me (celiac)
Fries in separate fryer"}
{"text":"Not vegetarian friendly. I ordered a black bean burger and side salad...the food came out quickly and tasted good until I came to a piece of bacon in my burger and a piece of beef in my salad...wtf? It was so off putting, I won't be visiting Smashburger again a anytime soon. Their fries also aren't vegetarian...They're cooked in beef fat, why is this necessary? Fries can taste just as good cooked in oil. Please catch up with the times Smashburger and make your food healthy."}
{"text":"Smashburger has now arrived in Charlotte, NC. Located in the Stonecrest shopping center, Smashburger is the latest addition to Charlotte's ever growing restaurant scene. I was invited to the Smashburger pre-grand opening event to sample some of the delicious food now being offered in south Charlotte.

When my girlfriend and I arrived for the pre-grand opening event we were greeted at the front door by a staff of friendly people just waiting to show off the great food they had to offer. We were told to try anything on the menu and order as much as we would like too because everything would be free and they wanted us to try as much as wewanted  I don't think there is anything I love more than FREE FOOD!!!! We decided to try the BBQ Ranch Chicken Sandwich, the Carolina Burger, the Smashfries, the Sweet Potato Fries, the Fried Pickles, the Brunswick Fries, two IBC bottled root beers and five different shake samples. I know, I know... that's alot of food... but it was free!!!! So I couldn't resist  

The BBQ Chicken Sandwich was amazing! Complete with Crispy or Grilled Chicken, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Haystack Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, BBQ Sauce and Ranch Dressing on an egg bun... the BBQ Chicken Sandwich at Smashburger was one of my favorite Chicken Sandwich's anywhere and the easiest recommendation I can give for Smashburger.

The Brunswick Fries had mixed opinions throughout their Charlotte debut. Some people didn't like them.. some said they were ok... but I liked them. They reminded my alot of an upgraded version of Backyard Burgers Chili Cheese Fries. The menu described the Brunswick Fries as being Smashfries with Brunswick stew and shredded cheese over top. I didn't taste any Brunswick stew on the fries... but what I did taste was pulled pork with a little bit of corn mixed in over top of crispy fries and topped with shredded cheese. I thought the Brunswick Fries were delicious and despite the mixed feeling at their debut, I would recommend them.

The Carolina Burger is something unique to this location and not offered anywhere else. Made with Pimina Cheese, BBQ Sauce and Vidalia Onion BBQ Slaw on an Egg Bun, the Smashburger Carolina Burger was unlike any other Carolina Burger I have ever had. The Pimina Cheese oozed out of the sides and the Vidalia Onion BBQ Slaw covered a delicious 100% Angus Beef Patty. The Smashburger Carolina Burger was delicious and an easy recommendation.

The Fried Pickles were thick cut dill pickles, battered and deep fried served with buttermilk ranch dressing. They tasted alot like the fried pickles you get at Macs Speed Shop, which are of course amazing. I prefer really thin cut fried pickles... so they weren't my favorite... but that's just a personal preference. If you like thick cut fried pickles, Smashburger makes exactly what you are looking for!

The Sweet Potato Smashfries and the original Smashfries were well above your average french fries. Tossed in rosemary, olive oil and garlic, the Smashfries make for the perfect companion to any burger and sandwich at Smashburger. Drench them in either the buttermilk ranch or cover them in ketchup and mustard, either way you cant go wrong with Smashfries!

While eating the mega banquet laid out in front of us, the staff also walked around with samples of the many flavors of Haagan-Dazs milkshakes that Smashburger also offers.  We tried the Nutterbutter, the Reeses, the Strawberry, the Vanilla and the Banana Pudding Milkshakes. Every one of them were amazing and should accompany anything you order when going to Smashburger. My favorite however, was the nutterbutter milkshake!!!

There are plenty of other burger options around Charlotte, but none has to offer what Smashburger does. I welcome Smashburger to south Charlotte and look forward to seeing them grow in our city. If you are in the area and are looking to try something new, stop by the Stonecrest shopping center and try out the newest burger joint in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Pretty solid burger spot.  This place is fast and serves up a good, solid burger. I have also tried the fried pickles which have been a bit too salty at times.  Definately better than fast food or The habit at a resonable price."}
{"text":"Arizona Burger was delicious, fresh off the grill when I got it. It was hot in terms of temperature and spiciness, so it was pretty stupid of me to walk there and back from my office in the Phoenix heat for it. 

OK value overall. I'll definitely be back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"I absolutely (heart) smashburger!! This is definately a place worth raving about.

We have never been to this place before but decided to give it a try since it was on our way to the movies.

This is what I call a BOMB burger joint!! You know that you found a great burger place when you feel that you need a freakin' bib in order to eat there. 

Everything is absolutely delicious and fresh. Meat, veggies, fries... Mushroom and Swiss Burger is a burger worth trying - more than once.

smashburger will now be on our regular rotation! ;)"}
{"text":"Great staff, juicy burgers,  hot fries. Oreo shake snd salted caramel shake were amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered a multi grain bun, got potato . I went to unwrap my burger and got grease all over me, the burger had no flavor tonight. Shakes were great."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good,a little overpriced,hence only 3 stars. Love the interior,service was great,lot of options(mushroom swiss burger,sweet fries)give it a shot!"}
{"text":"This place has come along since opening. They have mastered customer service and everyone there seems to be great at customer service now. Food came out in a reasonable time and it tasted great!!! Nice work Smash Burger"}
{"text":"This may be my last time eating Smash Burger at the Las Sendas location. It was very exciting when we 1st got this well known chain restaurant. It was excellent for maybe the first year. It's as though management walked away thinking business ran itself and hired a bunch of high-school students that don't care about quality, cleanliness, and providing professional service. It's too bad what has happened to this establishment."}
{"text":"Ordered a large patty but it came with a small size bun because they are a very cheap establishment. Burger fell apart. Just a terrible experience eating here."}
{"text":"Omg! Can't get enough of their spicy Baja big size burger! I always order it with extra fresh jalepenos (never extra charge) and a beer for an addtl $1.00! Can't beat the filling deal. The summerlin lake mead location is my fave they have the friendliest staff and always clean and air conditioned ;) also sweet potato fries are to die for. A treat once a month as its not the healthiest but everyone needs a cheat day!"}
{"text":"Smashburger, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways: I love your rosemary sweet potato fries. I love your AZ burger and the fresh jalapeños. I love your grilled AZ salad- freaking awesome. And lastly, My kids would kill/maim for your new mint Oreo shake. Smashburger, we're going to have a long and lovely relationship."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great tasting burgers. Loved the sweet potato fries. I will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit EVER to Smashburger. The cooks did a great job. The food was very good, and the girl working the register was very kind. Although the food is a big part of the experience, the customer service is of equal importance. 

The mod, who I believe was named Matthew, however was VERY unfriendly and not only to the customer, but also to the other employees. I couldn't help but notice him repeatedly give the cashier dirty looks when she walked by. What kind of manager is that? One that makes the customers and other employees uncomfortable? One who makes you feel unwelcome? If you're having a bad day leave it out the door before you come to work.... I can only imagine how he treats his coworkers when the customers aren't around. Unprofessional, unfriendly, cell phone in hand texting..... I don't understand how these unprofessional teenage jerks get hired for management."}
{"text":"This place is consistently yummy.  The truffle mushroom burger rocks!  Fries are great - friendly staff. Great for the whole family."}
{"text":"Since the beginning of reviews and the entire star system, I've struggled with what precisely each star means. One is obvious, as is 5. At what point does a restaurant go between 2 and 4?

2 may be overly harsh, but I *have* experienced better than Smashburger. 4 is right out. I can't imagine ever wanting to go back. 3 being \"A-OK\" felt right, but until I ate at Smashburger I didn't know precisely what that meant.

It meant the food was ok. I wouldn't crave it or think of it ever again. It didn't offend me.

The service was ok. It's self-service, not remarkable.

The restaurant was ok. It's decorated in a way that says \"We want to be fun\" but also \"We don't want to work too hard\".

The pricing is ok. Any higher and I would complain. Any lower and it would be more fitting, thus making me think it's better value.

The value is ok. I got enough food, it seemed a bit on the pricey side but not enough to make me question my sanity.

Smashburger: The very embodiment of a 3-star experience. I can't imagine going back, but not because it's bad, it's just not good."}
{"text":"Excellent, slightly crispy on the edges, smash sauce adds that kick. Love the bun. Absolutely must must have a milkshake here! I've had all the flavours - Saskatoon berry and Oreo are my top picks. Great yam fries. Don't leave without tying the different ice teas. You won't be disappointed at all!!"}
{"text":"Bad service....everyone had their food and I waited 20 minutes and had to ask...I also said no cheese and they added cheese... The manager was hesitant and kind o rude at first, but did refund my money"}
{"text":"First time visiting Smashburger, I was impressed by the cleanliness of the place. The staff seem to make it a point of clearing the tables promptly and keeping the floors swept up. The menu seemed a bit limited save the build your own burger option, which in hindsight, I probably should've tried. Instead, I had the truffle mushroom burger, my GF had the bacon ranch burger. We also shared an order of fried pickles and Smash fries. The guy at the register was nice enough to comp our drinks when we ordered. Maybe he could tell it was our first time there, but whatever the reason it was a nice gesture. Unfortunately, now come the negatives. The food overall was just OK. Jack In The Box's Butter Mushroom burger was better than my truffle mushroom. My GF didn't remark on her burger one way or the other. We've had better fried pickles too. These were a bit greasy and the breading was tasteless. The Smash fries were similarly unimpressive. We really thought the thyme and sea salt would add a punch of flavor, but it proved not to be the case. The quality of the fries themselves were subpar as well. The saving grace for the meal was the fact that we could immediately tell that the burger patties themselves were fresh and well seasoned. It's the first time I've had a burger, fast-food or otherwise, that tasted like a home-made burger.

We will try Smashburger again, hopefully the build your own option will prove to live up to all the rave reviews given to this place. Props to the friendly and hard working staff."}
{"text":"I can't vouch for their burgers...but I eat the veggie burgers and chicken sandwiches and they rock. Interesting, yummy menu which includes sweet potato fries and BEER:) The service at the Las Vegas Blvd SW location is very good."}
{"text":"Hamburger fries and peanut butter shake r great.  Service was great.  Peanut butter shake was the best"}
{"text":"I only tried their regular burger, not any of their special offerings. The burger is a nice size and very tasty. I still give a slight edge to In N Out, though. What I did love here was the sweet potato fries. They are outstanding and the flavor is amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered two of the Black Bean Burgers with Mushroom / Swiss as well as fried pickles and poutine.

Issues:
One Black Bean burger was fine, the other was sooo over salted you could not eat it and even an hour later my tounge was still fuzzy.

When I took it back into the restaurant the front counter staff were really friendly but the cook was very dismissive, which pissed me off.

The fried pickles were disgusting

The poutine had no cheese and the gravy was barely enough to cover the fries and what little cheese there was.

I will not be going back, mostly due to the attitude from the chef as to the reality of the problem, anytime a place dismissed the customers feedback will not get my business twice."}
{"text":"I decided to try Smash burger.  They \"smash\" a round ball of meat onto the stove to form the burger patty.  I guess press down burger is not a catchy name for them.

I ordered my standard burger and fries.  I waited 10 minutes before I received my food.  The burger was quite good and the fries were amazing.  If you are going to have the food to go, I would recommend calling ahead to avoid the long wait."}
{"text":"Good burger, but a little pricy.  Nice decor and good service, but this place just didn't do it for me.  Only been there once and I've never felt the desire to go back.  But if you're in the area and want a burger (and have a few bucks to spare), they're pretty good."}
{"text":"First time here. Fast, friendly - reasonably priced.  I'm next door to best buy waiting to get a new stereo installed in my car. I love the convenience of a chicken sandwich for lunch in under 6 min.  Very fast.  Very good. Will be back"}
{"text":"This location started out great, but has gone hill a lot in the past year. The past 3 times out order was made wrong, and it took 3 times as long to fix it as it did to bring it out in the first place. Walls are dirty, holes or teared wallpaper on some. Staff ranges from frazzled to aloof to couldn't care less. Today our burgers were brought out (wrong) and was told our fries would be right up. 8 minutes later our fries showed up, still missing out shake. Caramel shake came out with crusty chocolate on the glass. Place had flies and Mosquitos coming in every time the door opened. Burgers had no flavor, only half my bun had sauce. I don't mean like only the top or bottom had sauce, no I mean literally only HALF of the top bun had sauce on it. So I cut my burger in half and only one half was moderately tasty (didn't know they didn't know how to use a spatula until I ate the ok side). Smash fries were pure oil & burnt herbs.

Seriously SmashBurger, you aren't the only quick place in the lot any more, step up or step out. You sell burgers & fries, how can you mess up so much, so often!??!"}
{"text":"I always come to this location and I was very disappointed this time around. The manager took our order and we asked to eat in but he still entered in our order to go. So by the time they figured out that it was our order and took it out of the bag the food was cold. It also had ketchup on the burgers when we asked for no ketchup."}
{"text":"I love burgers, I have burgers about 5 times a week. Today was my first Smashburger, it was great I will definitely be back and recommend them."}
{"text":"Great burgers
Good Fries
Friendly staff and atmosphere. Next to 24 hours fitness.. 
My post work out meal. Yeah, I now...its counter productive."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time yesterday and all I can say is no need to go back. had the Mushroom Swiss Burger with Smash Fries. Burger was okay, but I've had better (actually much better) for less. Smash Fries  were good, but not enough to equal what I paid for them. One of the other reviewers used the word trendy and that is same term my circle of friends uses in a derogatory sense. Smash Burger wants to be the Starbucks of hamburger joints (you know cool hangout where you pay too much for what you get because you are cool). Loud music, Check, Overpriced food and drink. Check People on laptops/cell phones by themselves acting cool. Check Save your money and your eardrums, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Every time we come here, part of our order is missing or subpar quality. 

Today, I placed an online order around 7 pm for a total of 5 sandwiches/burgers and 5 sides, all ranging from regular fries, tots, haystack onions, and sweet potato fries. To my surprise, the order was ready when we arrived, and I watched the team member finish bagging up the order. It seemed relatively slow for a Saturday night in the lobby. 

 We drive home, I start divvying up the bags, and of course, one of the order's sides was missing. We call, they say we can come back and pick up the missing item. The rest of the family eats while we are gone and some liked their sandwiches. 

However, something is going on with portions here. Half of my order was comprised of regular sized burgers, and the others were ordered as \"big\" burgers. The \"big\" burgers were no bigger than a $1-2 burger from any fast food place, McD's, BK etc, but for $7-8!!!

I ordered a crispy buffalo chicken sandwich with no tomato and a cheese substitution, but I wish I had ordered it without the lettuce too, as the piece on this sandwich was brown and more wilted than it could have been just from the ride home. I watched the orders for in-house dining go out from the kitchen window while waiting for our order, and every one had a big, bright green, crisp looking piece of lettuce. Kind of a bummer that to-go orders are held to different standards.

We really wanted to try this place again, and thought the last time we ate here was a fluke, but were reminded that it wasn't.

TL;DR We spent $50 and had to make two trips to in order to correctly receive what we paid for only to be disappointed in the long run."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I ordered a shake and fries as a snack. The shake had far to much milk, it was more chocolate milk than chocolate shake. The fries didn't arrive for 10 minutes, and I wish they'd never shown up. They were greasy, tired, and deeply disappointing. We receives a $5 certificate as an apology, but gave it to another patron since we will not be returning. HOWEVER, the staff was friendly and the manager was very responsive. Hopefully we just arrived on a bad day."}
{"text":"So a few weeks ago I go to their restaurant at 20th and Camelback and order a couple of burgers and tell the cashier that I would like a shake. She says, they are out of ice cream. OK Friday night and your out of Ice Cream. While waiting for my food I ask the manger on duty and he says that they have Ice Cream but it is frozen and cannot use it. What a bull answer. I then write and email to their corporate email and get an instant response that someone will contact me. Well here it is three or more weeks later and no response. You see what it really was, the restaurant was busier than I ever saw it and did not have anyone that could make the shakes so they gave a bogus answer thinking that would be it. It would have been it if someone at corporate cared enough to respond to me. Guess I just have to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm just going to go ahead and say that this is my favorite burger place. Whew, glad I got that out there. Now on to why...

(a) The meat itself is substantial, flavorful, juicy, and always hot. 

(b) They offer several different bun varieties, which is unique and awesome. My favorite is the chipotle bun.

(c) There are lots and lots of topping options. Some standard, some that challenge the status quo a bit (fried egg, avocado, mushrooms come to mind).

(d) AMAZING side dishes. I think I have my perfect \"create your own\" burger down, so I get that every time, but I always have a hard time deciding which side to get. Rosemary Smashfries? Sweet potato fries? Haystack onions (with yummy dipping sauce)? Fried pickles? All of these are seriously delicious. 

(e) Great service. Sometimes the food takes a little but longer, but it's usually very fast. And while you can of course be hit or miss with the staff that's there, some of them are amazingly helpful and friendly.

Throw in a great atmosphere and you've got yourself one fantastic meal. And, unlike some other burger places, I don't leave feeling greasy or \"weighed down\" by the food - just full, happy, and ready to go back the next day.

Smashburger FTW!"}
{"text":"Great burger, my date liked her shake. A bit on the pricey side for two people with nothing really big or special in regards to what's offered or the quantity but good quality ingredients. 

I haven't gone again and found a few other burger places I personally prefer better but these folks were fine. Definitely a place to try if you're looking at new burger places."}
{"text":"So sad. I was looking forward to burgers all day so we came to this location. The people were so rude. It ruined the experience. Go to another location. Hopefully the people will be better there.  The food was ok..... Not worth 30$"}
{"text":"My first encounters with Smashburger started in Minnesota. We have had a couple dining experiences down in Tempe. I have to say....for some unknown reason, this location just tasted better. I ordered the All American while my husband had the Arizona. Both were above and beyond any hamburger experience to date. The bun was fresh, lettuce was green not white, jalapenos had some heat and were fresh, the beef was crunchy and juicy at the same time. The fried egg was excellent too. The double chocolate malt was to die for.The Manager was hilarious and accommodating. He really cared what the customer's thought.  All the employees seem enthusiastic about their jobs and the food.  Strangely, my husband's wedding ring slid off his finger by the napkins and the employee turned it in!!! That's amazing!!! As we left with a smile and stuffed, I was already craving my next hamburger from Smashburger, particularly this location.  

Thanks you for a great dinner!!"}
{"text":"I think it is despicable that this location refused to use a coupon that I had for $5 off of $10.  The \"manager\" said it was supposed to only be at 2 locations, even though it did not say that on the coupon on my phone app.  This just puts the icing on the cake for my previous negative experiences at this location!  I guess I will not be coming back to this location EVER!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this smashburger.  But I regret ignoring the other low star posts about this location. I came in and had very clearly and calmly asked for no salt to be added.  Their cashiers screen clearly stated no salt added to my orders. When I opened my to-go order at home, I couldnt believe that NOT ONLY WAS THERE SALT, MY BURGERS WERE INTENTIONALLY COATED IN SALT. I had to throw out my meal as it was not edible. It's not that someone in the kitchen somehow did not see my request and then added a normal amount of salt to my order. It was that someone actually saw my request and then blatantly decided to coat my burgers in salt. I'll post the picture as proof."}
{"text":"Burger was a solidly good burger; loved the Smash sauce (or whatever the house sauce is called). The Smash fries, though, are what to get! Absolutely unique and delicious. The atmosphere outside with the patio tables and lights is perfect for a nice, summer evening.  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Just moved my daughter from one dorm room to another and needed something fast and easy... this place was right next door to In n Out... it's not In n Out for taste and value, but I did enjoy the chipotle sauce and the bun... I ordered the kids meal because I like getting the \"small\" burger... the size is more like In n Out's and just right for a late hour snack... with fries and a small drink... a good change of pace.  My son got the mushroom swiss with smash fries (garlic fries), it looked good for a gourmet burger... this place reminds me of 5 guys in price and quality... mmmmmm... I guess I'm more of an In n Out type... although I do enjoy your \"Sin City Burger\"... that's a 4 star burger for sure... I also found out you can order any signature burger from around the country, it's just not going to be a menu item... good to know next time I'm moving my daughter out..."}
{"text":"Don't know what the hype is about this place. Burgers are more like little sliders. Burgers were ok tasting but way over priced for what you get!  $30 for two small burgers, 2 regular drinks and one order of fried pickels."}
{"text":"Very pleasant burger joint for the more sophisticated taste buds!  You form a queue to order, fill your drink and grab a seat.  Staff bring your food out and even bus your table.  Our family ordered smash fries and regular fries, kids' cheeseburger, grilled cheese, an Arizona burger, standard cheeseburger and a salty-caramel milkshake.  All of it was delicious!  Kids ate it up.  I love the Arizona burger--just the perfect amount of fresh crunch and spice. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food here is good, although I rarely eat the hamburger. Both the crispy, and the Cajun chicken sandwiches are good. The chili dogs are great, but a little spendy."}
{"text":"We all know how Smashburger is. This is a great location in terms of speed of order taking, accuracy of order and friendliness of staff. The black bean burger is tasty baja style. Buffalo chicken sandwich is another great option."}
{"text":"I have tried this location over and over, giving them many chances to get their act together. One person on the register on a Friday night? Yea. Took 30 minutes to get through, the bag with fries and tater tots was leaking grease all over the counter, and ... I had ordered online, but didn't pay until I got there - big mistake. They claimed the order had been paid for by someone else, then they fixed it, but it took 10 minutes to fix the order and get a new total for me. 

Orders are almost alway wrong at this location. Like if I order online and change what comes on a burger, it's never right. They do stuff like leave the BBQ sauce off a BBQ cheddar burger. 

Everyone that picks up a go order goes off to the side to go through it, I guess because they get it wrong so often. I have emailed complaints several times, but I don't want a coupon - I want fast service and the order be correct. How hard is that? See \"In and Out\" if you want some training."}
{"text":"My sister-n-law introduced me to Smashburger when I first moved here and was raving about the burgers. So we went several times, and I did love the burgers. Then, I had a burger somewhere on Decatur that tasted fishy and that was the last time I ate there a few years ago. I decided to give them another try recently. There still not as great as my first experiences and are just OK. I don't think I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Smashburger is great place for a quick and delicious lunch! The place was clean, the employees were nice and the burgers were cooked perfectly and fast...can't as for much more! 

Oh and the fried pickles were good too!"}
{"text":"We ate there two days in a row and plan to go back for round three...food is amazing and the staff is even more amazing!"}
{"text":"decent burgers I had the mushroom burger was good enough not very filling. onion rings were awfull. very very salty and were more like shredded onions with a coating. hubby had the make your own burger and smash fries. once again very very salty. sorry to say place didnt live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers and I love the smash fries. Employees are very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Had an Avocado Club with the Smashburger. Very tasty, plenty of Sliced Avocado!. I am signed up for their rewards program so I received a free side for Father's Day offer. Smash Fries are the thin fries, and I like them."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night. The food was fresh but in my opinion it wasn't exactly worth $13. Nice restaurant though."}
{"text":"Killer burgers as they smash the competition! Wow! Awesome! 100% premium beef. This is not like other beef at the other burger joints in town. This is the finest quality beef. I finally made it there to try it out and I am glad that I did. The fries and sauce were great as well. Big burger, fries, soda all for about $9. It is certainly worth every penny. Just writing this review makes my mouth water. You order up at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The area that it is in is very affluent and land leases are expensive. I just hope that they can make it financially."}
{"text":"So bomb! Never disappoints. Staff is always really down to earth and nice, cooks are always on point."}
{"text":"Scrumptious SmashFries!
Delicious bacon burger as well, but I expected larger for the price. One thing that has GOT TO GO is that gross BLARGH \"ranch dressing.\" It's that horrible Heinz abomination that comes from a hand pump container. Saw it at BK, wrote about it in a review."}
{"text":"Another great place for an excellent tasting burger! About $6.00 for a 1/3 pound burger and $8.00 for a 1/2 pound burger, and many options for your burger.  Smash Burger has a few options for side items too. But their signature side items are the smash fries or sweet potato fries. The smash fries are amazing and will set you back a mere $1.99. Altogether a meal set me back around $10.00. Pretty comparable to other \"gourmet burger\" joints like Five Guys."}
{"text":"Well I was taken out the other day and the person who knew I love a good burger suggested this place, being that I never heard of it I was like sure ok.

WOW is all I can say, the menu was very interesting and it all looked and sounded good. 

So I order the BBQ, Bacon & Chedder, and a order of Smash Fries (French Fries with oil and some seasoning)

I go and get my drink and sit down and the order is brought to my table.

Burger was cooked to the way I asked for the and the fries were awesome.

The burger was very tasty and not dry (People who kvetch about grease, HELLO a burger is supposed to be greasy, this is not a heath food choice!!! and to the reviewer complaining about her Veggie Burger, really? why are you getting something that looks like a burger? Go have a salad.)

The food was served quite quickly and seating was not a issue, I want to go back to this place soon."}
{"text":"I have been to the Sahara location MANY times and even chose to go there for my birthday dinner. I was excited to see this location closer to my house - loaded up the car and headed out for family dinner. NOT GOING BACK EVER I think the kitchen staff needs to be educated on oil temperature or something because the onion straws that I expected to be crunchy and yummy aka \"Smashburger style\" were a pile of wet greasy yuck. I returned them and the staff was friendly but then served me a basket of the same slop only hotter this time. The burger was so-so and the ice tea was murky and unpleasant. Something is horribly wrong at this location. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location. And both of my visits here were phenomenal. The service here is great; everyone is polite, always looking out for you. And the food is amazing! I ordered the \"BBQ, Bacon, & Cheddar\" along with regular fries and a drink. First off, the burger is great, freshly made, and is the best in the area. The fries gave the burger that 'extra' flavor that was needed to complete your meal. Lastly, they had XXX Vitamin Water to add a nice healthy touch. Overall, my visit was awesome and I will be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly staff. Love coming here with my family. I recommend the Sin City burger."}
{"text":"Three adults and four kids in our party. Kids had burgers! All enjoyed! I had the cobb salad ( with fried egg on top) which was excellent! Thought prices were reasonable and food was good! Long line to order cause it is a popular place! Close to Harkins. Decent amount of seating. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are usually very good.  The only issue is sometimes the toppings are just thrown on top of the burger which makes it very difficult to eat without making a huge mess and falling apart.  My favorite burger is the original smashburge - it has their signature sauce, lettuce, onion, tomatoes, ketchup & mustard.  

The location is great and their fries are usually really good as well!"}
{"text":"Smashburger has THE best burgers I've ever had at a fast food place, hands down.  Yes, they are a little bit more expensive- a combo can cost you around $10.  However, it is worth every penny.  Their burgers are delicious, and you can build them in any way you want.  Their smash fries and the sweet potato fries are good, although I will say that their fried onions side isn't anything to write home about.  The ambiance is great and the staff is friendly- I am definitely a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Got bumped from my original flight home, so used the spare time to find a good burger. I must agree with several other reviewers that the burger here is a notch above those I've eaten at other airport terminals. The Smash fries are OUTSTANDING (Rosemary, garlic and olive oil)! The free drink refills are a nice touch as well."}
{"text":"First timer, okay food! Nothing too special. Food a little over priced for the quality. Friendly staff and very clean environment. Wouldn't come back if I have more then 2 in my group.  the two of us costed $35   And my friend left hungry still?"}
{"text":"I heard the commercials, and all I could think about was a burger.  Finally I had the chance to go, and.... eh.  The meat seemed too seasoned, if that's possible, and I didn't love the bun.  The fries were really good though!  I liked that there was a variety of burgers on the menu, and I wished I enjoyed spicy things enough to try the Arizona burger.  For the price of a burger/fry combo, I expected a little better."}
{"text":"This place has great food!  I love their sin city burger and the fries are mmm delicious!  They even have sweet potato fries. And there are a few chicken entrees for the anti-beef crowd.  Everything is made to order.  The place gets busy but they still move pretty fast. Service is friendly and efficient.  The dining room is kinda small and feels cramped when they're busy. Overall its a great spot to grab a burger and I prefer Smash Burger over In n Out."}
{"text":"Clean and easy to find. We were greeted by the young man as soon as we walked in. I ordered sweet potato fries and a mushroom swiss burger with gluten-free bun ($1 extra).  I don't normally eat hamburgers, but theirs is pretty good. Nicely seasoned. With a fountain drink it was about $12.00 which was reasonable for the size of the burger. :)"}
{"text":"Quality  of the food goes down..when you order for take out. Ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger.  What I got...... was this! No bacon & no BBQ sauce.   No one wants to drive all the way back when your order is wrong.   Fries..no bueno! Fries anywhere  are always better in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hits the spot every damn time. No worries no complains. I love their burger. Wife approves it, kids also approves it. Def goin back for the 3rd time."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait, even if there is not much of a line.  We have ate at this location over 20 times.  The last one was the worst.  I do mean the last.  Manager apologized for delay and promised free sides for waiting.  We decided to go ahead and wait since the free sides were going to be included.  We finally ordered.  They charged us for the sides anyways.  We went there instead of a restaurant because of time.  We were there about 35 minutes total and took food to go.  Food is usually pretty good, but not worth the wait.  This was usually one of my choices to eat, even though the wife said it takes to long.  I can't argue that it is not that long anymore."}
{"text":"Smash burger doesn't disappoint me. Burgers are always on point. I just found out today that there's this spot. I don't have to drive all the way to Tempe. This spot is only 2+ miles away from me. This is one of my cheat meal spot. Wifey and kids loves it. 
Over all experience was great. Everyone is helpful."}
{"text":"We went and ordered 4 milkshakes and our server was Nick who was very nice. The milkshakes were 10/10 I come to Arizona from California once a year to have them from smashburger. I will be coming back when I can."}
{"text":"The food was perfectly ok.  Nothing stood out as phenomenal or craveable.

My major issue is the fries. Seriously, if you are a hamburger and fry joint - please make fresh fries!  There is no excuse for frozen fries in a place like this. I love thin fries, but I would rank McDonald's fries as better than theirs!  ."}
{"text":"Love Smashburger, but we were a little disappointed at this one today...  At order time, they were out of supplies and couldn't make any milk shakes. Tried to order fried pickles as a side, but those were not available either. 

The store itself was not very clean either. Debris on many tables, trash and napkins on the floor.  Tables need better wipe downs. Puddles under the iced tea dispensers. Just not real kept up. The staff was attentive and friendly, but based on these items, this location would not be our first choice."}
{"text":"Took my wife there for lunch. The place is clean and service is pretty fast getting the food out. Burger meat is a little greasy which adds a good flavor. French fries are very thin cut. Overall the food is average and a little spendy for what you get. Kinda a combination of a fast food meets restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good grilled chicken sandwiches; however, I'll never return to this location. I put in a complaint, but never heard anything in response from about a month ago. The last time I ordered takeout, I ordered a chicken sandwich and the veggie frites. It wasn't until I got home that I looked at my order...the carrots for the veggie frites were literally baby carrots barely cooked and rolled around in some oil. It was so disgusting. If you've had the veggie frites before, you know that they cut carrots into the shape of fries and add green beans, as well. (See the photo of what they gave me.) I wouldn't have minded receiving all green beans if they were out of the regular carrots, but nobody at Smashburger bothered to mention anything. Lazy and bad customer service. Giving 2 stars and not 1, though, because the chicken sandwich was good."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden place that has yet to fail. The service here is really excellent and the food in my opinion has the right amount of portions. You have to try the Spicy chipotle bun when you get a burger if you like a little spice. This is much a better burger place than 5 guys (grease pit in a brown paper bag).

Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Loved my burger:  Hot and juicy with great condiments.   Served fast, done perfectly and loved the egg roll!   I got the classic burger, as I was really hungry for a good burger.   Also got the sweet potato fries which were okay, but not my favorite.

Order taker and waitress both very polite, and made the visit enjoyable.  

The restaurant wasn't crowded but steady, no hurry to eat and get out.    Nice decor, clean and well maintained.  

They serve Coca Cola Products.  Didn't try the shakes but it seems they have several interesting combinations, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Ok place.  Fried Banana peppers were great.  The buffalo chicken sandwich was ok.  Classic burger was average.  Five Guys is better."}
{"text":"Amazing place - It's just a small little fast food joint at first, but once you get a look at the menu and have some of their food, you know it's special. 

You can get your burger in one of dozens of different arrangements - you can go healthy with a veggie patty (not as good as it should have been) or grilled chicken, or have a fried chicken or a smashed (hence the name) beef patty with any and all toppings. 

Where it really gets fun are the side dishes. Their chili is made from their lean burger beef and is very good. They also have rosemary fries, sweet potato fries, veggie frites (non-breaded carrots, green beans and asparagus pan fried and seasoned), fried pickle slices (my personal fave) and several other choices. Drinks are self-serve so you can have all the refills you need to wash down the goodness.

Very sweet people, without fail. Every time I've been in, the people working there are friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Helpful, friendly staff that does a nice job.  Food is pretty good, although I keep trying the same two things over and over (I guess that confirms it's good).

I can't get on board with the whole gourmet burger thing that has spread like a cancer through every westernized country on the planet, but I like Smashburger and had my girlfriend who hadn't been there tell me recently that I must have mentioned that we should go there about 1,000 times.  Has to count for something."}
{"text":"A pretty good burger for the price. Their fries are far better though. The beers available are pretty good and their shakes are even better than those!

If you're looking for a cheap burger, the In-n-Out across the street is probably better. If you're looking for great fries and a shake, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"A really tasty hamburger and a delicious whole grain roll. Smash fries with oil and spices are unique and very good. My complaint is that a pretty small portion of food cost me over $12. It was not fast either."}
{"text":"Really good burgers and fries, too bad I hate going there now because my boyfriend dumped me here lol. Keep doing your thing guys the restaurant is great. Get a classic smash burger, can't go wrong. The only thing I don't love is that the sweet tea usually tastes kinda stale and syrupy. Other than that, great place to go for a quick bite with fast, nice service."}
{"text":"With so many deluxe burger joints around there is stiff competition to go around.  Last time we ate there the burger was so greasy it was hard to eat. Nothing special really and I would debate if I was going to go back.  A step above drive thru, a step below any of the local burger joints. I suppose if you are wanting to get in and out quickly, this would be a good choice."}
{"text":"I have been to a different location before to order to go and was not impressed with them getting my entire order mixed up and charging me for extra toppings I did not receive! The attitude from the person rudely rushing me through ordering my first time there when there was no one behind me in line on a slow Wednesday morning left something to be desired...

Today was an entirely different story! Melinda was absolutely Smashing :) she made sure we were able to substitute a black bean burger in the kids meal for my vegetarian son. Our food was ready in record time and everything was just as we ordered it. Not only did she check on us to make sure everything was perfect but she also came back with coupons for a free side for next time. She definitely changed my opinion of the level of service they provide, Melinda was extremely nice and seemed to be cleaning absolutely everything in sight as well as taking care of customers! The truffle mayo was nice on its own but the black bean burger was so flavorful itself that it kind of masked its flavor. I would recommend that as a dip for fries to fully taste the great flavor. Fried pickles...need I say more!?! Superb food compared to most places having generic frozen veggie burgers! The meat eater in our family was very happy with the super spicy burger they have on the menu. He got the buffalo fries, they were good but not very spicy, more flavorful than anything."}
{"text":"So, after all the fuss, we've tried it three times now and it's really just \"OK\".   The fries have been pretty gross and soggy and undercooked everytime, don't like the rosemary and oil on the garlic fries.  I do really like the Spicy Baja Burger, but it is inconsistent.  My husband loves the Sin City Burger. 

It is $30 to feed two adults and two kids with just one order of fries and one drink, so if we really are wanting a smash burger, we no longer waste time/money on the fries and drinks.  I also don't understand why they put each burger into a seperate bag, and then all of those bags into one gigantic bag - perhaps the prices would come down to normal if they wasted less paper, and it would be much better for the environment.   I have to throw so much garbage away when we eat there! 

One final complaint, the bathrooms were nasty when we went in last time, seems like there are a lot of people working there, some of them should be assigned to keeping things clean! 

 It's a good thing the burgers are pretty good, it's the only thing that saved my review."}
{"text":"Not even close to In-N-Out quality but burger is good like your grandma makes in her skillet.  However, the patty is a little dry. Probably since the \"100% Angus Beef is smashed on the grill\".  Bad technique for burgers since smashing patties squeezes the juices from them. French fries are very unspectacular.  Dinning room is your basic strip mall sub-leased space but decent decor.  Great shakes with real Haagen-Dazs ice cream. One area where SB separates itself from the others is they have iced mugs for their root beer and have beer and wine as well.  Was expecting more because of the hype, but burger was pretty good anyway.  Not on the same level as In-N-Out or Five Guys but definitely better than your normal fast food burger joint."}
{"text":"I arrived at about 2:20PM and there were 11 folks ahead of me in line.  Were they busy? NO

The idiot behind the register had his back turned to the growing line (now out the door) while he attended to making milkshakes.  After 10 minutes, I walked out.

Management: Two middle fingers straight at you for not running your restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went for a quick lunch and had a mix of foods - salad, black bean veggie burger and a kids regular burger. The burgers were great even the kids burger and the black bean burger was flavorful! I'd recommend burgers over their salads. 

Good place for lunch and overall good service and experience."}
{"text":"So update on my previous visit and post. After having a bad experience the manager sent me a message asking for the chance to correct or mixed up order. When we returned the staff was very helpful and got everything correct and made sure to go out of their way to provide excellent customer service.

Bottom line, good food, great customer service, I will return and tell others to go as well."}
{"text":"Brought my fam here. The burgers were good but I wouldn't go craving this place. It's an establishment where I would visit once every year or two just for convenience."}
{"text":"HEy it's not bad Wife says her burger was great. Mine was pretty decent good enough for 4 stars and very juicy!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! I ordered a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries and it was DELICIOUS. My date ordered a chicken burger (she has a stomach ulcer so super greasy beef is a no-no) and the rosemary fries. OH MY GOD, the rosemary fries were AMAZING! I couldn't stop stealing food from her. Next time I'll definitely order that. I want to try their shakes as well and all their salads looked delicious. 

I usually feel sick after a greasy meal like this but I actually felt pretty great - I think their quality is much higher than elsewhere and for a pretty affordable price. The portion sizes they give you are also more realistic than other places that give you heaping mounds of food that will probably kill you.

They're definitely going for a bit of a more upscale feeling - waiters bus your tray and the manager asks if you liked your meal, etc. Unusual for a burger joint. Service was prompt but the energy behind it didn't feel very genuine - they seemed a little sad. Maybe because there's not much of an opportunity to tip in a place like this...? Even though the employees clearly deserve it."}
{"text":"Food was good but the ice dispenser was absolutely nasty. You're going to get someone sick."}
{"text":"I ate here when it first opened and I really enjoyed the spicy, Arizona Cobb salad.  I also splurged and got the chili cheese fries, which were absolutely amazing.  I'm sure they are not the healthiest side option but they are crispy fries topped with chili, cheese and fresh sliced jalapenos, which add an extra kick to an already delicious combo.

The staff was very friendly and our food came out very quickly.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I had so high expectations of this place that I left pretty sad.

Nothing to remember. Lame fries, lame burger and uber messy.

And this location in particular has no parking (besides meters) and no bathroom. Fail."}
{"text":"Burgers were ok just small and way over priced. Very skimpy on the fries. Way over priced not worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible service for expensive meal, was crowded and kids behind the counter and register had no idea what they were doing burger came out with nothing on it and they walked around restaurant with my shake trying to figure out who it belonged to 15 minutes later, I will never go back there"}
{"text":"Great service! Never been here before and after being charged $9 for a Arizona Burger, don't know if I will. It's clean. Hip. 
The burger was good- not great. I've had better at In-N-Out and Culver's. The burger was very messy. I feel as though I wore half of it on my business shirt (grrr!!!)
Next time you order a burger here be sure to tell them not to put the sauce between the bun and lettuce with a tomato beneath that. This is how customers wear the burger before they eat it. what a mess.
 And whoever thought this place was cheap to eat was wrong. If I had a burger+fries+drink it would have ran me close to $16. That my friend is insane."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of smashburger but this location is awful. I'm not a person that complains much but their service is bad enough to make me create a yelp account. I've had 5 prior bad experiences at this location but kept coming in because I love smashburger and the other locations are amazing top to bottom. I placed an order to go and the place wasn't busy but it took me over 40 minutes to get out of there. After 25 minutes they told me they dropped my burger and told cook to remake it and he forgot. The guy who is telling me this is laughing as he apologizes and said my burger is being remade. That's right...just my burger. So I get my order and the burger is freshly made but my fries are over 30 minutes old and are cold. I am done eating at this location"}
{"text":"Great addition to Kingsley. We have not dined in so this is solely based on take out. WE LOVE THEIR BURGERS! Always fresh and juicy, never dry or over cooked. I am one of those that usually take off the pickles, onions first thing and tomatoes half way through devouring my burgers. And this is the ONLY burger I eat straight through enjoying every juicy bite because their ingredients are fresh. They have pretty awesome tater tots too. Great change up from fries I'd say. Crispy and not tasting like it was soaked in grease. And they have a flavored vitamin drink on tap that is quite tasty."}
{"text":"First time walking into Smashburger, and my last. 

I've been doing Crossfit for a month and two weeks now. So I've been eating very clean. I allowed myself a cheat meal today, since I've been doing so well. I figured I'd check out Smashburger, being that I was at Desert Ridge. What a disaster! 

I got a simple cheese burger with fries. The burger itself was jammed with salt, I didn't even want to eat it any more. I mean, did they unload the entire salt mine on that single patty?? 

I'm only giving this place two stars because the cashier was very friendly. Otherwise, it would've only been one star. 

I might have had a jacked up patty... however, I will not be returning. 

Wasted my dang cheat day!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to get stingy with my stars. This burger should be a 5, the atmosphere is still fast food and usually I wouldn't give fast food 2 stars. So great job Smash Burger, you just upgraded to a 4."}
{"text":"Horrible! The only decent thing they had was sweet potato fries, that's it. The service was not good, they were out of iced tea and needed a few things changed in the pop machine so I ended up just drinking water. Our food came out really fast, which is normally a good thing, however our regular fries, haystack onions and fried pickles were cold and sitting in oil which leads me to believe that they have been sitting cooked back there for a while. Also the worst part was something is wrong with their door and a slight breeze kept it open and there was at least 20 flies in the restaurant that we could see..I could only imagine how many were actually in the kitchen. Overall it was a waste of money and a terrible experience."}
{"text":"So good, The Colorado Burger is my fave, also there Chicken sandwiches are top notch. Service is always good, and the place is always clean. Unfortunately after eating here, other places like mcd's and jack/box are just blah..... Sad thing is there bout' the same price."}
{"text":"Went again yesterday. Also went around Christmas. 

This Smashburger delivers a delicious product, with quality service, consistently. Let that sink in a bit: my Arizona Big Burger has been prepared and served in the same way. Every. Single. Time. This truly is a commitment to excellence. 

This is a business to keep around. Thank you for hiring good folks who want to cook great burgers and keep customers coming back!"}
{"text":"After hearing a lot about how good this place is, I felt compelled to go against my better judgment. And I was right. I felt dirty after paying $21 for two people. Bachi Burger blows them away at the price point, or go next door to In-n-Out and spend half the money for a better product.

The burgers are maybe a step above Burger King -- dry, grainy beef that gets its only juice from the grease of the grill. No real taste to the meat, though the saving grace was the preparation I ordered with pepper jack, jalapenos and guacamole.

The fries are OK, nothing special. We had the sweet potato fries, which were nicely seasoned but disgustingly greasy. We also ordered the \"veggie frites\", and what a mistake that was. There was no batter, just some vegetables dropped in oil and fried. They tasted exactly like if they hadn't been fried, yet with all the grossness of hot dripping oil. Avoid the veggies and their $4 price tag at all costs."}
{"text":"I went to a Smashburger years ago, did not remember the exact food but remember the food was outstanding. Not this time. A garden salad that cost $3 consisted of a few pieces of lettuce and barely more. My husband ordered a large burger. The burger we got was not large. The place was clean and the staff courteous. The quality of the food was good. Just overpriced for the amount of food we got. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is a good location,but during lunch you have to park far away because, it is a little crazy. That is OK because,you need to walk after all those Calories right. 
 The staff is friendly and very helpful. Since I had never been before they explained everything very nicely.
The menu is quite large for a burger joint.
 I got the Mushroom Burger sin mayo. It was very good. The fries are so so.
Next time I will try the Sweet potato fries or the Smashfries. They look interesting.
Prices are not too bad at all and the place is very clean. Which is very good!
In reading the menu I see you can even build your own Burger.
Choosing your own type of Bun as well. It only took 10 min to get my items to go! I thought that was pretty good as the place was packed and they make it all from Scratch.
I have driven by it 100's of time,so now I am glad that I finally stopped to check it out."}
{"text":"So I went to try the sin city burger that my girlfriend raves about! I had a coupon for a free side so I ordered the sin city burger with the red hot fries to go. The burger was great! The fries unfortunately we're smothered in salt! I tasted no Frank's.... Only salt. I had to throw the fries away. I tried to have a few handfuls of the fries but the salt was too overwhelming. This does not take away from the burger cause I would be back to eat another burger just maybe ask for less salt on the fries or get no fries at all."}
{"text":"Pros:
The burgers are HUGE.
Fries aren't half bad.
I kind of dig the vibe of the place.
VERY good customer service.

Cons:
Kind of overpriced for burgers and fries.
Weird special sauce.

Smashburger is quite the find. I was shocked to realize it was a chain, but that doesn't take away from how good it is. Look forward to going back when I have money to blow."}
{"text":"First time in a Smash Burger, it was indeed very tasty , the patty itself was hot out off the grill and juicy. The Fries were rather small but, very good over all. We went for lunch , we order sat down got some drinks and there it is our food was done under 7 minutes wow !. Go check it out I recommend it ."}
{"text":"Not very happy with the food or the price.  The burgers are way over priced and tasted like shoe leather and the fries were so over cooked they were hard and the onion bits were awful. 32 bucks later we were still hungry. we will never go back there again."}
{"text":"It's fast food right? I had the mushroom Swiss chicken sandwich. Really good, I was pleasantly surprised. It actually tasted like chicken ( not a cardboard box), the arugula and mushrooms were also fresh."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try Smashburger for a while.  My husband, son and I finally made it down to Stonecrest.  Now, I went into Smashburger with a bias for another burger place, BT's Burger Joint.  Have loved that place and we were willing to drive to Steele Creek for the burgers.  Well, after trying the Smashmouth Mushroom Swiss Burger, I am now a convert.  Perfectly grilled, juicy, just enough mushrooms that they were not littering the basket and on an awesome, fresh egg bun.  Sorry BT's.  We've found a place that is closer to home that has superior burgers!!

Of course, this was our first time and I will need to try other items on the menu, but we will definitely be back.  The fries were so-so.  Were told to try the seasoned fries next time and will.

Not a fan of the parking situation, however.  But some things you have to deal with.

In total.  Great burgers!"}
{"text":"I ate again their last night thought I'd give them a second chance since there Burger was so tasty. Had a double meat turkey burger they had to make it custom because they didn't have it on the menu, very good loved it also had a salad the one with blue cheese and cranberries also very good.  I had said in my first review I loved the burger but I thought it was small well the solution to that is to buy the double. So if you're hungry buy the double and don't waste your time with a single or else you'll walk out hungry."}
{"text":"Long lines, long waits, high prices mehhh. I'll go to the Carl's junior across the street or red robin next time I want a burger"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times now- and it was a miss each time.  The staff is friendly and service was good, but the food was lacking. Burger was average and fell apart fairly easily, fries weren't bad, the fried pickles were horrible- so salted you couldn't eat them. Definitely not worth the price and hype."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with Smashburger. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. The hamburger was better than McDonalds but nothing to really brag about. The rosemary garlic fries that I got your old you can taste that in the fries. That's the reason for the three star marking it's just didn't jump out at me as some place I have to go.

Update 10/3/2017
So I went back to give it another try.  I always give an establishment two tries.  Thus time the service was very friendly again and the food was fabulous.   The burger was seasoned and cooked perfectly and the fries tasted fresh.  5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I've been to this fine establishment twice. Conveniently located near my hotel located on the other side of McDonald's lol. A bit pricey for a burger, fries and shake but better than eating at Nasty Ronnies. The burgers are in line with 5 Guys and Fatburger so they're freshly made. I believe I had the classic and it was goooood. The Smash fries with rosemary are incredible. I ordered a large. Tried the Saskatoon berry $5 milkshake which was good but really should be served with a straw made for bubble tea as there are whole Saskatoon berries in it which I figured out was the reason the shake came with a spoon. Was disappointed that my shake, which was to go wasn't filled to the top(maybe you get more if you dine in?) but all in all this is a great place to eat once in awhile. My bill for my order totalled just over $15 which did fill me up so is worth the value."}
{"text":"The sin city burger was AWESOME! And the chili cheese fries tasted way better than they looked. Decent prices & nice atmosphere. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger and fries.  I went with a friend on a Mon. night at about 9:30 - no wait.  We split the 1/2 pound Smashburger and smash fries (regular, not sweet potato), $8.50 total.  Both were incredibly tasty, and being a burger fanatic (I have to have a burger a week, and have tried LOTS in Central Phx) it was among the best - tasty beef, nicely cooked.  The employees were very friendly and welcoming.  Only downside - the bottom bun was flat and soaked.  But a tasty kind of soaked.  Good food.  I would go again."}
{"text":"I am and have been a fan of smash burger for a while and nothing against the food at all. I had Terrible experience there today though. I ordered food for my team and went to pick it up. Got back to work and found we were shorted a burger and the rest of them were not correct. So nobody got what they wanted or ordered and someone didn't get one at all. I tried to call to see if I could run back, which is a 15 min drive just to get there, but no answer and left a message and nobody called back still 40 minutes later. Extremely disappointed mostly just because it was supposed to be a treat for my team that didn't end up that way."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service. Really enjoyed how warm and inviting the place was. The fries were sooooo delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. The food is good but Shay is FABULOUS! !! She is awesome with the customers. I met her for the first time tonight.  I hope her boss or the owners realize what a gem she is! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! My 3 year old granddaughter really likes her too!"}
{"text":"We come here with the whole fam a lot and have never been disappointed. I've recently tried the smash chicken mushroom truffle and feel like someone should have told me how amazing it was soonrt because it's pretty much the most delicious sandwich EVER!!! The only complaint would be the parking is sometimes crazy and getting a table can take awhile because they have such great food and can get quite busy."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Smashburgers, the food was great, service quick and friendly overall a wonderful experience. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used to not be a big fan of Smashburger, but after eating here a few times I've come around. Their burgers (although small) have been very, very good. Super soft, juicy, and tender. Surprisingly so. 

I did take issue with their double patty onion burger because when I did receive it, it was TINY. Came to find out it was 2 kids' patties, so they have marketing issues. BUT it was like $4. So I can't really complain. 

I will say paying full price for a meal feels a bit pricey. Not because of the quality, but because of the quantity - small portions. But they're always having great deals if you sign up for their Smash Club, so that's what makes it worthwhile. 

The staff are always very nice and attentive and this location is nestled in beautiful Kingsley. My only other issues (very small issues) are the tiny paper flags that come on the burgers - cute but I'm not a fan of creating waste for the sake of cute. The other issue are the wire baskets. These are very difficult to cut things in should you need a knife and fork for whatever reason (great presentation though). Overall, I'd really recommend this place as it's the best burger experience I've had in the immediate area."}
{"text":"I'm all about empowering the people so thank you, smashburger, for giving me the option of creating my own burger.  It's always an egg bun for me, with cheddar cheese and all the fixins.  Skip the smash fries.  They don't deliver the herbally-garlic goodness the description promises.  But back to the burger..the patty is always cooked to buttery perfection that makes my mouth water thinking about it.  What's a burger without a milkshake?  The milkshakes are creamy but not so creamy where you can't suck it up with a straw and not to mention, plentiful!  They bring out the metal container they mix it in with whatever portion didn't fit in the cup.  

The only gripe I have is their over attentiveness.  I had a different person walking by our table every 2-3 minutes asking how everything was.  While I appreciate the gesture, it made it really difficult to enjoy my delicious burger and milkshake. 

A little pricier for a burger but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice staff but they wasted my time.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato fries. The fries were hot but the buns on the burger were refrigerator cold. The waitress handled it nicely as the cook remade my order.  

Buns still cold, like a Subway Sandwich. I got a refund and an apology.  Smash Burger has an aggressive radio ad campaign now and this location falls short. The staff really needs to get it together. It's not the cleanest either."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Ordered for my family and received all but one of our burgers.  The worker verified that we were still missing one.  After approx 20 minutes I asked the girl about our missing burger, she said the kitchen was very backed up.  I pointed out the 5 tables all around us that had ordered after us which all now had their orders.  A manager came over and asked me to show the receipt before they made him his order, which I did and then we waited another ten minutes to get his order.  Needless to say, we were all finished and waiting before my son even received his order with no apologies from anyone.  Bad experience and bad service."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. This was our third time there and probably our last. While they give you great burger add on options it just wasn't that good. Saw the spicy Chipotle bun and thought great. It was stale. They must have microwaved it to soften it but as usual, that cause the edges to be hard. Not a real Chipotle taste either. Burger was average. The fries are good - olive oil and seasonings. Tried the Brunswick fries too since I love Brunswick stew. Meh. To barbecue saucy. Daughters burger was overcooked. Just not that great."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger and I was thrilled when its fifth location opened in the Fiesta Rancho. The burgers are like how my grandmother used to make them, the shakes are so rich and creamy and I love the fried pickles. The ONLY problem is the lack of seating and space. As I was ordering, I was concerned if I would get a table (I did) but I can see that could be a problem, especially with big groups. But the food is wonderful, decadent, comfort food (yes, they offer healthy salads for the person with will power and discipline) and with the ice rink available, you can always get it to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite burger place. The garlic, olive oil and rosemary fries are an absolute must!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love these burgers, I think it's the bun that really does it for me (egg bun), the fries are a bit skinny for my preference but they're still good."}
{"text":"The burgers from here were no higher than average.  The burger came luke-warm (only a little warmer than room temp) with the fries oily and greasy.  The burgers were overly doused in mayonnaise and truffle oils.  The fries were salty and greasy.  In my opinion, it was not worth the high price tag."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and pass right on by this smashburger location. This location is close to my home so it's convenient. However we have many problems the last 3 times we have visited. Poor service, poor food quality, dirty restaurant, just over all bad. I complained multiple times to the district manager and nothing has changed. If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"SinCity smashChicken is my GO TO when I order... The haystack onions and fried egg make it awesome! #smashburgerLV"}
{"text":"A lot of people rave about this place but I consider it just another burger place. 

The two times I have been there including just the other day, the burgers are average and the service is slightly above-average but they seem pretty price ($18 for 3 hamburgers) for that . 

They do have sweet potato fries which is awesome but other than that I just consider them to be in average burger place."}
{"text":"Very odd customer service at this location.  Kitchen staff on point and fast.  Stayed at Rio a few days and this is a great location for a Smashburger that should be operating better.  I'm a Smash regular at various locations and I have no idea what's going on with this place.  At no point would they open up more than one register to take orders.  Tonight we tried again (Friday night at 7:30). 20+ people in line to order.   One person at the register.  We bailed on the line when we realized it was almost hopeless to wait through it all.  We went to the outskirts of the restaurant regroup and noticed what appeared to be a manager just standing at the back watching from a distance, and then retreating further away and not diving in to help, manage, guide, or anything.  Then he continued to look at his phone and turn his back on all of it while overlooking the casino floor down below.  Not sure why they have 4 registers if they are only going to operate one.   The food is fine at this location once you can actually place and order and get it in hand."}
{"text":"I stopped by on my way home tonight to give Smashburger a try.  I opted for the 1/3lb Arizona smashburger (hooray for spicy!) and an order of sweet potato fries, and the bill came out to almost $9.  This was certainly more than I would normally pay for a burger and fries (and no drink), but I was curious to try a smashburger, and I had known going in that it would be more expensive than the average fast food fare.

After I ordered, the girl at the counter said that it would be ready in about 8 minutes.  I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, and when I came out, my food was packed up and ready to go.  Sweet!  They must have used the super heavy duty deluxe edition smasher for my burger, because it took about 30 seconds for the order to be completed.  One thing I did like about the to-go box is that it is waxed on the inside, so the oil isn't seeping out and soaking the cardboard.  I hate going to In n Out etc., getting an order bagged up, and by the time I get home, the bottom is just grease.

Moving onto the food...the burger was actually pretty good.  It had the perfect kick to it with the habanero cheese, chipotle mayo, and fresh jalapenos.  It was a little messy, but I guess when you pile on all that stuff, plus onions, lettuce, a tomato ring and guacamole, it's hard not to make a mess.  Reminds me of the Carl's Jr.'s \"If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face\" campaign!  Oh, the good old days.

The sweet potato fries were just okay in my book.  Maybe it was just my batch, but the kitchen seemed to go a little too trigger happy with the salt.  The order was pretty small also (think somewhere between a Mcdonalds small and a medium order of fries), so I was a little underwhelmed.

All in all, I'd still prefer In n Out for their consistency and price, but I'd hit up Smashburger once in a while just to get something different than a #1 w/grilled onions, fries well-done, and a pink lemonade."}
{"text":"The location is great and the restaurant is clean. I have been here a few times and will return in the future, but overhaul it's not the best service, they always get my name wrong, How is John so difficult? for me the worst thing here is the location of the soda machines, they are located in the main walkway from the kitchen and restrooms, so you have to move several times just getting one drink."}
{"text":"Home of the overpriced burger but we go anyway if that says anything. It's located in the corner of an awesome mini mall with Italian, Chipotle, Greek, sushi and a paradise cafe so there are a ton of options!"}
{"text":"I too came for the sneak peek on Saturday before they opened (being an elite yelper has it's perks!)  I was a bit skeptical at first, we've had a lot of burger joints imported from the west coast that failed miserably.  But Smashburger is different. They have loads of options & you can customize your burger, chicken sandwich or salad.  

The veggie frites are where it's at.  I love veggies & I love fried food so they're a win-win!  I love that you can choose your bun & the egg bun is seriously tasty, I just hope that they import the pretzel bun from their Chicago menu at some point.  You can put any number of toppings on your burgers from avocado to fried eggs.  

The burgers were all surprisingly tasty & flavorful for a fast food joint.  I had the baja burger.  which, be warned,  is actually spicy, the bun even has chipotle peppers in it!  We also tried to Carolina burger, which, despite my hatred of slaw was mighty delicious.  

I want to come back & try the chicken dishes.  We figured since it was a burger place we should try those first.  We split their blt chicken sandwich which was good but the combo of mayo & ranch dressing was pretty messy.  We also sampled the Harvest Salad & it was perfect.  spinach, lettuce, crumbly very mild blue cheese, balsamic dressing & sunflower seeds.  The salad itself was gigantic.  4 of us were eating it & we only made a dent!  Get the small or side salad version unless you plan on sharing!

The only thing our table unanimously agreed missed the mark were the brunswick fries. the sauce just wasn't authentic & they were really heavy.  The sweet potato fries were a bit heavy on the rosemary, but they were still good."}
{"text":"Lunch with my son today.  Got a BOGO coupon and decided to check out the food.  I got myself the mushroom truffle grilled chicken sandwich with light mayo and the season taters.  Not happy with the taters, too greasy.  I was kindly given a refund."}
{"text":"Speaking as a vegetarian their black bean burger is AWESOME! I also like the sweet potato fries and Oreo milk shakes."}
{"text":"Delicious! My man got the Sin City Burger and I got the Jalapeño Baja burger. Fresh. Hot. Quick. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, the smashfries are yummy (on regular potatoes).  My only criticism is it was pretty salty (my grilled chicken and especially my husband's burger) so if you're sensitive to salt I would let them know beforehand, otherwise it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Yeah the food is good, but never have I encountered such terrible service.  My mother and I placed a call to Smashburger when we were quite a distance away so we could arrive just as the food was ready to pick up, and were placed on hold... For 13 minutes straight.  

When we arrived, we were still on hold, and there was exactly one three-person family seated while another two person family placed an order...I'm the entire restaurant while four employees stood around sipping sodas, chatting.  Not one of them could've been bothered to pick up the phone?  When we pulled up the phone to show them, the response from the girl who put us on hold said \"My bad.\"  My mother asked to speak to the manager, who pulled out the phone and hung up.  There was no apology, no one offered a discount, or event a free side of fries despite them giving out those coupons like they're candy most of the time.

Having worked at a restaurant before, and several other customer service jobs, I normally have ridiculous amounts of patience towards employees if I can see they're struggling or genuinely apologetic.  Heck, I've been known to defend waiters and customer service employees to my parents (who have zero patience whatsoever), so you can imagine the level of disregard these people must have had for me to bother posting a negative review of this magnitude. FOUR PEOPLE standing around doing nothing.  I am not exaggerating.  They were leaning on the other side of the counter, sipping sodas, laughing.  I understand that camaraderie is important for one to enjoy their job, so that's not the issue, just a modicum of respect for the job you're meant to hold.  Also, we ordered sodas and were given cups only to discover, after paying, that the machine was broken.  We were not even offered a bottle of soda that I know Smashburger carries as a replacement.

My family often loves to visit this establishment, and though I will probably return because I understand this particular set of employees are not there all the time, my parents tend to hold grudges and have stated they will not return, and will in fact go out do their way to go to the Lake Pleasant location instead of returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I've been waiting 30 min to get my food these guys don't know if they are coming  are going. Poorly managed at least for today that is"}
{"text":"The person that busses tables and cleans the dinning room is also the server. Food sat in the window for 5 to 10 minutes. Our food sat for the 10 minutes wile the server was mopping the floor, on the plus side she did wash her hands after mopping. The kitchen keep making food and stacking baskets in the window, even though they were not being delivered to the customers. The server seemed confused, looking at the computer and then trying to find the right basket to deliver. The kitchen help would place new baskets in the window without regard to order, pushing baskets to one side or the other, separating orders and adding to the confusion of the server. 
 
 The burgers were good, the fires were cold and I would say stale tasting maybe from setting under heat lamps for 10 minutes.


Understaffed and poorly managed, we will not eat at this location again."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger spot!  Food and service is great! Prices are decent and affordable for the quality.

I love the customer service here! They don't hesitate with your order and are very precise! They make sure you are satisfied.

I came here after having horrible service at Fatburger down the street (i.e. Fatburger review). I needed something quick and easy because I was tired and hangry. Guy at Smashburger register took my order. He was having some computer issue and had to reinput my order. By the time he situated my transaction, about 5 mins on cash register, my burger and fries were out! He even upgraded my fries for the hassle. I thought what hassle? I only had to wait a minute for my shake. I love how they're always so quick here. I've been to this location a handful of times and haven't had any complaints with my order or service. 

Compared to the service I just had at my first visit Fatburger to the service I always have here I'm never going anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I hesitated between 3 & 4 stars. My DH enjoyed it more than I did. I found the burger flavorful but a little too salty for me Liked the bun and the smash sauce.. Not a fan of the fried pickles. They were just too salty. The shakes were great. The service was great. Very clean."}
{"text":"This is my second time to smash burger ever. I used the app to order because my husband was getting cafe rio next door and it was just easier. The first time I went, they messed up my order. It's frustrating that it's written out, word for word, and they still messed it up. Last time they gave me regular fries and when I mentioned that, the staff member didn't seem to care. I got the smash fries this time and they tasted almost the same as their regular fries. Very disappointing. 
This time when I let them know that they were out of Dr Pepper, again, they didn't seem to care. 
The food at Smashburger isn't half as good as in n out, and it cost nearly double. 
Very disappointed with the lack of customer service. That part alone will make me not want to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty solid burger. Fries look dinky but are crispy and flavorful. Free refills. And \"normal\" fast food prices. All that considering I'm in an airport and that equals 5-stars."}
{"text":"This was our first time at a Smashburger so we are not certain if all locations operate the same way, but this was not a good experience. First, the cashier/order taker was very helpful navigating the menu and was efficient.  Next, when the food finally appeared, it was good.  The problem is staffing and cleanliness.  No one removed order numbers, cleaned the tables or bothered to empty the clearly overflowing garbage can or removes used glasses and dishes.  We were there about 45 - 60 minutes and never saw anyone take action.   Lastly, it appears Smashburger is under-staffing and we won't likely return as organization and cleanliness are key to us."}
{"text":"If you like spicy then try the Arizona burger. They definitely know how to make a burger and it was worth the price. I just wish that the fries came with it but here everything is alacarte. Oh well. The fries where crispy like chips which I enjoyed very much and before I forget,  they cook your burger fresh to order. Nice."}
{"text":"Food is great but service sucks. I have issues every time I go! That is why I will not go to this location again! If you're near the Lake Mead/Buffalo location save some money and visit In n Out down the road instead!"}
{"text":"First time here this evening and we got treated like SHIT!!!!  I ordered the Avocado club with gluten free bread and after we ordered they tell me they don't have any and if I wanted the to eat my sandwich without a bun!!!! How the FUCK IS IT A SANDWICH IF you don't have the FUCKING BUN!!!!!! We also got 
An order of fries which taste like the Oil was used over & over again they were so nasty!!! Then after our food was ready the girl was already cleaning and she stops to walk over to get our food & as she heading to get the food she is scratching her head!!!!  Yes scratching her HEAD!!!! I knew I wasn't going to eat it anyways & I was going to return it for that reason as well!!!! I asked her for a wheat bun & I asked the girl if I can please get a side fries for the inconvenience and she said NO!!! I said take your food back we don't want it and they were telling us that they were closing in 3 minutes instead of worrying about making it right for the customer!!!! First and last time I go there!!! The manager didn't do anything to compensate us all they were worried was that they were closing in 3minutes!!!! I told the manager we didn't want the food we want all our money and all she said was \"WOW\"!!!  POOR SERVICE AND MANAGEMENT!!! She needs to go back to management 101 she obviously doesn't care about the customers it's only a JOB for her!!!! How miserable she looked too!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent & food was FANTASTIC!  Gotta luv those pickles"}
{"text":"I was reading some of the other reviews before writing this, and I honestly wonder if I go to the same Smashburger that everyone else seems to go to... Every time I've gone, whether it's been busy or slow, the staff has always been phenomenal. I usually go on my lunch break, so it just depends on the day if I get caught in the lunch rush. They're very friendly and always apologize for any wait that seems too long. The GM of this store is extremely hospitable as well. He helped me today, and I felt like I was talking to a friend. The burgers are very savory and the smash fries are among the best fries in the fast food industry. I would also recommend the sweet potato fries... I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes at all, but those fries have got it goin' on!! This is definitely my go-to place for burgers."}
{"text":"So this place as a few things going for it. One the Burgers are solid, way better than a Fast Food burger but of course not like the homemade ones at home. Second Smash Fries are great I recommend splitting with someone if each are getting a burger. Lastly but most important they sell beer here, which if you get a bucket of four beers, it is only $8 you can do the math and realize best price in town especially with their choices of Micro brews. So if your going to see a movie and want to get a couple of beers and some food, solid place to go."}
{"text":"This was my first visit since they've opened and reopened.  I decided to try the BBQ, Bacon and Cheddar Smashburger with small fries. The staff was outstanding, extremely helpful and friendly. The seating and drinks are self service, but unlike 5 Guys, the staff brings your food and clears your table. The smashburger was great, perfectly grilled; however, I thought they forgot to add the BBQ sauce, but I found a little bit hiding under the cheddar cheese. They were too conservative on the BBQ sauce and we both ended up having to add some Heinz ketchup.  The buns were soft but slightly on the thicker side...yeah, I'm still talking about the sandwich. Lol!  Anyway, the fries were outstanding, hot and seasoned well. While they're thinner than Mcdonald's french fries, they were much fresher and their portion made up for their lack in size.  Their prices were moderate and slightly lower than Red Robin and 5 Guys, but seemed right given the portion and serving size. I'd recommend giving this place a try for lunch and I plan to return again to try some of their other varietal options, including the smashed chicken sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Burger is okay, but the service and attitude of the employees is horrible. Third time in in 2 months ( I live close)"}
{"text":"Better than average food but I'm telling you the parking situation both here and at the baseline road store is horrible.

Update:  Smashburger must have a very unique & innovative training program for their shift leaders/managers.  As I walk towards the cash register a few nights ago the guy who looked like he was either the shift leader or the manager says to me how's it going \"boss\".  And when I did not respond to that because I think that is a very disrespectful way to greet a customer he says what can I get for you \"boss\".

This is a place of business...not some gathering of the boys in the hood"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, the burger was great. I tried it again after a year and found the food so greasy. We did not enjoy it at all."}
{"text":"My sister was the one who initially told me about Smashburger. We decided to try it, and I have to say it was quite delicious. This location was clean and the staff is very friendly. Large menu on the wall, on the wall by the door and by the cash wrap.

I ordered myself the Sin City burger, the local burger, and was quite excited to have a fried egg on a burger. Not sure why I was so excited when the Counter in CA also provides this custom item on their burgers. Very well cooked, and all the ingredients went well together. Onion strings, bacon, and a fried egg, really good. Also, I got one order of the smash fries and they were great. It wasn't super oily and it was well seasoned. Sadly I did not get one of their milkshakes, I will on my next visit.

I will return."}
{"text":"I visited Smashburger on Rea Road because I had heard it advertised on the local sports station.  I placed a simple order and received it in reasonable time.  For the $11 I paid it was definitely a disappointment.  The burger was mediocre and the fries were cold.  There are other burger places in Charlotte I would rather visit.  I figured I would try their Haagen Daas milkshake and, again, for the price, I was a little disappointed.  Not sure I'm going to return."}
{"text":"I've always liked smashburger. Great burgers and fries. Quality food compared to most burger places. It's been a few years since I've had it but tonight's food was seriously lacking. Grease grease grease. Why is my burger SOAKED with it? Very disappointing. 

I will be back to smashburger but not this location.  I don't want to deal with the grease and the teenage workers who seem annoyed you're there."}
{"text":"This smashburger location I find myself visiting time and time again. The food is great and the service is outstanding! I Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Meh. I find it hard to like a place that charges upward of $9 for a burger but doesen't include fries. On the upside the chocolate shake is great!.  The burger was better than good but less than great."}
{"text":"I have probably been to SmashBurger on a biweekly basis since discovering it.  Can't say enough about how delicious all their options are.  My favorite is the Arizona Burger, by far.  And I love, love, love the Smash sauce.  Sweet potato fries and fried pickles are also pretty tasty.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came in to redeem a bogo coupon that I often get from their rewards program. Needed food to go. I ordered a classic turkey no cheese no mayo. I got my bf the mushroom swiss. Food didn't take long to receive. Dining area was clean and it was quiet for a Sunday evening. When I recieved my order, it was a pleasant surprise to see the burgers bagged separately. I thanked her for that because my bf was taking his to work. My turkey burger was very good. 1st time getting it and it won't be the last."}
{"text":"So my boy friend and I have avoided this place for really no reason at all. We always just chose In-N-Out burger instead. Last night we were so indecisive so we decided now is our chance to try something new. Being that I am a burger and fries type of gal I was for it. We walked in and to the register. The manager was working the register and asked us what we would like to order as we were looking at the menu. We told him that we are unsure because it was our first time there. So my boyfriend asked him what is favorite was and he said you can choose from all of these burgers. Just choose what you think you'd like. Granite I get that it is not the easiest situation to be in when someone asked you what would you choose but we didn't we simply asked him what is favorite was or what he would suggest. But nope. He could have gave us some sort of an opinion just to let us feel a little more comfortable with ordering. But nope. So I always go with the basic bacon cheese burger. So that's what I ordered with a couple of modifications. The he says this sounds more like a build your own. We'll make it a build your own instead. So I'm like really we had no clue we could even \"build our own\". Then my boy friend orders the burger topped with the bacon and egg and we ordered a basket of large fries. The manager told us to have a seat and they would bring us our food. I liked that. Our food was out in a very timely manner. It was awesome and everything still taste fresh! Like it was never frozen. The quality of the meat was phenomenal. You can just tell it was never frozen or pre made patties. The food I must say was beyond great. Taste home made. One of the best burgers I have had in a long time! I was going to rate this place 4 stars because I didn't like the service from the \"manager\" but we conversed with a cook that was working in the from for the day. She told us about the salted caramel shake. We ordered that as well and loved it. Although alps I could do was taste it because I was by far way too full from the burger and fries. She conversed with us for about 30 mins. Talking about the restaurant and how she loved being in the restaurant business. Even a little of our personal lives lol. She made the service great! And I forgot about the crappy device from the manager. Awesome job !"}
{"text":"A decent chicken sandwich. Still miss Flo's Chinese here at sky Harbor though. Bla bla bla more text required."}
{"text":"Had a great experience, Sabastion was super friendly and helped us big time with the menu. Will defiantly recommend and I will be back for some more grub."}
{"text":"My food was brought to me COLD. I don't really think I need to say much more. If you want a good burger, go to Habit, Burger Fi, or Rehab Burger. Stay far, far away from this horrendous place."}
{"text":"Late review.
Decided to try this spot while in Vegas since another spot was closed on 4th of July.
Used the Yelp coupon for checking in.
My daughter LOVED the grilled cheese meal.  She's a picky eater when it comes to her sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger!!! Everytime we go the burgers a fresh, juicy, and hot... I am totally in love with their onion strings and my husband just loves the deep fried pickles with mustard.. My daughters favorite was the smashfries with rosemary and garlic... This place is definitely a must stop for any burger lover.."}
{"text":"Great burgers, if you are not on a health kick or concerned with calories then try it. I admit, I feel a little guilty when I come here because I know I've likely consumed a day's worth of calories. But, it really is so darn good. Their burgers are so flavorful, fried pickles are very delish! They also sometimes have these nutter butter shakes, But I think it's limited time only, and that was to die for!"}
{"text":"My kids spent 4 hours in urgent care on IV's Saturday March 4th.  Both had food borne illness from eating burgers at this place.  If you ate here Friday and think you got the stomach flu guess again.  Usually eat here when visiting Phoenix but no thanks from now on."}
{"text":"I usually stay away from chain restaurants because I hate corporate type deuce bags that but cheap ingredients and charge a premium. I am rating the employees here 5 STARS. 

The employees here are always in a good mood and super friendly. They we so nice to us and it was warm, clean and comfortable inside. I can tell the people working here are happier then most places in town. The food is great and I'm happy to pay a little extra for a well rounded eating experience. 

Smash Corp- make sure treat your employees well and your employees will treat us well. The day you sell out like all the others I will stop coming."}
{"text":"Smashburger is a joke.  There is no consistency in their product.  One day you get a nicely cooked burger the next it is over cooked, dry, and tasteless or, the worst, undercooked and raw in the middle.   The location at West Sahara is the worst when it comes to inconsistencies.  Don't try to order a burger and ask them to hold something off of it, they will make you do a build your own because they are too lazy to have to punch a couple extra keys on the register.  Do yourself a favor and skip smashburger, more hype than hope of a good meal."}
{"text":"Sunday I went to smash burger on eastern. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. I ordered the jalapeño burger. It was a good amount of spicy that wasn't too overwhelming. The burger wasn't greasy  and very fresh. I would recommend ordering the sweet potato fries as well. The restaurant was busy and it took a while to order but the service was good overall. If you haven't tried this place yet I suggest you do so soon."}
{"text":"I have recently abandoned Five Guys and adopted Smashburger as a 'go-to burger place'. I really enjoy it! For starters their prices are quite reasonable (especially compared to the likes of Five Guys). I also love how they give customers the opportunity to get free smashfries by completing a survey! 

Smashburger in general just seems to care about their customers and their employees will often introduce themselves by name when bringing you your order. The food is quite good, especially the burger. The fries aren't the greatest I have ever had, but they certainly are unique! The restaurant interior is also pretty sweet compared to burger places like this."}
{"text":"Good quality burgers and yummy chili fries.

With all the options for a semi-fast food burger in town, SmashBurger is among the top."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger, I have gone to probably 8 different locations in Arizona and California.  Because this one is new I figure they are still working out the problems assoicated with opening a new restraunt.  The food quality is okay not as good as other locations I have been to.  I believe part of this is the staff is not up to speed and can not handle the rush of people.  I will continue to go there, but if the quality and service does not increase over time I will start driving back to the glendale location.  I love you smashburger lets get it together."}
{"text":"We finally went to Smashburger after our daughter told us how fantastic it was.  I wasn't convinced it was my kind of place.  But shame on me.  I love the fact you can pick your burger size.  And the rosemary and sea salt fries are beyond good.  Beer is cold.  Food is awesome.  Service is enthusiastic and friendly.  My kind of place after all."}
{"text":"You know what happens?  After a while, I forget how bad this place is and give it another chance.  I don't see what all the hype is about.  The burger is nothing special.  Also, the place smells disgusting.  Must be a problem with their drainage or something.  Overpriced for what you get.  I will always choose to drive to In N Out and pay less for a much better burger."}
{"text":"smashburger...I heart you.  Yummy burger, great topping choices, great priced and tasty sides.  I dream about those onion strings.  You have it all.  And...a clean tidy environment where civilized people bring you food on a tray not a greasy bag.  You changed my mind about other places I reviewed!  

Just opened a second location the NW and I plan to go every chance I get."}
{"text":"Some of the best juciest burgers around. I usually get the  AZ burger or AZ chicken grilled which packs a punch with fresh slices of jalapeno. I have to say the guac isn't the best but it does it's job with so much going on. The hubs is all over the create his own which almost always has a fried egg on it (if you haven't tried it this way you should). The kiddo loves the BBQ Bacon & Cheddar & at 13 with a real metabolism I say go kid go!Then the sides.... oh the sides! Deep fried pickle slices are my personal fave. A close second is the Smash Fries which are seasoned with rosemary, olive oil & garlic. Mmm mmm good! Then last but not least are the sweet potato smash fries also seasoned with rosemary, olive oil & garlic too. Enjoy by all means enjoy God & my skinny jeans know I do."}
{"text":"This place is Yum! The food is good and you can customize. They have more options than your regular burger joint. The people and customer service are great!"}
{"text":"If you dont feel like waiting at a fancy restaurant for a decent custom made burger, hate big crowds at pubs and diners then this is the place for you. Who the hell orders a burger anyway where you gotta use a knife and fork? Dont be a troll. Its pretty good."}
{"text":"So glad they are bringing theses to AZ, because they are great."}
{"text":"Make sure you check your pick up order, or just your order in general when coming to this place. The one I went to in Tempe brought my food out COLD. This location butchered a simple order with NO modifications whatsoever. I was also the only person in the restaurant at that time, so there was no excuse. I ordered an a Avocado Ranch Black Bean Burger and there was NO avocado, no cheese, no ranch, and a piece of wilted lettuce. Needless to say, this place is garbage and it shows how much they care (which is little to none) . I don't eat fast food, so I have higher expectations for these fast casual burger places. It's pretty sad when a place like Burger King or Wendy's can make a better burger and not screw up as much as these guys do. If you are looking for a good burger, go to Habit, Burger Fi, or Rehab Burger in Old Town. Stay FAR, FAR AWAY from this place."}
{"text":"Good location, good clean service. I had the Classic Smash in Reg.size for $4.99. You can get the BIG size for $5.99 which is a much better deal since in my opinion, the Reg size it's a bit small (for a guy eating it, for a girl it should be perfect). The burger is among the best I've had. Big, juicy, full flavored patty resembling a home-made burger. I had it with the sweet onion fries, which were good, but the sweet flavor does not go well with the burger. Go for regular fries instead. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A shout out to all the workers tonight at smashburger!  My 2.5 year old son has severe food allergies and rarely eats outside our home.  The chefs- manager and all the workers made sure that he was able to have something different and delicious.  They went above and beyond and we all are very appreciative of the effort they took to ensure he was safe .. Thank you !
Sincerely --
Ronnie and family"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Smash Burger, and I have to say I'm very impressed. The burger (Sin City Burger) was amazing! The service was fast and friendly, and the place was clean and organized. They even sell beer, so you can have a cold one with your burger! Great place."}
{"text":"Solid fast casual food.  The chicken sandwiches and burgers are always moist and flavorful (as they should be with all their calorie bomb glory).  The rosemary/garlic/herb fries are addictive (you really cannot have just one).  Their shakes are probably some of the better ones I've had; not hand-scooped diner or fancy burger place level but definitely above McDonald's and company.

The wait is not bad at all, they have fantastic parking in their strip mall, and it's been clean with friendly service every time I've gone.  It's not really a destination for me, but it's definitely a safe choice for a good quick bite."}
{"text":"good food, but pricey because sides are not included. Great atmosphere. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This is my wife's and my second visit.  The Smashfries are pretty darn good as well as the burgers. I was very pleased with those. The Haystack Onions are awesome! However, the Buffalo Fries were way way way too salty and the salad was too sour from too much vinagarett dressing.  We still have some things to try and like the place enough to come back and try them.  Overall, I recommend the place.  Expect to pay $10 per person for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Will never come back and it was my 1st time. Super unfriendly cashier had us waiting 10min just cuz she was talking with friends. Then they didn't want to take my coupons since it didnt have a bar code. So when I asked for corporate number I got it along with a note that said \"lick my ass\".... Sad part is I was only asking for the number so I can see if they would send me coupons with a barcode so I can go back. This happen today around 8:10pm. At the RIO mamger didn't give me her name so I cant tell you who she was."}
{"text":"Went back to give them a 2nd chance. Ordered a chicken sandwich this time. Got a piece of leather covered in some sauce. Couldn't eat it. Actually inedible. Took my family of four. Spent almost $60. On \"fast food.\" At a burger place. And we're not piggies. Got regular meals. I think one of us got a shake. It's just so expensive. Esp for food you don't want to eat. And it's SUCH a disappointment. Waited soooo long for this place to open. And...um...no. Customer service is spot on. But for $10-$12 burgers/sandwiches you can't eat?? Boo. No thank you."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I really enjoyed the Cobb salad and my sister had the bacon, cheddar BBQ burger and the sweet potato fries. She really liked it as well. The only reason this didn't get five stars is the cashier was rude. She seemed uninterested and acted like taking our order was an inconvenience. Everyone else was very nice and the food, as I said, was good enough to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Great quality food!! Its so fresh you really cant eat it to go. The shakes are great! and the smash fries but a nice twist from the average basket of fries you get at most places! Even the chicken is really good!!"}
{"text":"It's really tough to say SmashBurger has the \"best burgers\" in town, as I think The Palm (Caesar's) does, though that is really subjective...but it's easy to say it has great burgers, great sides, fine service and a pleasant atmosphere. I've been there at least a half dozen times. The Classic is my favorite, though I've tried others; and the Smash Fries are just grand.

For a quick lunch or dinner, at very reasonable prices, in Summerlin, give it a try -- My guess is you'll like it. 

For the record, the \"Good for kids?\" survey question is one to which I'll always respond \"No,\" as I'm so tired of having them run about and yell where I go -- Take 'em to Chucky Cheese."}
{"text":"100% grease burger totally disgusting 
I needed the restroom immediately afterwards 
Stick with old reliable Burger King or subway"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, smash fries are great! Staff at this location are friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"I was able to go try SmashBurger for the first time the other night at the Sin City Burger VIP Party. I have to say, it was pretty darn good. 

Staff was super friendly and helpful in letting us know what they're favorites were. The location is clean and very contemporary, but it still had a 50's burger joint feel. I liked it.

My husband and I both ordered the Sin City burger, since it was the guest of honor. I got the 1/3 lb (there was a 1/2 lb available too) and it was stacked with sauteed onions, thick cut apple wood bacon, a fried egg and then their shoestring onion rings on top of a golden kaiser roll. Holy crap, the 1/3 was huge! I couldn't imagine the 1/2 pounder. I could only eat half (which of course made my husband happy). Anyway...it was good! I was curious about the fried egg aspect, but it was like breakfast on a burger. Burgers good. Breakfast good. My only thing was it was a tad salty for my taste, but luckily for me they had Four Peaks Kilt Lifter available with a frosted cold mug. :) :) :)

We also ordered the rosemary fries and the shoestring onion rings on the side. I was a fan of the fries...I loves me some rosemary. They were cooked to crispy yet mealy perfection. The onion rings were okay. I liked them better on top of the burger as opposed to the side. Would like to try their sweet potato fries next time.

We were also given the Cactus Vanilla milk shake to try. Again very good, I had no complaints, I just wasn't sure I tasted the cactus. I could have and not known it, but it tasted like a regular vanilla milk shake to me. Next time the hubby and I decided will order a vanilla milkshake and a cactus vanilla and compare. Can't go wrong with two milk shakes too.

Did I mention they had frosted cold mugs for the beer?

So yup, we will go back! Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Meh...keep coming back because the kids like this place, but the fries are always stale and cold, the burgers are boring and too salty for my taste. Smash burger means just that....smash the burger and all the juice is gone, and I'd rather have a juicy and tasty burger...may be good for some, but not for me.

By the way, their haystack onions are delish and the employees are very nice :)

I would prefer to spend my money at Five Guys though."}
{"text":"This place has the best milkshakes in town!!! Their burgers are also way better than comparable priced joints. Me and my girlfriend come here all the time and get points to use on our future purchases for great discounts. The workers are very friendly too you won't regret coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Eh, this place is alright. Fast and friendly service. Wish my egg was sunny side up. Fries were good."}
{"text":"Salty burger pattie instantly ruined my meal. They do not have a fresh made taste either. The fries and shakes are good though."}
{"text":"Ordered a kids smash burger, a BBQ bacon cheese burger and onion straws.
The kids burger was decent, it came with a drink and fries. 

I really wanted to try their smashed fries, but they were out. How can you run out of fries at a burger place??? So I ordered onion straws instead, it was surprisingly good. Just wished the portion was a bit bigger. 

The bbq bacon cheese burger came up to $7 without any sides or drinks, it tasted better than McDonald's burger but not better than five guys. Though it's more expensive than Five Guys and had smaller portion. Smashburger is definitely on the pricey end. Will be back later to try the smashed fries, I hope that they will have it in stock next time."}
{"text":"This Smashburger is right up the street from me so I go here often when I can't think of anything to have for dinner... or have a craving for their Arizona burger, which is amazing, with the jalapeños and guac.  

It wasn't much of a wait today but I've been there before where there is a good long line. The wait staff is always very friendly and helpful. My order came out within 5 minutes. I usually get the sweet potato fries but I opted for the regular fries this time, next time I'll stick with the sweet potato.

Because everything is ordered separately it's a little pricier than some burger joints. I paid $9 for hamburger and french fries, but it's worth it because everything is fresh & they're always juicy."}
{"text":"First time. Probably missed something here... food was served hot, fairly quickly, staff is nice and place is clean. Overall food while better than McDs is not serving up a wow factor for me. Two meals with a free buger coupon, soft drinks....$17. Glad I had the coupon. Full price of $25 wasn't justified. Get a coupon! Good but you should be able to do better for the same or slightly more elsewhere. Will come back and try another angle on the food. But again; with a coupon!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in the manager of this Resturant.  We ordered online at 720 for a 745 pick up. It's 805 and she pretty much ignored me when I commented on the time they were supposed to deliver. I was in the same Resturant on Sunday and her 18 year old assistant manager performs customer service 10 times this manager."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I. just had dinner there tonight and it was not bad at all. There fries were realy good and the Hamburg buns were great."}
{"text":"To begin, all of the staff members were energetic, bright, and funny. I went around noon and the place was relatively busy. Robin, the cashier, was extremely kind, knowledgeable and personable. I always appreciate it when I go to purchase anything and the person I'm talking to is very open and enthusiastic. Although it was busy, I didn't wait more that 4 minutes for my food. Great service, great experience, great staff. Keep it up guys :)"}
{"text":"The food here is good.  They offer gluten free food here as well.  My favorite is the chicken avocado Club, and I get some sweet potato fries on the side.   They have great organic iced teas here as well."}
{"text":"I visit different smash burger restaurants in the city, but this one seems mismanaged.  The person that was in \"charge\" stayed in the kitchen, and left the nice lady Tori out front to take orders and deliver food, and it was obviously too busy for that.  She came out briefly just to talk to some friends.  Everything took too long, and the restaurant was pretty messy.  It didn't seem to be getting any better throughout my time eating there.  Nice cashier, but I'll probably pass on this place for a while for normal meal times, and check back here to see if they manage it any better.  The food was still good...when I got it."}
{"text":"This is a well managed smash burger.  The employees are friendly and competent during my visits.  The food is pretty quick, and it tastes good.  If you check in here (as of Oct 2014) you get 10% off your order here, which is pretty cool.  Love the iced green tea, although it can be a bit too sweet at times.  My regular is avocado Club grilled chicken, with sweet potatoe fries.  Pretty clean, and tastes good.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Every smash burger I've been to, I've liked. They run a good shop here! I like their drink selection..food is consistently good and they get your order out fast. As an added little detail, they have cut straws in half so the little ones have one. Great job, guys! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely at the top of my list for burger joints!! The smash burgers are outstanding, the smash fries are delicious and the Nutter Butter shakes are the perfect dessert to top it all off! The staff is friendly and patient. Most the time I go there the place is busy so seating can be difficult for bigger groups, but well worth any trouble."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here!  I took a chance and the burgers were alot better than I expected.  Shake Shack is still my favorite, but this is a close second!"}
{"text":"First time but not my last. Food was great and the service was ok or as expected for an airport location. Food was hot and fresh. Average wait time for cooked to order.  I plan on visiting other locations."}
{"text":"I'd not spent much time at SmashBurger before purchasing the Holiday SmashPass--a $54 expenditure giving me the privilege of purchasing one SmashBurger entree a day for 54 days. I've used that SmashPass religiously and am so grateful I purchased it.

Their food is great! The flavors are contemporary, ingredients are fresh, and portions are bountiful. Additionally, the restaurant and bathrooms are  always impeccably clean.

The best thing about this SmashBurger, though, is the employees. When I walk in, Steven smiles and makes me feel truly appreciated. On one occasion, I was on the phone outside when my order was ready. Brad stopped what he was doing and brought my meal to the curb for me. Kayla is the consummate professional. Everyone there smiles and seems to enjoy their work and customers."}
{"text":"This SmashBurger is very clean with good service and tasty food, just like all other SmashBurgers I've visited.

{"text":"Not sure whats happened to the place, but its really gone downhill.  Staff is ill prepqred and on the brude side, asked to speak with a manager and was told he was busy in his office...really?  Its been over 20 minutes and still no sign of him.  Tables arent bussed, had to ask to get a clean table so we could eat.  Not able to rate the food, i was too frustrated to enjoy it.  Asked for water cups, only one was clean so they gave us a childs paper cup.  Brought out part of our order, didnt know where the rest of it was and it took 3 tries to get a side of chipotle mayo right.  Sorry, will be contacting corporate on this one.  Now 30 minutes and still no manager...checked the front and here is no line either.  Ordered a shake, got it in a paper cup, not the steel cup that gives a little extra...as the customer next to us received his...in a timely manner.  Did I mention my wife had go get her shake...took over 20 minutes for that taken care of.  Up to 35 minutes and still no manager....wow!

UPDATE: We did finally get to speak to a manager, I believe his name was Chris.  Came to find out one of the cooks quit that day, and he had been in the kitchen preparing our meal.  Have to give him a little slack and will update by 1 star.  He was great, firendly, professional, an asset to the company.  Also heard back from Corporate, and they really seem to care about their service.  Will give it another try based on these experiences."}
{"text":"Burger had a good home grilled taste, kids hot dog was good tasted like a Costco hot dog, smash fries had zero garlic taste, and the Az Cobb was very fresh but not exceptional. Overall good food but not worth the money. Did NOT have any ice cream but that did look good."}
{"text":"Didn't know there was a Smashburger in Charlotte. Happened to see a banner near Stonecrest shopping center. Its located beside Dean & Deluca and Qdoba. I had the Mushroom & Swiss Burger with a side of Smashfries. Split an Oreo milkshake with my son. Burger was excellent. The seasoned fries are a nice touch. Friendly & attentive staff for a 'fast-food' casual type of place. Good price point for the type of cuisine.
Like the Cherry Coke and Mello Yellow selections at the soda fountain."}
{"text":"Love Smashburger but don't go to this location especially for take out! First online order, arrived to pick up, dozens of employees working, no line and no acknowledgment that order was ready....food was cold. Second attempt for pick up a few weeks later waited in line to pay, was called over to pick up food, handed over my credit card and was told I would have to get back in line to pay after already waiting 10 minutes in the line I was called out of!. Ummm no! Manager is to busy watching the order screen then to watch the customer service. All in all don't order for pick up and go to a different location!"}
{"text":"LOVE it! They have some unique options instead of the usual fries/onion rings and they are delicious! 

We LOVE any of their chicken sandwiches, the burgers and the sweet potato fries are  our favorite! 

Try it!"}
{"text":"Been here before but I had the BBQ cheddar burger with smash fries.  The fries are unbelievable and can't be missed.  The burgers are great and the service is always great!!!!!"}
{"text":"My 2 teenagers rated this 2 stars.  They're value conscious and said price too high for what you get.  We went for convenience since we were in the area and they were too hungry too leave and look for alternatives.  Soft drinks were $4.49 which is the highest by far we've seen on the strip. If you're staying at Caesars, you save $1 with a Players card, so it's not so bad for guests.

They preferred Shake Shack much more.  The other food court options--pizza, seafood, etc, were not for them.  The sweet potato fries were hot while the skinny fries were not.  

We found the food court at the MGM to be of better value with better options, especially the made to order pizza place."}
{"text":"Had their classic smash burger that they claim to smash the beef on the grill with butter to lock in the juices, etc.   it has a decent bun with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a side of slightly spicy thousand island dressing.   The cheeseburger had a slightly salty taste to it.  The French fries were very good, but the upgraded ones weren't worth the extra cost.   The haystack onions were very tasty too.   You can also order chicken, turkey(?), and black bean for the patties.  They served us very quickly, except we had to wait for one black bean burger and upgraded fries."}
{"text":"I enjoy smash burgers food but, most of the people working are quiet/shy/nervous Highschool kids. Which I think it's great because I think that you should have a your first job when you're in High school, but I wish these kids have a little more confidence and less nervous because it makes me nervous ordering sometimes, I don't want to stress them out I just want to order a burger :)"}
{"text":"After second visit the food has improved a lot. the burgers were really tasty and seasoned good and not too greasy as previously stated. Overall we found the place to be enjoyable to eat at and will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is horrible! This store never gets my order right. I've been here three times for to go orders. Each time they've either forgot an item, added sauce to an item or gave us the wrong item. In my book, third time and you're out! I am never coming back! Never! You've lost a customer because your employees, including the manager, don't pay attention."}
{"text":"This are the most disgusting burgers my husband and I have ever eaten McDonald's is way better than this place, absolutely disgusting too greasy the bread was extremely soggy their fries were cold and hard and their fried pickles were supper salty and soggy. Their customer service was bad"}
{"text":"Honestly I hate to complain but was not happy with this experience at all. My fiancé got a create a burger and the cashier said he couldn't make it a double burger when in fact is advertised that you can on menu and for what we got it wasn't worth the 25$ dollars I will happily spend my money else where and get better burgers and service. It seems like the employees are so unexperienced. Y'all might wanna step it cause your bad reviews definitely out way your good ones."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after hearing how awesome the burgers were. We ordered burgers, fries, onion rings, and a salad!! Very large servings! The burgers were fresh and tasted great! The fries were good and the onion rings were awesome! We also tried a milkshake which was very good! The place was empty except for us which was nice, while we waited for the food a few of the staff kept yelling back and forth to each other from across the restaurant which was ok but a little loud and distracting, Then our food came and we never really saw anyone after that. It's like everyone disappeared after that. We needed some to go containers but never saw anyone to ask, so we helped ourselves to the containers and left. I should mention that the man who helped us at counter did come out and ask how everything was a few minutes after dropping it off. So we weren't alone the whole time! All n all we will be coming back! The food was fresh and good and when we did see the staff they were friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with Anthony M and Jieun L before the CMYE Milkshake Tasting started so we could grab a bite before the place got packed. 

What I ordered:

Mushroom Swiss Burger 
Smash Fries
Root Beer (IBC)

The burger was good. The fries were not seasoned enough and just tasted like regular fries. The root beer was good cause they gave me an ice cold mug to pour it into."}
{"text":"Love this place! Hamburgers are so good and you can have them anyway you want. I've never tried them but my husband really enjoys the haystack onions. They're kind of chintzy with the fries but overall I would definitely recommended and I will be returning."}
{"text":"I am kind-of on a mission to try all the veggie burgers in the city. When I dropped off my sister for her piano lesson, I decided to kill that hour at Smashburger. I ordered the Spicy Black Bean burger with Smash Sweet Potato fries. When I was given an table marker, I expected my food to take a while. I was surprised that it only took around 5-10 minutes to arrive. The burger came with a ball of mashed avocado and four slices of jalapeño, along with tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and a slice of pepper jack cheese. The first thought when I took a bite, was that the patty was quite soft and it was well seasoned, second thought was that they really made sure the salt was in there. The patty was so salty, I downed two glasses of water to finish the burger. The smash sweet potato fries were crispy but left me with an oily mouth. Service was really good, the servers and bus were quick on their feet and cleared tables super fast. I would come back, next time ask for no salt on anything and regular sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already since I moved to this side of town and it's a decent burger place. Customer service is ok, the food is overpriced for the quality but it's tastier than Mcdonalds fake stuff so I'll always be back. Great menu selection, just hope they can hire someone to actually make the food with quality."}
{"text":"Ordered pickup order for an Avocado club burger and there was barely a teaspoon of avocado on the burger.

Seems like cooks were rushing orders because it was 30 minutes before closing... regardless if it's the beginning or end of your shift quality should always be at the same level

I guess I'll drive the 2 extra miles to pick up at the lake mead location instead."}
{"text":"All Smashburgers aren't created equal. They're just not! This one however is one of the best. Definitely better than the Smashburger near me (Camelback and 20th). I came in on a day when everyone seemed to check the mail and received the BOGO (buy on get one), yet the staff had everything under control. There was a rotating door that night for sure. Everyone was so patient. I ordered the Smashburger Classic but with turkey and added yellow mustard. Man, it was everything I needed that evening. Perfectly seasonly, not greasy AT ALL (Again, take note Camelback and 20th St Smashburger)."}
{"text":"I wanna love Smashburger!  I used to love Smashburger years ago.  I want to believe this issue I have is only at this location.  Every single time I come here the burgers are sooooo salty and I really, really wish they would SMASH some of the grease out of the burger before they put in on a bun!  My goodness!"}
{"text":"Quite good actually I was pretty surprised! The cashier who also helped us order was very nice and especially helpful. I ordered the classic, perfect choice for me and I liked that they have 2 sizes to choose from~ my husband ordered something with bacon which he enjoyed very much!
    The olive oil & garlic fries are the MUST HAVE ITEM on the menu~
     Definatly hives Freddie's a run for the $$"}
{"text":"Great burger and the Cobb salad with smashburger on top.  Sooo delicious and it was topped with a fried egg.  Quite large but I was able to handle it all, barely."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger and was so excited to see one opening up in Fort Mill.  We have been to this location twice and my review is based on this location, others I have given higher. 

I'm not sure what it is about this location, but I feel like their quality does not match up with what I have loved about others.  For example, the first time I got the mushroom swiss burger and there were only 2 mushrooms on it.  Other Smashburgers, the entire burger was covered, and then some!  Also, the smash fries, are not very smashed compared to other places.  You tell me where the seasoning is at in my picture at my second visit.  Other Smashburgers, there are globs of the seasoning on the fries!

The flavor of the food, burgers, and shakes are great, and I think this location has potential, but it just needs to get on par with the others."}
{"text":"I still love Smashburger, as we love their burgers - still great flavor!  But recently they have made menu changes and took off some of the items I loved. 

Another big change, they changed their fries.  The smashfries recipe is still the same, but the actual fries have changed, which changes the flavors.  I do not like the new fries.

I don't get why so many companies change what works and what people have come to love.  Maybe because they can get a better price with things, but these changes come at the expense of the customer.

We will now not likely go and will go try other burger places, such a big disappointment Smashburger."}
{"text":"The person who took our order, Mila, was rude and impatient. Both our meals were prepared improperly. When we brought this to their attention they suggested it was not their fault. The manager, Devin, was unprofessional and short with us. He turned 2 people away at 9:20 PM because they were going to close in ten minutes. And then when we were walking out at 9:30 Devin and Mila were smoking a cigarette in the front parking lot with people still in the restaurant. Overall terrible experience from the food to the management. We eat here 1-2 times per week and will now be finding another burger place."}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service!

Calgary burger was delicious but next time I'm asking for heavy on the sauce.

Fries are good but cool off fast.

Haystack onion rings are ridiculous! Paper thin, crispy goodness. I inhaled those like a crispy Kreme donut!

Kids loved their Kid Smash burgers. 

Price for our family of 6 was $53. Great addition to Deerfoot City."}
{"text":"decent... i had the \"sin city\" burger. i liked it very much. my wife had a classic which i didnt like but i'm not sure what she had on it. she liked it so i guess thats what counts. the sweet potato fries werent that great. i didnt like the way they were seasoned. the regular fries were ok. all in all it was pretty good. its better than most fast food burgers...."}
{"text":"They really 'smash em, and they are so good!  My mom used to do this to her burgers, smash em down with a spatula while cooking.  This gives the patty a nice bit of crunch around the uneven perimeter, and somehow makes them moister.  Who knew this was a bold, creative technique that could be marketed as a gourmet treat?! Mom, we lost out! 

I had the chicken smasher and onion rings, everyone else had the beef burger.  We all agreed they were deeeelicious, and surprisingly juicy, which let's face it, is not what you'd expect from a smashed burger.

The atmoshpere is bright, modern pop art clean and cheery."}
{"text":"So this is the first time I've eaten at Smashburger, I was told by many people that it's one of the best burgers ever. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed.. don't get me wrong, it was delicious but just not what I expected. My boyfriend and I got the \"big\" burgers, and was disappointed at the size. Overall it was good and you can definitely taste the good quality ingredients but it wasn't for me. Not sure that I will spend money here again."}
{"text":"Heard about Smashburger and thought I'd give it a try. I would take an In & Out or Five Guys any day of the week over Smashburger. Very greasy. The Smash Frys were really good. I doubt I'll eat there again. I know there are a lot of people that like Smashburger and that's great. It's just not for me."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I ordered a hamburger and fries thru Postmates. I had high expectations from reading the reviews. Sadly mistaken.... hamburger was burnt and dry.  I would hope that a place that has the product in the name would have a great burger.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of fast food (or at least that is what people are supposed to say) but sometimes poor planning prevents a situation where one need to eat something quickly. I try to choose a place I have never tried before. This time, it was Smashburger. 

It is not as quick as your more common fast food places. Not at all. But I like the menu-alternatives alot once I stepped inside the doors.

I had the Smashburger. It was really good. It was dripping of all sorts of juices, and made it harder to eat - but the burger was good. Still just a burger, but for a burger it was tasty. I also had the smashfries (hints of garlic and rosemary) and they are thin, crispy and delicious.

The service are very polite, but they aren't very fast - but then again they are very polite. I take curtisy over speed any day."}
{"text":"Haven't been to one of these in awhile. Probably will not revisit this one. Fried pickles were Terrible. Super greasy, smelt like burnt oil, no breading. Like eating hot stinky pickles.sin city burger was Ok."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow.

We ordered
1.  Truffle Mushroom and Swiss with smash fries and a drink.
2 Classic Smash with no cheese with regular fries and a drink.
3. Big Spicy Baja with large smash fries and a drink.

It was rang in as three classic smash burgers with regular fries. Luckily he read it back so we were able to void some things to get the order right or so I thought. Guess what.... overcharged. 

While I was looking at my receipt I tried to get unsweetened tea. Well, they were out, leaving me a choice of sweetened teas as soda. I don't drink soda or sweetened tea so I asked them to make more unsweetened tea.

The guy at the register was annoyed when I brought my receipt up to get a refund for the overcharge.

While waiting for the refund, the front person decided it was as more important to clean counters and tables then make the tea I asked for. So I asked for a refund for my drink also.

Now on to when the food arrives and guess what? Wrong fries on my daughters order and I got a small Baja not a big one. Same guy delivers the food and when I point out the mistakes he asked what I wanted, I replied the manager. Now for the big reveal!!!! He is the manager. I told him it was ridiculous and to bring out the correct food. And the topper you ask? I had to ask the girl cleaning the tables earlier to get my daughters smash fries. The \"manager\" hid in the back.

If this is a corporate store, time to clean house. If this s is a franchise you also should consider doing something soon as by the other reviews you will not have a customer base left."}
{"text":"We picked up dinner from this place and they messed up on the order. My CHICKEN Cobb salad had no chicken and I asked for no cheese and I got cheese... And the kids all beef hot dog was horrible, they slice it in half and all the oil just formed a puddle of oil and my daughter refused to eat it and threw it to the dog. This was my 2nd time visiting the Smash Burger and the last."}
{"text":"Great food! Fries always seem overdone but they taste great. Wait can be long so get there early."}
{"text":"I agree with Paul V. This place is nothing to get excited about. The patties are so thin you can barely taste the meat. I had the Arizona burger because it sounded scrumptious. I was sorely disappointed. Even if the hamburger patty would have been thicker there were so many jalapenos and other toppings on it I felt like I was eating a jalapeno and guacamole sandwich. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food but my mouth was on fire and I ended up pulling off 4 slices of jalapenos to be able to even finish it. I also ordered the veggie frites because I thought they were battered and fried. I was wrong. It is simply green beans, carrots, and asparagus dropped in hot grease and covered in seasoning. If you are going to make a vegetable unhealthy, follow through on the commitment, don't just do it half heartedly. I did enjoy the fries but the BF didn't think they tasted strong enough like rosemary and garlic. The guy taking our order was very polite and friendly and did let us know that it would be about 20 minutes until we got our food. It was a bit longer than that which I kinda understand but don't. The place was packed but it is just quick cook hamburgers and fries.  For what we got and the quality of the food the price was totally high. For 2 burgers, 2 sides and 2 drinks it was $21 plus they serve you your food so a tip is involved which brought us up to $25! Again I have to agree with Paul V and say I'd rather save my money and go to Mickey D's."}
{"text":"SmashBurger was a place I would of never known about till my cousin Sindi said I need to try it. She said it has some amazing food and some awesome french fries. Being a food junky, I finally got off my lazy ass and headed over to SmashBurger after we had to drop off our son at his grandmas on the other side of town. On the way back, we found it and what a trip it was. It was trendy and modern style inside. Walk up to the counter and get greeted by a friendly staff. I ordered the Baja Burger with a side of Smash Fries. I went for the 1/3 pound size patty. It was topped with Pepperjack Cheese, fresh jalapenos, onions, tomato, lettuce and a chipotle mayo all nestled on a toasted Chipotle Bun. The Smash Fries were crispy Shoestring fries tossed in Olive Oil, Rosemary, and Garlic. OMG, it was amazing. The burger was crisp, yet juicy. The jalapenos slices burst like flavor crystals in your mouth. The veggies were crisp and cold. The bun was perfectly toasted yet soft and tasty. The Smash Fries were crispy and so damn flavorful it would make you wish it was Red Robin were you get ALL YOU CAN EAT!!. The wife ordered the Smash Chicken Sandwich. Perfectly seasoned smash seared piece of chicken heaven. Topped with tomatos, onions lettuce and pickles and light mayo. The toasted wheat bun was great. If only Subway's crappy bread was soft and toasted perfectly like SmashBurger. All in all, there is a big menu you can choose from. Las Vegas has its own burger with a fried egg. Ewww, Eggs on burgers are a sin. Whoever likes them, good for them lol. I would like to try the smash dog and Sweet potato fries, maybe even a salad. With a diverse menu, it'll definetly keep me coming back. Until next time, Let's Eat!!"}
{"text":"WOW, the burgers are first rate, much better than Five Guys, and yes, better than my beloved In-n-Out. The juiciest burger I have ever had."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to enjoy a dinner with hubby here last week.  The food is always really hot, extremely fast in preparation and delivery and the service is top notch.  5 stars all the way.  Love the Avocado chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"It was so good we went back the very next day. Terrific food, great service. It's definitely as good as Nine Guys or any of the other better-fast-food burger places."}
{"text":"In North Las Vegas for a few days and stopped by Smash Burger today. The food was so delicious! I had chicken and my husband had a beef burger. Both great! The fries were amazing! They have fried pickles too! Yum! The general manager Ryan was awesome! Incredibly friendly! He chatted with us for awhile and even helped us find a great place to hike. I'd definitely come back again. Might even go once more before we leave for home."}
{"text":"I ordered the bbq bacon burger and smashfries. Everything was seasoned well but the execution was off. My bacon was not crispy, and a little chewy. The burger needed a little more bbq sauce, it was barely noticeable. The fries were extremely greasy. The box that holds the fries had about 2tbs of oil at the bottom. My husband added blue cheese to his burger and it was never added even though we paid for it."}
{"text":"I wouldn't return to this location. It's filthy and possibly understaffed. We walked in around 1:15 ish on a Saturday.  There were plenty of families dining. There were exactly 6 tables completely filthy, old containers of food, lots of used napkins, etc. The bar seating area located by the window was completely clean. 

There were 4 of us in my party. The kids ordered a kids smash burger and a classic smash. My boyfriend ordered a turkey burger. It was extremely small, the same size as the kids smash. I ordered a classic Cobb with grilled chicken. I asked for no fried egg, add cranberries, ranch and balsamic dressing on the side. They forgot the cranberries and the ranch. The greens were wilted so the salad had absolutely no crunch. I plucked the parts of the greens that were turning brown out, too hungry to wait for another one. 

I also asked for a cup for water. The kind lady serving the food had to give me a regular soft drink cup because they had no more clean water cups. Makes you wonder what else could have been dirty in the kitchen. Again, I think it was so dirty in there because they seemed to be understaffed. One person on the register, one person serving the food."}
{"text":"My goodness!  Probably one of the greasiest burgers I've ever had from Smashburger.  I ordered the Triple Double.  I was too hungry to wait until I got back to the office to eat so I opened up the bag as soon as I got in my car.  I opened the package, grease dripped from the burger.  I had to use 2 napkins to drain some of the grease from the burger.  I took one bite, grease and cheese dripped down my hand ... Gross!  I took another bite, grilled onions and grease dripped down my hand ... Gross!  Just wayyyyyy too much grease.  Previous visits to different SmashBurger locations I've requested them to drain the grilled onions before putting them.  I didn't this time.  I thought about it immediately after ordering but didn't think twice about it.  I regret that.  The cashier was kind and it didn't take long for my order to be made.  
It was just way too greasy to eat or enjoy.  I could only get through almost half.  The majority of it I couldn't eat, it went to the trash."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Smashburger joint, and I wasn't disappointed! My friend took me here for lunch and I ordered the Arizona burger and SmashFries. Yummy!!! 

The Arizona burger was cooked just right and was supremely delicious! The SmashFries were a-ok, but not anything spectacular. I ordered the regular burger and I should have went with the small burger! The regular was way tooo big for one lady to finish alone....anyway, a great place for a great burger!"}
{"text":"Was craving a burger and shake this afternoon and just dropped the truck off at the dealership for an oil change, so I figured Smash Burger was perfect. 

My dog with me outside?...check
Awesome bacon cheese burger?...check
Nutter butter shake?....\"we're out of shakes...didn't have enough time to prep.....don't even have a clean glass\"

Not even a ,\"it might take a minute\", just a straight up \"nope, all out\". Thank you AM 2 CASHIER.

When I broke the news to my wife outside, the awesome Claire over hears and asks me why somebody would say they were out of shakes. And  shortly delivers me a shake after ensuring me it was a mistake.

Thank you Claire for being awesome and extremely professional and completing my perfect lunch."}
{"text":"This place has me hooked! Great location, nice clean open dining area with comfortable seating. Service is pretty good, but Janelle isn't my favorite...She can seem a bit rude. The managers are great though, always around. 

Wish the fires weren't so skinny...They'd have more flavor if you could actually taste them more, but the SmashChicken is to die for. Sometimes you get it so fast that it's still overly juicy, I think that's why some people complain about the grease (or maybe their burgers are greasy, I just love the chicken)."}
{"text":"Tried Smashburger for the first time today. Got no help from the girl taking my order. Burger was dry overlooked and flavorless. Multi grain bum was great. Tomatoes and lettuce were fresh, but the tomatoes where on the small side. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Better than fast food and great when you don't want to drive all the way to steak and shake, my first fast burger love... They have great burgers and a variety of fries and veggie sides even!  Also they are always really fast! Yummy..."}
{"text":"It was alright but i find the burgers to be bland. The root beer float was delicious."}
{"text":"Smashburger is a wonderful place for a great burger.  We used to go Fuddruckers but now go to Smashburger.  My wife and I split the Big Burger with grilled onions, lettuce and tomato.  the Burger tastes wonderful.  You do not need to add Ketchup or anything else to it.  The big burger is plenty for the two of us. The regular fries are thin and nice and crisp.  I am not a fan of sweet potato fries but my wife says that they are excellent.   We probably go at least once a week.  I complete the on-line survey and get my fries for free.   The Grandkids are fans also.  The staff are always warm and friendly.   The only thing that would make us happier is if they offered 1/2 regular and 1/2 sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time. My boyfriend and I ordered the build your own black bean burger. (We're vegetarians). The burger itself was good, but the fries were far from it. They were extremely greasy and left a film of grease in my mouth so bad that I didn't finish them. needless to say it's a \"been there, ate that\" kinda place. No reason to ever go back. On the upside, the customer service was good."}
{"text":"I arrived at 10:30 a.m and was told right off the bat my order would take 1/2 an hour due to large orders that were phoned in previous to me walking in. 

Subsequently the girl at the till was telling all patrons their order would take this long. 

It didn't seem to deter anyone from ordering burgers. I came with my two young boys who ordered hotdogs, (in a place known for burgers). I ordered an All American.
The establishment itself wasn't very busy itself, maybe 6 or 7 other people seated at three separate tables. Like the girl said when she took my order, it took about 25 minutes before our order came out. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention if you eat-in they give you a plastic number thingy to put on your table. When your order is ready, they bring it out to your table. When they brought my order, they gentleman working there brought me a classic burger. I had ordered an All American, but I wasn't about to say anything and wait another 25min. Also the fries were extremely greasy, like they had been deepfried twice (reheated in the deepfryer). I only say this because the burgers were probrably not coming out with the fries at the same time. They were getting backed up in the kitchen. 
It was getting just past 11:00 a.m. now and you could see a line start to form inside the door. I had seen a couple of people pick large orders consisting of 4 to 5 bags of hamburgers. These aren't your typical small bags, but look more like tote bags you would use to put a larger parcel in.

In closing I would have to say, my experience with Smash Burger wasn't spectacular. Maybe because I went in with high expectations, and with the long wait times and the greasiness and all. I just wasn't impressed.

I will give it another shot down the road and order something different next time though.
In recognigtion of the long wait times, the manager gave some of the patrons a ten dollar coupon for a return visit. I guess I can use mine on a return visit.
I hope the fries are better then. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention they were seasoned with I think a bit of oregano ?"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place, my first time here when I came with my ex chris.
Me and bob were walking from the bank, both of our stomach growled, it was so funny, we were hungry for something filling, so we looked around to see what was near us, we saw a In and out burger and right next to it was a smash burger, our eyes lit up. I been craving a good burger. I wanted to try the spicy Baja,(was 5.99 since I got the smash size) I was on a diet, but it looked good so I got that, my bob ordered the bacon cheeseburger(was $6.99 big smash) and a large drink  which was $1.89. Came out to to 14.87 which is not bad if you want a really good burger. 
The tables were nice and clean and customer service was good, but I wasn't say great cause they kept on passing us by when we wanted something. 

We sat right in the middle, our burger's were ready in 15 min, which was great cause we were starving, Were are not crazy about the fries, so we just got the burger. They were so messy, so glad that they had napkins on each table. I loved there sauces, I was a happy girl when I got done eating that burger, so was bob. I think I will get that Spicy Baja again, was SO GOOD, I recommend it!!


This place is perfect for a little snack or if you are on a budget, its a little bit more for the burger's but hey, its worth it. Your mouths will be watering for there taste!

(sorry I didn't take any pics) I will try to next time I go out."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Smashburger. Their food is always great and service is almost always top notch. With that being said, however, this particular location has been going thru a lot of changes lately. Most of the staff there is new, and management is not the same. My wife and I went there last night and ordered the BBQ, Bacon & Cheddar burger with the bun on the side (we were taking it to go), and the Buffalo & Blue Cheese grilled chicken. My wife is gluten free and they are great at trying to get everything you need for a gluten free meal. The part that we had a slight problem with was the toppings for the burger with the bun on the side. My wife doesn't like soggy bread (who does?) so when they put the burger in its container all the toppings were there, but there was no mustard, no ketchup, no BBQ sauce. I double checked the order before we left and there wasn't even little packets of mustard, ketchup or BBQ. That's what goes on the burger when the bun is there soooooo what the heck? When I asked the guy at the to-go counter he acted like it was no big deal for our order to be the way it was. So then when we got home my Buffalo & Blue Cheese chicken sandwich was just chicken, barely any blue cheese and seriously 1 dab of hot sauce. It was the absolute driest sandwich I've ever had. When I tried to call them to complain the phone number listed on Google, Yelp and other places won't even ring thru to the store. So I called the newer Smashburger on Baseline & Power, they had the same number. However, that the GM at that store asked what had happened and I explained the entire thing. He said come in the next day and that his store would take care the entire meal. I give HUGE kudos for that. While the review and stars for this store is low (for now), we do love Smashburger and hope that they get some good staff in there again soon."}
{"text":"Yummy we were staying at the rio hotel, and wanted a midnight snack, so we popped into smash burger, they have the Vegas special burger with bacon, egg, cheese and meat, really good highly recommend."}
{"text":"The bun was amazing!  Great variety of toppings.  Garlic fries were not that special.  The meat was quality for the price.  The line was to the door and they were slow...but for quality it was worth it."}
{"text":"My honey ordered me a black bean burger.  It was gross!  Besides looking like a cow pie, it is spicy but with little flavor.  The avocado was not ripe & hard. I had to pick then off.  The fries are shoe string fries..which I hate because they have no flavor..just grease. 

All around..I picked of the soggy bun, the wilted lettuce & the hard avocado.  I took 3 bites &  threw the rest away. I ate one bite of the fries and the threw the rest away.  What a waste of money."}
{"text":"FOUND A BUG IN MY FOOD. Have been eating smash burger for years as its one of the few places who have a black bean burger but I will never go back to this location! After almost finishing my burger I notice a big black beetle running out of my burger. Super gross. When I called they just took my number and said the gm would call me back. Seriously? I'm calling the health department!"}
{"text":"I would have taken a picture of all the amazing food my friends and I ordered but there was no time. It all looked so good and smelt so wonderful. Everything was absolutely incredible. I don't think I have ever had a burger so delicious, crispy and full of flavour. The fries are to die for and the milkshakes... Don't leave without getting one!!! Don't think for a second that you shouldn't check this place out, and after you do you will probably never go to another burger joint again."}
{"text":"I order to go from this location a couple of times a month. The staff is great and i am always greeted with a BIG hello and smile. I get the Classic and my son gets the the Sin City burger. Our food has always been on point (tasted great). Hats off to kitchen staff. Also Julie (manager) and Mindy (cashier) have the best attitudes that seems to flow to the rest of the staff. 
Thank you!
Jorge"}
{"text":"Decent spot, I was brought here by a local. I had a sin city burger on his recommendation and it was pretty great- egg, bacon, cheese, onion (both grilled *and* fried onions, on top of a 1/3lb patty. The patty itself was pretty good, a bit on the salty side. The smash fries were great, tossed with olive oil, sea salt, and rosemary, it added a touch of class to the lowly french fry. 
My friend got a milkshake and I tried it... it was mediocre at best. It didn't even taste like they used chocolate syrup, maybe cocoa powder and vanilla ice cream? Sub-par from what I'm used to at these types of places. 

My general complaint about the burger, though, is that it tries too hard to be so greasy. The bacon, for example, could be cooked to the exact same level of crispiness without having so much grease left on them by cooking it in the oven and finishing it off on the flattop. Same thing with the egg, it didn't need the extra squirt of clarified butter on it, eggs cooked on a flattop are plenty tasty on their own.

I would come here again, but probably not order the sin city burger due to its massive heft and overabundance of grease."}
{"text":"I first ate at smashburger when I lived in Missouri and was an instant fan. I have tried all of their burgers and chicken sandwiches and have never been disappointed. The restaurant and bathroom has been clean every time i have use it, which is amazing considering how many people are in and out of this place. They have this chipolte dip that goes really good with their fries. With this location I am always impressed with the consistency of their customer service, their staff is always friendly. I would defiantly recommend eating here and make sure to sign up for their loyalty club."}
{"text":"I usually don't review chains, but this spot is very good. I first went on Friday because I found a buy one get one free chicken sandwich coupon online. They have 5 or 6 different specialty chicken sandwiches and you can get it grilled or fried. I opted for the grilled chicken sandwich with portabello mushrooms and swiss cheese. It came on an egg bun and was DELICIOUS!  I also split an order of the smash fries, great fries with olive oil, garlic and rosemary. They were great too. I enjoyed my meal so much I went to another location by my house for lunch again over the weekend. The sandwiches were inconsistent, but both good. Teh service was good at both locations and the prices were great. Teh sandwiches were $7.00 and well worth it. The fries were $2. I also got a cup of chili the 2nd trip and it was great as well and only cost $2. They've got a new fan but PLEASE be more consistent on the food from location to location."}
{"text":"My food was sloppy and half filled, for the price I'm super disappointed! This was my first and last visit to smash burger. I contacted the corporate for a resolution before posting this but I haven't heard back from them in over 48 hrs. So on top of bad food, bad presentation and high prices lets add poor customer service."}
{"text":"If I could give it half a star they would get none. Worst experience Ever! Placed a pick up order over the phone with \"Jose\". Who Needs to be retrained on customer service, courtesy/politeness, and order taking so he doesn't simply assume for the customer. Too many wrongs on what should had been a simple salad order."}
{"text":"Food is always great but the customer service exceeds most places. All the employees are friendly, welcoming, and helpful. For these reasons we will keep coming back"}
{"text":"I had a grilled chicken burger and my boyfriend had a regular smash burger. We ordered one small fries as well - all to go.  Strangely, there were two bags used for our small order that came to a hefty eighteen dollars. Both of us enjoyed our burgers but they were too small for a satisfying meal. My boyfriend called them regarding the missing fries and they offered a compensation, but I would have just preferred that we had gotten what we had paid for in the first place."}
{"text":"This place was pretty hyped up to me. I was in anticipation of something great. I can overlook the fact that my order was screwed up and had to be remade - that can happen anywhere. I got the fries in the olive oil and they did taste good, but were soggy and the bottom ones were left in an oil \"soup.\" The burger itself was unremarkable. The meat did seem to have a specific taste to it, but any taste it had was overshadowed by the large bun. It's almost as if the burger had no taste at all. In the end, my throat was coated by something in either the fries or the burger that I was attempting to spit out all day, and similar to another review I read, I had a stomachache for the rest of the night.

On the plus side, the service was great and the people were really nice.

Maybe the stomach issue could be attibuted to the fact that I'm not for the most part used to grossly unhealthy food. If I ate McDonald's after years of not touching it, I would have a similar experience. Given the option, I would instead go \"Fat\", \"Five\", or just go in and out.

I can't imagine that I would return here."}
{"text":"Great burgers and sandwiches. Its not my favorite place, but I'll come again.aybe try a different location next time."}
{"text":"Best burger spot around the area. Great service,  tasty burgers, and the prices aren't bad"}
{"text":"Smashburger was simply ok. The food was not horrible, but based on overall value, it is not that great. It is expensive for what is served."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Smashburger yesterday and had a good experience trying a new burger place.  We had heard good things about it from our friends at Tastecasting (tastecasting.org) and were anxious to see how it compared to other burger places in Tempe such as Five Guys and The Chuckbox.

Their burgers are great as are their mint oreo milkshakes!

It is a great place and has the best chicken smash salad around. YUM.  It's usually packed full of people; however I've also been there in the evening when school is out and there aren't many if anyone else in the place.

The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars is that whether they are packed with a line out the door or if they are empty they are a bit slow.  It usually takes a good 10-15 minutes to get my order."}
{"text":"The name makes it sound tasty, I wish that were true! I tried the Avocado Club Burger. Good tasting beef, but the burger was kinda bland! My fries quickly cooled down to the point of being cold and unappealing. I really wanted to smash the hell outta my food, unfortunately this meal was without excitement."}
{"text":"Ordered our food online to pick up at 1:45pm. Showed up a little late at about 1:55pm only to wait 15+ minutes for the two piss poor employees working there to make ONE milkshake. One of bags they were going to let us leave with that was containing our food was absolutely drenched with grease on the bottom. Had to request a new bag ourselves. Got home only to find the fries and tater tots were ice cold, the burgers were sloppy and just covered in an over-abundance of sauce and ketchup, and the meat was very undercooked on both burgers. They don't even deserve the one star I'm giving them. This place needs to be shut down."}
{"text":"The last time I was in this location, I found a bone in my buffalo chicken sandwich.  The manager handled it very well but still scary that a bone was found in what was supposed to be a boneless chicken.

So I gave this location another try.  AWFUL!!!   They just slapped my buffalo chicken sandwich together, did not care that I did not want bleu cheese.  Also, I asked for a to-go cup for water and I get handed what is essentially a baby's cup.  The cashier told me I had to pay for the regular size cup.  

Also, the tables are wobbly and no one cleans the booths or the chairs.  Customers are having to wipe their chairs and booths just so they can sit down.  Filthy!!!

My reaction is pretty simple.  They lost my business forever especially after deciding to be penny-wise/dollar foolish with customer service.  That regular sized cup probably costs them $0.25 but now they lost $10 in revenue."}
{"text":"They forgot to put a burger on my mom's burger :( ... also for the added charge of $1 I got about six tiny haystack onions, also salty ... never going back."}
{"text":"Always delicious food. Writing this review for one instance in particular. Called the store to place a to-go order 3 times w/ no answer...Once I got there Sharon L. @ the counter was super polite, friendly & apologetic. They were packed @ 2 pm with only 3 people on staff... 1 of the cooks left mid way so now 2 associates working the whole store with no management?! What if an associate has an injury or emergency & needs to leave, who do they turn to??? I question the stores priority of safety and accountability because of this. This is why I'm giving 3 stars on this review!!! I have to give kuddos to the employees & the way they handled the unexpected rush. I did find it disappointing to hear the manager just left during the rush because it was their \"scheduled\" time to go...maybe it's just me but there is a reason your a manager. I tend to see this poor management structure & situations when businesses pay their management hourly & not salary! Bottom line your management...when your store is full, you don't leave...no matter what that schedule says...this manager left the store full with 3 associates and a line, that is not my idea of team management, that's team abandonment. Despite the bad taste of the scenario, the way Sharon handled it and treated every customer even though there was clear frustration, made the long wait acceptable, I understood! I also understand Sharon needs to be the manager!"}
{"text":"Should you order a salad at a burger joint? It's ok here. The Baja salad was large enough to be served family style over at Olive Garden. The greens were fresh, the chicken tasty, the avocado pleasing. Unfortunately, the dressing was somewhat elusive. We also had burgers and fries. The sweet potato fries were excellent. 

A special mention for the young man who chased us down in the parking lot to tell us our son left his iPod behind. Give that boy a promotion."}
{"text":"This was the first time I'd ever been to a Smashburger.The  place was clean. And now onto the food. 
 I tried my buddies chili cheese fries and I found it a bit odd that the fries were really thin. I got  the sin city burger and I added mushrooms. The grilled onions needed to cook a little longer. My egg was fully cooked and I prefer my yolk runny but then again it was really delicious. The burger was a tad oversalted. These are all small complaints. I added the fresh jalepenos on my burger from my buddies chili cheese fries and they gave it a nice heat. It really was a solid burger. I would definitely eat here again. I wasn't even that hungry and when I was done my burger looked like a high school virgin after prom night... non-existent.  The ice tea however, was  not fresh and flat out disgusting."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers.   Blows 5 guys out of the water. This was our first time here, but not the last. 

Service was good too."}
{"text":"I've visited many Smashburger restaurants in the valley, but last Friday night we went to this one, and it had to be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. To begin with, after standing in the slow-moving line for 20 minutes, we were told that it would be about 20 minutes before we got our food. They should post a sign on the door if this is the case so we don't stand in line forever before finding this out. It turned out to be more than 30 minutes! There was trash and food laying all over the floor, they got our order wrong, and they told us they were out of ranch. Since my granddaughter 'requires' ranch, I left and drove to a nearby grocery store to get her some ranch. When I returned, our order still had not been corrected. AND the table next to us had just asked for, AND RECEIVED, ranch dressing!! Infuriating! I will not go back to this location! I'm only giving it one star because of the good laugh we got when we were able to share our ranch dressing with some friends dining on the patio who had also asked for some and been denied!"}
{"text":"Extremely terrible service. My friend ordered a gluten free bun and was not given one. When she finished her burger and realized it wasn't gluten, she went up to the manager who was very rude. They blamed her for not paying attention to her order and looking at the screen when that is not her job!!!! Very upset that my friend was blamed for not \"paying attention\" and was blamed for her allergy.DO NOT GO HERE EVER!!! Worst experience I have ever had. I can't believe the terrible service that we experienced and they should not have placed the blame on my friend!!! TERRIBLE RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"GreAt and quick service at this location as usual. Food was fresh and hot.  Tried the sin city burger and was surprised at how good it was, also the Brussel sprouts were surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"I appreciate what my lil homie MEANT to do when he recommended this place BUTTT... To begin with they didn't have the pretzel bun I saw on the website and I REALLY wanted to try that. The restaurant wasn't crowded but we stil sat down at a dirty table. When my husband asked for it to be cleaned it was done but not well. My husband actually asked for a towel so he could clean it himself, and of course that didn't sit well with the staff. My daughter's order of Rosemary and olive oil tossed fries had a pool of oil at the bottom AND when she was grossed out and went to the bathroom feeling nauseous a grown man walked in on her!!!! Not ok. My sandwich itself was very fresh but my lettuce leaf was so big I had to break and fold it over again. My meat flavor was just ok,nothing to rave about but it was WAY too salty. I'm sure that was a mistake. They didn't serve bad food, but I can cross this place of my to do list.  Been here done this... I won't be back. But the lady who took our order was very nice. Until we needed the table wiped."}
{"text":"Food was very SALTY... BAD service... rude employee... Said... Have to kick you out... We are closed... Could have said it in a nicer way... Not coming back here... Sticking to In and Out..."}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Baja burger with side salad with chipotle dressing both times I ate at Smash Burger.
The servers were more attentive the first time I was here- checking back to get you drink refills. And giving coupons for free sides. Not so much this second trip. A good value and pleasant atmosphere. Burgers are tasty!"}
{"text":"To be honest, it's just on \"okay\" burger. Nothing has ever wowed me here for the price. The atmosphere is odd and often greasy, but the service makes up for it. 
I still put Smashburger under In and Out for sure. It's similar from a price perspective, and just more convenient. 
Johnny Rockets when they were still at Norterra I thought made a better burger."}
{"text":"There will come a time in the not so distance future when I will not be able to partake in the greasy joy of a Smashburger.  Every day is a day older and hopefully not a day closer to a heart stint.

Rolled in with the work wife while the rest of the valley was in the midst of their lunch hour.  Zero wait and I again stared at the menu in amazement.  The lady behind the counter was friendly and patiently waited while I scanned the menu.

Vegas is sin and so was the burger ordered.  The Sin City Burger is a delectable hamburger containing cheese, bacon, grilled onions, fired onions, and a fried egg.  

I ordered up some Smash Fries which are tossed in olive oil, rosemary and garlic.  The was no need to spoil these delightful flavors with ketchup or ranch.

Parking can be a bit of bitch but do not worry.  They have a back entrance which can accessed from the much larger parking lot in the rear."}
{"text":"I went to Smash Burger for the first time this weekend and got a burger and some chicken strips. I thought the chicken strips were very tender and all the toppings on the burger seemed fresh. Overall, very good!"}
{"text":"For all the hype, I didn't find the burgers to be too great. Been to this location once and the one at Tempe Marketplace. Both are the same and I still do not care to eat here. I would rather eat at Five Guys!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars are for the food only! The service on this visit was less than best! They screwed the complete order. Dont order when there's a long line, and the little old lady seems less than competent. Gonna be awhile before I'm back. Should've went next door to taco y taco"}
{"text":"Not sure how healthy it is for you but dang is it good! Smashed it! Best name ever gets them five stars.

Ordered the chicken burger and the piece of chicken was way bigger than the bun, which I love because usually the bun overwhelms the chicken. 

Chicken was tender and crispy and great touch with the Frank's hot red sauce. 

Good vibes inside, young and energetic yet Professional staff. 

Do it!"}
{"text":"The best place for a burger in the Desert Ridge food court. Our whole group enjoyed their food there were no complaints. I ordered the Classic Smash Burger with Smash fires. My food was great! I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger a dog and some fries to go. Unfortunately, there was no dog in the bag when I got home. Pretty lame. It isn't that difficult."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time since the boyfriend always have good things to say about this place and it did not disappoint. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Place is clean since its new so hopefully it will stay this way. 

Smash deserves 5 star if I'm rating the burgers only but since they serve more than just burgers, I have to rate everything. 

+ the buns are so soft!!!! 
+ LOVE the fact that you can customize a burger to your liking 
+ they have 'pre-made' burgers as well so you can just pick from one of the classics without having to decide on every last detail of your burger
+ don't like beef? They have chicken!!! 
+ friendly service 

- smash fries came out cold, I can see potential if it came out fresh 
- pickle fries were way too salty and no sour-ness that pickles offer at all. 

Definitely would come back to eat and also try other things on their menu (:"}
{"text":"I think that thier menu is great . They have plenty of options . customer service is fine and food comes quickly ! They even have hagan daz shakes ..I so need to try !"}
{"text":"I'm usually a huge fan of this chain but my last few visits to this particular location have been underwhelming- their smashed-to-perfection patties have been dismally overcooked to beyond medium both times I've chosen them over competitors recently.

Favorite burgers here include the stellar truffle mushroom swiss and a distant second-choice in the spinach and goat cheese. Love that all burgers can be made into a salad, which gives a surprisingly healthy option at a burger chain- the salads here are fresh and huge instead of an obligatory afterthought as at other burger places.

Staff is friendly, location seems to do well being positioned across from a college."}
{"text":"My husband had the Bacon Cheeseburger and he liked it. The only issue he had with it was that the cheeseburger was kind of small for the amount that your paying for it.

I had the chicken tenders with BBQ sauce. They were delicious and pretty big. The lady that took order was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Omg this place is filthy! Carpet under tables is disgusting, tile is dirty, the men's room was worse than a truckstop bathroom...the urinal doesn't flush, shit around the rim of the toilet, paper on the floor...disgusting! I don't even want to see the kitchen! And they have the nerve to post on the inside of the men's room door that their restrooms are \"sparkley\".  Not in a million years! This place needs to be hosed down with some bleach and degreaser. Nasty!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but come on- one cashier during lunch? During Barrett Jackson week? Let's go guys!"}
{"text":"Typical \"burger joint\" of the \"future\" - better burger than say a wendys but for $15-$20 I just dont get these alacarte type places. For the money it should come with fries and a drink. And should be easy. Nothing special and probably will go back simply because its near my home."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this location. The staff that is here is hard working and friendly. Other then the fact that they are a little understaffed, this location is fantastic. The food is delicious. Burgers are juicy and their Smash Cobb Salad is my favorite! The team that is here handles to work load well tho"}

{"text":"We have visited this Smashburger on 59th Ave and Thunderbird several times and every time we have gone in this location the place is always very dirty like they don't have time to clean the floors or wipe tables. They are not consistent when we get our food at times the burger is good and times it's over cooked and dry but our biggest concern is this place always not being cleaned especially when we have gone in and we are the only people in the place and why when it's slow no one is cleaning?? We like their food but have decided to go to a different location and hope it's more consistent and CLEAN...."}
{"text":"The food here is great but you can get that at any smash burger... More importantly the service here is great. They are always very friendly and the service is fast... The manager is very outgoing and attentive... We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried this Smashburger on a Sunday afternoon for the first time. We were both disappointed slightly. I ordered the Sin City burger which comes with a fried egg, bacon American cheese, grilled onions and onion strings as well as their smash sauce. The burger was served hot. Very hot. So hot that it never cooled off. I have no idea how it stayed so hot that I was still burning my tongue on the last bite. I wish that the egg had been slightly runny but with the sandwich that hot it didn't stand a chance. Even if it had been runny when put on the burger the yolk would have cooked in the time it took me to get to it. So while tasty the burger was a bit dry. My hubby ordered the new Mushroom Swiss burger in a big size. He loved the egg bun. His burger was not hot. He enjoyed the tasted, but said it wasn't anything special.  He also thinks that \" big \" means they simply smash the burger so much that it hangs over the side of the bun more because my burger was thicker than his. Our sides were both served cold. Hubby asked for the Smashed fries which are supposed to have olive oil, garlic and rosemary. The flavor fell flat. I ordered onion strings. They were okay but the ranch I requested tasted like it came out of a bottle and I hate bottled ranch. Its so easy to make that companies that cheap out this way always piss me off. We both agreed to try a different location of SmashBurger and hope for better results. The staff was pleasant but didn't go out if their way to help obvious new customers. The men's restroom did not have soap so I hope they had some in the kitchen for the staff to use after they visited. The ladies room was fine. The restaurant itself was clean and the staff was quick to bus the tables after each guest left."}
{"text":"I came here about a year ago with my husband because my uncle actually recommended eating here. The customer service was great and the staff was friendly. The restaurant was very clean and smelled very nice. However, the prices are a little high in my opinion for what you're getting. The burger was average. Almost like an in-n-out burger but overpriced. The fries were seasoned very good but the fries were severely oily and were soggy within a few minutes. Overall, it wasn't a bad place. I would try it again to see if I have a change of opinion."}
{"text":"Customer service is beyond excellent! People here are super friendly and they are fast enough to not keep me waiting but slow enough to taste amazing!"}
{"text":"I walked in a was greeted with a awesome smile and the place was clean and everything, when my food arrived I was blown away with it, awesome taste and everything thank you guys now I need a nap"}
{"text":"Rolled out to SmashBurger with my GF and the Boy.  While staring at the menu it was hard to chose which on would make an impression on me  See the that Sin City burger was fried egg and bacon I knew that was the one to chow down on.  I chose the Fried Pickles because it something different than what I would normally order.

The crew ordered up a Classic with sweet potato fries and an All American with Smash Fries.

There is an enormous selection of extras to trick out any burger you order.

When you get there and wonder what the difference between a Regular Smash and the Big Smash...The regular smash patty will not fall out the sides of the burger while the big smash will extend past the bun.

I found everything to be fresh and cooked to a very high standard.  It hit out table in no time flat.

All was consumed with smiles."}
{"text":"I went there with my son for lunch today. Overall we had a very good experience. The lady who took and brought us our order was very friendly and courteous. The food was good for a moderately priced burger place. There is a good variety of selections on the menu. The location right at Sahara and Fort Apache is convenient and with plenty of parking. Great place for a good burger and fries."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst! Placed our order online tonight. Arrived to pick it up at 8pm. There were no customers in the restaurant. Walk up to the counter and the cashier is on the phone taking an order. After standing there for several minutes someone from the kitchen walks up and still we get no acknowledgement from either employee. Terrible customer service. Walked out and will never go back."}
{"text":"AMAZING burgers, and they have beer!! What more could you ask for? They have some local craft brews that are great too"}
{"text":"Whoa! A Smashburger in NKY?! I circled back around for lunch. I've heard great things about this burger chain, but never had the chance to try it since all the locations were up near Mason. Not anymore! Located next to the Chipotle and Jimmy John's by NKU, I discovered this Smashburger just opened mid-October.

Inside were sleek stainless steel walls and red booths; a very hip burger joint. The waitstaff were friendly, but it was clear they were still learning the ropes of a new restaurant. I ordered the following:

 - Smashburger: hand-pressed beef patty with lettuce, tomato, pepperjack, ranch, BBQ sauce, guacamole, and haystack onions on an egg bun.
 - Smashfries (tossed with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic).

The food was prepared quickly, and the cook yells \"Smashup!\" when the order is ready for the server. I got my burger to go, which arrived in a paper sack with grease dripping through the bag. That's how you know it's a good, juicy burger.

Upon arriving home, I bit into my delicious burger... then noticed something was missing. Several things, actually. There was no BBQ, Ranch, or haystack onions on my sandwich! I can understand forgetting one ingredient, but THREE? Especially when some of those were premium toppings that I paid extra for. That alone almost bumped this review to two stars.

Fortunately, the Smashfries saved the day. Their unique seasoning is amazing, and at only $1.99 for a large, they are some serious competition for Senate's Truffle Frites. 

Overall, my burger was quite tasty, but I wish I had received all the toppings I paid for. I'd like to go back to try the chicken sandwich and Veggie Frites (fried asparagus, carrot sticks and green beans), but I think I'll wait a month or two until the restaurant gets the hang of operations.

Price per person: $10.00"}
{"text":"Came here the other day to get some lunch. I've had smash burger before at other locations and I have to say not only is the food great, but the customer service at all of them is as well! Unfortunately my rewards point didn't show up, but both the cashier and manager helped me to the best of their abilities by giving me the points to make of for whatever technical error had occurred. Also, staff was extremely friendly like expected. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Overpriced!! Rather go to the nearby in-n-out next time where it's half the price and better tasting burger."}
{"text":"for a chain, they are pretty darn good. Arizona Smash is my fave, and their vegetable fries are awsome!"}
{"text":"We called an order in for take out. I was asked to hold while the in-store customers were handled. The food was cold and sloppy. The buns were soggy from the condiments and assembled half heartedly. We were disappointed"}
{"text":"Just not good, over cooked, bacon burned, tomatoes and lettuce look iffy, not eating them. First and last time to eat here. Sorry wrong location, this review is for the Queen Creek smash burger, although I probably will never try another Smash Burger."}
{"text":"We recently came here after hiking Camalback Mountain and I have to say that the burger and fries that I ordered definitly hit the spot.  

As a first time visitor to Smashburger I decided to go with the Arizona Smashburger which is Habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, onion, chipotle mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun.  It also comes with tomatoes, but I don't do tomatoes because I think they are disgusting.  Don't get me wrong, I like tomato sauce...unless of course it has big chunks of tomatoes in it.  I like salsa, unless it also has big chunks of tomatoes in it or if it tastes too much like fresh tomatoes.  

Well anyway this burger was pretty freagin good and I highly recommend it as a fast food option.  

I also ordered the smash fries which were a perfect compliment to my burger!"}
{"text":"Please don't waist your time and money if you care about quality food, service, and cleaning.
I ordered a burguer, with sweet potatoes fries and some fries with rosemary, it was over cooked, the fries ver very tiny, so, dry. The drink area dirty, sticky, trash everywhere. More than the 40% of the tables were with the leftovers and thrash. and the restrooms... well you can imagine. . Floors. Everything was a complete \"Zero\" in a scale from 0-10. Nobody cleans?? Not coming anymore."}
{"text":"I called at 10:08am. Just minutes after they opened. The man said they would have my black bean burger + grilled chicken club AND Oreo Chase's within minutes. Who gets to work that FAST and EAGER?? Soo happy! I was in a rush and breakfast was SERVED! THANK YOU"}
{"text":"Found a free SIDE coupon, so had to try this place. The Arizona burger was really delicious. It was $5.99. And my hubs had the Arizona grilled chicken burger. 

The sweet potato fries were fabulous. They're made with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. If you dine in, they do bring your food to your table which is a nice treat. 

While I enjoyed this place, I still think In N Out is the best burger place. (And it's must cheaper too.)"}
{"text":"3 stars you say?
It's because of the customer service. The girl that \"helped\" us with our order was a sour, snot of a girl. We were confused about the sizes of fries that came with the combo, we asked her about it and she was just rude.  Not willing to break out down fire us and offer up any other suggestions.
the lady that brought our food out was sweet.
The burger was great, as always.
I just feel like the front counter people should be a lot more friendly since they are the first person we see and interact with.  
I love Smashburger and I'll continue to come because of the quality of food.
That being said, that visit left a bad impression."}
{"text":"So you roll meat into a ball, and they smash it, smash burger. easy concept. Tried what everyone has been talking about, and that is their Sin City Burger. Applewood smoked bacon, haystack onions, grilled onions and a fried egg. All served with what they call their smash sauce. Couldn't really get a distinct flavor with their smash sauce, had so many other things going for it in that one burger alone. But the burger was great. Came out fresh of course and juicy, can't go wrong. Had their Smash Fries as well, flavors weren't overpowering.great flavor overall. Wanting to go back to try the other stuff they got."}
{"text":"They do not know how to properly cook up a burger at all. They need better training or need to hire some new employees. The meat was so damn dry, the entire burger was just ehh, not even close to being worth $6. You're better off going to a different smashburger because this is by far the shittiest smashburger in Arizona. I do not care about customer service, just cook up a $6 dollar burger how it's suppose to be cooked up. Ive been to tons of smashburgers so take my word for it that this place does not know how to cook food."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times and their burgers were always on point. I went to the new smashburgers on 51st avenue and baseline ONCE and will NEVER go there again. If you want what you pay for, I highly recommend this smashburger over the one on 51st avenue and baseline."}
{"text":"Staff were very friendly and helped narrow down the choices since it all sounded so delicious! We ordered a Sin City and a Truffle Mushroom Swiss. 

The Sin City is topped with a fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, haystack onions, grilled onions, American cheese, and smash sauce. Unfortunately the egg was cooked through instead of having a runny yolk which would have made that burger incredible! 

The Truffle Mushroom Swiss is topped with sautéed crimini mushrooms, aged Swiss and truffle mayo. This was definitely a very rich tasting burger. But I wish that there were more mushrooms! 

I love the egg bun that they use and will request to have it toasted on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Walked by the overflowing garbage cans to get in to the restaurant. Went to wash my hands and it was occupied. So I waited. A young girl exited the mens room and i went in to wash my hands. 
   I was with a friend. We both ordered and he gasped a little when the cashier said it was 23.00 for two bacon cheeseburgers two fries and two medium drinks. The guy heard him and said .\"it is so worth it\".  It wasn't so worth it. The burger was mediocre at best, the shoestring fries were cold. All in all not a great value. Having to walk by garbage in the way in should have been the first red flag....wont be back."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would this is literally the worst smash burger in the entire world. After ringing up my order completely wrong then fixing it they still brought out the wrong order. I ordered a milkshake and stepped outside and walked back inside and they didn't make it because They thought I must've just not wanted it. The next time I went back with my husband and he ate half of his burger before realizing that they never took the paper off the cheese. I ordered a spinach salad and then 10 minutes later they told me they were out of spinach. I absolutely hate this place"}
{"text":"So why I keep trying his place I don't know, maybe because they send me buy one get one free coupons, I guess you get what you pay for! Three times I have been there first they never ever ever ever ever answer the phone so if your a busy family looking to order ahead you can forget it! They never answer it rings and rings and rings and goes to a fax or a vm! Second time I went ordered and waited wanted a hot dog for my kid it's on the menu and and they have pictures/murals well they apparently discontinued it try explaining it to a cranky, hungry 2 year old third time was today we attempted to call ahead that's a joke they don't answer, we ordered 3 adult meals a kids meal and drinks well, fryer was \"broke\" so no fries and no Brussel sprouts, we asked for double burgers got singles and three of the drinks in fountain were out of syrup. No apology no compensation, I mean really your two key items are burgers and fries and you have none?? I get things break but this has to be the worst revenue store in the smash chain, with an in and out next to it and lines of cars wrapped around I would think this store would go out of there way to be on point and try harder."}
{"text":"Thomas was great and helpful he really is a delight to see !! !!!! I love coming here it's the best food"}
{"text":"Ordered a vanilla milkshake & smash fries. The fries weren't as awesome as I thought they would be. But the milkshake was! For $3.99 I felt I got my money's worth. This place isn't bad but not great either. I wouldn't mind getting another awesome milkshake from here again."}
{"text":"well the drive was worth it ....i got this crazy burger with fried egg on it....sounds weird...but it was amazing along with sweet potato fries it was a meal i had to go to the gym after...."}
{"text":"People are friendly. Nothing against them. However this was the worst burger and fries I have ever gotten. As my one cheat meal a week I wanted a burger this time. Figures I'd give this place a chance. I couldn't finish my burger it tasted like a oil soaked sponge and the veggie frys were soaked in grease. Never eating here again"}
{"text":"Create your own is awesome. Really good taste with fast service. This was my second visit and both times they were out of tea. I asked for them to refill the tea and the guy said he would. He never did. Besides that it was good but $30 for two people is too expensive."}
{"text":"A little more than I would like to spend on a burger in fries. LOL, but they gotta pay the bills."}
{"text":"We are in the area and really hungry before our drive home and decided to try this! We went for the jalapeno baja without guacamole because I don't like avocado. The burger was pretty good, and not because I was really hungry! The jalapenos gave it a nice kick. Got a side of the smash fries which were delicious!!! They are some of the best fries I've ever had and I'm always searching for good fries! Definitely trying this place again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a burger and fries to go while I was running some errands.  My poor little fries didn't stand a chance.  They were gone by the time I hit the third light.  My burger was saved until I got back to the hotel only because it looked a bit too messy to eat while driving otherwise it too would have been devoured.  Finally!  A restaurant that says that one of their food items is spicy and it really is!!  The Spicy Baja burger lives up to its name.  FRESH, not picked, jalapeños give it a nice kick.  All around great burger!"}
{"text":"The burger was small but good. The milkshake was only 3/4 filled in the cup and the haystack onion rings are terrible. Over all not that g"}
{"text":"For my first time ever eating at smashburger I must say that this establishment is amazing!!! Resturaunt style environment, very clean, well air conditioned for these hot Vegas summers.

Food came out pretty quick and made to order. I had the Sin City smashburger that was topped with a fried egg, smash sauce, Apple wood bacon, and lettuce with a side of sweet potato fries. Can you say yummm!! Very clean for a resturaunt, I was expecting a fast food - McDonald's type of environment lol. 

Now, on the price side.... This place is a bit on the rich side for my blood. I'm not a big fan of spending $11-$12 on a burger but it was somewhat worth it. Hey, what can I say, I ball on a budget. Overall its a good place for some good grub. They also serve beer :)"}
{"text":"A yearning for a chargrilled burger led me to find Smashburger.  Although  not charcoal grilled, I ordered \"The Classic\" which turned out to be  one of the tastiest burger I have had in a while.  Served on a tray with themed paper, it was adorned with fresh lettuce, tomato, Smash-sauce, pickles, cheese,  and red onions sliced really thin.  Really juicy and tasty.  The regular fries I ordered were thin, crispy with a sprinkling of salt.  My granddaughter had the Smash-fries which were garnished with rosemary, garlic and olive oil. These were incredible.  I had to steal some away from her.  The service is quick and friendly---Pay first, find your table and then they find you.  The only negative was a nasty wasp annoying us since we sat outside on such a beautiful day.  All in all it is a great value for a great meal.  We will be back...."}
{"text":"Smashburger is a good burger alternative to the In n Out next door. Think of it almost as a somewhat higher quality In n Out. They have a pretty extensive menu with chicken burgers and their regular burgers. Also, you can build your own burger. They also have a number of different sides and shakes.

I like to get the Sin City burger, which has onions, egg, smash sauce, and bacon. Top it off with a side of smash fries and you're set.

They are a little bit on the greasy and pricey side, but this place is a pretty solid burger joint."}
{"text":"Saw it, tried it. Spent $40 for a classic smash burger, a chicken avocado sandwich, two fries and two drinks. Not worth it. The burger was ok, but nothing special. I was told the chicken sandwich was just ok. In a nutshell I will not make an effort to eat at a smash burger again."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! I arrived 20 minutes late to pick up my order, which was already bagged, ready to go. The store manager noticed that the bag was sitting out for a while, asked if I had a minute, and had the cook redo my order JUST so that I could enjoy a warm, freshly cooked lunch. This was completely unsolicited! Thank you Smashburger for not only having burgers that hit the spot, but for your awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"We hit the new Smashburger off Randolph (behind Harris Teeter) on an \"off night\" once the grand opening crowds died down a little.  It's a nice spacious restaurant with ample parking behind it (who knew?).  It just sits at a very crowded traffic signal, and many times I've seen lines out the door.  Literally.  Out the door.  

Since there was no line, we were able to order pretty quickly at the counter and grab a booth to wait for our food to be delivered to us.  

Smashburger is a chain restaurant, yet its burgers (thankfully!) taste nothing like your typical fast food burger joints.  Yes, I'm calling you out McDonald's, Burger King, etc. with your pseudo-burgers.  The burgers are big, flavorful, and, yes, real.  I also like that they offer \"gourmet\" burger toppings, as I like some variety.  I opted for the Spicy Jalapeno Baja burger.  It wasn't super spicy (at least not for me), but it did have a kick, was juicy, and had lots and lots of flavor, both the toppings and the smashed burger itself.  The skinny fries have some great spices and herbs on them, too.  

The prices are a bit high for fast food, but I guess compared to the \"competitors,\" you get what you pay for, so it's worth it.   I've always thought Five Guys was pricey, too, but I think Smashburger has them beat in both taste and atmosphere (although no free peanuts!).  

Would we return?  Definitely.  As long as there's no line out the door."}
{"text":"Good food...my order came out quick! Shoestring fries...awesome! I had the Bluegrass burger...it was really good. 

I love the interior...very modern and clean. I will absolutely com back!"}
{"text":"The food is always great and I appreciated the 10% off! Thanks yelp! The cucumber and goat cheese smash chicken is my personal favorite, but I went with the sin city smashburger tonight! Very tasty. The manager even got us our drinks when she saw we were dealing with our kids! Top notch! I have had some poor customer service at this location in the past, but tonight was great! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This was the first time smash burger had a penicillin special bun. Wanted to get the gluten free bun,  well maybe it was but had added mold on top. After telling the server they exchanged it with a cold  bun and burger was cold by then.  Ask to reorder the whole sandwich,  without gluten bun and got the egg bun cold.  ON TOP of it, it came with an extra side of grease! The only reason why I choose Smashburger over five guys was that their burners weren't greasy, well they have jumped on the bandwagon.  For a 7 dollar burger I was really let down,  a mcdouble would have been a better meal than this. They really need to refocus on quality service instead of fast shoddy service."}
{"text":"I thought I'd deviate from the normal visit of In & Out Burger. The food is nothing to rave about. The burger was the typical burger and I was impressed with the smash fries."}
{"text":"You know what they say in the military: you can undo a million attaboys with one mistake. I've eaten Smashburger a dozen times this year - the burger comes in three sizes but I'm pretty sure \"big\" rhymes with \"regular\" in the kitchen. 
Today I'm in here with only two tables in front of me, it's five minutes after noon, and I'm eating my \"big\" burger and the fries they just dropped off at my table? COLD. Like  BACHELOR cold. Like \"help me mommy I dunno how to work the oven for my TV dinner\" cold. 
#%$& this, you think I can't pay ten bucks in the grocery store for some groceries and go home and make a bangin' WAY-better burger? Ima buy myself a little deep fryer for my kitchen, this is some ridiculous bull$%#¥ that I'm eating cold fries. 
Insult to injury: I do the \"survey\" and \"oops sorry I'm not the instant winner\" but I can write the validation code down and come back and present my receipt: for some free French fries! 
#suckit"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and what really has me coming back is the Truffle Mushroom Swiss burger.

I personally am not too wow'd by Smashburger but it is better than McDonalds. I might have to do an update later if I find something else I like on the menu."}
{"text":"Have to say I am super bummed. Guess I got spoiled at the queen Creek location so maybe my expectations were higher than they should have been. That said let me tell you the positives: place was relatively clean although we did need our table cleaned before we could sit down. The staff was welcoming, pleasant and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly - interesting that they delivered each dish when it was ready vs the whole order at once.  So with all the good so far what went wrong right?  Well it was the food. I ordered a create your own - as I always do - and while the burger was hot in temperature that was all the good I can share. The lettuce was limp and barely covered the bun, there was almost no sauce,  the pickles and jalapeños were very small - not like at the qc spot when you get big thick junks of crisp vegetables - and the burger could not have been greasier. Now I have a major problem with wet bread and not only did I go threw a bunch of napkins trying to dry off the bun and patty but there was actually a puddle in my plate before I could even finish. Had I ordered take out I wouldn't have had anything good to share about the experience. Oh and lastly the constant \"bugging\" if things can be taken away made me feel like I needed to hurry up and get out. Super bummed."}
{"text":"Well... it's a fast food burger joint after all, so don't expect much. The ambience is nice.

Price / taste ratio is about right - you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I must say I was extremely disappointed in my burger and what I thought was onion rings for $2.29...the burger was just ok...I got the regular size bacon cheeseburger which was $5.99 and the gentleman said it was a 1/3 lb which was more like 1/4...The bacon and burger were cooked great but the overall burger felt like a glorified McDonald's burger...I got the onion rings as my side only because the employee who took my order said they were his fav...They are just lightly battered onion straws you see as a burger topper all over the place...I will definitely not be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! I always order the goat cheese, spinach, cucumber with balsamic dressing burger and sweet potato fries. My daughter ordered the black bean and avocado burger and said it was surprisingly delicious. Can't wait to go back and try their malts."}
{"text":"It's only a matter of time before this location fails. It's obvious that this location is in need of an experienced, competent manager. This evening they were all out of sweet potato fries and cheddar cheese. There's no excuse for that, especially on a Friday night. My wife's order was made incorrectly, though she still enjoyed it. My food was good but my daughters' food was overcooked. Some of the sides were salted perfectly while others were over-salted. There's a consistency/quality issue with the food. The cashier wasn't very friendly but the food runner was quite nice. I am a Smashburger fan, just not a fan of this location. They have good product and the staff seems ok. They need stronger leadership."}
{"text":"They specialize in burgers and do a great job at it. The customer service is good and they have a few different kinds of drinks and different styles of French fries. I love the smash sauce. 9/29 it's terrible now"}
{"text":"They serve up a pretty good burger! 

First time here and had a very good impression upon entering I was greeted right away and was given great suggestions.  I ended up with a Sin City smash burger which consisted of the works as well as a fried egg.  The burger was delicious but they were a little skimpy on the fries, but great presentation and to complete my meal an IBC root beer float in an ice cold glass mug!"}
{"text":"$10 
For a basic burger. 
Worst lettuce wrap I've ever had. 
Not a bad place just needs some realization and a few pointers.
Service always seems slack.."}
{"text":"I have been to other locations but I'm by no means a regular. Well let's just say today I'm officially NOT a customer. 
Ordered a BBQ Cheddar Bacon ... it come out flat, not cut like I requested and no haystack fries. It absolutely looked like it was thrown together as an after thought and like they said \"eh, fuq it, it's a to-go order\". Well fuq that. I don't eat at Burger King but this might as well been from there - zero quality control and zero effort ..cept i paid 7$!!!

I asked them what was up with that and the guy nicely talked to me but at no point did he say sorry, we messed up and we'd like to make it up. Never did he say sorry. I got 2 ducking coupons from him. . Coupons. Yeah. Fuq that."}
{"text":"I shared a nice lunch with my husband on a Sunday afternoon.  We were actually on our way to Cafe Zupas but I forgot they were closed on Sundays.  Since Smashburger was next door, let's try it!

There was quite a line but it moved very quickly.  I think there were other people who forgot about the other place being closed.  The cashier was very friendly taking my order.  Quick, efficient and smiling!  Great!  We decided to split the Spicy Baja Chicken Sandwich with the Smashfries.  The sandwich was tasty!  It had fresh jalapeños, pepper jack cheese, guacamole and the regular 'fixins'.  It had a great spicy flavor that we really enjoy.  The chicken could have been a little thicker.  It was very thin but maybe that's just to cook it quicker.  I guess it's not just smashburger.....   it's smash'chicken' as well!

The Smashfries were shoestring fries with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  I honestly didn't taste much garlic but the rosemary really came out.  It was a different taste on my fries which I really liked!  Not too shabby Smashburger!

The dining area was busy but kept clean.  As people ate and left, there were employees coming out right away to wipe the tables and clear any dishes left.  That's always a plus to see.  

They had some really great looking shakes being prepared so I think I will stop in next time for just one of those!"}
{"text":"We were moving into our new house and needed to order something to pick up quickly. Smashburger it was. The online ordering system makes it super quick and easy. I did a create your own with blue cheese and grilled onions. My husband did the truffle Swiss. We also got haystack onions. Those are addicting. We will def go to this location again being that it's right by my new house. Yummy and fast!!"}
{"text":"We have visited several smash burgers both in Arizona and ohio so were happy when this one opened by our house. The burgers are always fresh and delicious as are the fries and onion straws. However the service is iffy. One time we went and it was friendly and efficient. Another time we went only one person was working the front and it took about 20 minutes to get a shake. I'm assuming someone must have called out sick."}
{"text":"Very clean, the food is fresh and amazing, and the staff members are young but very friendly. I am quite impressed with this location!"}
{"text":"Just okay. 

If you're staying at the Rio, it's conveniently located near the parking garage entrance and the escalators. 

It seems like other Smashburger's burgers taste better."}
{"text":"The Colorado burger is AMAZING!! My new fav for sure.   I've been to this location several times and other than a delay in getting a milkshake (which was delicious) the food is always fast and fresh!! The staff is friendly and there's a small patio that's nice in the spring."}
{"text":"Dear Smashburger....


oooooohhhhh mmmmmm. Let me count the ways how you are so sinfully good. 1) you serve alchohol. 2) your service was good 3) you brought my food to me 4)you got it right on the first try and I always order complicatedly. mmmmm and 5) the way that everything melted together in my mouth and exploded with flavor that made my eyes roll back took me by surprise. It's a BURGER. might as well have been having a filet mignon the way I was enjoying this burger. It was AMAZING. seriously, haven't had a better burger. The bun was a special bun, I think it was a potato bun I don't know, but it was AMAZING. the fries were delicious...... I miss you Smashburger and I wish you were here with me now.


Love,
C"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's new management or what, but this location has really stepped up their game. The quality of the food is spot on.  Every order is perfect and looks and tastes great."}
{"text":"I came here after a long day in the Phx Sun. It was a great way to finish the day before catching my plane. The service was quick and pleasant. The food tasted great. My burger was charbroiled to perfection and the meat to bun ratio was on point. I had the fries and they were fresh and not greasy. 

It completely hit the spot."}
{"text":"The burgers are great but the prices are a bit unreasonable. But if you don't mind spending more than $6 for a burger (which btw does not include fries or a drink) then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I love smash burger, that's the only reason I am giving a 3 star rating right now. I always get the build your own and smash fries. I love those fries so much they are my favorite. But I have been to this location a few times and this last time I went was the worst customer service I have experienced so far. I work in the food industry and I don't expect people to go above and beyond but this was just crap. The girl who works there with the red/orange hair and the glasses had to be doped up on something. I ordered my food online for pick up and I arrived and I saw one bag on the counter under the heat lamp and I assumed it was mine but I wasn't gonna just grab it because I wasn't sure. She was helping these two guys and I'm pretty sure they were flirting and she was taking her sweet time and she knew I was waiting I had to be standing there for at least 4 minutes and then my boyfriend said \"Is that to go order #79? We just want to get our food so it isn't sitting there getting cold.\" And she's all \"OHHHHH YEAH OKAAAAYYY\" kind of sounding like a bimbo like she had no idea what he said and he spoke to her in another language or something. And she grabs other people's food and walks away to put it on the tables. We just stood there shocked like... Is she on something? Could she not comprehend what we said? And then the manager came in a side door and I asked for my food in a displeased tone of voice because smash burger must have low standards and hire pretty much anybody even if they lack common sense. Anyways to end this review on a positive note the manager was nice even though he knew I was unhappy."}
{"text":"So when they get your order right, it is awesome! It is a 50/50chance that I get the right order. I usually go for three or four of us from work, and get it to go. At least half of the time, the order is wrong. Today they fogot an order of fries, and the Buffalo chicken sandwiches had no hot sauce on them. Another time three out of the four lunches were incorrect. But, when they are on, they are on- and the food is very good. Salds are huge, and the chicken sandwiches are very large as well. It is always jam packed, and it never seems like they have enough help. I keep going back only because we are addicted to the Buffalo chicken sandwich- crispy!"}
{"text":"This place went from being my favorite burger place to the bottom of the list. Simply because their quality went way down. Order fried pickles and there all stuck together in balls, burgers often are overlooked, and shorted on ranch... not cool! This place is expensive for what you get, and it should at least be good quality."}
{"text":"I just moved here recently from CO and have had smashburger before in denver. The Colorado burger with green chiles was the best thing ever! I didn't see it on the menu. though.
I tried the Strip burger instead and was slightly disappointed when it came out cold along with the Smash Fries. Everyone hates cold fries.... 
I love Smashburger and will probably stop at other locations around the area. I'm hoping the standards are better elsewhere. 
Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious food as usual, loved the coffee shake, and the staff here actually seemed even more perky and helpful than what I have become used to at SmashBurger.  
This was the first time I tried their regular fries, and they honestly weren't as good as their featured fries, so I guess the moral of that story is, if something is featured as a specialty, you should stick with it.  ;)
Good stuff."}
{"text":"Stopped by SmashBurger for a post-hike reward - it was worth it.  Tasty and fresh ingredients, friendly staff and a nice patio area to chill on with my big (and tuckered out) poodle.  
I like the option of building my own burger and found the three size options ample (and there were a lot of chicken sandwich options too, but if I'm going for a burger, a beef burger is where it's at ;).  I enjoyed the sweet potato fries which had a yummy rosemary flavor.  They were out of lime, which was a super-minor bummer, but otherwise, the staff was great and accommodating to everything we wanted.  
My bf and I split a shake for dessert (holy cow am I glad we split it!  Haagen Daaz - yikes) and that capped off the whole burger experience.  
Definitely was filling enough to be practically two meals and I had the mid-sized \"smash\" burger.  Salad for dinner that night! 
Smashburger was a nice burger treat."}
{"text":"It is smash burger.  I was with family and they wanted to try it. It is okay in my opinion."}
{"text":"We ate here last night because my better half wanted a burger.  I ordered the chicken sandwich with the red hot and bleu cheese.  My better half ordered just a plain burger.  The food was decent and the sweet potato fries and regular fries were good.  

The only thing that was strange was the small bun it bugged me.  The bun seem to be very small for the chicken sandwich.  I asked the staff what gives.  The staff said that what they have because of the min wage hike.  I was like okay.  Hopefully they will mention a option to upgrade the bun next time to a larger size."}
{"text":"Putting on my burger connoisseur hat right now as I write this.  Thank goodness this place is open late - I mean, what place wouldn't be if you're in Vegas!

So, this is located in the new NYC food court-type place right outside the Colosseum in Caesar's Palace.  If you know me, you know I love me a good burger!  I didn't eat before the Mariah Carey show so I was starved by 10pm.  Made a B-line straight for the Smashburger!

Hey, it's Vegas, everything is going to be expensive so I always find it amusing when people complain about the prices.  I ordered the original Smashburger, a fountain drink, and Smash fries and yes, it came out to almost $20.  The burger was not bad at all, it hit the spot.  I had to add mayo (condiments are located to the right by the drink fountain).  It wasn't bad at all, but I liken it to a glorified burger lovechild between McDonald's and Burger King and In-n-Out.  The Smash fries I was really looking forward to, truffle oil, Rosemary, garlic...but they were way too salty.  I usually scarf all my fries down before I even touch the burger but not this time.;

The service was not bad.  I got my entire meal before my mom got her plain cheese quesadilla that she ordered BEFORE me at a different location in the food court.  So I'd say their service could be considered fast compared to others.  Why \"Smash\"burger?  They smash the burgers fresh!

Hey, if you're craving a burger and have limited options because you're stuck with your gamble-holic mother in Caesar's palace and it's late, you choose Smashburger."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers

Best burgers ever 

The create your own is great

The fries are good and the burger is amazing"}
{"text":"I waited at register 5 min as multiple employees ignored me. I complained and me and my 13 year old son where rudely told to leave! Customer service at it's finest! I won't be recommending to amyone anytime soon"}
{"text":"Soggy sad looking smash chicken.   Burnt overly greasy fries.   Rude staff.  I won't be returning to this location.  Employees look miserable so that tells you how your food is going to turn out."}
{"text":"Being a self proclaimed burger junkie, I have to weigh in on where Smashburger fits into the valley burger scene.  First off, if your litmus test for a good burger is price, you probably shouldn't be rating burger joints.  Remember people, the only reason you expect to pay next to nothing for a burger is because McDowell's has trained you to believe that a great burger is cheap!

Good food costs so stick to the fast food chains if you are looking for a $3.99 value meal.

Now, for those of us serious about our burgers, Smashburger is definitely a place to put on your list of must visits.  I have only visited the University location so other SB's may have bigger dining areas, but the University location is sorely lacking in space.  Between the hassle of parking and finding a seat, you would be well advised to go before or after the ASU lunch hour.

That being said, the burgers are worth it.  Not sure if I buy into the whole \"smashing the patty on the grill\" makes a big difference, but I will say that one taste will tell you that the ingredients are fresh and the meat is real beef - not a frozen pre made patty.  There aren't many choices for toppings but the presence of a fried egg option and jalepeno's should keep most burger lovers happy.  The fries are ok and include Sweet Potato options but the burger is the star here.  The shakes are good too but this is clearly where the profit is being generated.  Service is good but they could use another register during lunch hour as the line extends outside of the restaurant during lunch.  Other than that minor hassle, there isn't any reason that you can't get your Smash on too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I's first experience. WHAT A JOKE!!!! I went there because I was craving onion rings. So I order haystack onions and he tells me they only have burger portions of the onions because they \"ran out\" earlier today??? How do you run out of something hours before closing with a grocery store next door!? Then I tried to order my burger rare, and he gives me some condescending banter about getting salmonella. Please don't educate me on food I'm not a child. Both my husbands burger and mine were burnt. For $1.50 I got avocado, which literally contained about a heaping tablespoon of overripe smashed avocado. The smash fries tasted like burger king twice cooked and then smothered in WAY too much rosemary. We will NEVER be going there again! Waste of $15! And we didn't even get drinks!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is delicious! I don't understand the review below because the employees are always super friendly and make great conversation with the guests. If there's ever a problem the managers fix it for me right away so that I can enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"Updated review because they changed their fries! Also, our order comes out wrong 70% of the time now."}
{"text":"Been here before and it's been good. Came here about a week ago, and man has it gone downhill. First off they got 3 orders wrong in a 30 minute window. THREE orders incorrect. Not including mine. I asked for avocado AND guacamole, and only got avocado, which one slice was half brown. That wasn't appetizing at all. Secondly, every table was dirty. There were 3 tables that were free but dirty. Told one of the employees and had me and my daughter (one year old) standing over 20 minutes before getting a table ready for us? The fries were over cooked. I order fried not chips. I wasn't happy at all this visit. I'm hoping it was a bad day. This place hasn't let me down like this before."}
{"text":"I think the Arizona breaded chicken is the best thing on the menu and I enjoy coming here and having it. My issue is my wife is a vegetarian and the veggie burger SUCKS! Prices were on the upper side after completing a full meal but I've seen higher at other places. Only if they could change their veggie burger I could be a long time customer. I would recommend eating here if you have not tried it."}
{"text":"First off let me say that the burgers in my opinion are better than most of the gourmet burger joints that have been popping up everywhere these days. Soooo good. But the service could use some work. I got the wrong order recently i called in and gave my receipt number etc. They told me the next time I come in mention my info and they would replace my order. Stand up right? Wrong. They completely denied their mistake. Pretty sad because the food is rock solid. Could be the best place around if it wasn't for management not owning a mistake. But again super good burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Terrible experience there recently. The service was rude, and like another reviewer wrote, it seemed like the employee was put out.

I've been here several times, and this is the first time I've had this happen, but I guarantee it's the last, because I won't be back.

The food is okay to pretty good, depending on what you order, but it is terribly overpriced.  It's okay to overcharge for a burger-but you at least smile when you do it."}
{"text":"While in the area and having some time to waste we decided to finally check out Smashburger.  It was pretty busy when we got there, which was good because it gave me time to figure out what I wanted while standing in line. Before I knew it I was at the cashier who was super friendly. 

I ordered the make your own chicken burger and shared an order of the smash fries (skinny fries)
I was very impressed with all the options you could choose from on the menu especially with the \"make your own\" items like spinach, jalapenos and multiple kinds of cheese are not the norm! 

We took a seat and were in anticipation to receive our meals.... A short while later a smiling woman came by and dropped off our orders and my first thought was \"Wow, these look so fresh!\" the spinach, red onion, tomato and jalapenos I had asked for looked and tasted freshly cut and prepared. The chicken patty itself was juicy and had great flavour. 
I truly enjoyed this burger experience and didn't think the food tasted like traditional \"fast food\" at all. 

The only thing I am not a fan of is the location -because I live in the far south ....but that won't stop us from going back!"}
{"text":"I love cheeseburgers and I love sweet potato fries so this was the perfect place for both.  The patty was smashed, hence the name.  The flavor was pretty good and I liked the eggy bun it came with.  The sweet potato fries were delicious although I think they put too much olive oil on top of them.

I liked how they brought our food to our table and the heavy duty wire baskets the food came in.

The decor was modern and nice.  The floors however were really greasy and a major turn-off.  Not sure we'll go here again."}
{"text":"One of the best kept burger secrets in this town. Sweet potato fries and a burger you will not soon forget."}
{"text":"One person in front of us and we waited in line for 10 minutes while the register was unattended.  We were not greeted with an apology, just an excuse that new people are being trained.  One employee stood talking to a customer for over 15 minutes instead of working.  Another employee just stood near the counter doing absolutely nothing.  We picked a table to sit at and had to wipe it down ourselves.  My daughter asked if there were forks and was met by the employee rolling her eyes at my daughter.  Our ketchup bottle was empty.  The fried pickles tasted like blocks of salt.  Horrible experience. Will not be back again."}
{"text":"Its Smashburger so the food is always great here. The food came out like order. The staff was friendly and they listened well.  They checked up on us often to make sure the food was good and if we needed anything.  Overall it was a nice dining experience for lunch."}
{"text":"Love the food.  My son devoured his burger so fast I'm not sure he even tasted it, lol.   Next time, I will get the dressing on the side.  Way too much was poured on my salad leaving the bottom looking like a bowl of soup but that was my fault.  I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side.  Will definitely come again.    

Don't let the name fool you.  They have salads, shakes/malts, chicken sandwiches,  grilled cheese, hot dogs, chicken nuggets.  Black bean burgers.  Definitely well rounded."}
{"text":"I had the Classic Burger with a few modifications. The burger looked pretty good but it tasted quite salty (maybe due to the amount of grease?). The sweet potato fries were ok, but weren't as crispy as others I've had before. 

Overall the place is clean and the food is served rather quickly. 
I might give them another try to see if the salty burger was a fluke."}
{"text":"Spent $30 on 2 burgers, fries and a shake. Received soggy, cold fries and a burger so salty I couldn't stomach more than a bite with a piece of lettuce so thin I could see through it. Huge disappointment as I've been excited to check this place out for a while. Won't be returning, unfortunately. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Okay I don't like to give bad reviews but they deserve it. First few experiences here were great. These last two-three visits have been awful and I will not be giving smash burger anymore visits regardless of how many free meal coupons they give out.

About a week ago a co worker and I decided to order online for our lunch break. They asked for a phone number and never called when our food was ready. When my co worker picked up our order it was COLD. I was irritated so I called immediately and asked why our order was cold and why they didn't call and remind us. The lady on the phone said they never call when orders are ready. Wtf. We work in a salon nearby and sometimes lose track of time due to a bunch of walkin clients. So of course we may forget what time it is and most places usually call to give you a reminder. She then offered us free meal coupons... Fast forward today. I ordered two burgers and a large order of smash fries, which I still had to pay for because the coupon only covered the burgers.
  Well come to find out after paying $3.26 for soda and fries, my SMASHfries ended up being regular fries. Whatever you do, don't come here because if you complain you'll get even worse service the next time. Too expensive and the staff doesn't care about the customers."}
{"text":"We got the Jalapeno BBQ Burger at the airport.  It tasted like if burger went to Mexico and came back.  It's spicy but not too juicy.  Like a fiesta in my mouth.  Lacks the BBQ sauce but it's tasty nevertheless.  Real jalapeno peppers was what made this burger.  The fries with rosemary garlic was good.  Overall not a bad airport meal."}
{"text":"First time there today. All the people working were very helpful & friendly. Burgers were really great, as were the fries. At least 4 people working there, including the chef, came to see that everything was up to par! Good work, guys! We'll be back! I have now been smashed!"}
{"text":"Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.  Overcooked tasteless burgers.  Dried out chicken breasts.  Soggy flavorless fries.  The only thing we had worth ordering was the Nutter Butter shake.  The shake wasn't enough to save it from the 1 star rating.  Might be the worst restaurant burger I have ever had."}
{"text":"Good burger and fries! Was excited to find a fast burger shop with gluten free options so close to home. Don't skip the shake- they're delicious ;)"}
{"text":"Bad night at SmashBurger! Their credit card machine is broken they are only taking cash, so we were willing to leave get cash and come back then we were told it's a 30 minute wait time and there is no ice for the ice machine...Omg where is corporate when you need them to step in/up WTF."}
{"text":"I had Smashburger the first time at La Jolla and loved the Mushroom and Swiss. I live in Cincinnati now and tried this location, and it was fantastic. 

The lady working the register on 04/07 around 6:00 p.m. Was awesome and made me want to come back. 

The food was really good, as I remembered. The only thing I dislike is there being no option for a meal. 

I ordered the Mushroom Swiss regular, a regular order of Smash Fries, and a water totaling just under $10. Not the cheapest meal but the burger is basically gourmet, especially with the white truffle mayo (which I passed on this time). 

I ate everything. Smash burger is not the place I can eat at everyday currently with my budget, but a great place to stop by on Fridays when the checks come in. 
 
4.5/5 93%"}
{"text":"I dont like to give out bad reviews, but im coming from the perspective of wanting something thats pretty simple to make. I wanted a protein style burger. I paid over $7 for some beef sitting on lettuce! C'mon guys. In-N-Out makes the damn thing for like $3, and it is at least made with some decency. Step it up"}
{"text":"I went in for dinner with my dad ... For ASHLEY!!! Since we came into the door she was such a sweet heart!!!!.. Very good with people!  You cant find someone like that now days in vegas....by the way my bacon chicken burger was delicious! THANK YOU!! I will definitely will be coming back..!! I highly recommend this location. :)"}
{"text":"We come to Phoenix once a year for USA baseball Tournament(s). This is our third  trip to the Avondale SmashBurger. While the burgers, the chicken sandwiches and the variety of fries are very good the service is outstanding. I have not been in SmashBurger Avondale when the staff has not been warm, friendly and cheerful and this is an over the counter place. That attitude makes a big difference to me and where I spend my money. Your food is brought to your table after ordering. They do not have traditional \"waiter\" service."}
{"text":"Sooooo good, my fav burger place in town hands down!!!! Service here is always great.. I like to come here even though its not the closest to my house. keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"One of the only burger places that offer gluten free buns! And goat cheese so I can enjoy burgers on my gluten and casein free diet!"}
{"text":"This is one one of my favorite burger joints! Yeah, I grew up on In-N-Out like my husband and then he took me here last year... Boy, did it change my religion! I still like my old go-to places, but this is one of the few places where both he and I have gone to different locations and have had both food/service consistently great. 

Burgers melt in your mouth and the smash fries are a must! Tossed in olive oil and rosemary... Nom non nom! I've paid $13 for a burger alone somewhere else and this one beats it out of the park. Though it's still pricey, it's worth every cent.

I love our Tempe Marketplace location the most. The staff is ridiculously helpful and sweet. They seem cheerful and not fake about it. You know? I just have too many good thoughts for Smash Burger to list, so I'm done lol"}
{"text":"Love smash burger! Great rosemary and garlic fries! Friendly and fast but oh so good!"}
{"text":"Good burger but overpriced. Cashier displayed negative attitude and wasn't very helpful."}
{"text":"We were referred by my parents and decided to give it a go. We were greeted warmly by Sebastian who kept it light and fun while still making great recommendations and being more then accommodating to any requests we had while adding ideas of his own to enhance our experience. I realized after I ordered that I forgot to ask for no onions so I asked the manager on duty who was working as the expeditor and he took care of it immediately. The food was fantastic, especially for the price range. I got the Bacon Cheeseburger (Big) and my wife got a Truffle Swiss that she added the onion strings to and they were both amazing. The burger is soft in texture but in the best way possible. I also got the Smash Fries and my wife got the Sweet Potato Fries. We got the Smash Sauce, Ranch, and BBQ sauces to try and they were all amazing. We also got a shake each. I got the Butterfinger and my wife got the Chocolate Oreo and they were so good. I am in the food industry and I was extremely impressed by Sebastian, the Manager on duty, and all the staff who made our experience so memorable. We will be back soon and often."}
{"text":"Great burgers when you want a quick bite. Fries were a bit soggy but it's fast food. The expectations aren't set too high when you're hungry and in a hurry."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice. Terrible both times. Both orders were \"to go\" and both were messes when I got home. Food was luke-warm (I live nearby) and a greasy mess (even the grilled chicken sandwich!). I can't believe this place has so many locations and isn't bankrupt. There are lots of good burger joints (in-n-out, shake shack, etc.) - do yourself a favor and choose a different one."}
{"text":"Greasy burgers and dried out chicken anyone? Don't get me wrong I like a nice greasy burger every now and then, but this place was just overdone. It reminded me of going to a friends house who bought the cheap beef loaded with fat and made a oversized hamburger just dripping with grease. 

The second time, I had the chicken burger and it was dry dry dry, no juice in this bird. I haven't been in the shop myself, only been given the food but they're going to have a harder time competing with the other burger shops all down lake mead blvd."}
{"text":"We stayed at the rio for three days and I'm
Sure we ate here like six times lol. The staff was great and the food was always perfect! They're open breakfast hours and have some good breakfast options. My son loved the new chicken tenders they had just added to the menu!"}
{"text":"You know the first time I came here there was some problems with my order, it took a while to eat cause they kept messing my order up, but when I finally ate. The food was delicious! I must of caught them on an off day, cause I've been going since then, and the service is great. They are very quick to bring your food, and they are really nice."}
{"text":"Bland bland bland! Overpriced garbage. I see what they were going for, but they failed terribly. If this is gourmet then I'm never eating out again. It's amazing that someone can screwup something as simple as a hamburger. I guess they put all their effort into coming up with a clever name."}
{"text":"The SmashBurger signage looks like a GameStop but trust me, they sell burgers here. 

Very trendy looking and I was scared that it might be like Delux (ack!) but this place is pretty awesome. REAL. GOOD. BURGERS. 

I had the Arizona Smash Burger: Chipotle bun, sauce, guac jalapenos and habanero cheese with a side of Smash fries (fries with olive oil and rosemary).

The burger was delicious. I enjoyed the spice but definitely could have used some hot sauce too. The hamburger reminds me of a good backyard bbq. The fries, eh- I could prob do without. However, I did get to taste some of my friend's onion rings (well, they aren't really rings, more like thinly sliced onions, battered and deep fried) and they were awesome. I would prob get that next time.

Not too long of a wait during lunch so definitely adding this place to the usual lunch mix."}
{"text":"Ummmm......one of the worst burgers I've had in quite some time.   Hey, if you like salty buttery oily burgers then this is for you.   I'll stick with fudruckers, blu burger, red robin or any fast food joint....hehe!    Want to try a great burger go to Firebirds."}
{"text":"I went to the Smashburger Yelp event a couple weeks ago and was pretty impressed with the food and have been raving about those SmashFries since. The burgers were flavorful, not overly greasy, and the fries were cooked to perfection. 

Unfortunately, that night gave an unrealistic expectation of what the chain really serves up- greasy burgers and old crunchy fries. The only thing that seemed to be as I remembered were the sweet potato fries. 

We ordered the large burgers, something I won't recommend as they come on the same size bun- the patty is the only thing that's larger which makes it flop over the side of the bun condiment-less. 

My burger was also served on a tray only half lined with paper, so I had straggling fries. The staff was kind enough the leave the expo ticket on my plate, too (yay fiber!). The tray liner was also soaked in grease, something that didn't happen on Yelp night- I double checked the photos. This is a shame since this location is a stone's throw away from Red Robin, In-n-Out and a couple other places. 

TIP: Wear a Yelp shirt for good food."}
{"text":"The go to, pour moi:
Kilt Lifter (In a frosty mug)
Bacon Cheese Burger (smashed of course)
Chocolate Malt, (in honor of the Ol man)

Not a bad burger, always popular.

Friday nights can be crowed.

FYI try to avoid week days. It appears the staff is not on their A Game. 15 to 30 for the food to arrive. Maybe I am just being picky.

Cheers mates

{"text":"So I've been here twice. First time I got the Truffle Mushroom Swiss and some Smashfries. To go. It was alright. Wasn't overwhelmed - I was hungry and it hit the spot. Next time I came with some coworkers. We were all excited because here was a new place pretty close to where we work and it could be high on our lunch rotation. But that idea came to a crashing halt when we got our food. This time I got the Spinach, Cucumber and Goat Cheese burger. I know. Sounds pretty metrosexual but I was curious. I also got the Haystack Onions. Well when I bit into the burger, I had to wonder if Bessie, the cow I was biting into, hadn't fallen in love with the salt lick and continously deep throated it for the rest of her days. Dang burger was salty as heck. The Haystack Onions were too. I would have let it slide if it were just me. My coworkers, however, said the same thing. It took the three of us to finish the haystack onions because I could not have more than just a bit of that oversalted mess. Service was pretty sucky too. The Einstein that brought the first burger took away the number on the table so the next guy that brought the rest of the burgers only knew to stop at our table because we flagged him down. Yeah yeah. The place is still \"new.\" So this is the moment - like in a game of Hearts when somebody drops the queen of spades or some card with hearts on it - breaking hearts, as they say. I'm dropping a turd in this circle jerk of a punchbowl with everybody dropping five stars all around. We ain't coming back. Sorry. Smashburger apparently isn't for everyone."}
{"text":"Lunch today with the lovely wife at Smashburger.  The service was good.  We both had burgers and we split onion rings (or whatever they call them) and fries.  I had the Smashburger fries and they were ok but could have been better.  The are seasoned and have olive oil on them which is ok but there was a bit much for my liking.  The burgers were good and we sat out side which was pretty nice.  We will be returning.  

The bill:   Two 1/3 pound burgers, one order of fries and onion rings and two sodas.  $19.00.

They also have a decent selection of bottled beers.  Almost forgot to mention that!"}
{"text":"This review may or may not have already posted but it did not finish from my end. I ordered a basic burger and added bacon, the bacon wasn't on the burger after paying extra for it even though the place had no orders in front or behind mine so it was simple, read the ticket and make. Mistakes happen, however the manager Jalissa was extremely rude when I asked for it to be fixed, and then she handed the cooks my old burger to simply add bacon too it not remake it and add the bacon as she should. Overall the food was ok, the management is aweful. As stated in other reviews specifically stating jalissa."}
{"text":"Moved to the city a few months ago, and being from a small town you always here about the fast food places you don't have. I tried this place for the first time a few weeks ago and didn't finish my meal. It was terrible, the taste, the appearance it was gross. I'm not sure if it was because I came later than \"normal\" dinner time or if it is always like this, but I don't think I want to give it a second try."}
{"text":"Love this place so glad they put onw by my house. They have awesome service and as far as the food... I really love the truffle mushroom ,swiss chicken sandwich and the fries are pretty dang good regular or sweet."}
{"text":"I'm a huge smashburger fan, but this location lacks customer service. I'm a picky eater (sorry not sorry) so I have a few items I don't want on my burger. The lady was in such a rush she screwed up both mine and my husband's order. Their set up is awkward as far as how you get back to the counter to handle any issues with your burger. It's almost as if you are blocked from doing so. Anyway, when my burger is made right I LOVE how smashburger does it. I just think this particular location could use some help. I highly recommend the smash fries - YUM!"}
{"text":"Smash Burger has the best burgers I have ever tasted! There is a good selection of burgers to choose from and every one I've tried has been fantastic!

I haven't been to the typical fast food burger places since I discovered Smash Burger.

A good value for the price as well."}
{"text":"So smashburgers in general aren't bad, however the service and fries at this location were horrible. First we stood in line for about 15 minutes before we ordered. They were 8 people ahead of us. It was painfully slow service. Then I ordered sweet potato fries and she heard \"French fries\" so that's what I got instead. The fries were awful. Over cooked. I got the bacon cheeseburger- really good and my husband got the $7 Oreo milk shake- really good as well. All food is overpriced. Unfortunately the lady who hands you your food was so rude and I thinks she may have been the manager. We sat and watched her hand customers their food, she never once smiled and was visible disgusted when someone would ask a question. She would just point and then turn around and walk away. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"So far at this location I have had good experiences. I have been coming to this location since it first opened. The Burgers are decent. I have nothing really to complain about. It's not the first place I think of when I am craving a burger but when I do come its really good. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Been to this location 2 times in the past month. The first time I went for dinner, they forgot the sides, and forgot toppings on my sandwich. I asked for smash fries and didn't get those either. When I asked to get it fixed, I was given nothing but attitude by the guy. The second time I went, I placed my order to go. However I waited 10 mins. just to place my order because the employees were too preoccupied talking and looking at what was going on in the back. (And I was the FIRST person in line.) I finally get my order taken and I wait and wait and wait. About 30 minutes pass and my food still isn't ready. Come to find out they skipped my order when I WAS the FIRST person in line. During my time waiting for my food I heard yelling and staff members yelling inappropriate noises and things coming from the back. When I get my food I order a chicken sandwich; I received a burger. When I ordered I got smash fries; I got regular, hard, stale fries. I waited too long to deal w anything else and left. I was too grossed out to even eat my food. I will no longer go to this location and possibly any other location. They ruined what I think about smash burger. Don't waste your time going here. I would give 0 stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"Oh Smashburger...where have you been all my life??? 

I would say these are the best burgers ever! So juicy and so delicious! The haystack onion rings and regular fries are great. The garlic rosemary fries are okay, just not my cup of tea. Shakes are delicious. I haven't tried it but they also serve alcohol here, you can't beat a burger and a drink! 

Now for the service. The dark haired girl at the register could use some lessons in delivery/communication. She came off super snotty. I don't think that was her intention, she is young so that may be the reason. There was a runner in the dining area named Alexis (I think) and she was AMAZING! She was super helpful and very friendly...you're going places Ms. Alexis, keep up the good work. 

Bottom Line: Super awesome burgers, check this place out for sure. Try one with an egg or with avacado, it makes the burger even better! Yummy! :)"}
{"text":"Well, service was GREAT, food was ok.
Fries were cold,  burgers came our super quick, cold bun, just warm burger, not hot...
And a little to red inside.
Could have gotten 5 stars with hot food.!
By the way, Jaz gave us GREAT service..and 2nd order of fries were hot..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's because my experience at the Hyde park Smashburger has been so magnificent every time, or what, but today at this location was just \"Ok\". Nothing special. The girl who greeted me was friendly enough, but then there was another girl fully uniformed in Smashburger attire sitting (semi-lying) in a booth talking across the restaurant to her co-worker (who was trying to actually work). Definitely NOT the experience I've ever gotten at the Hyde park location from staff members. 

And maybe it's cuz I got it to go, but my veggie frites were soggy (way over-oiled!) and the portion size was small. And they said they were making my food fresh but the food wasn't steaming hot like it should have been if that were the case.

I think next time I'll just stick to what I know, and go to Hyde Park's Smashburger, even if it is out of the way!"}
{"text":"Uh yuck.

Overcooked/mediocre burger, in my opinion, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I  also went for the sweet potato fries. I can honestly say these are the only sweet potato fries that I didn't want to eat. I am a bit of a sweet potato fry whore, so managing to turn me off to them means you really suck.

Honestly, I love burgers & sweet potato fries, but I never want to eat at this place again. How does a place with burger in its name serve such a lame burger?"}
{"text":"Meh, this place is just okay for me. I mean, it's another burger joint. 

I stopped in for lunch and ordered a black bean burger with cheese.  For me, the burger was just okay. It didn't have a good consistency and fell apart a little bit when I was eating it. I would have liked for it to hold up a little better - especially for the price. 

I did like that it arrived to the table hot, and that service from the moment we entered until the time we left was great! I'd give them another try to try one of the classic burgers and a side. 

Stay tuned."}
{"text":"What's the point of Smash and Dash if the order is always wrong, never ready, and nobody is tending the line? Thanks for the cold, expensive food."}
{"text":"For those who don't eat beef (like me), there's a good selection of chicken and even a vegetarian option.  That's unlike 5 Guys, whose vegetarian option is toppings on a bun (still pretty good, but still...).  Smashburger's Arizona chicken burger (grilled) is quite good -- flat and kinda smashed (which makes sense), quality chicken, well cooked, Habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and jalapeños on a spicy chipotle bun (I got mine without the jalapeños - I figured I might be feeling that the rest of the afternoon in the office).  Sweet potato fries are very good (though I do like the ones at Lenny's a bit more)."}
{"text":"First time here to get a quick burger and to change it up from my regular burger spots. Place was nice and service was ok. Burger came out quick and was hot and fresh. Taste was average and satisfied the burger need. Only had the original with cheese and thought almost $6 was a lot for it. Maybe I will be back."}
{"text":"Since moving to AZ a year ago, I have tried a lot of chains that are new to me. I reallly like Smashburger, but this location at 58th Ave & Thunderbird  has progressively gone down hill. Today, there was food on the floor as you walk into the restaurant, the bathrooms are filthy, the iced tea was water. I had an offer for a free entree, so stopped for lunch. Even with a free burger, it was $15. Too much for a burger, 2 small fries (really small) and 1 fountain drink and a glass of water with a tea bag waved at it. Never again. Too many places to get better food. For less. In a cleaner restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest smash burger I have been to. Also I thought they only have smash fries with the rosemary and garlic. Forgot to ask well I don't remember ever asking. They always ask me if I want them. Anyways also no trash can. Like someone took the trash out and forgot to put it back. And like I said dirty. Almost all the tables were dirty. No one wiping them down. Nothing. Wiped our own table down. Wtf not a good experience. Been to jack in the crack's on the west side nicer than this one. Cleaner. Not going back. Should've went to Raising Cain's"}
{"text":"Smashburger is pretty good. Having eaten here a few times before, the food is worth the drive- but it's a tad bit unsettling to walk in the door and see one of the servers with his pants down below his ass. I don't like staring as some dude's ass every time he decides to turn around. Especially not cool around my food.  Wonder what the health department would say..."}
{"text":"Staff is always great. Food is not. Smash fries pretty much have olive oil and only that on them. Rarely do I find rosemary in them. I've been to this location and about a dozen times and I always expect it to be better. The preparation of the food looks rushed and I usually have to put my burger together before I can eat it. I frequent other locations and don't have these same issues. I usually get the Arizona burger and it tastes great and my wife gets the avocado chicken and has no complaints either.  I will continue to come here because I love the Arizona burger and hope they will fix these issues."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, Food came out extremely fast and was even greeted by the owner and got into a long conversation. He was extremely polite and accommodating, exactly how every business owner should run a business, regardless of whether it's a franchise or not."}
{"text":"After raving to my family about Smashburger after the Yelp event I had to go back for another burger.

After reading so many bad Yelp reviews I decided to wait a little while to let them work the kinks out before I returned. One day while in the area running errands I decided to take my daughter to lunch for putting up with all of my running around.

Since it was one of my favorites from the Yelp event I had to go with the Truffle Mushroom Swiss burger. My daughter went with the Classic Smash burger and we shared a order of Smashfries. I got a drink and she got a Oreo Milkshake.

A few minutes later our food was on the table. Everything tasted just as good as it did from the Yelp event. My burger tasted delicious and was cooked perfectly and my daughter inhaled her burger as well. The fries were well seasoned and cooked perfectly as well. My daughter was nice enough to give me her left over shake that was in the mixing cup. Boy did it make me want to order my own. LOL! 

As soon as we were done with our meals a girl came over and took away our trays and asked if we needed anything else which was nice. That doesn't happen at Five Guy's, Wendy's, Burger King or anywhere else for that matter.

A little over $20 and we were out of there. I don't know why there are so many bad reviews but our meal and experience was perfect."}
{"text":"My second time eating at Smashburger with my G-Daughter. I discovered Smashburger offered Wheat-Free buns. The first time I ordered a salad. The Wheat-Free bun was delicious....in fact I doubt if anyone who didn't know it was Wheat-Free would guess. Plus the chicken was cooked to perfection, Avacado, tomato and lettuce was fresh. Service at ordering and wait staff are pleasant and attentive. Good prices topped off the experience."}
{"text":"The burgers are always great here but it's the staff that makes this place even better! Kristeey was very helpful and cheerful, always smiling :) The whole staff was amazing and the food was perfect. Best Smashburger location!"}
{"text":"I have never had Smash Burger before so I was hoping it would be great, but after today I don't think I'll ever give them a dime of my money! 
On the front store of the restaurant, it says they close at 9:30p, so me and my friends walked in about 8:58p or so and the doors were locked WITH customers inside. The customers inside were trying to get out but were locked in, & me and some other groups of people were locked out! The customers on the inside who were TRYING to get out were finally told how to unlock it(they had to do it THEMSELVES. the workers didn't even help), and the people who were waiting outside walked in (like you normally would to order food, right?). 
Some dude from the back yelled \"were closed!\" And I responded with \"it's barely 9:00\" and some shorter blonde dude stated they're closing early with no reason as to why. He was rude and honestly, we ended up going to In-N-Out :) I'll take my business elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"They carry gluten free buns and are super nice about changing gloves before handling my food. That alone makes me a fan. The burgers themselves are delicious. I got the truffle and mushroom burger with added onions. It was hot, fresh, and greasy in a pleasant way. The smash fries are so popular with my kids we have to order extras. They are crisp, salty and the rosemary really adds something. They're pretty quick to get the food out, too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger, fries & a drink for a little over $12! Way over priced for the portion sizes & taste. I came in on my lunch break & there was only 1 person in front of me in line, not busy at all. However it took them 20 MINUTES to get me my food! People that were coming in 10 minutes after me were told the food would take about 30 minutes to come out, but they never told the people that were still there waiting for their food! 

To top it all off, the girl bagging & handling the food was wearing NO GLOVES & texting on her phone in-between orders RIGHT IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS!!! This place is very poorly ran & obviously violating health code. Save your money & go to Five Guys or In n Out instead!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. I love trying new burger joints and I go out of my way to go back to Smashburger, all the time! The staff is friendly, the Smash Fries are amazing, and fresh ingredients on their customizable burgers are to die for. 
5 stars almost isn't enough, for me!"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ burger with onion straws and bacon, the Oreo shake and Smash fries (rosemary & olive oil) - all of which were delicious!! Three of us went and it was $30 for three burgers, 2 fountain drinks, 1 shake and 2 fries. Kind of pricey for a small burger joint, but if you're looking for something a step above In-N-Out and are willing to pay a few extra bucks it's worth it! The location is nice as it is right next to Harkins theatre in the Tempe Marketplace. I also liked that they served beer (in bottles and cans).  That is just a nice option for us grown ups and one you don't see very often out of a small burger joint.  

Price is why it lost a star and why I won't make this a regular place to eat. I could go to Red Robin and get all you can eat fries, and a much bigger burger for the same price."}
{"text":"Sin city smashburgerrrr... yum 
Love this place. Seems like its always busy so you might have to wait. I usually pick up because the tables are full. 
Veggie frites are awesome and the chocolate malts too."}
{"text":"The food is comparable to most real gourmet burger shops, not restaurants that call themselves gourmet burger shops.Their burgers are delicious, try one with an egg on top! I recommend eating at the shop, as the fries don't fair well on the trip home. I was pretty bummed out the first time when we got home and they were a hot mess. Rest assured, they are delicious when consumed at the venue. I also liked the basic chocolate shake, I didn't try any of their fancier offerings, but I may have to."}
{"text":"Greasy yet tasteless burgers. Toppings didnt help. Bacon was cardboard. Clothes smell like grease after entering. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Visited in the middle of June on a 111 degree day. Um, no AC! We had already ordered or else we would have left. The staff was friendly but it was stuffy and boiling hot with flies everywhere. We were told they had tried to tell corporate to fix it but had not heard back...?"}
{"text":"The food is great, but they could stand to have a few more salad options. Even a turkey burger would be nice."}
{"text":"As soon as we walk in the cashier said sorry no shakes attitude was kinda snarky.  Unlucky for us that's what we were looking forward to.  Got the drinks From the soda machine and noticed they didn't have any to go lids.  I asked if they had any lids and they said nope only the domed lids for the shakes which they couldn't make .  To top it off they fed my kids raw chicken strips.  Stay far far away.  Sad they used to be my favorite.

*update*
They did make us two free chicken strip meals but hopefully my daughter doesn't get sick"}
{"text":"I came here with friends and it wasn't extremely busy but somewhat, and it was a Sunday at 2. Took more than 30 minutes to get food, bathrooms were filthy, employees unfriendly. Possibly the worst restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Love this burger joint!"}
{"text":"I love Smashburger sooo much! Best burgers and fries in town. The malts are awesome. I go at least once a week."}
{"text":"Well I've been on a no carb kick for the last month so burgers are verboten right now.  Of course salted caramel shakes are not!  Seriously delicious.  The contrast of salt and caramel goodness set to vanilla ice cream made falling of the carb free wagon worth it.  If you dine in you not only get your shake but the extra that comes in the stainless steel container they make it in.  Hey go big or go home!  Next time I'm trying the burger because they seriously look too awesome not to.  Oh and the service was excellent as well.  Very friendly order takers and even brought our shakes to the table."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service here but 2 stars for the food.  Decided to dine in and ordered the classic Smashburger with an order of deep fried pickles.  Burger was average at best and lacked flavor.  Deep fried pickles were hot and fresh but too salty for me.  I've been here before for the salted caramel shake and will probably just stick to that since nothing else was that incredible.  The food was freshly prepared and the workers here are friendly and quick though."}
{"text":"That was a dang good burger (I had the sin city burger) and the garlic sweet potato fries were oh so good."}
{"text":"Given them three tries and they always suck. We got a coupon and on this occasion they salted the hell out of my girlfriends and my burger to the point they were inedible. This means there were repeat offenses of gross negligence with the salt shaker in my book. Smash burger, as a chain, ya gahbidge"}
{"text":"Totally BOTCHED an online order- called to contact to have it rectified, 3 separate times only to be told by a machine that the in restaurant customers are more important than me! I don't appreciate driving in rush hour, paying  for \"extras\" that are non existent, and then having zero opportunity to speak to someone to correct it. I will not visit this or any other smashburger again."}
{"text":"Good food, great fries, but too expensive. When I hear the name, SMASH Burger, I'm thinking huge burgers \"Hulk\" like. Ok, Maybe I was just super hungry. Nevertheless this was my first and last visit, nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"I wish that I had something exciting to report about SmashBurger but all I can say is that out to go experience was good, the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. To be honest it was nice not to have anything major to complain about. 

We ordered two of the \"create your own\" chicken sandwiches, fries and drinks to go. The order took about 10 minutes to be brought out to us. 

The chicken sandwiches ($6.99 just for one sandwich) were tasty, juicy and made almost perfectly. 
Fries were thin and of appropriate quantity. 

Good food but a bit pricey. I think I have been jaded by the inexpensiveness of dollar menu lunches. 

Oh, I found something to complain about. They now offer Nutter Butter shakes which is unfair to those of us that are at the beginning of bikini season."}
{"text":"This was a last minute splurge for me.
I was at the Fresh and Easy that shares a parking lot with Smashburger and decided to treat myself to one of the crispy chicken sandwiches.
I was in line behind a family of 6. They, somehow, managed to feed two adults and 4 kids for about $21.00.
I ordered a build your own chicken sandwich, fries and a nutter butter shake. With my chicken sandwich add ons (bacon, cheese...) fries and the over $4.00 nutter butter shake my meal was about $15.00. The food was good but not $15.00 worth of good. Luckily I had a guest card so my meal was covered.
The chicken sandwich was missing a topping but was tasty. It wasn't as crispy as previous sandwiches that I have purchased and was a little greasy but it was good. The fries were decent and they didn't OD me with so many that I would have to freeze the leftovers. The nutter butter shake speaks for itself. Its a great sweet treat with a little bit of a crunch to it.
The restaurant was clean and properly stocked with napkins, straws... My order was ready in about 5 minutes. The staff treated me well but I saw three of them making faces at another patron because he was upset about a mistake that had been made,  Other than that the experience was what you come to expect from Smashburger, high priced good food served by a friendly staff in a clean restaraunt."}
{"text":"Delicious. I love anyplace that allows me to CYO. I'm going to do it anyway! The menu choices are very good. Not complicated...pretty darn perfect! Smash fries, regular or sweet potato, yummmm. Everything is always seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"I admit, I'm still just a \"dude\" when it comes to eating out for lunch.  When I'm not eating pizza, I'm usually eating hamburgers. The Classic Smashburger is now one of my favorite fast food burgers, and their chocolate milkshake was very good.  There wasn't anything unique about the milkshake, just delicious.  Their sweet potato fries, however, were not crispy and therefore disappointing.  All in all, I was definitely impressed by my first visit to Smashburger, and will try it again soon!"}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of their burgers, since they're overpriced and the quality doesn't deliver BUT the milkshakes/malts are what bring me in every time. 
Join the smash club! You'll get $1/point to eventually redeem a free burger ;) 

If you ever order a milkshake/malt order FOR HERE, they'll give you'll the extras aside from your cup. 

Decided to treat myself after doing my last workout of 2016 and their fryers were broken....so anything fries want happening. Fresh fries, sweet potato, chicken stripes, onion stacks.....you get the picture.
Aside from that, Tammy visits are always great. Never too busy so you'll always find a spot and there'll occasionally be a worker making rounds to see how everything is going. 

It's tough to revisit the temptation to get a drink every time at the gym since it's literally in the same parking lot, but they have seasonal shakes!! 
I went with the chocolate Oreo and mom got the Belgian Cookie :) definitely would recommend both!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing burger.  Amazing Smash fries.  This place is better than In-and-Out or Five Guys."}
{"text":"I was hanging with some friends while visiting Vegas, and this joint is right by UNLV campus where we were at the time. We walked over, and on the advice of my friend I grabbed a 1/1lb monster of a BBQ bacon cheeseburger. The burger itself was delicious, I enjoyed it immensely but 1/2 was wayyyy too much for me. I also got an order of the sweet potato fries which were not bad, but not at all GOOD. The seasoning seemed....odd. I can't describe it any better unfortunately.  I was very pleased with my burger however, wit the friendly staff, and with the Cherry Coke option at the soda fountain."}
{"text":"Burgers are fresh and great quality ingredients. The fries with rosemary are delicious. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Smashburger for hosting the restaurant night for Sunnyslope High School Band. Great food for a great cause!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Try the Blue-cheese."}
{"text":"This location is great. Very clean interior with friendly staff. The ordering process isa  little overwhelming at first (SO many choices), but our food came out deliciously. Their burgers are SO juicy and delicious. I love their smash fries w/ rosemary - unique and scrumptious. We also tried their fried pickles for the first time and I was really impressed with how tasty those were as well (not as greasy as you might expect). Prices are a little high for a burger at a fast food-ish type place, but I think it's well worth it. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"OMG, what can I say.  You gotta try the Sin-City burger!!!!  So lucky to have this burger here cause you cannot find it anywhere else in their other out of town locations.  In fact each city has their own signature burger.  Thank you Sin city!!!!
I am just waiting for them to find a location to open up in Henderson so the drive won't be so far to get this!!!  HINT HINT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Smash burger was delicious. Better then I was expecting. I wouldn't say that it fills you up as much as I would like but I believe it's justified for the price. Worth trying in my opinion, I don't see anyone not enjoying it. Not messy like five guys either, although hard to say which one is better. 

Also, great environment, great staff and a clean restaurant. The mall it's located in is awesome as well. If your there at night there is a wonderful massive fire place in the center of the outdoor mall, it's nice to sit by. You could also stop by cold stone or catch a movie. Great center."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, bit pricy, but they are worth it. I would highly recommend their Truffle mushroom burger, nutter butter milk shake and veggie fries. 

The service is pretty good, usually they aren't that busy.  And restaurant is pretty clean. If u want a good fast food burger that's made fresh, then this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to this location and my 5th visit to the Smashburger chain. 
I have never been disappointed by the food or the staff. Friendly, helpful employees take your order,  deliver your food and clear your table - they don't seem to hover but are so attentive and friendly!!! I have ordered the Classic Smashburger with fries every time I have been because it is so delicious! I keep telling myself to try something else but this is the freshest, best burger I have had in so long I just have to have it when I go there. The fries are delicious and my daughter loves the chicken tenders! Finish your meal off with one of their delicious milkshakes! You won't be disappointed ! 
Great job!"}
{"text":"Man, I was really excited to give your shop another go. I was very impressed that someone came outside to see how our food was, you don't always see that at what we like to call a quick serve resto... I call this my \"thank you, baby jesus\" restaurant when my head is still in my hands from other restaurants that miss the mark. I had the Arizona burger, and it fell apart on me... I wanted to bust out the knife and fork... Then there was the smash fries, too, oh yeah... I love you guys, and yes, I am a fan for sure..."}
{"text":"Food was fast and good! The salad was amazing and HUGE!! Tristen was awesome and friendly!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and Loved the food....so this place was a WIN WIN.

Smashburger has been on my list of places to try from the menu and the concept it seems like a place I would really enjoy!

I wish they would have had a turkey burger...since those are my absolute favorites but instead I chose the Spicy Black Bean Burger. It's loaded with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes and chipotle mayo....I could have used some added jalapenos for an extra kick but the sandwich was still awesome! I love the fresh beans and veggie mix they used to make the patty and the the chipotle bun was heavenly! 

I added the smash fries with have oil and rosemary and they were a perfect pairing for the burger....everything came out HOT and fresh and I enjoyed every bite!

The experience overall was very welcoming and I loved the decor....I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We went to Smashburger for an early informal dinner. We got there around 5:30 on a Sunday night. The place was literally empty. We were the only people eating. By the time we left, there was a huge line at the counter waiting to order and about a third of the seats were filled. I had never been there before so I took some time to review the menu. I ordered the avocado club grilled chicken sandwich. It came on a multigrain bun. There were a few slices of avocado. It was a generous portion of lettuce and tomato. The bun was huge. And there was a fairly generous portion of grilled chicken. The combination was quite delish. The portion was huge. We also had an order of sweet potato fries. We like them crispy and that's just the way they came. Again quite delicious. Highly recommend this for an informal dinner or an informal lunch. I will be coming back for one or both."}
{"text":"Just ate their, food was really good. Better than your average burger, sweet potato fries were very yummy. Had the swiss & mushroom burger, my mom had the make it your way blue cheese burger, and she really liked it. Will definitely be going here again"}
{"text":"Best burger in a long time.  Shoulda got the smaller one, but I managed..."}
{"text":"Smashburger used to be so delicious. Like...mouthwatering-want to eat 3 times a week- tell all of your friends- DELICIOUS! Sadly, we've given this location 3 chances and all three times have been a let down. I will say the customer service is always consistent....Very friendly and good at what they do by treating customers well. The food has just gone down the hill."}
{"text":"Love their black bean burger. Absolutely delicious, and the toppings you can add are awesome. Stack it up, add some of the delicious sauces, chipotle bun (or whatever it's called), some XXX Vitamin Water...and smash away! LOL! No complaints, only compliments."}
{"text":"Food - 2
Service - 5

I really did not care for the food burger and fries. It wasn't horrible, but there are so many great burgers out there. So I'm not going to go on and on about the food because I was not impressed. 

The service here is excellent. Excellent. All of the staff is helpful and go above and beyond to ensure that you have a great experience. One employee was cleaning dirty tables and floors. The other employee that was bringing out our food would come by and check on diners and even offer to refill our drinks. You can't even get that at some sit down full service restaurants. 

This is a great family, kid and group friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and burgers are always consistent.  Not many food options in the area.  Love how the burgers are all made fresh to order! They have the best sweet potato fries in the area.

And for dessert don't pass on the shakes ... You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Brand new location across the street from Fiesta Mall and it was fantastic! Food was perfect! I had the Buffalo and Blue Burger and buffalo style  fries....just amazing! Finished with a signature milkshake -perfect end to a perfect meal! Employees  went above and beyond to make sure everything  was ok!  We were only customers as the location just opened and definitely need to get the word out. Don't forget to sign up for their loyalty program and Smash Burger Club. Two different programs with awesome deals and coupons. We'll definitely be back to take advantage of both deals and try other food choices! Great to have this new location!"}
{"text":"I really like the classic smash.. very juicy and flavorful.  I ordered the sweet potato fries. They were good as well.  My husband ordered the haystack onions. These were very greasy and not very good.  My kiddos loved their burgers and fries.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Sun City burger: like hangover awesomeness! Fried egg, bacon, cheese , fried onions, onions on an egg bun. Cure what ails ya!

I love how every state  has a different burger!"}
{"text":"Still drooling over yesterday's meal from Smashburger--excellent food!  I'm not usually one for burger joints, so I was pleased with the menu given it has so many choices.  There are plenty of salads and every burger can be made with chicken.  I had the baja grilled chicken sandwich and it was perfect!  Incredibly juicy and flavorful chicken, with avocados, jalapenos and spicy Baja sauce.  The sandwiches are huge, so while a little more expensive than some other seemingly similar restaurants, you definitely get your money's worth.  

I almost always get sweet potato fries when available, but the owner taking my order suggested the smashfries.  I was hesitant to deviate--I mean, you can never go wrong with sweet potato fries!--but oh...my...gawd.  The smashfries alone are worth the visit.  They're tossed in rosemary, garlic and olive oil.  They're so incredible I'm pretty sure I bared my teeth and growled at the poor bus boy who offered to take my tray when I still had three fries left.....um, sorry about that, bud.

The place is popular and pretty busy at lunch, with limited seating.  But the service is friendly and fast and the food lives up to the hype!"}
{"text":"I'm new to this zip code.  Got a coupon for Smashburger via the USPS, thought I'd give it a go.

I get there about 11:30 AM.  There are about five people in line in front of me.  ONLY ONE GUY servicing the line.  I think the people at the register were discussing the finer points of the Mona Lisa?  After about three or so minutes I left.  Sheesh.  Really?

I have not eaten _anywhere_ where the food is good enough to stand in line for 15 minutes to order a hangerber.  

Nope.  Never.  Nada.  Nichts.  Zip.  Zero.  Never.  Nothing.

There should have been AT LEAST TWO people taking orders at that time of day, and if people want to discuss the Mona Lisa?  

----- NO SOUP FOR YOU! -----

I get the impression from other reviews that this place has been around for a few years?  Really?  And they STILL make people stand in line for ten or fifteen minutes to order a hangerber?  

I'll not likely return.  Life is too short to spend 15 minutes standing on my haunches to order a freakin' hangerber.

I have a life to live.  No time for this kind of nonsense."}
{"text":"Good food, like their salads, just need to remember to ask for less dressing next time."}
{"text":"Finally a burger with flavor . Ordered bacon avocado burger which was great plus staff is friendly and attentive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Russell is the best. Very friendly and has good recommendations. Try his own shake he came up with: salted caramel, peanut butter and oreo. Delicious! Burgers are great. Try the truffle mushroom with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Total four stars!!! The staff and service is mediocre, but their burgers are relentlessly delicious!!! You should definitely try the smash fries, which have rosemary garlic on them. My cheeseburger was delicious! Will totes come back!!"}
{"text":"Not only is the presentation of the food great, the food is phenomenal. I came to grab some lunch with a friend before class and it was delicious! We loved it. It's not very expensive too! Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"It's clean and workers are very friendly. Also their spinach, goat cheese salad is amazing. Their swiss and mushroom burger with truffle sauce is also delicious, but my favorite item on their menu is their nutter butter milk shake. Its 1000 calorie deliciousness, that can be enjoyed on a heavy workout day. Just JK, but try out this milk shake. Its delicious."}
{"text":"love this place
better than MCD duh..
better than BK haha...duh...
better than 5 Guys :)
better than Red Robin, slightly...we like good ol'Robin

My guy & I both have the AZ and the chili fries (when we're feelin naughty)

love it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I ordered the chicken avocado club, almost entirely based on the 2nd picture posted here.  Unfortunately, I hardly got any avocado like in the picture.  Otherwise, the burger was great.  The sauce was so good! It had amazing flavor and a generous portion of chicken.  Fries were also wonderful.  I will definitely come back to Smashburger and try other menu options.  Next time I hope to get some avocado on the chicken avocado club!"}
{"text":"After a healthy lunch and breakfast and a walking tour of downtown Fremont Experience, there was only one thing on my mind....

I. must.  have.  fries.

So I stopped into Smashburger to just get fries.  Before I knew it, the Mushroom Swiss was on the way, too.  How does that happen?  These are great burgers and I love the seasoning.  It is very satisfying and you can get the burger customized to your taste.

So after I order, I proceed to my seat to wait for my meal.  I managed to spill my entire purse in between the booth and the wall next to the booth.  Everything went down that crevice.  Oh how embarrassing.  I managed to pick up most of it, but still needed to get to some things in the crevice.  Ally, my server noticed what was going on, came over and pulled the entire table out, got a broom and pulled out what was remaining.  She looked into it and saw there was nothing else in there.  One of the guys from the kitchen came out too to help and they both were immediately assisting me.  Then we put the table back and got back to normalcy.  By the time that scene was over, my food had arrived. 

Another wonderful burger.  I really should try something other than mushroom swiss but its my go to and I love how it tastes.  Oh and there were those fries I was craving.  Sorry, I didn't leave you any.

Thank you so much to Ally for being so humble and service minded to help me with gathering my things.  Because of Ally, I am giving Smashburger a five star!"}
{"text":"So I hate to have to do this BUT I had a complaint when the service was less than ideal, we had to wait over 45 min for our food, the restaurant was in a chaos, and NO ONE but the single server was around. This was a 6-7wks ago. I gave them an opinion online. I was emailed by the district manager and was told they would call. I got the call from the STORE manager and we offer a replacement on my whole meal. So a few weeks back I returned ALLL the way out there again to try and get the meal I had originally ordered. I've ate at the UNLV location and had NO issues. I made the mistake of ordering it To Go. The fist indication was my milkshake was barley half way full of a med size cup. She said they ran out of cookies and cream??? So dont offer an alternative?? Then I get home and I had ordered a sandwich type that is ONLY available in the chicken sandwich. Yet mine had BEEF. The sandwishes were WRONG Again and Im pretty sure this time it was on purpose. I wont be back EVER."}
{"text":"We split a bacon cheeseburger, spinach salad, IBC root beer in a frosty cold mug and garlic rosemary fries. It was all good. 

They cut their shoot ring fries right here!!! And even though I'm NOT a fan of rosemary, I must admit these people struck a great balance between potato, garlic, salt and rosemary. I would order them again.

The burger was good (even though it was well done) and we opted for the Udis gluten free bun and bacon OTS (on the side) next time I'd get the classic with cheese...tomato and lettuce would have been a big help since we all know gluten free bread is always a bit dry.

The spinach and goat cheese salad w/ grilled chicken was awesome!!! The cheese was fantastic &flavorful. Here's what came in the salad: fresh spinach, diced balsamic tomatoes, raisins, dried cranberries, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, red onion and cucumber. We asked for dressing on the side, but the balsamic from the tomatoes was plenty! The chicken was perfectly cooked through and still moist! A+.

Enjoy and have a great day!"}
{"text":"I have ben to thisnsmash burger many times in the last 4 years and I have got to say they seem to be a decent burger joint... I dislike the fact that they are super greasy, and sometimes seem to fall apart, but that's hit or miss.. More often then not, lately they've seemed undercooked and falling apart... The ones that aren't falling apart are good, and a lot less messy.. The grease is always there.. The fries are nothing to write home about, smash fries or otherwise... I go here occasionally when I had a hankering for a particular burger off what I call the \"old secret menu\" which is called a sin city smash burger (the used to serve it there a long time ago, and still do in vegas, I gather every state has there own special smash burger)... Sin city smash is the best bang for your buck in my opinion.. I never went for a shake there because the heartache is already steep ebough from laying 8-9$ for a burger.. Def not a bad place, just way too expensive, too crowded, and sometimes inconsistent.. I think other compsrable places like five guys is way more consistant, and gracious with the amount of fries you give and choices for free toppings. idk, just my opinion tho."}
{"text":"I had Smashburger for the first time a couple of days ago and I was not impressed. My burger was way too greasy. The smashfries were good but they were greasy as well. I'm not expecting for my burger to be dry but there is a major difference between juicy and greasy and they crossed over into the land of the grease. And they were heavy handed with the salt. Unless I want my sodium intake for the week in 1 day, I would suggest that they move away from the salt.

They are similar to Five Guys in that they have no combos but they have more options. I can see what the appeal is and maybe the cook was having a bad day but between the grease and the salt I will not be going back unless I have a death wish."}
{"text":"Today I picked up smash burger on my way home from the behavioral center. I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and wasn't feeling too great. Autumn took my order and she was extremely nice to me. I wish I  had cash to tip her. She really made my day. I walked out thinking \"wow. She was so nice\""}
{"text":"The service was very friendly, but on two different occasions, it took over 20 minutes to receive our food.  We really didn't receive an explanation, or even any consideration (like a free milkshake, or coupons for our next visit) for it.  There are way too many quick casual options in this part of town to not at least make an attempt at customer service.  Also, if you are watching your sodium intake, I wouldn't recommend this place.  It's almost as if their salt shaker has no lid on it."}
{"text":"Burgers are fantastic! Chicken is great as well. 

They have plenty of choice/options to pile on, from the basics to a fried egg.

My only complaint - is the fries are okay/good - not great. But, it is not a deal buster. I love the onion strings so problem solved for me.

Kids were happy here too."}
{"text":"Good burger.  Friendly service.  Can't ask for more in a burger place.  The eating area anf restrooms were clean.  It also smelled clean."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about these burgers. After giving Five Guys a chance I'll never go back to Five Guys. The difference in taste and ingredients is ten times better.  And I believe Smash is cheaper!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I ordered the bbq bacon cheddar burger and there was barely any sauce or onion strings on it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Had the lightly fried chicken sandwich and poutin. It was delicious. The chicken sandwich was light but hardy and the poutin was thin fries with the normal poutin topping. Not heavy at all and hit the spot. Really great lunch and love that everything is made to order and fresh.

Would definetly go back again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Smash burger is popular for their hamburger. It's refreshing and tasty. 

I ordered the classic hamburger and Baja spicy burger with garlic fries. 

The server brings it out to you on a metal tray opened. You just have to top it with ketchup, close up your burger and enjoy the deliciousness of it. 

I was a bit disappointed when I received the fries. It was seasoned. So the serve took it and came back with the fries all oily with a little bit of garlic powder on that. It looked nasty. All I saw was how much oil and whatever that was she poured on that of it. that's why I gave it a 4 star."}
{"text":"Overpriced.!.!.! Especially since you have to order in a \"fast-food\" line.  The food is sub-standard with no vegetarian option.  I spent so much taking my family here we could have gone to a GOOD restaurant."}
{"text":"Called today, November 4, 2016 at about 4:40pm and tried ordering for take-out. The guy who answered said he was too busy to take orders, and I was told to order through their website. I told him that I couldn't order through the website because I was driving. He suggested to call back later. 

I have NEVER called a place to order take-out and was told to call back later. If they can't handle taking orders through the telephone, I could only imagine how they handle making the food. This is poor business management, and this place does not deserve my money. 

Don't just take it from me; there's been a lot of negative reviews about this place."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff I've ever encountered in a Smashburger. I only ordered a burger and drink. The burger was delivered steaming hot, juicy, and delicious promptly to my table!"}
{"text":"Ok! I have tried TIME AND TIME again to give this place chances, but it seems like EVERY TIME I eat at this location my order is ALWAYS wrong!!! Whether it's burnt to shit or they just don't get my order right, I don't understand. I continue to go back cause it's the only one close to me and I continue to give chances but my goodness, it's insanely frustrating to order some food that you've been craving and it's all wrong. Wouldn't really recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Came here for FAST food but I unfortunately got the inattentive staff. One person at a time came and went while I waited for my food. No one else was at the restaurant. Finally after 5 or 6 customers I asked where my food was and found out it was sitting there the whole time! At one point there were three people out front clowning around while I was sitting at the table in front of the cashier and no one thought to check on the order of the guy that's been waiting? Cmon. 

Burger was good. Tried a shake for the first time and it was so-so. Definitely thumbs down for the inexcusably bad service and soggy fries."}
{"text":"I got really excited about this place when I went to the website and looked at the menu. They market themselves as a very different and cool little burger place. My boyfriend and I drove all the way across the city to try it because we had a coupon and honestly...there are quite a few pros and cons. The pros are that the burgers are very good. I was very happy with my California club burger. It was tasty and I finished the whole thing with no regrets. The smash fries are also great! Like there's nothing wrong with the food at all. But the cons...well, they say they have beer and they don't. I don't like false advertising. It's more like a fast food joint. There were lots of employees running around seemingly doing nothing. A lot of them seemed to know nothing when I asked questions. But they were all very kind and patient, to be fair. I think this is a newer location and they may still be working out the kinks. Please try it, because the food is very good. I'd love to come back when they've been around a while and have worked everything out!"}
{"text":"The first impression of this place upon walking in was a really clean restaurant with a nice digital menu system, along with a blonde girl at the front counter who obviously hates her job.  

We sat outside and soon had our burgers delivered.  I have been to several locations and this was by far the worst.   My wife had a black bean burger with 3 tiny avocado slices which we were charged 1.5 for.  She also had a very dry fried egg on top, also for a 1.5 surcharge.  I had a bacon BBQ burger which was marginally more presentable but very dry.  The sweet potato fries were disgustingly dripping with grease.  We chose not to eat them.  Even with a BOGO coupon, I still felt ripped off and will never be back to this or any of the franchises again.  Go to in n out!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Town! The staff is always nice right when I walk in they scream hello and it's just nice seeing the energy they have! The food is amazing! So many different choices and all good! Love the new buffalo fries! Wow just go here!"}
{"text":"The burger was good. I had a burger with mustard, onion, tomato and lettuce. It was cooked well. It wasn't out of this world or anything. My hubby had the sin city burger he said it was super good. We had 2 kids meals, a sin city burger, a reg burger, a chicken burger 2 fries and 3 drinks.. 40 dollars later it was just average all around. I wouldn't seek it out on my own but if I was hungry and it was close I would eat here."}
{"text":"Burger, fries, soda, with tax = $9.66

Order at register, take a plastic sign to table and wait 10 minutes or longer for the food to be delivered. (for dine-in)
Plastic cup is provided you cannot carry out, so you can only drink it in the store.
Food served in rigid steel wire rectangular baskets with paper liner. Rough edges are uncomfortable on the wrists. 
Thin thin fries are tedious to eat and not very flavor-full.

Music is loud, forget intimate conversation or a peaceful meal.

Burgers are slightly above average. I suggest Culver's as a substitute for better fries and a paper cup you can take home.

This business is designed to appeal to teenagers ONLY, not grown-ups. If you are over age 20 stay away, you won't like it. If you like smashed burgers try Culver's, it's essentially the same burger patty after cooking.

Upscale? Sure! (As long as your definition of 'up-scale' includes Taco Bell) This place is nothing more than just another fast food chain burger joint appealing to teenagers."}
{"text":"Place was ok. Went in for lunch today before it started getting busy. The girl at the front just stared at us as we looked at the menu. No hi... nothing. We ordered, sat down, and waited for our food. 

I had the mushroom truffle burger and my husband had the beef bacon avocado burger with the garlic fries. My burger was so juicy and flavorful but I'm not sure as to why it was SO salty :( I've eaten this burger before at other locations and I had never had such a salty burger, BOOOO"}
{"text":"This is my second time trying Smashburger. Only a different location this time. I ordered their new Crispy Buffalo and Blue cheese chicken burger. What a huge disappointment. The chicken patty, while juicy, was over cooked. The check chicken was a golden rust instead of golden brown. One would think ordering a buffalo chicken sandwich that they would dredge the check chicken in sauce. That was not the case. The breaded piece of meat (which had very little flavor other then oil flavor) was lightly drizzled with buffalo sauce. The blue cheese was plentiful but with the lack of sauce the cheese over powered the whole thing. No spice whatsoever.  The one good thing about this chicken burger though was the tomatoes slices and lettuce were fresh. I give them one star for that. 

I also ordered the new buffalo fries.  First off shoe string fries? Really? They have no substance to them. Horrible move on the chains part. The \"buffalo\" seasoning didn't taste anything like buffalo. It had an off taste very much like their normal fries (which my husband had) .

I will give this chain one more chance in the far future but I will make sure to try the cheeseburgers and not the chicken."}
{"text":"When I called to put in a To-Go Order the lady asked me to hold on for one minute. Ok. No problem. She didnt mute the line and I could hear everything. I figured she'd get to me as soon as she finished with her current customer. Nope. I hear 4 different customers place orders. I hang up. 

I was on my way home so I just stopped in instead. I made my order. Food came out fairly quickly. I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Burger (which was excellent), a custom burger with ketchup and mustard (which they put so little on it couldnt even be tasted), smashfries (where were hard and crispy, overcooked maybe), and fried pickles. Didnt care for the pickles one bit. I was very disappointed due to all the reviews raving about them. 

I'll be back when I want a burger, but I wont be going out of my way for this place. There are several other places in the vicinity that do burgers, so I'll be giving them a try before I come back here."}
{"text":"In line for over ten minutes with one cashier. Finally, order food and wait 20 more minutes. The food runner dropped our fries and picked them up, scooped them back into container. My husband said, no... we don't want those fries. The cook, flipping burgers, literally and angrily said to my husband, \"that's bullshit!\"  

If there was a manager here, they should be replaced. The counter was left unattended for five minutes while the line was to the door. The customers at the end of the line kept leaving. We were stuck in the front of the line. As a front of the line customer, we spent over 30 minutes in there!

Awful. Go anywhere else!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this Smashburger is going through some stuff right now but the whole place feels underwhelming. Staff is lackluster at best, and the food is eh. My burger was okay and my boyfriend liked his, but the buns looked like 1/2 the size of the patty.

The thing that really got me are the onion \"rings\". I got onion straws for 4.99. I can go to a Red Robin and get that for free. Tell your kitchen to check what they sent out because it's a little ridiculous we paid 4.99 for that. You can take a look at the picture and tell me if those are onion straws or not.

I don't see any comments from your location on any of the reviews so I'm going to assume you guys don't read these but if you ever start to care about your jobs hopefully you'll implement some changes to the food and staff."}
{"text":"Signature is Calgary reg burger. Fried onions, beef patties, lectture, tomato, bacon.  Smash fries is sweet potato fries. Liked it very much."}
{"text":"Becarefull!! I heard this place is very dirty in the back!!!!!!!
People get food poising a lot"}
{"text":"Never assume that all gourmet burger places are going to somewhat resemble the Burgatory. Therefore this review maybe slightly bias.  
Smash Fries- which were ok, but the Rosemary was a little strong. The more I ate them the less I wanted to eat them.

Spinach, Blue Cheese, Cucumber Burger- the burger was pretty good.  It was juicy and the toppings were fresh. My favorite part was the bun...nice and crispy!!!

Strawberry Milkshake- I did not like it at all.  I was told the use real ice cream.  Well the ice cream must be old or sitting around because I kept getting ice chips ( freezer burn) throughout my shake.  In addition, it taste more like vanilla with traces of strawberries.  My mom tried it and didn't even know it was strawberry. Very disappointed.

Service- people seemed friendly and good came fast.

Overall I didn't enjoy it enough to want to come back.  If a friend wanted to go, I would still go."}
{"text":"I'm a bit upset at the fact that I paid a certain amount of money to make my own burger to suit my craving, but yet when I unwrap it I find it wasn't even close to what I ordered!!! 

So happy I spent almost $9 on a burger I ended up throwing away. Thank You Smash Burger at Centennial Center. I will surely remember to drive all the way to Five Guys next time!"}
{"text":"Smashburger being within walking distance from my work is pure temptation. Just this past week I met some friends here for a quick bite. 
I ended up ordering the 1/3 pound classic smashburger with haystack onions as an add-on. I had to go with the smash fries, and am really glad I did. The smashfries are tossed with olive oil, rosemary, garlic and \"other herbs.\" Hmmm what are those other herbs? I would travel the world to find out what- that's how good they are. Almost as good as the fries at Fez :-)

To top it off, the manager checked in on our table multiple times to bring us back any condiments, ask us what we thought about the burgers, and to see if we needed anything else. Loved  the service!

Thanks for coming to the Valley Smashburger. We heart you!"}
{"text":"My mushroom swiss with light mayo came to me after everyone else in my group was half done. The mushrooms were not sauteed and there was nasty globs of mayo. Fail!  They offered to replace it, but seriously... get it right the first time. All I could think was the kid in back spitting on my food or something nasty.  Boo!"}
{"text":"been wanting to try this pace for awhile and finally did and no regrets. i just the smash burger and smash fries and i smashed the #$$%^% outta that burger into my stomach!"}
{"text":"My wife and kids like Smashburger but I find it a little to greasy. Its a good atmosphere and fun."}
{"text":"Pretty neat concept especially the serving local craft beer! Burgers were cooked perfect really loved the fries with the rosemary and garlic ,super good fried pickles that aren't on the menu you have to ask for them, plus I got married there!!!"}
{"text":"The good
Food Is Amazing!

Younger guy taking our order actually listened to my 8 yo when he wanted to order his food! I appreciate this as many adults ignore kids...he also asked him what he wanted for his side's. He gets a gold star for being a good person!

The bad
As we are a large family (6 of us) my mom and I went to try it just us...we loved it. Delish!
So a few days later we bring the whole family. thats with 3 kids. We ordered. We sat...we waited...and waited...and then they come out with 1 order at a time...starting with the adults...so i have 3 kids...hungry...with one of them being a 2 yo...and here are the adults with food and not them.

I may go back without the kids...we will see...but I don't think I will be in a rush. We like to all eat together...and if your going to bring it out separately. Bring the kids 1st!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for a long time now. The burgers are really good, the place is always clean, and the manager, Lauren Johnson, is so helpful! If you're in the Metrocenter area and are wondering where to go, this place never disappoints me."}
{"text":"I went with someone else who had a half off coupon. When we went in, it was not busy yet, and I saw employees hanging out, and unclean tables, but figured they hadn't gotten to it. So I didn't think much of it. Well when we left those same tables and the bathrooms were all dirty, and it was starting to get busy, so Im pretty sure the place staid dirty until they closed.

When it comes to the food, since I am Vegetarian, I got the Black Bean Burger, which was ok, but was poorly made and kept falling apart on me, which is annoying. Now what keeps me from giving the place a 2 or 1 is two different things.

The 1st is Sweet potato fries, they were DELICIOUS, and the 2nd was the deep fried PICKLES. I was scared when I saw them on the menu, but ordered them out of pure fat curiosity. This time curiosity didn't kill the cat, instead it made its ass jiggle for a week. My FAT HEART almost exploded when I tried them

In conclusion, I will come back, but only for the SWEET POTATO FRIES and the DEEP FRIED PICKLES, and I will get them to go, and pick up aBoca burger from Fat Burger instead."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment at this location. I got the deluxe burgers and they were small for like 7.50. I got three deluxe burgers that came to 23.00 and they were small. Go to Burger king and get a double whopper. You wont be dissatisfied. Make your money smash burger. I wont be back. Thanks."}
{"text":"This location has great food and the staff is excellent. Tried the Arizona
Burger.....which has Habaneros in it, you can't order a burger here without
A fried egg on top.....The burger was awesome, the habaneros are not
Overpowering just right with the avocado. I would Highly recommend
This location.....Enjoy"}
{"text":"Smashburger? How about sad burger. Disappointed doesn't begin to explain this burger experience. Lettuce? A small wilted piece of mess. Grilled onions? Practically nonexistent except for the 2 strings you see in the picture.  Tomato? Don't even get me started. The burger itself? Salty and a bit dry. All I can say is...It's a sad day when you have to doctor up a burger you spent your hard earned money on.  Once but never twice. Done."}
{"text":"Stopped by the fast food court at the Caesar's Palace for a late night bite. Options were limited so we choose Smashburger. 

I ordered the Classic Smashburger with smash fries. I have to say unequivocally this is the BEST fast food burger I've had so far. The meat was juicy, well seasoned with good fixings and great egg bun. The fries are seasoned with rosemary and are REALLY, REALY good!

Highly recommended for a good quick bite."}
{"text":"Food: Build your own Burger w/ gluten free bun, pepper jack cheese, tomato, onion, lettuce, bacon, smash sauce, ketchup, pickles, jalapeño - yeah I think I overloaded it ... And an Arizona burger. Both were lacking in sauce so I added some ketchup to mine but wish I had more smash sauce. Also, the smash fries (tasted a little freezer burnt or stale in my opinion) and a half strawberry-half vanilla shake... That was not full and I think he just put half the flavoring in. 

*** the bacon (that I paid $1.50 extra for) was left off my burger --- instantly 2 stars from 3!! ***

Service: very patient with me while deciding - there was only one person in line behind us but when we were leaving, the line grew. There were only two people working behind the counter at noon on a Sunday - so two people to take orders, make shakes, deliver food... Not sure if that is the norm but also the girl taking the orders was new and not super helpful (couldn't even tell me what the smash sauce was)

This was my first time at smash burger and not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Apparently they have no care for their to-go customers. Ordered a salad that looked delicious on the menu and brought it home to find a half empty bowl with a pathetic amount of everything. Absolutely not worth it. Can get a salad for $8 better literally ANYWHERE else. Even after adding the dressing and shaking it up it looked MORE pathetic. Pictures are how I opened it and after dressing. Not a single bite taken. Waist of money and still hungry after."}
{"text":"Went to Smash Burger with a friend a few weeks ago, it was the first time for me as I just moved to Las Vegas. It was really good. I got I believe the classic burger with Italian fries..didn't care for the fries.. to thin for my taste. My friend got a burger that looked like it had egg in it, looked good, she also ordered carrots with green beans which she shared with me...I love that you're able to get some veggies and they were very good.
 For my Cali peeps Smash Burger is like The Habit in a way."}
{"text":"Sigh...I wanted to LOVE this place, I mean really love it. Kind of like how a child loves their blanket. That I want to hug you all day and all night kind of love. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. It was just MEH and that made me sad. 

We dined on a Saturday night at 7pm. What the heck were we thinking. The place was packed and there was NO place to sit. Our food came out but because we had no place to sit they had to put our food back in the window. I was not happy about that. 

Once again my children were not very adventurous with their burgers. They played it safe and went for a Build Your Own ( Yawn).  My husband had the Carolina Burger which came on a Pretzel Bun. What? Is that a Southern thing? For me personally it's more like a Philly thing. My husband liked the burger but the bun was definitely a strange choice. Smashburger, if you want to rock my world with your Carolina Chili burger, throw the burger, slaw and chili on a biscuit! 

I had the Chicken Club and let me tell you the chicken was so thin I could almost see right through it. Because the chicken was so thin the taste was lost and I felt like I was eating more of a BLT than a Chicken Club. I also had the Smash Fries which were fries with olive oil, rosemary and garlic. They were good but they were GREASY because the fries were a thin cut.

We surrendered our table quickly and bolted. If I go back it will be for maybe an early lunch or an early dinner so that way I don't feel so rushed."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and the rosemary fries are unique. The service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I've been a long time 5 guys fan, and my experience at this smashburger have confirmed that I probably shouldn't go anywhere else. Got a burger and a chicken sandwich, the burger was salty enough to push your blood pressure into 4 digits. It was inedible so I gave it to the trash can for dinner. Who salts a hamburger? Really? The chicken sandwich was a little better but also on the salty side. The fries were mediocre but can't even compare to 5 guys, as anyone who's ever been there knows. I rarely eat fast food and burgers even less often, but for sure will never come back to this location. Maybe they should take Salty McSaltster out of the kitchen and stick him on a register so he can't mess with the food. It was seriously gross."}
{"text":"The burgers are really great and the management staff is awesome. There was an issue with my order after I had already left (take out) I called and they quickly pulled my information and took corrective action. The staff is friendly and the building itself is very clean and inviting. Really enjoy everything about it!"}
{"text":"Let me start this out by saying the place has potential. I showed up 10 mins before they closed, although their was a couple infront of me the food.... usually i give places a second chance. I know workers wanted to go home but.... I'll leave it like that until my second go around"}
{"text":"Went at lunch time today when it was busy and the order came out correct in a timely manner. The quality of the burgers is amazing for the cost. I strongly suggest getting the fried pickles or smash fries. The smash fries are shoe string fries tossed in rosemary, olive oil, and garlic."}
{"text":"For what you pay in this restaurant I expected way bigger burgers. Instead I got a burger that was smaller than McDonald's and way more expensive. Go to Five Guys if you want to pay this amount and get what you pay for!! Ridiculous. I will never go back. 35 dollars for 2 burgers two side salads and two tater tot orders. We didn't get drinks, everything is a la carte and we still paid 35!! Ripoff indeed."}
{"text":"I ordered the classic smash burger with bacon, smash fries and sweet potato smash fries.

The burger was flavorful, had a nice char on the outside and tender on the inside, and was cooked as ordered (medium well), which i appreciated. As for the fries, both were tossed with rosemary, olive oil & garlic - YUM!

The only thing I didn't like was my butterfinger shake, which tasted nothing like a butterfinger - it was a watery, vanilla milkshake with a few pieces of butterfinger mixed-in - LAME!"}
{"text":"Their bacon avocado cheeseburger is GOOD! AND HUGE! My husband and I shared one and we were really full afterwards. And trust me - if you knew us, you'd understand how big of a feat that really is! Their sweet potato fries are good, too.

Their customer service is en pointe, too! We were greeted 3 times in there by each person we saw. I love when back-of-house staff takes the time to greet patrons. They also gave us a free soda, so that was cool!"}
{"text":"Went there last weekend but the exhaust fan was shot so was turned away however was offered two $5 coupons for our next visit for my gf & myself. Went back today & LOVED the food their. Some of the best sweet potato fries you can get. BBQ bacon cheeseburger was delicious. Even the bun tasted great & had flavor. Will definately be going back there very soon."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the milkshakes are what keep me going back!!!!  The customer service seems to be getting worse every time I go there, which is the reasoning for the three.  Last time I was in there I literally stood in front of the cashier staring at her for about a minute and half while I waited for her to finish telling a story to her friend before taking my order."}
{"text":"My husband and I headed out yesterday to enjoy this amazing burger PALACE!!!! We were a little worried because it was lunch time and we were dreading waiting too long to wrap our mouths around their delicious creations. I myself was worried that service and the food would suffer during their quest to hurry and get customers taken care off. Boy was I WRONG.... not only did the lovely Nicole greet us with a beautiful smile and welcoming disposition but I also noticed Gerald (shift leader) taking and delivering orders and Ryan (manager) getting down in the trenches and smashing some burgers. Not only did they handle the afternoon rush without breaking a sweat.... they did it without compromising their great customer service attitudes and the food was still AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. GREAT JOB GUYS!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever at Smashburger and this is now on our go-to list.  I had the Spicey jalapeño Baja burger.  It was so, so good!  The chipotle bun was fresh, soft, and had a great flavor, but it didn't overpower any other item.  All of the toppings were fresh and flavorful.  There were two of us eating and we shared one order of fries and it was just the right amount.  They serve shoestring fries that taste like they are cut fresh and they weren't greasy at all.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Ordered a Colorado burger with Onion strings. Disgusting in every way. Half full grease covered container of soggy fried onions. The burger was a disgusting mess of raw jalapenos and a glob of mayo on a tiny bun that was saturated in grease and mayo. Absolutely inedible, I had to throw it away. Total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"First off - good burger & the BEST fries (smashfries.)

We stood in line for a very long time.  It took 5 minutes before the first person in line moved through.  I was hoping she was just a difficult customer, but the next person took even longer.  The one and only gal working the register was making the shakes - so that was a real problem.  Meanwhile, the person running food was just standing there - she couldn't have run over and helped? One employee was walking around - not sure what he was even doing because the tables were all dirty.  I got a napkin and cleaned off a table for myself.  Seems like they could have used their people better.  And the guy in the kitchen yelled something - not sure what it was, but sounded angry.  All the employees were not very friendly - until we were leaving.  

On the upside, the food came out faster than I expected given the wait in line, and the guy who was wandering around was pleasant and helpful as we were leaving - getting a to-go box, busing the table and such.  

Good thing this is located in Desert Ridge where you will get a line of people no matter how poorly you treat them.  I would never drive to this location."}
{"text":"All I can say is that in my 5 visits to Smashburger, they have never ONCE got our order right (and theres only 2 or 3 of us!)

The food is EXTREMELY over priced. A burger, fries, and drink will run you $11. 

Their fries are not good. And while their burgers are tasty, theyre just too small. 

5 times was one too many. Will not be giving my money to this business anymore."}
{"text":"Great burger chain that presents a flattened crispy edged burger with avocado as a great substitute for cheese that tastes great, or build your own.  Reasonably priced with lots of choices available."}
{"text":"kudos on great service and cleanliness. giving 3 stars due to underwhelming flavor of the burger.  got the az burger and added a fried egg, was expecting lots of flavor but the meat patty itself was not seasoned at all and the fried egg was overcooked so the yoke was dry and didn't give that lil extra i was expecting. the sweet potato fries were great! I would come back and try something else, maybe a chicken sandwich next time."}
{"text":"If I could give this place fewer than 1 star, I would. I don't normally pop on places to do reviews, but this place is so disappointing, it merits it. I've gone here multiple times in the past year, trying to give this place the benefit of the doubt. Nothing changes. Poor customer service (as in, rudeness). Items left out of the order on multiple occasions. Today I was given a plain burger with a teaspoon of blue cheese and a sprinkle of hot sauce as my buffalo burger. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I've been to smash burger now twice. Once for a burger, smash fries and a milkshake. Once for a chicken Cobb salad and fried pickles to go.

The fries were cold and soggy when I ate in, the pickles lukewarm and soggy when I took out. I live .03 miles from here and was early for my order. Not sure if it's a fryer problem or what. Burger wasn't very warm either when I ate in and tables were all messy/not kept clean. I gave it a shot twice and won't be back."}
{"text":"Burgers were decent but I ordered large meet it looked no bigger then my wife's reg sized one paid 23$ for some sorry looking burgers fries were very greasy all I can say is this is my first n last smash burger"}
{"text":"Was about to go to in n out, wanted to try something new. Great staff, good food!!
Hope to come back soon"}
{"text":"The staff here was really friendly and the burgers we had were great. Smash fries were awesome and flavorful as well. I just wish their sandwiches were a little bigger!"}
{"text":"Getting in is easy but getting out is a major cluster.  If you are dining in it's easier to park closer to Harris Teeter and walk across the lot than use Smash's little lot and fight for the light when you leave.

Burgers are good and come in regular or \"big\" sizes.  The classic smash is tasty.  Fries come in plain or \"smash\" seasoned.  The veggie fries are not my thing, just taste like half-cooked greasy carrots and string beans.

The organization inside is bewildering.  You're forced to enter one way and exit another which really doesn't help anything.  If there isn't an expediter at the pickup window, which is apparently often, it's like fighting through a pool of piranhas to get your food when it's called.  

The kitchen is not great at special requests like \"hold the onions\" and \"no cheese\" so it's better to order something simpler and add on special items you want.

But all in all not bad food and I would brave it again to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Just walking in the front door, the sidewalk is black with grease being tracked out.  Inside, the lights above the tables are dirty - lint hanging.  French fries on the floor and carpet and partition tops could use a cleaning.  Cobwebs on the walls.  Yuck.  Could not find one clean table and when I asked to have one cleaned, the water left on the table was unbearable.  I cleaned the table with a few napkins.  Burger was okay but with 2 of us dining on 2 burgers, 1 onion ring and a couple of iced teas for $22, I wasn't impressed at all.  Cooks behind the swinging door with window drinking as they are cooking (is that allowed?).  Seems teenagers are running the store and doing a poor job of it.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the BEST burger in town. My wife loves the sweet potato fries and the buffalo burger is a slice of heaven. We went tonight and the crew here is outstanding. I want to say thank you to one member in particular.   Sebastien was the hardest working man I have seen in awhile. He was everywhere !  Took our order, brought the food and bussed the tables.  When he was not helping customers he was cleaning everything he could get his hands on!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Not only are Smashburger the best at making great burgers, but they are very competitive in pricing.  Here in Henderson, they are located near a Five Guys and an In and Out.  We still choose them every time.  The Mushroom Burger is one of the best and so is the Barbecue.  The Manager was great and fun to talk with.  Very nice crew.  I enjoy every aspect of my meals when I eat there."}
{"text":"I have been putting off this review because I keep thinking \"It will be better next time\". It never is. The young lady who takes the order is great. She's friendly and prompt. Unfortunately it's all downhill from there. The kitchen staff and the to-go staff are very unprofessional and often rude. Yes, I know this is not fine dining. On two occasions they have been throwing food back and forth through the window that separates the kitchen from the dining room. 

The accuracy is ALWAYS a problem. I have never had an order that did not have something wrong with it. Something is ALWAYS wrong, or forgotten. The receipt and attached ticket are accurate, so...the kitchen just can't follow directions.

It's unfortunate because I love Smashburger, but definitely not this one. Go next door to one of the establishments that can give you what you ask for and be reasonably professional."}
{"text":"Not only can you get a burger- but they also offer grilled or crispy chicken! My husband is definitely not a \"fast food\" diner- but he enjoyed his crispy chicken sandwich- well seasoned tasty and fresh! I had the BBQ Bacon cheddar burger- cooked perfect and all the condiments were right! Very clean- great pleasant staff! The may be stealing my patronage away from In and out burger- right across the street!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"other than smashing their burgers they do something else special. I mean they must to make the meat that tasty and full of flavors. It's not common to find burgers you could eat just plain but I swear you could do that with theirs.

The skinny fries are yummy to. But if your a pickle fan they have fried pickle slices with buttermilk ranch to dip in. 

I have been coming to this location since they opened and I have yet to be disappointed by the service. They are fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Their fries are good, and so are the burgers. The burgers are big and juicy, and you can customize them to your liking."}
{"text":"Always love this location. Good service and the burgers are always nicely made. Try the big classic smash with bacon and fresh jalapeño."}
{"text":"Yummy! Much better than fast food fare. Don't you dare leave without an order of Sweet Potato Smashfries. OMG. Delish! 

It doesn't hurt that GiGi's Cupcakes is two doors down. Somebody grab the burgers while someone else nabs the dessert.

Some things work out perfectly!"}
{"text":"What a bad experience this was for a first visit.. the cashier was not friendly at all she made me feel like I was ruining her day.. I stated this was my first visit to the change and all she could do is ask for my name ..so to the little red head that works there I will not be back to ruin you day.. never again.. you only get one chance to get a new customer and you messed that up.. good bye"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! We ran into this place while shopping and decided to get some burgers. I ordered a spicy Baja burger, I love spicy so this seamed perfect. I guess I was right because I loved it. This isn't a fine dining burger joint but it was a great drive by spot. Fun burgers to choose from, delish milk shakes and fries... I'm down for that ANYDAY. 
It's family friendly for dinner. The staff was pretty young, didn't care much about the customer experience. Don't get me wrong they were nice but nothing that stood out as fantastic. 
The bathrooms were clean, so that a plus. 
We will absolutely go back here, it was a nice night out without spending a fortune. I can't wait to try another burger.... until next time Smashburger. We will see you soon :)"}
{"text":"I really wish I lived closer to Smashburger, well my taste buds wish we lived closer, my waistline is happy to have some distance. 

I have yet to try the actual burger but I am in love with the chicken sandwich. I like it when places pound the chicken out to make it a nice even piece and that happens here. In doing so, it makes the sandwich look huge, something else I like! 

The fries were good, both regular and the Smash fries but I find myself craving the onion strings which are served in a huge portion that would be enough to share amongst the table, though I loved them so much I find myself wanting to smack the hands away of my hungry tablemates. 

I don't really know what else to say other than go give it a try. It's nothing fancy but you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"Best value for the dollar, as far as burgers go on the west side of Vegas.  It's not glamorous, so don't go for the dining room atmosphere.  It's a solid burger with all the rights flavors and fixins'.  

Extremely reasonable add-ons (bacon, egg, avocado, etc.), mostly for $1.00.  Compare that to a $10+ kids' meal at Bachi Burger, and this place is great value & delicious flavor.  Win/win."}
{"text":"Arizona burger, fries and a nutter butter shake. Always good food and friendly staff. Great for a quick bite or groups."}
{"text":"I have been craving burgers lately so I decided to try SmashBurger for the first time. I am definitely not coming back! 

The food presentation seemed legit when the servers brought our food to the table, but their burgers and fries were drenched in grease. Didn't even want to finish my food, and my table was filled with napkins from all that disgusting grease. 

Service was alright. Janelle took our order & was a tad bit rude. She didn't greet us; but kept interrupting me as I was putting in my order by constantly saying \"for here or to go\". I obviously couldn't hear her because she made no effort to speak up. Daniel was nice enough to come around our table with a smile, as he was cleaning up & asked how the food was & for us to enjoy the rest of our day."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for my food, there was only about 5 people in front of me, got my money back after  asking 3 times, bad service, the girl were touching food, money and picking up ketchup packages from the floor with the same gloves, cooks are slow, cashier rude and apparently have heating problems. Go somewhere else, there's plenty of option in the same area."}
{"text":"Just got a turkey burger to go,and it was like a cook dumped a pile of salt in it. Horrible! Who in the heck wants to drive 4 miles to take it back????!!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what the heck SmashBurger was until it came to LV. Of course I tried it cuz it was a new place to me.

I've been here about 5 times now and its always a battle between the SinCity and the Mushroom Swiss burger. Both are good and equally oily.  ((drum roll)) ...and the SinCity burger wins!! Why? Because it has a fried egg in it!  They have a pretty simple menu, nothing confusing about it.  Food always came fast.  

In quicker words, its like half fast food, half restaurant.  You order and wait in line like a fast food restaurant, then you sit down and wait til a food runner brings the food out to your table.  Similar to Sizzlers.  Off topic but, I miss Sizzlers."}
{"text":"First time was the last time. It wasn't so bad. But, after eating there, my Wife says to me, \"Would you ever come back here?\" Answer was a definitive no! Hence, the 2 star rating. Burger was really greasy, sweet potato fries were... Merhhhh... Onion rings (Haystacks) were very thin and, just... Mehhhh. I also don't like this new trend of fast food restaurants pretending to be gourmet dining, with no service. It's another do it yourself deal, and for 24 bucks for two, I want a waiter or waitress, thanks very much. One & done, Smashburger. See ya!"}
{"text":"I just went to smash burger for the first time and I'm completely disappointed.. I order an Oreo milkshake for over $4 and the dude behind the counter keeps half of it in his own cup! Not cool.. After that display of total disrespect, I won't be back"}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant right at noon and there was a line but it went quickly and we were able to find a booth.  A drawback of the location is that the parking lot is very small and there are 4-5 restaurants in this small place so parking is always a problem.  My wife had the 'classic' and she loved it and my spinach, cucumber, goat cheese was very good as well.  Interestingly, they gave you a plastic glass for the fountain drinks rather than a paper one so not sure if that was to save money from people doing a refill before leaving or being a little 'classier' by having an actual glass (even though plastic).  I was very disappointed with the haystack onion rings as they were so frail that when you tried to dip in the sauce that accompanied the dish, they simply fell apart so wasnt sure if they were just breaking or were there actual onion pieces in the coating.  And I felt they were skimpy with the amount given as well.  So, the two stars off was for the parking and the scant amount of onions in the haystack but the burgers were very good.  I also did like the three different teas offered for drinks."}
{"text":"Yay, I'm a fan!

I loved this place. It's clean, not crowded, affordable, and they cook up some darn good burgers.

I had the mushroom swiss burger, regular size, and the sweet potato 'smash' fries. The 'smash' fries meant the olive oil was tossed with olive and rosemary. And i love that combination. The fries were great. Crispy, a bit greasy, and had generous amounts of rosemary sprinklings. The burger was even better. I loved the patty. It was thin, but it was good. You could tell the meat was fresh, and that's the best you can do to any buger patty. The bun itself was an egg bun I think, and it was amazing. Warm, slightly sweet, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Mmm.

The decor of the place was clean and friendly. It was not trying to be something it was not, and it wasn't trying too hard. Sitting at one of their tables, enjoying my burger, I couldn't help smiling.

The service was good too. I got up halfway during my meal to get some chipotle sauce for my fries, and one of the guys working there offered to bring it to my table. Very helpful.

I thoroughly loved the Smashburger experience. It's great when you want a good fancy burger in a nice comfortable setting but don't want to go to a bar. I will surely be back."}
{"text":"The BF and I had our first introduction to tastiness on yesterday. Read the reviews, so we knew we had to try the Smash fries and milkshakes. Milkshakes were smooth, creamy and natural tasting. Hit the spot and the rosemary, garlic and olive oil added a gourmet taste to the potato and sweet potato Smash fries. All that flavor and they were only $1.99!  Bf tried the Black Bean burger and I tried a Big Smash. He enjoyed the Black Bean burger and I learned that I will be getting the \" baby\" size burger for future visits. Lol. We were pleased with the freshness of the food, genuinely cool customer service and reasonable prices. We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"If you like salt I suggest you get the haystacks.. they are extreamly salty. The bugers are good but the last time I was there my bun was stale. I would rather go to 5 guys for a burger."}
{"text":"This is by far, the best burger I have had in Las Vegas!  I love Smashburger and this is the best location that I've tried!  The staff is very courteous and the food is delicious!  The restaurant is kept very clean and I love the outdoor seating.  The only reason that I gave it four stars is there is room for improvement.  Two words - Peanut Butter!!!  The Sin City Burger is almost perfect, but a while back I was traveling and found a place that had a burger with egg and peanut butter and it was AMAZING!!  Offer PB on the Sin City and POW!  5-stars!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service. I went at lunchtime, so I expected it to be busy. I ended up having to wait 40 minutes for a burger and fries. That was way too long for me to wait for a fast food place. I even saw one woman leave without getting her food she had waited so long. Try ordering ahead of time maybe? 

My food was cold after waiting that long, but it was actually very good. I had the goat cheese spinach cucumber burger and smash fries with a chocolate shake. Very good. Maybe I will try Smashburger again but at a different location..."}
{"text":"The food is good (when they get the order right) but I am dumbfounded that during the lunch rush hour with 15 people in line, there is ONE cashier."}
{"text":"First time here for a quick lunch bite with friends. The service was quick & not really friendly, but not rude. I ordered the classic smash burger, and it's okay. I liked the fries but not really love them. My friend ordered the bbq salad and wasn't really that great, but looked good. She described as just lettuce with bbq sauce. Probably won't be back because there are better burgers around the area. Decor is fun!"}
{"text":"They have far exceeded my expectations over several visits. If you have an issue, they make it right immediately. I had a call ahead order that came with mistakes and the manager took care of my concerns promptly. He was so friendly!! All the staff seem to care about making the customer happy.
I recommend the Spinach and Goat cheese salad with grilled chicken. My husband gets their Sin City burger. Very happy with our food every time."}
{"text":"This place is very similar to Five Guys Burgers and In and Out burger.  I think one of things I like compared to those mentioned, is the garlic oil fries.  Some people don't like the thinner fries, but I love them and especially with the garlic flavor.  The burgers are pretty big, and can be ordered as a single or double.  They have a good number of extras you can get on the burgers.  There are plenty of pre-configured burger selections, as well as an option to build your own.  Many of the standard toppings are free no matter how many of them you want, while the more elite toppings will cost you such as bacon, avacado etc.  I think the one negative is that the price is a little bit high.  For the single with garlic oil fries and a drink was just shy of $9.00.  I personally don't think that is super expensive, but I know I can get burgers from other places that are just as good for a few bucks cheaper.  The price at In and Out is usually less than $7.00 for me.  So all in all the food has been good, but the extra few dollars I have to spend makes me rate this a bit lower."}
{"text":"Just yumm...period.
Every1 in family always happy with order. Burgers, chicken, sides...its all good."}
{"text":"Food was good but they looked understaffed and I had to walk back to the counter to remind the cashier I had ordered a shake by that time I had already finished eating. Annoying but the taste didn't suffer because of it. Food can taste great but service needs to be on point, sorry it just isn't."}
{"text":"I tried the black bean burger on the spicy baja style and it was good except I didn't really like the black bean patty. it was okay but I would never come back here since it's not that good. the French fries are skinny and delicious. the regular meat burgers might be okay but I don't think what I ate was worth the price of it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place ever!! I love almost everything on the menu! The food was delicious as always I had an amazing milkshake and my food came out very quickly. I took my husband for the first time and he is a big fan as well. I felt so welcomed there and was treated very well. She really made my day :) The place is clean and all the faces are friendly. I got everything I needed and left happily ! I will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Pricey but tasty. 5 stars for food. Server suggests u pirate wifi from Subway next door since they do not offer. Bummer! 
Burgers comparable to Habit grill. 
Not as good as What a Burger or the Chuckbox in Tempe ( can get beer w burger at Chuck)"}
{"text":"The quality continues to plummet.  The grilled chicken sandwich is limp and wet.  The quality of meat tastes lower.  The meat is no longer smashed the same and charred as it was before.  I highly doubt I will come back here again.  This is definitely not the same quality as when it first opened.  They either need to bring back the staff that started this location or do some major quality control.  Trust me when I say the product has degraded in a major way since opening.  If I wanted food that tastes like wendys I would go to wendys and pay wendys prices."}
{"text":"Best burger in town!  Beats Delux, The Grind, Zinburger and Indulge...I could eat that Arizona Burger daily.  The smashfries are also delicious and you can't beat those Haagen-Dazs milkshakes.  Did I mention it was cheap too?  Yummmm  Smashburger!"}
{"text":"I love Smashburger (outside of the cost).  Great tasting burgers (avocado club & buffalo and blue cheese are my go-to's).  My wife likes the chicken burgers, I like the local brew's (OMB!), my kids like the shakes, and we all like the fries.

The place is always clean and I like being able to sit outside when the weather's nice."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this place since it opened a few years ago. It's definitely superior to Five Guys and it edges out Mad Mikes, but sometimes I really crave a burger with pineapple on it. I usually get the Bluegrass Burger, that they've now renamed the Buckeye Burger ( hey! Ohio is four miles over there!) and the sweet potato fries. I've read a few of these reviews where people talk about too much grease, I only noticed my food being really greasy once and hey, it's burgers and fries! So the grease must either be fixed or is just a sometimes problem. My burger today is excellent. The place has a nice clean atmosphere and service is usually friendly and quick. If I'm not here during rush the manager will check in and talk to me (like today) More pricey than McDs or BK but that's real beef beef in your burger, not whatever they use at the other places... Go for it you will most likely enjoy it!"}
{"text":"WHAT!!!!! SMASHBURGER DOESN'T HAVE CHERRY COKE ANYMORE!  that is such CRAP! they have changed the menu too many times... it's just not worth going there anymore... The mushroom swiss burger was a little pricy.... but I would indulge every once in awhile.... Then they started switching it up.... Truffle mayo and adding arugula... YUCK!!!! I get change... but what in the hell were they thinking! 
I had a coupon... and I was still upset with how much I spent there."}
{"text":"I was finally dragged in here by my friend William... I just got tired of hearing how fantastic this place was. WOW! He was right! I went in there with high expectations and the people at Smashburger hit all of them. I ordered a create your own burger with cheese and avocado and mushrooms. YUM! But since William was with me he INSISTED that I taste his mushroom Swiss burger. Now that is a thing of BEAUTY! The smashfries...not my favorite.. but I probably just don't like the rosemary on my fries. 
  So here it is the next day... I want a mushroom Swiss burger of my very own! It exceeded my expectations and beyond. I gave the haystack onions a shot... Fantastic! It also comes with a horseradish sauce that will clear your sinuses and please your palate. Then William started in on the shakes... Haagen dazs.. mmm I want one now."}
{"text":"Since the dawn of time philosophers, religious scholars, and drunken frat boys have debated the same question: What is the top fast food burger place- 5 guys or Smash Burger? If you said In N Out please stop reading this review and flog yourself. 

I have to say that while it's close I give a slight edge to Smash. Sure the burgers are smaller, sure you don't get an extra 5 lbs of fries shoveled into your bag, sure you can't eat salted in the shell peanuts and throw the shells at the staff (your supposed to do that right?) - but damnit they have milkshakes and sweet potato fries and that is what it takes to win.

Let's start with the burger- the only option for any self respecting Vegasite is the Sin City. There is no other burger like it in the counter- certainly not any of the exact same burger with a different city- specific name in every other town with a SmashBurger- this thing is unique to Vegas. Bacon, fried egg, onion strings- the most delicious threesome since that time I met your mom and sister. Its a tad hard to eat without it falling apart- but the poor structural integrity just means you have to shovel it into your pie hole faster before it collapses mysteriously like tower 7. 

The Shakes- I enjoy Haagen Daz ice cream regularly while wearing a smoking jacket in my study, sitting in my rich leather recliner having my feet massaged by a faceless servant- and with Smashburger I can replicate that somewhat out in the world amongst the unwashed masses. The ice cream is really rich which improves the flavor of shakes like Oreo but doesn't match well with shakes like Butterfinger so plan accordingly. 

The fries- Sweet potato Smash fries are the move- and make sure they come loaded with lots ofherbs and dripping with oil- otherwise reject them like a deformed Spartan Baby. 

Are you supposed to bus your baskets at this place or leave them on the table? No one knows..."}
{"text":"Great food, ridiculously slow service...
We've even tried calling in advance, the representative said about 7 min it would be ready. When we arrived it was still another 20 minutes...
I'm not sure if it's the management or what...If it's between here and waiting to be seated at a restaurant, might as well go to a restaurant as you'll be eating in around the same amount of time..."}
{"text":"The burger itself was pretty good and tender, and we had two different types of fries with them, both were good, I had the Rosemary ones, and wife had the Sweet Potato one, while I love potatoes, but not sweet potatoes these things are starting to make me like Sweet potatoes!
Since they had Coke products and I refuse to drink Coke, went with a Root Beer, and that was pretty good.
The service was pretty friendly and prompt, I would have no problems returning here!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of a good burger, and this place had decent burgers I will say, but nothing to write home about.  I would say they're a little bigger than Wendy's, but about on par with the taste of a burger I can get at Wendy's.  The only thing better was the bun.  And you can customize your toppings a little better there as well, but you're also paying a premium price.  Their prices weren't terrible, more than Wendy's, but about the same as Five Guys.

The burgers are a little less greasy than Five Guys, and again, their bun is a lot better than Five Guys.  Their fries however were nowhere near as good as Five Guys.  We got the Smash Fries, which are fries, which are dipped in olive oil, and then sprinkled with rosemary and garlic.  I will say the taste of the coating was really good, but we got a large to split, and by the time I we were half way through, I was wishing my fries weren't so oily.  So if you're getting the Smash Fries, maybe stick with a small.  They were also just frozen fries, thin cut, similar to Mcdonalds.  

The service was decent, but it wasn't busy when we went.  We got our burgers within about 3 minutes, so nothing to complain about there.

Overall, I'd say I doubt I'll be back anytime soon.  It was ok food, but it didn't wow me enough to make a special trip there."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Smashburger, especially when they first came to Charlotte. I'm not sure if they revamped the burgers or are trying to cut down on costs, but the burgers are simply not the same. They're much smaller and lack flavor. I ordered a regular and a large size burger and they looked exactly the same (and again, smaller than they used to be). For an average $7-$8 burger, it's just not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, but honestly nothing toooooo special.  The burgers and chicken sandwiches are good and I wouldn't mind dining here again, but it's not something I crave or get super excited about going to. 

I don't like that you have to order everything separately. I'm a student so I can get the student special which is a combo, but other than that it's all separate. Too expensive for my taste. 

All in all, if you wanna try it, go for it! But if you don't, then don't worry..you're not really missing out haha"}
{"text":"This place gave me a horrible experience. The workers there were lazy and super slow, the cashier asked for a \"second\" to make a shake and took her like 10 minutes to make it and this other 2 people where just talking and no one was worried about taking care of us and the line was just getting bigger and bigger. Super slow service. 

I thought everything was over and I was like, never again. 

The things got even worst. I got food poisoning for the first time in my life :/ this is the less I can do. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Smash Fries are great, my burger was delicious and you could taste the freshness. The only downside is that it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"$20+ for a burger, fries, and soda.  The food was fine, it was just overpriced by a factor of 3.  Just like the rest of the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"I wanna start off by saying I love the staff here. Right when I walk in I get a loud \"hello\" and they ask me about my day. They always have energy and they are always happy. The foods okay just regular burgers that any place can truly have. But I would consider this place over McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Etc... It just feels more fresh. I love this place the prices are a little high. But nothing I can really complain about. Can't seem to see why their are bad reviews."}
{"text":"A nice flavorful spin on an otherwise bombed out and depleted American favorite.

A little background on the reviewer: i HATE burgers. Most of the bbqs my group had during my military service days were mostly dominated by frozen pre-made burger patties and bland tasteless buns dominated with ketchup and mustard to offer some taste to the otherwise lame and boring mass produced then frozen and shipped or mass baked and full of preservatives buns. Since these days i have ensured no patties of any type is allowed on my own personal home grill. Every time i crave a burger i strictly stick to my favorite chain: In n Out or Sonics.

Smash Burger renews my faith in burgers. Someone dumped a whole bunch of menus on the tables of the little area at the Charleston CSN campus i like to hang out in after class. Out of curiosity i picked one up and browsed. A few types of burgers made my mouth water specifically the Sin City and the Baja as well as their Smash Fries. I informed a buddy of mine and we made it a point to check out. A few days later we barely made it with half an hour before closing time. 

The first thing that struck me was the price and the size of the portions for 1/3rd lb patty burgers. A single burger in a 1/3rd lb side is roughly the price of a chain's value meal but does not include drink or fries. 'This better be the best damn burger i've ever ate' I thought to myself. The second thing that struck me was the tip jar. There were two twenties, a five and a few tens in there...wow they must be doing SOMETHING right.

So we ordered out burgers: One Sin City, One Baja, reg fries, smash fries and two waters. The burgers were Med-Well due to store policy they wouldnt go med-rare but offered med-well. They also cut the burgers in half at our request.

The soda fountain was nicely stocked in the fact that they had fresh (not dry but soft and juicy) lemon wedges.

Burgers and fries came roughtly 15 minutes later. First impression: Damn i forgot to ask for no onions on the Sin City my bad... Second Impression: Wow this burger is fresh...Very Fresh...OMFG I THINK I'M BURNING MY TONGUE WITH THIS BURGER! SPIT IT OUT! no wait...this is actually pretty good....OH GOD MY TONGUE IS BURNING!!

True story i actually burned my tongue on the first bite. 

The Sin City Burger is something you'd want to eat everyday but dont because you dont want to begin to count the calories. Very flavorful due to the fried eggs and fried onions, the Smash Sauce they use has a nice zing to it as well. VERY impressed even if it did render my taste buds numb for the next few days.

The Baja burger was something else entirely. Most 'spicy' burgers (that arent chicken) have such a heat to it that there's no flavor. Others have flavor but just a little hint of heat. the Baja was PERFECTLY BALANCED and was amazing. First bite i could taste the bun and the sauce a few chews later intergrated the juicy beef and between third and fourth the heat began to rise. The second bite reset the whole experience right down to the end.

The standard fries were standard fries but the oil they used was changed out recently and it showed int he quality.

The smash fries were a bit greasy but had a very nice rosemary essence. In my opinion they were too weak on the garlic and too heavy on the olive oil. 

Despite the higher price compared to fast food chains my comrade and made several notations to the staff that they'll be seeing us again and more frequently in future.

Overall i would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a flavorful burger.

In the future i'd like to try the veggie fries and add garlic mushrooms to the Sin City and Baja burgers."}
{"text":"I've tried the original Smash burger and the Truffle Mushroom Swiss. Both were really good. Fries are average but they also offer fried pickles and sweet potato fries. Chicken sandwiches and salads are also on the menu along with some eclectic burger options. The service and staff are AMAZING. They offer a self serve coke freestyle machine as well."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town. We had been to Smashburger before but we never received service like this before. It was a Saturday yet we were greeted like we were the only ones in the place, placed our order, friendly and then we were seated. Within a few moments our food arrived. The food was hot, juicy and quick. The store was clean.  Awesome job to Braden and his staff.  You Rock!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I don't know what they put in their burger but I think they are the best I ever had!

Service was even better, The place was packed however took care of us very well!
I wish their new business years of success!

I am so excited to have a new restaurant like this close to us in NE Mesa! Have the fried pickles you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Only thing that's been negatively consistent is the strong, uneasy aroma you smell once you walk in to this location. It stinks and they need to do something about that..."}
{"text":"I really like the burgers at this place. We were wandering around the strip and after shopping at Banana Republic, I didn't want to venture back to the strip looking for a place to eat.  We've stayed at Caesar's Palace before and didn't want to eat at the restaurants and since we were only in Vegas for a 1 night layover, we wanted something quick so we could get back to our airport hotel to sleep.

The Caesar food court usually has poor quality options which are severely overpriced.  I decided to try Smashburger as I've heard of it even 'tho I'm not a fan of burgers in general.  I was surprised that the burger was better than I expected.  It was seasoned and moist.  I especially liked their smash fries which was seasoned with herbs, rosemary.  Even Hubby (who opted for pizza) liked the fries.  I would consider coming back here for a burger when we're in Vegas again, and also try their sweet potato fries.  It was certainly less costly for a burger here with fries, about $13 than if we had a burger at Bobby Flay's or Gordon Ramsey's places."}
{"text":"I realize this place is probably known for its burgers and not its chicken sandwiches, but really? Any restaurant should take at least SOME pride in each of the items they've put on the menu. I have never seen a more pathetic excuse for a chicken sandwich. This piece of chicken was literally thinner than a slice of lunch meat. Sorry, Smashburger, but not even the glopped on mayo or delicious French fries can cover up this sad attempt at a chicken sandwich. I will not be back. Can you even see the chicken in my picture? Probably not. I am so very disappointed. And hungry."}
{"text":"Very very good burgers! I love that you can put fried eggs on them too. If you want a very greasy but tasty burger try this place, it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I got the Classic Smash burger and it was delicious, my only complaint is the bottom bun was almost soaked as soon as I got it. Oh, and if you eat here you have to get their smash fries, soaked in olive oil, rosemary, and garlicy goodness!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and ordered food and when they bagged them they dropped my fries then scooped them up out them back in the bag and laughed while doing it. I asked for new ones and I got \"why there's nothing wrong with these\" now keep in mind this was the manager. Terrible service and bad food handling practices."}
{"text":"I will give 3 cheers and a tiger to the burgers hell yeah but those wack -ass fries got to go. You do everything right with the burgers, size, weight,  prep all good. Everything to add is there, bacon, avacado, grilled  onions, egg bun, like that but back it up with some good french fries .Those skinny dry sticks don't do it. A burger such as yours deserves better fries, you can't go wrong with crinkle cut, just a thought.Not whining just concerned,  thank you."}
{"text":"First time here, very clean & friendly staff. Ordered food to go since I didn't have much time to dine in, unfortunately it seems like dinning in would of been faster, waiting for a to go order felt like forever. The burger was ok, seemed smaller than in the pictures. Fries were great since I do love thin crispy fries. Maybe I'll try their online ordering next time for a faster to go order."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 burgers,2 fries and fried pickles.  Had coupon for free burger.  So basically  $20 for 1 burger, 2 fries, fried pickles.  
2 stars for the burger.  
0 stars for smash fries
0 stars for smash fries we didn't get.  It's okay cuz they were not good.
0 stars for fried pickles which had almost no breading and about half the order literally had no breading.  Basically it was a hot pickle.  Yum.  Not.  So not worth it.  $20 with a coupon for"}
{"text":"I didn't hear great things about Smashburger but my mom and I wanted to check it out and I was so pleasantly surprised!! I got a kids burger with plain fries and WOW. The burger was huge for a kids size and it tasted great. There was a lot of sauce but it was good. I LOVED the fries. I love skinny, crispy french fries and thats exactly what they were! Perfect size to my burger. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I got so many recommendations from strangers to coworkers to give this place a try! Alright, Alright I've had enough! Came here the other day to have a smashin' lunch!

Sin City Smashburger: fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, american cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and their own \"smash sauce\" on an egg bun.

- I saw \"egg\" with burger and I didn't have to read any further. I ordered the 1/2 pounder. Pretty Damn Tasty and Salty might I add. The buns were nice and fluffy yet not too soft, bacon was ordinary (I didn't really notice much apple smoked flavor), medley of onions were great, their \"Smash\" sauce was green and creamy (not bad) and the meat was Juicy and Salty. I prefer less salt on anything I eat but the saltiness in this burger was obvious but wasn't tongue blistering salty. Overall, Still A Very Good Burger

Smashfries: tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.

- ingredients sounded fun and it defintely was! Nice alternate from the usual ordinary french fries! Decent portion too!

I would give this place an easy 5 Stars but the burger meat was just a little too Salty.."}
{"text":"Heard this is the place to go to.  Well, no.  My wife and I went for lunch while on vacation during the week.  Nobody was there-on the weekends it is crazy.  Ok the fries were awesome.  I bit in to my hamburger and it tasted funny so I looked at it and sure enough it was pretty raw on the inside.  My wife's was pink, but mine was raw.  Manager came over after we waited 15 min for a new one.  Tried to explain it was raw, but he just made excuses like that is how they cooked them.  Tried to explain the difference between mine and hers but he wouldn't listen.  Complained on their web site over a week ago and they never even responded.  Good enough for me-I'm done with you Smashburger-never will see a dime of my money again."}
{"text":"Actually surprised at how good my burger was here! Great service & free fries if you fill out the survey on your receipt."}
{"text":"They are not gluten free. They say their fries are but failed to recognize that their fries are made in the same fryer as everything else. Just because you offer a gluten free bun doesn't give you the right to say you offer products that are gluten free.  If you can't figure that out I think I'll pass on the bun and burger."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant is SMASHBURGER. 
Order a burger! Order a LARGE burger. The special burgers are consistently tasty. The smash fries with rosemary, salt and olive oil are delicious. French fried Onion pieces are very good and we like adding them to our burgers.

Look for coupons. There are lots of them! Use them and you could have a filling burger and fries and a drink for two for under 20 bucks! Cheap date night.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating. Although the outdoor seating overlooks the parking lot, the weather in Arizona during half the year still makes it very pleasant to sit outside! During the summer, sit in the nice cold air conditioned part!"}
{"text":"Had a coupon for the opening and really wanted to love this place. I'm an In-N-Out burger fan and thought this would be close. Not so much. Burger was greasy and bottom half of bun was saturated and falling apart. Ended up removing the bun and using a knife and fork. Better for me I guess. Fewer carbs. Shoe-string onion rings are great as a burger topping (which I did not order) but not so much as a side (which I did order). Tangled web of thin fried onions almost impossible to dip in ketchup. Onion rings as a side should be full size onion rings and not burger topper shoe strings.

Servers were nice, bring food to your table, but order taker was rather abrupt. Very cold and drafty inside.

If you don't have a coupon I would suggest going somewhere else for a better quality burger at the same full price."}
{"text":"Not bad for 3:30am after a night of gambling and drinking. This location is in a casino food court. I'd heard great things about Smash Burger, I think maybe a stand alone store might have yielded a higher rating. At the end of the night, they were open and got the job done."}
{"text":"We had just finished volunteering at Feed My Starving Children and it was about 8:00 in the evening so we decided to stop here for a quick dinner in the area. 

My boyfriend had never had Smashburger before and I had it once probably 2 years ago. I went with the truffle mushroom swiss burger with fried chicken instead of hamburger meat. My boyfriend went with the classic and we also shared some of their smash fries. 

There's an In-N-Out down the street but we wanted to give this place a try. There was one other customer in there when we arrived and the place was quiet. The guy working there wasn't all that friendly or lively so this probably isn't a job he really enjoys. 

The chicken patty used for my sandwich was pretty good but it's essentially a tasty chicken tender. It was kinda messy and I think it's due to possible truffle oil? The Smash fries were nothing special - it's supposedly tossed in olive oil, rosemary and garlic and I didn't taste anything. It could be that I burned my tongue when I bit into the chicken sandwich... or it could be that these smash fries were just plain fries with some dired rosemary sprinkled on top. I probably will never know.

I asked my boyfriend how he liked his burger - he said it was just okay. I felt bad that I pointed this place out that night and ended up with a mediocre meal. We probably won't be back at another location and definitely not this one since we live a bit away."}
{"text":"Oh my this smash burger has to have the RUDEST employees. I came in on a Friday night and with about 6 staff members just standing around the front they had a line and only one register open. I ordered online and was told it did not go through. So then they all just stare and go \"for here or Togo?\" Uhhh TOGO I ordered ONLINE. After ordering the people behind me got so frustrated that their order took 4 employees to try and figure out how to enter it in they left.. this place seriously needs an attitude check for all employees!"}
{"text":"Who goes to Vegas and gets a Smashburger?! I DO..and it was good as hell.  Honestly, I have never experienced a Smashburger.  I didn't even know Smashburger existed.  Since my girl and I were just traveling through Las Vegas, we didn't want to indulge into all that \"Sin City\" cravings.  That definitely includes food, with all those tempting Lobster and Steak buffets.  

Instead, we were headed to In and Out and saw Smashburger across the street.   THANK YOU JESUS FOR BEING BEHIND OUR STEERING WHEEL, and steering us straight on over to Smashburger instead.  Now, we will forever be into some In and Out burgers - but not only did Smashburgers show out with their Spicy Fries and BBQ Bacon Cheddar Big Smash Burger, but Smashburgers also showed out with their incredible customer service.  

The  guy behind the register was awesome with communicating the local favs and when the store manager found out we were travelers, traveling through, he offered some Smashburger dollars or us to try other Smashburgers along our roadtrip route.  

We will definitely be adding Smashburgers to our favorite list of burger spots."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, good fast-food burgers that are a bit tastier than other places. Arizona burger is delicious - as delicious as a fast food burger can get and they have gluten free buns which is a huge bonus! My kids love the mini-burgers and fries. My issue with this place, and a lot of other restaurants that we order take out from, is that they ALWAYS forget to give us our kids drinks. Maybe it's because I always request organic milk for my kids as part of their kids' meal and I know that's more expensive than asking for soda pop ... Who knows ... but I feel like it's a purposeful \"oops forgot your drink\" because every single time my hubby picks up an order the milk for my kids is forgotten. Our bad really as we should double check, but their bad for consistently failing to provide part of our meal."}
{"text":"Very good burgers a little confused on how to order at first but in the end we got burgers that were \"smashed\" fries were bomb, the meat patty tasted very fresh and the service was great. Resturant was clean. This location in on Vegas Blvd and is located in front of the South Premium outlet. 

I will defiantly come here again. I have them a 3 star not because it was bad but because they are so hyped and it was good not crazy good but worth coming back. I like it and you should try it too!"}
{"text":"Super tasty burgers and fries! One of our favorites! I love the rosemary fries and their chicken sandwiches are also super tasty! This is our second favorite under Fez."}
{"text":"I love the food. But they are understaffed. I always have to wait for my order to be taken. I've been here for almost 15 minutes in line. They need at least 1 or 2 people up front for orders, cleaning up and serving. Needs to fixed asap. This location is in a busy area and needs to accommodate the traffic.


*** I put my order in to be picked up also at 11:45. Came into the store to pay and didn't leave until shortly after 1205 p.m. after getting settled with my food I come to find out my fries are cold cold. I've been trying to call this location since about 12:15 p.m. and they still won't pick up."}
{"text":"I gotta admit i liked this place a lot. The food was really really good. Ive already planned what I'm ordering the next time i go! The counter area could have been a little more productive when it came to helping customers but once you've ordered the service was quick. I ordered the Sin City burger with sweet potato fries and i was so pleased with this meal. I would def suggest this place for a quick bite to eat at a fair price! Super easy to find and alot of parking here...Def check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Smash two times now and have had a consistent experience both times.  My burger was tasty covered in BBQ sauce, haystack onions and bacon.  My fries were crisp and best dipped in a side of chipotle ranch (make sure you ask for it, it's free!).  You spend about 10 bucks for the burger and fries, but when you compare that with the various burger places nearby where 10 bucks gets you just the burger, Smash isn't so pricey."}
{"text":"It's important to know that Smashburger is more than just burgers.  As someone who doesn't eat hamburgers, I had never thought to check this place out until now.  You can get any of their burgers as either a grilled or crispy chicken sandwich.  Win!  (They also offer a veggie burger).  I ordered the local special, which came with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, and jalapeno slices.  Everything was very fresh, even the guacamole.  I was a little surprised at the size of the crispy chicken breast, as it seemed a tad small - I guess because I'm used to the super-sized ones you get at a lot of restaurants.  It was certainly more than enough food, just caught me off guard.

Overall, it was a very good sandwich, and I enjoyed the sweet potato fries as well.  The only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 4 is that it's a little on the pricey side.  $12 for my sandwich, a water, and some sweet potato fries.  Not going to break the bank, but enough that I couldn't eat here for lunch every day.  I will say though that for the occasional treat it is worth it.  I do feel that the freshness and quality of the food justifies the price."}
{"text":"It was alright. I've had better burgers. And I've had worse burgers. It was cooked ok and flavorful enough. And I liked the bun. But the toppings were barely there. And the burger just wasn't juicy. The fries were not particularly flavorful and a bit mushy. The ordering process was smooth. The food was ready quickly. But since we were the last people in there, the staff were eager and a tad impatient for us to be done and leave. Not exactly the best experience. But not a terrible experience either. So it comes out to a-ok."}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen! 
You wanna talk about one of the best burgers in town? This is it!!!!
 I'm not saying it's the Best, still have a few places to try, but it's def on my Top 5!

I have the SinCity Burger-seasoned meat, fried egg, special sauce and grilled onions with a basket of sweet potato fries! 

I fell asleep with the burger in my hand because I was determined to finish the entire thing!
I later woke up, burger still in hand, finished it cold and it was still tasty!

I'm a customer forever!

True Story!"}
{"text":"On this visit, I decided to order the Harvest Salad.  This salad includes a mix of greens -including spinach, along with tomatoes, raisins, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and blue cheese crumbles.  It is served with a  balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I also added grilled chicken to it.  Something gave the salad a saltly flavor - not sure whether it was the salad dressing, the chicken breast, or the blue cheese crumbles but it  detracted from my enjoyment of the salad. I am not sure what it is about Smashburger, but they seem to make everything a little too salty for my preference.  David got an order of Smashfries tonight and I thought those tasted a little too salty as well.

Each time I come here, I want to really like this place, but its just \"ok\" not great."}
{"text":"Another in the ever expanding line up of fast casual dining establishments.

I like the food. Burgers and toppings are fresh. Fries are good too, but I don't like the shoe string style. Also nice being able to get a GF bun and eat my burger like a normie.

What I really like though, is the employees are always super friendly. And the place is always clean. Not sure if they pay them decent wages or if they just have a good manager."}
{"text":"Ahhhh! I hate this location SO much. Order is wrong literally every single time. Ordered the attached and ended up with no tots and instead of one of our burgers ended up with a random fried chicken burger. One might ask why we didn't go back and have them correct the order. Well, they're slow and with this place it's such a nightmare that we didn't even want to deal with it. Another time I tried to place a to go order and they never answered the phone for 30 minutes. Finally I arrived there and walked in to just place my to-go order in person and the phone was ringing off the hook with no one answering it. Only about 3 parties in the restaurant so I'm not sure why they were so \"overwhelmed.\" To go orders are never hot. Did I say I haaaaaaaate this location? I'm done...like the guy below, I guess I can only blame myself at this point."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time and love it. Had the Brunswick fries and they were awesome. Burgers are great as well especially the CYB w/egg. I recommend this place. Gotta go eat there"}
{"text":"In November, I visited this Smashburger, and did not have a good experience. 
Today, I decided to give them another try (after all, I was at Tempe Marketplace and starving! ) and had a very different experience. 
I had the mushroom/swiss burger with fries, and both were delicious. 
The burger was juicy, hot and cooked to just the right temperature. The fries were hot and yummy, as well. 
I stand corrected: Smashburger is damned good!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy! No more drives to Tempe for my fix...
Awesome burgers...nice, big, new location!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a always friendly staff. My personal favorite being the arizona burger. With cripsy jalapeños and lettuce  and vibrant tomotoes and onion you can tell they are using high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Russell is amazing !! Keep that beautiful spirit up .. as far as the rest of the service and food .. also outstanding!! Thank you for a great lunch experience."}
{"text":"On my the burgers here are awesome. I love the BBQ bacon burger and the smash fries. My girlfriend and Me took some out of town friends here and they all loved it too.  They couldn't stop raving about them. The chicken is good too but i prefer the burgers. They have good chicken tenders for kids.  Often when we get chicken for the kids they are cold or hard. Every Time the chicken is fresh, hot, and tasty.  the Service is good and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I really like this Smashburger in the Desert Ridge food court the best so far. Right next to the big outdoor fireplace and kid's water play area. Been to a few others including one in Fargo, ND and they are all yummy good. Each region does there own twist on a special burger with flavors from the area. Fargo does a North Dakota version of a burger on a pretzel bun and a Dog with a smoked sausage. So good.

Here in AZ they spice things up a notch by added jalapenos, habanero cheese and chipotle sauce on a spicy chipotle bun. Inside is simple and basic. Just place your order and sit down to be served. The menu has several options. Food is cooked to order. They have Burgers of course, Hot Dogs, Chicken Sandwiches, Salads, and several tasty sides including local craft beer if you wish to wet your whistle.

I normally get the Big AZ Burger which has Habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo and fresh jalapeños on a spicy chipotle bun. Today I was feeling extra hungry for a AZ Devil Dog to feed my Sunday cat nap. Poke me with a fork. The wife enjoyed a regular size Avocado Burger which has fresh avocado, applewood-smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, ranch dressing and mayo on a multi-grain bun. Could not resist a side order of Smash fries tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.

They are not the cheapest burgers in town but well worth the little extra when you want a great tasting, quickly served, upscale burger without all the extra nonsense. See ya there next time. Smash it Baby!"}
{"text":"Love the food way to much for what it is. And they won't even do an novel easy egg on your burger. That was a huge let down. Who wants a hard fried egg on there burger."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Great customer service.  Pretty fast.  Consistent delivery cupid hamburger and flat chicken burger that is always tender and juicy."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place from friends so I decided to try it out.  I ordered 2 burgers, fries, and a soda.  It cost me 17 dollars!!!!  That is very high for a burger.  I'm not really sure if this place is considered fast food, but compared other burger places I frequent it was definitely the most expensive.  I built my own burger, and I like my burgers pretty simple.  The burger was disappointing though, size was good for a single patty, but I could probably have gotten a double for the same price at any other place.  The actual patty was pretty bland, the rest of the toppings and bun were pretty good, but without a good patty they can only go so far.  The fries were also kind of bland.  They were advertised with rosemary and garlic on them.  I've had good garlic fries and these were nowhere close, I got a faint hint of garlic, not a wake up all my senses amount of garlic that I was hoping for.  Overall the price was the real killer.  If I could have gotten my order for 5 dollars less I would consider going back, but there are better burgers out there for less money."}
{"text":"another disappointing visit to smashburger. i got the avocado chicken club, crispy with no tomato. it comes to the table, GRILLED. also the order of smashfries was incredibly skimpy. i actually mentioned it and received more, so kudos there i guess. i ordered a side of petal sauce which took 10 minutes, was told they were making a new batch...found that pretty weird. isn't that what a.m. prep does?  the chicken sandwich was something comparable to mcdonald's or wendy's and around the same price. not impressed.

i was so excited about this smashburger opening and it has done nothing but disappoint me.  i think maybe i'll go back to the other tempe location and see if it's still good because i'm not going back to this one for a looooooooong time."}
{"text":"Smashburger is good stuff. They have good quality meats and cheeses along with decent bread. The bread was not as good as I'd like but the restaurant location and setup are great and the service is excellent as well so if you want a great cheeseburger check out this smashburger - you'll really like it!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with their fries, I was expecting them to be more bigger than their actual size. Their burgers stay true to size. When you purchase something make sure you keep the receipt because if you buy one dessert you get one free. There is also free refills, wifi, and a Starbucks nearby. Be patient because during the late night it's full of starved drunkies, who want to cut you in line."}
{"text":"I'm no longer a Smashburger virgin! While hanging out at Desert Ridge, my stomach started to tug at my strings. I jokingly mentioned Panda Express to my wife and she gave me the stink eye (I had it two days in a row). With so many choices in the area, it was definitely a hard decision but I was craving something different. Smashburger was on the bucket list and today it presented itself as my growling stomach couldn't stand it anymore.

As my wife and I walked in we were promptly greeting. We grabbed a menu from the wall holder and examined it as we stood in line. There were certainly enough choices on the menu that it was a struggle to decide what I wanted. Being a hardcore wings fan, I settled on the Buffalo & Blue Cheese burger. This burger has Frank's® RedHot® Buffalo Sauce, blue cheese crumbles, lettuce, tomato & mayo on an egg bun. Since I'm not a rabbit, I omitted the lettuce and tomato. My wife had the Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger. Her burger contained truffle mayo, sautéed crimini mushrooms & aged Swiss on an egg bun. 

The verdict... AWESOME! The burger was like nothing I have had before. The bun was soft and flavorful. The burger was \"smashed\" but perfectly seasoned and topped with the tangy hot sauce and blue cheese.  I wouldn't have changed anything because it was just right.  I also had a bite of my wife's burger and I must say, that was pretty good as well.

I also purchase a side of fries because they don't come with the burger. There are a couple combo meals that do but the special burgers due not, so you have to pay separately. I ordered the sweet potato fries \"Smashburger\" style. That just means they add Italian olive oil, rosemary and a bit of garlic. This added a perfect side to a great burger and can't be passed up. The total cost for my wife and I was around $23. That included two burgers, two side of fries and two drinks. If you are in the area and have a craving for a good burger, give Smashburger a try. You just may be pleasantly surprised! Bon Appétit"}
{"text":"Went in for a to go order. There was no wait in line to order. Placed my order of two hamburgers, three fries and a salad. After 25 minutes(I'm being generous, it was probably 30) she brought me my food. I bag was the salad. The other bag seemed light, yep missing one hamburger and one order of fries. I went back to tell them. The cook seemed upset. Turns out she was the manager. She asked me \"what do you want\" I said \"just my food, that's all\"..
Horrible service!  Rude manager!  I can't imagine what they are like when they're busy. With all the food options at this location do yourself a favor and hit up Chick-fil-a or In-N-Out Burger. They are all about customer service with an awesome product. Sorry Smashburger I'm smashing you out of my food options!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great-just like you used to make at home. All toppings are nice and fresh. Fries are always nice and crispy. Josh is always helpful in ordering and always checks to see \"how things are\". Store always nice and clean with tables cleared off quickly. SUGGESTION: Make menu board lettering a bit larger. Very difficult to read the small print."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Had a chicken sandwich that was decent. Vegas has amazing restaurants but it's a hit or miss with fast food like this. They gave me extra veggies when asked which was nice and it was a thin piece of chicken which is how I like it, but also wish there was more meat"}
{"text":"Burgers are an institutional icon for all that is good about being an Albertan and carnivore. There are hundreds of places you can get a burger in this fine city, but only a few that truly shine. Each of them are unique in their own way, bringing a little something different to the table. Some go for the gargantuan portions, striving to set the bar higher and higher with more and more toppings like fried eggs, avocadoes, pineapple, bacon, foie gras, onion rings while some focus on the integrity of the beef and the quality of their essential elements.

So here comes Smashburger, an American chain from Denver throwing their hat into the ring with their trademark 'smashburger' - a ball of fresh ground beef that's literally smashed into the flattop with a metal plate. Calgary, by the way, being the first city outside the US for them (great choice!).

The first thing I like about Smashburger is the flow. You line up to place your order at the counter. Placed at the end of the line is a menu stand, so that you can peruse the menu as you wait in the line (a common occurrence at lunchtime). The menu choices are plain and simple with a choice of 6 signature burgers (beef patty or chicken breast), a plethora of gourmet toppings as well as a 'build your own burger' option. Sides are plentiful as well with a choice of fries (regular, sweet potato, pickles and veg). I love the Smash fries - an aromatic rosemary and garlic fry with olive oil. Simple, but delicious, even better with sweet potatoes.

Let's talk about the burgers. Although the burgers feature a cavalcade of toppings, the flavour focus is definitely on the beef. It's fresh and it seems that the 'smashing' works. The bun is fluffy and soft, keeps its integrity and frames the meat nicely like a good bun should. American cheese does have a place in cuisine and it's right here... in my burger. Something about that processed slice of cheese works wonders in grilled cheese and good burgers.

What brings me back is the notable little things, in this case, unsweetened iced tea. Yes, its here. The first thing I do when I land on American soil is buy a large iced tea. It's always fresh brewed and non-sweetened. Now I can save myself a plane ride and having my toothpaste taken away by the TSA. Smashburger has an iced tea bar with the aforementioned ice tea, a pomegranate tea as well as a passionfruit green tea. Awesome.

Service and quick and efficient. Once you place your order, you're given a number and your food is brought to your table by a runner. Everything is fast, friendly and tasty. If you are a burger afficionado, I highly recommend Smashburger."}
{"text":"Smash was good the first few times but this location is lacking.  My first bad experience here was when I called in to place an order and the guy taking my order gave me a real hard time.  I asked for a smash burger with cheese no ketchup or smash sauce he acted stupid like he couldn't figure out which burger I was ordering s aid they are all smash burgers and I said wow dude I don't know nobody has ever given me a hard time about this.  He was a jerk so we decided to go to another location instead of enduring more drama funny thing is the other place knew what I was ordering and they didn't give me a hard time.  It's been a while so we went in today got haystack onions that were drowning in puddle of grease and hamburgers also very greasy.  Husband said this was the worst it's ever been.  Looks like it's time to give smash a rest."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger & fries. It could be pricey if you want a lot of toppings. It was not overly crowded and is a good place to go to eat with your friends especially if you want something for a decent price. I really appreciate how the milkshakes come in the cute cups & how they bring out the extra in an additional cup & don't waste it!"}
{"text":"We ordered two triple double burgers one with bacon the other without and the reason for the 2 stars was the bacon burger when it was delivered was literally swimming in a pool of grease/fat. It took three napkins to contain the grease puddle, a fourth one to provide a dry place to rest the burger and two more to wipe the grease off my hands since the bottom of the bun had soaked up a lot of the grease. The flavor was acceptable but nothing like burgers you get at the \"guys\" or the \"in n o\" folks or even freddies. The fries however were hot and tasty. So why didn't I complain? Simply because my wife's burger was also greasy (but not as bad) so I had no illusions any replacement sandwiches wouldn't have the same issue. The place was very clean, the staff friendly and the food arrived quickly too bad the burger was overly greasy and the bacon on one of the sandwiches was tough and quitesalty."}
{"text":"Best burger in Las Vegas and beyond. Whatever magic they perform on the grill is completely unique. I've never tasted a burger so good and with such a unique flavor. Great fries, hot dogs, fried pickles, sides too. I try to eat here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and knew I have had good experiences in the past, so I decided to recommend this place over others in the area.  The window said \"now hiring\" (that should have been my first clue) but the food was disgusting~  I got the arizona burger which was the spicy one with guac, jalepeno, etc and the meat was overcooked, and not how I recall the burgers being.  I also ordered the new brussel sprouts and they were drenched in OIL!  So gross, my guests ordered of course burgers and fried pickles and fries. The fries were nearly raw and the pickles were completely soaked in oil- unedible.  There was only one cook and one person taking orders, so service was slow too. UGH!"}
{"text":"So I have went back to Smashburger twice since I have written my first review and I like it so much more!  

I said in my first review that I would rather go to Red Robin.  Well, just kidding!  Red Robin makes me run to the bathroom after eating there.  (TMI?  whatevs!)

Their egg bun is a perfect compliment to a burger that is \"homemade\".  What I mean, is that it is not perfectly round or square, it looks homemade and tastes delicious.

I wasn't a fan of the rosemary, garlic, olive oil on the fries, but I have become a fan.  I now am a fan of the sweet potatoe smashfries.  yum!

My husband and I came here before the UNLV Basketball and were in and out within 20 minutes and got 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 pop's (soda's for you west-coasters) and the total came to: $19.49.  Can you beat that for a good burger that is not coming from a fast food chain? 

Added two stars: didn't burn my tongue off again and fast service without gross fast food!"}
{"text":"First time eating at a Smashburger. Extremely slow service. The grill people were busy talking as we waited almost 12 minutes for a skinny over salted, maybe 2-3 ounce burger.  They really weren't that busy and the chefs, as I said weren't busting their buns to get food out! I will maybe try them again but not at the airport.  No promises!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is either your thing or not. I have tried this place multiple times and it's ehhh. Nothing memorable.feel like the meat is dry and tasteless, the fries and sweet potatoes fries are usually always cold and limp. I will say the peanut butter shake is bomb!!! This rating was almost a 3 just for that shake. Lines are always super long and it seems to take way too long to order, and there is always one cashier..... I had there chicken salad and it is way overly doused in ranch, I'll have to come back and try the chicken, but burgers are meh, rather go to in n out our five guys over this place any day"}
{"text":"Love the smash fries and the milkshakes (specifically the nutter butter). The burgers are good, but there are better burgers around in my opinion. Still delicious though and I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"This one of my FAVORITE new places! *FRIED PICKLES* I've loved everything i've had so far...just wish the food came out faster :)"}
{"text":"If Original Hamburger Works became a trendy chain with modern decor, it would be Smashburger. 

The burgers, fries and shoestring onions are tasty. For some reason the place smells like raw sewage however. I'm not sure what that is all about. 

Good burger place. But you can get the exact same thing at locally owned Original Hamburger Works on Thomas."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent! I only got the sweet potato smash fries which were like garlic fries! They were good under $3."}
{"text":"ok i'm editing my review, i now love this place, been addicted for past week....must have just been a bad experience the first time i went!

ps: if you dont like your stuff salty just order it with mild seasoning"}
{"text":"This Smashburger lost my business when my wife and I came in to eat dinner one Saturday evening in February.  Every trash bin in the restaurant was overflowing.  Including the ones in the kitchen area.  The floors and tables were filthy.  We ordered two off the menu meals and it took them four trips back to the kitchen to get them correct.  
    I complained to their corporate headquarters and no one ever responded to my complaint.  Too many fine establishments in the area to ever waste my money at Smashburger's again."}
{"text":"One of the singular worst fast food experiences I've had in a long time. And that's saying something, because fast food in notoriously average at best. But, tonight, well, tonight, was hitting a new low. Mind you, they had a new kid working the register and he was fine. But when I see three people in the back all scratching their heads and making grimace faces attempting to get my order...that's unexcusable.

I will post a picture of the pathetic excuse they called onion rings. Not only didn't it fill the measly little paper cup, it was a salt bomb of cold, lumpish onions, I think. Mind you, we got this home before  we inspected the contents, other wise we would have said something on the spot. Something like, 'no friggin' way are those edible', or 'are those actually made of onions.' And the burger was over-cooked and rubbery/chewy in an ice-cold-get-it down-if-you-can way. And this was a new burger they were promoting, so it was less expensive than normal. But even at a cut-rate discount it was way overpriced. McD's crappola dollar menu items would have been better.

Not a good experience to gag down (and not finish). I'm usually ordering the same thing here, but I'm afraid this is scaring me off. It wasn't crowded. It wasn't the least bit busy. and yet, the food was cold, salty, and inedible. And this is in a decent section of town. I think they should Smash this place and re-vamp it alltogether."}
{"text":"This was the fastest, and the friendliest Smashburger we've been to. We were famished. As fate would have it, there was no line. And no wait. Myburger was done by the time it took me to put down my napkins and return with a drink. And though it is a little formulaic at times, it was what I was hoping for. 

I alos have to say that the employees were quite pleasant and efficient. This was on a recent Wednesday and we timed it just right between the lunch crowd and the dinner set. The employees were downright chipper and engaging. Which, this being fast food, was a pleasant delight. And not neccesarily what I'm used to. So give props to the peeps behind the counter at this location.

I mentioned formulaic. Which defines fast food. You are disappointed when it falls flat and comes up short of the pictures that are emblazoned on the walls. Well, this place did the food picture perfect. It had all the fats and sugars that fast food delivers in spades. I think this may be the Samshburger I'll go to from now on."}
{"text":"This location was very clean, run efficiently, and produced a good meal. I've had a bad experience at another location recently, and was a bit concerned with trying the franchise again...but it all worked out in the end.

Even more surprising, was that it was so close to UNLV. And with so many students running around, I wasn't expecting a fast food restaurant to be so organized and on top of things. Plesantly surprised with this location. Even the restrooms were ultra clean.

But you want to know about the food, right? The burger was juicy and loaded with toppings (which, in my case, meant mushrooms). It was cooked fresh and on-the-spot. It was not a heat lamp special. When Smashburger does it right, they hit all the yummy spots they're supposed to. And I've come to realize, if the place is clean and the people serving actually smiling, then it's well worth the risks."}
{"text":"I have been to this location numerous times when I use to live on this side of town. I stopped in for a quick lunch to pass some time a little later in the afternoon. The ordering process was pleasant and the cashier was nice. The floor was greasy enough that I fell, mind you I'm was wearing a boot with no heel, and sober as the day is long. Every table was dirty except the one the manager was giving an interview at and once he had left the dining room after the interview he did not help get any tables clean or delegate anyone else to do so. The chicken sandwich was good. I mixed it up and got the goat cheese and spinach with the balsamic glaze. The only food complaint I had was the fries were extra greasy. Below average experience for a concept I genuinely enjoy."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister and my two year old daughter for lunch. I had a burger, fries and I got my little one a hot dog. The food was good but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. The service was excellent and that is why I award this place four stars. I will definitely give it another shot and hopefully find a 'wow' factor."}
{"text":"The classic burger looks better than it tastes. The sweet potato fries were tasteless and a bit limp. Cute way of serving the entree though. The chocolate malt was amazing even though it took forever to get it. But it was worth the wait. I was not impressed with the cashier that took my order, not friendly and didn't speak clearly enough to understand. Many tables needed to be cleaned off.Floor needed cleaning up as well. Not a place I would return to unless I was desperate for a chocolate malt and it would have to be to go."}
{"text":"My first time trying Smashburger.  I read the reviews about bad customer service. We did not see this. The manager was friendly and got our orders out with 10 or 12 mins. Granted, they were not busy, but I received good service. 

I am glad I tried Smashburger before the place that gives you peanuts to eat while you wait. Because that menu would have cost a two person meal to be $40. Smashburger will feed two people for $20. 

I ordered the Sin City signature burger. It was very good. Defiantly worth the cost. Only thing I would say is the large 1/2 pound burger you can get is really not as big as I thought it would be. But the taste was so good, it was easy to just eat it and not complain. The fries are awesome!! 

I will try it again."}
{"text":"OK, I like new places but should have known that if it close to UNLV it caters to College Students. Two of my children (in their 20's) along with my wife and a newborn granddaughter checked this place out on a Monday morning around 10 am, they open at 10 am. I decided on the Buffalo burger, regular fries, and a Vanilla Milkshake, my wife ordered the Classic with Haystack Fries, (which are shoestring type onion rings), my son-in law ordered the \"Sin City\", with a root beer float (Hagen-das ice cream), my daughter got a Classic with Smash fries, and root beer float. The total for this visit $47.97. I check out the facilities before eating to just wash my hands and get an over view of everything. The restroom was very dirty, especially the corners and the walls, I won't describe it was just bad. They do have a sign indicating they want to be notified if the restrooms are dirty, but who are you really going to tell with one person talking orders, a line of people in front of her and no one else within eye sight. I liked everything I ordered, the fires are salted with sea salt, I should have asked for no salt. They were very salty; my wife didn't care for the grilled onion on her burger and the Haystack fries tasted like a squirt of grease with every bite. My son in- law loved every bite; my daughter said she loved it all, but I tasted her Smash fries and I didn't care for the herbs and spray of olive oil on them. Our granddaughter sleeps through it all, YES. They offer fry sauce, it has a horsey radish taste to it, not for me. Basically, my wife and didn't care for this new restaurant and our children loved it. For the money I could think of a lot of other places to eat lunch."}
{"text":"When we sat down at our booth to wait for our Smashburgers, I started reading the other Yelp reviews and then I got a little worried.  They are pretty mixed, so I didn't know what to expect!  I read one review that said the burgers were tiny and pancake like.  Another said they were covered in salt!  Both good reasons to be disappointed with a burger. 

Our food came & I was pleasantly surprised to see a good-sized burger (according to my standards anyway) and fries plopped down before my hungry face.  First of all, they got my order right which always seems to be hard to do for most restaurants. (I swear I'm not that asshole who sends everything back.)  I waited for my husband to take a bite.  He made that sound - you know the one.  The 'ohyeah,ivebeenwaitingforaburgerlikethis' sound.  & then I was relieved.  

My burger was pretty good.  The best burger I've ever had?  No but still good nonetheless.  I tend to like my burgers well done, so it was a little undercooked for my liking but I'm still alive, so a little bit of pink didn't kill me (that's what she said? ... Too far?).  I do think they should start asking customers their preference before cooking or just cook them through all the way.  The fries were good too!  My only complaint is that they are pretty pricey.  They are to directly compete with the Home Runs & 5 Guys of the World & definitely compare but I can cook a burger just as good at home.  Drop the price down to the $6-$7 range & I would be back a lot!"}
{"text":"First time to a Smashburger.... I didn't know what to expect but did expect better.  

No one asked me how i wanted it cooked and i like my burgers well well well well done... but then if Smashburger is thinking itself being on the same level as McDs etc that's OK as most other fast food don't ask you. 

I got my burger take out and when i got it back to work I noticed a lot of red juices flowing. from the wrappers, and living up to its name one side of my burger bun was smashed down.... is that a signature?    As I started to eat the messiest burger of my life i noticed that one side of the burger was well done and crispy, the other side not much and the middle was very rare and red..   I should have taken pics. 

I had the Arizona without Cheese and Smashed up Sweet potato fries which were oily but very good.  I will be back... as maybe this was a freak occurrence.  I know friends love other locations."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to a smash burger. I was pleased to see that there are options besides beef, namely turkey, chicken and black beans. I ended up getting the turkey with spinach goat cheese and tomato. Really fresh, juicy and tasty. The fries are skin on shoestrings however I prefer more of a steak fry the only reason I gave before instead of a five. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love fast food burgers, and this place is at the top of my list. Carl's Jr. and Jack in the Box have been in a burger arms race for the last couple of years and the quality of the fast food burger has only improved. These burgers are well done BUT they are so juicy and tasty. One Yelper criticized Smash because the burgers were well done, but this is not fair. Nobody should be eating medium to rare ground beef unless it is from a single fresh cut of meat and ground up just prior to frying. Under cooked steaks are safe to eat, but undercooked ground beef is not. I love Smashburger because they have Haagen-Dazs milkshakes and serve them in a thick shake glass with the extra bit in a cold steel cup, like they do in diners. This is a step or two above the average burger joint, and if you like diners and burger joints, you really should go see for yourself."}
{"text":"As a Midwestern ex-pat, I am overjoyed to have found a local option to replace my beloved Steak N' Shake.  There's just nothing like a good steakburger.  I had your basic cheeseburger on an egg bun and it was delicious.  I also tried the salted caramel shake and it was tasty but not outstanding.  Hubby's chocolate shake had a strange flavor to it.  We did not sample the fries but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite with a gf and my pup... they got our order in and the staff was super sweet. Its was my first time here, but wont be my last. She got an avocado chicken sandwich, I got an original cheeseburger, the smash fries were great. They made a woof patty for my pup no salt no seasoning. Again the staff was great. We sat outside, they brought us our food and adored my puppy too... great burgers omg huge chicken sammys too. Food was just what a burger should be."}
{"text":"Burgers were good but small for the price, biggest downside is one bathroom for each gender to share for the whole restaurant.  That includes the employees, spent damn near 15 minutes waiting for my 6 year old kid to use the restroom as we were in a line.    Not worth the hassle, had better overall experiences at Wendy's."}
{"text":"I have to say the burgers were quite delicious. The sweet potato fries were quite delicious, minus the one that had a strange herbal taste mixed with the cleaner and odd consistency that gave me food poisoning him for the next three days. I have not contacted smash burger about this today because I had surgery on Tuesday.  I wonder if the fryer was not cleaned out properly. Hopefully they will check on this if they read my review. I'm going to mark this up as to a fluke, and warn anyone to spit out any odd tasting food.  ;)"}
{"text":"Food- 4 stars, burgers are good, smash fries are great as well.  Service gets 1 star... been here several times and the service is always terrible.  Don't come if you are in a hurry or if you can't stand repeating yourself multiple times."}
{"text":"Suggested by a friend. Had the Arizona burger with fries. Good burger, Excellent fries!!! Could of ate a few pounds of the fries! Can't say anything bad but I love the hell out of my Lennys! Sorry"}
{"text":"I was calling in an order...had to call 3 Times to get someone. Then they told me to hold because there were 9 people in line... I walked in two minutes later since I was already on my way there driving and I walked right up to order. The guy lied on the phone. Totally ticked me off. It wasn't even busy in there. Hopefully the owners don't find out because they could be turning away customers all the time."}
{"text":"Smashburger is a place that aims to be a couple steps above Five Guys while still giving their diners a quick meal that can be ordered to-go when necessary. As a Five Guys fan, I was definitely all for seeing if Smashburger could complete with them. While I'd had a chance to sample Smashburger's menu before they opened, I'm in Monroeville so infrequently that it was months before I could return and enjoy a proper meal here. But finally I was in the area for Steel City Con - and I immediately drove here afterward to get my burger on. 

While Smashburger by design allows for people to take their meals elsewhere, I opted to sit and just enjoy my burger before I headed home. I ordered a burger I hadn't already sampled: the Avocado Club. Kind of a basic burger in that it just has avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, ranch dressing and mayo, but since I already knew what I liked and didn't like from the tasting event menu I was happy to go back to basics during this visit. And unsurprisingly, I liked what I got. The burger was fairly juicy and quite tasty, and the added flavor and crunch from some of the toppings mixed with the more creamy textures of the avocado and dressings made for a great burger overall.

I'm admittedly not that big on their thinly sliced fries, which were a little oversalted when I visited (but not inedibly salty). The problem I have isn't just that it's easy to oversalt or over-season the fries because they're so little - it also just gets a little harder to pick them up as you work your way to the bottom of a serving because the already tiny fries get even smaller as you go. Personally I like the bigger fries at Five Guys more. 

That said, this place DEFINITELY beats Five Guys side-wise. In addition to their straw fries, sweet potatoes fries and onion straws, Smashburger offers side salads and a side of cooked veggie sticks. It's a nice little thing that allows someone to make their burger indulgence a little healthier. Add in the fact that any of their burgers or chicken sandwiches can be made into full salads, and you can ask them to hold any toppings you may not like, and you've got a place that really can make for a relatively healthy but quick lunch or lunch on the go.

My final thoughts? I love Smashburger for what it is. While it wouldn't make my top burger place list, it is still extremely good considering that the place is meant to be a fast food kind of stop, and as much as I love a greasy Five Guys burger they definitely beat Five Guys with their healthier options. I'll probably pass on the small fries during future visits though. I certainly hope that I'm able to return soon, as I'd love to try a Haagen-Dazs shake one day and I still want to order full versions of all of the burgers I previously sampled. Here's to the next time I'm in Monroeville!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  Came in tonight and ordered the twin City burger. I asked if it was bigger than the regular burger and the cashier said it was the biggest they had.  It was not.  To add a soda and fries was $4.19 plus the $4.99 for the bigger.  I got hardly any fries and the burger was so small.  My wife ordered haystack onions. Very few haystack onions and dripping in grease. All we got was an apology.  So we waited a few minutes and decided $23 was a rip off and asked for our money back which they did refund.  Freddie's if so much better."}
{"text":"I'll start off by letting you this is not a fast food joint.  You can get your burger and fries to go, but you'll enjoy it much more if you eat in the restaurant.  This is head and shoulders above In and Out and Five Guys.

The menu has something for just about everyone, but it not too big.  I enjoy the Smash Burger most: Burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.  I guess it's probably a little overboard, but it's a great burger to have every now and then.  The fries are good, but I recommend the sweet potato fries and the smash fries (regular fries with evoo and rosemary).

If you're near this location or one of the other Smash Burgers, stop by.  You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"my first try with brand. burger came out really hot I loveeeee that- they win for delivering hottest burger to your lips lol.

fries super disappointing tho.so blah. not super hot like burger either.

burger good flavor good ratios good bread. no combo deal tho so all al la carte hence too expensive to make this a 4 star review. 

oh well decent. burger. anyway. pay up."}
{"text":"I tried Smashburger for the first time during my trip. It's okay, but somewhat pricey fast casual burger joints are dime a dozen these days, and while decent Smashburger doesn't do a whole lot to stand out, certainly not enough to justify the premium paid. The staff are nice and very helpful, and in that regard they get a leg up. The food is fresh but the quantity of what you get is very lacking for what you're paying. Pay the same price somewhere else for more food of similar quality."}
{"text":"Late night takeout dinner for the family on vacation. Read good yelp reviews so we decided to try given we were staying nearby. Family had two smashburgers, one truffle mushroom burger, one regular cheeseburger,  smash fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. Brought them back to the hotel and we dug in. Burgers were awesome,  flavorful, fresh ingredients,  tasty. Fries were good but small and few. same with the rings, which were more like onion straws. If you visit,  order the burgers, but skip the fries."}
{"text":"Easily one of my new favorite burger joints in the QC!  Located in Stonecrest Shopping Center. I got their Avocado Club Chicken with sweet potato fries, and hallelujah!! Such a mouthwatering goodness!!! I could just taste the freshness of the ingredients and the chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection! I've also tried their smash fries (fries tossed in Rosemary, olive oil and garlic), and although they were good, I still preferred the sweet potato fries over them. Definitely coming back here for lunch!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you love greasy burgers...soggy fries. I don't get the love for this pit. Just terrible."}
{"text":"I just received an order delivered by door dash. The \"big burger\" was barely larger than a slider and cost over $8...just for the burger. My salad was tiny...a side salad at best...for $8.90...a scrawny fashion model might call that a meal but no normal human would. Our \"bottled\" drinks for $2.52 were actually fountain drinks.  That would have been reasonable if it was delicious food, but alas, it was barely mediocre. In-N-Out is five times better for half the price.  After spending  $40 for delivery for two people, I'm looking for something else to eat. Smashburgee gets a double thumbs down!!"}
{"text":"I like most things about this place. The food is good and sometimes the service is OK. I would prefer the one beside the college. Service need a 101 training class or something."}
{"text":"Close to UNLV which is a plus- Good cheap cheeseburgers and I think it's better then in-N-out. Wish it was one in the spring valley area or maybe it is -(unfortunately I still don't know my way around)"}
{"text":"The cashier had great customer service. I ordered the BBQ bacon cheddar burger with smash fries. But when I received my food it didn't have any haystack onions and the amount of fries seemed small. I live for that burger when I come to smashburger so I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Great alternative to other fast food burger joints. They carry local brews. They offer healthy alternatives such as veggie frites and delicious salads."}
{"text":"Ordered fast and food came out in good time. Garlic fires are so good.!

They really mean they smash the burger when you get there. It was so juicy and delicious! Keep up the greatness"}
{"text":"The burgers are big enough to fill you up and with the \"create your own\" option I can get everything I want. (Although, let's be honest... aren't most burgers \"create your own\"?)

I suggest adding guacamole and buffalo sauce to your burger. Yummm."}
{"text":"Came back and I at least feel the burger is tastier. I don't think my Sin City had as much salt from previous times and I am all about the less than $10 meal nowadays. So here's another star!"}
{"text":"Smashburger for that down home Ikea feel.  I wasn't impressed.

Their menu is pretty standard burger fare...bbq burger, mushroom swiss burger.  I didn't see anything out of the ordinary in their offerings.  

I was excited for their sweet potato fries when I ordered them.  Wasn't so excited to eat them.  They were doused in olive oil and rosemary.  I'm a rosemary purist and don't think you are required to cook with a lot of it to get the flavor out of it.  Too much rosemary is a bad thing -- it overpowers everything and you lose the other flavors in translation.  

Their burgers were ok.  But lets face it, how hard is it to mess up a burger.  

I wish places would quit buttering buns.  I can't ever remember to tell them not to butter it and I think the butter actually mutes the taste of the sandwich.  

Smashburger wasn't my favorite.  Don't think I'll be dining there again.  

I rank it slightly ahead of Culvers.

Mad the mistake of going back here.  Hated even worse the second time.  Guess I'm just not a fan."}
{"text":"Great fries! There special Smash Sauce is just mustard mayo nothing special or creative and it's a little over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"SmashBurger, what's in a name like SmashBurger. On first consideration I thought maybe when you get it to go the drop the bag and step on it: SmashBurger. Or if you get it for dine in the drop your plate in front of you and provide bibs or something: SmashBurger. But certainly it would not be that they smash the burger on the grill, which would be unthinkable, right? Nope, that is exactly what they do.

Anyone who knows burgers knows that you do not smash a burger onto a grill. While you'll end up with a nice brown maillard (pronounced: my-yard) effect crust, this sear DOES NOT lock in juices. If anything it will make a burger taste greasy. If a seared burger is juicy it is because the juices have not had a chance to move out so eat it fast. Also, to get that crust requires a pretty hefty application of some salt so that should be considered. So a SmashBurger has to get on and off the fry surface fast otherwise there will be little left to serve. You will also notice how thin they are, this thinness is required for that speed.

Burger 101 Primer (for those interested): A 1/3 lb. burger patty should be 5/8 inch thick or there abouts (1/2 lb. slightly thicker) and applied to a lightly buttered fry surface (I like about 400 degrees). The rule is you flip your burger ONLY ONCE, hence knowing when to flip is key. Most chefs should shoot for medium rare or just medium doneness. For a medium rare burger you will make your flip when the first juices start to come to the top and run. Flip it and when that same thing happens on the other side you are done (first side is 1.5-2 minutes and the second side generally 30 seconds less). For medium you cook the burger until you see some blood with the juices, then flip and cook till it does the same thing on the other side (first side is 2-2.5 minutes and the second side generally 30 seconds less). In both cases the burgers should rest for a minute before plating. As for anything beyond medium, cook away. If you see totally clear juicy running you are medium well to well done. And if you cook it to where there are no juices at all, well, you have reached hockey puck. At no time do you ever press the burger (that only releases juices that are the goodness) or \"peek\" by cutting into the center to see how done it is. You will notice that this method does not require knowing temps and cook times, just what to expect as cooking a burger and this makes it very effective. Of course what is a burger without a bun.

When selecting a bun for a burger you should find one that is hefty enough for the burger you are going to slide into to it. Your average cheap market bun will be fine for your run of the mill 1/6 pound to 1/4 pound burger. Put anything larger on it and you risk the dreaded soggy bun (because we are looking for a juicy burger). For a larger burger find a bun that is stiffer and be sure to cut the heel thicker than you normally would. In any case, butter the bun lightly and put them open face down on the fry surface until it is well toasted. This is important because this crust will act as a barrier to keep too much of the juice out of the bun. When applying sauces (Mayo, Russian, Mustard, Catsup, whatever) they should be next to the bun (again, acting as a barrier from the hot juice of the burger.) 

Stacking your burger is an art in and of itself and I will let you experiment with your order for burger perfection. But, here is my stack order of a bacon cheddar burger with grilled onions: The heel of the burger, generous mayo, the burger, the cheese, the bacon, grilled onions, always light on the lettuce, a slice of tomato (optional) and then BBQ sauce on the crown bun. Oh that is a good burger. Notice how the flavors are stacked to meld, especially the mayo on the bottom where the juice of the burger mixes with the mayo to make a very tasty sauce. Burger 101 over.

So, we have a \"charred\" burger that is greasy (but that is not all bad) on a bun that holds up (this surprised the heck out of me because this is where most burger joints fail.) As opposed to other chains you can actually taste the burger (but eat it fast for best taste). The sides are slightly kicked up locally sourced product (US Foods, SYSCO (I asked)) which means they are not bad, but like everyone else so there is really nothing to write home about.

Apparently \"clean\" is in these days as the dine-in room was spotless and employees always looking to clean, very nice. And while the store layout is cookie cutter (with a few awkward pinch points in the traffic flow) it is pleasant. The noise level was more than acceptable and you could have a conversation without shouting.

One thing though, like a lot of these new trendy burger places you are going to need to bring some cash. My wife and I dined and the bill was $20.00, and for burgers that is a little high. Still, if I was in the area and wanted a burger for lunch or dinner I may well consider this place again and that should tell you something."}
{"text":"This location is the closest to my home so one day after work I stopped by to get my favorite burger, \"sin city\" the girl at the register was really nice & assisted me right away. I took a seat at a table to wait for my food as I had ordered it to go & when it was ready, one of the cooks (young guy) called my name so I began to get up & he literally dropped my bag of food on the table next to mine in a rude manner & turned away quickly. I was shocked by his delivery, I had fries in there & they went all over the place inside the bag. I ordered ranch with my food so I asked him if it was packed in there already just to be sure & he didn't hear me because he turned away so quickly so I asked again & he said \"yeah.\" So at this point I'm a little annoyed because my experience started out with 5 stars because of the friendly cashier however because of this cook, I'm giving this place only 1 star. I haven't even got to the worst part..when I got home, I opened the bag, fries everywhere! The burger was wrapped so poorly & messy it looked like a five year old packaged it. Oh and the ranch? It was about a QUARTER of the way full. In one of those 3 oz cups, literally enough to dip about 5 fries in. Idk what he was thinking giving me a ranch that isn't even HALF WAY filled. Take pride in your job kid!"}
{"text":"Smashburger (Avondale) = Yummy!! Definitely a place we will be returning to again.  

We went for the 1st time for lunch today and both of us (me & Wife) were very impressed.  Love my BBQ/bacon/Cheddar and she had the All American - both very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Smashburger certainly makes a tasty burger, though some of there other items wander a bit off point. I too was fortunate enough to get invited to the Sneak Peak event. I ordered the Spicy Baja burger, which comes with pepperjack, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle  mayo, jalapenos and guac (which I subbed out for garlic mushrooms), all served on a spicy chipotle bun.  My first reaction was that everything had great flavor. I really enjoyed the combination of fresh and creamy ingredients. I ordered the rosemary, olive oil Sweet Potato Smashfries and while they were quite strong on the rosemary I still enjoyed them.

Had I stopped there I would have given Smashburger 4 stars, no problem, and if you are just going to eat a meal that is probably what you will experience, but our table was given several other items to try. I guess they were trying to make sure we got a taste of the whole menu. The Brunswick fries were very salty and I wasn't crazy about them at all. The Harvest Salad was good, but it is heavily dressed and the blue cheese could use more kick (I thought it was goat cheese until I was corrected). I skipped the Chicken Avocado Club sandwich since I don't eat avocado or bacon and it had both. The Carolina Burger, which sports Pimina cheese, BBQ sauce and onion slaw, originally had me wary but it was tastier than I expected. I'm not sure I would enjoy a whole one as much as my order, but I would certainly split one with someone. There is no nice way to say that the Haystack Onions looked like someone dumped a can of French's on a plate, but the horseradish  sauce that came with them was pretty good. All of this was topped off with milkshakes and I don't have a bad word to say about those. They use Haagen-Dazs so it's pretty much luxury in a glass.

I think what it boils down to is that if I were going to catch a movie and needed to grab a meal (cause let's face it, I have no other reason to be that far down in south Charlotte) I would be more than happy to stop at Smashburger. I liked the things I picked (and some of the others) and I'd want to eat them again."}
{"text":"I like the food here; espicially the mushroom swiss. Best mushroom swiss i've ever had. The only downside is the price. A lot for a little. But you get what you pay for and it is delicious!"}
{"text":"I work Just around the corner and I swear to you the part I love about my job best is when the coworkers decide its an order food kind of day. Its always means Smash Burger. 

The burgers are out of this world tasty! And the fries... YUMMMYYYYYYY!!

the staff is always super friendly and helpful. They clearly enjoy their jobs! They get things going quickly and make sure you get everything you want or need! 

The only down side was they forgot the Avocado on my burger that I paid extra for but I am sure they'll remember next time! 

The decor is pretty sparse but the restaurant is very well maintained. 

I totally recommend this place. 150 million %!"}
{"text":"This is in terminal 4, 2nd floor, before you get through security.  I always stop here for morning flights to get the breakfast burger.  Egg, bacon, cheese, and hamburger. Can't beat it!  Much less crowded than the post security restaurants too."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger and this place didn't disappoint. Nice atmosphere, friendly service.  Burger was fresh and tasty. I also love their smash fries. I'm adding this to my regular list."}
{"text":"I was not satisfied with this location at all. The food was not the issue. There was a customer with a non service dog allowed to sit at a booth to enjoy her meal while making other uncomfortable. I am a dog owner but an eatery is not the place for them. The dog was sitting on the booth (not the floor) with its owner. There was a gentleman already in that area that left soon after she sat down. The dog barked a few times as well. Also the restroom was hideous. If the restroom looks this way what does the kitchen look like. It appeared that the restroom hadn't been tended it in a while"}
{"text":"I always like the food here, and today's lunch was even better than usual because of Will. He was running the front of house by himself, and simply had an amazingly happy attitude. He's a great ambassador for the brand."}
{"text":"I love that this restaurant is so close to my house! I'm typically reluctant to eat food from \"fast-food\" places but Smashburger is no McDonald's. The restaurant is noticeably clean and neat. The employees are undeniably friendly and helpful. Never have I went to this Smashburger and left feeling like I had bad customer service. There are plenty of space to eat or wait for your order to be sent out. You could even sit outside. I saved the best for last: the burger. Best burger you can get for the quickness of receiving it. They even have my favorite drink of all time - Coke Zero! That's a separate review in and of itself. I highly recommend this place over the larger chains. I'm willing to pay the extra dollars for a better burger."}
{"text":"Sincity burger was amazing it was very good , service nothing but good. Only flaw were the Buffalo fries over powered with spices of the Buffalo i was just nnothing but salt it was nasty sucks cause it ruined my fries but again burger was great ..."}
{"text":"If I go a week without going to Smashburger, it's honestly an off week. 

There is just something special about their burgers. My go to is always the bacon avocado club. Comes wuth bacon and avocado (obviously) and ranch drizzled on top. 10/10 for sure. 

Also, go with the smash fries. They're tossed in Olive oil and rosemary and SO good. 

Lastly, the shakes are amazing as well. I would personally recommend the butterfinger or salted caramel."}
{"text":"Management here is terrible. 
Sweet new girl still in training at the register. Wasn't trained properly and left up front while slow to take an order. Not sure the training processes but seems like there is none. Ask to speak to a manager, whom I guessing is all of maybe 17 years old, when I informed them that she needed help so we could place our order. There was blank stares. I'll save my $5 and go elsewhere for a salad."}
{"text":"Compared to most Locations, this one is definitely the quietest and cleanest.. The staff here are very friendly and accommodating . Burgers are mediocre, fries ehhh, but the shakes were so good ! 

The burgers weren't that great to me. Nothing great enough to leave a food imprint lol but can't complain too much, left with a full belly ."}
{"text":"Today was a huge disappointment! Online ordering for this location was down. Then they don't answer the calls and an automated service ends your call after stating that they are busy helping in store customers. So, I drove down, the doors were locked (7pm) and people in line opened the door for me. After the long line, I explained my frustration but the cashier didn't care. No manager was notified, no free drink, nothing. Probably the last time we eat here! There's way too many easier options in this area. Gotta treat the customers better!"}
{"text":"Got a flyer in the mail for the new Peppermint Crunch Shake. It costs $4.29, which seemed kind of expensive, but I love milkshakes and peppermint, so I thought I'd give it a try. Worst shake ever. It was very small, and was so runny, it was basically flavored milk with broken pieces of peppermint candy at the bottom. Total waste of money."}
{"text":"I've tried their smashchicken and smashburger, but love their smashfries.  Their burgers are tasty, but as a sucker for yummy fries... I go here mainly for those when I'm craving something salty and well, not so good for you - but definitely tasty!

They're usually pretty steady business wise, even in the off hours, but they manage to maintain a clean location that has pretty speedy service.  I'd have to say though that with a decent amount of competition close by (primarily being Zinburger), they still hold their own.  I think next time I'll try their salad instead though."}
{"text":"A good burger, but $1 to $2 overpriced.
Service was friendly and very efficient.
Delivery was fine.
Ambience is what you would expect froma low end hamburger place."}
{"text":"Expensive for a casual dining restaurant but I loved its contemporary look! The food was good quality food which explains the price I guess. And I had more of those yummy fries than I could handle! Loved the atmosphere and music tracks. And Keaira was very patient with me. A real sweetheart!"}
{"text":"The black bean patty was basically like a pile of refried black beans which was weird but acceptable. The topping were good and flavorful, especially the goat cheese, and I really liked the pretzel bun. The smash fries were really good. They were like thin, greasy fast food fries but had awesome rosemary flavor. The whole experience wasn't worth four stars, but I wish I could give it three and a half. I'd eat here again, but would prefer to try a black bean party with more flavor."}
{"text":"They prefer to close early and not make an order before closing. The worker Emmanuel was rude and insisted I just leave and that the restaurant was closed prior to the listed hours. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love the smash fries! Customer service could be better, the cashiers have 0 personality. It also takes a while for food to be ready."}
{"text":"Service 1 star
Food 1 star

Located inside Rio hotel on the 2nd floor by the entrance. They open late, so I got midnight snack.I have never tried their burger and ordered simple burger. My burger was  drenched with oil. 

The cashier put sign CASH only on register, so I paid with cash. Before giving my change ($1.90) back to me, she asked if I need it my change , I said Yes. (why wouldn't I)

While I was eating , I noticed the cashier asked a few other patrons the same question if they want their change back.

I guess the purpose of the sign\" Cash Only\" was for her to get cash.
I understand the work on fast pace and Do appreciate the workers but tips are gratuity. The approach wasn't right. 
And how did they messed up a burger with drench of oil. The bottom bun was soggy."}
{"text":"I ordered online which was really convenient.  The food was ready when I arrived.  It wasn't fresh but still somewhat good.  The fries were awesome.  This was my first time trying Smashburger.  If I opt to try then again, then I will probably dine in."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd location I have been to. And I must say it is a great concept/chain. But this is the worst of the locations I have been to (Tempe Marketplace location was marginally better). This spot was just depressing somehow and the staff and atmosphere here is a downer. Your experience may vary. Still a decent burger for sure."}
{"text":"Food was good the sauces they service with onion stack not so good...all in all great place for a great burger!"}
{"text":"With all the really good burger places there are in Charlotte, shame on Smash Burger for not at least making it look like they're trying. My burger was pancake thin and tasteless. And the onion rings were onion \"strings\" and broken and over seasoned. That will be my last trip to Smash Burger."}
{"text":"First time here and came during the lunch crazy with some work folks.  I have to say it was a very good burger.  I ordered the Avocado Cobb burger & added pickles & grilled onions.  The burger was super JUICY (messy burger alert - have MANY napkins handy) and had good flavor.  I had the smash fries with it which are super thin fries with seasoning on them - pretty good.  I sat inside to eat and went to use the ladies room before diving into the burger.  There was no paper towels to dry my hands so I informed the gentleman who was working the service window and he sent someone to rectify the situation right away.  While I was eating, the same gentleman came around to every table and asked if we needed anything & to see if things were ok with our food.  Super customer service for a small chain burger joint.  Their menu has salads and other types of burgers with \"free\" toppings like pickles, onions, etc. Stop in but be sure to have the napkins handy!"}
{"text":"Another complete order wrong last night-  AGAIN!!  Then ARGUED BY CHILDLIKE STAFF!!!!!    Run by morons & teenagers with less than grade 9 understanding of English or accountability. Time and time after time the orders are wrong and they stand there looking at you like you are the reason - the CUSTOMER!! ?? - which all in all = BAD USELESS MGMT!!!!

Do you hear me???  MGMT IS TO BLAME for your horrendous lack of consistency, quality control, accountability & inability to complete orders timely & correctly.  THE CUSTOMER IS ALL THAT MATTERS -  hiring people for 8.00 an hour has its continued consequences and this location has been a repeat offender since opening.  I suggest the franchise fire the mgmt. and half the idiotic incompetent staff immediately before this place just closes.

Hey Manager of the week - try hiring teens and twenty somethings are are NOT spaced out & incapable of LISTENING!!!!!!!   You cant get the order right when you - the dumb staff - and CONTINUALLY TALKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Stay away from this cesspool of clued out imbeciles."}
{"text":"I have only visited here once, but that is enough to keep me coming back - I'll be a regular for sure. The burger was delicious; cooked perfectly with just the right spices. The tomatoes, lettuce and avocado were very fresh and with good flavor. I had the best fries I have ever had! Served immediately, they were very hot and fresh with wonderful flavors from the rosemary and other spices. I can't wait to try the sweet potato fries next time."}
{"text":"I ordered the black bean veggie burger which was delicious and definitely tasted home-made but it completely fell apart after a few bites and was very messy to eat. I also got the lightly fried veggies which were AWESOME! I wish every fast food place had this healthier option! I would go back but probably not for a few months....I like my burgers to stay together when I eat them!"}
{"text":"Me and three friends Decided hey let's go have a burger. Our one friend decided he did not want a burger and went to Walmart and bought food and went grocery shopping when he got out of line and came back with his bag there were two ladies that literally took 10 minutes to order their burgers as he had already came back from Walmart. I was upset and very hungry so I went to Jersey Mike's and eight a foot long. Looking for one last loyal friend to Smashburger after I was done I see him finally picking up his order meeting us in the parking lot eating his burger in the car on the way home with the groceries and the rest of us after"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of hamburgers. But something about this place falls short. I can't quite put my finger on it. The beef is fresh but rare usually ends up being more medium which I am sure is for liability reasons. 

The rosemary fries are good, but not life changing like the girl tried to tell me. 

The ice cream shakes are great if you're not counting calories."}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.5 if I could. Overall, my wife and I had a pretty good experience when we popped in here on a Thursday night. The crew seemed to be on point and the food came out hot and quicker than expected. What originally drove us in was a coupon for buy-one-get-one free as this location is right next to our neighborhood. We ended up ordering a classic smash for me while my wife created her own with a side of tots. 

I ordered the classic burger as I want to compare the owner's suggested burger as a measuring stick against others I have tried. I was a bit disappointed as I felt this particular burger fell short of a lot of the other burgers around (both fast food more \"gourmet\" burgers). My wife's create-your-own had a lot more flavor going on, and I do like that you have the ability to customize your burgers with a wide range of toppings. What got me was the retail price of her burger was almost $9 for just the burger. Personally I'm just not a big fan of the product at it's price point. For their sake and because I think it is a cool concept, I still hope they do well in this location.

Other notes worth mentioning - the restaurant is pretty small (I probably wouldn't bring a group bigger than 4 or 6 here) and parking can be a bit tough with the small lot. If parking gets tight, park over next to Viva Chicken and it's a short walk over."}
{"text":"Come here often and the service is always great and fast. I always get the crispy chicken bbq, bacon & cheddar sandwich with smash fries. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"We go to Smashburger every other month or so. We do find their burgers, salads and fried pickles delicious! Friendly and efficient staff as well. The only thing that drives me  nuts though is that we all usually order different sides and they never come in the same basket as the burger/ sandwhich it was ordered with. I don't understand how this happens but it does Every Single Time! But we still go back because the food is great."}
{"text":"I've never been to another Smashburger location. This one has exceptional service, and it helps the burgers are delicious. We frequent this location and have yet to incur a bad experience. If you get a burger be sure to try the Smash sauce."}
{"text":"Smashburger is one of those things in life that you crave.....and once that craving hits, you can't shake it until you've satisfied the beast!!! love this place !!"}
{"text":"I really liked Smashburger in Vegas This location is okay, nothing to write home about. The classic smash burgers were satisfying. The beef patties are good.The service is quick though."}
{"text":"Ok so I went there today pretty early, just a bit past 10am. Yes an early lunch but it says both online and even on the doors they open at 10am. I got there maybe 1003am today, but both doors were locked. No worries, maybe they are just a bit late opening their doors. I went back to my car and sat there for a few minutes and I came back about about 5 minutes later, so maybe 1008AM or so, still no changes, both doors are locked still. I saw someone in there standing by the cash register. 

I had to go get my food at subway instead. Very disappointing when you go to a place of business and their doors are locked and it is past the time their doors are supposed to be open and there are no signs on the door giving any reason for them not being open. Not good."}
{"text":"This was only my second time trying Smashburger. I was not disappointed.

The \"build your own\" was awesome and my burger came out just as I like it. The shoestring fries were fresh and crispy, something that can make or break a classic 'burger and fries' experience.

My daughter and I each got a burger and shared a large order of fries. That was more than enough food for the two of us and we even had fries leftover.

The manager, Alex, stopped by our table to see how everything was. Great food & amazing customer service!

We will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time today. Overall the experience was pretty typical for the fast food industry. The service was fast and friendly. The Classic Smash burger was pretty good but smaller than what is available elsewhere for a lower price. The fries were typical of the industry. A \"combo\" cost me about two to three three dollars more than what the same meal costs at comparable restaurants. Drinks are served in a plastic cup so you can not get a refill and take it with you. When I could not get ketchup out of the bottle at the table I discovered (after just a bit of detective work) that it was a brand new bottle and still had the safety seal in place."}
{"text":"Smasburger is normally a great place for a burger, this location is terribly managed. I moved to Tempe 6mo ago and have tried this location a few times with the same result. The wait is ridiculous. The Chipotle next door typically has a long line but everything is in motion. This place looks more like a MVD."}
{"text":"Smashburger is a solid burger joint.  I'm a big fan of the Bluegrass burger, with its BBQ sauce, bacon, cheddar, and fried banana peppers.  The Windy City burger that they carried for a limited time was awesome, especially the pretzel bun it was served on.  They should offer the pretzel bun year 'round!  I tend to get their \"big smash\" burgers, as the larger patty really helps balance the burger to toppings ratio.  I'm also a big fan of their sweet potato fries, but they should come standard with their chipotle mayo.  I also tried the Nutter Butter malt on one occasion, and it was delicious and quite large.  As far as prices go, they could be a little bit lower.  My burger and sweet potato fries with a water usually comes out to $10.  It's still a better value than 5 Guys any day, and I always leave stuffed."}
{"text":"We visited your establishment on 7-30-17. I was extremely dissatisfied with your food. I paid 18.49 for 2 classic burgers... Your prices are way too high. Waited over 20 minutes for our food. We had also purchased your smash fries for 3.99 again way too high. You are just another glorified fast food restaurant right at the bottom of the list along with Mc Donald's. There were a total of 15 fries in the order.  Smashburger \"SHAME ON YOU\".  Never again will I visit another Smashburger....."}
{"text":"Burger too greasy...  Slow getting our food...  No clean tables to sit at...  Noticed a guy running around helping customers when he could have cleaned some tables guess he was too into waiting on a certain table than worried about the cleanliness of the restaurant he did score a tip from the table he was so into pleasing my BF said his burger was really good.,  I gave him my burger and he tasted it and agreed that mine was nasty...  The fries were good..  Prob will mark this place of my list.. Of no returns!!"}
{"text":"Been thee 2 times. Always a pleasure.  It live to your expectations. Good prium burger. Excellent special fries. I should go more!"}
{"text":"The others reviews seem spot on. Food was greasy but yummy. You can choose weird burger options but I think a more basic hamburger would have been better for my first visit, mine was too busy but I did enjoyed the egg bun.  I think there's 2 type of fries, smash fries were oily and salty, ill try regular next time.
I had the Sin City burger with a fried egg on it haha. Smash fries were pretty good but still nothing spectacular. End result, the food is good but it seems like you're paying for the gimmick :/
Just another fudruckers, johnny rockets, fatburger etc. All a little different but expensive for just a burger! No combo meal just a dollar off when getting fries with a burger, so everything is priced separately.

They also have Haagen Daas desserts which my girlfriend enjoyed, not something important to me though. I did like their selection of sodas, coke zero ftw

Staff was all over personality wise, some employees were quiet and standoffish, the counter girl was the most friendly. The manager used to work at Gordon Biersch I think. 
Seems like the business is too new, decor could be a lot better, eating area is pretty large but plain. I will definitely go back to see if it evolves or I like the plain fries,  burger / cheeseburger etc. just a hard choice with so many other options and create across the street heh"}
{"text":"Since the first time I visited this restaurant, I've never been let down. They deliver on the food & service aspect every time! Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"so glad to have a smash burger near home now!! I'll tear up a smashburger!!!"}
{"text":"They did not give me the metal cup with my almost $5 shake! If you are dining in and order a shake or malt you should get your shake glass and metal cup! I'll wait to go to Denny's for a shake next time!"}
{"text":"This is not a burger for the faint of heart.  Or those with heartburn.  Especially not the Arizona Smashburger.

I don't quite recall where I heard about Smashburger, but I recall it sounded quite exciting at the time.  Sadly, I'm not going to be able to be nearly as enthusiastic about it.  See, while the burger is good (much better than any of your standard fast food fare), there's not much to say beyond that.  The toppings were fine, fresh and crispy, which was quite nice.  The burger was very well cooked, so I know that the staff are capable of making decent food.  They do some fun things with having different types of buns for the different burgers, but when it comes down to it, there just isn't enough to make it memorable or worth recommending.

The side dishes, on the other hand, are memorable.  Just in a bad way.  Their fries were overly rosemary-ed and too oily.  They were almost slimy somehow and I couldn't eat more than one or two.  The onion sticks were better suited as a burger topping rather than anything that should have been served next to a burger.  Don't think they're onion rings in any way.  They are most certainly not.

If you're in Tempe and looking for a burger, check out one of the other places in the area that serve burgers.  This shouldn't be the first choice for burgers in the Tempe region."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger! It's pricer than In-N-Out but better than Shake Shack in my opinion. Their burgers are to die for! I usually switch between a bacon cheeseburger and the triple double burger, and they've never disappointed. My husband is obsessed with the truffle mushroom swiss burger, and gets it every time. The fries are pretty good, you can usually share a large serving with someone else. They're pretty oily though, but they sometimes stand their ground depending on the time of day. The shakes are kind of disappointing considering their price, but they're fun to share with someone else. You can expect to pay around $20 for two people when you share fries.

I'm no burger snob, but I know that this place is tasty and their burgers are high quality considering that this isn't a restaurant. You can definitely tell that these burgers are pretty fattening and not the healthiest thing for you, though!"}
{"text":"Horrible. My boyfriends burger was really pink. My turkey burger tasted like they poured salt on it. I wanted to try the fried pickles but could only eat 3-4 they were beyond salty. My 2 year old liked the fries that's why the 2 stars."}
{"text":"The most memorable thing here for me was the smash fries, they were delicious but very oily. The burgers were just as good and they take it to your table opened so you can add whatever condiments you would like which has the basic ones at every table. The service was good, very friendly staff and the food came out fast and still hot."}
{"text":"Great lunch today. I desperately miss the nutter butter shake but the new peanut butter shake is a great replacement.  My bunless burger and sweet potato fries were great as always. 

The smash staff was having a good time working together. The restaurant was really busy with local school teams and they were smiling and playing with each other. It was nice to see a great team of employees having fun. 

My only thing is I question their idea of a 1/2 pound burger. I make them at home and they're A LOT larger. I opted out of a double to get the 1/2 instead and got what I consider a normal burger. The line was far to long to get into again and order another"}
{"text":"Tried Smashburger for the first time and it was AMAZING. For a fast, but not too fast food burger it is spot on. I asked the cashier her opinion on what to get and she was kind and honest. I ordered the Arizona burger and was not disappointed. YUM YUM YUM!!"}
{"text":"I heard alot of hype about this new burger chain ao I finally had a chance to try it out.  Its supposed to rival In-n-out, Five Guys, the Habit, etc.  This place definitely gives it a good try.  There are many options for the burger and all ingredients are fresh just like their competition.  The egg bun was actually good and everything was fresh, but it just was not that memorable.  My friend ordered the 1/2 pound and I ordered the 1/3 pound.  His patty was not thicker, just larger in diameter which I thought was a bit weird, but I get that they are trying to be original.  Their fries were definitely a big dissapointment, not sure if they were fresh potatoes, even Mcds fries are alot better.  So all in all, Smashburger is good if you are in the area, but I def wont crave it with so many other better options available........."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. Here are my impressions:

Loved the atmosphere (much more so then 5 Guys)
LOVED the veggie Frites. So nice to know that you can get real, fresh,        veggies at a fast food joint. We went back and got a 2nd order.

Chicken salad was 5 stars for a fast food joint.

The burger was good, not great. Tasted slightly greasy. Bun was yummy.

I ordered the regular fries (supposedly like McDonald's original). They were ok. Could have been hotter. I guess I am getting spoiled by fries that are more like 5 Guys (fresh cut, skin on).

I had a coke float with Hagan Daz vanilla ice cream in it. Very generous portion of ice cream and I got to add my own coke and keep refilling as many times as I wanted. I thought that was awesome. 

My obvious comparison to 5 guys is because these are really the only 2 burger chains that are a cut above all of the rest. (Sorry In and Out, these 2 are better)

So, 5 Guys wins on the burgers and fries, but Smashburger wins in all other areas because they have ice cream, not to mention it is Hagan Daz, my favorite, milkshakes and more variety of food choices on the menu and a lot of those are healthy options."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place, finally went to try it and I had a mushroom Swiss burger, it was so worth it, I wish I had gone sooner.  Highly recommend these burgers you will enjoy these and the staff is friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Great food!! Had a classic chicken sandwich and it was delicious! Sweet potato fries were great as well. Wanted to try the veggie frites but they said they didn't have them, a little disappointed I didn't get to try them.. Next time!"}
{"text":"The burgers are quite good although a bit conservative and despite it not having a drive thru it feels like fast food. I would actually give them four stars if the quality of the food didn't seem to be hit and miss. I've had some burgers that just seemed off here and the fries are pretty mediocre and the smash fries aren't any better. 

I may be odd but it bothers me that some Smashburger locations do not have trash cans available for customers to clear off their own tables. It makes me feel like I have to leave a tip on top of jacked up prices for what I feel is fast food."}
{"text":"I have been to the smash burger a few times now and I was never disappointed. The food is always prepared fresh and the people are friendly. The Burgers are nice and juicy, the toppings are very fresh and you can do pretty much any combination you want. I would also recommend the garlic fries over the regular fries which seemed a little bland to me. But the garlic ones were crisp and tasty. They bring the food to your table and check in with you if you need anything else. They are a little on the pricey side especially after you super-size the meal which I recommend on doing if you are hungry. I also like the location conveniently at the 101 and right next to one of my favorite sushi places. A cupcake shop is right next door if you have a sweet tooth after your Burger."}
{"text":"It's great to have a place like this just across the street from where I live. What's not so great is that I'm sure my thighs aren't getting any smaller eating their food. 

For those of you who don't know Smashburger, it's a step above McDonald's and a notch below a gourmet burger from a restaurant. They're simply delicious. They offer a variety of beef burgers, bean burgers, and chicken. They also have salads and a bunch of different sides. My favs here are the deep fried pickles. Soooo tasty! They also have these flash fried veggies that are great for those of you who may be more calorie conscientious. The burgers are made to order, fresh, and only once you place your order. I like the make your own burger which allows you to pick your bun, sauces, and toppings. They offer 3 different sizes. A small is enough for me. The burgers are juicy and flavorful. Oh yum! The home made milk shakes are yummy. Big and creamy. What makes this place different than your average burger joint is that it also serves beer. You can't get that at McDonalds!

Service here is always quick and friendly. One time they missed one of my burger toppings so they actually gave me a free burger. This place knows how to treat customers right. I love coming here and will be back again soon.

If you haven't checked out a Smash Burger, you really should."}
{"text":"Devan is literally amazing. Last visit to this smashburger, they put our name down as \"marfel\" when my boyfriends name was Marshall. And they forgot to put in our sweet potato fries. We called and they wrote our name in some book, and devan was so apologetic and even hooked us up with a large fry and some other goodies. We will definitely be back to this location specifically, all because of Devan (and the amazing food). :)"}
{"text":"So not bad for the first time ever trying smash Burger food was okay Burger was a bit salty heavy on the seasoning salt the smash fries were a bit disappointing really didn't have much flavor on them but overall it was okay I might give this place another try."}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers, fries and onion haystack.... prices are a bit high and the place is always very crowded and noisy (good sign, I guess!).  I recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Bad costumer service. The employee that brought us our food was really rude to me and several other costumers. She slammed my food on the table when she brought it to me. Also, she got sassy with an older couple who said their order was wrong. Fix the costumer service."}
{"text":"Burger was hot and juicy! Smashed sweet potato fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Sooo yummy!! First time eating at Smashburger....tastiest Burger I have eaten in many years! 

My husband really liked the skinny fries too...I prefer thick cut fries, so I wasn't too thrilled about them.  BUT...I will go back to SMASHBURGER whenever I want the best burger in town :) You HAVE to check it out! 

P.S...I see in other reviews that the service was rated low....happy to report...the service was extremely good!!!!"}
{"text":"Great value for the money. Staff is attentive and friendly. It's a nice change of pace. Plus, they usually run specials that make it even more of a value"}
{"text":"I really like the burgers at this place, but they are a little messy. I can't seem to have a meal here without the onion straws-- they are a must! This location also has the Vitamin Water in the coke machine-- another favorite of mine. 

It is a nice, new, clean facility that is good for a fast lunch."}
{"text":"The Skinny: Great burgers however spotty consistency  (3), really slow service (3), value - a little more expensive than your usual burger joint but significant better taste.

I would have liked to give this place a four star review however the problem here has been the consistency of the food and service.

My hubby and I dropped in on the grand opening day and were floored by how juicy the burgers were. Like dripping in all the meaty goodness to the point where the bun was becoming over saturated. Although the wait is comparable to a busy In-N-Out,  wait staff were enthusiastic, helpful and eager to make your visit a pleasant one. 

Fast forward a few months later. On our fifth visit, the burger was significantly overcooked to the point of the having a hard crust on the patty. Not only was the burger a disappointment, the entree salad we ordered took significantly long time to come to the table. 

The wait staff apologized for the wait but said they needed to get it exactly right. (FYI, It took over 30 minutes to make a small salad with a fried egg and some bacon crumbled on top right. And the salad wasn't really anything special either.)

Other than the burgers, the chili isn't that much different from Wendy's chili - minus the kidney beans. The french fries are okay - the rosemary flavour is marginally better but not worth the extra cost. The sweet potato fries and veggie frites are too soggy and unappetizing.

Overall, I would recommend it for a good place for a burger but not much else. \"Choose your own burger\" frees you to get the toppings you want - including grilled onions."}
{"text":"My new favorite burger joint!! I got my (made to order) burger fast and it was better than I had imagined. Hot , greasy and tasted like a million bucks!! the service was great too!! when I said \"fry's\" they didn't mistake that for \"sprite\". lol   I am most def. a fan!"}
{"text":"The reason for the 4 stars is that I was really FAMISHED after I got out of the hospital for rotations. 
I paid $24 for 1/2 Classic burger which was supposed to be the Sin City burger, sweet potato fries, 2 milk shakes (chocolate and caramel which are made of Haagen Daz... YUMM!) and 1/2 Baja burger. And no, I didn't it all by myself. I also tried little bites of the Sin City, Mushroom burger and the veggie frites. Not too shabby. 
The service was great. This place is perfect if you're on the go because cooks are fast. 
This place can be compared to Steak and Shake at SouthPoint BUT not comparable to Bachi burgers in my opinion. 
Would I come back? Probably not as much since it's located at one of the busiest streets of Vegas."}
{"text":"4 stars for good tasting food and good service. Though my regular classic smash burger wasn't quite the 1/4 pound patty."}
{"text":"First time here. Last time here. The burger was pretty good. Tasted alot like a burger you would grill in your backyard. Toppings were fresh, fries were ok but hella greasy. Three stars based on portion size and value. The regular burger was tiny, the serving of fries was also tiny. A combo came in at just under 10 bucks. This place could do some financial damage to a family of 4. Not worth it. In-N-Out is better and a way better value at half the ptice. Keep your tiny Angus burger. When I leave, I  shouldnt still be hungry."}
{"text":"The burgers are very thin.  I did not like the Chipotle sauce. There is too much bread for the meat. Fries were good but a little oily. Service was quick"}
{"text":"This place does not know how to answer the phone 
I'm trying to call and place an order and no answers I guess I'll go somewhere else"}
{"text":"My daughter and I picked up a to go order and decided after we ordered to get a shake, while we were waiting by the kitchen door, as a worker opened it, we saw the floor was very dirty. As we waited, the manager was busy making shakes directly behind the hostess.  He spilled about 6 dollops of shake on the floor behind her.  We thought she was going to slip on it as no one made any attempt to clean it up.  The waitress sloshed around on the mess, I told her as I ordered the shake that there was a mess on the floor and to be careful not to slip.  She was oblivious to it.  Oh well, we ordered the shake, our burgers and fries were brought to us.  We waited a while and finally talked to the manager, he was rude and said oh you are waiting for the shake I just finished?  Meanwhile the our burgers were getting cold.  Our mistake for ordering after the fact.  We thanked the manager and he did not acknowledge us at all but just rudely put the shake on the table and walked away. We went home, our order was wrong, the hamburgers were wet, cold and soggy.  Never again will we go there!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town but not so much at this location. The burger didn't come out good and the fries tasted old and oily. Kinda gross.

Service was good. But that's about it. 

Actually, left with an upset stomach. :( 

It had to be the cook in the back.

I say that because we asked for a burger well done, and when the order came out it wasn't well done. We sent it back and it took over 10 min for the burger to come back out. Overall not so bueno."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in tonight's visit to the Eastern location. Our order consisted of a regular Smash Burger and an Avocado Club with an order of Smash fries. Order was placed with no problem however it took much longer for our order to come out than normal. Our smash fries were over done and  had visibly not been tossed in olive oil or any rosemary. We took the fries back up to the counter and asked for more rosemary. Employee took the fries and spoke to the cook. Cook then took the fries and basically dumped a quarter cup of oil and slopped a spoonful of rosemary on top. We ate our burgers but did not touch the oil drenched fries. I requested a refund for the fries and received my money back. This location has yet to get it right. Either too salty or too greasy. I'll stick to going to the Maryland location by UNLV."}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger.  Lover the Sin City burger and garlic fries.  Came here with my gf and she had the mushroom burger.  Both loved it.  Decent pricing for burgers and fries.  Place is well clean and servers and cleaners are friendly.  There's a self serve soda machine.  Bathrooms are okay, not the cleanest.

Parking is easy and place is easy to find."}
{"text":"Good place to get a decent burger.  Love the Sin City burger and the garlic fries  Can't always eat at In n Out.  Price is decent and the place is clean.  Seating is self-serve.  I usually find some coupon to sweeten the deals.  There's a self serve drink machine.  Servers and cleaners are friendly and nice. 

Parking is a plenty."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say thanks to both Iosha and Aime.  They were both friendly and on top of their game when the evening rush came in for dinner.

Keep up the good work ladies!

The Yes! Man"}
{"text":"Pretty crappy experience with this visit. The assistant manager with the bad attitude and hickies all over his neck started it off and the overcooked burger finished it off. Not sure what happened but this place has gone down hill fast. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Burgers are great but the salads are too small to make a meal out of. Sweet potato fries, regular fries, and veggie fries are great too. The veggie fries are super oily so I don't know if they are actually any healthier than regular fries, and the regular/sweet potato fries are more delicious. I don't recall there being any outdoor seating which is sort of a bummer, but it's still a good place to grab a quick bite to eat during the work week."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night for my first time.  I would describe Smashburger as elevated fast food, almost Chipotle like in design.  It was a very nicely decorated facility and the service was great.  A pretty expansive menu for this type of place.  A variety of burgers, salads, and other types of sandwiches.  A lot of sides are offered as well.  They bring the food to your table and have real utensils.  The downside of this place was the food was meh.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.  But what I paid for the food I really can't complain.  I can easily oversee coming here again, but if I'm in a pinch I will go back."}
{"text":"great burger look for the cook named big dom makes a real great burger. cooked just right.we will be back forsure!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. My burger was perfectly cooked and the spicy fries were great. The only criticism I would give is about the staff. They weren't the happiest crew if you get my drift. None of them smiled or seemed very friendly. If I'm paying $7 for a burger, you need to at least smile. :)"}
{"text":"They had great service,  quick,  I had the Arizona  burger , Patty is thin ,it was  on the salty  side , the jalapeños  were nice and warm, the guacamole  made a good combination.  Fries were a little  overcooked  and portions  were on the small  side. ."}
{"text":"Just wanted a snack before  the show.  Tried their bean burger it was so thin that it was crispy. The avocado and bacon helped with the flavor  but this was  inexcusable . Price was around 15. . Definitely  would come back"}
{"text":"This is really hard because I love their food, but I have just about had it. No matter what we seem to order, at any location in the valley, it is very rarely correct. Delicious, yes, but it's NEVER what my husband and I order. Tonight at this location wasn't any different. We paid for 6 $1.29 extras, 3 on mine and 3 on my husbands. I got 2 on mine, and he got only 1! He asked if I wanted to check before we left and I said no, but I guess we should have. Maybe I would have caught it, yet again, so it could have been fixed before we got home, like so many other times. I shouldn't have to worry about getting what I order/pay for every single time."}
{"text":"This was my first Smashburger ever, apparently they're in the \"higher prices but higher quality\" burger chain space also occupied by Five Guys, Fatburger, etc. 

Just for an idea, burger/fries/drink here is probably going to run you $10-12. I think the lowest meal price you can get away with would be around $8-9 for the smallest size of Smashburger, regular fries and a soda. 

You start by picking your burger size. I had one of their \"$12 for $7 coupons\" so I sprung for the largest bacon cheeseburger combo'd up w/ Smashfries and drink, which was just over $12 before coupon. For the most Bigly of the burger sizes, I was expecting a meaty patty akin to a small double cheeseburger. What I got was more like what I expected the \"regular\" size to be ... in fact the patty didn't even fill the regular-size bun.  The beef was also questionable, like when you buy high-fat cheap Walmart burger meat, mush it into a patty at home to fry in a pan and don't drain it off, and it comes out all fat-drippy. Regarding beef quality, their website says they use \"100% Angus\" but that's basically a meaningless marketing term (http://www.chowhound.com/post/angus-beef-marketing-term-642330). I expect $12 a meal for a good grass-fed burger, not so much Walmart ground beef. 

I know this is an individualized thing, but they do shoestring fries here, which are by far my least favorite of the french fry styles. The \"Smashfries\" upgrade is only 20 cents extra but I don't feel like it really improves the experience -- they're just tossed in olive oil and rosemary, which makes them taste more like a flavored potato chip. 

To conclude on a positive, the restroom is one-at-a-time and well kept. Also better seating environment than most fast food with a lot of high-backed booths.

tl;dr for an asking price of $12 I feel like the burger size and quality of the beef and the fries is just not quite there. It's a little better than the bottom-dollar fast food chains, but not enough to justify double or more the price. Opening up right next to In-N-Out is ... well, \"bold\" if you want to be nice, \"suicidal\" if you want to be brutally honest. I'm no big fan of In-N-Out but it's definitely a vastly superior value proposition with the quality not standing up here."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was great! The staff at the time was very friendly, our cashier was very professional and was very informed with the menu and was full of suggestions. The burgers are definitely not cheap but are very tasty! Totally worth trying out."}
{"text":"SmashBurger is um, well, awesome. They don't skimp here serving only the biggest, most mouth-watering burgers around.

 I like to go in and get the Sin City Burger. It's a nice, big 1/2 pound cheeseburger with a hot, sizzling egg mmmm. Drop in a side of Smash Fries (thin french fries drenched in olive oil) and the best chocolate shake you'll find in a suburb, and you're good to go. Maybe a Dr Pepper to wash it all down with too! 

 SmashBurger also serves up hot dogs and a few other options if there is something wrong with you and for some reason you don't want a huge wad of man meat in your mouth! 

 And please don't go here and try to compare this to In n Out across the street, they are two very different burgers, very different places. They each have their own incredible qualities. I take one star off for the little-too-steep price and hours, only open till 10pm."}
{"text":"Was craving a burger after hiking Charleston (and having a fellow hiker inadvertently drop a rock on my finger - OW!).  Smashburger was reasonably close and did the job.  It's not supposed to be like In-n-out, with the extreme cheap-valueness.  S-burger offers a wider menu and pricier ingredients, which may account for the slightly higher, but still relatively inexpensive prices (sweet potato fries! salads! nutter butter shakes!)  My classic burger was juicy and the ingredients fresh.  It was served with a smile and received with a bigger one.  Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Ok I get they are known for their hamburgers. And the ones we ordered today there were no complaints. HOWEVER,  I'm not the biggest fan of hamburgers so I opted for a crispy chicken sandwich. The toppings were plentiful and good, the chicken was huge but, and this is a big but,  it was cooked so much, I could barely take a bite. It was burnt, tasted like burnt breading and was greasy. Sorry but no more chicken sandwiches from here."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, and consistent. Definitely on the salty side, but once you're a few bites in you stop noticing. Not the best ever, but better than Bad Daddy's and Burger 21. Rosemary fries are good but the herb flavor gets to be a bit much after awhile. Nicest part is eating outside then letting the kids run around the fountain."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and they offer a gluten free bun. Staff is very friendly, great atmosphere. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Always good!   I love Smash Burger!! The girl who took our order was friendly,  the order was build your own,  it was perfect!"}
{"text":"UHG - this makes me so sad. I really don't like giving 2 stars but unfortunately this experience warranted them.

This Smash Burger is new to the neighborhood and my grandma wanted to give it a whirl for her Birthday lunch! I picked it up to take to her house because she doesn't like going out in this heat. I ordered two of their signature burgers with all the fixins' and one had no bun {just wrapped in lettuce} and a large fry.

I waited about 15 minutes for the to-go order and as I left I had a weird feeling that something was not right so when I got to my car, I checked everything out. My grandma's burger was SO saucy and somewhat soggy {they literally JUST made it!}, and my burger wrapped in lettuce was cold and had zero veggies or sauce on it - just the patty, cheese, and lettuce. The fries were also cold - like real cold. I'm SO happy that I checked! I went back in, waited another 5 minutes for them to add the veggies and sauce to mine and left. I didn't complain about grandma's soggy burger or the cold fries because I was hungry and didn't want to wait any longer. 

Anywho, our experience here was VERY underwhelming and i'm so glad that my gut was right and I checked in the car because I would have been so bummed if I had gotten all the way to grandma's and discovered this. I would absolutely choose In-N-Out ANY day not only because their food is fast, hot, and fresh and the service is friendly but it is also half the price. We won't be back here!"}
{"text":"First experience at this location was positive. Service was good and the burger was above average. It's a good overall value for what you get here. I have a few small complaints. When I visited the website prior to going, the pictures of the burgers all showed fresh sliced avocados.  When I ordered my burger, it cam with a ice cream type round scoop that was mixed like guacamole.  It was still good and fresh but not what I expected. I will go back again."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries at Smashburger are pretty much unrivaled in this area for the price. The food tastes fresh, the ambience is not your typical burger joint, and the food arrives fast. I suggest going on Mondays for free haagen-dazs milkshakes!"}
{"text":"What is the big deal about this place?  Got the burger, didn't find it to be anything special, and very greasy.  Service was just OK and the place seemed to be filled with inattentive parents (kids running all over the place, and the kids at the table next to us decided to throw rocks at each other).  Pass"}
{"text":"Last time for this neighborhood joint. No jalapeños on our previous visit, and couldn't get waited on this time. We left and went across the street. When are local restaurants going to understand that they only get three strikes?"}
{"text":"The food is really good, but we had one big complaint.
We tried calling their phone to order take out ahead of time, and it was constantly busy. We decided to drive down and make the order at the shop. The line was long, and we decided to try calling again, to see if they picked up the phone. We STILL got the busy signal, but THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE KITCHEN USING A PHONE. We're starting to think that during their busy rushes they keep the phone off the hook to avoid taking phone orders, because this is not the first time we haven't been able to get through on their phone. This is a horrible business practice."}
{"text":"Went here 2 times, the sweet potato fries rock, don't eat beef, so had the chicken sandwich club with avocado no bacon, pretty good.

My biggest problem is that the 2nd time I went was around 2pm and all the tables were dirty.  No one in the restaurant, couldn't they have cleaned the tables and the floors?  We finally found a clean table to sit at.  Makes me wonder about the kitchen?"}
{"text":"I didn't eat in (ordered to take out), but I was very pleased with Smashburger overall! The Sin City burger was delicious, fresh, tasty, and I LOVE the bread. The sweet potato fries were also good, but jeesh, they don't give you very many of them! Yes, this is going to be a bit more expensive than going to Burger King, but it is worth the extra couple of dollars. 

All of the employees were very friendly and polite, and they make sure that your bag contains all of the necessary condiments to enjoy your meal. I'm glad that there is a Smashburger so close by!"}
{"text":"This was awful! The order is completely wrong! Items missing. Their postmates menu has items that are no longer on the menu. Such a waste of time and energy. Patty is salty, and theres maybe 3 of the thinnest slices of mushrooms on the mushroom burger"}
{"text":"Not sure if the management has changed, but the customer service has gone way down hill. There was no line and 3 people behind the counter when I arrived. They saw me, but then finished their conversation before greeting me. I had placed an online order an hour before hand. They were totally unprepared and again not busy. They asked if I had already paid for it and if I had a cup. Is bringing your own a new thing? I had to wait for the food and was not told \"you're welcome\" after saying thank you to either employee I interacted with."}
{"text":"If you don't know how or what to order, this can be a pricey little burger. However, play your cards right, and this will be so worth it! I think the best bet is to do a build-your-own burger. A regular size is plenty big, unless you have a huge appetite. Any of the sauces and veggies are free and you can choose as many as you want. Cheese and toppings like bacon, avocado, grilled mushrooms are extra, from $0.70 up to over $1, so choose wisely.

Personally, I do goat cheese, lettuce, grilled onion, pickles, tomato and smash sauce. Instead of the standard thousand island/ketchup mayo combo/In N Out spread, their signature sauce here seems to be part mustard, part mayo. Doesn't seem as heavy, so I don't feel AS bad eating a burger. I shouldn't be anyway. My doctor said my cholesterol is high....

Anyway, compare this burger which is less than $5 how I have it to, say, In N Out across the street? It's different, larger, and def more options. But say compare this to a much more pricey burger at Ruby Tuesday or Red Robin? Blows them out of the park! Less than half the price of those sit down places, and tastes way better too. Plus service is much quicker, and for cheapos like me, you don't really have to tip unless you want to.

Now if you get chicken, this is where it gets pricey. Around $7 for a yucky grilled chicken breast sandwich, and if I'm going to get a fried chicken patty, well may as well just go all the way and get the damn burger! And the salads? Who the F goes to Smashburger and gets a..... oh that girl over there. Anyway, if you want to add a protein, it's an extra $2 on that. For me, it's an easy choice.

Place is always clean, staff is friendly and patient, and parking is easy to find."}
{"text":"We come here almost every day after the gym. The crew here all know us by now, and it's gotten to the point that if they aren't that busy, and they see us parking and getting out of our car, they already start on our order before we even get inside! Many times as soon as we have sat down with our drinks, our food is ready for us. Talk about service! Our order is always the same, but they know our special modifications, and I can't remember them ever getting it wrong. I even started asking them for just one side of dressing for my salad since I only use one and felt bad about them wasting the other, and now they even remember to only give me one side of dressing.

Speaking of their salads, they're actually quite good, and the grilled chicken is always moist and tender, and I don't even like chicken all that much, and esp not chicken breast! Whatever they do to their chicken, it's good. And the chicken sandwiches are a much healthier alternative to the burgers and yes they are filling and satisfying. According to their website, the salads and sandwiches with grilled chicken clock in at about 500-600 cals.

Get their Bogo coupon from the Smashburger website, which they keep extending the deadline, so it's a great deal! And don't forget to sign up for their Smash Club for free sides and entrees (they add up quickly)."}
{"text":"I have been to Smashburger a few times and have even ordered takeout. I will never dine IN again after yesterday's experience. 3 out of the 5 back booths were dirty with trays of food and the floor was also dirty. Yes, they were short staffed and finally a manager appeared but she should have taken over. Our server  was Akexandra and she looked miserable to work there. The burger was still tasty. I always get the \"sin city\" burger.The vibe has definitely changed :( Bachi Burger across the street wins."}

{"text":"Very good burger joint.  Quality fresh veggies and burger.  I like it more then 5 guys.  The best part is they put effort into the fries, many options to chose from.  Sets them apart from their competition."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today.
After staring at the ketchup splattered on the wall inside my booth, my small-sized \"food\" finally arrived. 
I had the Black Bean \"Play-dough puddy-patty\" with lettuce, tomato and avocado. 
All I can say is, it's not going into my

{"text":"Bad burger. Mostly mustard and cheese. Tiny beef patties. Server said it was normal though."}
{"text":"Underwhelming and a bit overpriced... Not bad but certainly not the lifechanging holy grail of burgers I expected after so much hoop-la.  The fries are the standout but I imagine they are even better if you dine in."}
{"text":"Went to Smash Burger last weekend and the food was delicious! I have a sensitive stomach and after eating a full veggie burger and 1/2 order of the rosemary smash fries I still felt great, not like when you have a burger and fries at other fast food joints. Prices are competitive but my boyfriend and I each had a burger, and shared the fries and drink and it was still around $20 - a bit much for sharing the fries and drink, I think... that's why I only gave the 4 stars. However, I would definitely recommend this joint! The service was also great, someone came by our table when we were finished eating and asked how everything was, took our trays and everything! I'm glad we now have a Smash Burger in Calgary :)"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Saturday evening for some dinner. We tried a Spicy Baja Chicken sandwich, a Classic Chicken sandwich, a milkshake and a rootbeer float. The Spicy Baja was definitely spicy! You can semi-regulate the spiciness be removing the jalapeños that are in there, but be ready for a long-lasting burn. Basically, the chicken was pretty okay. I'd say on par or better than most chicken sandwiches at fast food joints. The milkshake and rootbeer float were both very good."}
{"text":"Most people have heard of Smashburger, so this review will be short and sweet.  Every time I've visited a Smashburger location, my burger has been tasty, hot, and smashed thin, per the name.  I always get a yelp check-in discount, which is a perk, and service is usually good.  Smashburger is a little higher-end than most fast-food chains, as the ingredients used are a bit nicer and the quality of the burgers higher.  This place is good for a cheap burger fix that won't make you feel too guilty about indulging."}
{"text":"5 stars for the dark haired man working the cash register. I'd buy a truckload of burgers and fries from him any day. I don't think he would fit in my take out bag.

Yes, great restaurant....excellent service, clean & organized restaurant, and great tasting food!"}
{"text":"4 starts not for the food, but for the ridiculously long wait. It took almost an hour from the time we walked in the door to when we were finally given our food. It was my first time, and luckily my colleague and I weren't in a hurry (but usually we are). May not come back to this location for lunch without pre-ordering. Invest in a new POS system (the young man did a great job vamping like a standup comedian to compensate but good God it took forever to run my debit card!!), and staff more employees during your lunch rush, por favor! Burger was good, fries were dried out, but my coworkers tell me that's an anomaly."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple more times since my terrible experience back in December. The speed and quality of service is more up to par now with other Smash locations, however, this location still screws up more often than others in my experience. Just the other day, I ordered some salads to go and when I got back to work, the salads and utensils were in the bag, but no salad dressings! 

Be sure to check and triple check your order here before leaving! Also be sure to check your receipt after paying. They've also charged us for the wrong items before: for example a Harvest salad when we ordered Baja Cobb. Tell them immediately to avoid confusion when the food comes out"}
{"text":"OMG!! Hubby and I were sitting on the bench waiting for our to-go order when an employee went through the door to the kitchen and we could see all the way down the floor was FILTHY!

If that's ok with this place, what else if ok to leave dirty?!!

We cancelled our prefer,got our money back and left! Sitting in car now...still starving!  

This is extra dad because we love Smashburger...it's our big-calorie treat once in a while. This might have cured us both!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a burger so I thought to give SmashBurger a try. I base most of my reviews on the service and the experience.  Bottom line, I have 4 starts because I was not greeted in friendly way when I gave my order and the fries were on par with Burger King; they were not so great. However, the burger, the reason why I came in for, was awesome!  Strong beef taste and a great bun. For that reason, I will come back. 

It's ok to greet people with a smile. Just saying. ?"}
{"text":"My first time to a Smashburger joint, and boy was I impressed.  I really wish this chain was where I live, near Seattle, WA.  A really good burger, fries, and a soda manages to stay under $10 (at least here in Mesa, AZ).  What makes Smashburger a cut above the likes of Five Guys and Fatburger?  It's one word - FRESH.  Everything with the burger is top quality, fresh ingredients.  The Arizona Burger had delicious and fresh tomato, onion, avocado, and chipotle mayo.  You can tell the burger patty is fresh and probably hand made, and the egg buns are great.  The fries are also a special treat, with olive oil, rosemary, and garlic.  Yummm!

Smashburger is truly \"As good as it gets\" for a burger joint!  Fatburger and Five Guys make pretty good burgers, just not as good as Smash... and only Five Guys comes close in the fries category."}
{"text":"One of the better burger chains. I've been to them in Las Vegas as well as Sacramento... and I've found several items on the menu to be consistently good. Yeah, it's a burger place, but check out the salads and chili as well. Haven't found any major faults here."}
{"text":"Good lunch - got the black bean burger on whole grain roll, with sweet potato fries. The fries were absolutely awesome, and the \"burger\" was good - a little too spicy for my taste, but good nonetheless. Great, friendly service. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Sin City burger and buffalo chicken sandwich are great. Not big portions, which im fine with and fries not included. This is a great fast-casual spot that offers Vegas's own Joseph James beer! Our of everything, Kennedy was what impressed me most. Grade A customer service to not only my table but every other one there, funny and genuine."}
{"text":"We usually visit the location on Maryland but this one is a lot closer to our place so we decided to give it a try. 

The food was good as usual we ordered our typical Sin City Burger. I was caught off guard by how great our service was. I mean it's typically in and out but I have to say the closing manager was super friendly and very welcoming making it the best experience we had at a Smash Burger."}
{"text":"This place has been here for awhile now. But,  I have never been overly impressed with them.
Friends wanted me to give them another try, they think they are good.
The fries seem like they would be good. However, after you eat a few, you are just done with them. Your tatse buds are saying eeee, that is enough.
However, I did like the burger that I got, it was nice and hot when I got it as well.
The Truffle Mushroom Burger was my choice today, though I did not get the mayo on it . I do not like Mayo for any reason.
High price, not too bad , but still not my favorite."}
{"text":"Took the family for dinner. Waited in line to order for over 20 minutes. Took another 25 minutes to get our food. Fries were barely warm when they came out and very small portion. Sonic has better tots. The tots were a very small portion for the price. My food came several minutes after the rest of the family. $40 for 4 of us. I ordered the\"Big Classic\" for a higher price than the classic but couldn't see the difference in the burger. Cost is way too much for what we got, and the burgers are little. Very disappointed! Should have gone to Whataburger. I don't see what the hype is. Not impressed."}
{"text":"My burger was good.  However, it cost almost $10 for a burger and soda with no sides.  This is a fast food, order at a counter kind of restaurant.  For a little bit more I could go to a sit down restaurant and not only have a waitress serve me, but also get some fries to go with that."}
{"text":"Our first visit to SB was today and I have to say that the burger was outstanding! The burger itself was very flavorful and juicy. The fries...ehh not a fan and I won't order them again but my hubby and I agreed that we will both be back for the burgers. The staff was awesome and went out of their way to be helpful!!"}
{"text":"Hello, gorgeous! Love the smash chicken and service with a smile. 
Food and service are great."}
{"text":"The food here is typically pretty good, so I wanted to make a Togo order tonight. I called and they told me that they're unable to take orders on the phone after a certain time. That's fine, I understand policy. I ask if I can place my order online and was told I could. 15 minutes later, the order confirmation screen pops up and says that my order will be ready at 11am the next day. That's weird, so I call and explain what's going on to make sure that when I get there it'll be ready. They tell me that unfortunately after a certain time it's against their policy to take phone and online orders, and my only option is to come in and place the order in person. I ask to have my online order cancelled so that tomorrow, they won't make an order that I'm not going to be able to pick up, and make sure that there's no way that they can either look at my one hamburger I wanted on my online order or take it verbally by phone. They say no, and I really don't want to spend any more time on this, including the wait time I'll need to spend in the store for them to cook it. So 30+ minutes spent trying to order/ordering/on hold while the manager cancels my order (who, by the way told me my credit card would be refunded in 2-3 days, with not a bit of \"sorry for the inconvenience\" attitude for the whole misinformation thing). Pretty dumb. Probably not gonna come here again due to poor customer service."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. This place is super delish! I love a good burger place and this one has a great variety. Plus, serves beer! Yes, please. Sad it took me so long to try it. Definitely a new place to add to my cheat-day menu. If you've been thinking about checking it out, take the time to do so, you won't be disappointed.

Price - slightly above your average burger joint, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Went at 1am to smash burger and God was it good..I recommend the sin city big smash burger and a vanilla shake.!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a very long time. so I order the sin city Burger  sooo good I love the caramelize onions just hits the spots. Everyone that works there are very nice. One of them name is Robby he gave me excellent customer service by letting me know that if I needed any thing he will be at service and he also checked up on me on my meal."}
{"text":"What a ripoff!!  I placed an online order that included a Baja Salad, which was expected to be a dinner entree.  Imagine my surprise when it was the size of a SIDE SALAD for $8.09!!!  I said \"this is the full size salad?\"  and was told that they are much bigger if you dine in!!!  A complete ripoff.  There is no way that is enough for an adult for a meal.  I had to stop someplace else to get something to augment it for dinner!  You know what they say - fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice shame on me.  Well. they won't fool me twice.  They will NOT be getting any more of my business!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I eat here frequently and I can't say we have ever had a bad experience. The food is reasonably priced, tastes great, and gets to the table quickly. I feel as if there are always good workers who greet us with smiles and make sure we have everything that we need. Tonight our food was brought by a man named Bevan, he was great. He made sure we had everything we needed and made sure we were happy with our meals! I am very impressed with the service and we will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"Formed in 2007 and now at something like 200+ locations it's similar to Five Guys Burgers & Fries but the burgers aren't as greasy, most toppings are free, the sides are delicious and the buns out of this world fresh!

The concept is simple- create a fast(er) food restaurant where the burgers taste as good as you would make at home, if you had the time and all the ingredients/accoutrements at your fingertips.  That's what Smashburger is.  They've tried to position themselves above Wendy's but below Burgatory.  The term Smashburger comes from the fact that they keep the ground meat fresh and 'smash' it on the griddle when you order it.  It's not a round or square frozen patty cooked hours before you order it.  It's also not a 1/4 Kobe, 1/4 Wagyu, 1/4 bison, 1/4 elk, 1/4 ostrich, 1/4 emu... wait- that's too many quarters...  It's a ball of USDA Certified fresh ground beef cooked to order- just like you would do at home for the reasonable price of $6.39 per burger.

The menu lists 5 different types of burgers but from the way GM Ron was talking about it- you could create any kind of burger you wish.  My fav was a pretzel bun (delicious pretzel type outside but fluffy & delicious inside) with bacon, blue cheese crumbles and bbq sauce.  My least fav was the one with mushrooms, swiss (I think)and Truffle mayo, as I'm not a fan of Truffles, but no problem- you can order it with regular mayo.  

As for the sides- in order of fav to least fav- the sweet potato fries were delicious, the onion 'straws' were tasty, the shoestrings pretty good, the fried pickles were lightly breaded and still had a 'snap' to them (even though I'm not a big fan of them so I can't really judge) and I gotta agree with Amin in that the buffalo fries were too salty.  All 3 of us turned them away.  So- I'm sure you could order 'Light Seasoning' on the buffalo fries and they would be much better.  

A few things I didn't like were the ranch dressing and the bbq sauce.  The Ranch was a boring, all too served, Sysco type mass produced blandness.  For as much effort as they put into their burgers- they dropped the ball on the Ranch.  And I have no idea who taste tested the bbq sauce but it wasn't a Pittsburgher.  We like our bbq sauce thick, sweet & tangy and that sauce was thin & tart.  I would prefer them to swap theirs out with Sweet Baby Ray's and my burger would have been Off The Hook good...

Almost forgot...!  They sell salads... and they look DELICIOUS...!  We didn't sample them but they looked SO GOOD that I almost asked for one to take home.

I rated them 5 stars as I feel their awesome efforts far outweighed the couple things I didn't like, or maybe it was just my tastes, but I feel Smashburger will be a 'Smash' in Pittsburgh and I'll be stopping in every time I have business up in Monroeville."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Arizona Smashchicken. (sans onions)

Really fun burgers and the staff are well-trained to smile and say nice things to you. (If they don't, just punch them) Top it off with a great milkshake and you're arteries will never be the same. They gave me and the missus a free chocolate malt just so they could see us drink it together sharing straws."}
{"text":"Smashburger is just what it sounds like.  The burgers are smashed.  So medium rare, medium, medium well doesn't matter here.  It's a thin piece of smashed meat.  I tried the burger once and since I like my burgers thick and juicy, not thin and fried, it just wasn't doing it for me.

However, I did recently come back to try the smashchicken and that actually is pretty good.  I went with the crispy avocado club.  The bacon is pretty tasty and I got it with guacamole instead of avocado which gave it a little more spice.  Their guacamole is a little too tangy for me, but the crispy chicken had a good texture and was juicy despite being smashed. The multi-grain bun it comes with tasted pretty fresh.

I avoid the smashfries because they tend to put too much of the olive oil, garlic, and rosemary seasoning on them, making it a puddle of olive oil with some fries in it.  Save a few hundred calories and just get the regular fries.

Service here tends to be slow.  It takes a long time to place an order.  I don't know if that has something to do with the customers because once I get to the front of the line to place my order, it goes pretty quick.  It also takes a while to get the food so don't plan on this being a quick takeout joint."}
{"text":"The burgers are above average. They are better than Five Guys, but not better than Red Robin type burgers. I like how you can pick between a bunch of condiments and the burgers are pretty big. 

The staff is friendly but not overly friendly. During peak/ packed days, you may have to look for a seat or wait for one. :Last time I had to sit outdoors. I'm usually patient, and I like sitting outdoors, so this doesn't bother me too much."}
{"text":"Great food, very clean, and the staff is amazing. Always very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Smashburger is one of my favorite burgers because I find it to be tastier than most burgers out there. I like this new restaurant a lot for the same reasons I like the other Smashburger establishments - tasty burgers, friendly and efficient staff, bright and clean interiors and exterior, a comfy patio area for al fresco dining. Great location too, in a shopping area that is not too busy so that parking is not a problem. I guess my only \"complaint\" is that it is only 2 blocks from my gym, making it hard to resist when I pass by hungry after a workout ;)"}
{"text":"I like their burgers and smash fries just as much as any other great burger joint in the valley; however, the reason for the five stars is their excellent Customer service! I called the restaurant at 9:55pm to see what time they closed, and they informed me that they close at 10. I told them maybe we will stop by next time since they were almost closed, but this gentleman offered sincerely to take our order. He took our order over the phone and we were there in 3 mins. When we got there they greeted us with a smile, and not even once, did we ever feel like we were a bother. They treated us with respect and kindness; and because of this reason, I will continue to come and eat their burgers/fries over any other burger joint around! The only regret is that I didn't get the kind gentlemans name; because he sure showed exceptional customer service tonight, and I really hope he can get the recognition he deserves! Thanks sweet guy, you made our night!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time & money on the shakes. It took forever, small for $4.38, and they \"hand spun\" the thickness out of it. It was grainy chocolate milk. 

I am beginning to think that we ate at a completely different place than other reviewers. We actually threw  a lot of the food out. Burger was awful. Rubbery chicken sandwich had been cooked on same griddle w/ burgers. Even had burger scrapings on it and the bottom bun was so soggy I couldn't eat it. Beyond disappointing. I usually give places a 2nd chance, but not this time. Sorry."}
{"text":"Raven had terrible customer service, she seemed like she would rather be anywhere but at work. Definitely needs work on her people skills."}
{"text":"Food is always hot, fresh and delicious! Service depends on how busy they are, but is usually great! Our order is always correct and shakes/malts are made fresh, not out of a machine! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a burger and fries joint so it's going to be greasy and terrible for you. I don't understand all the negative reviews that cite grease as a problem at Smashburger. The food is fresh and made to order and is not any more greasy than any other burger joint, bar or restaurant I've been to. 

I usually get the Sin City which comes topped with grilled onions and a fried egg. Most burgers can also be ordered as chicken sandwiches as well. The burgers here are pretty filling, although can be considered pricey for fast food since a standard order doesn't come with any fries or sides...add fries and/or a side and you'll probably have too much food, as I'm typically leaving here feeling super stuffed. 

The staff here is friendly and patient so you can take your time reading the menu if you've never been here before. If you get a salad, try their chipotle dressing, which has a tasty and unique kick to it."}
{"text":"Stopped by today after hitting up Town Square and grabbed a cobb salad w/ chicken to go. Been to many other Smash locations in the valley and haven't been disappointed with one until now. First off, the employees are kind of clueless here which drags out the ordering process.

The salad looked the same as usual at first glance but after I left the store and later tried to eat my salad, I realized they hadn't included any dressing. Really? I'm sure they just forgot but I'm now left with a salad that can't be eaten. If I had gone home that would be a different story but I didn't and was still out, which means there is nowhere to find salad dressing. I'll he back to Smash but not this one"}
{"text":"The salted caramel milk shake is AMAZING!!!!!!!  Worth every calorie 

The fries were not greasy.  They were crispy  

The actual burger was moist and all the veggie toppings were super fresh

Great place for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"On first impression the place was clean. I ordered the jalapeño Baja burger, sweet potato fries and a peanut butter shake. 
It says they smash the burger flat to lock in the juices except smashing it has the opposite effect. The burger was cooked very well done! It was as thick as my phone of course it's going to be well done so you can't get it any other way. Fries were decent small order for the price and PB shake was good. The bill came to $15+ and I was still hungry afterwards. 
I only came because I had a gift card which still has 9.68 remaining.  I guess I'll be back again to finish off the gift card but not after that.
To tell you how excited I was to come here was I got the card in February and it's now August."}
{"text":"We've been here several times, my kids love it, my husband loves it, I love it! It's so good, my kids forget they are not getting a toy or prize with their meal :P
Place is very casual, staff is friendly and helpful, and the food is so good!!
Usually in our order we include the kids smashburgers,they are so simple, but so buttery good! with their side of fries that always have enough to go around, however, we like the sweet potato fries, and the smash fries with rosemary and oil!!
Husband always orders the Arizona Smashburger, with jalapeños, onions and guacamole! Me, I'm always trying something different, from the Arizona, the regular Smashburger, I also had the Chicken Buffalo smashburger, both grill and crispy, but this time it was not on the menu... I miss it! So I tried the Truffle mushroom with Swiss Cheese... it was so good!!
So, go, skip the square burgers and head to smash burger!!"}
{"text":"Seared burger patties. Mouthwatering. Garlic Rosemary fries. Hold me back. I might start eating this review.  I love the industrial interior. The vibe is even delicious itself. Great customer service - for the most part. I come in here a lot for my lunch breaks. They're good at maintaining cleanliness. 

 But one night, for dinner, the service was super slow. I'm mean snail trophies all around. My order was just sitting at the counter for 5 mins. Total of 15 mins. They guarantee 6 min wait. I can tell the difference in management from lunch and dinner. Can I expect consistency please."}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings going in but left knowing that their yet another solid option comes too gourmet burgers in Vegas!  I find it ironic that Bachi Burger and Smashburger located basically kitty corner too one another. I had too go with the Sin City Burger because who would not love burger with fried egg?? I did leave out the grilled onion so not true Sin City Burger. It came with great recommendation from roommate regular. Really two type of onions probably pinch much with everything else going on in the burger. The burger itself was cooked too perfection (the smashburger style) nice moist and juicy on the inside. The bun itself was great! The haystack onions, bacon, fried egg, cheese, and sauce all perfect compliments. They cook their fried egg not so loose missing some of that egg yolk goodness makes fried egg on burger. Still overall solid burger one that would order again and again. The Smash fries had nice flavor with the garlic and rosemary oil. Everything is prepared too order so may take time but well worth the short wait knowing everything comes out HOT. 

There other things on the menu at Smashburger from chicken sandwiches too vegan options black bean burgers. If all else fails build your own burger too your taste. It  very reasonable price and filling. You order at the counter then find place sit and bring food out too you. The staff is really friendly and great service all around. Sure be back because few more burgers on menu want too try out. Still Bachi Burger one star over the top comes too gourmet burgers for my taste."}
{"text":"Go for the Western Burger awesome fried onion strips it's the best in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time here from Cali and I have to say that it is a damn fine burger! The shake is little frozen and the fries can use some work but the burger is par with in n out!"}
{"text":"We tried out Smashburger for the first time because we were looking for a hamburger that was relatively close. I've driven by this location at Stonecrest so many times in the past year, so I decided to give it a shot. Overall it is ok. I got the Carolina Chili Burger. While I'm happy to find a place that doesn't put mustard on it, overall it was just all right. The messy burger proved too much for the wire basket it's served in, so a lot got on the table. I don't remember exactly what my wife ordered - a baja spicy burger, or something like that. She had the same response. It was ok. The fries are of the shoestring variety, which is not my favorite. Unless you're a big eater, I recommend splitting the fries. I wouldn't have been able to finish a whole order alone, so splitting saved us some money. Again, Smashburger is pretty good. It's not going to blow you away, but it is quick and convenient. I would place it somewhere between a sit-down, order, and have a server bring you food type of restaurant and a fast food place - which I think is what it is aiming for (fast casual?). A good place if you want something relatively inexpensive and quick between shopping or just before a movie."}
{"text":"Smashburger never disappoints!  Great burgers, excellent fries and the milkshakes never fail to satisfy.

We've eaten here several times and have found the staff personable, the service prompt, and the location clean."}
{"text":"I love smash burger a big fan of their signature fries and black bean burger BUT not this location !!!  could not enjoy my meal when the restaurant was so dirty.  Dirt and grime every where tables, floors and walls, got a glimpse  of the kitchen as an employee walk out, yuck , i could not finish my meal. I actually felt like i needed a shower after leaving. The manager/owner needs to get to work and clean this place up.
 will not return...."}
{"text":"It's my first time eating here with my boyfriend. He got the classic smash and I created my own burger adding pickles, tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, smashsauce and fresh avocados. Perfect combination. We also shared some if the smash fries with are surprisingly amazing and light. Next time I'll get my own fries"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town. Very consistent and quality and staff has been friendly and courteous. The quality of the food is great and the choice is just right."}
{"text":"Okay, so let's be honest here; I've pretty much f*^ked my diet and thrown in the garbage..... then taken it out of garbage, shoved it down my throat then crapped it down the toilet.....okay scratch this introduction......start over...

On my occasional sojourn towards the Western hemisphere of Sin City, I have a list of places where I want to eat to review, but about the time I've reached the front doors of those yet-to-be-ventured dining establishments I scrap it, turn myself around and go to Smashburger- the best brick and mortar burger joint in town.

Now that consuming Burgers has virtually become a weekly event for me, I've decided to embrace my vices and dive in deep....real deep.  There and only there, will you find Smashburger; the mother load of decadence and flavor, your hands will smell of burger grease, onions and cheese for days.

Smashburger: Smash. Sizzle. Savor.  Catchy right?  Well, to be honest, they deliver a pretty amazing burger: the quality of meat is there (Angus Beef Meatball) which is smashed on the grill (giving it it's imperfect shape) sprinkled with heavenly Smash seasoning while on the grill which is then placed on top of a Butter Toasted Egg Bun.

I have only ordered one Burger here, the Sin City: The Smash Size (1/3 lbs.) + Fried Egg + Applewood Smoked Bacon + American Cheese + Grilled Onions + Haystack Onions + Smash Sauce on an Egg Bun.  And it will probably be the only Smashburger I will ever order, it is perfection! There's just an overload of flavors, the juiciest Burger that you will ever encounter; the rich Egg and Cheese proteins just coats your mouth like no other, the combo of Grilled and Haystack Fried Onions is a double punch of decadence - it's a flavor windfall with each bite.

As for Fries, I'm partial to Smash's Signature: Fries (well cooked) tossed with Rosemary + Olive Oil and Garlic.  I like the Italian twist that Smash offers, and since I can't find that anywhere in a fast food establishment, I get it every time. (they Sweet Potato Smash Fries are yummy too!)

By the time you're almost finished, you're hands and mouth are coated with a glorious glistening of rendered oil, and with an almost animal like post-mortem, you're overcome with a sense of calm satisfaction, like a pack of lions that have finished masticating a helpless (yet yummy) antelope. (calm down PETA- I'm too insignificant to be in the crosshairs of your bitter venom..)

Suffice it to say, Smashburger has the best burger in town and the reason why I go to the other side to get my fix?  Because if I start going the one closer to where I live, I would be there every day and be 400 lb. (worth every pound)

{"text":"took advantage of an online promo i saw to try a new hamburger they were offering called the sin city burger. i figured it was going to be one of those \"extreme\" food items that i'd regret getting because it'd be half a foot tall and impossible to eat without wearing it. but i signed on anyway because i had just been talking about the place with some friends who said they loved the place (i had never been). so after getting the confirmation of the promo invite, i brought along the same two friends to get some free grub with me. to say the employees were friendly would be a huge understatement. i don't know if they're always so attentive or if it was just because they knew that a promo was going on but they were on top of their game. and the food was great as well. the hamburger wasn't some huge, obnoxious pile of condiments, meat, and filler between two oversized bun halves but was a really well proportioned sandwich that wasn't a pain in the ass to eat. the smash fries were just kind of ok but the sweet potato fries were pretty awesome. i'll definitely be going back. well, anytime that i'm not worried about my caloric intake for the day that is."}

{"text":"I accidentally hit one star. I would never recommend this place ever! The prices are outrageous for the food they produce. The staff did not get any of our orders right. Worst burger place I've been to in a while! My family and I will stick with Freddy's!"}
{"text":"Finally went to try this place, since I had heard it was so good.  I thought it was okay.  I think In and Out and even Five Guys is better.  I got the smashfries, they were just kind of dry and plain.  I got the sin city burger, again just okay.  I like fried onion and egg in a burger, but it just wasn't as flavorful as other places.  Glad I got to finally try it, but probably won't be heading back."}
{"text":"Overall, great experience. Took my stepdad here for a late Father's Day lunch since neither of us have tried it before. Wasn't too busy when we came here. Was a couple people in line before us so it gave us time to check the menu. We ordered a Classic Smash Burger, BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger, and an order of Smash Fries. The downfall to this place is that you can't order a combo meal. Fries must be ordered on the side as well as a drink. Aside from that, menu looked great. Different kinds of burgers, along with an option to build your own burger. They have regular and big sized patties and an option for chicken instead of hamburger patties. Food arrived moments after we got our drinks and sat down. Burgers are really juicy and great taste. Definitely a burger I want to have again. Being from Southern California, I've had many different burgers and this is an awesome burger at a more than reasonable price."}
{"text":"Came here last night with friends. This review will be for their salad, since I didn't have their burger. My update will \"maybe\" be a burger..

Walking this in and seeing the menu it reminded me of a fatburger. the prices were just like fatburger and the upgrade and add ons were the same as well.

Kind of expensive considering other competitive place. A burger is 4.99, add fries its another 2 bucks and a drink is 1.79. 

I liked that they had sweet potato fries or regular strong fries. The hamburger options weren't too bad. They has pre made options. OR you could make your own with different sauces. I enjoyed they had about 6 or 7 different options. (i.e. ranch, buffalo sauce, blue cheese, or their secret sauce) They also have grilled chicken sandwiches or veggie burgers. They have different options for buns too. Cant forget they have chili cheese hot dogs too. yummm. 

They have fresh shakes that are made from hagn daez (idk how to spell it) like chocolate, root beer floats, etc. I would have loved to try one but i was watching my weight. NEXT TIME!

The salad were 4.99 and to add chicken it was an additional 2 bucks. They had four different options. The harvest, the cobb, the ceasar and a spinach one. The cobb looked best. It had bacon, egg, blue cheese, (i added crutons), chicken, ranch dressing and mixed greens. YUM! It was one of the best salads ive had in a while and it was huge. I took half of it home to my husband. 

Tasting the fries they were the norm (string ones) the sweet potato fries were good. 

My daughter got a hot dog and she really liked it except the seeded bun. Shes not used to that \"fancy-ness\" LOL.

The people inside weren't very friendly. The cashier acted very blonde and constantly had to look up things when we asked her questions about what were on the different combination burgers. I think they weren't very happy we came close to closing with 9 people. Eh."}
{"text":"Meh. Not great. I asked the fellow taking orders what he would recommend and he said \"I don't know I don't eat the food here.\" That should've been my first clue. I should've turned and walked out, but I didn't. I ordered the pub burger with no spicy mustard, and of course it came with spicy mustard. I got 10 minuscule tater tots. Everything was marginal and uninspired at best. I wasn't hungry when I left. That's about all the positive I can say. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I love the food here BUT the service was terrible today.  When my friend asked for a change to a wheat bun after the bill was rung up (no extra cost and not made up yet), the girl at the register said \"I have to walk over there and tell the kitchen\".  Very close btw.  The manager said in the kitchen \"you really want a wheat bun?\"  My friend said yes, please and of course when the burger came, it was white bread.  Horrible attitudes today.  Not usually that way.  A 4 because of the great food."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Over priced but still good. The customer service is horrible. Asking them any questions seem to annoy them. Usually most place if you call in your food you can skip the line and pay and collect your food. Not the case here. If you call in your food and wait the time for it to be ready your STILL have to wait in the 15+ min line to pay for your food. All this while your food is sitting there getting soggy and cold. Should maybe work on that part since they are flooded with a lot of people in the work force trying to get in and out first - hence calling in the order..."}
{"text":"The food is five-star but the service is one-star so that averages out to 3 stars! My food is great but i get this eerie feeling when I come in here because it's never busy and feels like it's going to go out of business and the weird manager is probably the reason. I'm sitting by myself and I just felt someone staring at me. And I look behind me and the manager, from across the dining room, is STARING at me. If you're managing a restaurant with no customers, then like go check your inventory, edit your schedule, balance the payroll, and check on your employees. Don't look at me. ¯\(°_°)/¯"}
{"text":"Smashburger?  More like...SALTburger.  Went here last night after hearing good things from friends and fellow yelpers....left disappointed with swollen tongues and greasy fingers. Between the two of us we ordered the BBQ Bacon burger(added the fried egg), Mushroom Swiss burger, regular fries and onion strings.  The burgers, while seemingly good at the initial few bites, soon covered our hands with grease and the fries/onion strings COATED in salt were nothing special. The flavor of the burgers was ruined because all we could taste was SALT!!!  For $25... we'll keep our money; and blood pressure at a normal level."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. The seating booths are really uncomfortable. The Rosemary fries were too oily."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here.

I love their smash fries.

I love their regular smash fries and sweet potato smash fries.

I love that I can get their burgers in a lettuce wrap. 

There's just something about their beef. It's really good. Some places, their burgers taste fake. Not here. 

I've been here several times and will continue to come."}
{"text":"This is more of a quick post than a full review as I only spent a few minutes in this place. I was next door at port of subs and decided to try the smashfries that I had heard so much about. As I walked in I was greeted by a friendly college age employee who was more than happy to answer any questions I had. I placed my order and sat back in one of their booths near the door and waited for my fries to be ready. 

This location is really small and can get crowed fast as they are super close to ASU. I gave this place three stars because the cook staff took a really long time to make my order, and the fries were kind of oily.
 While a little pricey I have decided to give them another shot as I hear they make a great burger. The next time I think I will try their location in Phoenix where hopefully it will not be as crowed."}
{"text":"Burgers were excellent!  I built a burger with lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, avocado, and cheddar cheese on a whole wheat bun.  After finishing our burgers and fries, we decided to go back for malted shakes, which were very tasty.  The only problem was the music - only short pieces of music played, sometimes only a few seconds, sometime longer, but not once did a song play through completely.  It was like being stuck in a car with someone changing the stations every thirty seconds - really annoying!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers...Really some of the best I have had. They smash them against the griddle so that the contact with the heat is maximized and you get the maximum Maillard crust.  
Great milkshakes too. 
Staff a bit aloof. 
I'm not crazy about the skinny little French fries because they get cold too fast."}
{"text":"I heard this place was awesome so we went - my whole family.  We get there and I am pleased with the base prices.  However I soon discovered that the more you add price skyrockets.  My husband and I order two salads, two plain cheeseburgers two shakes, a kids meal and two drinks... $50!!  Then they mess up the order and honestly the food was not that great.  Plenty of other burger joints in town I can feed my family on for a lot less money and way better quality.  Won't be going back...."}
{"text":"Its like - Hulk... Smash... on the burger.   Seriously - get the Sin City Burger... Its delicious... Sometimes the fries are a little greasy... but they are fries so I suppose that's to be expected.   They have an awesome soda pop selection on top of that...

Their menu is large, and in charge.  You can customize most things, including dadada - Gluten Free roll.  

Go Get it!"}
{"text":"Kinda like a Cane's but burgers instead of chicken. We stopped by right when they opened around 10:30a so it was nice and quiet and still clean. The cashier/server was nice and patient with us. Got the Sin City Burger with sweet potato fries and a bowl of chili. The burger was a bit messy, but they were nice enough to cut it for me and my bf to share. There's this flavor about the sweet potato fries that was awesome! Not the usual stuff, i dunno. But the chili was disappointing. Overall, though, good experience. I'd go back, but I gotta watch the waistline and I got too many places to explore."}
{"text":"More bells and whistles than Five Guys, better meat than In N Out, and more options than The Habit = I'm loving Smashburger! Tried it for the first time when I was killing time in the Tempe Marketplace before a flight. I was craving sweet potato fries per usual and discovered this place.

I ordered the Arizona Smash and sweet potato fries. I love that you can choose between the 1/3 or 1/2 pound patty, because sometimes you want to feel healthier than you are, you know? Anyways, the burger is dressed with habañero cheese, guacomole, spicy chipotle mayo, and jalapeno pepper slices. I'm becoming a little obsessed with spicy chipotle mayo lately, so I was glad to see it on the Arizona Smash. The spicy additions to this burger on their own have a little kick, but once they join forces, watch out! I was feeling the heat.

After a few trips to Smashburger, I've decided that sweet potato fries should always be prepared with rosemary and garlic because it's beyond fantastic."}
{"text":"Burgers are the new black I tell you. Notice these gourmet burger joints popping up all over the place? Well hopefully this one is here to stay as it is pure awesomeness! Not your ordinary burger, the Sin City smashburger is dressed with their smash sauce, a fried egg , bacon, grilled onions, cheese, and onion straws piled on a warm toasted egg bun. The meat was piping hot, tender and falls apart when you bite into it, creating a mess on your plate (at least it doesn't get all over your face...) 
Good burgers, good fries and onion straws, good shakes, and guess what else? This place serves beer and wine!!! What more do you need?!"}
{"text":"Short: Get the Mushroom Burger

Longer: Man, that mushroom burger is so damn good. Been there 3 times now and haven't been able to try anything else because I keep craving that burger. I'm also a sucker for truffle and it's got some truffle oil in there. It's an overall juicy burger too. Definitely a fan of this place. Service is what you would expect at a fast food restaurant. I guess this might be borderline fast casual though since they bring you your burger.

I'm a big garlic fan, but don't like rosemary at all so keep that in mind if you're like me and consider skipping their specialty smash fries. The regular ones are good and crisp."}
{"text":"Burgers were good, not great, and staff was rushed which caused them to be rude. I liked the upbeat and young environment and do plan on going back. Those fries were out of this world."}
{"text":"Sometimes I want a burger but just can't handle anything too heavy at night. So I really love the smashed chicken options at Smashburger especially with the gluten free bun. The rosemary garlic fries are also just right. Sometimes garlic fries sound good at the time but you end up regretting it the next day. Not here. Just the right amount of flavor.

During our visit we did have a few issues with our order. I realize that we all are prone to making making mistakes sometimes but it is how you respond that brings out your true character. In this case our server apologized and the manager went out of his way to make things right. We were really impressed with their professionalism and, despite the mixups, will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Eh... It was ok. I had heard that it was better than In and Out so I had to try and I was not impressed at all with it. Big burgers, light flavor."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm still tasting this burger and although I was severely drunk by the time I got to the meal every bite was sooooo good!

I got the Sin City burger which had onion strings, cheese, fried egg, and a 1/2 lb patty..Need I say more? I was surprised to know this combo didn't make the burger salty overall and I can't say enough about the beef..It was just melt in your mouth juicy and the seasoning of the meat was just representin' for the 702..(Yes cool or not I just said that)..Haha

You also have to try the smash frys as well..I believe there was rosemary, olive oil, and garlic..Now that partnered with a crotch moistening burger was a happy ending for anyone's taste buds!"}
{"text":"2 stars since the staff were very attentive and friendly. No stars lost for customer servive reasons. 

The food however is incredibly greasy, I've been here twice and thought it was just a one time thing that I had a massive headache after eating here..but two times. You can see the grease left on the tray after eating. I get it's fast food but probably the saltiest and greasiest burger I have ever had. 

Fries are good at least. Love the flavours they use for it"}
{"text":"We went in there before a movie the other day and got a couple cheeseburgers and split an order of fries.  Of course, I had a groupon.  The girl at the front desk was ok, restaurant was a little messy, but they were pretty busy, so I let that go.  The cheeseburgers were divine.  Just greasy enough to be juicy but not gross.  French fries were ok, nothing special, but not horrible either.  And it's right outside one of my favorite movie theatres, so that was definitely a bonus.   Cheeseburgers though were definitely a step above the average run of the mill one.  I just started a diet so no more cheeseburgers for me...I'll miss you, Smashburger (sob...)"}
{"text":"Always great burgers and service! Check in or download the Smashburger app for free stuff!

Arizona burger with jalapeños is a must!"}
{"text":"Sign up for their emails because you get great deals. Ex, B1G1F or free shakes with a purchase,

The food alone speaks for itself.. like the sun city burger. Delicious! Fried egg, bacon, grilled onion and onion stacks on a good sized beef patty. Love it!

What lacks here is customer service. The night crew talks too much with one another. Too many people for a night crew. Five to six people. I used to be the manager for fatburger and we only needed three. But anyway, I tried calling for 30 mins at work to place my order and they kept hanging up on me. When I went I person to order they said it was because an old lady kept prank calling an order in every 15 to 20 mins. I had a large order and asked them to repeat it to me before I left. When I got home my order was wrong. All my salad dressings were missing, my side order of haystack onions weren't in the bag. Maybe if they stopped socializing, they'd had gotten my order correct. Just a theory, 

But can't say no to the food, so I will be back"}
{"text":"It was okay...my burger was hella dry and I even ordered extra cheese...the girl at the counter though was very kind"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this is better than Five Guys but the Arizona Burger is delicious and we love the sweet potato fries.  Service is very quick and friendly, good central location for Northwest Phoenix (Norterra) area.  We've been half a dozen times and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a very few times I want something and a place actually delivers. That's right I wanted a big juicy sloppy burger. Ask and I received; I ordered the Big Carolina Chili Burger w/ Smash Fries. The food was good and the smash fries were extra excellent with nice flavor. Nice modern feel and very clean although it was pretty empty on a Monday at 5pm. I could imagine what it is like on the weekend with the movie theater practically next door. My only complaint was the annoyance of a nasty fly roaming about annoying my family and I. It would also be good to put some combos up on the menu rather then ordering a burger and fries separate and a bigger kids menu would be appreciated."}
{"text":"Opened my order to see the biggest mess ever.
Rude cook, packed food Togo even though we asked for having it there. Ranch was overfilled so exploded when they threw a lid on it. 
Not only that but we ordered a large buffalo fry and we received a regular size fry and a regular size buffalo fry.

Seriously people... Pull it together
Can't imagine we will be back ANY time soon."}
{"text":"Omg this place is to die for. When I need a burger fix this is where I go. The food is always fresh. I can't wait to get the new fries."}
{"text":"Placed my order a  Arizona burger and smash fries, order arrived and the fries were plain French fries I mentioned the mix up to the server and he took them back and returned with what looked like fresh smash fries only for us to realize they were luke  warm super greasy smash fries. Totally disappointed will not return"}
{"text":"Was extremely disappointed with my visit today,  usually the food is awesome not so much today, the smash fries were swimming in grease and my Arizona burger bun tasted like it was day old. I can say after today I'm not a smash fan anymore !"}
{"text":"Horrible service with rude employees who do not care about their job. Time and time again they never fail to fuck up a simple order for two people. 

The quality of food and atmosphere have been a lot better in the past years when the staff actually did their jobs correctly. Not planning on going back to any locations (this experience has been the same at lake mead and buffalo location). 
I would highly recommend saving your money and going elsewhere. Unless of course you love waiting forever to receive an incorrect order accompanied by various inconsiderate employees.
 
All in all, it is really frustrating dealing with incompetent individuals who do not care enough to give any sort of effort in their job."}
{"text":"Very good better than five guys burgers. More stuff to.   Must nead this in Tucson. My must go."}
{"text":"My friends are always eating here so I had a friend in town and we couldn't decide what to eat. I then suggested Smashburger. We were both skeptical because we frequent a fancy burger bar in LA that is out of this world. So we decided to give it a taste. We were pleasantly surprised ! The burgers were inexpensive and the staff was friendly! I loved all the choices and that you can choose beef or chicken (grilled or fried) for every burger. I have now gone back there 2 times since. I do think they should offer a turkey and veggie burger."}
{"text":"My my how things have changed in 2 years. This Smashburger location went from one of our favourite places to dine-out to being a bit of a disaster.
The issues are twofold:
First - seems like the company as a whole is undergoing changes, for the worst. It's like they are cutting corners to save money. This was very apparent when we got our chicken sandwiches and they were like half the size of what we normally get. I swear it was the same bun as a kid's size burger!  And it wasn't the price that was reduced, just the size of the entree itself. Well that makes me never want to go back to Smashburger again! We LOVED their chicken sandwiches, and now at almost $8 for a couple bites... no thank you. That's just bad for business. 
Second - maybe it's a new manager, I don't know, but this location always used to be really on point. The staff was fantastic. Our last visit was as if a hurricane blew through there.... I waited over 20 mins for my simple order, watched as customers were turned away or walked out (after being told there was a 40 min wait for a burger), watched as the manager stomped around and declared she was \"done with this\", watched as people brought their food back because there was something wrong with the order, the place was a mess, etc etc etc...
All I got was a half-hearted \"sorry for the wait\".... it might as well have been \"don't come back\".

This may sound corny, but we used to feel like \"valued guests\" at this Smashburger - I would always do the survey and give them the highest marks. Last night we felt like were the last customers of a business about to close their doors. What a terrible experience."}
{"text":"I typically don't eat hamburgers when I go out to eat. I can make burgers at home, after all. And I make a pretty mean burger mind you. I like to just throw on whatever I am in the mood for at home. Avacado, spinach, egg roll, sesame roll, hot mustard, and don't get me started on all of the wonderful cheeses! Sorry, I got excited there for a moment. 

Let me get back to Smashburger. I bring up the customization because I can do that at Smashburger. It is nice to look up and just mix and match beyond mustard and ketchup. I have mixed and matched with everything. I have even tried Frank's Red Hot  with goat cheese. Let's just say some things are better than others but at least I have the choice. But if you get just a plain All American burger, then you are still in for a treat. Juicy, hot, and just overall sumptuous. It sounds redundant to say this, but this is a great place to get a burger.

Beyond the good burgers they make a pretty good hot dog. My daughter eats them when we go there about half of the time. I am glad that she can't finish them most of t he time because Daddy doesn't believe in wasting food if you know what I mean. Make sure you grab a basket of fries as well, they are pretty darn good as well. I personally like to throw on some chili and cheese. If you are going to eat out you might as well go all the way! I haven't had a chicken sandwich here yet but my wife has eaten the black bean burger several times and likes it with some Smash Sauce. She throws on some odd sides but when you aren't eating meat, you have to get creative.

I always like to put in something about the establishment and its staff. They are pretty  good to go. They can't help the fact that the line is out the door most days but they do a really good job of keeping the speed up so that the line is moving well. The facilities have been very clean each visit and I can only imagine that isn't an easy feat considering the traffic that must go through there each day. Everybody I have interacted with is very nice. They move quickly so you really can't get a word in to often. Understandable. My biggest gripe has nothing to do with the local staff and that is price. It isn't cheap but I guess it is a somewhat higher level burger joint. I could go to the McDonald's across the street if I wanted lower prices. I could also eat asphalt on a bun. I wouldn't do either.

My wife just reminded me to mention the fried pickles. Yeah, she eats the weird stuff."}
{"text":"I like smashburger, but didn't enjoy this location. We were the only people there on a Friday night. The surrounding businesses were poppin with patrons. My milkshake was so gross I didn't drink it (and I love milkshakes). My burger was good, but the fountain drinks werent bearable. I avoid soda, so the options were tea, water and vitamin water. The vitamin water was too sweet, the tea tasted like ...let's try another drink, and the water tasted like tap water, and not in a good way. They messed up one order so we had to wait for the sandwich to be remade. They also forgot the bacon. I did enjoy the burger, but the overall experience wasn't good."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD!!! but the customer is what will bring me back! came into this smash location close to closing time and all the employees at the front made us feel so welcome! Zae took our order and helped us so much throughout the ordering process!! the other employee named Sam was very attentive & came around plenty of times to make sure everything was looking good!"}
{"text":"Burger was decent, sweet potato fries good, but kids who seem to run the place were non responsive and busy chatting with each other. Tables were dirty. Too many other choices to return"}
{"text":"Holy smokes this burger was good,  Brought to our table so hot you could hardly eat it.  Got our fry order wrong,  did not think I would like the rosemary/olive oil fries,  but got them by mistake tried them an loved them.  If you like your burger hot with all the trimmings you will love this.  1/3 lb. or 1/2 lb. size meat and both are generous.  Tried it for the first time Friday and we will be back,  they are building more so looking for one a little closer eventually in the meantime I will travel. Not a huge eating area but it was constantly busy, some tables outside or takeout of course.  The people were friendly and very helpful stopped by table to see if we were satisfied and when we asked questions about other locations he was happy to advise. Oh did I tell you they were juicy, they were, and very tasty."}
{"text":"Like this place better than Five Guys! Very comfy seating arrangements. Nice service. Salads were lacking for non-meat eaters, sadly."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today...we have driven by it plenty and always wander into Chipotle instead.  

I ordered the BBQ, Bacon, and Cheese burger.  It was delicious.  Great flavor, but it was lukewarm at best.  My sweet potato fries were the same way, well-flavored but almost cold.

My husband ordered the Arizona burger and said it wasn't spicy at all...his fries were also COLD.

The restaurant itself was kind of a train wreck.  I know it's supposed to be trendy, but Ke$ha at full blast doesn't help an already mediocre experience.  The ice maching was out of ice and there was no silverware. It cost 25 bucks for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 2 drinks...not EXPENSIVE, but it just didn't feel like we got what we paid for.

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"In my opinion, there's nothing above average about these thin, over-salted burger patties. 

Smashburger gets one star for a nice and clean restaurant, and two stars for the smashfries (rosemary, garlic, olive oil - delicious). 

I ordered the Spicy Baja burger. It comes with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato, and spicy chipotle mayo on a chipotle bun. When I placed my order, I asked for avocado instead of guacamole. It wasn't until I sat down that I realized they charged me $2 extra for that substitution. Usually, I wouldn't mind, and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't guacamole made by mashing up avocado? And the piece of avocado that came on top of my burger was the size of two fingers and all I could do was roll my eyes. 

Overall, the burger was nothing special. The patty was salty and a little dry and did not have much flavor. The burger was not juicy, it was greasy. There is a difference. Why eat here when you can walk 50 feet north and have In N Out?

My friend ordered the Sin City Burger and when he was about half way through his burger, he looked at me and said, \"this just might be the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth.\" O_o

Perhaps I did not order the right burger, or perhaps I'm just a little picky when it comes to burgers... but I am not a fan."}
{"text":"Came back to Cesar's to find that they have a new food court right when you exit the parking structure. From the looks of it, there was a lot of good restaurants so I wanted too give SmashBurger a try. Looking at all the yelp reviews prior left me somewhat uncertain if I should give it a try.

The line was first ridiculously long. There was about only 8 or so people in front of me but the wait just to order took 20 minutes. I had ordered the smash fries and truffled Swiss burger. For a burger and fries alone, I was shocked to find out it came to a whopping $13.00. Being my time first to SmashBurger, I was expecting a big ass double patty burger and large fries but after mother 15 minutes wait, I came to find the burger patty to be wee tiny, no more than a dinky cheese burger at McDonald's. The fries itself was great, slightly oily but it was flavored with olive oil but still rather very small. 

Everything was I finished everything in 8 minutes.  Not much of a burger. Either they add more portion for the price your paying or lower the price."}
{"text":"I have not gone back yet but I will say that I was given some Smashbucks by management to give it another try. I am impressed by their follow-up and eager attitude with customers experience.  So....I will go give it a try soon."}
{"text":"Like the other post suggests, the staff were a little rude and seemed very uninterested. The burger and fries are good though, filling and tasty. I really enjoyed my Oreo shake."}
{"text":"This place is a great burger joint. The fries are really good as well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a second try because I was across the street grocery shopping. Well they are two for two. Our order the first time was disgusting and the second time we tried it today the order was incorrect. The employee who was packing up the orders gave me my food and I checked it and said to him \"the sauces are missing\" he then went back to look at the screen to review my order and starts preparing my sauces. I said thank you and left. When I got home I unpacked the food and noticed that he only got one of the sauces right. We order the Buffalo sandwich with the sauce on the side and he gave me NO buffalo but gave me two BBQ. So now I have this plain sandwich with no sauce. I ordered the ranch on the side for the California club and I had to ask for that sauce too. Also none of the smash sauce either. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO SOMEPLACE ELSE. It's frustrating that these people cannot get the freaking order right. COME ON NOW!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good burger,however the place was a pig pen. Food on floor,food on tables,tables needed to be wiped down. Shame,good burger,but for the money,we can go anywhere. Sorry to say,our last time,no excuses for messy,dirty,restaurant"}
{"text":"First went to Smashburger in the Centennial Hills plaza at Ann Rd & 95, but took my bf here for the first time recently.  He ordered the Bacon Double cheeseburger, and I ordered the SmashChicken with avocado, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. Both came out in a hurry, we split onion straws and their signature smash fries in the rosemary and olive oil. Yum!  I actually prefer the deep fried pickles, but he hates pickles so for the first time visit, I was nice and let him try the fries. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome burger.  I had one in Ohio about two years ago and loved it.  For only being open two days, this place was humming and the staff had their business down.  My order came out perfect and quick.  The AZ burger was awesome.  Not too spicy, but very good balanced flavor with each bite.  The smash sweet potato fries were just delicious.  Tossed in salt, olive oil and rosemary, still crunchy, and nice and sweet.  I'm glad we have one close to work now!"}
{"text":"I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever. 

Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars? 

Ugh."}
{"text":"Long as Russell is here you have nothing to worry about, when he leaves then there will be a problem. His spirit can't help but to make your food taste great, his personality feels the whole atmosphere. 

If you want a good time and great food, I recommend this Smash Burger out of every single one in Vegas. 

PS: You will know who he is when you walk in the place lol."}
{"text":"Hello Yelpers I'd like to introduce the best burger for the money I've ever have.  The Sin City Smash burger w/ spicy chipotle mayo and jalapenos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smashburger-las-vegas-4?select=7gPzfADwbIT6xb3utlcKcw#tEvMVRY-uTBvyT29kvln5A whoa!!! Whoa!! Hands off!!! 

I've always been hesitant to going to Smash Burger cause I always heard \"Oh expensive\" haha what!? Not even expensive.  Dumb non-yelpers haha jk.  I could have been eating smash burger for the 100th time not just 2nd. Oops I just saw a few yelpers say it's expensive, they're cool.  I think they're still kind of cheap for a good burger but yes a little expensive for a chain burger place especially if you throw in the add ons that aren't free.  When you go to Smash Burger do yourself a favor and just get the Sin City Smash Burger which already has a fried egg, bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onion and the smash sauce and play around with the free add ons.  I liked mine with the spicy mayo and jalapenos.  You don't always have to build your own burger that's when it gets pricey.  The fries are real good too. In and Out is good but I like Smash Burger (burgers and fries) more. 

I heard they use to offer those punch cards for frequently eating there but nope not anymore but they do serve cheap beer. I'm not a fan of the service and that they don't have a drive thru."}
{"text":"I have been to smash burger a couple of times.  Each time I have gone I have gotten the Buffalo grilled chicken sandwich and smash fries.  The sandwich comes with Frank's RedHot Buffalo sauce, crumbled blue cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo on an egg bun.  Frank's red hot adds that extra kick of flavor which made the sandwich more enjoyable.  The blue cheese is a good balance to the spiciness of the hot sauce.  I enjoyed the sandwich a lot.  The smashfries are always good because it's a twist on normal fries.  Smash fries are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  Overall the service is ok but the food is good.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"Grappled with the numbers of stars here.  3 means A-OK...well the food was but if I could rate the service separately it would barely get one.  Dirty tables, messed up orders, inattentive staff.  And this time, there were only five of us.  On the plus side, my black burger tasted great...once I got eat it.  They messed up on the bun and by the time they brought me the correct bun (no sauce) my friends were almost done eating.  The lady behind us had undercooked chicken.  Come on!  Bring back Chris, the awesome manager.  They were even out of my favorite beer:("}
{"text":"Rated three stars compared to four for competitor In-n-O and five for gourmet burgers. 

A better rating than three stars is precluded because burger bun was cold to the touch and fries were very salty. 

Oreo milkshake and customer service were excellent!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today for the first time.  I was impressed with the burger.  I ordered a Mushroom Swiss burger.  The mushroom has a good sauteed and the burger was very juicy and tasty.  You can tell they really marinated the beef well.  It reminds me of Zin Burger in a way that the beefs are tender and juices splash out as you bite into it.  I don't really care for the fries that much.  It was little greasy and salty. The price is reasonable. Also, definitely need to wash your hands after eating the big juicy burger.  =)"}
{"text":"Always super nice, especially the staff. They always seem to go above and beyond what is asked of them. Also, the truffle mushroom swiss chicken sandwich off the hook!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok tonight but this place is horribly mis managed.  Get ready to wait for your food and witness stupidity at its finest.  Pretty inconsistent burgers too."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE, THEY DON'T SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY
Smashburger is one of those places that seems great when you see the setup and the way they do things and the overall aesthetic.  When it's all said and done its just an average burger and fries at an above average price.  South Street, Fat Burger and five guys all have burgers that taste easily as good and are cheaper.  
            *takes too long
            *won't let you call in an order
            *TOO EXPENSIVE
            
AND!!!  This morning was the McKenzie Towne Stampede Breakfast, Smashburger has got their Logo on the advertising.  They are open for business, but come on, most people are there for the free pancakes.  So when it starts to rain, does the balding, slightly heavyset manager see the opportunity to meet and greet and make some people happy with great marketing....
NO HE DOES NOT!!
BOO BOO BOO Smashburger, I'm sure your outside food and drink policy can be flexible on at a special event.  And don't even try to tell anyone that it is for health code reasons because that is a lie."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe this place has such a low rating.  Maybe some problems after they first opened?  I dunno..  I love this place.  We have them in St Louis, so when I was home for Christmas I stopped by for dinner.  I love the smashburger.. hot and juicy!  I built my own with guacamole and bacon - deeelicious.  I'm not a fan of the smashburger fries, so I went with sweet potato fries and fried pickles (I couldn't choose!)  

Staff was friendly and helpful, offering refills and clearing plates immediately.  I'd definitely go back!

My only complaint is that they don't have unsweetened tea."}
{"text":"What has happened to this location?! Awkward  feeling while eating. The manager or assistant manager shouting across the restaurant to the young cashier to clean up the bathroom and not the dishes or the dining room. I stared at her and she seemed to whisper instead. Friday night and the dining room was a mess. Dirty floors and dirty tables, had to ask to get one cleaned. They forgot a topping and was half wash done with my burger before they brought it out with no customers in line. With many other locations, I will probably skip this one."}
{"text":"Had the Spinach,  Cucumber,  and Goat Cheese burger and Sweet Potato Fries and ... wow! One of the best burgers I've had had in a long time. Food was hot and toppings were fresh and crisp.
Topped off with a great strawberry shake - they even left the mixing cup for what didn't fit in the glass. Nice touch.

Comatose now but definitely worth it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A lot of people have been talking about this place, and when I saw the Groupon it was my key to try it.

I ordered smash fries, 1/3 Sin City burger and a root beer float to go. While I was driving in my car, I was munching on the smash fries. Too much rosemary, not enough salt. Just not good flavor, which left me thinking the burger would be mediocre as well.

When I got to my destination, I unwrapped the burger. It looked super greasy and unappealing, but whoa! Seriously the best burger that I have ever had! It melted in my mouth, which almost seems impossible for a burger, but it did. The bun is soft and fresh. The meat is juicy and full of flavor. Altogether, amazing! 

Someone said it's not as good as Five Guys - Wrong! The actual burger is better than In-N-Out (had it for lunch the same day, so it was fresh in my memory), Shack Shake in New York, Five Guys, Grind Burger, Burger Bar, etc.

Pass on the fries. They need to work of those! The root beer float you can make on your own. 

Yes it is pricey, but it's gourmet. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"I like Smashburger burgers. They use good meat and ingredients - not at all like the typical fast food. They can get soggy pretty quick - which isn't necessarily a bad thing. They are on the pricey side. The burgers justify it. It's the sides that are overpriced. I attached a photo of my milkshake to go. It out barely filled half the cup. And it wasn't a large cup. Just count on lunch being $10-15."}
{"text":"Many-year Smash veteran but first time at this one. I know Friday lunch crowds can be big, so I ordered ahead online. 

The online process was efficient, easy and fast. I was offered a time slot 15 mins ahead. I arrived on schedule and there were 18 5th graders in line. So glad I ordered ahead cuz I just stepped up to the quick counter and was gone in 4 mins. 

I created my own burger, adding cheese, bacon and a side of buffalo fries for less than $9.50. 

Burger was done right and they had tossed in a couple packs of ketchup plus a small tub of ranch. I don't like either but it was still a nice touch. 

This Smash has got it together. Go but if you don't mind eating at your desk at work or dining table at home, order ahead. You could always unwrap it and eat it there!"}
{"text":"I just finished a classic burger with the veggie frites and couldn't be happier!!! So delish! A very clean and friendly atmosphere, we will be back."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. It took about twenty minutes to be served at noon on a Thursday. Food was good, but not worth the wait/price."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars because of the General Manager. I did the \"craft your own burger\" I asked for multi grain bread she then asked a beef patty? I said no and no to black bean patty and I continued on that I just wanted vegetables and a fried egg. I don't think this woman has ever heard of a veggie burger or something because the look on her face. She then said so you just want a bunch of veggies piled up? I said yes. When they brought my \"burger\" she had told the chefs in the back to just put it on a plate for me. Everything I ordered was literally in a pile on a plate. I returned it and stated that I had asked for multi grain bread. She needs to learn new people skills because her attitude is disgusting."}
{"text":"1st time eating there.. And found out they sell BEER! ya I was a little excited but burger was good cooked2order ... Going back soon!"}
{"text":"The best burgers and sweet potato fries around, but they consistently UNDERSERVE and do not give you a full portion of fries.  My \"extra large\" was not even 3/4 full.  People, when you have such a great product, why on earth would you \"cheap out\" and not serve your repeat customers.  Five Guys gives you tons of fries, but they're soggy and undercooked.

Maybe you'll get the message, but I guess we have to double order until they change their policies.  Please start giving us more of your delicious SPF and I'll be happy to give you a well deserved five star rating!"}
{"text":"Smash Burgerrrrrr what has happened my friend? Oh, I know? Shake Shack...that's what happened! 

Hmm...I'm going to say it's the location and not the burger?!@&$ I ordered the Classic Smash (schmall)and the honey got a double, triple something along the lines of that, plain Jane with cheese. Along with some Smash fries which is tossed in rosemary, garlic and olive oil. YUMMM!

The burgers were okay this time around. One of the things I LOVED about smash burger is their \"Smashed Burgers\" The edges weren't as crisp as I remembered b/c it was one of my favorite things about their burger and seemed much smaller in size. The fries were so good! I wanted more of that if anything.

I'm probably going to go back to the other location on Las Vegas Blvd and see if that one is still up to par."}
{"text":"Someone needs to tell the manager that 2 employees at a time IS NOT ENOUGH. I shouldn't be calling an order in 20 minutes in advance and waiting another 20 minutes when I arrive. Delicious food, slow workers and clearly cheap/incompetent management"}
{"text":"Well, to start off... This place is a RIP off! Smashburger used to be good. I order 2 burgers and sides for my mother and myself and the portion size is small and dried out. Overcooked! The vanilla malt had to be remade 3 times because the malt was bulky in the shake and super thick and not creamy. The understanding is this company is cutting corners to save a buck."}
{"text":"I had the regular smash burger with sweet potato fries, and it was DELICIOUS! I've been craving a burger and this hit the spot. Bathroom could use some tending, good A+!"}
{"text":"Make sure your napkin holder is full and to have shameful, delicious stink of burger on your hands for hours. Order at the register. They give you a number. Find your own spot.

Whoa! These guys serve cheap beer. Sure it's just Hamms or PBR, but it's only a couple bucks. Downside is that you either have to keep going up for beers- tons of separate transactions, or you have to order more than one for yourself- it gets warm.

I still like In N Out more. However these guys have good fries, sweet potato and regular, that drip delicious grease. The burgers are messy too, making dignified consumption difficult. What the hey, I'm already downing a Hamms, dignity long gone. The only thing I wished for was aioli to dip the fries in.

Spicy Baja: It's not end-of-world spicy. The \"smash\" size is more than enough. Retrospectively, In N Out patties have better flavor, but I did not even notice plowing through that monster.

I'd eat other burgers, but I'll have to sneak in furikake. I guess that's kind of why I only give 3 stars. Though it's the fatty burger experience I enjoy, it leaves me wanting just a little bit more."}
{"text":"Got the classic burger and oreo shake combo.  The oreo shake was delicious but I didn't feel the burger was anything special.  I'll probably give it another chance, at a non-airport location and see how it goes.  The egg bun is neat."}
{"text":"I thought the food could have been hotter, and disappointed that the gift card reader was not working"}
{"text":"I recently went back to Smashburger and tried their Smash Classic, a chocolate shake, and Smashfries. The burger and shake were fantastic, but the Smashfries were the greasiest thing I might have ever eaten. I asked the guy behind the counter if the fries were normally this oily? He said they normally are \"pretty greasy.\" I go to Samshburger, but I never intend to order their Smashfries."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite burger place in town. So fresh, such a great selection of toppings and sides like garlic fries. Oh, and beer. Nice employees, Brandon was friendly and helpful. Good location, clean, comfortable. I got the bacon chee with onion straws and an Angry Orchard, 12 bucks. Yum."}
{"text":"Burger was mediocre for kind of expensive, and toppings were soggy making it even less appealing.  Tots were extra crispy which is just the way I like them, but I forgot to ask for ketchup so they didn't give me any.  Therefore the tots were a bit bland. They also didn't give me any napkins without asking.  Customer service was slow and not the best and since the food wasn't my favorite I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"No idea why this place is getting such horrible reviews. The food was great- it's fast food, but great quality. The customer service was perfectly fine, and all staff held a smile despite several obviously drunk customers."}
{"text":"I frequent this Smashburger location several times a month.  My favorite is the BBQ Bacon Burger with Smashfries.  Khalilah has taken my order several times when I visit and she has always been sweet and even when it gets busy she is still polite. I noticed that whether it's straightening the chairs or cleaning the tables, she always seems productive.  She is an asset to your establishment.  I would also like to add that my burger is always delicious! Just a tip for future customers...do the survey on the your receipt and you can get a free side with your purchase of an entrée! Thank you Khalilah for a job well done!!"}
{"text":"Smashburger - what's the fascination with abusing the patty on the grill so the burger falls apart in your hand?  (Five Guys does it too...)

Not my thing.

It's a tasty burger - nice place - friendly servers - nothing wrong with it.

I just don't like having my burger disintegrate while I'm trying to eat it."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer since the day Smash opened this location! GREAT customer service, they no me by name and my order. The food is always exactly how I ordered it, never disappointed. I am there at least twice a week... Although I have my favorite meal, I have tried others and everything is just as good- The VERY BEST shakes! Love that you can sit down or take out with prompt service for both, but if you dine in you can have a beer with your meal. Ohhh don't tell them I told you but you can actually get your burgers 5x well done for those of your that want toooo pink! I am known for this request."}
{"text":"Terribly managed location. Super busy and they always have just the one register open. Tables are never cleared, mediocre customer service. Good food but leaves a sour taste in your mouth because of everything else."}
{"text":"Don't go in this location they have the worst service ever. Our server Jennifer is so rude and unprofessional. Want my milkshake in a classic metal cup and she brought it in a paper cup and when I asked her why is that so and she answered \" we don't have a clean one right now\" and walk away. WOW what a service. The location lake mead and buffalo."}
{"text":"This is the filthiest establishment I've ever been to. Soda fountain and surrounding area had spilled dried sticky soda all over the place. Tables were dirty with previous patrons' old plates and drinks. Entire place had a foul odor. The floors looked like they haven't been swept or mopped in over a week. If u swabbed this place with a sterile Q tip and pitri dish, i'd be very scared to see what would grow. The manager is slacking hard at this joint."}
{"text":"Seriously SmashBurger. $9 for a burger, $4 for fries, and $4.50 for a Pepsi. Talk about raping customers.  I'm done. No excuse for this pricing. $19 for what should be a burger combo (if you had one)."}
{"text":"I had to update this location as it has now created my new fave burger! It entails a multigrain bun and the toppings consist of the new spinach, cucumber and goat cheese! Light and almost guilt free! Also on the burg comes onion (red) and light balsamic. Delicious! Crunchy from the cukes and onces that goat cheese melts onto the perfectly cooked patty you will sing it's praises! I added hot sauce for the perfect amount of heat. There was so much spinach on it, I feel like popeye-ette!
4 stars on this date as the place was not as clean as normal (chairs, tables, floors) and there was a newer manager working this date that I did not recognize. I think he hates his life today... but it is Apr 18 and it is snowing a blizzard out there so I cannot blame him too much!
Get here and try this new burger!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a smash burger, smash fries and a chocolate shake. It's a premium burger joint with great quality ingredients without all the hustle of the overpriced joints. Best burger I've had, been coming here since they opened this location.   If you are looking for a beef alternative they have a black been patty I tried a taste of recently that was pretty phenomenal."}
{"text":"I was expected the typical In n Out, Five Guys, etc...but was not...Ordered create your own 1/3lb(lettuce, onion, cheddar, mustard, and FRESH jalapenos), smash fries and a coke. Very juicy flavorful and just Good! I found my new burger joint! It's not the best I've had but it is good enough to have me going back for more. Smash fries have rosemary and garlic and quite frankly you must like rosemary to like the fries. I like rosemary! Coke products is always a plus for me. They also offer rootbeer in a bottle and shakes. If you're looking for a good juicy burger this is the place...

Note: I went to the Tempe location for a burger to go...HOCKEY PUCK! Advised the manager and he comped my next meal which was good..."}
{"text":"I ordered the Classic Big Smash Burger with a regular Coke, no sides, to go at $9.40.   The burger was excellent and I especially liked the potato-based bun, which is the way Mom served burgers when we went picnicking.  Good memories.

Overall, a positive experience even though they're still amping up their service level as a new location.  Will this become my gotta-go-to burger haunt?  They'll have to get in line behind Brook's Sandwich Shop, Pinky's Westside Grill, and Bad Daddy's on West Blvd.  

If you're in the neighborhood and suddenly get a hankerin' for seared beef, I say \"Give 'em a whirl!\""}
{"text":"First time at this Smash. It was clean, cool and moderate music playing. Good start. 

I arrived at 6:45 on a Friday evening. There were 10 in line but they had good efficiency and I was thru in about five mins. 

I ordered two burgers, two fries and donated a buck to their current promo for cancer research. It came to $13.46 cuz I had a bogo coupon. It wouldn't print  at home but they honored it anyway. I had also ordered cheese on both and bacon on one, a total of $2.70 extra. 

My meal, to go, was ready in seven mins. Everything was hot when I got home. I was missing one order of fries though. I checked the receipt and he did charge, but failed to add it to the bag. I'm not sure I can recommend this Smash for good food and good service, due to the missing fries."}
{"text":"My first time visiting a smash burger and it was very good. We ordered and received 10% off with yelp check in. I had the avocado bacon burger. Delicious. Good flavor, perfectly cooked burger on a soft bun. I was impressed. My boyfriend had the sin city burger and he liked it his only complaint was it was a little on the greasy side. The fries were cooked perfectly and salted nicely. The service was good and our food was delivered to our table in about 7 minutes. They cook to order. It was on the pricey side $16 for two burgers one order of fries and one drink. But I will be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my two pre-teen daughters (so keep in mind the horrors of an ordering process). They were absolutely wonderful. The manager Bryan took care of us, and was very patient with me and the process. Very nice and attentive to what we needed. He was there training some people for the new location in Laughlin, I guess, and they were equally as amazing. The girls even at the end said, \"he definitely deserves a tip\". I agreed!"}
{"text":"Black bean burger and Arizona burger are to die for!! They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Admittedly good burgers.  They are on the small side and pretty expensive.  Expect to spend at least ten dollars on a basic no frills meal.  I ordered a regular burger and fries with a drink.  I also ordered a kids burger and a drink for my daughter (kids meal comes with fries or applesauce). She's not a big eater but it wasn't enough food for her,  I shared my fries and took her for ice cream after"}
{"text":"The service here is great with really outgoing employees. A burger place where they check back with you to see if you like your meal impresses me.  The hamburger had some interesting toppings including goat cheese which I liked and seemed fresh.  The potato fries were ok.  Problem is nothing was really out of the ordinary for me.  I can't say don't try Smashburger, you may really like it.  It's kind of like In or Out which people rave about.  It didn't do much for me.  I would go back to Smashburger before I'd go back to In or Out."}
{"text":"Bleh. 

I've tried this place twice now, once for a burger and once for the chicken. I'm not going to say that this place is outright terrible, because it's an edible burger, but aside from being new and still spotless, this place is inferior to it's nearest competitor (the Chuckbox) in almost every way: it costs quite a bit more, the burgers are good but nothing great, the chicken tasted quite good (but a tiny piece of meat on the bun for a $6 sandwich), the fries were garbage, there's no free parking, and it just has nothing special going for it."}
{"text":"The food is ok which is why the two instead of one star. The problem is the wait, even after you pay you are not going to be waiting any less than 20 minutes. Pretty sure they kill the cows and butcher them after you order."}
{"text":"I love....The chili dog its sooo good. 5 stars because its clean and the staff are delightful and they cater to you :)"}
{"text":"This place makes a mighty fine burger - love the local variation and recognition such as the Sin City Burger - only gets better if they add an old school Royale with Cheese."}
{"text":"Went today and had the mushroom truffle butter Swiss it was great.  If you like hot juicy burgers this is the place to go.  Also you should try their smash fries."}
{"text":"I much prefer the Smashburger at Desert Ridge.  This place needed a little bit of help."}
{"text":"This post is from my last trip to Las Vegas. It was supposed to be \"No Meat March,\" but obviously it didn't turn out that way. When I am on vacation it pretty much an all you can eat time. I absolutely enjoy trying new places and cannot resist temptation; therefore, out with \"No Meat March\" and in with Smash Burger! It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog."}
{"text":"A year later, much better service. Ordered pretty much the same thing as last time but added a shake and it came to $22.10. 

Kind of expensive for a couple of burgers with fries. My four dollar, thirty-nine cent shake came in an eight ounce cup. Sad. It was tasty, just expensive. 

Service was cheerful and efficient. They added a rewards club (finally) so that should help."}
{"text":"Updated review: Have returned to this location a few times and it has improved. The food is always correct and staff are friendly.
AVOID THIS PLACE AROUND LUNCH.
Tried calling in an order, asked to hold which is totally fine. The employee put the phone down on the counter and continued to take orders, me hearing everything, and left me there for over 5 minutes, never taking my order.
When I hung up and called back, of course no one answered!
Probably will order from the Elliott location from now on."}
{"text":"Just had my first Smashburger; very good burger, not a fan of their shoe string french fries... their sweet potato fries are way better!"}
{"text":"So the fries are bomb! Reminds me of a burger joint I ventured to often living overseas. I wanna say Beastie Burgers in South Bank in Australia. They put rosemary on their fries. They were thick cut though. I like thick cut fries better... if you like the skinny fries then you'll like this joint. 

I had the Carolina Classic... which was decent. Dude at the restaurant told me that he put a fork in my bag because the burger can be pretty messy with the chili. Welp! Guess someone forgot to make it extra messy that night because the chili was perfectly contained... and he forgot the fork. 

My dude had some chicken burger. It wasn't memorable. 

I also had a chocolate cookies and cream shake. It was aight. 

Still can't touch Bad Daddy's... I go hard for a bean burger. That's saying something if I prefer their bean burger over this place beef burgers. Perhaps it was the prices too. Eh... at least I can say I tried it."}

Ambiance: 3/5
Overall experience: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

HULK SMASH Burger! RAWR!!! Smash Burger is yet another US burger chain that has landed on Canadian soil. Smash burger uses fresh angus beef that is smashed and cooked on the flat top which seals in the flavour and forms a tasty crust. Bonus... they also serve beer in frosty mugs ($3.99)!

I often see Smash Burger packed at lunch, but it was pretty slow when I went on a rainy Friday night. Right when you walk in, there is a pile of menus for you to view which I found very convenient. Dividers guide you towards the cash registers to order and on the other side is a spacious dining area. The décor is nothing too fancy. It was plain and simple with tan/creamy coloured walls and red booths. There was plenty of seating and a large area at the front to wait for takeout.

The bulk of their Calgary menu consists of beef hamburgers [single ($5.99); double ($6.99)] and chicken sandwiches (~$8.00+); sides like fries ($3.00), poutine ($3.99), chili ($3.99); salads ($6.49);  Haagen-Dazs shakes ($4.99);  and hotdogs ($5.49). 

You can either order set hamburger/sandwich combos or make your own which I did. I created a double patty ($6.24) with a whole wheat bun, goat cheese (+$0.75), Smash sauce which is like a tangy thousand island sauce, and all the veggies (lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, fresh jalapenos, spinach, and cucumbers). I also tried their mushroom poutine ($3.99) with garlic sautéed mushrooms, cheese curds, and poutine gravy.  

I'm not sure what it's like on a busy day, but ordering took awhile with only two cash registers. Afterwards, they give you a number and servers bring you your food when it's ready. The wait was a little longer than expected, but I was really impressed by the quality of the burger when it came out. For the amount of toppings I got, I was expecting everything to be plopped on hap-hazardly but everything was layered neatly - nearly picture perfect! 

HOWEVER, my biggest turn off was that the temperature of the food was nearing 'cool' to slightly warm - as if it sat out too long in the window. I was expecting a steaming hot burger and fries. The first bite of the burger was excellent and everything tasted so fresh! It was really messy though! had to double up on napkins. The poutine was very disappointing though... their fries were cut very thinly and wasn't crispy enough (kind of limp). The gravy was mediocre and cold so it didn't quite melt the cheese curds enough.

Overall, Smash Burger is a pretty decent place to go if you want a \"quick\" bite without feeling guilty."}
{"text":"Eating here on a Tuesday night at 830pm. Cashier is friendly and greeted me right when I walked in. I don't frequent this place very often so I don't know the menu well, however the menus kept changing in the electronic screens behind the cashier. How annoying! Just as I was reading a description it changed to something else. You guys need to stop that make the menus static. The cashier asked me if I wanted everything on it that it comes with, I struggled to find the item I ordered again because of the changing menus. 

Second major issue is that the restaurant is dirty. Tables are gross and need to be cleaned. The beverage station is filthy and needs wiped down. Lemons were old and wilted. Cup lids laying all over. Seriously where is the boss telling employees to clean the place up?

The food wasn't bad. They serve string fries which are not my favorite, I prefer thicker fries, but the are crisp and taste good. The burger was very salty. I like salt so it was ok for me, but I could see how it could easily be too salty for others. 

Last was the price. $11.50 for a burger combo is too much for how mediocre the food is. Value is definitely not there for the experience."}
{"text":"For an authentic burger flavor, order the meat without butter and seasoning, it also makes it healthier. We enjoy the options to build your own, with a variety of veggies, sauces and cheeses to choose from. The burgers are juicy and flavorful. We like the black bean burger too. The veggie frites are too greasy for us so we usually skip the side or get sweet potatoes fries that don't SEEM as greasy but probably are"}
{"text":"Not the best burger you'll ever eat but you get a good quality one and great fries at a reasonable price. I like sticking to the classic. If I had known my bun would be smeared with a mustard base I would have requested it not to be and given 5 stars but live and learn..."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 bacon cheese burgers. I ordered the rosemary fries and a salted camel milkshake. The burgers were a step above Burger King's but twice the price. My fries were good, but the very, very thin shoestring kind deep fried in healthy evo oil, which I hate because it leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth that tastes lie poison.  My shake was good, but that is all. Even with a 2 dollar off coupon given to us by a server before we left, will not return."}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible, Service.  Employees who don't care.  Argumentative manager..  Took 7 minutes to order, still didn't get it right.  Was told that we, not they made the mistake.  Have eaten at a lot of Smashburgers this by far the worse location.  Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"I went in and placed a $40.00 order.. Very simple.. I ready it item by item. They got the food right. Except they failed to cook my chicken. The inside of the chicken was about a raw as the chicken in my fridge. Of course because it was with lettuce tomato onion and jalapeños I did not notice this until I only had about 2 bites left. It was disturbing. I called the location and spoke to a manager.. A I got was sorry and we will comp you next sandwich or we can refund it. Great!!!! Then she admitted to me that her cooks do NOT always check the temp of chicken before serving it. Do NOT eat chicken from here. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"I have tried to give these guys the benefit of the doubt but they just aren't for me. Both times the bun was soggy and the fries weren't what I had hoped for. There are just too many other options to chance the poor level of quality they put out."}
{"text":"We come here a lot and always great people working. We waited at the front for only a few minutes... Matt came and helped take our order and apologized for our 2-3 min wait. 
We assured him it wasn't too long of a wait, but Matt insisted we accept a voucher for a free entree for our waiting at the front for a couple minutes! Great service & shows that they really care about their service & customer experience!!! Thanks Matt!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Worst I've ever dealt with, it was truly unbelievable.  Management needs to get a little more strict on the hiring.  Foods good, but risking dealing with this again, not worth it."}
{"text":"While the burger tastes amazing... EVERYTHING has gluten in it.  Even the spices. There is huge risk for cross contamination with this place, and when I went the first (and likely the last) time, I was glutened pretty hard, even bunless.

But... with that said... for other people who don't have to worry about that issue, it's AWESOME.  The burger is HUGE.

I was visiting with friends who were eating there, and found that they have a half size, if your stomach isn't big enough to handle the full thing. :)"}
{"text":"I liked the smushed burger. It's crispy, and I enjoy things that are crispy. Staff is friendly, place is clean. Good fast food place that doesn't have a drive thru."}
{"text":"Decent burgers but a little pricey. My son had the classic burger combo and I had a grilled chicken sandwich, fries, and a soda. I have no complaints about my sandwich. It was a super thin piece of chicken but it was still juicy and flavorful. I stole my sons pickles for some added zing. The fries are super thin. Tasty but too thin to hold the ketchup. My son liked his burger. He ordered it with everything and then picked it all off for some reason.

Lunch for the two of us was about $23.00. That just seems a bit high for me for what we got."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with a good interior design.  Good service.  But the burgers and onion strings were mediocre at best.  And on the pricey side.  IMO, even the premium burgers at Carl's Jr. are better and less expensive.  The onion strings order was small and very greasy too."}
{"text":"I love their classic smashburger and the smashfries are the bomb! The shoestring fries is seasoned with olive oil and rosemary! It's a must try! 
The guy who was on register was super friendly and funny. He provided great customer service and even gave us 2 coupons! Awesome food and customer service."}
{"text":"The food is decent and the smash fries are awesome but the service at this location sucks. I've been two or three times now and I don't think they've ever gotten my order 100% correct. Got a burger and it came with two tiny slivers of onion. Asked for a side of onion at the counter and it had to go through a telephone game of like, four people."}
{"text":"The burgers are like Steak n Shakes, but on roids. Same concept on the meat, they beat it down while they cook it. 

I like the burgers and their Rosemary fries. It's just outside UNLV, next to In and Out. I prefer it over In and Out and Stake n Shake, but I have been spoiled by Fukuburger and I go there almost exclusively for my burger fix, as they're always around my house."}
{"text":"Gluten-free burger that isn't a lettuce wrap? Awesome! This location is never busy when I go so it's easy to get your food. This is my go to for real burgers. And I'm always craving their sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Super frustrating, waited 45 minutes for a single burger. And when asked what was taking so long the employee rolled her eyes and said we're understaffed.  Not good management all the way around. Too busy for my business. I could've grabbed lunch at a sitdown restaurant for how long it took."}
{"text":"I went there again today and this time had the Sin City smashburger..... It was just as good as the Spicy Baja burger, the Sin City had bacon, an egg, lettuce, cheese, and crispy onions. It makes me want to go try another item off the menu soon."}
{"text":"This place is YUMMY, the choice of a whole wheat bun gives it extra points. I wish there was a Smashburger in durango, co .... Oh well until that time I will continue to eat at this wonderful burger place in the PHX Airport!"}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend and needed a quick lunch. I had the Arizona burger and the rosemary garlic fries. All around a good burger and fries at a good price. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The Walgreens that my partner and I use to get our prescriptions is within rock-throwing distance of this Smashburger location, except we would only throw them bouquets instead! For a chain restaurant, we have yet to experience a lousy burger here. The BBQ Bacon burger is always on-point, and that's besides the fact that bacon makes everything better, anyway! I try to restrain myself from having one of their reDONKulous thick shakes with it, though when I do, that counts as dessert.  The substantial salads help fill you up and are always freshly prepared. If there was one thing that costs them a star, however, it's that when we've been in lately, the Smashfries seem to be pretty light on the rosemary and garlic, which is what makes them so unique and addictive.  I sure hope they haven't made any radical changes to the recipe for those.  Other than that, applause, applause!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Smashburger this evening!  The dinner was delicious and Andrea is an amazing employee.  Our son's shake spilled, and she quickly cleaned up the mess and brought him another one!  Great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Would have given them 5 stars but no matter how nice the manager Ryan was, he gets minus 1 star for admitting to being a Dodger's fan.  Lol!!!  

This was our first meal upon landing for my birthday weekend in Vegas.  The fam bam loved the burgers & fries here.  We can't wait until they open up one in the East Bay, preferably Fremont, Newark or Union City. Smash fries are so good...addicting.  The burgers were also very tasty.  The hubby loved his Sin City Burger.  Probably because it was topped with a fried egg!  Ha!  Perfect for hangovers.  My daughter and I got the Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burgers.  Yum-O!!!  Definitely a 5 star meal complete with an awesome manager who was extremely friendly and would check on us and the other customers.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Tthis place is sex. Smash fries in and around my mouth. end rant, you're welcome."}
{"text":"The food is good. Fresh ingredients. Small servings though. I got a big sized Baja Burger and added Bacon. The meat patty only got bigger but the bun did not. Don't get me wrong, i shouldn't have even eaten the bun or fries LOL but, it was messy to eat bc you couldn't get an entire appropriate bite with all the ingredients until you got past much of the meat patty that was sticking out first. Food was still good. I am deducting stars because of their lack of cleanliness. I went there last night and almsot slipped from a greasy spot on the floor. My husband took a really bad fall at The Habit Burger in California for the same reason- greasy floors. I was wearing heels bc it was shortly after work. Luckily i didn't fall, but my eyes were drawn to every inch of the floor and it was greasy, dirty, food all over. I walked all around the restaurant floor except the bathrooms and employee area. They are asking for slips & falls because their staff doesn't take cleaning their floors seriously. It disgusted me. It also scared me bc I almost fell and my husband had fallen and hurt himself badly due to the same conditions. I had to walk very cautiously through the restaurant bc i was afraid to slip on their nasty floors. I know some of the staff are young and they may dismiss mopping the floors. I get it, I worked at INNOUT burger in my youth. But clean floors is a SAFETY issue. Plus, if you keep your restaurant this dirty- what does your kitchen look like? I know it's just a burger joint, but the staff should take some pride in their work. Be the best employee you can be, not for the sake of your company or career but for yourself. Clean floors are very important!!! I always went to the Fort Apache location. Their staff was super friendly and their store was much cleaner. I miss that location. I only come to the Sahara location bc it's the next closest to me."}
{"text":"I guess everyone complains about the fries, i thought they were good but maybe they could change? Awesome service! Clean restaurant and cool spot to hang out on a laptop or something!"}
{"text":"The food is very good here but the staff of what makes this place. I am handicapped and they always help me and bring my food to me. They are very thoughtful. The manager is always asking if there is anything else he can do. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the 1/3 burger on a multi grain bun with blue cheese, jalapeno, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes. Plus fried pickles. Then I get the drink in a to-go cup. Fresh brewed ice tea. Great haagen daus shakes."}
{"text":"My first time in a Smashburger and I was very impressed! I got fried pickles for myself and shared a burger and fries with my friend. Everything was awesome and I was also impressed by two employees, Chorde and I think the girl's name was Char. They both took the time to come out and talk to us during the down time, an awesome and unexpected touch especially in a fast food place."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Been there several times. Walk up and order then they deliver to your table.   They do a good job here.  A bit long to get your food sometimes but not bad."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in here for the first time and had a great experience. The guy at the counter was friendly and offered great service and our food came out in a timely manner. My wife got the avocado club burger and says it was good. She liked the bun especially. I got the buffalo blue cheese burger and really enjoyed it. The only thing was that it didn't have as much blue cheese as I would have wanted. We both ordered the smash fries and really enjoyed them. We ended our night with a butterfinger shake which was delicious."}
{"text":"This is freshly made hamburgers, but I did not find them extra-ordinary.  It is not your typical fast food.  Unless I am with someone else, I may go.  I did like add your own ingredients for what you want. Service was fine."}
{"text":"This location used to be a FatBurger, come back!

I came here with my wife figuring we would get a great burger.
The person serving behind the counter was nice, but that was the end of the good experience..

The burgers were extremely greasy! So were the fries..
My wife's bun was completely soaked in grease making it very unappealing. 
Tables wren't cleaned either.

I will not be coming back here again, visit the In'n'Out in the same mall, or Island burgers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Staff is friendly and the service was great. Now to the burgers, FRESH! The bread was very soft, cheese melted to perfection and the ingredients(tomatoes, onions etc) were fresh. None of that pickled crap. Gourmet burger for mc donald price. I encourage everyone to try this place."}
{"text":"I went to Smashburger today.  It was their second day of being open.  No one was there because of the Superbowl.  The interior is modern and sleek for fast food.  I like that they made the effort for that.  I felt comfortable.  I ordered the AZ Smashburger.  It comes with habanero chile cheese, chipotle mayo, and jalapenos along with all the standard fixings.  I ordered the Smash fries.  They are drenched in olive oil and are seasoned with rosemary.  To drink, I had a Cherry Coke.  That was a nice surprise at the soda fountain.  My burger was good, not great.  You can choose from a third or half pound burger.  I went with the third.  My fries were wet.  They tasted okay.  I compare rosemary fries with Fez's rosemary fries.  Smashburger's are lacking.  The oil is a bit much and for some reason they were not salty enough.  They were bland wet fries.  I will go back to Smashburger.  I will choose it over Mac Donald's or Burger King.  They are hip and with the times.  They sell beer too.  The staff was young and fresh faced.  They were very upbeat.  They were playing cool music too.  I will be back.  Three stars because after all it is a burger joint."}
{"text":"There's some things I really like about this burger joint but I think it misses the mark on a couple items.

The burgers are tasty and they have a great selection of options to build your own burger or you can order one of the specialty burgers. They even offer wheat buns which really appealed to me, but the bun doesn't stand up very well to the juicy burger and it's always falling apart by the end. One cool gimmick they have is a specialty burger that highlights the local area. In this case they have an Arizona burger which features jalapenos and guacamole. The first time I got the burger there were only 4 jalapeno slices on it, so the next time I made sure to order extra jalapenos and this time I got 6 slices! So yeah, they apparently are a little stingy on the toppings.

My biggest disappointment with this place is their fries. The rosemary spices are a nice twist which I enjoyed but the fries themselves were very average. I asked just to make sure and they confirmed my suspicions that the fries are frozen. Come on, if Five Guys and In-N-Out can cut their own fries, a higher end burger joint like this should be able to also. You could opt for their onion strings instead which the counter girl did tell me where made fresh at the restaurant. They were pretty good but probably not the healthiest choice in the world.

Overall, I like the place but don't make it a point to go there. I'm really disappointed that the fries weren't better (i.e. not frozen) because I can really tell the difference."}
{"text":"This newest location of SmashBurger in the greater Cincinnati area is located in the new mini-strip on 27 near NKU with Chipotle, Jimmy John's, etc. We tried it mostly because it was in the neighborhood, but I love a good burger as much as the next person so was hoping for a new local (albeit chain) favorite.

The building is brand new, so everything is clean and new inside as well. The staff is obviously still being trained (reciting the SmashBurger intro from a script when you step up to order), but friendly and accommodating enough. 

I ordered a small (1/4 lb) 'create your own' burger and haystack onions. Plentiful enough topping options, but pretty standard condiments overall. I did like the different bun options, including a multi-grain option. All sides are a la carte and include regular and 'smash' fries, fried pickles, haystack onions, etc. There are also a regular (1/3 lb) and large (1/2 lb) burger options.

I was expecting onion rings, but the haystack onions are more like a pile of 'onion straw' garnish--super skinny onion rounds, which weren't quite as satisfying as actual onion rings, but tasty enough (as long as you leave the bottom grease-sodden layer). 

The burger was fair--nothing too special and I didn't really get the supposed 'smashed' quality of the patty; just seemed like a standard burger to me. Basically, I finished it, but wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. Last critique, on everything served, I found it all to be extremely over-salted."}
{"text":"I went in on a Sunday at 2:16 pm, there were about 6-7 people standing around waiting for their food ahead of me.  It took awhile for someone to acknowledge me and take my order which was a bacon burger and a chicken club and 2 smash fries.   I took a seat because of the people waiting ahead of me...and I waited until 2:55...other TO GO customers were complaining how long it was taking.  39 minutes...for two burgers.  I got home and opened my order and I got a club burger...no chicken.  I ate it, but I will NEVER be back to this location.  I don't care if they just opened...the parking sucked, I had to back into a spot because there is no room to pull in normally.  I could of had a sit down dinner with full service in that amount of time.  Get it together people, you only have 1 chance to make a first impression.  There was one order sitting there, they called out the lady's name multiple times and nobody ever came to get it, probably got mad and left...and even once the employees saw nobody picking up the order, another employee made two milk shakes to go with the order...so if the lady had been there to pick it up, the shakes were not ready and then were made AFTER it was discovered she was not in the store to take the order home.  So I am sure those were wasted.  I am sorry..it was a great big MESS."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty! Nothing fancy but definitely worth the price.

Love the ambience. Friendly staff. Bathrooms were clean.

I had the buffalo blue cheese burger and smash fries.

Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place failed before I even placed an order.  The time it took to even place the order was akin to waiting in line for space mountain on a weekend, minus a fast pass. Once my afternoon was sufficiently wasted standing in line while the inexplicably solo girl behind the counter feverishly tried to make shakes, take orders, and deliver food, I managed to place an order. Sin city, buffalo fries. 
The Buffalo fries are interesting, I probably would have enjoyed them had they not been salted like they were being prepared for jerky. My assumption is that the tears that fell on them from the poor girl who was lamenting not doing better in school had a great deal to do with this. 
The burger was good. Not bad. Not great. Good, if a lil flavorless. I think the assault of salt from my initial dive into the fries might have desensitized my buds. 
Save yourself the frustration.  There's a 5 guys a couple of doors down. Their fries aren't as flashy but you won't feel like committing arson either."}
{"text":"First time to ever have a smashburger, needless to say I was not disappointed. One of the best burgers I've ever had and the fries were equally as impressive."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. The fries are also just as great. The staff were friendly and the place was nice and clean."}
{"text":"For $40 I'd expect them to get my order right. My hubby hates onions and I wanted extra guacamole on mine. Of course my hubby and I didnt order the same thing, but they removed the onion and added the guac onto the opposite burgers. The burger itself was not seasoned (a lil salt and pepper goes a LONG way) and the fries were nothing exceptional. Just seemed like a lot of money for something so average with bad service."}
{"text":"I've decided to up the rating of this place to 3 stars because I went back for a second try. (it was close to work)  This time the burger actually had juices left.  They still wont cook it less then well done which puts me off but at least it had flavor this time.

I still dont recommend this place when you can spend a bit more and get a real burger at FEZ, Zinburger or Delux."}
{"text":"The burgers are good.  We ate on the patio with our dog.  The staff was very nice"}
{"text":"Once we discovered this place we haven't went to any other burger joint. It never fails how fast they are. Within 10 min I get my order. There salads are huge and delicious. Chicken burgers are so delicious. The staff is amazing. My husband loves there burgers ..this is his first choice  place to go in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great food!

I've been here a couple of times and i really enjoy the food! The people at the register are nice, its a fair wait for our food but well worth the wait, and has a great concept/design, and the place is really clean. I come here with family and friends and this is my first suggestion when someone asks for a great place to eat.
 The burgers are amazing and so are the fries. They are both different from many places but some have their similarities. The food is always cooked to perfection and tastes amazing after. I haven't tried much things on the menu but i'm open to new tastes."}
{"text":"What a disappointment this place is! Paper thin chicken breasts, oil soup french fries, screwed up order that you discover after you get home... Need I say more?!? AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE! IT HAS GONE TO HELL!!"}
{"text":"Everyone at smash burger was very friendly. They greeted me properly and promptly took my order. The food was not what I ordered along with being very well done."}
{"text":"Experience was great, staff was courteous food delicious and their fries yum yum. Brought my wife here for the first time she really enjoyed it and she's not a hamburger fan , ate the entire thing never seen that happen before."}
{"text":"Food's good the service was terrible. One cashier is very unhelpful. If you see the chick with blue hair wait for someone else. She's terrible."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this location is probably one of the best I have been to recently. Yet, the few changes are easily fixed and minor with one exception. Upon our arrival we were greeted by very pleasant young lady who was making milk shakes. We waited for about 4 to 5 minutes until she called someone else over to assist in taking our order because she was still making the shakes. The gentleman who assisted us was very helpful. 
My husband ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich which at one time they had removed from the menu. He was pleasantly surprised and happy to have it back. I ordered a veggie burger western style. 
This is were I think things could use some improvements. The chicken sandwich was great! My veggie/ bean burger was awful!! The bean pattie was just that, mashed black beans and nothing else. It was like mashed eating beans out of can or baby food. Very little flavor except for the bbq sauce I had added and nothing else. I ended up just eating my fries and nothing else. If they don't change their veggie burgers to compete with other competitors than I feel they will loose business. I definitely won't be returning, my husband yes."}
{"text":"always solid... I don't understand how they can charge a dollar for PBR and olympia and 2.49 for a fountain drink... but its always good"}
{"text":"Why are there two registers?? Why? Never once have I seen both being used even when the line is out the door. Still giving a good rating because I love the food but ordering takes 10 years. Open another damn register!!"}
{"text":"You people cannot all be serious....

After being lured in by the clean signage (which looks remarkably similar to gamestop... in fact this is originally how we found out about this place...) the simple menu, and a decent smell I must admit I am completely dissapointed.

Court ordered a 1/3 while I splurged for the 1/2 pound burger, we mixed it up with sweet potato fires, and onion strings what we found was the following.

Every person who eats here must be;

Fat and used to having to dig around the grease pool our burgers were swimming in.
Stupid by being conned into paying $25 dollars (we shared a drink) for $5 worth of burger materials and $2 worth of the measliest portion of fries possible....

My 1/2 pound burger was flat as a pancake and had literally 2 inches of meat in a ring around the bun.....slothered with a sickening sweet BBQ sauce, cheese and a single onion string, it had completley (I mean literally) soaked both sides of the bun with grease to the point where I removed the bun and squeezed it our as you might ring out a towel.....gross.  The onion strings were okay for pre bought stuff, you can get the same thing at chilis except they charge $1 less and actually strain them before serving.

Courts burger at least fit the bun (points for that) but was salty as anything which suggests they are keeping the meat way longer than they should......same issues with the grease.....literally I feel acne growing on my face just thinking about it....

The sweet potato fries were uninspired and greasy again, I have never had a bad sweet potato fry until yesterday......I guess it had to happen sooner or later.

I must admit after eating at literally hundreds of burger joints this is by far the worst which is sad because there is major potential

We got about halfway through our meal before we couldn't stomach it anymore....I have a stomach of iron....and felt sick all day after eating just 1/4 of a burger and a few onion strings and fries.....

Main Complaints;

Grease and Ingredients
Measly portions of sides (for $3 a side I would expect more....)
Smallest Drinks I have ever seen ($3 for a 'Large' for what McDonalds calls a small.... come on people)

Long story short if this was my only option I would starve.....best of luck to all you facing this grease burger the only thing I wanted to smash after finishing was my face into a toilet bowl....."}
{"text":"Our family likes Smashburger, but this location is subpar.  The beef patties were dry and the onion haystacks were really soggy and greasy.  I went to throw out the box of haystacks and there was a big pool of grease left on the table."}
{"text":"Last week I stopped in for a classic smash in beef. It was very good. Today I tried the black bean classic. Yea it sounds weird. I wasn't sure what to expect. But it looked like a meat patty and even though the texture is different and you can taste the beans it actually has a very good flavor. I was shocked at how good it tasted. I would definitely try again."}
{"text":"Daniel was a very big help. Very knowledgeable about the menu and he gave a great recommendation for the truffle mushroom burger and the BBQ bacon cheddar burger. This is very classy place. If your hungry for a good hamburger this is definitely the place to come. The food was definitely great. Also the service was fantastic very quick and getting out the hamburgers and a salad we ordered."}
{"text":"My far my fave burger place! I consider myself a hamburger aficionado! Smashburger is alway fresh and those smash fries are to die for. I usually choose it as a cheat meal due to the grease content but it's worth every drip of sweat I have to work it off. The Haagen das  milkshakes are thick and remind you of the old shake shops. This location is great when the weather allows you to dine outside. Im loving the option to order and pay online as well. They have a pickup line and you just show your idea grab food and leave."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Smashburger a few times and I'm always pleased with my food and the friendliness of the staff.  On my most recent visit, I called ahead to pick up my family's order and we were not disappointed, once again.  We ordered a variety of menu items (and in typical 'When Harry Met Sally...' style) - a grilled chicken spinach and goat cheese sandwich (subbing the goat cheese for American & changing the multigrain bun to egg), a build-your-own burger with an egg bun, spicy chipotle mayo, pickles and onions, an order of Smashfries, an order of french fries and an order of fried pickles.  Everything was made perfectly to order and plenty of extra sauces (ranch, etc;) were provided without having to ask.  
On weekends, this shop is jam packed and it's a wait to get a table, but worth it.  During the week, everything flows very smoothly and the vultures \"circling\" for booths is at a minimum.  
I highly recommend this Smashburger location whether dining in or taking taking your meal on the go."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!  Fresh and tasty. 
Service isn't the greatest. Katrina at the register acts like she's doing you a favor by taking your order and has an attitude."}
{"text":"Better than that 5 place in my opinion. We ordered the original burger with fries.  Very tasty! Loved the shoestring fries as well. Service was very quick, attentive, friendly and not a long wait to get the order. Regarding some of the other reviews: it seems that people sometimes complain about shoestring fries not being fat enough? Rosemary fries being too much rosemary, etc. This is why I don't order anything but the original menu my first time out. I also evaluate on what the menu says. Shoestring fries are shoestring fries. Won't go to those other burger places in the area now except for Carl's which has a GREAT burger."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this location. Each and every time I have visited this location my order is wrong. I decided to give it one more try on 4/5/18 and  again, not a good visit. I placed my order at 6:40pm. All the food came out except the tots. I asked several times for them and finally got them 25 min. later. Unfortunately we were all done eating our meals and ready to go. There is never any utensils available, condiments are always empty, and the floors are always very dirty. Won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Smashburger uses high quality ingredients but everything feels saturated with grease. The fries are particularly bad. They glimmer with oil and on the way down taste like it too. Not ideal for either a budget conscientious or health concerned person."}
{"text":"Great customer service and food. My husband and I meet here regularly for lunch since it is located smack dab in the middle of each of our work places. The food is fresh and delicious. I have tried a number of items, but my favorite is the buffalo and blue chicken sandwich (I ask for a whole grain bun instead of the egg bun). My husband usually orders the special burger of the moment. We are always satisfied with the food sometimes we bring the kids on the weekend. They like it too and they are harder to please. 
 The employees are super friendly and helpful and make sure to they get your order right which is important if you are like me and always have special requests (I can be so annoying). I would give this place 5 stars if the fries weren't too salty and they were just a little bit faster  at cleaning tables as people leave and not letting the trash overflow."}
{"text":"First time there on a very busy Friday nite.  Long line and long wait for food.  But the food was hot and fresh and the burger was great.  The manager also checked in with me which was nice.  They do need to pay attention to cleaning tables even when busy but overall it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"So so. I expect more from smashburger, they always seem to overcook it here and not do it the proper smashburger way, I know what amount of searing and juicy taste they are supposed to be, watch the company YouTube to see for yourself.

Perhaps just the location, other smashburgers have been grand. We keep coming back for the shakes which they consistently do right."}
{"text":"My wife and I were invited to the pre-grand opening thing here last night.  It was pretty much like I expected; free food, pretty busy, etc., etc.

The actual location is very nice, very new and very clean so no complaints there.  Their entire staff from the people running the event to the managers to the cashier were all very fast, friendly and helpful.

I didn't really know what to make of this place.  Is it fast food?  Is it a nice, sit-down type of place?  I think it is a small, more \"upscale\", \"boutiquey\" Fudruckers.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing.  Just saying that is what I thought of the place.  

Anyway, about the food:

* Smashwedge Salad - my wife and I shared this and it was very good.  Very odd though (in a good way) for a fast food place.

* Classic Smashburger - Excellent.  Perfectly juicy and tasty.  Definitely one of the best fast food burgers I've tasted.  You can see and taste that the ingredients were very fresh.

* Smashfries and Sweet Potato Smashfries = No bueno!!!  I was really looking forward to eating these, but I didn't think they were very good at all.  I just do not enjoy rosemary on my fries.  French fries shouldn't taste like soap or something.  I don't know - maybe I'm just not fancy enough to like random herbs on my fries.  At the very least they could have went farther down fancy lane and provided some aioli which would have been nice.  Next time I'm going to hold the flowers and order regular fries for sure.

I know I wasn't paying but I feel this place is overpriced.  An average of $6-$7 for a burger or chicken sandwich seems a bit high.  By the time you add fries and a drink you are over $10 which is way high for a fast food place.

I really wanted to try the veggie frites but they were out so maybe next time I'll give them a whirl.  I may give the fried pickles a shot as well because I am very curious as I had never tried one before.

Anyway, my first Smashburger experience was a pleasant one and I would like to return to get another burger, try their regular fries, get some veggie frites and maybe a fried pickle."}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time before I head into work... The Buffalo SmashChicken with Fried Pickles on the side. And of course a Kilt Lifter in a frozen MUG. Please Thank You.

The little wire trays my meal come in reminds me of a cleaner version of the way Corban's serves their burgers (minus the reused white napkin - I don't know about you but it is odd to me)

They have a sad little tip jar by the register that has tennis in it. The wait staff is cute. So tip the boys..."}
{"text":"Another day, another two-star rating on a recommendation from my GF. I'm beginning to see a pattern LOL...

Four years ago I didn't like Smashburger. Last night I didn't like Smashburger. I got the Jalapeno Baja Burger (I think that's what it's called...) I'm not sure what it is about this place that I just don't like. The burgers aren't terrible but I feel like they have no....zing (?) to them. I kinda-sorta enjoyed my burger last night but only because I smothered it in ketchup and mustard. I feel as though a burger that has fresh jalapenos, guacamole, pepper jack cheese, and some kind of chipotle sauce should pack a little more flavor and it just didn't.

Other than the food, the staff was good - friendly, patient. 

The one thing I would come back for though is a shake. OMG they're so good. They have the usual flavors, plus Nutter Butter, PB & J, and Butterfinger. Also, this place sells alcohol."}
{"text":"I love burgers. This place is great but to far for me to go"}
{"text":"I stopped by this location last night on the way from dropping my husband off at work. I had the dog with me so I didn't want to be in long, so I placed an online order so I could just walk in and get it. I came in 20 mins after the order was placed and it wasn't done. There were maybe 2 people ahead of me but the employees seemed mostly new so it wasn't a big deal that it wasn't ready.  When I finally got my food I left and checked the food in the car and found out I got the wrong burger.  Again, the employees seemed new and mistakes happen so no big deal. I went in and asked for the right sandwich. It took some time to get the kid at the counter to understand what to do, but eventually he got it. He went back to ask to have my sandwich made again and the manager Tony comes storming up demanding to know what was wrong. I explained again that i got the wrong sandwich but they were remaking it. Instead if accepting that, tony brought me over to the screen where they show the orders and condescendingly tells me about how the orders placed online show exactly what was ordered (I guess he was trying to accuse me of trying to rip them off). I let him know that the order on the screen was correct but the burger was still wrong. Eventually I got the correct thing but there was no reason to be rude about a freaking cheeseburger,  especially as a manager."}
{"text":"Good burger, but man it is greasy!  I guess thats what makes it good though, right?

Milkshake was pretty good too.  

Not my first choice for a burger joint, but I would eat here again."}
{"text":"First time visit. I got a classic on egg bun with cheddar, tomato, grilled onions, ranch, and mayo. Also ordered a small drink and reg fries. The fries were shoestring and I prefer the fatter ones but the real issue was that they were cold. I don't like any fries that aren't hot when they are put in front of me. Also, they brought my soda in a plastic glass so I could not take it with me when I left; normally I would ask for a to-go cup but they were so busy I couldn't be bothered. Just serve it in a paper cup and be done with it! Now, the burger - really good. I would not order the grilled onions again as they were cooked on a dirty grill and tasted weird. However, the meat was great along with all the other toppings, and the bun was delicious. Had to take off a star for the price though - $11 something for my meal. Ouch. I will try this place again to see if I can bump up the stars to four."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time ever. And it is fantastic!!! Amie was my cashier and she was super nice and friendly and had great suggestions. The food came out quickly and it was so delicious. I got the sin city burger. It was huge and amazing. I'm a little disappointed that they can't cook burgers less than medium well tho. That's the only reason they lost a star. The burger was juicy and delicious regardless tho. But once again in case smash burger reads this lol Amie is a fantastic employee. Will definitely be returning. Thanks Amie!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and always friendly! Please keep the western burger on the menu with those grilled jalapenos!!! Thru made one for me today, but I've been in before when thru said they couldn't. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Went there today with the family for the first time based on the great yelp review; well worth it!  The place is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food was excellent.  Definitely will go there again!"}
{"text":"Recently I had a Carolina chili burger. It was meaty, juicy and full of flavors. 
The veggie option for a burger is good too, as my wife is a pure veggie, when we are in mood of having a quick juicy bite, we do like this burger place."}
{"text":"Wow, it must cost lots of money to make a mediocre burger because they pass this cost on to you. This burger is like the kind our mom's use to force us to eat when they didn't want to take us out for a burger. The only thing it was missing to make it truly horrid was the Wonder Bread. Maybe they call it Smash Burger because you have to be drunk to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I went to the VIP Sneak Peak last night, and honestly, I wish I'd stayed home.

Yes.  I am a vegetarian, but my partner isn't, and she loves hamburgers, so I figured this would be a perfect way to show my love.  We didn't have to wait long for a booth, but ended up with one by the door that was absolutely FREEZING. We both had jackets on and were still shivering.

We went up in the line to order; she got an all american burger and smashfries.  I planned to get Smashfries, a side salad w/ no onions and a cactus vanilla shake. My friend had the veggie frites, and said they were awful, so I decided not to go that directions.

Apparently, the salads are pre made, and there is no way to get them without onions. I asked if maybe they were whole onions I could just take off. No, they were chopped.  Ok. Since they don't have ANY other veggie options (no veggie burger, no grilled cheese, no vegetarian full sized salad), I asked the cashier what she recommended for a vegetarian.  She told me this was not place for a vegetarian.

Was I offended? Yes.  While *I* am a vegetarian, my partner is not. We like to go to dinner together, and they've now lost both of our business.

Finally, I wound up spending 5 minutes negotiating with her to try and have an arizona cobb salad made without chicken, bacon, onions or jalapenos. She finally figured it out, and we went to go wait.

The wait was maybe 10 minutes, and then out came out food. The vanilla cactus shake tasted like a regular vanilla shake; nothing special.  The Smashfries were actually pretty good; I liked their seasoning...but Delux's sweet potato fries beat them any day.  And my salad? HA.  It was a GIANT bowl only half filled...with chopped iceburg, a hint of cheese, a few pieces of tomatoes, and less than a teaspoon of guacamole. I wish I had taken a picture, it was that ridiculous.  Plus, there were brown pieces of lettuce and the bases (the bottom of the lettuce that is hard and dirty) mixed in there. Sigh. And yes, even without any meat, it cost $6.99

I asked my partner about her burger.  She said it was \"ok.\"  I asked her to compare it.  She said it was worse than Red Robin, worse than Chili's, on par with Sonic and slightly better than Burger King. Ouch. That's a lot of money to pay for a burger on par with Sonic.  She did finish the burger, but didn't like the fries.

Will we be back? No.  The food is over price for a mediocre meal, and they have made it very clear that \"my kind\" (vegetarians) and their friends/partners are not welcome."}
{"text":"Great fresh smashed burgers made to order. We stopped in for lunch and ordered the classic smash and added an egg, and the sin city burger with smash fries. The smash sauce on the burgers is similar to thousand island but combined with the freshly made burger and the delicious toppings it comes together almost divinely. If you like spicy they have a jalapeño burger guaranteed to burn a bit. They also have sweet potatoes fries if you want to try something different.

I love the burgers at this place and has been in my lunch rotation for years, still continues to satisfy. If you come hungry, try the freshly made shakes, the Oreo one is amaze balls."}
{"text":"Great Food...service horrible, how long does it take to cook a burger..Here it was 20+ minutes at lunch time forgot to staff this place and they acted as though they were the only game in town...well is Las Vegas it's not..."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I have been here several times with my boyfriend and my experience is always the same. We agree the burgers are good (when we can receive our order correct, which has been never), but the cleanliness of the location always seems to be a challenge. Several times I have witnessed the cashier not only providing table service, but also buses the tables. Dining necessities such as napkins, utensils, and even soda lids become scarce. Trash cans over flow, restrooms become nasty, floors and tables are extremely dirty. 

 The kitchen staff always seems to be in a hurry not to cook the food, but to take their breaks. Food sits in the window for long periods of time and it seem like there is not any relief for the server (cashier). Therefore the food is delivered cold. Matter of fact too many times the burger is warm but the actual meat is cold. As soon as the kitchen staff orders lighten up, they seem to disappear. Sometimes it is very noticeable that there is one person in the kitchen while the others disappear out the back door. Not uncommon to see them from the street hanging out the back door or on the side patio. 

The frustrating problem is that I take a couple napkins off the table, walk over to the soda fountain to wet the napkins with water, always stepping on some part of the sticky floor, and then proceed to wipe my own table down from the crumbs and ketchup.Then it is only convenient for the server to say \"Oh, I am sorry I thought someone wiped down the table.\" and then displays a nervous smile. I usually just look back at the server and ask for napkins. 

If it wasn't for my boyfriend and nephew enjoying the food, we personally would not come back. Whether the restaurant is busy or not, customer service and cleanliness is important. I am pretty sure if the front of the restaurant displays complete laziness and lack of pride, then I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. It is obvious that  franchise, manager, and staff doesn't care."}
{"text":"Marco took our order and was very respectful and kind. I would refer anyone here just for their hospitality! Thank you Marco."}
{"text":"Upscale gourmet burger places are popping up all over the Valley.  Except this one is different!

I could write about how they are better than Coal Burger(?), Five Guys or ZinBurgers, but why do that -- since they did a much better job:

\"While most people are eating breakfast, we''re already doing lunch -- shaping fresh 100% Certified Angus Beef® into plump meatballs.  (When was our beef frozen, by the way?  Try never.)

\"Why meatballs, not patties?  Because unlike the other burger places, we don''t squish.  We smash.  Place your order and we spring into action, painting the grill with real butter, adding a dash of our secret spice blend, and smashing the meatball with a tool we invented ourselves (it''s so new, it doesn''t even have a name -- let''s just call it the smashing tool).

Okay, their corporate marketing aside, we had a very nice time here yesterday.  One of us ordered the large Smashburger Arizona, with Habanero cheese, quacamole, jalapeños on their spicy chipotle bun for $6.99(photo), along with the French Fries for $2.29(photo).  Ohh, was that good!

We also ordered the large Mushroom Swiss Smashburger for $6.99, and the Haystack Onions for $2.29.  Everything was outstanding and yummy.  

Yummy? Yes, yummy!  Like, why waste your time going somewhere else yummy!  Oh, yeah the bill for two came to $22.  Did I mention that Smashburger was an upscale gourmet burger place?  But that did include drinks and some sides.

I know that might be too Richie Rich$$ for some, so you can drive down FLW to In 'n Out and order it Animal Style.  But if you do, you will be missing an outstanding and delicious burger!  LOL

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's Smash Burger, which means it's great. This is my go-to fast food place. Any place that puts a fried egg on a burger is ok by me. I'd also highly recommend the Frank's Red Hot fries. They are great and just a little bit spicy. The service here is always fast and friendly and my order is always correct."}
{"text":"Okay so I know I said I wouldn't do takeout from them again but last night desperate times called for desperate measures lol.  I have to say the food was really good!! I don't know if I was just really hungry or if all the other times were off nights. However definitely a big improvement.

I however can only give them one more star because the service was just insanely bad!! I called in my order and not even two minutes later walked in to pay for it.  They had no recollection or record of the order. Seriously it was like 70 seconds??  The  manager just kind of stood around like he didn't even work there. I really wasn't impressed by that aspect but yay for the food tasting better!!"}
{"text":"Took my girls to smash burger for dinner last night. Food was good, above average, as usual. But the service was outstanding. I had a complicated order and a bunch of rowdy kids and they got it exactly right. It was a good experience and the kids loved the skinny fries and the milkshakes. The hamburgers are definitely worth going for."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here a few times for lunch, especially when I'm in the mood for some sweet potato fries.  They are ok more often than not, though I am not a big fan of the olive oil addition.  On my most recent trip I went for the \"big smash\" burger and instead of it being a bulkier patty, it just seemed like multiple patties were \"smashed\" together outward, making the burger itself considerably larger in circumference than the bun, making it awkward (and messy) to eat.

Still a decent place to grab a burger, but there are a couple other places I'd hit up before returning here."}
{"text":"The manager I
Chris is amazeballs!!!!! Seriously he is super friendly and gets the job done right really enjoyed smashburger the burgers are small but they gi e you enough fries to fill up on so that's a plus and the girl with white nails super friendly and attentive so kudos to her!! Plus she was hit with the dinner rush so yeah gi e that girl a raise"}
{"text":"You go to a burger place for the meat and this place doesn't disappoint. I was expecting the usual greasy but flavorful fare, BUT was thankfully wrong as the burgers are juicy but not dripping and the dual blended beef is very delicious! 

They also have great tasting bacon-cheese fries, hotdogs and dessert \"concretes\". Hopefully, we wont have to wait as long during our next visit, but the wait IS worth it either way."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and the burgers aren't even that great. The only good thing here is the fries and the lovely staff, other than that, I'd suggest going elsewhere. Their burgers taste the same as a McDonalds burger just with extra toppings. Ordered a couple drinks and a burger or two and I was already over 30 bucks. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now, and it's always a treat when I get to have their Smash Fries.  Lately, I've been ordering the Sin City Burger, as well as the Nutter Butter Shake. The staff are friendly and helpful, both important qualities that can make or break my experience from the get go. The food though, oh lordy, the food!

First, the burger.  Normally I try to get anything with egg on it, because eggs are wonderful and delicious, and this burger is awesome. breaded onions, onions, cheese, beef, bacon and an egg make up the components of this item, and I love it! I never finish it in one sitting, as I'm full by the time I'm halfway. It is amazing, I can't even elaborate further on it.

Second, the Nutter Butter milkshake. Quite possibly the greatest shake I've ever had in my life. It tastes exactly how you'd imagine it to be, the nutter butter flavor lingers after each swallow and it makes me happy.

I'm hopefully moving, and though this establishment is already fairly close to my home, the prospect of being a block or so away makes me giddy with excitement. If you haven't been here, you need to go."}
{"text":"could have been a 2 star rating because of the cleanliness, but realized that another chain burger joint charging $10 for an average burger didn't deserve it, especially when the burger is served with a side of sarcasm. not to mention that they are not community friendly at all. I asked to drop some flyers for the Grand Avenue Festival and they said no, not that they needed to say yes, but when I asked the manager to talk with the franchise managers about being a little more community involved and supportive; the manager barked very rudely \"none of the businesses around here do that\"; which was a lie because just next door on college- Port Of Subs and the Cupz Coffee both allow people to leave flyers for their customers, so did the Hawaiian place and almost every other business around. I had to give this a 1 star because Arizona doesn't need another over priced, community sucker, who is not interested in creating a community, but just bleeding the money and running. he was so unfriendly and sarcastic that I didn't even want to place my order after that. i'll stick with Maizie's burgers anyday! I also heard the Grind on Camelback Rd  next to the Fenix eatery at about 40th street was the shiznitz! They said its hands down the best in town....on my way soon."}
{"text":"Smash it to me, ! A pretty good spot to get my smash fix and it's pretty close to mi casa so i can frequent it more often. The sin city burger has to be my favorite something about that egg just sets it over the top. Second fav would have to be the windy city which was only around for a short while :(.. The beef is very good quality and burgers are always fresh and delicious. Sometimes when I feel like being a Benjamin glutton I upgrade to a 1/2 pound burger. The shakes they have are quite tasty and you get a free one on your birthday. You can also enroll in the smashclub which gives you points towards free stuff. The dinning area is usually clean and staff is very friendly. Be sure to check coupon sherpa on your phone to get $2 off your meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best burgers im town!  Service is excellent. I like the fact that they option as gluten free as my husband has a celiac and it isn't' easy for us to to find gluten free burger. I'm  not big on salads, but their Baja salad with chicken is simply amazing! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I lost my notes from this experience, but I do remember that I wouldn't go back.   I liked the cheeseburger okay, but there are just so many more that are betters.  They offer three sises.  What ruined it for me is that they have you put your condiments on.  I put too much on and their Smashburger brand ketchup came running out.  The pickles were really good and I would go back to try the fried pickles. The egg bun was good.  I needed more red onion slice.  I ordered the skinny salty  fries that I liked at first, but then they were just airy.  The young man working there, Anthony, is committed to making their burger the best.  Thank you for the great, warm hospitality."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill .  It's dirty, no one wipes down the tables anymore, I guess.  And today they have no ice.  NO ice.  Wth?"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the ruckus is about, as they do burgers, nothing fancy.  The fries are amazing (which is good for at least a star), but everything else is just OK."}
{"text":"As my friends and I were going to a movie today, they wanted to stop in to Smashburger for lunch. As I wasn't very hungry I ordered their regular Smashburger. When it was brought to the table it looked like a normal size bun, but when I picked up the top I discovered a tiny burger. It was tasty but very small and for six bucks a pretty bad deal. Burger 21 is a better deal and a better burger and Bad Daddys, while noisy and not inexpensive, is a far better burger. No more Smashburger visits for me."}
{"text":"GREAT burgers!  I would rate this burger place as one of top 5 in the valley - it is that good.  I have been to this store at least 2 dozen times and consistently get a great burger.  NEVER had a bad experience.

Note:  There are several Smashburgers in the valley and I have been to two other stores and not all Smashburgers are the same.  The Avondale store is the best of the three that I've been to.  Nicer staff, better food, cleaner store and better service.  I know, they should all be the same but they're not, trust me.  (The Lake Pleasant & Happy Valley store is the worse)."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I love Smashburger.  That being said, I can tell you that not all Smashburger locations are created equal.  This particular location does not live up to the standards of just about every other Smashburger store anywhere.

I went with wife and another couple and it was their treat because I'd helped them get their new Kindle set up and we thought it would be a good idea to check out the newly opened Smashburger at Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant Rd.

Very disappointing considering that we drove from Buckeye to Peoria for a little treat from a burger joint that we had previously just raved about (99th & McDowell).  

Right off the bat I KNEW that this was going to be a bust.  When we ordered we were told that there were no fries left.  UH?  REALLY?  This was at 5PM and there no french fries at a burger joint?  That's like going to a fish & chips place and being told there were no chips.  Who the heck does the ordering for this place?

Secondly, I was going to have a beer with my meal but guess what - NO BEER!  Again, I beg to ask, who the heck does the ordering for this place?  

And lastly, it seemed like it took FOREVER for our order to come.  I mean, if you are just cooking 4 hamburgers with no fries, how hard can that be?  I was expecting to be told that they were out of hamburgers or buns.  The long wait for our food to arrive seem odd, especially when there isn't any crowd to speak of in the store.

But the thing that really chapped my hide was when I went up the soda machine to refill my drink, I looked in the kitchen and saw that NOW there were orders of fries coming out to be served!  If I were working at that store and had customers that had been told there no french fries, I would have certainly offered some complimentary fries to those that wanted them, wouldn't you? 

As I said, I really have high praise for Smashburger, just not this newly opened store in Peoria.  It's a bit out of my way but I'll stick to the store in Avondale."}
{"text":"We decided to give Smashburger another try and as much as I would've liked to give them 2-3 stars I can't. The staff is wonderful but I can't say the same for the food. It's still extremely salty."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome food and a great manager! Carrie went above and beyond for us on her own accord. Wish we had found this place sooner. Best burgers we've had in Vegas. If you want to go next door to In and Out change your mind and come here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Staff is hit or miss at this location. My burger is always good so I'll keep coming back. Last night I ordered a side of fried pickles and they were not battered... like someone just put pickles straight into the fryer and then served them. I took my order to go and didn't realize until after I'd left."}
{"text":"I just left this location. My food was good and the service was friendly, but the restaurant was FILTHY. There was trash all over the floor and tons of fries every where. The tables were dirty as well. It's easy to fall behind when it's busy, but there was no line and the employees were just hanging out. One was even sitting in one of the dirty booths by the disgusting floors on his phone. I'm not sure how no one noticed that the restaurant desperately needed to be cleaned!"}
{"text":"Food good but front counter girl made it very obvious she had somewhere better to be tonight. No Hello, used employee jargon for menu items, very impatient with ordering. Brought the food out and sat it on the table and walked away. No Thank You, no Come Again...Really? Geez. I will spend my $32.00 somewhere that appreciates my money. Get another job if you hate the one you have."}
{"text":"Smash is supposed to mean that they will smash all records with their product?
Well, they do attempt to fancy up the burger, but it's just not that flavorful at all. 
The problem? 
As usual with most burgers in the world, nothing is done to the meat before it's cooked. No matter what they say about the quality or type of beef, it's just not going to get better unless the meat is given time to assume some flavors over the barby or have some marinated smash added to it. All the fancy names and garnish in the world won't improve a boring almost tasteless beef patty! 
The fries are skinny little things dolled up to look and taste really good, but they were just so boring. 
Hence that I won't be going back any time soon, and then only if there are no better options (yes, McDo and the rest of his poor cousins are even worse). 
And so, what can a discerning foodie say? 
Can't recommend Smash to anyone who actually knows a great burger!"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  I thought for the amount of food we got and the quality that it was overpriced.

Tried the veggie burger.  The flavor was fine but it was very thin and crumbly and made a terrible mess.

Did not like the smash fries at all.  Our family of 5 didn't even finish the one order.

The line was very long on a Sunday afternoon and the service was not great.

We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awful service. Got me on hold on the phone for 13 minutes. I got there with the phone still on hold and NOBODY apologized. The girl just said , '\"my bad.\"  Won't come back. 
Much rather use the Lake Pleasant location. The manager was standing right there and didn't say a word."}
{"text":"First time here  the cashier was cool. Had the spicy baja burger and added bacon to it tasted fantastico all the way to the last bite! My guy had the bacon cheeseburger and he said it was great. The fries were different but good. Looking forward to coming back again someday."}
{"text":"The service provided by Victor (cashier/server) was absolutely GREAT! You can tell that he was well trained and have good customer service by the way he greets customers. SmashBurger should definitely give him a raise for everything he does. I will always go back to this location because of him."}
{"text":"Sad to see all the folks that have had a bad experience here. I like smash burger because they are usually on top of things. Anywho I stopped her once to grab a bite and it seemed to be ok. It wasn't the best SB that I have been to but it did satisfy my hunger. Hopefully they can re-staff and start getting some better customer feedback."}
{"text":"Pre-shoot grubbing: I took my model/friend out for a quick bite to eat before our shoot. She had yet to visit this fine burger place so i decided to introduce her. I would like to say a big thank you to the gal up front, I believe it was Katie  for providing phenomenal service. She explained the contents of each burger and fry variation and helped my friend to make the right choice. The place was kept very clean and she made the rounds to insure everyone was having a good dining experience."}
{"text":"The first time I ever went to Smashburger was here... The girl working the cash register was extremely nice and helpful, but it took awhile to get our food (not that many people were there) and the food was mediocre. Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"I'm usually not the person to talk to about chain restaurants. I don't hate chains, but I usually am out trying to find the next great hole-in-the-wall. But when offered the chance to try something new for free, I couldn't say no (I'm stubborn, not stupid). 

Enter Smashburger. The logo looks like they bought their logo design from the same designer that made Gamestop's, but they definitely don't play any games with their burgers. Surprisingly, all of the ingredients on my Arizona burger looked and tasted absolutely fresh! By fresh, I even mean that the jalapeños looked sliced, in house, and were as green as you'd get them from the supermarket. Also, the patty looked (was not a perfect circle) and broke apart like real ground beef! Those kind of little touches makes me happy. With my AZ burger, I got the smash fries (fries tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic), and they hit the spot. They were full of flavor without being soggy or greasy.

I gotta hand it to Smashburger, it's not bad. I would definitely come here on lunch breaks occasionally if I didn't work in North Scottsdale; I think it would be a perfect place for that. But I am sure I'll be back to dine here at some point. I think Fred M nailed it when he said, \"This place is to burgers what Chipotle is to burritos...\" It's a chain restaurant that wants to provide the type of fast food that is more appreciated nowadays - fresh (but not frozen), fast (but not microwaved) and filling (but not because you super-sized it)."}
{"text":"I have always gotten top notch service at this place- it's very laid back, very friendly, and they do their utmost to make sure your order is right and delicious. One of my favorite burger places."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my family at Smashburgers. First time here and was very pleased. The food was great, the service was exceptional. The restaurant is very clean. I would definitely recommend and visit again!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that my family and I ate at a Smashburger. I was impressed at the different burger options including turkey, chicken and black bean. We all ordered burgers. I got turkey, the rest of the family got beef. Everything was absolutely delicious. It was the best turkey burger I have ever had. (I got the Arizona w/ no jalepenos.) In addition to this, the restaurant was clean and we received great service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The peeps there are great!!! The food is great!!! The feel of corp sucks which is why 4 not 5 stars. I filled out survey and that's why. Corps always outta touch...always! Same here. But, the peeps at this location feel like home, the food feels like home...not idea about the music playing which they asked in survey. Richard Dawson...I don't care what the survey says...Running Man...I'll take RD on any day. Local food taste, local peeps. They make this work. Corp stuff is easy to ignore. Hope they don't corrupt it."}
{"text":"The most disgusting chicken sandwich I have ever had - no lettuce or tomato. Over processed and over fried"}
{"text":"This is my third review 1st not good, 2nd improvement, 3rd worst that ever. To top off our visit I took the manager (so she said) to the table and showed her the filth on the table and the trash on the floor.  Her only reaction was a rolling of the eyes and a turn to walk away.  The front of any restraunt is a sample of the care and attention to the consumer.  My largest fear is if the front is this bad I shutter the think what the kitchen must look like.  This particular location in my humble opinion is not fit to serve the public without the fear of sickness due to poor hygiene, and a \"I really don't care attitude\" from the management.  I tried to enjoy smash burger but you have convinced me  to eat elsewhere.  Everyone should BEWARE, this is not the only fast food joint in town and some of them are actually clean and care about retaining customer."}
{"text":"I'm always down for burger and fries. I heard good things about Smashburger and I finally got a chance to give this place a try.

The burgers are made fresh to order. I order the Spicy Jalapeno Baja with guac, pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, onion with Smash sauce. Delicious!!! Also got a side of smash tots. Anytime you order anything \"smash,\" it will be tossed in rosemary, garlic & olive oil. Boyfriend ordered the Buffalo and Blue Cheese and he liked his also. 

Burgers are big enough to get you full but small enough you don't walk out feeling like a fata$$ afterwards. I think the size of these burgers are smaller than In n Out? Either way...not complaining. I like the smaller portion actually."}
{"text":"A GREAT BURGER PLACE! The cashier Danielle was has phenomenal customer service. I informed her that it was my first time and she just took me through the menu explaining which burger was the best, her personal favorites and how I can substitute items to make the burger for my personal taste. I order the sin city burger with a chipotle bun (recommended by Danielle) and it blew me away. The burger was juicy, bacon was crisp and the fries with rosemary and garlic was out of this world. Thank you Danielle for awesome service and great recommendations! The only thing that bothered me was a table that was dirty with a dirty rag on it but awesome service deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My son LOVES this place. Their rosemary garlic fries are really good."}
{"text":"1 of my top 3 Smashburger locations. Located on the blvd but away from the strip this is a great spot to get your grub. All the times that I have been here the line has never been outrageous and have always had a good experience with the staff. I would suggest this spot to folks who wanna grub for a good price whether they are coming or going from the strip."}
{"text":"Service was a 5 star  but the burgers are good too. I just find the pricing at all these burger joints a bit much. I don't have to go but that's why I haven't in over a year. In and Out Burger hands down still has the best burger quarter pound  for quarter pound and best price too. I give them my money a few times a month. So taste is good, service great especially Sheenen I hope I spelled her name right. She seemed lile she had the counter, serving and anything going on. Shes ontop of her game. I bet she's a mom, lol. Everthing being said go try it and you won't be disappointed. It just hits the wallet."}
{"text":"They're slipping. We got takeout last night and first they tried to give us our order (4 burgers, 3 fries) with only one burger and two fries. Then, they tried to give it us with 2 burgers and 3 fries. Then - seriously - they tried again to give it to us missing the two burgers. Jeez. It's not that complicated. 

Once we got home (a 3 minute drive) we realized all of the fries were super cold and stale. The burgers had apparently been SmashWrapped© - the 2 guys in the kitchen really need to take it just a bit easier when wrapping the burgers up so that they don't destroy them. And my swiss mushroom truffle burger was super light on the truffle mayo - couldn't even taste it. 

So - I guess next time we'll eat in. At least the food won't be cold and mishandled - and if it is, we'll have immediate recourse."}
{"text":"I came here from Illinois and was so excited that there were smashes here. So good. Gotta make sure you check your order before you leave but if there's even the teensiest bit wrong they'll fix it right away with no hassle at all!"}
{"text":"Alejandra was super helpful but kinda lost about how burgers are cooked. I don't blame her but I guess the policy at all smashburgers are to cook the meat medium well. As someone who eats a lot of meat and a lot of burgers I have never head of this policy except maybe at McDonald's or Burger King. I mean for a \"gourmet burger\" place this is in no way gourmet. They are pretty much emulating a fast food chain but charging 9-10$ for a burger. I mean what's the point of serving \"never frozen\" beef if it is just have to order it the shittiest way possible. 
When I asked Alejandra if she ever had eaten a burger that was never frozen or if it was cooked rare/medium rare she said no. But then again she looked 18yo and doesn't have the acquired taste of a well made burger. Any burger cooked to well done/medium well TASTES LIKE CARDBOARD all crumpled up with peanut foams all cooked in the center. The burger was rubbery and hard and had the consistency of plaster. 
THIS PLACE DOES NOT SERVE GOURMET BURGERS. They are just calling it that to spike up the price.
Also their SMASH Fries- not good at all. Super oily and the rosemary Italian season is BS. 

I dare you to go to their website and look up the burger if you do not believe me. It looks like an arby burger/Fast food chain burger"}
{"text":"Went here with my BF and friend last weekend. I love SmashBurger, but I don't think I could go back after this experience.

The line was atrocious and they had a single register open. We had to wait forever for our food and they got two of the three orders wrong. On mine, there was no fried egg. Okay, easy fix.

But the other one...my friend ordered Smash Tots and got Smash Fries. The staff dropped the basket so fast we had to flag somebody else down to tell them. She had my friend move her burger to a napkin, then took the basket of Smash Fries back to the kitchen. When the Smash Tots come out, we ask what happens to the wrong orders. The staff member baldly says \"Oh, they go out on the next order.\"

So, food has been left at a table. It's then taken back to the kitchen and re-used, colder than fresh made and with who knows what germs are on it after some other customer's sneeze or whatever was on their fingers after they stole a few fries. Can you say health hazard?

Never again, SmashBurger. That's disgusting."}
{"text":"This is the worst location you could go to. All their employees were arguing with each other and nobody knew what they were doing. They got our order wrong and when we told them what was wrong they said that they would eat it fixed. We sat for half an hour waiting and by that time I was so angry because we didn't have any more time to wait we left. And never got our order correct. This is not a review for all Smashburger a though. I love Smashburger just not this location"}
{"text":"Visited yesterday for lunch. My order was the only one being worked in the kitchen. They forgot to cook my fries until after my chicken sandwich was done & in the pass for service. I know this because the loud conversation between staff. So when I finally got my fries, halfway through eating sandwich, I was not offered an explanation nor apology. Just a \"here ya go\". 
Guess my business doesn't matter. So I'll take it to where it's appreciated."}
{"text":"They have a really good manager here. The store was having technical difficulties with their digital software, but that didn't slow down the manager, nor did he lose his cool. He made best of the situation, and thanked the customers for their patience, as he handled other stuff that looked like it needed to get done until the software was back up and running. His name was Vincent. Thank you Vincent!"}
{"text":"Burgers are a-ok.  They have several specialties to choose from our you can build your own.  BYO let's you choose from several bun types like egg or whole grain as well as proteins such as beef, chicken, or Veggie patties. Top your burger with as many of traditional toppings as you like including cheeses. 

I went with the Jalapeño baja today.  It was ok. I'm not usually a fan of avocado on my burgers and they sure piled it on. It was useful with the fresh sliced jalapeño stacked on top because those sure had a kick.

They serve shoestring french fries and plenty of them.  My basket had a heaping portion that was plenty for two people to share. I like that they have other sides to choose from like fried pickles, sweet potato fries, and Veggie bites which are fried green beans and carrots combo. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Smashburger, located at the front of Stonecrest right next to Miro (near Marble Slab and Dean & Deluca), is fine.  It was meh, but A-OK.  There was nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't great either.  

Going along with the recent boom in burger joints in the area, Smashburger is another burger/dog/chicken/fries/shakes place where everything is a la carte.  You grab a menu on the way in, wait in line to order, are given a number to stick on your table and then you head to find seating.  They will also hunt you down outside if the weather permits eating in the courtyard - nice, eh?  

On a Monday night visit around 6:00 pm, the place was hopping.  Not crazy, but at capacity when I arrived.  Loud, very very loud.  The floor-space with carpeting does not absorb enough sound to make up for the exposed ceiling.  With the milkshake machine going and the kids squealing, it is deafening in there.  Even as it started to empty out, the hum of the movements of the few left still made for a loud restaurant.  

The food:
Chili-cheese dog $5 -  It was fine.  Nothing special.  The hot dog is butterflied and served with mediocre chili and topped with shredded cheese.  Meh.  Totally not worth $5.
Sweet potato fries $3 - The fries were pretty good.  Slightly thicker than shoestring, with a soft interior and a crunchy exterior.  Lightly salted.  The portion size probably equated to just slightly smaller than a McD's large fry.
Fried pickles served w/ ranch $3.29 - Meh.  Definitely not the best I have had, not big on flavor, ranch was boring.  They were fried nicely and the batter didn't fall off of the pickle chips, so points for that.  

Employees were all very nice and helpful.  The space was kept clean, even as busy as it was.  The guy on the milkshake machine was tearing it up delivering the creamy goodness to a restaurant full of folks.

Dinner with a drink was just over $13.  Nothing was fabulous.  I didn't get sick, but I won't be rushing back to the Smashburger."}
{"text":"I have to say that I've been to plenty of Smashburgers so I knew what to expect when I visited this location. Sadly, my family and I were really disappointed. First, we went to get our drinks while they cooked our food and the drink station was filthy. Not just dirty but FILTHY. Trash, dried soda and, here is the kicked, HAIR!!!!!!!! It was disgusting. I told an employee they may want to clean up the station in a kind manner but he was more annoyed than anything.

Food was good but the chicken strips was a chicken breast cut into two pieces and deep fried, my daughter wouldn't touch it. Smash fries had NO seasoning on it and yes, we did ask if we got the right fries, they said yes. 

It was just a really bad experience and I hope if you read this Smashburger, you make sure to keep the drink station area clean and hair free."}
{"text":"I think it is kinda pricey for what you get.  The service is good.  Kids meals chicken strips appeared to be a breast they might use in a sandwich breaded, cooked and then sliced.  Comes with fries and a drink.  Like that they offer vegetarian black bean burgers though they don't taste that good and fall apart easily.  Nice that you can pick what type of bread and toppings you want as well as what size burger for a regular beef burger.  The onion straws are delicious!!  My favorite part of the meal.  Also, they have fresh brewed iced tea.  Always a hit for me!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SMASHBURGER! Too bad there is not one close to my work. I love the smashchicken. Its so delicious and its served on a wheat bun. This is one of my favorite burger places to go. You must try!!! The staff is always friendly also."}
{"text":"Great Burgers, get some goat cheese on it
No one listens to me about the goat cheese but its really good.
Chocolate oreo shake also deserves note also"}
{"text":"Worst place EVER....We went in there for take out and ordered 8 different meals.  When we got back to the house to eat.....they Incredibly managed to F-Up EVERY single burger that we ordered."}
{"text":"I didn't even get the chance to eat at this place and I am extremely disappointed. After coming back from seeing a show on the strip, gambling and having worked up an appetite, I stopped at the front desk to find out where at the Rio I could grab a bite to eat because I was starving. The front desk said the only restaurant open was Smashburger seeing that it was 1:45am and Smashburger was open till 4am. As I walked up to Smashburger to place an order I wanted to verify that they were in fact, still open (once again it was only 1:45am) and the employee said no, that they were closed. Having not eaten all day and not one restaurant or room service in the hotel was open and this is a hotel in Vegas where everything is supposed to be open 24hours! For a hotel that is off the strip, you should have restaurants that attract customers!"}
{"text":"I eat here from time to time. Close to work, its fast, and the price is average. 

The burgers are pretty good, don't really care for the chicken sandwiches.

Items I enjoyed:
Classic Smash - basic burger, well cooked and seasoned.
Bacon Cheeseburger - see above, also has bacon (that's never a negative)
Smashfries - great seasoning
Sweet Potato Fries - helps change things up

Items I would pass on next time:
Haystack Onions - Greasy, small portion, lacked flavor, just a mess.
Avocado Club Chicken - Just very average for the price
French Fries - Get the Smashfries 

Overall, nothing to spectacular about this place. Really nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"THE BEST!!!!!!!  I live in California and am seriously looking into expanding the franchise to the Bay Area!!!  My wife is vegetarian and we BOTH agree that Smash Burger...especially the one on W. lake Mead, is the BEST!!!!  The Black Bean, the American with Chipotle Sauce and Smashburger sauce ROCK!!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service and food at this location is excellent! My only complaint is that every time I go into the restaurant there is an overwhelming sewage smell. It smells like their grease traps are full of rotted food and grease. I wish management would do something about it because I will no longer eat inside the restaurant because the fetid smell is so bad. I get my food to go now, but, I have to breathe through my mouth while waiting for my order."}
{"text":"Furious... ordered my son a regular bacon cheesburger to go to find out I had a cold plain child's hamburger when we got home.  Called several times - no answer, left voice mail-  no returned call."}
{"text":"To all my CHAIN HATERS out there....DON'T READ MY REVIEW! OK....I'm one of those \"Chain\" haters so sue me. BUT! I've got to tell you that THIS chain is A-OK! Why? Because their burgers are DARN TOOTIN GREAT....that's why!

You know, upon thinking about it, you've got to believe that the reason a brand becomes a \"chain\" is because they have a pretty good product to being with, right? Think of The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, I'm a BIG FAN! Like I am with P.F. Changs, Five Guys Burgers. GREAT food and service (usually). So why not Smashburger? OK Smashburger, you WIN!

Had their \"Big\" Mushroom Truffle Burger on an Egg Bun. Added bacon and grilled onions. MAN was this ever a SLOPPY burger....just the way I like them! Very juicy and very \"BEEFY\" meaning, plenty of FAT and not lean. Hey if I wanted lean I'd eat Chicken Breast, right? No Sirloin Burgers here....must be Chuck or something like that. Nevertheless, it really was great!

Oh, their fries are parmesean herb shoestrings which were REALLY good! I love shoestrings because they remain crispy, and the flavor that Smashburger imparts on them are really great!

Overall a 4.37 STAR experience! I just wish that they'd offer a Double Burger for us true Meat-a-tarians!"}
{"text":"Great customer service...I was greatly impressed!  Food tasted good...overpriced as usual.  Its amazing that this place stays in business in light of the In \"N\" Out directly behind it.  A very stupid thing to do is set up a burger place right next to In \"N\" Out...they steal all your business and they are way cheaper!  Not a smart move at all, from a business standpoint."}
{"text":"I am reviewing not on the food itself, because it's good, but rather the employees... Was not pleased to see an employee from the front, go to the back, put gloves on, then lift up his hat and scratch his head WITH the gloves on, then put the hat back on and NOT change his gloves while he continued to help the other cooks.....this is not the first time I have seen this either at this location.....regretfully, I will not be returning again....this is just completely unacceptable to me in food service, and quite frankly......disgusting.....:-(("}
{"text":"After enjoying Fatburger for years we were extremely disappointed in Smashburger coming in with the mediocre, lack luster burger,  the snotty (\"I'm from San Diego\") staff , the pricing, and the poorly laid out menu board, which is why the line takes so long! I hope Fatburger comes back, and this place goes back to wherever it's from. 2nd trip we had the Arizona burger, fries, onion haystack and soft drink x2 and spent just under $30 bucks."}
{"text":"After an evening of drinking in excess, greasy food is always a priority! Luckily for us, this Smashburger is open late and within a brief walking distance from Omnia Night Club inside of The Caesars Palace Hotel & Casino. They are actually in the Forum Food Court - near the entrance to the Forum Shops, Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill, and the Colosseum.

This would be my first time dining at a Smashburger and I was really impressed. We were served quickly, our food was cooked to order and to perfection; pretty awesome for a fast food joint. I really liked the sweet potato fries option as well. There are plenty of clean tables in the food court during the late night hours - so take your pick. There are also other food options open close by too, so your friend can grab a pizza if they're not down for smashing some burgers.

This is a great place to post up and people watch with just enough drunk traffic coming through to keep it interesting.

Keep it classy Las Vegas! Not like you needed a reminder. :D"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great tasting burger, then you'll love this place. It's right next to the famous UNLV and that other burger place. You just gotta try it."}
{"text":"On a slow night, this place couldn't get a small order correct.  A simple order of a bacon cheese burger, fries, and a soft drink to go was too complicated.  When the order taker charged my card I was assured I was billed for just one burger when I received 2, I again questioned my bill and was given a credit for the 2nd burger.  After leaving the location, I found I had a dry burger, missing all ordered condiments, including the bacon and cheese. If they can't get the simplest of orders right when slow, how do they perform when busy?  Skip the aggravation and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Be careful when ordering to go from this location. We ordered 6 meals and there was something missing or wrong with every single one of them. They managed to the the bill correct though and charged us for everything. It is a shame Smash Burger is so good. I guess I will just stick to eating at the one by my house."}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers that often but I do get cravings time to time.  I'm pretty basic when I order so I tried the classic burger with extra pickles. :) The one thing that stood out to me was the bun.  I believe its an egg bun.  Very yummy.  I also ordered a side of the veggie frites.  They were a bit on the salty side for me but still tasty.  I would probably make a return trip if I get another burger craving."}
{"text":"I have to give these guys the highest marks. I have been eating a no sugar, no flour diet for a while now (eating like a caveman!), so I am used to getting the weird and annoyed looks when I ask what is in the food or salad dressing. But I have to say these guys at Smashburger must have a corporate culture that teaches... \"make the customer happy\" and do it in a \"happy way\". Everyone from top to bottom went out of there way to get my questions answered and give me sugestions on how to order to accommodate my eating style.  The food was good and fresh, and since they moved in right across the parking lot from my office, I will be eating there a lot. They gave me a hint that you might want to try, if you want to avoid the salad dressing ask for the Smash Sauce (olive oil they use for the fries) that has some herbs already in it, then use the fresh lemon slices and make your own dressing. Way to go Smashburger!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally go to a restaurant for hamburgers, but this place makes some very delicious ones. 

From reading my beverage cup, I learned that Smashburger actually smashes their Angus beef burgers onto the grill, hence their name. The burgers are soooo good. If you have ever had Fatburger, I think the quality is similar. If a Crabby Patty was manifested into a real life burger---it may possibly taste like a smashburger.

I had the American smashburger and my BF had the Sin City smashburger. His burger was quite tasty---the fried egg made a difference! I love that they serve their burgers in \"egg buns\" too.

The smashfries are the best fries I have ever had. They were crispy and flavorful. I have never had fries like these anywhere else! Yum.

PROS:
-Refillable drinks
-Coupons are available, if you know where to look
-Seat yourself
-Server brings the food to your table

I am definitely coming back here to try out their other menu items, like the smashchicken."}
{"text":"I am trying to eat healthier portions and the burgers here are ginormous (and equally delicious and fattening). 

I ordered the kids chicken fingers w/ BBQ sauce, fries, and a small drink for $4. It was perfect! Chicken was delicious and I liked the breading a lot; you get 2-3 strips, I believe. Drinks are refillable, so don't worry about the small kids cup.

Also, if you want to try something different, get the fried pickles. I hate pickles, but fried ones taste pretty good. The boyfriend had the Cobb salad with crispy chicken and liked it a lot. 

I like Smashburger. I have been to other locations in town also. The food is good, with options for those who want to eat healthier (salads, grilled chicken). I recommend getting smashed here!"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious eats!  Think a step above a Mccalisters with better food!

Don't fool yourself - this is a cheap burger joint.  So for everyone out there who is expecting a gourmet burger and giving this place 2 stars why don't you come on back down to earth.

The burgers were tasty and the fries were better.  They also have a vegetarian burger option.  The place was clean and the staff was friendly.

Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  The food was very good.  The hostess that took our order was great.  She was very friendly and recommended a burger that was terrific.  The guy that brought our meal was nice.  I'd recommend Smashburger."}
{"text":"New fan. 
Had a regular smash burger and regular fries. All really tasty and didn't need any extras."}
{"text":"Absolutely hate this Smash Burger.

Always feels dirty and the food always leaves me disappointed.

Last trip my fries were just stale and unappealing."}
{"text":"I got really great service here! I came here right after it opened a few weeks ago and everyone was so nice for being awake at 9 AM haha. I know I'm not that happy at that time. I got the smash fries which were so dang good! The Sin City burger was a little smaller than I was expecting but I was still full walking out! Their oreo shake was one of the best oreo shakes I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The food here wasn't great. I thought it was expensive for what it was. I will say that they have good Oreo milkshakes though. I ordered for pickup via yelp and that was very convenient.  I got the crispy chicken sandwich and fries and my husband had a burger. We both  didn't finish because we didn't love the food. I've had smash burger before and it was aight. I still would rather spend my money at In N Out."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the Colorado burger while it's still available!!!! SO GOOD!!!! I've been to 5 star restaurants and their burgers were no where near as flavored as this!!! 

Only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how long it took. I ordered my food to go and expected it to only take a few minutes. 10+ minutes later I finally got my burger, and that was the ONLY thing I ordered. No changes to it, no fries. Not sure if that is the norm for to-go orders but I've always thought those were supposed to be quick."}
{"text":"Been here regularly over the past year.  Very, very good, juicy burgers served up as you like them.  Just not four-star level to me.

Be prepared to wash your hands both before and after your meal here.  Even an unadorned burger is juicy and if you don't hold it over your tray you will need a dry cleaning trip for sure.  Delicious beef, tastes like a hamburger should.

They have a number of suggested burger toppings and combinations but don't feel pressed to pick any but what you like.  You can pick what you want and it will be cooked and prepared to your order.  Some toppings are beyond the regular, like spinach, so you have more choices than at other burger joints.

Fries (regular and sweet potato) are good, thin and you get a good portion.  

Mondays are free milkshake days, so you get a FREE milkshake when you order a meal.  A very good deal and the shakes are wonderful.  Iced tea in three varieties are available at the drink bar along with fountain sodas.

Order at the counter, get a number, proceed to the drink bar and then to a table to await service of your order.  Very efficient.  Outside seating is available in a small courtyard and the tables have napkins, ketchup and mustard.

Can be crowded at peak hours, so be prepared or come outside of peak.

I think the prices are a bit high, but for the options you have can accept the prices as they are."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first when I saw the Classic Smashburger in my plate because it did look small for 1/2 lb and not very appetizing but I was wrong. It tastes very good. I enjoyed it very much. The quality of Smash Burger is right there with In & Out down the street... BUT it's pricey. $5.99 for a burger with no fries which are by the way too greasy? That's too bad. I had the Chocolate milk shake and it was delicious. Saying all that I'll go back without hesitation."}
{"text":"Love this place but last two times we've tried to go they've been closed. Very disappointing to pull up only to find out they are randomly closed."}
{"text":"I was in AZ on vacation and had planned to eat at several nice restaurants, but as we drove by smash burger we had to give it a try. We liked it so much we ate it twice in one week. It was hot fresh and delish. It's a fast food place but the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The burger fries and malted were smashing. Steven the cashier made it a pleasurable experience and it was great to get smashed at Smashburger."}
{"text":"Another burger chain using verbiage such as:

\"At Smashburger, we believe in ingredient excellence. From our smashed-to-order burgers, to our tender chicken sandwiches, signature sides and handspun shakes, you can count on fresh and high-quality food.\"

Then, you find out, according to their own website, that the only all-natural thing they offer is beef. They then doctor that beef up with smash-seasoning, which includes: 
Disodium guanylate, Disodium Inosinate, Hydrolized Corn Prtotein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, and other ingredients. 

The buns also are also far from high quality. My experience also left a lot to be desired. For the price, you can get a bigger, better burger without crappy additives at a lot of other places, including Wendy's, but also local places like Hobo's and Blacow. The area by the restroom was so wet that myself and several other customers almost slipped and fell. One customer brought it to the manager's attention. The only thing he did was make excuses not to do anything about it. The one girl working wiped down a filthy counter with a rag, then used the same rag to wipe down the milkshake stirrer - the stem that mixes your milkshakes. The fries tasted like they were previously frozen and not fresh. 

Even with a coupon we paid $17 for two small burgers, fries, and fountain drinks. I'd rather go somewhere else and get a better burger for the same prices (Hobo's uses real buns from Breadsmith, for example)."}
{"text":"Great food - I had a BBQ burger and fries and a coke. The onion rings were thin cut, and the bun was sweet. Fries were perfectly done, and the coke was coke.

My brother had a chicken sandwich and so did my mother. My brother also had the chocolate shake. 

Great customer service: after you order you sit down and someone brings you the food. My brother mistakenly ordered a burger when he meant chicken, so the guy went back and got him a chicken. Another waiter type came up and refilled my drink for me. This is kind of unheard of for a burger place.

Still, I hesitate to go back. The bill was almost 30 dollars and while the customer service was great, and the food was good, it feels like a lot of money to spend on burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I love these burgers! They are always done right, and they have options for sizes.  The sides are great, and for dessert they have Haagen-Dazs shakes! Great service rounds out the total package!"}
{"text":"Smash Burger you must have a giganotor sized wang to put a location literally 30 feet away from In-n-Out. Which if you have read my previous reviews you would happen to know that I am a self proclaimed burger connoisseur and In-N-Out loyalist, but any way enough about In-N-Out and back to Smash's gigantic throbbing burger dong.  I mean this thing must be huge, brontosaurus like, mounted somewhere at the bottom of the restaurants foundation penetrating deep into the dry, rocky desert soil, sodomizing the earths crust. Where it rest in solitude a sleeping giant waiting for Odins raven to wake it on Ragnarok.

So with that being said out of respect for the sheer girth and size of Smash Burgers wiener I decided to give them a shot and see what all the hype was about.  I was under the impression it was going to be more a long the lines of a gourmet burger joint. Which already put it in a negative lite for me do to the fact that the words gourmet and burger should never be in conjunction with one another. Upon arrival my previous misconceptions went quickly out the window.  My wife ordered the Sin City Burger 1/3 lb patty, cheese, fried egg, hay stack onions and bacon, this beast was pretty damn good.  In lieu of recent events my wife described it as being perfect pregnant lady food.  I ordered the Spicy Baja Burger which was topped with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, guacamole and chipotle mayo. Don't get me wrong it was a decent burger, however there was no \"wow\" factor.  Lets just say I wouldn't order it again.  Good but not great.  Now lets get to the high lite of the meal...DEEP FRIED PICKLES. These things were off the chain.  The serving size was smaller than I would have like to see, however they were still amazing.  

So if you're looking for a better quality burger with more flavor options that your typical sh*tty McDonalds or Burger King, and don't mind paying for it, take a ride to Smash Burger you won't be disappointed. However, with it being in such close proximity to In-N-Out I'll take a double double."}
{"text":"We've been 3 times in the last 8 days! It's that good.

The first time we went was a Saturday around 4:00pm. The place was packed and we almost didn't get a seat before our food was ready. We were instantly hooked on their food. My husband orders their BBQ Burger and I love the Classic Smashburger. The produce used is high quality and actually ripe. No yellow tomatoes here! The pictures you see of the burgers are a very good representation, not just some prop. Their Smash Fries, regular fries and Veggie Frites are yummy. 

The cashiers have been a little off each time we've been there, but probably because they are crazy busy. The servers have been super great, always accommodating and friendly. They also keep the place very clean.

As I stated before, the place needs more seating! Last night, we invited about 25 friends with us. (Not kidding!) The place was crowded inside, so we were trying to figure out seating arrangements on the patio. The manager came out to check on us & seemed a little frustrated by our large group, rather than grateful for the business. 

My husband tried to order a frosty mug root beer float, but they had run out of their IBC Root Beer. They also told him they ran out of meat earlier in the week because they have been super busy. 

I think once they get all the small kinks worked out, it will be even better."}
{"text":"Happy about the new location!  The fries here are normally overcooked so I veer away from them, the onion rings are amazing!"}
{"text":"Very expensive!! Very small side portions!!  We ordered seet pot fries and hatstack onions.  They were burnt and didn't even fill half of the box.  The burger was cold.  It ttok 30 min from the time I walked in till when I got my food.  When I got home with the food I tried to call them. They don't answer the phone.  I tried the next day and still didn't answer.  I went to their web page to the complaint dept.  2 days later still no response.  POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"You know that feeling you get when you know your food may have been spat in? I don't know if they did, but I made sure to order a beer to wash my food down.  I definitely won't be returning.  After my last review, I tried to give this place another try.  I will no longer spend my money at smash burger, and if I do.  It most definitely won't be at this location."}
{"text":"I think they're food is OK for the money. Unfortunately, this establishment is not well run. The employees are always behind and can't ever seem to get it together. We went in tonight and probably had the worst experience we've ever had with this place. We got a to go order and our bag was soaked through with grease. When we got home it's soaked through our placemats on our table through to the table. My sandwich was inedible because the bun was so soggy with grease. We would really like to return to this place, but we probably won't because of this experience. This isn't the first time they have messed up our order, but it is the worst."}
{"text":"Being a 5-Guys regular, I ended up here on Thanksgiving as 5-Guys was closed. I could have avoided it and had better burgers at A&W or BurgerKing.

Ordered the \"Best Burger\" - BBQ Bacon n Cheddar and the Classic grilled chicken and didn't like them!

No free refills as well!"}
{"text":"Second time at this location and cold fries again. Over $45 for 2 adults & 2 kids and I didn't order a side. Burgers & chicken sandwich were okay but it's pricey. For the $ there are better choices with table service."}
{"text":"Awesome when you wait in line for 15 minutes to find they are out of Buns,ice cream, ranch dressing, fried pickles, onions, ketchup, mustard, and like 5 other things ... really??? What do you have ???  Went to Shake Shack instead and barely made it before they closed"}
{"text":"Worst Smashburger establishment of all time. The staff doesn't know how to take an order, they are rude, and the food is horrible. I said no guacamole on my burger and sent it back and instead of giving me a new bun they gave me the same bun with guacamole just wiped off. Horrible."}
{"text":"My daughter placed an order online and she got confirmation of her order, but when I went to pick it up for her, they had no record of the order on their end. They had no advice for me aside from a blank stare and the statement that they never received an email for an order."}
{"text":"If you are looking for thick burgers that can be cooked to medium temperature (which is usually what I want), this is NOT the place for that and you will be disappointed.

However, for a \"smash\" burger (a ball of ground beef that is smashed into the grill to form a thin patty), Smashburger does it very well. I came in on a Sunday afternoon, so the place was empty. It has a similar style to a Chipotle in both decoration and menu. The lady at the counter was super nice and cheery. 

Based on the reviews here, I ordered the Sin City Burger with Smash Fries and an Oreo Milkshake. It only took a few minutes to be served and I was quite happy with it all. The burger was good. Fried egg, bacon, onion petals, egg bun, and a tender beef patty with smash sauce. They all combined quite well and hit the spot. The fries were thin and crispy, and even without any sauce were quite tasty. The smash fries have a light coating of olive oil and garlic, so that was nice. I opted for the chipotle mayo sauce, and that was a great dip for the fries.

Finally, the oreo milkshake was great. I like that they serve it old school with the metal tin with a generous amount of extra milkshake in. Creamy, thick, and with small chunks of oreo blended in made for a sweet escape from the blazing heat outside.

Overall, I was quite happy with lunch here. Compared to similar burger joints like Five Guys, I would say Smashburger has the edge. For my taste, they have better fries (I find Five guys fries to be too greasy and soggy), more variety in burger offerings, plus great milk shakes compared to no milk shakes."}
{"text":"This location is new to our neighborhood. My husband & I hadn't been to any Smash Burger before so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant was nice & clean. You place your order & pay at the counter. We asked for printed menus but they hadn't got any yet so we stood at the counter reading the menu up on the wall behind the cashiers so they could look up our nostrils while we mulled over all they offered. They were patient & helpful just the same. There are plenty of options for your sandwich, ground beef, blackbean or chicken, several kinds of rolls, several types of cheeses & a nice variety of toppings including grilled or fresh onion, iceberg or spinach. 
Then it's off to find a table & draw your own soft drinks. I was happy to find the tea is fresh brewed.
 The meals are delivered as they are ready, I ordered first so my burger was delivered first. My husbands came soon afterwards. The fries & burgers were hot & the toppings fresh & generous. Even the jalapeños are fresh not pickled. 
So how did the burgers taste? Salty. The burgers had, we think, a seasoning mixture with plenty of salt on them. The fries were cut with the skins still on but we're a very thin shoestring cut. That's okay for some folks I suppose, but I do like fatter fries."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to smash burger in forever but I'm glad I came back, always good customer service and delicious food, I highly recommend it if you're craving burgers and fries lol"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this for a while, and finally got around to it the other day. Definitely a place I'll be back to.

I ordered the 1/2 pound BBQ bacon burger and Smashfries. The burger was flavored nicely, slightly greasy the way a good burger should be. The bacon, onion straws, BBQ sauce, and cheese topped off the burger nicely.

The Smashfries were a pleasant surprise. They're regular fries tossed with rosemary, garlic, and olive oil. Unlike a lot of special fries at places, the flavor was excellent and not overpowering, and they were only 30 cents more than the normal fries.

I didn't do a dessert this time, so I'll have to try one next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here!  Service was amazing for a fast food joint. The cashier was very nice, food came out very quick and after our food came, he asked us how it was! When we were leaving, the cashier came and took our trash out of my hands to throw it away. I did knock off one star because I thought it was pricey for fast food. Tasty food, great service makes me a fan. We will be back."}
{"text":"Um, yuck!!  The employees were very nice, and courteous.  I know there are certain things that can happen in establishments that are beyond the control.  However, I felt this location wasn't very clean at all.  There were several employees who would use the women's bathroom (private bathroom) and would stay in there for a long time.  I couldn't help but notice the people waiting to use the bathroom.  I am talking a good 10 minutes.  We went on a Saturday evening, and were bothered by not one, but three different children trying to collect money for their supposed school.  Didn't look legit, so we told them no.  This happened two more times, same story, different kids.  Sorry, I don't want to be bothered for donations while I eat.  The kids weren't even eating there, the parents or whoever just dropped them off to beg for money!! Oh wait, there is more!  The icing on the cake was when three women (one of them passed out on the table) were getting up to leave.  And the one woman left, and the other woman tried waking her friend.  The friend who was passed out, wakes up (sort of) and proceeds to puke all over the floor.  So disgusting!! And to top it off, these women, just got up and left, didn't notify an employee or anything!!  We left right after that and told a worker, who had already been informed but I am so thankful we were done eating at that point.  I will be avoiding this location and stick to the Maryland Pkwy location."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Always get the Sin City burger n deep fried pickles,,,everytime! I crave it!!!"}
{"text":"Boy, you really can taste the difference in the meat.  Other places talk about the quality of their beefs and how they have never been frozen.  However, this place I can taste the difference.  They claim that they use a ball of angus beef and then beat it into a patties.

I believe it. 

I ordered the regular truffle mushroom Swiss burger.  It was tasty.  The bun is a soft egg bread.  The beef tastes like small pieces of beef--not hamburger meats.

Thumb up!

The haystack onions was a disappointment.  I like my onion thick and juicy.  This one is cut to super thin and string like.  The coating is very like and spicy like, so the onion has flavors.  However, the onion is simply cut too thin. After deep frying there is a roasted taste to them--not good, a bitterness from over burn.  

The Texas petal sauce is just like a dressing with a hint of mustard taste--ok.

Therefore, all the stars are for the quality of the beef.  Everything else is average or below average."}
{"text":"good quality burger.....i prefer 5guys but prefer smash over in and out :) i will be back"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fast food and tend to have it only a few times per year. But, we heard that Smashburger has a variety of interesting fried foods and decided to try it out. 

We tried the fried pickles and sweet potato fries. The pickles had a nice spice and light breading, with thick pieces of pickles. This was welcomed, as it was less about fried greasiness and more about good flavors. The fries were thinly sliced and had a strong rosemary flavor, which was unique. In addition, the chocolate milkshake was very good and I recommend it for a sweet treat.

Smashburger may not be a longstanding fast food staple, but it certainly offers unique options that I have not seen at the traditional places. It is worth checking out if you are in the mood for a fresh take on fried fast foods."}
{"text":"It's sad because the quality used to be consistent but this Smash Burger is a hit or miss today. But the Smash fries are always too oily and the Spicy Buffalo fries will dry you out with too much salt. We have been here a lot and these facts are irrefutable.

Now when you get the good order which evens out to about 2 to 1 against you the Burgers are great and the kids chicken strips are delicious if you can get past the not evenly cut pieces making it seem like you have only a total of 2 pieces instead of 3.

Location is ok. Can be busy at times but good place to sit down. Staff is friendly generally but slow and lack the sense of urgency with slow strides.

All in all this Smash Burger gets the \"The Big O 4\" out of my Big 10 score."}
{"text":"This is a new smashburger location. The employees are polite and the service has been quick. This is the second time we have visited this location. 
The kids burgers were great for our son both times. The bacon and blue cheese is delicious as well. I can't help but laugh at reviews where people get \"plain burgers\", the menu is right in front of you and you know why you are getting. Like most places you can add and remove toppings. The fries are always good, they are thin so they cool fast."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were wanting a burger with garlic fries.  Many choices of burgers here.  I ordered the spinach,  cucumber and goat cheese burger.  I never tried goat cheese before.  This burger was absolutely delicious.  And the smash fries were awesome.  Now I know I like goat cheese.  Excellent and helpful staff.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time visiting this establishment, my son and I both agree that we will be returning! He ordered a \"build your own\" Big Burger and after his first bite he stopped and said, \"this is a really good burger, we should come here more often!\" I had the Avocado Club with grilled chicken, DELICIOUS!!! Hit all the right spots! The chicken is cooked fresh and juicy. The meat quality was very good and the portions were very well sized. We shared a large order of the regular fries, and I have to say that I love proper shoestring fries and seldom find them so kudos for that! I saw reviews complaining about pricing, and well, you get what you pay for and there is no exception here. $24 for two including drinks, large fries and extras on both sandwiches, I can't complain about that!!! It's definitely worth the trip and the cost! Oh, and let's not forget the customer service... The girl who took our order was very helpful and gladly gave the extra explanations and suggestions for our inquiries. They bring the food out to your table once you order, and the guy running the food and bussing the tables was also very friendly. Looking forward to our next visit! Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Meh, just another average burger joint. Didn't really care for the greasy buns."}
{"text":"Of all the upscale fast food joints I've tried recently, Smashburger is my favorite, but there are still many places on my to do list. Every time I've heard this place mentioned, it's compared to In n Out. While I do think that the food is better than In n Out, I still think that In n Out is a better value. All these new burger chains popping up are sort of in a different league than In n Out. In n Out is a real fast food restaurant (with a drive through, usually right off the freeway). All of these new places tend to reside in strip malls and are usually less convenient to get to. They have each other to compete with, and it's a tight race. In n Out is miles ahead of their true competitors in taste, quality, and service."}
{"text":"This place is too small! Always overcrowded. The layout of the restaurant is awkward. The doors allow to much air to get in and out and you are either too hot or cold. Makes it difficult to enjoy your meal. The food is ok. If you're in the mood for a burger and don't want fast food. - come here. Just try to do it outside of regular lunch/dinner hours."}
{"text":"We came in around 12 right before a crowd of people, ordered a to go order. The poor girl behind the counter had no help and was very busy taking orders, making milkshakes, delivering orders to tables, etc. All by herself. We waited for 20 minutes for our food, and she gave it to the wrong guest who walked out with it. Said guest came back and said her order was wrong and the cashier realized her mistake and just handed it to us....after it had left the restaurant with someone else. I'm not impressed at all. This was my first time here and I won't be back, it doesn't matter what the food tastes like. The service was just so poor and the restaurant was dirty because they were so understaffed. Absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food is ok,and the service was not very good. Also, the interior is kind of depressing. I don't mind going there if I can sit outside but with all the other delicious burger places near by, this is definitely not in my top 3."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. It was so good. The burger was better than In N Out... In N Out still has the best fries (animal style only) though."}
{"text":"I don't get the fervor over this place. Our neighbors seem to like it a great deal, and we've given it 3-4 shots, but I've been disappointed with the food every single time. It's not often I'm disappointed by burgers.

Price points are nice, I suppose, but I think you'd be better off driving to In'n'Out or paying more at Zinburger, which is only about a mile away."}
{"text":"Burgers are top notch!  And some great alternatives for those of us trying to cut back on our carb intake... You can order any Burger without the bun and they now offer crispy brussel sprouts. Delicious!!  Oh, they also have a few yummy looking salads as well. Kudos Smash Burger!"}
{"text":"Pricey.  Average non-chain burgers.  I'll take Five Guys, easily."}
{"text":"Smashburger came to Vegas out of nowhere. As much as I like their atmosphere & service line.. Their food just didn't impress me. A good burger consists of good juicy, flavorful meat. No matter what yummy toppings are on it. Mine didn't . Their prices make no sense either. Besides that, I honestly don't remember how my fries were. Afterwards, I had to try an infamous malt. The chocolate flavored one was okay. I'll give them another try for a different burger!"}
{"text":"First visit to the new location close to home,
Excellent service and great food.

Dine in food at fast food speed. 

I like it!!!"}
{"text":"Iv'e been meaning to leave a review on this crap of burger place, but seriously, how important is \"Assburger\". This year, since this is my last year in Vegas, I told myself i wanna try best burger spot out here. And so far, its not being going so well. Me and my lovely lady decided to try SmashAss on a Saturday, since we heard so many great things about them(Im not being sarcastic, for once). I walked in solo since I was just getting a take out order. The line was pretty steep and it took a good 10 mins before I could place my order. I decided to have the 1/2lb Sin City Burger(lettuce,pickles,grilled onions,bacon,swiss cheese and a fried egg) w/Smash Fries and my girl got the build your own burger(lettuce,tomatoes,pickles,mayo,mustard,swiss and avacado)w/fried pickles and a couple sides of ranch. Now just from the looks of it, you would think these burgers were great right??...WRONG!!! To spare you my complaining, the only thing I liked on my burger was the fried egg. The bacon was burnt and the burger really just tasted like onions and overcooked meat. Well, thats pretty much what I was eating(Duhh).The \"egg bun\" they have is pretty basic and so are there fries. My girl said her burger tasted like Sh*t(fyi:It didnt really taste like sh*t, I had a bite of it when she was done, pretty bad, but no sh*t taste :) Also, im not an expert on avacado, but is it suppose to be brown?? Well the stuff on her burger was. Lastly, the reason for the 1 star is the lack of quality in simple sh*t that should be good, such as ranch. This had to be the worst ranch ever. It tasted sweet like Kraft ranch you by from Wal-Mart. Cool people, Horrible Food.

PS:SOGGY ASS FRIED PICKLES, eat them if you love cholesterol!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Arizona and Mushroom burgers on whole wheat buns.  Awesome tasting and decent price.  The smash fries with olive oil, garlic and parsley were good also. 

We went on a Friday night around 6:30pm during the busy dinner time.  I couldn't help but notice that the wait staff seemed a little out of sorts.  I could see a bunch of orders crowded on what looked like a 3' x 3' counter.  

There was a man (manager?) standing there constantly looking down at something, looking up at this super hi-tech video screen, and re-arranging the food on the counter.  It seemed a little chaotic to reach for orders only to put them back again.  1st in 1st out?

Occasionally he would grab an order and hand it to someone and they would meander through the aisles looking a little confused while trying to spot the table numbers.  I watched for a while to see if one of the orders was ours.  I saw what looked like our order and it was just sitting there.  When the waitress (bless her heart) grabbed our order, she seemed to glance over our direction, only walk to the back of the restaurant and then come back to our table.

I realize that it's not McDonalds or In-and-Out burger, but it took like what seemed like 15-20 mins to get our food.  (2 burgers and a fry).  The wait staff was very friendly and  personable,  but it seemed really inefficient on how they organized and delivered the orders.

I would see a waiter walk by with just one or two items in his hands (a soda or shake) and then return with 2 more items.  I know in-and out calls out your name, but at least your food is somewhat together and on a tray(?)

I thought, eh, mebbe it was just a fluke that our order came out so slow, so I went to the counter to order some haystack onions rings and it took about 15mins for those to arrive at our table.  The whole meal took about an hour, which is no big deal if you're not in a hurry.  The vibe feels like semi-fast food (ie in-and-out) but then you end up sitting around like you're at Chili's or TGIFridays

The onion rings looked good on someone else's table, but ours seemed a little over cooked and at the bottom there were little shards (think shoestring potatoes in the aluminum can?) and not worth $2.29 in my opinion.  Give me those fat cut rings you get at some steak houses any day :)

If you don't mind paying $20 for 2 burgers, fries, rings and 60mins, then this is the place for you.
 
Just a suggestion if the manager is reading this.  Will try another location to see if this is the company protocol.

Perhaps they could use the old tried and true method of placing the duplicate receipt on the order with the table number?

I hope this place stays in business, the food is decent value and tastes great.

Might want to try a new algorithm for organizing and delivering the food(?)

just sayin"}
{"text":"The chicken burger with the guacamole on it... is a serious chicken sandwich! Butterfinger shake on the side or the weirdly delicious unsweetened iced teas haha one of the best burger spots for sure"}
{"text":"Very delicious burger. Price is right as well.  Got a burger, awesome smash fries and a peroni for under $20. The same items at Gordon ramsey burgr the day before cost me triple that. This had more flavor. Definitely giver a try"}

But the restaurant is disgustingly dirty! I don't they ever clean their floors, they never clean the tables, 4 out of 5 times we have to take dirty dishes to the counter. They never wipe down the tables either. 
Clean it!!!!!"}

{"text":"There is a growing number of never-frozen burger joints popping up in Calgary, and I couldn't be happier about it. The food was tremendous. The person taking my order asked if I had been there before and let me know what to expect.

{"text":"From 8/22/15 

I've been told that Smash Burger is one of the best in this area for fast food burgers, so I figured we would give it a try.

We both ordered the Bacon Cheese Burger and Smash fries. 

The burger- was epic, flavorful, and did not taste like a typical pre-made frozen patty, it was tender like a home-made burger.

The fries- had some awesome flavors going on, I think they might have had oregano and rosemary on them, delicious!

I'm a fan, and will be back to try some of their other burgers."}
{"text":"Decent burger joint. I love the variety and all the different sides you can get- fried pickle chips, fries, sweet potato fries, chili fries, etc! . I got the black bean burger which is an excellent vegetarian option. It was flavorful and fulfilling. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's good spot for a hunger satisfying burger if you're in the area. Yum Yum"}
{"text":"I went in here expecting to be really swallowed up by the burgers and fries, instead what I found was a pricey burger joint with a not so fulfilling burger or fries. I felt like I was at a steak and shake. It's not my cup of tea. The service was great though."}
{"text":"Hammertime at the smash burger, yum yum yummy!  

If I were to compare any other places to Smash Burger I'd say Five Guys and Fat Burger off the top of my head.  I feel like smash burger is equal to five guys and only slightly better in the aspect that their burger was not doused in grease and made my stomach hurt afterwards, but not quite as fantabolous as Fat Burger.  

I found myself hustling the casino (or so I like to think) and realized it was dinner time; so Smash burger here I came.  Let's have it known that I'm in the middle of the P90x workout and I shouldn't be eating this type of food in the first place (I know I know, I fail!) BUT, it was better than going and getting enchiladas or some other high carb food item.  I already knew I was going without the bun, but to my amazement there create your own burger had an option for no bun, glorious! Now I wouldn't feel stupid ordering a burger with no bun.  So I ordered it with some jalapenos and such and when it was time to pay, I said charge it to my room please (as I had done with the other places) sadly they were not there yet, she did say soon, but not yet.  So I paid, she said 10-15 minutes, it was done in about 6, I was worried because it was quick and I immediately thought greasy thin crappy burger awaits me, but when I opened the container I immediately started a dive bomb into the deliciousness of beef, cheese, jalapenos, avocado and tomato that was staring me in the face.  AND BAM! Just like that 4 minutes I was done- another please!  No No... I didn't but I wanted to. 

It was very good, quick, the staff was friendly and minus my ability to be able to charge it to my room, It was an awesome experience."}

{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time. I was on a burger kick when I first visited this place a few weeks ago. I went to like for burger places in two days trying to find a really good burger. On my way home from work I yelped and saw the great reviews so I decided to stop by. Ordered burgers for the whole family and they all loved them. No one person complained. I love how juicy the burgers are. The bums are fluffy and airy and def add to the experience. I also like all the burger combinations. My burger today was go in 60 seconds. I considered ordering another one :-) There are really no cons here.  So here are 5 stars."}
{"text":"As Austin Powers would say, \"Smashing baby, yeah!\"

I have tried every one of their burgers and my favorite is the Spicy Baja! 

With that said, for you noobs and/or connisseurs, your perfect starting burger and sidekick should be the All-American or Classic Burger and Smash Fries.

All their burgers are made from 100 percent angus beef and come in two sizes. Smash and Big Smash for a dollar more. They also have grilled and crispy chicken burgers for all you chicken fanatics.

The fries and the other sides alone can keep you coming back. Obviously, if you get a Big Smash, good luck in finishing your sides. What I usually do is one of 3 things. 1. Get a Smash size and side. 2. Just get the Big Smash cuz its much bigger so you dont really need a side. 3. For the few times that im really hungry and/or im with people, I get the the Big Smash and at least one side and sometimes two so we can share.

For a complete list of their menu and contact info, go to their website: www.smashburger.com

Service is decent and they try to get your order out in a timely manner. From all of the locations I have been in, their bathrooms are one person occupancy rooms. So sometimes you have to wait. 

Random story. I was wanting to go to Gamestop to look for a game and subconsciously, I pulled up into the parking lot of a Smashburger. I guess from the color scheme it can easily confuse you if you are not paying attention. Nevertheless, I went in and got my Spicy Baja. Of course I still went to Gamestop later on."}
{"text":"Happy friendly faces greeted us, very clean and nicely decorated modern  look with booths and tables for choice of seating. Nice menu selection for Burgers and salads! Prices are reasonable and food is fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"my girlfriend and I we're starving and knew that we could get some good fries and veggie burgers at smash Burger really fast, so we stopped in this one to our surprise everything was disgusting everything was completely disgusting the tables, outside tables the chairs even the table # sign they gave us had dried up ketchup stuck to it. we could barely finish our meal but were so hungry we forced ourselves to. Someone let a bunch of dirty kids run this place- GROSS!"}
{"text":"Pretty awful. I've been to three or four Smashburger restaurants and all were pretty good. Seem a bit pricey but that's how the fast casual burger joints seem to get down these days. 

I went on a Saturday to get some take out. Showed up right bout 5pm and it was empty. Girl behind the cash register was \"on break\".  Confusing.  Another girl stepped up a minute later to take my order. 

I waited about 15 mins for my order to come out, the entire time the kitchen staff was playing grabass and doing everything but cooking my order. Tots were crazy greasy. Burgers had way, way, way too much ketchup and mustard. Made the buns super soggy. 

I'll make my burgers at home for a fraction of the price. That place has absolutely no management. I'm not sure who is supervising the teenage clowns in there, but I am sure they should be fired."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner tonight. We both ordered burgers. My husband's burger was ordered with no onion no tomato. We got the burgers home and found that my husband's burger had both onion and tomato on it. We immediately returned to the restaurant to replace the burger. When my husband told the cashier about the mistake, the cashier said \"it's not like we did that to spite you sir.\"The manager came up and had the burger replaced. When we finally got to eat our burgers, they were delicious. Although mine was cold since it sat while we did the return of the other burger. I just hope if you go there you have better customer service than we did."}
{"text":"Love the sin city chicken and the veggie frites"}
{"text":"Nice place . I love getting my Burger here . The bread is different from other Burger shop. Service here is  friendly and so welcoming too.
I will coming back !!!"}
{"text":"Let me break this down:

In N Out cheeseburger, fries & drink=$5.15

For 2 people to eat at Smashburger, it was $24. Uh really? For a cheeseburger, fries and a shake $12??? Wth?  

The food was so salty I'm still drinking massive amounts of water to flush the salt out of my body. Pretty sure I went over the  american heart association 2 gram sodium diet for the next year. I will never stray from In & Out again."}
{"text":"I have been going to SmashBurger for a long time and finally tried the spinach and goat cheese salad.  It is marvellous! I usually have an avocado club burger,  and it's great too. This salad may be a new favorite,  however."}
{"text":"When Smashburger opened up in this location my first thought was, \"They must really have some b@lls to open up across the street from In-N-Out.\" My initial visit was pleasing. I think it's because I really did not finish the burger. I was all about the huge vanilla milkshake. Yum. The smashfries were not bad but the olive oil was a bit excessive, so much that it was dripping off the fries when I picked them up. Thank the stars for absorbent napkins.
The subsequent visit after that was a grilled cheese. Good, but come on, it's a grilled cheese ... And there was one more visit in between that where the dots began before they finally connected.
Now the important visit was my very last time. The reason I say last time is that we are probably never going to go to Smashburger again. The salt, oh my goodness, the salt. In the middle of noshing on my burger, I suddenly stopped and said, \"I can't eat this, it's so salty.\" Then I remembered the time before, I had felt so bad after eating. Bing! Light bulb goes off. I don't enjoy high blood pressure. Verdict: No Smashbuger ever again."}
{"text":"Burger is super greasy, flavored decently, prices are way too high for the burgers, friendly staff, creative menu."}
{"text":"I am a fan! I have been to a lot of burger places lately looking for a good burger -- this is the best one so far and I've tried some big names. My date got a burger and he really liked it, I had a bite and it was real, fresh, burger meat good just like he ordered. I ordered their veggie burger it's called Black Bean Burger and it was good! I find that if I can order a veggie burger, with the same fixings as regular burger and have it be almost like a burger, but healthier and I'm happy! So far, my best burger in Vegas/Hendo. Oh ya and onion rings = YES!"}
{"text":"I think I got tetanus from going in to this location. The ice machine had ice overflowing onto the floor as the greasy haired employees stepped over it, and the floors had trash all over. The guy that handed me my order was wiping his hands on the back of his pants.  Barf."}
{"text":"Reallyyyy greasy. I got a to go order and the whole bag and wrappers were covered in grease. I put the bag down on my table and when I picked it up there was a puddle of grease on my table. Ick.

Paid extra for avocado on my burger and got one slice... thanks? I could buy a whole avocado for the same price they charged for that tiny slice. 

Black bean burger was a pile of mush. Fell into pieces when I was eating it. Ended up ditching the bun and having to eat the burger like a salad. It just tasted like mushed up black beans anyways. 

The whole thing just looked like a smooshed greasy burger with wilted lettuce and ingredients thrown on top that you'd get from a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"First time in and it was ok.. service was friendly and fast, we ordered few things from mane and it was tasty but nothing special.. I'll hit them again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Smashburger and now see no real reason to go to another one. The burger patty did not taste of the best quality of beef and cooking it on a griddle made it taste greasier. The haystack onions were thin, crispy, greasy and had no real substance. The fried veggies are just baby carrots and green beans deep fried that glistened in oil and had no seasoning. The chocolate milkshake was good but not worth the ten minute wait in line."}
{"text":"Really, really good and fresh ingredients. Feels a lot less greasy than other burger places."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are good, but like another reviewer said, they make little mistakes which keep me from giving them more stars. Came for dinner and the person in our group that ordered first, got her food last. Another friend ordered two Sin City Burgers, but only received one. The Sin City Burger I ordered, didn't come with the haystack onions inside the burger. We were hanging out for a little bit, so my friend ordered some Smashfries to munch on while we talked. After about 15 minutes, they still didn't arrive. After letting them know about it, we waited another 7 or so minutes and still nothing. My friend just cancelled his order since we were about to leave. The employee named Kristeey(I think that's the spelling) was very nice and cheerful. I'm sure I'll be back since I like the food, but I'll just have to live with the little mistakes they seem to make."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a quick bite while at Tempe Marketplace. I chose Smashburger because I wanted something fast, and particularly, I wanted to eat a sandwich or something with bread. The restaurant was pretty empty, not surprising on a week day at around 1:45pm. I picked the original burger (without cheese) and ordered fries and a drink with that. For a good filling burger, I paid basically $10. Not a bad deal! I also got a $2 on my next chicken Smash Chicken Sandwich. This makes this meal worth $8? yes!! 
The order came out fast. The fries were a lot! I cannot believe I just said that. I couldn't finish the order of fries. I think their fries are interesting, cut so thin so they are always crispy. It's good to do something different! 
The burger was pretty good. I cannot say it was super special to me (could be cause I picked just the original burger which basically means a patty with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions and I also skipped the cheese). Overall, a very good meal for the price and speed of getting the order out. Would definitely try it again if I'm in the mood for a burger while at Tempe Marketplace. I gave them a 4 star rather than a 5 because I wasn't swept off my feet but nothing negative to say here."}
{"text":"Very good quality burger. Food is made fresh and the meat tastes very good; so does the chicken. Tried the classic smash and the classic chicken today. Both were cooked perfectly and the toppings all fresh. The smash sauce in the classic smash was also very good. The orders came out pretty quick although the restaurant was pretty packed. Excellent service and very good quality food. For the price, I'm definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"We got the BOGO coupon from the newspaper yesterday and thought we'd try them out for the first time.  Wow!  We both got the Cheddar Bacon Burger and it was simply delicious!  No kidding, it was THE best burger in a restaurant that I have ever had!  Yum, yum, yum!  The toasted bun just made the burger something extra special - my mom used to toast the buns when she made homemade hamburgers when I was a kid, so I found this added touch to just be delightful."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since posting this review. The changes have slowed down quite a bit so it's less confusing. I have to say that I've received very friendly service overall since those initial visits. Also, happy to report that the shake situation has vastly improved! 

The food is good, the staff is friendly, and the place is usually pretty clean (it IS a super busy location, high table turnover rate.) We visit a lot because my son loves them. 

-------------------------------------
(Previous Review)

I've been here about five or six times over the past two months. Every time is vastly different from the previous visit. The only consistent thing is the inconsistency.

There have been so many menu changes in just the time that I've been visiting it's too many to count. Every single time something is different,or missing, or changed. There have been so many changes that each time the ordering process is more confusing than the last. On previous visits, they've gone out of their way to explain that the small burgers have been greatly reduced in size to just a couple of ounces. Tonight it's completely off the menu and the only way you can get it is to order a kids meal.

The hamburgers have been consistently good. Very tasty and prepared well until tonight, that is. We've ordered a bacon on our burgers every time but tonight the bacon was barely cooked and extremely fatty. I had to send mine back because it was inedible. The fries were good tonight but on a previous visit, my son's smash fries were dripping/soaking in a pool of grease. 

The last three times as well as tonight, we have ordered a milkshake to split. Each time it was served differently, and the last two times they got the flavor wrong. Sometimes it comes in two small paper cups sometimes it comes in two large glasses, sometimes in two larger paper cups, there is absolutely no consistency on a split shake.

The burgers are so good, but I'm afraid after tonight's visit I just can't see the value in returning."}
{"text":"Been to SmashBurger several times its a solid 3 star for me. It's not bad, and its not great in my eyes. I usually get suckered to come here because of my kids. They do have incredible french fries, I'll give them that. I'm a little scavenger on my kids plates if they leave any in their basket. I had the chicken club which was decent, the chicken was pounded SUPER thin, but thats it."}
{"text":"Group order via on-line.  Delicious- no complaints from anyone.  I had the Arizona burger complete with jalapeños!  

If you are really hungry order a double!"}
{"text":"There are scads of his burger joints in the area but Smashburger was one of the first and has consistently served up fresh and delicious Angus burgers since its introduction several years back. Their simple menu also includes smashed chicken sandwiches and tasty salads. Everything is made to order and is delivered piping hot by eager servers after being paid for at the counter. Both customer service and management have always been attentive during my many visits.

Their addictive shoe string fries are available three ways: Regular, olive oil and sweet potato. Serving sizes are generous. Although delicious, one drawback to thin shoe string fries is that they don't hold heat very well so, if yours do not arrive piping hot, simply notify your server and they will gladly provide a replacement and an apology. They aim to please!

One warning about the burgers... they are incredibly juicy and messy (in a good way) so be prepared to use a lot of napkins that are provided along with condiments at your table. I've never had a bad one at this location. Pricewise they are on par with other comparable burger joints.

My favorite menu item isn't even a burger. Instead chicken, spinach & goat cheese sandwich.  The chicken, like the burgers, is smashed and the goat cheese is piled on. Yum!

Oh yeah, almost forgot, they also have hand spun Haagen-Dazs milkshakes on the menu! They are pricey but go on Milkshake Mondays and you get a free one with your meal. Use caution however as you will leave beyond completely stuffed. Otherwise, the usual beverages are are offered at the self-service station.

Seating is available inside and out. Be sure to get there early at peak times as the joint is always crowded. The fact that I have never had anything other than good experiences here over dozens of visits leads me to give it an easy 4 stars, but again, there are many excellent comparable alternatives nearby. I like most of them."}
{"text":"I stopped here this past weekend and I can tell you that I will definitely be back. They have a verity of burgers along with grilled or fried chicken options to choose from. If you don't like one of their 7 suggested burger options, you can alway build your own. Plus, if you're GF- have no fear! They even offer GF burger buns! Gluten fans rejoice! There's also a pretzel bun available that is a game changer to any sandwich. 

They have a variety of different sides including buffalo fries (yes please!) and fried pickles! There aren't many fast food places that serve fried pickles so this is a win for me! I got the pickles (duh) and split the original fries with my husband, which have garlic and rosemary on them. Very delicious.

I didn't order one, but they do have some pretty bomb milkshakes on the menu. Next time I'll have to try one! Almost everyone in the restaurant had on- fail on my part."}
{"text":"I'm not too crazy about the greasy and sodium laden burger.   I think I gained about 5 lbs of bloatedness after eating one of their classic cheeseburger with a side of fried pickles.  My hubby didn't care much for the Arizona smashburger.  My little cutie pie did not like the smashdog.  But, we did enjoy the onion haystack and shoestring fries.  Those two things are not worth going back for.  

I just don't get what all the buzz is about."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food and at big price. I loved hamburgers and fries but I don't visit often because of the expense. I have only visited once."}
{"text":"Chose this place over Subway and Chipotle next door cuz screw my health. Got the Arizona burger and I'll never forget it. That's cuz elephants never forget."}
{"text":"Good service, clean eating environment, delicious burgers. Garlic flavored fries are yummy."}
{"text":"We called a head to order to pick at noon at 12 30 they got done . We got 4 burgers and  three shakes . 2 of the burgers were burnt to the crisp so there hard to eat I had to give it one star because the milkshake was god"}
{"text":"First and last time I ever eat here. ... My burger was missing 4 ingredients & my shake was wrong.  17$ for a burger with a patty,  egg & guacamole. At least the fries were the correct flavor... shake was good even though it was missing my Oreos... S my C, Smashburger . ..... I can't even 0 Star. Yelp can S my C too."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but parking is hard to get.  The burgers have always been delicious and they take care of the outside tables (cleaning) better than other locations.  Try the wedge salad and fries.  Delicious."}
{"text":"I think of this place as a high end burger place.  The burgers are ALWAYS great and fresh tasting.  The fries with rosemary seasoning and the sweet potato fries are a great twist.  I know it is crazy, but I love the wedge salad too.  The only downside is the outdoor seating seems to get forgotten where cleaning is concerned and there always seems to be a homeless person asking for money in the parking lot and they walk up to us every time we sit outside.  Stay inside & everything should be fine.Ha."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food burgers this is my second favorite of all time ;) -- they got super good shakes, burgers, sauce, pickles, & smash fries. Conveniently located in Caesars Palace food court before/after a show you can swing over and grab this deliciousness. OMG so effing expensive!!! Two shakes and one bacon cheeseburger was about $35 .. yeah for real! So that'll be the end of that for sure."}
{"text":"A good mix between a fast-food joint and a sit-down. You order and pay for your food up front and it's brought to you by a server. Customer service was on point, and the food was pretty good.Their sweet potato fries are delish, and the presentation of their food on wire trays is unique. So if you're at the South Premium Outlets and are looking for a good burger joint but don't want fast-food make sure you check this place out!"}
{"text":"I was expecting more! Maybe it was just this location but the meat itself lacked any flavor. All the ingredients were fresh but not anything memorable that I would return for. I would have enjoyed an in n out drive through burger more!"}
{"text":"As a first time customer, I have no complaints when it comes to Customer service! 
The guy who took our order was nice and patient, the guy who brought our order was nice and accommodating. 

But as for the quality of food, I give it a solid 3-stars.

The bun tasted good, nice and soft, the avocado was fresh which is expected.
BUT...
As for the meat (the most important component of a burger), some parts tasted burnt and bitter! I could NOT taste the bacon whatsoever as much as I tasted the onions!

The fries were NOT tasty!!!! it left me wanting more... NOT because it was good, but because it lacked everything! 

Pricey for the amount of food we got..

One bacon cheeseburger meal, one kids hot dog meal, + Bottled Root Beer Soda, and 1 Beer =$25.00

Kind of an odd burger joint, sorta like 5 Guys in which you have to add your own toppings to create your own burger, which was very unclear because the menu states *Bacon cheeseburger, and he told us verbally we had to add our own lettuce, tomatoes, onions upon request... 

Overall, we won't revisit."}
{"text":"Tried Smashburger for the first time a few weeks ago. I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I ordered the Arizona burger (chipotle mayo, habenero cheese, jalapenos, guac, lettuce, tomato) and sweet potato fries. The burger was spicy which i loved. The burger patty had alot of flavor which was surprising because I always thought that smashing a burger makes the juices and flavor run out. This was not the case. The sweet potato fries were really good and I liked that they put rosemary and oil on those. The sweet potato fries were a great compliment to the spicy burger. The hubby had the mushroom swiss burger with smash fries. He enjoyed both as well. Decor was cool and the service was fine. The only complaint I have is the price. It was 21.00 for my husbands 1/2 pound burger, my 1/3 pound burger, and the two orders of fries. Its actually cheaper to go to Fuddruckers and we get more food from Fuddys as well. I will say though that Smash burger was mighty tasty so I would still go back."}
{"text":"Food was really good, staff was polite. 
Did notice that while eating all the staff was chit-chating in the back. There were tables that needed  to be cleaned, litter picked up off the floor, front door cleaned of hand prints. They need to pay attention to how the store looks."}
{"text":"The gentleman at the counter was super. The salad, Cobb, was excellent. It was better than any \"restaurant \" salad. Clean place to boot. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Burger was under cooked and the fries were not good at all.  Plus it was a bit pricey for the quality in food"}
{"text":"Let just say the Baja Cobb was great but the cashier was super rude and when she dropped off my food she just dropped it and left I had my number backwards on mistake but she was mad because she had to walk around for 5 sec. also she was rude to her workers if there is a dirty blond with blue eyes  5'6 145 pounds run out quick"}
{"text":"I would like to say that Smashburger is the most smashing burger I've ever had. However that's not the case. The decor is very minimalistic, that's okay it's a pretty casual burger joint and I was meeting a friend here for lunch so I'm not expecting much ambiance or else something has gone terribly wrong.

So you saunter up to that counter and you have a couple of choices for burgers. I chose the classic with veggie frites cause those sounded pretty cool. Well the burger's the most decent burger I've ever had. It was filling and unmemorable, well maybe I'm to blame for that maybe I shouldn't order a classic burger if I want my taste buds titillated. Veggie frites? I was expecting something like crispy vegetables and they kind of ended up being a fairly small portion of oily limpdick veggies, at least they're salted nicely.

Total bill for lunch? $9 I might as well go to a nicer restaurant and pony up the extra $1 for a much more awesome burger. However when I'm in the Stonecrest area this will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I'm a local and I've eaten here often during both lunch and dinner. Beef and turkey burgers cooked tasty and fast and it's really the shakes that rock my world."}
{"text":"I had a bbq bacon burger once - I hated it. It's way too much,,,, but I guess if you are into healthy menu, you wouldn't eat here. Buns are soaked with oil - you feel you are eating lard. It's something that you shouldn't eat everyday - not even once in a week...... if you don't wanna get FAT.

I liked fries OK. Unique stuff like fried pickles was OK. 

Only good thing about this place is the price. They sell beer cheap. I think I paid only a buck or two for PBR."}
{"text":"This restaurant caused my boyfriend and I to get into an argument over whether preferring your burger well-done was wrong. He claims preferences can't be wrong. I claim they can. Examples of wrong preferences include: Preferring Hitler to Kittens, preferring Miley Cyrus to The Beatles, and preferring a 1/2 pound ground beef patty to be dry and tasteless as opposed to juicy and delicious. It's just wrong.

If, however, you are one of those who \"prefer\" well done burgers, like really, really well done burgers, Smashburger is the place for you.  It also helps if you prefer long wait times and cold fries. I would consider these preferences to be \"wrong\" as well, but who am I to say? It appears Smashburger has found a niche of followers with preferences very different from my own.

I realize that this location has just recently opened, so I'm going to cut them some slack with regards to the \"5-7 minute wait time\" that turned into 25. The employees did seem like they were working hard. The food window was extremely backed up while we were waiting in line to order, which made me nervous that our burgers would spend 10 minutes under a heat lamp before we received them. However, the staff seemed to catch up before our order was ready. Which makes it even weirder that my burger still tasted like it sat under a heat lamp for 10 minutes.

I'm being generous with my star rating because it may have been an off night, and I've heard some good things, but I can't see myself gambling with giving it another shot. I walked in craving a good burger, I left $24 poorer (for 2 people) and craving a good burger. Wrong."}
{"text":"People had to clean there own table while employees stood around waiting for food to be expedited. Food was delivered sporadic and some food like ours was delivered to another table before it was given to us after it sat under the heater for a clocked 5 minutes. Wrong orders made. Woman delivered food and walked passed dirty tables to stand again at an empty expediting window. The drink fountain area is filthy along with the floors in the restaurant. We will not return here again nor will or would we recommend this location. Manager only came out once from the back to say hi to a friend. Ultimately the responsibility falls on the management. There were many patrons who were obviously from other countries along with locals who now have a poor opinion of Smashburger corporation #WeAreLocals"}
{"text":"Food is good. But they forgot my order and had to wait 40 minutes. They gave my order to the wrong person..."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Smashburger salads. I know I know.. This is a burger place, who orders a salad at a burger place? ME! I have a big thing on salads I can never find any good ones that I would come back for. Well today I found one! 

Baja Cobb Salad with chicken. Comes with greens, guacamole, jalapeños, tomato, sharp cheddar, bacon and chipotle dressing. Next time I'll get it with no bacon. This salad is extremely delicious. The flavors just mesh well together. The guacamole give it a really good flavor and the jalapeños give it a nice kick. The dressing doesn't over power the salads like most salads I've had. It's the right amount of portion and it's served in a really cool salad bowl! The chicken isn't dry, it's grilled perfectly. 

I have had the burgers here before as well. They are pretty good. Their sweet potato fires are really good. Only complaint I have is that the burgers do not come with a side you have to order it separately. Like c'mon it's a burger joint, it always has to come with fries! 

I will be coming back here after my gym sessions to get their salads though. Be back soon SmashBurger!"}
{"text":"My first visit here I got the spicy AZ burger (yummy, not too spicy for this AZ girl) with the smash fries (thin crispy fries with a garlic and rosemary spice - I think). As a thanks for trying the place for the first time, the guy at the counter gave me a free drink while I waited for my to-go order (nice of them). Food came out fairly quickly, perhaps 6 minutes or so. I really enjoyed my meal and will be going back again."}
{"text":"I haven't been in a few months and decided to give it a try tonight and I really wish I didn't. The triple double was tiny. Took me 4-5 bites to finish. I got wilted lettuce, burnt fries. I ended up throwing 1/2 of it away. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Quick! Quality! Cheap! 

We had never been to a Smashburger and decided to try it as takeout. The cashier was patient with us (it was our first time in) and friendly. 

I ordered a regular (5 oz) Arizona Smashburger and he got a crispy chicken sandwich with avocado and bacon. The Arizona Smashburger was pretty good, I wish it had more guac but for fast food and the cheap price, it's a good amount. Patty seemed small for 5 oz, but OK for the price. 

Sides: onion rings and fried pickles... both came with sauce and both were very good. 

Definitely would come back if in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. The burgers are great as well as the sweet potato fries and the shakes. It is not a place I can go often because of all the calories consumed in one visit but it's definitely a place I treat myself to every once in awhile."}
{"text":"The guy at the register was kind and steered me in the right direction. I'd totally come again. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"Very bad all the way around. First and only time I will ever go. A bunch of younger people that have no concept of customer service. After ordering our food from a snooty girl, we sat and waited for our food for 25 minutes. While waiting, the employee in the back cooking and the girl preparing the take out and eat in orders were cussing and angry at each other. I heard 4 f bombs and a few b words. Horrible atmosphere. Btw the food was mediocre at best. The food was very greasy and tasteless. Do not recommend going unless your a teenager. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I never have a bad experience when I go to Smashburger, I fervently wish they'd install a location up here in Prescott."}
{"text":"Normally I love Smashburger but this one is just meh. I ordered the Jalapeno Baja Burger with spicy buffalo fries, and my fiance ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar with smash fries. We came in around 9:30 with our 9 month old and chose to dine in. 

Positives: Our waitress/cashier was INCREDIBLE, she was so beyond sweet, polite kind, completely amazing. We came in on 2/21/2016 and I didnt get her name but seriously this girl was so nice. She earned them a star! 

The soda was good to but thats probably cause they don't make it.

Nobody batted an eye at me breastfeeding which is always a huge positive in my book.

Negatives: Kitchen Staff were insanely LOUD. Like to the point my fiance and I couldnt hold a decent conversation with out hearing what sounded like a group of cackling hyenas in the kitchen. 

My burger (Jalapeno Baja) comes with guac, I kid you not I got like Half a teaspoon of gauc on my burger. I would of rather paid $1.80 (Like I do at Chipotle) and ACTUALLY get guac. Seriously.

My fries were the Buffalo fries and I'm pretty damn sure they used an entire container of salt on them. I order these fries every single time I go to Smashburger, and never, I repeat NEVER had this issue. I coated them in ranch (Which if it wasnt for our wonderful waitress, the kitchen would of forgot to put on the tray) and still barely got them down. Not to mention every single one of my fries were like 1 1/2 inches long.. 

My fiance liked his burger, he gets the BBQ bacon Cheddar nearly every time we go. His fries were the smash fries and literally there was SO much oil on them that every time he took a bit they would spurt little spurts of oil into his mouth. I tried one and nearly gagged at the oil, there has never been THAT much on them before. At least they werent over salted.

Both burgers were luke warm despite coming out of the kitchen right away.

They get 2 stars, if it wasnt for our awesome waitress they'd only have one. The atmosphere is very dull, they need music or something... i dont know. We most likely will not being coming back to this location, which is sad because we live right down the road.

I will note we did not complain because A. We had my 9 month old and did not want it to be an issue, B. We have been to this location before and it was not any better even when we did complain, and C. It is very embarrassing for waitresses and ours was amazing"}
{"text":"The staff here are very nice.  The cashier took his time to answer all my questions since this was my first time here.  The food was hot fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"We love the burger here before we go see the movie. ...
We like the outside ambiance. Of course if the weather is good. ...
There palm trees and huge fire place at the court. ...
Especially today there a live band celebrating st. Patrick's day.  ...
The customer service and price are good as well.  ...
We always have a nice dinner here. ..."}
{"text":"Fast service even when it's packed. Always have great rewards on app. I loved the Cobb salad. Very big, I could only eat less than half lol nice staff. And don't forget to get a Hagen daas milkshake. They're so good."}
{"text":"I was doing an order for DoorDash and when I went to go pick up the order they girl working the register said she hadn't even checked the doordash app so the order isn't ready. I told her to place the order and that I'd be back. (I have another order to drop off.) I return to smash burger and she hands me my order. I looked in the bag to make sure everything was there. There were no fries at all and when I asked \"where are they?\" she said \"they got fries??\" I said \"yes\" and then she proceeded to tell me that they were out of fries. So confused on why she wouldn't tell me that I'm the first place. Literally hate this smash burger. Terrible customer service. They were rude and I'm an innocent door dasher."}
{"text":"Very good and fast. Fries are crispy and very tasty along with the burgers. Only thing unfortunate is their variety. Not very much to choose from so it gets old quick."}
{"text":"First time at Smashburger! Best burger Scott has ever had. GM was so nice - very friendly. Love the Smash Sauce w fries."}
{"text":"Stopped at Smashburgers after a movie. I ordered the Avocado Club fries and a malt. It my friend had the Colorado Burger onion rings and a soda. We both left full and very satisfied. The burgers were very good as were the fries and onion rings. . Pleasant and speedy service.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"All the staff is happy to help, especially Sunny. His enthusiasm &  genuine concern for our satisfaction is the reason why we come  back. Oh and the food is great!!
Windy City is so delicious!!!
Thank u!!"}
{"text":"Good food yes, fast food definitely not. Do not come here if you don't have at least 20 minutes to wait for food to go. I compare pretty much every visit to about the speed of a red robin sit-down restaurant. From my experiences here food is pretty much on par with other Smash Burgers in the area. Decent Burgers but nothing exceptional, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Smash burger is normally a great place to stop and get a delicious hamburger or salad in a pretty timely manner.  However, this time just really didn't hit our expectations. 
Coming in around 1:30 on a Tuesday, it wasn't super busy. The gentleman at the counter was awesome and friendly as usual. (I believe his name was Nick. We see him a lot when we come and he always is accommodating. Keep this guy!) 
We sat down and typically we get our food fairly fast. It  took about 15 minutes to receive our two sandwiches and lukewarm sweet potato fries. To make matters worse, they had messed up one of the burgers. I'm allergic to onions and always make sure the person taking our order is aware. And there was onions. 
We were able to get someone to fix it, but she was very short with us. I believe she was the manager? I didn't get her name. 
It took us about ten more minutes to flag someone down just to get a side of smash sauce and our second side of fries. 
Normally this place is fast, friendly, and fun to go to. Our experience was pretty shaky this time. From having to wait quite a bit for our food, to having to have one burger fixed, and then having to wait longer for the rest of our order, I'm just not too sure this location is keeping the supposed fast and fresh quality they claim to have."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times with the family. Burgers are descent and prices aren't bad. Hubby likes the shakes and I usually order the tea but the last couple of times I bring my own water as the beverage area is always dirty for some reason. This last visit the bin that held the lemons looks awful and the cut up lemons were brown. Maybe they should have a smaller bin that is not metal to hold the lemons so they don't look so bad. The sweet potato fries are good. We tend to visit during the week as it does get crowded on weekends. Parking is not a challenge during the week either as it is across the parking lot from Trader Joe's. This is one of our go to burger places but just for the burgers."}
{"text":"This place is truly subpar. I would honestly not come here again. For the price it is not worth what you get. I ordered the Colorado burger which was the limited time special with the seasoned buffalo fries. First of all, as previously stated, the burger patty was small and not flavorful (especially for the price!!!) jalepenos were one of the ingredients on the burger and there was more jalepenos on the burger than meat. I had to take half of them off to even taste anything besides jalapeños. Next the buffalo fries.... they were possibly the worst fries I've ever tasted in my life. I love franks sauce and usually like my fries with it but the powdered crap that they put on the fries is pure salt. So much salt that it left that tangy sour after taste. We sent the fries back and asked for the original ones which were no better than McDonald's. we also ordered 2 kids meals that my children did enjoy, the patty was the same size as the one that was on my adult meal. Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I tried the one by UNLV before and it left me wishing I had selected In and Out. I figured I would try another location and keep my fingers crossed.  So far the service is much better. They even cleared my tray when I was done eating. The employees seem to be happier here then on Maryland Parkway ( SHOCKER). 

The food was delicious.  The chicken was perfectly prepared. Not dry at all and evenly seasoned. I was kind of surprised by the difference in quality.  They were an easy 4 stars by the employees kindness gained them the extra point."}
{"text":"This place tastes like Steak & Shake. The only thing different that I can think of is the Haagen Dazs milk shakes, the presentation of the food, they also serve beer."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken strips! Great fries! Avocado chicken sandwich is wonderful!  Fantastic shakes!"}
{"text":"I like their Burgers, fries and shakes here because everything is fresh like it's homemade. They have hamburgers, turkey burgers and veggie burgers. Great place to eat and fast, friendly service"}
{"text":"Visited Smashburger today with a friend for lunch.

I had the Smash Classic Chicken sandwich on the multi-grain bun. It was really tasty and the \"smash sauce\" had a nice kick to it.  

My friend built his own Smash burger and said it was delicious!  


We ordered the Smash sweet potato fries and the Smash fries-both were really good and I like the rosemary and olive oil on the regular fries but I prefer my SPF to be a little more plain.  Just my preference.  

Still a good place if you want a yummy burger and fries and not go through the trouble of a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"I dine here frequently and have to say I always SMASH my food down. I am a huge fan of Smashburger. I don't eat burgers which is ok at this place because they have options from Chicken, Turkey to Vegetarian so there is someone for dietary needs. My favorite is the build your own. I get to pick the toppings that I love the most. Then the tasty appetizers. What I like most is they have a variety of different fast food options. The fried pickles are the best I have ever tasted. The small size shaped fries are seasoned to perfection.

This is a busy location in an outside strip mall. I have never had to wait long and have always received friendly service."}
{"text":"You have to try the Fried Pickles. OMG! So good!

So I am addicted! Yes, in love with the Yum! Yum! This place \"Rocks!\" I don't eat red meat so there is options for those who have a creative diet. Yep, you can even build your own sandwich. The SMASHChicken that is flavored very well served grilled or crispy. I prefer grilled then I load it with all the yummy toppings they have to offer. Fresh raw or grilled toppings. With your choice of cheese or sauce. You can also choose your bun. Different flavors or have it wrapped in lettuce.

Now back to the sides. Those Fried Pickles make me say \"hmmmm,hmmmm, good!\" I tried the Onion Strings for the 1st time today and they are mighty tasty. I was not a big fan of their regular small cut fries because I like flavor but the Rosemary Smash Fries are beyond good. Then they have Sweet Potato Fries that are also good.

The price point for the portions they offer are good. Enough to leave you full or walkout with a doggy bag. They serve desert. I have yet to attempt to eat any because I fill upon my food I haven't room after. lol!

Best customer service. I have never seen an employee look unhappy. Your always greeted with a smile and your always thanked when you leave. The restaurant is always clean with fast service. I admire the managers they are friendly and actually work. Yes, besides greeting they are working with the line cooks, using the register or delivering the goods. 

I am very impressed. SMASHBurger is beyond fast food. They are a resturant that offers a variety based on dietary needs that is served fast, but healthy."}
{"text":"My boss kept insisting I try this place out so I grabbed my dining buddy(my brother) and drove up just to eat there. (It was before they opened the one near UNLV.) Their burgers were pretty delicious. I'd definitely go here again...though the price could be a bit more reasonable."}
{"text":"Note to management, set your employees up for success. Service can ruin everything!!!"}
{"text":"My go to place for a great burger ! They do an excellent job with the food and service . Also easy to bring the kids. Can't recommend enough for burger lovers !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joints anywhere, they have a nice variety of pre-arranged toppings as well as a build-your-own option.  It would be five stars if they'd let you get a rare burger, but alas, like a lot of places, they only go from medium to well done (overcooked to charcoal in my tastes).  The bacon is thick and excellent, and the bread is top-notch.

The garlic fries are awesome--standard and sweet potato both."}
{"text":"Ill start this review by saying that this place was really hyped up by a few buddies of mine, so in all fairness I expected absolute perfection...

Ok now for the review. The location is pretty bold, I mean they actually setup right next door to In and Out. They decor upon entering is kinda trendy, really modern and easy going. My wife and I were greeted with a smile and helped out right away. She ordered the basic Smash Burger with Avocado and some sweet potato fries. The fries were cooked with garlic salt and rosemary of some sort. That made for an interesting blend of flavors in my mouth. I ordered the Sin City and Chili Fries. The fries alone are bearable but nothing worth stopping traffic over. The chili was really simple but the onions made it a solid dish. The real jalapenos is what saved this dish. Without them it would have been just another layer of chili sitting on top of some ok fries. The Burger was awesome at first, then the last half just tasted like soggy egg break covered in egg, beef and bacon. They did however include some really cool ketchup packets with the meal.

I hate to say this, but it really wasn't worth the hype. In fact I don't think ill be going back anytime soon. If i had to chose between them and the competition next door, it would be double double city all day long. I wont waste time comparing them to anyone else, but i will say that there are much better burger joints in Las Vegas then this,"}
{"text":"Who hasn't eaten at smash Burger yet? It's a fast food style burger chain but better than those frozen ingredient places we all love for the high cholesterol and potential case of diabetes. I would actually write this place 3.5 stars because they are a little better than average but nothing stands out to make them over the top. Order a burger how you want it with what you want to talk with or even a chicken or veggie burger. They've got a special little fry sauce for you to try. Location has some friendly customer service orientated employees. If you haven't tried it, give it a try you might just enjoy it."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go and was NOT happy to get home and find out I had sweet potato fries instead of the regular smash fries I ordered. I hate sweet potatoes! On top of that, the fry container was only half full. SERIOUSLY?!?! If they are going to charge $3.29 for an order of fries, it should be a full serving and I should be able to get what I actually ordered!"}
{"text":"For a place that attempts to be a high end burger place with brioche buns and Niman Marcus beef, Smashburger falls woefully short. 

Smashburger will not cook the burgers to order. Instead, they arrive medium well to well done. Also, the brioche bun was a little stale and also too large for the burger. 

Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"SmashBurger Rocks!  The best burger I've had in a long time.
Their sweet potato fries are to die for, they are addictive. They make a much better burger than Five Guys or In and Out.  Service is great too.  I just wish there was a SmashBurger closer to my home.  I would seriously consider eating there every day if they had one near me."}
{"text":"After waiting 15 minutes, lunch rush, order came out wrong.  Slapped a new bun on it and called good. Uhm Nope!   Fries had a ton of oil but NO seasoning. Yuk.   In the 40 minutes I sat here I watched 4 orders go back.   Seriously it was not that busy.  Last time I drive from east Mesa for this"}
{"text":"Stopped by last week with my girlfriend to try out a burger. I asked the cashier, Danny, for recommendations and he kindly helped me out! He knew everything on the menu and built a very personal awesome experience at this restaurant. I ended up getting the grilled avocado club. Yummy! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Longing for a juicy (greasy!) burger? Well here it is, in one of the Valley's four new Smashburger locations!

Juicy, juicy, juicy! Nice taste. Probably the closest to my favorite (\"Steak and Shake\" - none in the Valley or west of Texas) I have had. Opted for the  1/2 pound and it is too big. 

Big  question is - worth more than twice the price ($4.99 for 1/3 pound and $5.99 for  1/2 pound) as for \"In and Out\" double-double and unfortunately the answer is no, I don't think so. Much like Fudruckers, which I would rate ahead of Smashburger for taste, it will be a \"once in a while place\" for me.

The \"Haystack Onion Rings\" were to die for, but a VERY small order, that without a sandwich are priced at a very pricey $2.99 ($1.99 with a sandwich)! Excellent!

Very clean, lots of help and nicely done, but prices are a bit much for fast food Hamburger."}
{"text":"Was not a good experience. The haystack onions we burnt and she  (waitress) ask me, you don't like them that crisp? My wife's  order was hold the mustard. Guess what, she got the mustard. She (waitress) said that's the smash sauce. If it walks like a duck and taste like a duck it must be a duck. I showed the cashier a coupon for a 3.99 for the All American. Which is a discount of .40 cents which is almost insulting. She explained that the photo of the burger was not correct that it did not have lettuce or tomato but she would add it for free. Now that was nice but she charger me the regular price. I would not recommend this place to my friends. They gave me my .44 cents back."}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers, although the restaurant was a bit dirty for me.  We visited on a Sunday afternoon around 1500, on 9 April 2017, and the beverage area was filthy, and there was a lot of trash and food scraps on the dining floor.  They were doing a very brisk business, and clearing tables effectively, but did not seem to have the staff to clean.  

Like I said, the burgers, fries and the shake were really tasty, and we would ups consider dining here again."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if possible. Both times eating here the place was filthy (had to clear the table myself). The staff has a definite I don't want to be here AND I don't want you here attitude. And the food was so-so...warm, not hot, fries and very greasy burgers. I will NEVER go to this place (it doesn't qualify as a restaurant) again!"}
{"text":"Tried this location a second time. Was even worse than the first time. Food is overpriced and service not up to standards. Had a cheeseburger bun ice cold as well as cold fries. Basket set up under the heating lamp for several minutes while the 3 upfront employees screwed around doing nothing. Won't be back to many other better hamburger options at about half the cost.."}
{"text":"Solid lunch plan if you're in the area. I would highly suggest the smashed chicken and the black bean burger- love me some avocado! The flavors are definitely there, but I hate the large amount of grease with every bite. The buffalo dusted fries were really good and can definitely be shared between two people; just image Franks Red Hot Sauce, but without the dripping mess! The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was super clean. Give this place a go!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is not.  We at there last week and went to sit at a table to await our food.  The server brought out my burger and fries but brought me regular fries, instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered.  When I told her, she muttered \"Jesus Christ!\" and stomped back to the kitchen.

Wow!  Talk about rude and inappropriate!!!"}
{"text":"First off...the service is always great when I come here :-) I want that out there....really wonderful people working here! OK with that said....it's way too greasy :-( I like a good burger and fries but dang this stuff is greasy! I keep coming back because I want to like it yet I keep getting covered in grease when I eat it and never finishing the food. For people that are cool with greasy food I say enjoy but people that can't handle a lot of grease don't bother trying this place out."}
{"text":"It's a good burger not the best I had but its pretty good...but if you are in the Northwest part of town go try Create Burgers it's just a better burger. The employees are really nice though...I think the girl's name was Holly, she was awesome :-) Wonderful personality and customer service, she gets 5 stars :-)"}
{"text":"I'm a big Smashburger fan and I really liked the vibes of the place and the quality of our meals. My one complaint would be the accuracy of orders, my buddy ordered his meal with tater tots but was given fries instead so for that I had to take away one star but everything else was awesome."}
{"text":"Burger & Fries - Exactly what I needed!  Traffic sucked on I485, so I turned off and hit Smashburger to wait it out. Ordered the burger exactly how I wanted it, and got the fries with parmesan - they were great! Service was fast, counter help was nice - I'll go again!"}
{"text":"Corporate crap.  Cold anaseptic ambiance, overpriced burgers, Fries had so much extra oil I gave my car a lube job after dinner.  Place stinks!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Better service.   We asked the manager if he knew of a christmas tree lot close by.  He went in the back, google it and printed out the address for us.  Definitely above and beyond for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is not only inexpensive, but the burgers are amazing. AND THEY HAVE HAAGEN DAAZ MILKSHAKES!!! Sooo good.... I got a 1/3 lb cheesburger with a fried egg on it. It was cooked perfectly, not greasy at all. I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Closing at 9:30, we arrived at about 9:10 with plans to order to go. About 9:15, they locked the doors and let those outside know they were short-handed and could not take more orders (said their manager never showed up). Okay, I definitely get that. Well, we get to order about ten minutes later. I order the daily special, a burger with 2 patties and 3 slices of cheese, and she orders a gluten-free truffle mushroom burger. I tried to order a meal, but the fryer was apparently out of service. Ten minutes later, and a room full of uncomfortable customers, we receive our burgers and leave promptly. Arriving home, I open the bags to find hers has a regular bun, no mushroom or any toppings but one leaf and ketchup, and mine has patties that are more like sliders with burnt cheese. There are other burger options within the same shopping center, though lacking gluten-free options, so I can't recommend enough that you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The location is convenient to my office and easy to get in and out of parking.  If it were as easy to get in and out of the restaurant, I might have another star on my review.  As I was waiting for my to-go order (quoted 5 - 7 minutes, took 10 - 15) I saw numerous patrons attempt to leave the same way they came in, which is where the line was.  The traffic pattern inside is very poorly designed.  

I was greeted nicely by a cashier  that looks like she needs to remove her funky earring and get back into high school and get her diploma, but she was friendly and efficient, until she needed to count out the 46 cents in change.  Yes, some people still use cash.

I ordered a mushroom-swiss SmashBurger for me and a Classic for my father.  I added on the sweet-potato fries and a shake.  

Since the burgers took a while I had time to savor an outstanding milkshake.  Handmade & mixed, and it tastes of quality.  After I got back to my office, I tore into the burger, which was moist, jucy, and flavorful.  A really outstanding burger that befits the fast-casual restaurant.  Not as impressed with the sweet potato fries though - as my colleage Jason B. mentioned, it seems that they are trying to do too much with them.  

2 burgers, a shake and side of fries was almost $20.  Of course, you're paying for quality, but that is very pricy, and I'm not sure it fits the demographic of the area.  I'm certainly down to go for a special occasion, but I just don't see this as any more than an once-a-month place."}
{"text":"Went here on a quick trip to vegas. Prices are reasonable and a good value for the quality. Enjoyed the sin city burger, but, had to request the egg cooked over easy so it would run and make the burger super juicy. Also, tried the Baja burger, nice and spicy, almost too much with the raw jalapeños. The onion straws are good, but, if you're an onion ring fan, they don't really hit the spot. Regular fries were good. Smash fries kind greasy. Overall, would return."}
{"text":"Very fast, fresh and consistent. They always get our orders correct and we are a bit picky. Ie: no butter on the bread, no cheese, ranch on the side etc. They always get it just right.  Also, I have never been there when they haven't checked on us to make sure we are enjoying our meals. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of the Smash*burgers* for a while. The Arizona burger with jalapeños is one of a kind for quickie burger joints like this one. Add on a side of smash fries and I walk away a happy carnivore nearly every time.

The other night, I gave the Arizona Grilled Chicken a try. The meat was surprisingly good for grilled. Cooked through. What made it remarkable were the spicy toppings. I don't consider myself a \"heat wimp\" but the peppers had me chugging coke after each bite. It wasn't the most pleasant experience, but I was still satisfied with my choice. 

Aside: One of the cashiers was quite pleasant while the other guy, who took or order, acted like it was forced labor. Or, like he was too good for taking burger orders, literally taking a long swig of his beverage as we concluded our order. 

Smashburger is not the best of the best in terms of burger establishments, but for the speed and price, it does the trick."}
{"text":"Consistently good grub here, regardless of location. Always made to order and hasn't yet disappointed. Even their Haagen Daz shakes are good enough to give Shake Shack a run for its money, and at much lower prices."}
{"text":"Stopped by Smashburger for a quick lunch. First-time visit. Nice clean place and friendly efficient service. Had the classic smash, hay stack onions, and a soda. Really good handmade cheeseburger. The haystack onions were a surprise. Very light, finely cut and great flavor. Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Manager was super friendly and service was great. It was a quick fast meal and was happy I did not eat the whole meal by myself. Great job smash burger."}
{"text":"A solid four stars \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"  Indeed.  Went there for the first time a couple of weeks ago and have been thinking about it still.  Good stuff and cheap!  

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the cashier.  With our dumbfounded look on our faces staring at the menu (as if we didn't know what was on a burger joint's menu), the cashier said, \"Is this your first time here?\"  YES!!!  So we continued to stare at the menu for another 4-5 minutes.  It's amazing how stupid we get when we go to order a burger!

Anyway, burger joints in Vegas are getting a little outrageous, don't you think?  They're as played out as old underwear. I proclaim there's roughly 7 categories of burger joints: 
1. fast food burger joints (McDonald's, Burger King)
2. Asian burger joints (Bachi, Fuku)
3. burger joints on wheels (Slidin' Thru)
4. burger bar joints (Kilroy's, Grind)
5. tourist trap burger joints (Strip Burger, Holsteins)
6. gourmet burger joints (KGB, Bachi)
7. give me a damn burger without the preservatives joints (Elevation, Fuddruckers)

Well, Smashburger is in the #7 category.  It's a good all-around burger that is cooked to order.  It sort of reminds me of Elevation and Steak N Shake because the meat is similar to ground steak.  The standard bun is the the egg bun, wholesome and delicious.  Other bun varieties are available, though I have not tried them yet. Toppings are well proportioned and fresh.  I opted for grilled onions and ketchup.  Of course, there are tons of other toppings available for all of you who want a whole salad bar between your bun.  The cheese is well proportioned as well.  I chose American and would recommend it to others however, for the more adventurous there's swiss, bleu, cheddar, feta, goat, and pepperjack.  Who wants a goat on their burger, ewe!  \"May I get goat on my burger?\"  LOL, sorry.

Smashburger is clean inside and has a modern yet cozy decor.  Orders are taken at the register where you are given a number.  Then, the food is brought to your table.  If you're really hungry, don't get your panties in a bunch because the food is cooked to order and takes about 10 minutes.  Each table is stocked with napkins for the sloppy (like my hubby), Heinz ketchup, and mustard bottles (good for people like me who like to secretly douse ketchup all over my food).  Sodas are self-serve with Coke products.  And of course they offer milkshakes (didn't try, on a diet at a burger joint).  

Smashburger is a good, reasonably cheap, #7 burger joint."}
{"text":"You will definitely overpay for a mediocre burger. And will more than likely be made incorrectly. I used to love the burgers here, but not anymore. Prices rise while quality plummets. Milkshakes are fine, but I can make one at home and probably pay less. Ugh, I'm pretty annoyed with this place at this point."}
{"text":"Good food but overpriced in my opinion for the size of food you get. Still alot cheaper than sin city burgers when that place was around. Create your own burger is a fun way to get what you want minus the fact it costs $1 to add bacon. Sometimes the line to order is long and they usually only have 1 register open when I go."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see there was a drive thru, thought I could swing by on lunch and get a great burger. Well I  was wrong and here is why... I pull up to the drive thru and I'm asked to hold on a moment, that moment was more like 8 minutes. I order my food and pull up to the window to pay and then I wait another 10 minutes for my BBQ cheeseburger... I was so disappointed that I wasn't given ketchup for my fries or napkins, like seriously wth... I begin to eat my burger and it was dry as eff, so not worth the $11.54 I spent. I'll stick to the location by my house, they are so much better.  Good luck on your visit!"}
{"text":"I love my burger.  I got the habanero burger. It was juicy and delicious.  The staff is great except when they come visit your table, it can be quite uncomfortable as they get in real close and feel like they are intruding.  Love the food though and the service"}
{"text":"Well the burgers were just average to me...I was expecting more with the name 'smashburger'...also the fries that were suppose to be real good were blah"}
{"text":"Love ability to create my own smashburger, especially chicken sandwiches.  The fries are great too."}
{"text":"It's a fairly decent and substantial burger.  Nothing special though.  Wouldn't really go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place I was really impressed. Great burgers with real or processed cheese - you can choose! Also lots of free toppings like sauteed onions, mushrooms, pickles, and all the other burger stuff. Thin meat, \"smashed\" so it is flavorful and yummy.

Great sides too: Pickle chips, mushroom poutine, smash sweet potato fries (tossed in olive oil and garlic) and even salads. Cheap beer - $3.99 Stella in a chilled glass!

However after I went back 3-4 more times the last few have been bad. The fries have been sitting under a heat lamp far too long, the burgers have been really greasy, and the service not too spectacular. I took my younger brother here on a Wednesday night and it was an hour before closing and the server came and took our plates and my half full soda glass that I was still drinking, then vacuumed our table intruding into our conversations. 

So I'll probably still be back; but this is a US franchise that is just new to Calgary. Give it a year and it will be nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"It was my first time at SmashBurger today and I gotta say I enjoyed it. I got the creat your own, and my burger was really tasty. We also got sweet potato smash fries and fried pickles. The fried pickles weren't my favorite, but the fries were delicious. The salad for 6.99 with chicken was a great deal for how big it was. I also love that they have different flavors of unsweetened iced tea. 
I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Burger ok but not a 7 dollar burger.  Truffle mayo didn't work and I tasted it all night.  Burger was dry and over cooked.  Getting out of the parking lot is a challenge.  Sam P."}
{"text":"WOW!

Last night was my first experience at Smashburger, and DAMN was I impressed!

I love living so close to Eastern and the 215 because of all the food options you have between the freeway and St Rose or so. Driving up Eastern road we happen to see Smashburger and took note that we needed to try that soon. 

Last night the opportunity arose, so we headed on over to check it out. The place was vey new and very clean. We just decided to grab the classic Smashburger with a fried egg on top (for an extra $1.00 each burger) and share an order of Smash fries, just to try them out. The cashier was very friendly and helpful.

Well, we sat down to wait, both very hungry and ready to dig in. We have several friends who do nothing but sing the praises of this place so we had high hopes. Well, there was a little snafu, as someone with a similar name grabbed our order by mistake and took off out the door with it. Ohhhh noooooo! lol 

Well, after the staff figured out what happened, they apologized and offered us both either a free milkshake or soda. My friend declined but I took them up on that soda. I was already cool at this point since they displayed empathy with the situation(which wasn't really their fault), and made an extra attempt to make us happy. This was cool, a business that actually appreciates their guests and backs up words with actual actions.

Well, after waiting for our freshly made burgers, the manager came out and gave us each a voucher for a free burger on a future visit! Wow! Talk about fantastic customer service! We left the place beyond impressed before even tasting the burgers...


and DAMN! those burgers were SO EFFING GOOD! My God! They were so thick and juicy! My mouth is watering just thinking of it! The fries were outstanding as well!! We were both making unnatural noises while enjoying out burgers! After we both finished we actually contemplated going right back and getting another one! lol We never do that!

We didn't go right back hat night, but you can bet we will be back in a couple days and many more times after that! 

I cannot recommend Smashburger highly enough, not only for the great food, but for the top notch and attentive customer service!


5 stars ....can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my local store so I visit semi regularly, and I've always had a good experience. Jose, who took my order today, was really friendly, and the staff always is. Definitely recommend the brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"The food is good and the staff was friendly. I ordered the grilled chicken avocado club, to go. When I got it out to eat the sandwich was a mess. The veggies were hanging off one side, the chicken was hanging off the other side. Once I took it apart and rebuilt it, it was fine to eat."}
{"text":"The first time I had a Smashburger was in San Jose, California and loved the fresh taste and reasonable prices. I usually stay away from food courts, but the ones in Caesar's are actually nice and Smashburger didn't disappoint with their great burger and yummy fries! If you are looking for a quick bite that is reasonably priced and taste good, stop by there for lunch."}
{"text":"The staff is excellent,  attentive and sharp!

Black bean patty?  Yes please.  

Egg on a burger?  In my FACE!  

unf! 

Not as inexpensive as Jack in the Box across the street... but absolutely worth it if you can spare the coin."}
{"text":"This place is double than what you would pay and get at In N Out. It's not worth the price and you have to order everything separate so no meals. It was okay .. If I were cheaper I would go back every once in awhile but eh. Their fried pickles are extremely salty and the smash burger fries I could barely taste any garlic. My burger was fresh and the avocado was really good."}
{"text":"I went before dinner rush so I did not have to wait as other yelpers claimed. The staff was friendly and asked me several times how I was doing . I will be back . The food was good for a burger joint!"}
{"text":"First time here!!
While the burger and fries was pretty darn good, I had some issues with price (and the fact that my regular burger was spicy). 

On the menu under the create your own burger section it lists that cheese is an extra $0.70 if you order it on a chicken sandwich. I was charged the extra $0.70 even though I ordered a regular burger. 

On top of that I ordered avocado knowing that it would be an extra $1.29 and I got a measly chunk of avocado...

I don't hate the place and I will probably be back but next time I will be clarifying a few things before placing my order"}
{"text":"Love the fries, always clean and cool inside. Good food reasonable prices. Only wish it was open later!"}
{"text":"Hurray for Smash Fries!  The lovely mix of  herb and potato is scrumptious.  I'd go back for the fries alone!

Okay, admittedly the prices are higher than your regular burger joint but the burgers are so worth it.   I went hot and ordered the  Spicy Baja which was full of spice and had a wonderful avacado addition.  I would recommend people who have this burger add cheese, which I didn't.   And/or  bacon, which I also didn't.   

But the beef!   That beef was not greasy in the least nad tasted like good beef should.

We went for a later dinner and three wonderful things about Smash Burger were the fact we grabbed a menu as soon as we got into line, so we decided on what we wanted while we were waitng to get up to the counter.  

The second thing was the staff were freindly and efficient.   

The third thing is they use McKay Ice Cream in their shakes.  Yay! 

I'd like to try the fried pickles and  Veggie Frites!

The Large Smash Box carrying bag was actually pretty cool for me ... since I was carrying it, but Mr. Grumpy figures Smash Box could cut back on the size of the bag.

I say nay,  I like not having to juggle the multiple bags of  food on the way to the car in the rain..

Oh, parking for this Smash Burger on 32nd Ave can get a little silly.  The parking lot is shared by other business and can get crowded when Smash Box is busy, which it seems to be due to it's newness.

For us, though Smash Burger is a Smash Hit!"}
{"text":"Coming from southern California where we don't have Smash Burger to Arizona and having several people talk about how great it is really left me wanting to try it. After driving to Chipotle and finding it closed for New Years Day I made my way over to Smash Burger and got their Classic Smash Burger and smash fries. I knew, just from the pictures, I wasn't going to get full but I wasn't going to buy 2 burgers I didn't like. The veggies looked great, the patty was greasy and that to me was a big thumbs down. Separating the hot and cold sides of of a burger is great if you don't sell a greasy patty. I ate it anyways. I was underwhelmed with the meat. Everything else taste pretty good and carried the rest of the burger pretty well. The thin stringy smash fries, I'll never understand, just oily basically. I won't go so far as to say Smash Burger is bad, but I left hungry and went through several napkins. I was a little heart broken since I love burgers and this place was spoken so highly of. I probably won't be back ...... mainly because I probably won't be anywhere near one but I'd try something else if I do."}
{"text":"management contacted me regarding my review and offered to have me in for a complimentary meal. I have not accepted, but respect them for reaching out and taking action on the review."}
{"text":"I have always liked Smash Burger however I recently moved to the area and started going to this location and now LOVE it. Not only is the food phenomenal but the service is second to none. Jared the Manager and his team were extremely friendly from the moment I walked through the door, to helping me order by making recommendations, to bringing out my food and checking back with me to make sure the food was fresh and asking if I needed anything. I felt like I was dining at a more expensive restaurant based on the level of service that was provided. I will continue to dine in because of the great service by Jared and his team."}
{"text":"So I've been going to this smash burger since it opened a few years ago. I just want to say that it used to be amazing and fresh tasting! The last 3 times that I have gone in this past year have not been so good: burgers have been cold, ingredients didn't taste very fresh, like they had been sitting there for a while. The fries are always good but unfortunately the burgers have not been. It just sucks, I don't know what happened to this place but it used to be great. I'm don't giving it second chances..."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location. Everything was great. Clean Friendly staff. It's 12:15 on Thursday and it wasn't busy. Got right in without a long line. And my Arizona Chicken sandwich was delicious as usual!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really liked this place. We don't go out to eat burgers very much, so this was a nice treat. 

We both shared a 1/2 lb. las vegas smashburger and added guacamole and mushrooms to it.  It wasn't as big as we expected it to be, but it was so full of flavor! MMm and the garlic rosemary fries were a nice touch, especially since we're garlic fiends!

I probably would've given this place 4 stars, but when we were leaving we were confronted by a very angry worker. See, my bf's friend got an application from them so he could give it to his brother. She walked by and saw it on the table and said \"who's is this?'' and he said it was his. Then she said \" you don't want to work here,\" he asked why and she said \" you only get like 6 hours a week, you don't want to work here\" (I'm sure that was BS). Then he said it was for his bro and she said \"whoever it's for, they don't want to work here.\" Then she freakin' took the application, crumbled it into a ball and SHOVED it down the trash. It was like she punched her whole arm into the trash can for dramatic effect. That REALLY pissed me off. I could understand if she was nice about it, like she was telling him a secret of something, but she was completely rude and obnoxious about it. I'm glad he didn't get to give it to his brother anyway, cuz who wants to work with a biznatch like that?"}
{"text":"I love smash burger, and I love their fries.  Arizona burger is my jam.  My main gripe with smash burger is that they almost never have hooks for bathroom doors.  I have been by myself to several and  I don't want to hold my purse or put in on the nasty floor when I use the restroom.  Just put a hook!"}
{"text":"There are other restaurants in the Rio Suites Casino selling burgers (and fries) - of lesser quality for a higher price - which helps make this Smashburger a better choice for those looking for a a beef, chicken, turkey, or black bean burger.

Unique to Las Vegas is the Sun City Burger, so that it what I ordered my first visit. I'm glad I tried it but wasn't as impressed with it as the guy who recommended it. Nor was I impressed with the speed of preparation - or with a cook showing other  kitchen staff a knob that broke off the grill. 

My second visit was better - although there was still a delay for receiving sweet potato fries - partly because I ordered something else and also because I used offers on the first receipt to get almost 3 times the food as my first visit almost the same price. 

Having accompanied others to some of the other restaurants in the casino, I now think this is the best burger place to eat for both quality and cost IF you do so at least twice."}
{"text":"Smash Burger is in the same vein as Fat Burger and Create: a quality (but expensive for fast food) burger joint.  It probably deserves 3 1/2 stars--putting it ahead of Fat Burger and on par with Create.  

Which isn't to say that Smash Burger is only a simple burger place.  They have salads, chicken sandwiches and a decent variety of toppings (think full classic selection of toppings and choice of buns, but not a cornucopia of exotic toppings).  Generally, Smash Burger has adopted the classic, simple and clean style of a fast food burger joint and improved on the quality of the ingredients.    

Ground beef should not simply be a carrier for the flavor of toppings and Smash Burger gets this.  (Applause sign lights up).  The burger meat is tasty and fresh (not a frozen patty) and I assume that it is full fat because the meat itself is delicious and quite flavorful.  I ordered their signature Smash Burger (cheeseburger with tomato, onion, lettuce, pickles, \"smash sauce\" and ketchup).  That's a lot of sauce on one burger, but I could still taste the patty--rich and peppery, textured but not overcooked.  And Smash Burger does love pepper.  The patty had a distinct peppery taste and a similar seasoning showed up on the sweet potato fries.  So, if you order a burger, know that you will have to enjoy pepper.

They do have an inventive list of sides for a fast food place (fried asparagus or fried pickles anyone?).  We went with the sweet potato fries and Smash Burger did a good job.  The fries weren't as crispy as I would have liked, but the seasoning was peppery and delicious.  It more than made up for my floppy fries.  We topped this all off with a vanilla malt, which was excellent (but, honestly every malt is usually awesome).

All in all, it's a solid on-the-go burger joint.  It can't touch the best Vegas has to offer, but for the price it offers a great experience.  Next time, I think I'll try their Spicy Baja burger and see how the patty does with jalapenos on top."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner before going grocery shopping because I thought it would be better if the family ate before going into a store with a bunch of food around.  Vanessa was the cashier, didn't greet us, and rushed us to order. When asked what was on a new burger, she mumbled the toppings off to my Hubby but I'm not even quite sure what was said.  My daughter was the first to order and somehow her order was the one that didn't get put in, maybe Vanessa was too busy looking around or day dreaming. I didn't notice that my kid's food wasn't ordered until I was trying to put the receipt info into the app that I now had to download since they don't do phone numbers anymore.

She gave a short quiet sorry and did a giggle like I was suppose to overlook the fact that my kid wasn't going to get dinner because she is young and cute?  I told the supervisor or \"MoD\" (manager on duty) about it and also told him that she should not be a certified trainer and has no business training any person and he kinda blew it off and asked if there was ANYTHING ELSE he could do!  He didn't even do anything in the first place!
Seriously? This place is ran by a bunch of kids.  Even the cooks were jumping around in the back laughing having a good ole time...but at least they were getting the food out quickly and did it right."}
{"text":"The store itself is squeaky clean and the staff are super friendly and helpful to their menu. The burger was cooked really well was a little salty but other than that a decent burger. So why the one star? It's because it's the size of a McDonald's cheeseburger and because they added lettuce and some tiny tomatoes they charged $6 for this tiny little Burger. If I want something that small I'll go pay $0.99 for it if I want a burger for a meal, I guess I'll stick to Five Guys."}
{"text":"The girl at the register as well as the other guy were superb in customer service. 
She have me a glass to enjoy a drink while my shake was being made. 
Everything was a bit too salty for my taste but have to include that I didn't ask for no salt like I usually do at in and out. 
Oreo Shake was pretty good as they added
Oreos to make nice crunchy bits instead of it all being decimated. 
The spinach and goat cheese burger was interesting and the avocado club wasn't that special. However the major negative was that the beef patty was precooked like McDonald's. It looked like it too. I remember  the burgers taking a long time to make but my order came out pretty quick. This only means cooked to order days must be over. 
The meat came out dry and a bit unappetizing. Salt may have been used to hide that fact.  
Experience 3 stars 
Food 2 stars."}
{"text":"Sorry kids , I  have to give this one a just okay .  nothinbg terrible about the taste but nothing mind blowing as well.  And a word to the wise the smashburger Fries are dripped with a rosemary grease. Now rosemary grease I am sure has a place somewhere in fooddom...but I am thinking it's not on the plain fries. 
YThe burger was okay , tasted like the kind dear mother used to make , fried on a skillet. Hmmm  for 9 bucks ..not my thing. 

Oh and heads up ..one size on the togo cups....and it's not big."}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite burger place!! The staff is super friendly and accomodating. The facility was clean and modern. The burger was flavorful and juicy. I got the spicy baja and it did not dissappoint. The combination of jalepenos pepper Jack cheese, and chipotle bun really worked! The smash fries are unique and delicious! I hope they can keep up with the adjacent burger joint competition!"}
{"text":"Based on my Bay Area experience with the chain, I was excited to see this in the Caesars Palace's food court. Smash Fries is one of my favorite items on the menu- rosemary, olive oil and garlic drizzled over french fries. I would definitely suggest this place if you were in a hurry or just needed some extra carbohydrates."}
{"text":"Smashburger has just recently opened and is a quantum upgrade over the restaurant that used to occupy that space. I thought I would brave the Friday lunch crowd and try this newly opened restaurant today. I got there right before the line started forming 20 deep.

I had a regular smashburger on an egg bun (without cheese) and a drink for $6.65. My burger was adorned with mustard, sweet relish, grilled onions, tomatoes and regular red onions (I didn't ask for the red onion, but it was good). The food runner even commented on how good that burger looked. Well you know what, it was Awesome. They even have people circling aroung topping off your drinks. My only complaint is that they didn't serve the drinks in the \"to go\" cups. I promise to bring back my \"restaurant glass\" the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Smashburger makes their burgers like you would for your grill at home. You take a pile of beef and flavor it with your favorite spices. Then you roll the meat into a sphere like a meatball and then proceed to smash the meat with your hand into a flat pulp while transforming it into a burger ready for the grill.

The Samshburgers are extremely JUICY and flavorable and have friendly and helpful counter help. I usually get the make your own option where you can pick your bun. Sometimes I need a little heat and pick the chipolte bun other times I gravitate to the good ole egg bun. Then you choose your cheese and condiments (they also have sweet relish for the burger). You have a choice between regular smash fries or sweet potato fries. Depending on how hungry you are you can opt for the 1/3 pounder or 1/2 pound patty. They also have chicken as an option, which my wife really enjoys. Again you can choose the make your own chicken option as well.

They have ample indoor and outdoor seating. You can get out of here for less than 10 bucks. This place laps the Delux burger type places. And to top it off you don't have to tip for an overpriced burger combo."}
{"text":"I passed this place a few days ago and it looked like it was already open. I stopped in tonight for the first time and was told that they just opened yesterday. This is a nice location with a patio. I like what this plaza did with the traffic flow too.

This Smashburger did not disappoint because I got Smashed tonight. I had a regular smashburger with grilled onions, jalapenos, tomatoes, lettuce, sweet relish and mustard on an egg bun. The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked, what more could you want."}
{"text":"I don't always eat burger, but when I do I prefer SMASHBURGER.  There are a lot of good burger spots in town.  There are cheaper ones, high-end ones.  Smashburger falls in the middle, but is as good as  a high-end burger spot.  I got the Arizona burger.  Beef is high-quality, veggies are fresh, bread choices are good (you can get multi-grain bun).  I didn't get any sides.  I noticed on the menu that you can make your own burger by picking out the bread, the patty size, sauce, etc."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ, bacon and cheddar burger, fries and a salted caramel shake = $14
The bad - my fries were cold - sent them back - new fries came out - NOT a fan - I ate a few and left them.
The good - burger was tasty!!!
The Delish - the salted caramel shake - so delicious.
I will definitely go back again, next time will order the sweet potato fries. 

9/2
Came back here again - burger is a tad salty today.
Shake is delish as usual. ONLY coming back here for the shakes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since it's opened, and I think this restaurant is either hit or miss depending on what you order. It's kind of sad because I wanted to love Smashburger. It's conveniently located near my house, and the promise of the restaurant was great, but the execution didn't meet my expectations.

The first time I went there was a couple of months ago. I created my own 1/3 pound burger with bacon, pepper jack cheese, spicy chipotle bun, spicy chipotle sauce, and some jalapenos. It bought the heat! It was extremely spicy, but man, it was so delicious. It really hit the spot after seeing a movie across the street at village square. Their smashfries were delicious too; they were smothered in oil, rosemary, and garlic for a crisp and tasty bite. 

I came back a couple days ago, and I wanted to try something new, so I ordered  the barbecue ranch smashchicken, and I hated it. Why would I spend $6 on this burger, when I could have gotten either some spicy chicken sandwiches from mcdonalds, or one of arby's chicken sandwiches for far less money for the same ingredients and quality. It was so plain and mediocre. The lettuce and tomato did nothing for the sandwich, and the person that made it put so much sauce on it that it was over powering the rest of the flavors and dripping out of the bun. Needless to say, I wasn't pleased.

My advice for you, if you want to try smashburger, is to stick with a burger. The chicken is plain, and you can get the same thing from other fast food restaurants for cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Had to see and taste for myself, is this jut another burger or something to care about?
My verdict is 'just another burger'
Ordered the bacon cheese burger with fries, companion ordered classic burger.
I liked the meat which was good, but nothing special. To me, I have always been taught, coached and told 'do no smash your burger, it will dry it out'. I think this is the case here.
The cheese was good and the bacon too but the other toppings were very good. Very fresh onion, crisp pickles and fresh lettuce.
Fries were shoestring, which were what you would expect of a decent shoestring, done just right but a little salty.
Cash register person was a very poor front of the house personality and attitude to greet customers. 
While an ok burger I probably will not go out of my way to come back but my companion really liked his a lot more that I did, so he will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a build-your-own burger type of place, Smashburger is the place to go! If you're looking for a mildly adventurous kind of burgers that aren't too whacky or unheard of, Smashburger offers just enough variety! 

The first visit, my friend who frequents this place with her family, introduced me. She suggested the Baja Guac. burger, but to get a basis of the food, I ordered the reg. cheeseburger. We ordered a large sweet potato smash fries. Smash fries adds olive oil, rosemary, and garlic powder to the potatoes, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference. My friend promised that this time the \"smash\" was skimped bc she remembers the fries being more flavorful and worth the extra bucks for the upgrade. 

I enjoyed my food for the most part, but for my taste it was very salty and I couldn't really taste the meat. Still, it was good enough for me to want it again and go for a second visit with my husband this time. 

The second visit I got the Baja Guac. burger and my husband got the same, but with chicken. Both burgers were SO GOOD. I always love a cheese, jalapeño, and bbq combination in my burgers so I asked for bbq on the side. I was torn from my burger to another that had truffle mayo in it at first and to make both work, I asked for the truffle mayo on the side as well and dipped my fries in it like an aoli! Everything was pretty good, but I still prefer other burgers on top of what we had. We ordered a large Sweet potato Smash fries again remember that my friend said that the fries are usually more \"smashy\" with the upgrade, but they came out just as plain as the first time. So we were a little disappointed at that, but that isn't to say the fries weren't good. They're great, but just not worth the extra bucks for the upgrade if what you're getting isn't very different from the reg. 

Service wise, both times everyone was super nice and on top of things. They made our experience feel very friendly!  Facilities wise it could use more attention to cleanliness as tables and booths were super sticky. The atmosphere was really really humid too and for a place where there's hot grease in the kitchen, it's not a great combo. If they raised the AC or even had turned it on if it wasn't, I think it would have made a huge difference. 

We'd definitely come again for a Smash experience if we're craving it because they do have something unique going on against other burger places, but I hope their flavors will get a little more bolder and exciting."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the service tonight:)) The guy and girl working the in the front were super nice and helpful. I think the girl's name was Rhiana. The food was great.. not too salty like it sometimes is. I got the spinach, cucumber & goat cheese smash chicken on a whole grain bun and hubby got his usual Classic Smash with cheese. We spilt a small order of smash fries. I like the Rosemary, olive oil and slight garlic taste and they aren't too heavy. They're just enough for something nice to nibble on when eating a loaded burger/chicken burger. I didn't feel guilty eating mine because it's somewhat on the healthier side but it's filling and yummy. Especially after a hard work out!"}
{"text":"Great Service

Really enjoy smash burger.  It has an excellent price point and the food is consistent from restaurant to restaurant.  I like this location.  The employees are beyond friendly and super professional.  I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Good Food, Fast, Friendly Service

We usually come here (depending on our mood) before UNLV Basketball games.  The service is always super friendly and fast.  The food is always tasty and good.  When I feel like a burger before a game, we will come here for the options between red meat and chicken.  I really should do the survey on the receipt to compliment the staff because they are super friendly, but I'm glad to give them recognition here."}
{"text":"1/3 lb burger on multigrain with BBQ, lettuce, tomato, pickles...and what is that  vegetable fries sound a little out there but give me some of those too!

Explosion of tasty goodness upon arrival.  At this time the best fast food burger I have ever had and those vegetable fries that sounded so odd...GOOD!

Next time some sweet potato fries...maybe."}
{"text":"Poor customer service at this smash burger today.  My daughter always orders chicken strips with a bun.  Today, tattooed, dark haired female staff member tells us there is no way to add a bun.  I tell her we always order this and it is never a problem (I've never paid attention to whether or not we were charged for the bun, didn't matter).  She got rather unpleasant about the incident and proceeded to be rude when delivering our shake, and again rude when she delivered our food.  We were not rude or unpleasant to her at anytime during our visit, and even left a tip, so this was completely uncalled for."}
{"text":"Great place to have a true fresh hamburger! You can tell they make there patties by hand! Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible, I waited for my second visit to do the review. The crew here does not communicate at all. I made my order online, went in and paid, the lady told me it would be out shortly so I went to the side and waited patiently. I then got tired of waiting and asked a lady that was running out food if my order was ready and sue said she would check, but another girl over herd and said \"Your the online order, its been ready. Dude did you even talk to anyone?\" So she gave me my food and I left. The previous time, I got my food and asked for some extra sauce on the side, the lady told the kitchen, and walked away to drop some food off. The workers in the kitchen then put it in cups and put it on the counter. I watched multiple workers walk passed it with no one asking what or who it was for, I had assumed it might have been for someone else because the lady that asked for it was moving it around, out of the way. Both times i was standing near the counter so its not like i was hidden and they weren't able to ask me if i needed help. Just all around bad communication."}
{"text":"Love this place! I branched out and tried a grilled chicken specialty sandwich and I wasn't disappointed. The thin \"smashed\" chicken breast was well prepared and all the toppings were fresh. I do feel a little bitter that we have to pay more to eat chicken over beef and the burgers are bigger than the chicken but it's that way everywhere you go. 

The Smash fries or regular are delicious shoestring style and as for the shakes...sinfully good and you get a very generous portion. 

Great service every time I go."}
{"text":"I have fallen in deep love with this burger joint! By far the best burger I've had in Phoenix, Scottsdale and surrounding areas. The high quality beef is the key here. 

I want to go back to make sure they didn't just catch me on a very hungry-weak night. But I haven't had the pleasure yet. 

I enjoyed the avocado-bacon version with some Rosemary \"Smash\" fries. Loved both!


The service and friendliness was top-notch. Did I mention I want to go back?! 

Thanks, Smash!"}
{"text":"Burger, fries and a fountain drink 18.37!
I try to be objective as I can, but I was hoping that it would taste at least as good as in n out burgers.  I'm disappointed to say the least, but I was soooo hungry I figured a burger place would fit the bill. 
I'm still home hungry!"}
{"text":"I got done with class one day and I was starving, and to no one's surprise the first thing that came to mind is Smashburger.  Very close to UNLV, so it was within the proximity of accessing food before reaching maximum hunger.  The thought of biting into one of the great burgers they have was undeniable.

I ate the Sin City Smashburger and it was good.  I had the 1/3 pounder with fries and it filled me up very well, I can't imagine how filling it would be with the 1/2 pounder.

Now let me note that Smashburger may not appeal to anyone.  You have to be at the right mood and hunger to really enjoy this smashing, oil-drizzling, fatty patty monstrosity to its fullest potential.  To the average eater or person with medium hunger level, it can get nauseating very quickly.  It's greasy goodness can leave you feeling rounder by each bite, the fat patty becoming harder to swallow by every minute, and a guilt trip that can last for days. My only justification for eating was because I'm going to be in the hot sun and swimming for the next couple of hours.  And to be honest, I don't even know if that's enough to burn off all the calories I ate.

With each passing moment I noticed that the burger got saltier and saltier.  Maybe my hunger was dissipating and finally my body started listening to my taste buds.  I could not finish the fries without drowning it in ketchup to lessen the saltiness.

Still, it's an experience.  It's hard to find an unique burger joint with so much greasy and eggy goodness (many of their burgers have eggs in it).  I'd definitely bring my friends over for a big burger eat-out.  I can't imagine myself eating here everyday unless I want to look like a pudgy round asian guy rolling around sponsored by Pizza Hut.  But it's a great place to visit once in a while, probably on a special occasion.

A little greasy, oily and salty, but would it be crazy for me to say that's part of the charm? Because it definitely is."}
{"text":"First timer here.  I was in Columbus tonight at choice of going to Chipotle which was right next door to this place or Smashburger. I obviously chose the latter and I'm pretty glad that I did. Now trying to watch my red meat consumption I went in there fully expecting to cave in to my Cravings however they offered a turkey and chicken variety as well. I chose a straight up turkey burger and they had some sort of California variety with guac on it. Anyway they also had a choice of fries or tater tots and you always go tater tot.

It was post lunch so they got on my turkey burger rather quickly and my spicy jalapeno Baja came out in about 5 minutes which was just fine by me. What can I say? It was cooked fast the turkey was delicious I couldn't tell if it was a pre-formed patty, Frozen, or fresh and I don't think it was fresh but it was good nonetheless. It came with Chipotle mayo lettuce tomato onion guacamole jalapenos pepper jack cheese and I kind of wish there were a Smashburger up here in Cleveland I could go replicate this sandwich. The serving of tater tots was about double what I think a normal person should have. The only negative was I didn't know what to do with my tray when I was done there was no where to throw it out and after wandering around for a little bit someone finally said oh here I'll take that for you. That coupled with it's a little bit on the pricey side.  Will return."}
{"text":"I really like SmashBurger. For me it is a big step up from fast food! But it comes really fast!
I usually get the Sin City and make it a combo. That is a burger with a fried egg, some sexy sauces, etc. And for the combo ALWAYS the smash fries! 

Let's be honest, is this going to be the best burger you have?? HELL NO!
Will it be a great burger/fries/drink for around $10 - Yes it will be!!

And a great place to escape and sit down after running around the outlet mall right there.
Just a simple walk across the parking lot!"}
{"text":"I never really ventured into Smash Burger, even though I have seen them.
then...BAM! I live a 1/2 a block away!

I have been missing out!! Today I had a \"Sin-City\" burger (Fried Egg, Onion Strings, and other burgery goodness) - Then to live the decadent life I made it a COMBO! That is right! Don't hold back! This added smash fries- tossed in garlic oil and rosemary, and all the soda I could drink. - It was the best yet!

In past trips I have enjoyed Bacon Cheddar, and Mushroom Swiss. Both really good options. Especially, for a less than $10 combo meal. 

Don't get the wrong idea, this is NOT Gordon Ramsey's BurGR! Not that kind of burger, but rather a BIG step up from a fast food burger...BIG STEP!

So if you are in the mood for fresh, tasty and quick. Here you go!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was good, very good, but it was the service that I really appreciated! What a great group of young adults who work there! All of them were professional, efficient and pleasant, but I only took down the names of Tom and Ariel, who both went out of their way to accommodate me without my even having to ask You would have thought the crew were all joint owners! This is a restaurant that I will definitely return to with my family on a regular basis! So happy we discovered it!"}
{"text":"I never get chips, or fries. Usually just a drink. This place makes me get the amazing sweet potato fries with olive oil and rosemary..their burgers come second to lobby's, though, and the service at this location is shitty at best. If you want to try smashburger, try the tempe marketplace location or the one on rural. This one also has zero parking, for you car drivers."}
{"text":"This location needs to get its act together. The last 3 times I've ordered here, there have been mistakes made. Tonight I got home with my takeout order and discovered that there was no cheese on my cheeseburger. There were also huge chunks of ice in the milk shakes. Definitely a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"CLOSED!  WHAT A HORRIBLE SHOCK. The best thing about this place is they called me Miss.  I am so sick of young people calling me by my first name once they HAVE to have it to call out my order.  As an older woman i feel i have earned this right to be called Ma'am or Miss. Thank you. Now the food: the haystack onions are my fav sometimes too salty but good."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all.They got my wife's order wrong and also the people in front of us got the wrong food. For $19 we got one drink two regular size burgers and one order of fries. In and out or Freddy's is better than this and cheaper."}
{"text":"Good burger! Order the regular size patty, the small was too small. It was seasoned and cooked well. 

The smash fries were meh. On the skinny side, which is fine. But I didn't like all the rosemary and oil. My mistake for ordering the signature fries, but when in Rome..."}
{"text":"Horrible burger!!!!! I was so excited to eat here but the food is upsetting. I came here because it was close to my house. The menu and pics looked amazing so I decided to order the Classic Smash/order of fries. I ordered \"to go\" so I decided to have a beer while I waited. Ordered The Joseph James Heffe. (That was the best item I had from here) I waited for about 10 min for my order, which wasn't too bad.I was starving so I started eating my French Fries while driving home....ICE COLD!!! :/ didn't want to turn around and go back so I tossed em to the side. I grabbed my burger and took a bite...SUPER CRUNCHY!!!! Took another bite and again..crunchy! Super upsetting! Didn't bother going back to return food so I tossed it. I should have went to IN N OUT like I wanted to in the first place! Grrrr!! I'll NEVER eat at SMASHBURGER again :/"}
{"text":"After such a great experience sampling burgers and sides at a recent Yelp event, I couldn't wait to get back to Smashburger. Unfortunately, I live on the other end of the city so having the opportunity to stop there is not easy. Lucky for me, I was recently traveling East to see family for the holidays. On my way back to town, I met a few other family members at (my suggestion) Smashburger. We all ended up ordering the classic smash and an order of fries, with the exception of my son, he got the chicken fingers. I like how the classic smash comes in two sizes for those with bigger appetites. The burgers were excellent. Cooked to perfection with fresh toppings. My family was really impressed with the quality. However, the best part of the meal for me was easily the Buffalo fries. I was dreaming about them since the Yelp event. At first bite, I was not impressed but they quickly grew on me and I soon loved them. Now, I can't get enough. Although they were a bit spicy for my family members, they were the perfect amount of heat for me. My 2 year old even ate a few without complaint! Fyi, kids meals are really large (I would even say adult size) portions. Overall, the restaurant was full of happy customers. Looks like they are working out the inevitable kinks that come with opening a new place."}
{"text":"Today mybroomate and i stoped in. All i jave to say is, Smash burger rocks my world!!!!! Always build my own yummy burger with an egg on top and it's delicious. You must try! Mike, Jared, and Trenton gave us awesome service, we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy and excellent service! I ordered the black bean burger not realizing it had bacon on it and they swapped it out no problem. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'd like to apologize again to the cooks and everyone else that had to deal with my friend's insane order. One Triple double with an added crispy chicken patty, bacon, and mushrooms, a side salad, fries, one bunless burger with mustard, and my shake. Good lord somehow they got everything right! It was all sooooooooo good. At least my friend says it was good, he did NOT want to share. It looked delicious and that added patty was huge! So good though; I'd already devoured my shake by the time I got home. I couldn't put it down. Thank you so much for humoring my friend and I and for your great service and speed (I don't know how they did it, but they had everything all made and ready to go within 5-6 minutes, despite the order just coming through after I'd just walked in the door). Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru expecting it to be quicker, it seemed like it took longer and the customer service here is absolute garbage."}
{"text":"This will be our last time at this location. We ordered 2 burgers and they were both greasy and over seasoned. Their fries were salty as well. The burger patties was so greasy that the bottom buns was soggy!! I didn't finish my burger at all. Waste of my $25. And why is it so dark in there. Not coming to this location anymore."}
{"text":"You can't ask more from a look-up-at-the-menu burger Joint. The menu has varied offerings, plus great sides like fried sweet potato. You can just about pick your toppings and the best part is the burger itself. It is homemade style and is smashed on the grill and cooked when you order. The meat is tasty and fresh, the 1/2 pounder is a belly full. Nice old fashioned shakes and malts. At the end of the day this is not a gourmet burger, but very high on the fast food scale."}
{"text":"love the smash fries with extra smash (garlic and rosemary)!! Burgers are delish :)"}
{"text":"My first time trying Smash Burger. I don't think this was really the greatest first experience. 

A coworker and I ordered online to pick up our food at 12 on lunch to avoid a long line. I was told the time waiting in line here and waiting for food was way too long for fast food. That was confirmed while waiting on our \"to go\" food. I was observing the regular line. 

We ordered our food to be ready for pick up at 12. We got there about 12:02. We stood under the sign that said to go online order pick up. The girl working the food counter noticed us but seemed to purposely not turn around to ask if we needed help for a good 5 minutes. We had to ask another person waiting if we were in the right spot. 

Finally she turned around and asked if we had a 'to go' order. She said back my coworkers name, as if she already knew that's why we had been waiting. Mine was a separate order. His was not bagged to go, it was sitting under the warming light things in a tray to eat in the restaurant. The worker requested them to bag it to go, which took about another 5 minutes. 

The waiting was really awkward. They seemed to not have enough people working for a lunch time rush. The customers waiting in the regular line backed up to the door didn't seem to be moving. 

I thought it was rude that it seemed as though she purposely ignored us. We were in the right area too. She didn't even seem to be doing much but waiting? It was really odd. 

I give two stars because although my food was cold and I could tell it was made way prior to 12 when I requested, I can tell the food would have been good had it been warm or didn't taste as if it had been siting around for awhile. 

Maybe it was an off day but the experience wasn't a good first impression at all."}
{"text":"I really really want to love this place. There was once a time about 4 years ago that I did but for some reason I feel like the quality has been going down hill. I ordered from my phone to pick it up but there was delay in the ticket machine so when I got there they didn't even have the order ticket yet. The milkshake was great but the burger and fries were kind of soggy and put together sloppy. It was such a disappointment because smash burger used to be SO good. Maybe they'll make some changes and step up their game."}
{"text":"North Carolina's own burger chain. I rarely have a burger I don't like so this is difficult to say, but this place was overrated. Not bad, just overrated. These gourmet burgers were not worth the wait or the cost to be perfectly honest. And that's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! You can get a huge salad for 5 bucks. They have veggie style fries. The burgers are delish! I'm so glad they opened by UNLV. The staff is very friendly. The atmosphere is warm, cool and inviting. What a wonderful place. Only drawback is I wish they had a baby diaper changing table in the women's restroom."}
{"text":"So my Boyfriend and i got the BBQ Smashburger and the regular fries with a ROOTBEER, and it was delicious just he eats so much he needed another burger they were kind of small for a man that is 6feet, 3 inches. BUt hey this will be on my list to every vacation i take in Vegas."}
{"text":"We've been going to the smash burger for quite some time now when I meet my wife for lunch at work. The food is always prepared fresh and the people are friendly. They have both indoor and outdoor seating options. Burgers are nice and juicy, the toppings are very fresh. Milkshakes are handspun at the time you order them. 

For all of their sandwiches, you can either order one of their pre-designed burgers or chicken sandwiches, make custom tweaks to those, or completely build your own burger or chicken sandwich from the ground up with their nice selection of toppings and dressings. 

A personal favorite is the Smashburger with the chipotle mayo and the haystack onions on top. Usually my wife and I need to get our own burgers, and split an order of the smash fries. If we're feeling extra hungry we'll add on a milkshake as well. 

They bring the food out to your table once it has been prepared, and every now and then someone swings by to check on how you're doing, take away the plates, and fill your drink if needed. It's like a nice combination of fast food meets dine in restaurant."}
{"text":"You wanted healthy??? Ok it is a burger joint, but guess what?....They cater to you health nuts ...excuse me ..us health nuts too! 

In my family, we need options galore and thankfully Smashburger delivers just that! With Veggie Fries (real veggies, not breaded and buttered) and an amazing Quinoa and Black Bean Burger and gluten free buns.... your belly and mind will be satisfied and craving more. 

Feel like being bad or just don't care about those gluten free freaks, then go get yo burger on! Cheese, Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Sweet Potatoes fries, and an oreo shake...get it!"}
{"text":"Well what can say, Smashburger, you have been able to make a normal hamburger spectacular. I love the create your own option so I can decide what I want for day. My only complaint is that I always order Ranch to be put on burger and yet you fail every time to put it on. You have no issues with the Ketchup or Mustard but for some reason you chose to ignore the added request. Other than that I enjoy the food and will continue to come back and back again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of well-done, simple, no-frills burgers, and Smashburger is just that.  A co-worker and I just came back from a wonderful lunch and I'm completely satisfied.  I opted to build my own burger and went with a 1/2lb. burger on the chipotle bun with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and chipotle sauce.  I'm not a fan of a lot of spices on my fries so I went with the regular.  A cold cherry coke made my meal complete.  I was told it would be 5-7 minutes before my order was ready, and not more than five minutes later, it was brought out to our table.  Not only was the presentation really nice, but the burger was out of this world!  It was cooked just as I like it (well-done) and was really hot and juicy.  The fries were good on their own, but paired with the chipotle sauce, they were near perfect.  The awesome food coupled with the friendly, efficient service ranks Smashburger up in my top three favorite burgers in town.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The burgers  and fries  are excellent. They get your food to you quickly and the staff are friendly. Comfortable seating but a little loud."}
{"text":"Stop by this place earlier, cause i heard alot of good things about it. It was pretty good for the first time trying it. Customer service was good fries were amazing but the burger was perfect. I made my own burger with bacon amd wooooo!!! Lol will go back eventually"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Smashburger I promise myself that I will not go back and then either I get a coupon or my memory dims.  One of the problems is that they never have enough help.  This time when we got there the line to order was almost to the door and they had one person taking orders.  When we finally got our order the burgers were ok but the potatoes were cold.  Usually I would give them back but my husband and I were splitting the fried and he did not want to wait because then by the time the new fries come we are almost done with our burgers.  With so many food places in this area they really need to step it up."}
{"text":"Good food, the service is ok, sometimes I feel rushed out or like I'm bothering them though. I would never stay and eat there."}
{"text":"Cheap burgers... love it, the original is the best. Burger sizes are definitely decent  , but the salads here are a little small even with the added on grilled chicken. I was still hungry after I finished my salad and even considered getting a burger to take home to eat, but decided not to since I was going to bed soon. 
Shakes here are my favorite though, they are made with haegan daaz ice cream and they are the best, they even come with a little extra (whatever didn't make it to the glass) this reminds me of getting served a giant milk shake with the extra in diners back home in San Francisco when I was a little girl.
I would recommend strawberry. =)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Rebel Special. Pretty darn good! I don't like the fries much though. Too oily. Ew."}
{"text":"great food and customer service. however i did call in to make a pick up order and after coming in to pick up my food the employee though it was appropriate to use my number for personal use and call me asking for a date."}
{"text":"Had a good bacon cheese burger. I don't remember all of the grease everyone is talking about. I swapped regular cheese for pepper Jack. Fries were pretty good. They were original. Seasoned well and cooked nicely. 
 
My second visit was not as good.  The chili for this burger was not like any chili I have had on a burger. It came in a microscopic size dish. Looked like it was more of a spread than chilly. If you build your own, be sure to add lettuce or what not. I didn't even have mayo or anything. Food was fresh. Fresh lettuce etc.

Patio was nice and clean. So was the inside.  Everyone was really nice. I think this place could give a few other well known old time burger places a run for their money."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Hamburger was okay, but way overpriced.  Beef quality was not very good.  The Smash fries were under cooked but okay flavor.  But for 2.50 I would expect more than a half empty paper cup.  Would rather pay the extra 4 dollars and go to a restaurant for a way better burger and fries."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Smash location. Not up to their usual standard. Burger was bland, no flavor. Fries were soggy (probably left them hang over the fryer before cooking, that ruins them every time). Service sux. I won't be back to this Smash. Need to have their franchise pulled or some more training."}
{"text":"I walked in and it was the first time I had ever been to a Smashburger.  The place was not too brightly lit (5 guys get a clue), had nice seats, it was clean and had a very good first impression.   I had followed a young couple in and it was obvuious they were on a date so it was good enough for them to pick as a destination. Menu greeted me at he doorway so you could a have a look at it, proceeded forward to order and the wait staff was polite and nice.  Definitely upscale from the competitors.

Food arrived quickly.  I had read Yelp reviews, so was prepared and had the 1/3rd Smashburger, sweet potato smashfries and soda totalling just under $10.

Music was a little too loud in the dining room, the burger was tasty, but as soon as I raised it there was a puddle or juices that dropped out.  It was fresh and I liked the generous veggies on it.  The sweet potatoe fries were mystifying; didn't know whether to put ketchup on them or not.  They also had an Italian herbal flavor (oregano, basil ?) and while tasty are not something I'd normally order.

Summary:  Very nice place, good food, good ambience and just a tad out of the ordinary to be striking."}
{"text":"Not bad... Just stay with the normal burgers, you will be happy. Fries always fresh.
Can be a little salty for some reason."}
{"text":"Lemme lay a trufe on all y'all......

The \"Arizona Smashchicken\" (grilled version) is one of the best fast food chicken sandwiches you can find.

Anywhere.

Pair it with their tasty onion strings and a brewski, and you have yourself one DANDY tasting little dinner.

I've eaten a LOT of grilled chicken sammiches, and this one can stand with just about any of them.

Definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Place is Bomb

Great shakes, and black bean burgers are amazing. 

Bbq sauce and chipotle sauce is bomb on side. Pickles too. 

Solid drink selections as well."}
{"text":"Had to wait in line for over 20 mins just to order. The guy at the counter had to go back and forth to deliver food as well as work the counter. Normally I love Smashburger but this is definitely my worst experience ever. May never come back to this one."}
{"text":"Orders always wrong, always wrong. Did I mention they forgot about any hustle. And why does it take so long? I'm ordering a burger not a three course meal"}
{"text":"Smashburger was an awesome experience. I got in the mood for a great burger, that threw fast food out the window. I didn't want to pay out the nose for one either. The price was right at smashburger, as was the quality of burger I was looking for. The smash fries were awesome, never tried fries with rosemary and tyme before."}
{"text":"It gets two stars because my kids loved their meals (one plain burger and smash fries, one crispy chicken strip kids meal). As for me, it was the worst burger I've ever had. I ordered the bacon, avocado club with a big patty. What I got was an over cooked patty that was falling apart, one strip of bacon, three slices of avocado and two of tomato. What a rip off."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and i have to say this i a pretty good burger but the smashfries are the true star. The first time I went i got a made to order burger adding lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, cheddar, smash sauce, pickle and bacon on a 1/3 pound burger and traditional bun. This was a good juicy burger with the bacon being pretty tasty. It was also pretty filling for it's size.

The next time i got the arizona burger which is a 1/3 pound burger, peper jack cheese(?), chipotle mayo, guacamole, lettuce, onion, jalepeno, and some spicy bun the type escapes me. The flavors worked well together and i was impressed that while a spicy flavor came through so did each individual element. Even with the jalepenos there wasn't a really fire or burn to overpower the burger but a nice heat. It was a good specialty burger but i would prefer grilled onions on it.

The thing that will keep me coming back however is that smashfries which are great and the rosemary and garlic taste is just a perfect balance. No ketchup needed here the flavors are enough themselves. I have had the fries at 5 Guys, Delux, Joe's farm grill and these may be my favorite.

Also a nice touch with the close location to ASU is that they do except sun dollars. For a price that falls between McDonalds and more gourmet burger places this is a winner for flavor and value. With other choices like Chuckbox, 5 Guys, Whataburger, and 4 Peaks in the area this still is the best."}
{"text":"My order gets screwed up every time! I came here yesterday and they forgot to put bacon in my bacon avocado club! Yello, anyone home? They also forgot my 2nd order of fries, which I had to remind them about. The fries are GREASY and GROSS and DRENCHED in oil. This is a symptom of frying in oil that is not hot enough. Although easily remedied, this is a chronic problem at this location. Squeeze the fries sometime when you get home and see what comes out.

The portions are TINY! I was shocked at the size of the bun on my chicken sandwich. It was smaller than a McDonald's hamburger!

I have given them many chances, yesterday's visit was the last. I can tolerate having my order screwed up only so many times and complaining each time to management. It doesn't appear that the company cares about the performance of its locations. There is a wonderful new hamburger place just down the street (rhymes with rabbit) that I'll be taking my business to.

Goodbye Smashburger!"}
{"text":"The floors are full of grease so watch your step because you might slip and fall. I asked the cashier why the floors were so slippery and she said it's from all the grease cooking. I haven't been to Smashburger in a while because I've been trying to eat more healthy less greasy food but I got a gift card for Christmas and wanted to give my taste buds a treat. I ended up paying about $27 in total for three meals one kids meal and two burgers with a Side of fries. Talk about expensive. The burgers were tasty of course but the hygiene in the store is what I am most concerned about. Mother is disabled and I wouldn't dare take her to Smashburger because she would fall. I'm only giving three stars to smash burger because the food was tasty, it was a grease filled store and expensive. Don't think I will come back any time soon."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the new burger joint so we stopped in for a burger fix. I looked at there menu online and noticed a few things that excited me: veggie fries and they serve beer. 

They don't have their liquor license yet cause they are brand new, but They have malt shakes, bottled root beer,  water and the standard soda fountain. What intrigued me was their menu-nice and simple. The place looks cool too. Big red words on the wall and lots of booth and half booth seating inside. They have a small outside eating area if you want to be in the breeze. Here's the review breakdown. 

Ambiance: nice and casual with a hip feel to it. They play alternative music and some yuppie stuff, too. Seating is comfortable and plentiful. 

Service: good. Cashier in the front and they bring you your food if you are eating in. Nice people and it looks like there's only 3 running the front. More than enough. 

Cleanliness: I posted a picture of the floor. Under majority of empty seating we saw food, napkins and other various trash. One booth still had food on the seat so we moved. You may see greasy fingerprints on the leather booth chairs, too. What worries me is that a dirty eating area sometimes reflects the kitchen cleanliness. Despite this, I needed to try it to review so we stayed, but I usually walk out when I see this. Burger joint or not--dirty floors are unacceptable in any eating establishment whether cheap or expensive. They do keep the tables tops fairly clean.

Food: I made my own burger with their smash sauce, side of sweet potato fries, a sin city burger with smash fries and a plain dog with veggie fries. Just to let you know they don't ask how you want your burger cooked. 

Make your own burger:  My burger was salty like they overdid the seasoning on the patty. They also left a bit of cheese on the patty that they pulled off when they realized I ordered without. That left a nice, shiny top to my burger patty. Their smash sauce is mustard mixed with mayo and a bit of salt and pepper.  Bun was nice and light (egg bun) and slightly sweet. It was okay. 

Sin city burger: The sin city burger is great for those who want a really greasy burger, otherwise steer clear. It literally dripped grease. I thought it was egg yolk but it was grease. Lots of it. We're not talking burger grease from the patty, but pure vegetable oil dripping from the burger.  We assume it was the onion rings on top and the fried egg.  They weren't drained on a towel or anything before being placed on the burger, so it was packed with oil. 

Smash dog (plain): The dog is salty hot dog goodness. It's 100% beef and it was split open.  The bun was egg bread with sesame seeds on it, and it was slightly hard.   As for their veggie fries they came out soggy. The oil temp wasn't high enough. 

The highlights  are their sweet potato and smash fries. Herb seasoned with rock salt, they were well seasoned and very good. It tasted like rosemary, thyme and parsley on there.  That was different and nice to eat at a place like this.

Will I come again? Only if I want fries and crave theirs. I don't care for the burger because it honestly looks and tastes like what my dad makes at home, but worse. I like comfort food and will pay when it's worth it, but I won't pay 4 bucks to eat their burgers again. It was too close to what anyone could do at home. They need to find a better seasoning recipe or different way to shape the patties..something to make them stand out more than flattening a patty on a hot flat top. Maybe charbroiled or grilled, otherwise I'll go to dad's and pay him. 

To justify my review, I'm one to love a good burger once in a while.  I love fast food and diner burgers when they are good, but this one was okay but not worth going out to pay for.  It's a good stop for fries, beer (when they get it) and a shake but the burgers didn't impress me enough to justify coming back again. I think I'll do another review six months from now to see if they improve.  I hope to God they clean up the floors and seats better, because any place that has a dirty eating area probably has a messy and dirty kitchen, too."}
{"text":"My office is nearby so I go to this location fairly often.  I'm usually pressed for time around lunch, so I always order ahead online so that I can just run in and pick up my order and bypassing the line of folks placing orders in store.  This approach normally works out.  Today however, I arrived at 11:29 to pick up my order which the online system said would be ready at 11:30 (I got my order confirmation email at 11:11).  By 11:52, I was still standing there waiting for my order.  I had been acknowledged pretty much right when I arrived, and the young lady fulfilling the orders kept asking the kitchen about where my food was, but still i waited, and waited and waited and at this point, a significant amount of time that I should have spent eating was instead spent standing around.  I get that there was a HUGE take-out order in front of me, but isn't there a way to adjust the way that the online system assigns pick up times for that?  I've used plenty of other online ordering systems that adjust wait times based on traffic in the store.  Oh, also, my fries were pretty cold because I think they'd just been hanging out for 20 minutes while my burger was being prepped...so....that was like the icing on the cake.  Next time maybe I'll just use the drive thru or order at the counter because THOSE orders were being processed pretty quickly (versus thh person who planned ahead to \"save time\")"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of their olive oil, rosemary, sweet potato fries. Last night was the first time I got to have the whole enchilada. I had a Groupon that was about to expire so we went here with the Mrs. & kids. I was surprised that the kids meal $3.99 came with a HUGE burger, milk, and fries. Beat that McDs!

Another surprise was that they have BEER! Not just any beer. They had Blue Moon in a bottle (came with a frosty mug) for $2.99!!! It pretty much made me a SB fan right away. The original smash burger $4.99 had huge egg buns with all the fix'ns. The meat looked like it had been smashed against the griddle, so the name made sense. The regular smash fries were kinda blah.

They do have cheap wines in little bottles, but I'm glad a fast food chain took the effort to include good beer at a reasonable price. I'm sold."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding. Customer service was beyond expected especially from a burger joint. Mike and Gerson were checking on us and helped us out since it was our first time here at smash burger. Thanks to their service and the great food we will definitely be checking into the restaurant once a week. Food was amazing!  I recommend the Arizona grilled chicken"}
{"text":"found myself at pearson and felt hungryyyyy

saw smashburger! hmmm....looks interesting! never heard of smashburger before ...pictures look appetizing....it was either that or some food court chinese fastfood which looked pale and ewww...

ordered the kids cheese burger, 2 classic smashes and a side order of sweet potato fries, and an oreo milkshake! 

son loved the cheeseburger! according to him it was cheesy goodness....came with fries and a drink. fries were crispy and seasoned well! tasted like mcdonalds fries so all good! 

the classic smashburgers came with cheese! its size was at least a quarter pounder. way better than mcdonalds for sure! patty was juicy and seasoned well. cheese was oozing with cheesy goodness...lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and crisp! reminds me of in and out burger in cali. 

sweet potato fries were awesome too. seasoned well! crispy and had bite, just like the fries. 

my only problem is that the qty is so few. its obvious that they are skimping on the qty. the holder easily swallows the serving of the fries...to think that the classic burgers dont come with fries - yes you read it right! no combos here...u gotta order the sweet potato fries separate as well as regular fries. only kids meals and chicken fingers come with fries. 

one good factor is that they make the burgers as you order. there is a few minutes wait as the patties are cooked to order. didnt taste like frozen patties but freshly made. not to be out done, even the bun was good. so soft and moist! not stale and unassuming like most burger joints. you can literally appreciate the quality of the bread too. 

the oreo milkshake was amazing! takes me down memory lane of the milkshakes at shake shack in nyc. its that good! boom! well worth the calorie intake! 

overall, i had a good experience! drinks were unlimited refills and staff were quick and efficient! always service with a smile! 

happy eating!"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS IF I COULD!!!! Do NOT visit this location. 

Visited Smashburger today and had a HORRIBLE experience. Was with a friend who explicitly ordered a gluten-free bun with her burger because she has celiac disease. 

After her eating some of the burger, she realized it was not gluten-free and went to ask for a refund. The manager and staff were terribly unprofessional and dealt with the issue horribly. They were argumentative with her about the validity of her allergy, and they were hesitant to give a refund or deal with the issue properly. 

I would not recommend this location if you have any dietary restrictions because they completely ignore their responsibility to respectfully deal with any allergies. 

Her allergy is serious, and the fact that they placed the blame back on the customer was absurd. Very disappointed with this Smashburger location and all of the staff. I'd never expect a manager to be so extraordinarily unprofessional and disrespectful. I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect but they had exceeded my expectations. On our way down to Vegas I was tired of the food we had and couldn't find a place to eat on such a late hour. Instead of in and out where everybody has them. We went to smashburger and boy we were satisfied when we left. High quality burger and ingredients, fresh to order."}
{"text":"Burger was great, but really super small...I guess I did not know I needed to be on a diet."}
{"text":"Great food but horrible manager....he is more concerned about taking out the garbage than my order! Good still great however."}
{"text":"They allow a homeless man to solicit to the customers while you are eating and he begs you for money. I watched as it made the customers feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Food is ok, a chicken sandwich is pretty much the same everywhere (just not as expensive). The sweet potato fries were good, but they should come with the sandwich.  

Employers were nice, clean dining room although quite cold.

Will be back if I'm in the area but won't go out of my way to go here"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place I really really did. I mean come on they have fired pickles!

But when Fried Pickles were the highlight of the meal it's not a good sign, afterall their name isn't Smash Pickle.

The burger was OK, I've had better, the way they prep them is a little odd, They take black angus beef and slam it onto a hot griddle, it's all smooshed down, and while the crispy char on the outside is nice, the burger came out a little dry for my liking.

The fries were nothing great, and as I stated earlier the Fried Pickles were the highlight of the meal.

The place is quite small, and even after bussing most of the tables were still drity. 

In a city with a million burger places you need to do something to stand out and I don't think they did."}
{"text":"Great service for a fast food joint and the black bean burger is a great veggie option! It's rare to find a good, filling veg burger from fast food places so definitely give it a shot! An underrated burger for sure. And the smash fries are"}
{"text":"Had the Classic Smashburger. Just an average cheeseburger for $5 (no cheeseburger is worth more than $3). I like In N Out burger better and the cost is more in the $3 range. The egg bun got soggy after 2 bites. The store is clean and service was OK. I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"This Smashburger location is sort of hidden behind a Chipolte. Excellent service. Hardly anyone there at 12:45pm on a weekday.

Food: I have always had problems with Smashburgers. The egg buns always disintegrate after a bite or two leaving me with a handful of burger and veggies and sticky condiments. My daughter suggested that I use the build your own burger option ($4.99 for the regular size) and try a different type of bun. I did this time and it worked. I selected the multigrain bun and it held up for the whole sandwich. A far as the burger meat, I prefer In and Out burger for a chain burger. I tried the Smashfries (olive oil and rosemary sprinkled on fries $1.99 for a regular size) and I got a to-go classic cobb salad for dinner later in the day ($6). All the food was OK, not outstanding. The classic cobb salad has a fried egg instead of a hard boiled egg (I would have preferred the hard boiled egg for texture).

Parking is plentiful and close to the door. It will be interesting to see if this Smashburger can survive with the intense competition within walking distance from this location (In and Out Burger, Ike Love's Sandwiches, Chipolte, Carl;s Jr, McDonalds, plus many other chains)."}
{"text":"Had the Classic Smash (a cheeseburger on a egg bun) for $5.39 with tax. Not quite as good as a $2.99 In N Out cheeseburger and way inferior to a Lobby's cheeseburger (my favorite). The egg bun gets soggy after a couple of bites, leaving you with a mushy mess. They seem to confuse the concept of a juicy burger with a greasy burger--this was just a greasy burger. 

Pros: The store was clean and I was waited on promptly. The food arrived quickly and they have staff bus the tables rather than having customers dump the trays.

Cons: I arrived at 10:30am, the door was locked even though the sign said they open at 10am. When someone inside heard me pulling on the door they came to unlock the door. The real negative is that it is located at Tempe Marketplace, with its crazy parking lot and nasty hikes in the heat to the stores and restaurants. If I had not been here to see a movie, I would never have chosen this location."}
{"text":"Fresh and hot burger, veggies were crisp. Staff were efficient and very pleasant. Restaurant was clean despite how busy it was. 

3 of us - ordered a couple regular Smash, a Baja with pouting and a couple milkshakes. Shy of $40 which we thought was reasonable for the quality of ingredients they are using. 

If I was to complain about anything, would be that a serving of fries seems light but frankly it's more than sufficient for one."}
{"text":"All those three states are fit the lady who despite saying the exact same thing over and over and over again said it with a smile. She was present and efficient. Heck I'd give get all five stars. The food... Well it's junk-ish foods at best, and there is no saving grace for it..but seriously smash burger you should consider give this gal Aleese or whatever her name is a serious raise for the easy she approaches the task."}
{"text":"We've been to this location several times. Our order is always correct and ready when we pick it up. The interior is smallish, but the food is good. This place  is a good, get messy kind of burger place. But don't be fooled, they also offer chicken too! They even have fried pickles and sweet potato fries! All of the employees we've encountered were super nice and friendly. It does tend to get expensive, everything is ala carte."}
{"text":"I love everything about Smash Burger.. EXCEPT that time I asked for the Veggie Frites raw and NOT flash fried and they refused to serve them to me, which just tells me they're frozen and never fresh.. But who goes to a burger place for healthy sides, huh? But seriously, that's the only draw back, you can get a super healthy smash chicken sandwich then blow it by adding Veggie Frites.. Darn it all! It doesn't stop me from going though.. YUM! And, bonus, we get coupons all the time by email or by completing an online survey, and they'll let you use two per purchase since we would normally just pay for two meals separately anyway to take advantage of two coupons.. Ha!"}
{"text":"The hype of this place let me down. I was so excited to finally try this place and after the yelp holiday bazaar my friend and I were starving and decided to try it out. I'm a girl who loves her cheeseburgers, but this place just did not win me over. I asked the casher what the best one was and I went for the Sin City burger. I also got the chili cheese fries and my friend and I both decided that those were a major let down. so bummed! My burger was just as this star review says, \"meh. i've experienced better.\" it even left me with a stomach ache the rest of the evening.
The layout of this location was a little odd too. the soda machines are hiding on the other end. The people were nice, but that really was the highlight. For the price I don't even think I would be back. I'll stick to five guys."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the level of service, especially from the manager on duty. I placed an online order, immediately after placing the order, received my confirmation that my order would be ready in over 15 minutes. I drove there, and and about 20 minutes after placing my order, my order had not yet been started. I was a bit annoyed after a long day, the point of ordering take-out was for the convenience factor. As I stood there, it took forever to even be acknowledged by the man behind the counter. Once I was acknowledged by someone else, the manager came to me with a very unprofessional demeanor with, \"Hey what's up man?\". As a manager trying to resolve an issue, I would never speak to a customer like that. When I questioned him on my order, never once did he take ownership or offer the very simple apology I was looking for. All he could say was \"there's nothing I can do.\" A simple apology would have been sufficient. As a customer, I took my business elsewhere and will never be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for burgers on the way home. When we got home and unwrapped our food I was disappointed to find sloppily thrown together burgers that would rival your worst McDs experience. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Nice staff...aight burgers, but nothing to write home about though...prices decent...was good for a quick meal after crusting out in the AZ 109 degree temperature. Don't think I'll be runnin back."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, friendly staff, and good selection of music. Smashburger leans towards healthy with the selection of 3 sizes of burgers, grilled or breaded chicken, and a black bean burger for vegetarians. They have a great selection of sides. Also choice of toppings is awesome."}
{"text":"Finally a Smashburger in my area of town. I had the make your own burger grilled chicken with everything and smash fries. Service was fast and everyone was talkative and friendly. Food was good and delicious like all their food. Chicken juicy and cheddar cheese was melted just right. Bun was grilled perfectly and not dried out. Veggies were fresh and crisp even at 8:30pm. Smash fries were seasoned just right, not under seasoned or over. I was asked a couple time how was the food and if it wanted anything.

It is located where Elevation Burger was at. So I highly recommend this place if you want a burger. Next time I will try out the spicy bean burger an veggie frites."}
{"text":"First time eating at SmashBurger. Had the Bbq Bacon and Cheddar burger and the Buffalo Smash fries. The food was terrific! Fresh and HOT! The service was amazing! Friendly, fast, and Emily went out of her way to make sure she delivered the same smile and level of service to every patron in the place!

Great job!"}
{"text":"I love a greasy burger joint so I wanted to try Smashburger.  I took my order to go.  The layout of the store is different than most burger place...a rather minimalist front counter.  The service was quick, and I received my food in a reasonble amount of time.  It was hot and fresh.  I ordered the 1/3 Smashburger with everything and Smashfries.  The burger was ok.  It was spiced in the same way that Hamburger Works or the Chuckhouse does their burgers.   The veggies on the burger were fresh.  The bun started to fall apart about the time I finished the burger.  overall...it was just ok.  It ain't no Lenny Burger.  I'd rather go to Fatburger then Smashburger.  The fries were crispy and flavored.  They were good.  When I first saw them I thought the portion was rather small, but when I took it out of the box in which they came, it appeared to be a normal portion.

I won't avoid the place if people want to go there...but I won't make a special trip."}
{"text":"As a build-a-burger place, Smashburger rises above the rest. The smashing effect is just that, smashing. Deliciousness is to be had here. If you are looking for the best designer burger place, you've found it."}
{"text":"Another great burger place for fast/casual dining. I had some sort of breakfast burger here & it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"i had an avocado burger with jalapeños and onions ! it was pretty delicious although I don't recommend the whole grain buns here they're not that good . my boyfriend had a big bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg. it  was really good! We both had smash fries which were not too bad.  Don't get if you don't like rosemary because if had a strong taste of it. Overall it was not too pricey but service and staff was amazing ! Definitely a MUST try !"}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good but my boyfriend and I were there late one night and got to talking with the workers and I have to say the people who work there are sweet angels"}
{"text":"So when we were looking at the menu and asking questions they asked us if it was our first time here which it was so he made some suggestions and it was worth listening too... I had been wanting to try fried pickles for a while so when he suggested them for a side I was excited to order them and how awesome is it that I can add an ice cold beer to my meal for $1?? I wasn't disappointed at all.. After a few minutes at the table he brought out our burgers and sides, we asked for more ranch which he promptly returned with. A few minutes into our meal he stopped by and asked us how we liked everything and was very polite!! I have returned 3 times since then and still have yet to be disappointed!! Sometimes I wish they were open 24hrs so I could get fried pickles every time I crave them!! I have even gone to the extreme of waiting outside for them to open after I had been at starbucks and was staring at the building while in the drive-thru waiting for my drinks!!"}
{"text":"Always love their burgers as well as the options they have to get them custom made.  Always fresh ingredients and made to order and not just sitting in the back under a heat lamp.  Awesome fries and beverages as well.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a Cheeseburger in forever and wanted one so bad!! The only place I could think of was SmashBurger, as it's right next to my weekly grocery store. 
I wasn't at all disappointed! The burger was perfect....slightly sloppy, juicy, big enough where you had to open your mouth a little wider than norm to bite it and on a soft bun. The SmashFries are good too and even better dipped in SmashSauce. 
And, if your a stickler about good customer service....you won't be disappointed by the friendly staff here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food burger spot around. They have some great healthier options like a multigrain bun, chicken sandwiches and salads. They easily have the best fries around too. Love the Smash fries and sweet potato fries. I just wish they stayed open a little later week nights."}
{"text":"If you like salt and I mean really like salt A LOT then this is where you should go.  I know enough hamburger meat and this is if you want to extend it's \"shelf-life\" before it gets rancid then add salt to help."}
{"text":"Smashburger occupies a good burger niche between fast food and their pricier gourmet cousins.  Because sometimes I don't have the appetite for a $13 1/2lb burger but I want something more than the local burger joint."}
{"text":"After touching down in Vegas, going through the shuttle to get to the car rental center, standing in a long line, and trying to find every possible car scratch on the car rental, we were starving our butts off.  We drove aimlessly looking for a good place to eat while Yelp pulled up Smashburger as the closest restaurant in distance.  

I had the classic cheeseburger, smash fries, and a vanilla shake while my friend had the mushroom swiss burger.  OMG everything was good!! We got our shakes first and we were almost done with them before the burgers and fries arrived.  The beef patty in the burger was delicious. It definitely looks like it had just been smashed together in a patty..I think I may love it more than In-N-Out.. The Smash fries were totally smash!  It was seasoned with garlic, rosemary, and olive oil. 

Sooo good, I'm literally sitting here with my mouth watering now..."}
{"text":"When it comes to a good burger, I have to admit I'm picky.  For me nothing beats a buffalo burg at Fuddruckers.

The quality and taste at this location was 4 out of 5 stars.  I don't consider it in Fudrucker's league yet.  Nice fries, especially the deep fried pickles.  Salty but great otherwise."}
{"text":"Located inside the Rio casino in the back corner by the pretzel place, above the putting and arcade. The decor and dining area is not as nice or maintained as other locations but plenty of seating. Service is quick and nice unless someone drunk stalls the line, it's happened a few times since the club is nearby. Its open late, 4pm I believe. Burgers and fries are pretty good and fresh but there is too much rush slapping it together. Price is also pretty high even at locations not in a casino. Overall a 3-4 star and I'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"I must say, I was reticent to post a review.  We have eaten here for almost three years at least once every two weeks,. when we first started coming it was great!  Then, things went down hill for some time.  Long lines, no cashiers, clueless servers and nobody to pour your beer in an ice cold mug (which is so good), and dirty tables.  BUT, I'm thrilled to say the location has really picked if up! The last two trips were head and shoulders above what it has been for the last year or so.  Fresh, hot burgers, cashiers who know how to ring up an order, and clean tables!  The attitudes are much better also.  Whatever they have done, I hope they keep it up.  Must be new management.  Welcome back!!"}
{"text":"First experience here was great! The AZ burger was bomb!! I love how skinny the fries are as well. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This Smashburger just recently opened on 9th St and Bell, so I thought I would give it a try.  Glad I did!  The burgers and fries were great, but the customer service was even better! It was obvious I was a noob to their restaurant, but they were patient while I read the menu, and everyone was friendly and pleeasnt.  They looked like they all enjoyed working there..."}
{"text":"Awesome, most comparable to fat burger except way better.  Similar price, better tasting burger, more interesting sides, and better atmosphere and service.  The classic cheese is delicious and the spicy baha burger I had with jalepenos, pepper jack, guac, on chipotle bun was incredible.  There regular bun is an egg bread and it's perfect.  They serve great fries with or without rosemary and garlic and their fried pickles are real crispy without being greasy, the best I have had.  The haystack onions are thin sliced fried onions served with a great sauce, it all taste similar to an awesome blossom just different presentation.   

The service was fast for a made to order burger compared to slow as hell fat burger and real friendly compared to \"welcome to fat burger, what the F\".      

This isn't one of those gourmet burger spots but if you are looking for a good classic burger and fries this place rocks!

They have chicago style and chili dogs, I can't wait to try them."}
{"text":"The staff they do have is great and are always a positive experience but they are certainly understaffed.they seem to always be.in the weeds during lunch. None the less the food is always great. I have been loving the new Colorado burger with green chilis..mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"The food here is sooo good but the service is sooooo bad especially at lunch. Fries usually come out cold. There can be extremely long waits with little to know apology."}
{"text":"Service was ZERO stars.  They forgot one of our four burgers and shake.  When I finally got up to ask the dizzy and confused workers there it was...sitting on the warming shelf.  Then the shake...after asking twice for it they tried to bring it to the wrong table.  It was 3/4 whipped cream and a little bit of shake.  Embarrassing that they would allow this type of service.  The manager was rude and didn't really see to care.  Won't even get into the tattoos and the workers appearances.  

The burgers were surprisingly super greasy.  We have eaten here before and service was always lacking...but this was our last time to Smash Burger.  Today was more like Grease Burger. We all have stomach aches. 

The funniest part and we keep joking about it.  When one of my kids asked for a Cheeseburger the teenager taking our order seriously asked if he wanted chews with that. 

Suffice to say, we shall never return to this grease pit of slackers without a clue."}
{"text":"Fun fact: the truffle Swiss burger is AMAZING. I went here for the first time last week and couldn't believe how good it was. It is one of those places you think about going for days before you actually give in and make some excuse to go back (i.e. \"I parked farther away from work than usual today, I deserve a burger and fries for lunch\"). Love love love. Ignore the chain haters and those who say it is too expensive. You get what you pay for. Oh! And get the Smash fries. You can always work out tomorrow..."}
{"text":"TheBridgeLaveen after church group went to Smashburger yesterday and WOW it was a great burger.  Sunday the wait was a little long but so well worth it!!! The fries and onion straws were a yummy compliment to the juicy burger.  I will definitely go back and most definitely tell my friends to go!!!"}
{"text":"Coke Zero and Yelp check in offer for 10% off a burger combo. 1 star for each. $22 later, we agreed that a better meal and a better deal could be had at the burger place across the street: In n Out. My Smashburger was greasy, not seasoned well  and the fries were just okay. The little toddler that was walking around the patio shouting, \"F#@% YOU\" was mildly entertaining to his father, but not to anyone else. The other highlights of the visit were the dirty tables and nasty bathroom. My constant companion slipped on some grease and was forced into a spontaneous moonwalk.

Disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Just had my 1st smash burger. Had mushroom-swiss, 6.5 oz (or whatever size that is). Garlic fries, soda. 

Burger was too done for my pleasure. Next time I'll ask for MR. Not a lot of mushroom flavor imho. Swiss just so-so decent. Nice bun. Fries however, were old & cold. They weren't really cold, just warm and not hot and fresh tasting after my less than 10 mins drive home. They tasted great, but being cold within minutes, I couldn't finish them. 

Yes, the food is good. This post is just a reminder of some imperfections that could make this a better than \"ok\" place imho."}
{"text":"Not a great visit as Smashburger today. I've had Smashburger before though that was a straightforward cheeseburger and fries. Today I went for the Arizona Burger (habanero cheese, chipotle mayo, guacamole, jalapenos) and the smashfries.

The burger was properly cooked and tasty. I wasn't a big fan of the Arizona burger style - four small, thin (but fresh) jalapenos weren't really enough for the burger and the whole preparation overpowered the burger, in my opinion. I probably would've preferred it without the guac and with more jalapenos.

Smashburger has great fries but today's smashfries were luck licking a rosemary stalk - I couldn't taste anything else. I really enjoy garlic fries, and I like rosemary on some potato dishes, but I couldn't taste anything but rosemary. Tried dipping them in ketchup to offset the flavor with no luck.

They do brew their own iced tea which is a big plus with me.

$11.50 for a 1/2 lb burger, fries and drink? Bit pricey but not too bad if you share the fries with someone.

I'll be back but it will be for a more traditional cheeseburger and fries."}
{"text":"For a quick bit before a flight, nice friendly service. This location is before Security. 

Smashburger's menu focuses primarily on burgers, chicken sandwiches, and salads, with a variety of toppings and options. The restaurant serves localized burgers in each market based on regional flavors like the Sin City, Windy City, Spicy Cowboy, and others.
The company also offers a variety of sides, including sweet potato fries, fried onions, and fried pickles, as well as a vegetarian black bean burger and Veggie Frites. Desserts include shakes made with Häagen-Dazs ice cream.

The chain also serves alcohol, offering beer and wine. The restaurant teamed up with Christian Moerlein Brewing Co. to serve craft malts and beers that are indicative to the region.

Typically, remote destinations where the journey of Fishing, Kayak Fishing, Hunting, Camping is the principal goal with, some shenanigans thrown in."}
{"text":"I came to this Smashburger during a Sunday evening.

Atmosphere: Crisp, Clean
The establishment is clean, in order, and all the tables had proper table settings. Quite nice for a burger chain!

Service: Quick, efficient!
Despite the fact the place was going to close in about an hour, the cashier didn't seem too burnt out. She was actually really enthusiastic.

I was given a number stand to put on my table so that the server could deliver my food to me at my table.

My food came pretty quickly. I don't remember waiting too long for my food upon ordering.

Food: Nice, but nothing amazing
I ordered the classic burger with fries. The burger was nice and hearty. Everything on the burger was cooked thoroughly. My burger had bacon and cheese on it. The fries were a little too greasy for me, however.

Overall: Good to visit
A good place to go to when you want a burger that has a little more preparation put into it. The service is great, the place is clean, and the food isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Love it!! Sin City burger is bomb!  I have yet to try their malts.  It looks so good every time we go.  I got the grilled chicken sandwich once..i think the spicy one...that was very good! I think I can say everything i've had from there so far is yummy!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many smash burger joints and  all of them fairly good . Can't complain . Finally decided to write a review and today this location is up to par . I will return back for sure when I'm in the mood for a good classic smash burger !!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great as most smash burgers, but the customer service at this specific location was fantastic."}
{"text":"Spiked hair shift manager intentionally overcharged me and didn't give a receipt. My total was 12.52 and I had a coupon for $5 off an order over $12.00. He added something to my order then took off $5 to make it $11.96.  I'd love to hear from the franchise owner."}
{"text":"The burgers are Meh, the fries are awesome. Maybe they should be called SmashFries? But the staff is nice and place is clean."}
{"text":"A Better Burger 

Smashburger is a good choice if your looking to  have a casual lunch that is  reasonably priced. 

Smashburger offers a variety of burgers from which to choose, including build-your-own options. Smashburger has a variety of unique  side dishes, to compliment your burger.  In addition to the traditional fries offered at most burger places, Smashburger offers sweet potato fries, smashfries tossed with olive oil, garlic and rosemary, haystack onions, deep fried pickles, and veggie frites which are flash-fried carrot sticks, green beans and asparagus.

The service is pleasant, the ingredients are fresh and the food is cooked to order; if you're familiar with either In-N-Out Burger or Five Guys Burgers, the food here is arguably of similar caliber."}

Today, I had the cobb salad. I was pleasantly surprised the salad was fresh, large, and tasty. This was my first time getting a salad at Smashburger. I usually stick with the burger or chicken sandwich. However, this salad was really very good.

I'm giving it a 5 star rating because the food was great, not too expensive & the service (by Sadie at the cashier) was exceptional!!! She was so friendly and welcoming!! I will definitely be returning here in the future."}
{"text":"When you \"smash\" a burger... you are pushing out all the taste and flavor, of which this place needs some back.

The staff and counter people are AWESOME. Friendly and always willing to help. The constantly stop by your table to make sure you don't need anything.

The food is just OK. And for the higher than normal prices - you would expect more.

Overall: Underwhelming and a bit overpriced - with VERY GOOD service."}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten here -- I had tried to twice and each time I find the staff to be so snarky and crappy that I turn around and leave. The second time - today, I walked in and stood really far back from the counter, just attempting to read the menu. The girl at the counter kept repeating herself - as she needed me to pay attention to her. When I asked her to just let me look things over she approached the guy who must be her manager and the two of them made snarky remarks about me. 
Sorry I don't have your menu memorized  
I do see why this location is always empty. I liked it much better as the Blockbuster"}

{"text":"Sweet potato fries - Tastes like sweet potatoes, phew! 
Sin City Burger - Okay, but wayyyyy too salty.
Deep fried pickles - Terrible. Pickles are cut WAY too thick it's inedible because it is extremely salty and potent for something that's breaded. Cut the pickles SUPER THIN and you'll have a winner. 

Yeah. I didn't even want my leftover food packed to-go."}
{"text":"It is WRONG to love a burger this much, but the \"realness\" even impressed my hard-to-impress boyfriend.  

I get the all american burger with cheddar instead of american, smash fries, and if I'm up for a caloric splurge - a chocolate shake.  You can tell that the smash fries were potatoes very recently, and they're coated in rosemary and sea salt rather than msg.  The burger is 3-napkin juicy and it's a REALLY good burger - not a cookie cutter disc with traces of freezer burn still clinging to it.  The egg buns are nicely squishy in the middle but still slightly crusty on the outside, and the veggies actually crunch when you bite into them.  

And the Haagen Dazs milkshakes?  Yeah - those are real too.  Clearly blended from real ice cream, and a consistency reminiscent of those childhood specialties that bloomed from mom's blender when something awesome like The Wizard of Oz brought everyone together in front of the tv.  

It's kind of a weird, chrome-sterile environment to be eating such a down home meal in... but I recommend eating at the tables along the sidewalk outside - gives it a picnic-like quality."}
{"text":"How the heck have I not been to one of these franchises stateside?  Another burger joint, I get it.  How is Smashburger any different from the countless burger places that just keep popping up, well let me tell you. 

 First off, this location had a menu outdoors.  I like that.  I always feel a bit rushed to order when I get to a new spot and can't scour the menu completely.  Smashburger had me covered.  Secondly, beyond the impressive array of burger, chicken, & veggie burger items, they have a create your own section.  It is all laid out in a clear fashion with no hidden pricing.  Customize to your hearts content.

I ordered the black bean burger.  This is carnivore heaven, shame on me, right?  Wrong.  I topped that bad boy with a host of veggies and jalapenos and by the time I finished my burger not only was my mouth watering, but my eyes were too from the jalapeno heat!  No troubles though, because I washed it down with an ice cold beer.  

The only sign of trouble I had during my visit was a bit of a delay between ordering and receiving my food from a mix up in the kitchen.  The manager quickly extinguished my angst by giving me a $5 gift card.  My whole experience could not have gone any better, and for that I will soon be back."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST burgers done fast I've ever had. Not sure how anyone could say different. The burgers are incredible! The fries are ok, nothing to brag about, but not awful. The onion straws are great. But for burgers alone, done quick, they are top notch! Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the fries are lackluster. Burgers get a 5 star rating everytime, and my wife agrees. Been here ten times or so, never been disappointed. Not sure about the \"ambiance\", it's a burger place. But you can eat there and order beer."}
{"text":"The regular fries were fair at best and the cheeseburger came out medium not because I requested it that way - I think the cook was lazy. The cheese was barely melted. This place is going to have to try harder when Create Burger and In and Out are on the same street. I did get an explanation on the burger which they said it was standard to cook burger medium well.  This place is ok, nothing that blows me away."}
{"text":"My family went to smash burger this past Thursday night. We had a coupon for a buy one get one free entrée. The food was great! It always is. The only thing lacking at this location would be that the tables are always a bit dirty. It seems that they are such a busy location they could use an extra hand in the dining room.

I was most impressed by the girl at the register that I believe was the manager. A girl in front of me ordered a meal for six dollars and her debit card was declined twice. She said she would step aside so she could call her bank because she was sure she had money in there. The girl working the register said don't worry about it I've got your meal. It was very kind of her and probably made the customer feel less embarrassed. Kudos to this employee!"}
{"text":"Smashbuger on Maryland Parkway is fantastic. My family and I went there yesterdau for  late lunch . Not only is the food wonderful my SinCity Burger was very tasty with both deep fried onions strings and sauted onions with an egg and bacon and my Smashfries perfection drizzled with olive oil rosemary and garlic. The staff were friendly ,fast and efficient! The restaurant is clean and bright with music filling it. They also run specials for the poor college kids that hover near by at UNLV . If you want a burger but want more than fast food atmosphere and quality Smashburger is THE place you want to go. All round excellence!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last week; was heading into Harris Teeter for a quick healthy Odwalla smoothie. Fail :(

Detoured to the bright Smashburger sign. Am a minimalist, so felt right at home inside. Didn't want to totally blow my healthy intentions, so ordered the Black Bean burger with Smash Frites, then took a table outside in front of the fountain.

Food arrived in about 5 minutes. Server was very pleasant. Black bean burger was fantastic! Still.........my goodness............those smash frites were outstanding. The rosemary/garlic flavor, the right crisp, not oily....I kept thinking \"dam*it! Why am I just finding out about this place?\""}
{"text":"First let say that the staff were great! Allie the manager even cooked my 3rd attempt sandwich herself. They did their best to make us happy and they are the reason this review is this high. 

The food is extermemly salty, that is from 3 of us all felt the same. 

The chicken with avocado was ok. 

So hats off to a GREAT crew!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I repeat, AMAZING! Lmao. The sin city burger is SOOOOO delicious! The meat was very juicy, but not greasy. My first bite into the burger was an explosion of flavor. It was so good, I didn't wanna finish it. Lol. So hard to find a good burger place nowadays."}
{"text":"First and last visit.  Mgr. needs to pay attention to facility.  Dirty table, dirty drink station, ladies room out of drying towels (2 machines).  Food was hot but chicken was more than crispy, had to have been cooked twice!  Burger not very tasty.  No thank you"}
{"text":"I have been to Smashburger now twice.  First time was with a Yelp event, and the second time was this August long weekend.  I brought my mom and aunt there from Thunder Bay.

And man, did we eat.

I had the Saskatoon Berry Milkshake (and I got them to blend Oreo cookies into it) 
and holy moley.... I was heaven.  HEAVEN!
We got 3 different kinds of burgers, and 3 different sides, and we bellied up and pigged out.

Sides:
Deep Fried Pickles - nothing short of AMAZING
Regular Fries - AMAZING
Yam Fries - wow! Amazing with Chipolte Mayo

Burgers:
Mama got Bacon Cheeseburger
My aunt Cathy got the Calgary Burger
And I got... the Spicy Black Bean Veggie Burger.  It was VERY spicy, which made me happy.  Not always can I order something spicy and actually feel the heat.  This burger delivered spicy.

We ate in intense silence, except for the odd groan of happiness!

ON the way out, I got a second milkshake (with no oreos, since he is more of health nut) to bring home for Holger.  

When we left, my mom fell asleep in the car, still wearing her white Yelp sunglasses from two years ago to attempt to hide her nap.

We had a fantastic meal.  The burgers were all cooked to perfection, juicy, tasty and I think the little dude who delivered our burgers had the biggest, warmest smile I have ever seen.

I love you Smashburger. The only reason I don't visit more often is my need to watch my waistline. I know you have healthy choices - I saw a girl at the next table eating a delicious salad. But... my willpower is not as strong as hers."}
{"text":"I should preface this with: I don't eat meat, so I've never tried their beef or chicken entrees.  

They have nice black bean patties - try the buffalo style or the cucumber and goat cheese.  The patties are just the right amount of sea-salty, and the smashing part works well with a bean patty.  More topping variety than the usual fast-food burger shop, but nothing truly mind-blowing.  

When we lived nearby, we came here on a semi-regular basis, but it's not a place we'd go out of our way to hit.  The fries are quite nicely spiced, but otherwise unremarkable.  It's clean and the staff members are polite, plus they have two-person booths in addition to larger ones.  For fast-ish food, it's good."}
{"text":"I typically don't post bad reviews but this was definitely not good, the 30 minutes I was here, I saw 3 people with orders that took over 25 mins to get or they needed refunds. My order took more than 20 minutes to come out and all it was was 1 smash Burger and smash fries and a small order of sweet potato fries. Not only were they slow but the cashier was not good. He wasn't friendly toward customers, when he didn't have a line he was checking his phone on the table and texting, when a customer who enjoyed the shake he made gave him a tip he didn't even thank him, and I heard his cuss at a coworker who was making burgers. Definitely will be going to other Smash burgers in the area and avoiding this one..."}
{"text":"Get a microwaved burger and microwaved fries with water for a mere $21.   Doesn't come close to McDonald's.   Staff didn't not notice the ketchup was empty and splattering everyone."}
{"text":"Came in late on my only day off about 9:30 pm. Didn't have much expectation, but this place delivered. The girls helping out were very friendly. I didn't know what to order, so I asked what was good. The \"Smash Burger\" she replied. Without even looking at the menu, I agreed to the recommendation. Wow. Egg? Are you seriously awesome? Fries were o.k. seasoned, but crispy non-the-less. The only thing I didn't like --which may make others feel nice and comfy-- is the cookie-cutter atmosphere. Feels like I'm in the Smash Factory or P.F. Burger. lol. Other than that, good job guys!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok for me. The burgers are ok a bit messy and kinda dry. I did really like the smash fries but the fried pickles were grossly over salted. I prefer fatburg, in n out, or 5 guys to this spot."}
{"text":"If there's anyone on Yelp who should be set up to not like Smashburger, I'm the guy. I'm a huge burger fan, but I'm a minimalist and a traditionalist. Give me a nice, simple burger with some lettuce, pickles, a little onion, some barbecue sauce and maybe a little ketchup and I'm over the moon. Once you start throwing around words like jalapenos, goat cheese, hot sauce, etc. (in my opinion) you're unneccessarily  messing with a good thing, and to be fair Smashburger didn't do much to change that opinion... but that didn't stop me from loving it.

With most of the burgers were a little \"too much\" for my simple taste, the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger was A - F***ING - MAZING! Not only did it have the same high quality beef and fresh ingredients as the rest of the burgers here, but it had one of the best barbecue sauces I've tasted ANYWHERE (and trust me, that's one ingredient that can make or break an entire business for me, so this is a HUGE deal.) This was my absolute hands-down favorite (and I've now tried 3/4 of the burgers there).

For vegetarians, they make black bean patties for their burgers which, while I didn't try them, other people I was there with were raving about, and salads. Are you a meat eater, but not a burger fan? They've got chicken sandwiches as well.

Honestly, what stole the night for me were the sides. Smashburger takes a simple thing like fries and does them a way I've never had in a burger joint: cooked with olive oil, garlic, rosemary and seasalt. They're familiar enough as fries to not be off-putting, but have a distinct taste to them that's unlike anywhere else. They also do poutine (apparently ONLY in Calgary), and lightly fried and salted fry-like veggie baskets they call \"Veggie Frites\" (thin cut, fried and salted carrots? Strange but DELICIOUS!), and my personal favorite: FRIED PICKLES! I swear I could binge for an entire meal on just these amazing little things. Sooooooo good!

All in all, this isn't exactly my perfect establishment: a few too many options that seem to try and stick a few too many different strange flavors into a burger... but all things considered this is absolutely 100% worth checking out - if for no other reason, then to try something completely different."}
{"text":"Always a tasty burger, awesome customer service.  My thanks go out to the management for actually listening and acting upon guest surveys."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burgers, they're fresh & I couldn't get over how delicious the fries were. We did run into a couple problems but Nick the manager took care of it immediately. Jaime took our order she's a total sweety & I will be back to try out the chicken sandwichs next time.  I had a Mushroom & swiss burger but I had goat cheese instead of swiss on it. The burgers were so dang juicy. My boyfriend was even impressed & normally he's a tough guy to sway."}
{"text":"Still no call back from a manager after leaving a review here, and a voicemail at the restaurant. The managers or owners here simply do not care. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Meat and Potatoes on Smash Burger in Las Vegas NV- Potatoes are right the Smash Fries are tasty! Olive oil and Rosemary come on! Is this fast food or fine dining? This is my first time having a Smash Burger, My children have had it with their mom and this is why our son picked this for his birthday dinner with his Teammates/ Friends.
I was looking at menu board and having a difficult time deciding on what to order. The way the descriptions of the burgers are worded make them all sound so yummy!
This location would be closing shortly but the workers were so nice and accommodating. Girl that took orders even took a group picture for my son of our party. She also gave my son a free shake for his birthday! Good for my son but now my other son wants one too...
I would have to say our visit to Smash Burger was a Smash Hit!

{"text":"Have I ever been to smashburger? No. And now, I can say I have. So this place is neatly located in the stonecrest area full of restaurants and all your south side 5 second drive cravings.

My brother advised me to make my own burger. And I took his advice and did just that. I ordered an egg artisan bun, aged Swiss, tomato, lettuce, grilled onions, an egg, and mushrooms topped with spicy chipotle sauce. And of course some smash fries. How was it, you may ask?

Well, this place is definitely place on my list to come back to. The burger was juicy, and with all the condiments loaded on there it came out pretty neat. I think I could've had more out on it, but I didn't want to try my luck with a burger that topples over to the point where it isn't a burger anymore. My philosophy: it's okay for mission burritos, no good for burgers on overloading condiments. 

This place was a quick meal with a good amount of seating. With a feel of old school dining mixed in with the new. Pick up a menu, go to the counter, order, and sit down for your masterpiece (or a default burger) to come greet your burger cravings. 

Overall, this place is worth looking into if you're into burgers and a little freedom as far as creating what you want to taste. This place will be on my list if I'm in town and looking for a burger."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!! I could tell you guys that this place has the flavor I was looking for.. Exactly an orgasm I my mouth... I had an SPICY BAJA.!! It was  amazing!! Can't wait until I am back.!!"}
{"text":"Okay.. Hand down this has GOT to be the best burger place in Vegas! Food is way above par and the burgers are always so fresh! Big Smash Sin City Burger is the way to go!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"I was listening to local radio recently, and they released the results of a survey regarding the \"best burger chain in America\". According to the survey, Smashburger is rated in the top five, behind Five Guys, In-N-Out, Fuddruckers, and A&W/ http://www.marketforce.com/press-releases/item/five-guys-is-americas-favorite-burger-chain/

For the life of me, I can't understand how ANY of these places finished ahead of Smashburger. MAYBE Fuddruckers, but c'mon...the rest of that list is ridiculous, IMHO.

Now, for the most part, I try and avoid red meat. The occasional steak is alright, but I typically lean towards chicken or fish. But, there's just something about Smashburger...I think it might have a hint of Kryptonite in it. Whenever we're anywhere near Smashburger, we just have to go. (I've GOTTA double up on those self-control exercises.)

I love everything about this place. The decor is modern and clean. The digital menus add a sleek touch.The people behind the counter are always chipper and inviting. Basically, this place offers everything most people look for in a restaurant.

Now, they have a relatively diverse menu, offering different styles of pre-made burgers, ranging from the standard plain burgers, cheeseburgers, all the way up to burgers with avocado. However, I, being a mild control-freak, always create my own burger.  

My typical order consists of a regular \"Smash\" sized burger on a whole wheat bun. I get the usual lettuce, tomato, pickle...but where I add my own little twist is with the additions of bacon and jalapenos. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VaxMJX3yI4MSCIItqFiU2A&userid=IBiHQzvzP01UNuLbADSz4A The cuts of bacon they use at this joint are INCREDIBLY thick and crisp...the two best qualities of bacon! And then there are the jalapenos...holy har (BTW, \"har\" is Arabic for \"HOT!!!)!!! These jalapenos tend to leave you with a case of the sniffles. If you're not into that kind of spice on your burger, you might want to steer clear of this little addition.

Now, there are plenty of sides available here...but if you don't get the sweet potato fries at least once in your life, you're doing yourself an INCREDIBLE disservice! I don't know who the genius was who decided to start frying up sweet potatoes, but that person is my hero/heroine!

When all is said and done, you're looking at about $10/person when you eat here. When you consider the fact that this burger chain is nationally ranked, you could consider that price a bargain. If you're smart, you'll get in on the ground floor and enjoy one of these awesome burgers before they jack the prices up even higher!

On a side note, after you order your meal, you're given a number that you take to your table. Typically, the number tent you receive just has the number for your order. At Smashburger, each tent has its own little saying. That's the kind of quirky add-on that piques your interest!

Smashburger is one of the best burger joints in the country. You'd be a fool if you didn't try this place at least once!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a plain double cheeseburger with a side of their smash fries (price a little under $10). At first glance, I came to the realization that there is a running theme here in charlotte.. burgers no longer come with a side of fries and that the burger patties are small..

The establishment looked clean, but I felt like a sardine because of the amount of seating they had crammed into the restaurant.

The burger was good (7/10) but nothing special..  and left me hungry.. my roommate went ahead and ordered another burger as he was hungry after his combo as well. I lost my appetite after I found two strands of black hair in my fries.

Overall it was good! I wasn't a fan of their portions nor their food handling skills. Most likely than not, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is second only to fat burger in my opinion it's a similar burger with a lot of different toppings an extremely well put together presentation. I really think if you're looking for an excellent burger and you don't mind a little bit of a spend  and a little bit of grease you will love this place.... If you prefer a small in and out type of Patty you may not like the stick full flavored burger I for one think in and out is also very good but when I'm in the mood for substantial burger this is or fatburger are my only choice.. There are a lot of good burger places in Vegas but if you're looking for the higher and fast food you will like this place they have great toppings including truffle mayo cooked onions many different cheeses different kinds of fries and they're all very high quality. If you've never eaten here give it a try you'll probably love it like I do"}
{"text":"Meh. Service was friendly.  The burger patty did not seem to have any seasoning. The haystack onion straws were good but served very greasy, the bottom half of the order was not edible due to the amount of oil.  Sweet potatoe fries were great. I did not find the product worth the price and would rather save a few bucks and go to In n' Out or spend a few more and go to a full service restaurant."}
{"text":"Complete chaos on our first visit. Got someone else's order in our to go order. Upon arriving at our destination, the presentation of the food, we did get, was horrible. You bet I called to complain. I told manager I felt we got robbed of our $35 we spent on lunch. He mailed us $20 in gift cards to use on our next visit. Kinda feel like I got taken twice.Thank goodness there doesn't seem to be an expiration date. Take me a long tie to visit a location again."}
{"text":"Why do I keep going back? They never answer the phone, sandwiches got smaller, prices ridiculous! 11 bucks for nothing!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Smash Burger in New Orleans which was by the best, I've eaten at the location in 1000 oaks which was OK, and now Las Vegas which was shit.  N.A.S.T.Y.  The consistency of the 3 smash burgers are all different and don't taste the same.  Skip this shit shack and go next door to In and Out and have a double double.  The 2 stars were for the really good oreo cookie shake."}
{"text":"The Smashburger sells beer and wine with their obvious fare of burgers, fries, and chicken sandwich's was the selling point of Smashburger for my comrade and I. After perusing the menu on line we decided to check the restaurant out for ourselves one afternoon. 

The place was pretty deserted at about 2:00pm when we arrived for lunch. I decided on the Arizona Burger and my comrade chose the BBQ Burger. We also got an order of regular fries and and order of sweet potato fries. 

It took about 15 minutes for our food to make its way to our table, and the presentation was pretty decent overall. The regular fries and the Arizona Burger were nothing special, but I would highly recommend the sweet potato fries and the BBQ Burger! 

The whole experience was pretty decent. I wasn't wowed by the service or the food, but I was not disappointed either. Smashburger is a good choice for cheap gourmet-esque burgers and fries."}
{"text":"First timer at smash burger and it was great!  The service at this location was wonderful.  They have a good menu with lots of choices, but not overwhelming like other burger places.  I had the truffle mushroom burger with smash fries!  It was very favorful!  I also had a strawberry shake and it was delicious!  I will eat here again!"}
{"text":"We have been to this smash burger many times and usually have an enjoyable dining experience. 

Tonight my mother and two teens stopped in around 7 pm. Two teen girls wrer working. 1 on the register and the other running food. We ordered our food, and sat down. A few minutes later the first burger arrived, unfortunately it had cheese, but no condiments. We sent it back as it was ordered with no cheese. The young lady immediately took it back. But brought back a burger with no cheese, but all the condiments on the burger. My mother hand carried it back to correct. At about this time, my daughters burgers arrived. Both were ordered with only ketchup and no other toppings. Both arrived with all toppings. They just took them off rather than send them back.

The young lady checked our table 5 min later to see how the food was.  I never received my burger. After a few minutes, the young lady came back and told me that apparently the cashier never placed my order. 

My teens were already done eating and my mom was almost finished. I was informed she could charge my cc and put my order in. At this point, I said no thank you and we left.

This was the worst service ever at this restaurant, and I never even received my order.

I am sure this is a training issue, but it will be a long time before I eat here again. In-n-Out is better and they never have messed up this bad.

I"}
{"text":"The burgers should be as big as they claim. That's been an issue for me but I went there again because I had gift cards. My kids were served their burgers and were basically done before I got my chicken sandwich. So got a to go box and ate alone at home. They need to bring the whole order at the same time!

Went again today and my son ordered the triple double (granted he gets none of the condiments) but for 7 bucks the burger should be a good size, we only saw cheese. The regular burger my other son got was bigger. Boo! They really need consistency when preparing the burger!"}
{"text":"Went to desert ridge thought I'd go to get salad at Paradise bakery opps they are gone. Went to Smashburger ate a bunless burger a little greasy but okay. What really didn't go over was how filthy the dining room was. Garbage and food on the floor and many empty tables not cleared off. Although looks like only the order taker and cook were there this was still unacceptable. Many people came it while I was there, one couple looked at the tables and just took good to go.  Another older couple looked around and the woman helped herself to paper towels to clean a table as none were clean. Not blaming anyone working there but maybe add to the help so the dining room area was more appealing. Trying to unload video"}
{"text":"Holy cow (may he rest in peace), they make a good burger!

Now I can eat a 6 pound burrito without taking a breath, but there's something about burgers where my appetite suffers.  I love a good burger, but about halfway through, I fall apart.  The meat just makes me sick.  I end up throwing it out and eating the bun.  Not at Smashburger.

I can order a small Smash and eat every last bite, and still want more!  And their fries are among the best out there.  I'm not sure what there isn't to like about it.  I guess I'll have to find an excuse to head to Marketplace this weekend and see if I can find something."}
{"text":"Yay!  A Smashburger closer to me!

Burgers are always fresh, and I love the smash.  No shrunken patties that become a thick glob of meat.  Not only does it stay nice and uniform, but it has the wonderful sear as well.  I always go with the Classic Smash, although I was able to sample some of their other options at a recent event.  I was shocked I liked the black bean patty!  The toppings are always fresh, too.  No wilted lettuce here.  And their fries are really good, too!  

The employees always provide great service, and seem happy to have a customer.  A novel concept in this industry.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"First timer at Smashburger.... Food was good. Nothing really out of the ordinary. The person taking my order, and we ordered for a large party, had no interest in listening to what I wanted to order. When I saw my receipt and noticed he did not put in one of the burgers correctly, we went back and asked for the change. He went to the kitchen and said it was taken care of. When I got home and pulled out that burger, it was incorrect. Outside of that, it's a nice establishment on the inside, plenty of places to sit, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I should give this 4 stars, the only reason I didn't is that I never eat there - what is wrong with me?  I guess its too many calories or something.  Good food, limited menu, love the fries and burgers, which it was less expensive and less fattening somehow."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Ballantyne!  The foods is hot, fresh, and amazing! Never had a bad meal! The milkshakes are awesome too."}
{"text":"I tried the Smash fries and they are SO good. They are seasoned with olive oil and some spices and blow their regular fries out of the water."}
{"text":"2nd time going to this burger place 1st time great. 2nd time which was the next day, never in my life i have had the worst customer service from beginning to end with marcus a manager of this place acting very unprofessional, childish with offensive comments one after the other. from me wanting to download the app marcus saids if i want to hold up the line, to getting my order wrong when i asked for no bacon, to asking whats the price difference if i get a shake with my combo. he starts naming flavors of shakes which clearly means he wasnt paying attention to nothing i said since he couldnt make eye contact while taking our order. when asked to redeem the app coupon he tells me he didnt think i ws serious about using the coupon and couldnt do it. so for 5 mins im explaining to him how to do his job by voiding the ticket and re ring it up. which is ws just to lazy to do since he keep telling me im going to make him work all for $4 and how he can afford not to save $4. as i own 3 successful companies, standing in my suit im flabbergasted by each and every rude comment by the manager. how did he get this position. my food waa missing fries for it being a combo also sdo as i stand watching them make my food because marcus went in the back to do idk what im making sure he doesn't spit or play with my food and he tells me so u going to stand and eat. comments never stopped and no wonder my order was wrong i see a cook eating and working!!!!!!! the general manager thank god comes out to bring the food and i tell her half of everything because i was so furious to where i was shaking and didnt eat the food she asked what can she do so she took off 2 burgers i was with my husband  n son. im contacting corporate because he cant treat paying customers like the way i was treated or needs to find a job that he can actually do because this is too hard for him. if i was a shoppers failed is an understatement. marcus is very disrespectful, rude, asshole which gives this smashburger a bad reputation and bad taste in your mouth before even getting to eat the food."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first Smashburger. Everyone liked the buns they use and we all liked the fries because they reminded us of Feddy's fries which we . The burgers were good, I liked the leaf lettuce, red onion, red ripe tomatoes and kosher pickles on the original, makes the burger have a fresh taste. We ordered some fried pickles which were good too. Everything is a la carte but the kids meals are a little combo at least ;)"}
{"text":"I am a self professed burger connoisseur..ever since I was young my favorite meal has often had \"burger\" in it. I ordered the Bacon cheese burger. The bun was perfectly fresh and soft. The meat was juicy, tender and cooked to perfection. The free extra's and chipotle sauce is amazing.

The service was top notch and even though this was my first visit, this place rocketed to #1 for burgers in my book."}
{"text":"I love a good burger! Can't say I love this place.

I was excited to try this place when it opened. I made one visit there and haven't been back since. 

I don't remember what I ordered as it was sometime ago. Obviously was unimpressed with their burger. I do recall throwing the fries away they were disgusting enough to be memorable.

On the plus side the place was neat and clean, The staff was friendly and quick enough. The food just didn't appeal to me.

Would I give it another try? I just don't think so unless someone else was buying."}
{"text":"I'll give it to you straight.. The staff are excellent but other than that this place sucks and I'm talking about the food. Two burgers, two fries, two cokes = 20 bucks? These hamburgers are nothing special. Kinda salty, kinda mushy and could not finish it. The fries are tasteless and over cooked. I heard all kinds of raves about this place, but I just don't understand. We were going to go to Johnny Rockets next door, but decided to try SmashBurger. I like Johnny Rockets..This was a waste of time and money. We could have gone to McDonalds and got better food for 10 bucks and I hate McDonalds. I feel bad for the staff because they are well trained and professional..too bad they have to sell a shit product. Really, really bad..."}
{"text":"If you like a good burger....and you're not quite dressed to be dropping a few dollars at a classy Vegas Steakhouse, or In-N-Out is not in the cards, then check out Smashburger.  This Denver chain is growing in the Vegas Valley and there is good reason why.  They begin with fresh, not-frozen, 100% certified Angus beef that's literally smashed on a buttered grill for ten seconds with a cookie-cutter-style press. This searing process locks in the juices, and then the meat patty is seasoned with Smashburger's garlic and herb mix. Put it on a soft, delicious Artisan-style bun and add the extras to order. The end result? A five-napkin burger that tastes as good or better than homemade. Ready to eat in about six minutes. How can you beat that? 

There's several variations on the Smashburger theme: the Classic, the All American, the Sin City Smashburger, the BBQ Bacon and Cheese, the Spicy Baja and the Mushroom Swiss. Or make your own from a combination of the menu-item ingredients. The best part? Fresh ingredients, not frozen. The veggies aren't pre-packaged; they're cut on site. The seasonings and sauces are Smashburger's proprietary recipes. This is high-quality, cooked-to-order fast food. 

What's a burger without fries? Smashfries are of the retro, shoestring style. They're deep-fat fried in tallow and oil, mixed with rosemary, extra virgin olive oil and garlic. The Sweet Potato Smashfries are made the same way, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. There's also the Chili, Cheese or combination Chili-Cheese Fries. Veggie Frites is a yummy, albiet greasy, fries substitute: a slightly-crunchy combination of flash-fried asparagus, carrot sticks and green beans. Another notable side is the tasty fried dill pickles served with a creamy buttermilk ranch dressing.

And what's a burger and fries without a shake? Take your pick of a vanilla, chocolate or strawberry shake or malt with the consistency of soft-serve, blended with whole milk and Haagen-Daz ice cream. The tangy fresh lime shake was not-too-sweet, and the classic root beer float could double for dessert."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Amazing service. Amazing food! Amazing shakes. I would recommend this place over any other burger place."}
{"text":"I've always dined at this Smash Burger with no problems.  Until these last 2 visits.  This is the second time we dined here that the order of large fries I ordered were extremely low in quantity.  The first time it happened, I didn't say anything because I thought maybe it was a mistake on my part.  But tonight, I had the same exact problem.  My French fries came and I asked the team member if those were the large fries I ordered.  She said yes.  Wow!  It had about barely a handful of fries.  She did, however, gave me another order of fries after I mentioned to her that the quantity of your large fries do not pass for \"large\".   As a frequent diner at Smash, I noticed the drastic change in this quantity.  

How come this place is always so dirty inside and the bathroom is always so gross?

I understand there is a large volume of traffic due to the fantastic burgers (which is why my family and friends always go back).  But seriously....the dining tables and restrooms are always so gross.  Every single time.  Maybe it's cleaned just once a day?"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Smashburger in years but today a friend offered to buy lunch and wanted to go there so I gave it another shot! 

I was surprised at how reasonably priced everything was on the menu (for some reason, I had thought it was going to be more on the expensive side).  I ordered the avocado club, with beef and smash fries and it was the perfect lunch! All toppings on the burger were fresh, the fries were a tad greasy for my usual preference but overall quite delicious and I'll definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"The burgers at this place are delicious, ours came very hot and very fresh. If you want something healthier than french fries, you can order their vegetable frites, which are fried green beans and carrots and are quite yummy. If you are in a decadent mood, order a milkshake. They are very creamy and made with Haagen Daz ice cream. The calorie count is huge but they are delicious!"}
{"text":"The Arizona Burger is the one you want if you have a taste for the spicy! I love this place. Not a fan of burgers, but thisplace definitely makes me one everytime we go there. Check it out. They will do anything you want to your burger as well. 

I also love the Vegie Frites. (Asparagus, Carrots, and Green beans) flash fried in Rosemary and olive oil. AWESOME! But you must eat them hot. Once they get cold, the oil solidifies and then you get mad at yourself for eating something that you chose to be healthy and now find out is not so much. lol. 

Service is fast, restaurant is clean and burgers are juicy!"}
{"text":"First time and I loved it! Food was delicious, hot, and fast. They're salted caramel shake was to die for and they're customer service is top notch. I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Arizona burger was awesome, as usual. You can't stop eating the Smash Fries. The employees at this location were extremely nice."}
{"text":"What can I say. Slow service, the food was just ok, and the guy completely forgot the lettuce and tomatoes... Owe yeah and it was like a freezer in there. So never again."}
{"text":"First I'd like to say I love smash burgers food. They are one of my favorite places for lunch. With that being said the service at this location is sub par and needs to be addressed. The staff was arguing in front of customers. I don't think it's very professional to be telling your boss that you need someone to cover for you because you were throwing up, in front of a customer while they are in the middle of an order. The supervisor was also visibly annoyed and responded very passively. It made for a very awkward and uncomfortable customer experience.  Then when my food was finally brought out they didn't even put dressing on my salad. Multiple customers were having similar issue with orders which ties back to a staff that isn't working together.  Maybe it's better in the evening but the daytime experience at this location leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Now I like smash burger, but this location is terrible.  Service is slow, very slow.  Last 3 times when I went there at various times during the day.  Only 1 person serving last 2 visits, manager just clearing tables and not helping.  9 people in front of me and after 10 mins she was still serving the same couple.  Walked out."}
{"text":"Service was just okay. The employee mentioned they were having trouble because they didn't have enough people. The burgers were very bland. We ordered an avocado club burger and bacon cheesburger. The avocado burger had no avocado on it. The bacon cheeseburger came with a single slice of bacon that barely covered half of the burger. Several customers left while waiting for their orders to cook or had food prepared not how they ordered and the employee working the front was apologising to everyone for one reason or another. They ran out of cups after we arrived and the tables were filthy. 

For the price of two meals ($22) we could have eaten much better food at Five Guys."}
{"text":"I hate bashing new and upcoming food place here @ Laveen. But when we pay almost triple the price for the same item in near businesses then we have a problem. 

Let me list the reasons that smash failed at:

1. Bland flavor, their famous classic smash burger was bland, and that's with 2 patty's that I ordered. I took 2 bites- and I was done.
2. Oily fries. I kid you not, our fries basket was dripping with oil- if that's your thing come right in.
3. Pricey- the price is ridiculous. For the burger that's no problem, but to get an extra 3.99 for just a regular fries and a regular drink? That's a meal on another business-LOL! For 2 people you might end up paying 25 bucks for 2 burgers... 
4. Register not paying attention, I ordered to dine in, I got to go. First thing I asked the moment I walked in if their participating in the BOGO- still charged without the BOGO, had to remind her yet again before I got charged. Alot of talking between the teenagers that runs the place, unfortunately less working. 



I should took the sign when I saw the manager and one worker from smash walking away from dunkin donuts buying what looks like a shake (which smash has), and something for lunch. When workers don't eat what their selling, that's a huge sign!

Take this review and save your money. And when I say I would rather eat from McDonald's or Carl's Jr across the street then that says alot. I have eaten at a Smash before and I actually liked their classic but I never remembered it to be this bland and to be so oily. I ALSO want to add how they advertise that's their meat is fresh- I beg to differ. Go try Wendy's burger in 35th ave... you'll taste the big difference!! 

I believe that the owner can make this work, if the right people are hired, it feels like there's no quality at all on the food their serving... sorry to say but I don't see this place staying there for long."}
{"text":"Very fast good burger. Everything is very fresh. If you order smash fries they are thin and delicious. The staff is friendly and its not very expensive. You can start with a classic which is pretty good. They also have a spicy version which has fresh cut jalapenos and fried pickles that kind of resemble chicken nuggets. I usually stop on my way home from the Starbucks. You can ever pre order the food online and pick it up. Good stop."}
{"text":"Smashburger serves up some juicy burgers and tasty fries, but the availability of much better burgers makes Smashburger a place not worth visiting.

FOOD
Smashburger features the standard option of several burgers, the ability to custom make burgers, fries, and shakes. There are also several side and appetizer options. The food tastes good, but the menu is completely uninspiring. The pre-designed burgers are nothing special, just the standard varieties that you've seen just about everywhere else. The toppings for custom-made burgers are nothing out of the ordinary either. C'mon, people, offer something unique. Give me a reason to come here instead of other burger places.

I will give Smashburger kudos for their buns, which are slightly chewy and much better than the dry mess most places use, but, please, offer some unique toppings, a rotating \"burger of the day\", some unique or rotating sides, etc. When choosing a burger place to go to, there are just too many other choices to warrant a repeat visit to Smashburger.

PRICE
I absolutely cannot stand burger places that feature everything a la carte. Fries and a drink should always come with a burger. I just do not understand how $15 for a burger meal is acceptable.

SERVICE
You place your order and pay at the counter, they bring the burger to you, and you're responsible for refilling your own drink. Not much to say here.

Overall, Smashburger is \"just another burger chain\". It is much better than the fast food alternatives, but in a crowded field of local burger eateries, many of whom offer very unique burgers priced accordingly, Smashburger just does not stand out and offers no reason to visit."}
{"text":"*NO STARS*
Dumb m.f dont know how to take an order. I had to go back TWICE for my order with 4 kids I dont have the time or gas to wast. I was angry when I went back a SECOND TIME I am tryin to keep my kids from running around and stumbled over a word  the little kid cashier with the messed up face thought it was funnie which insted of being apologetic his dumb ass thought it was funny. Never never never going back to this place they always have and excuse for thir f-ups."}
{"text":"I brought my GF here to prove that the hulk SmashBurger was better than 5guys. Bad choice of location!
I've been to the camelback and avondale location and I was very satisfied. This Tempe Smash was dirty and a swing of the kitchen door, it was even more dirty in back EWW. The cashier lady was nice and helpful except for the price she gave me 17 bucks for two burgers \"1w/Bacon&Jalenpenos\" and fries...Ouch My Pocket! No doubt SmashBurgers are amazing just guess the two guys in back were more interested in the RapMusic and smiling or laughing at customers than making my burger. They messed up my order with condiments and burgermeat wasn't cooked correctly and tasted wack. Deciding to go back to complain I decided to waste my time on Yelp. 
My GF loves when I'm wrong. Should've went with chinese...Ill go back to SMash but NOT Tempe Smash to prove her wrong."}
{"text":"PRETTY DAMN GOOD 

This one is inside the Caesar palace casino food court area & you just go right up & order then they give you a buzzer to pick up your food.... it was our FIRST TIME... guess it was written on our expression as the cashier guessed & said it's our first time... ahahhaa

CHICKEN FINGERS - I'm gonna have to say these chicken fingers definitely reminded me of chicken fingers that i used to eat when i was a kid & it brought back so many good memories. The chicken was thin & tender while being well battered so that it is not just all batter. The ranch dressing was AMAZING for some reason... it could be because i haven't had any in a while... or theirs is just dericious.

SWEET POTATO FRIES - we got it w/ their truffle rosemary oil tossed into it & a little extra crispy & it was so so so DERICIOUS!! These fries were DEVOURED & being fought for!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good burgers for a fast food chain. The sin city burger was bomb, great burger on a fresh egg bun and the smash fries were really good too. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Smash burger is the perfect place to chill with your friends if you just want to quick bite to eat. You get to eat the good mood a short amount of time without the fast food feel and you still get the nice homemade taste. The only downside to Smashburger is that the burgers are overpriced at nearly 6 dollars for a single patty. I recommend for a quick bite or to hang out after school."}
{"text":"Burgers are reasonably priced and very good. The Smash fries are good with the oil. The staff was friendly but not attentive. I ordered a shake after my meal but never received it. I had to go back to the counter with my receipt and the staff told me they were sorry and brought it to my table."}
{"text":"My first time at Smashburger and it was a positive experience.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and my Mushroom Swiss Smash was flavorful and juicy.  I made the mistake of ordering large Smash Fries to share and they were a bit oily and seemed completely unnecessary since we ordered shakes too; that was the only part of our meal we didn't finish.  The Oreo and Peanut Butter Chocolate shakes were delicious but a bit small considering their price of $4.29."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy burgers!!! I decided to go all out and get the western burger with BBQ sauce (my fav at at most places!) and the smash fries.  Neither disappointed!!  The burger was so delicious and the fries were excellent! Staff was friendly and the environment was clean.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Rex needs to put a disclaimer on this review...I am fresh out of forced temporary housing...which explains why Rex hasn't written in a while.  The circumstances are really quite simple. Rex believes that what a man does in someone else's dumpster is his own business.  Picture this...Rex goes to his favorite \"single wide\" (dumpster to the uninformed) and finds...and you won't believe this...trash in it. Philistines! So Rex removed it. He sits down with a can of happy juice (ammonia, gasoline (leaded), two moth balls, three mentos, a tic tac and 6 toe nail clippings that have been buried in the desert for 2 weeks) and a 3 year old copy of \"Giant White Butts\"...like most men do on a Thursday...Tuesday...some night. Whatever. Well, suddenly after half a bottle of happy juice rex saw 3 blue men. They yelled. They grabbed at Rex. Next...what happens...is not totally clear...but ALLEDGEDLY...a naked Rex (a beautiful sight)...holding a top hat and stapler jumped out past the blue men and ran down the street straight into a wall. The wall stopped Rex's run. Rex awoke to a single padded room against his will. 

The first thing Rex needs outside of lock up is food.  After a ride from 4 kids out on a joy ride Rex found himself in front of Smashburger.  This was not the first time Rex has sauntered...sashayed...glided into Smashburger. Rex will tell you the first time he went, the second time and the third time he was underwhelmed.  Decent food, expensive food, not Rex's idea of a value.

Today was Rex's fourth time. Was it different? Did he like it? Was he allowed to leave after screaming \"This is the kind of place that the Nazi's would have opened if they won the war!\"?  The answer to all of these is...no. Not at all.

Where to begin...wherever to begin?  The first thing Rex tried was the namesake of his town. The Sin City Burger. A good burger, and honestly, the best burger on their menu...when done right. They put a fried egg on top and if the fried egg is cooked too hard and the yolk doesn't come out...the burger isn't the same. Two burgers. Two different cooked eggs. The yolk makes a bit of  a sauce, and much needed sauce.  The Spicy Baja is just not spicy. Sorry. Rex understands the underdeveloped palate, and my favorite HO Third Eye Sally has half a tongue and isn't medically allowed to eat spicy food because of medical conditions...didn't find it spicy. The Mushroom Swiss burger has mayo on it when a better sauce would really make the burger.  Chicken sandwich you ask?  They have them. They are hit and miss. The Buffalo, miss...because the sauce isn't good. The BBQ ranch, miss...because BBQ isn't good. The Avocado Club, hit. 

What about the fries? The hallmark of any good burger joint...well...hit and miss again. Just like when Rex is asked to hit her belly...(but Rex misses on purpose).  Two times Rex went he got the regular fries. Two times the Smashfries. The Smashfries the first time were great. The second time the rosemary and garlic seemed liked it was burned. It has a bitter taste. The regular fries were just that, regular.  Third Eye let me have some of her Chili Cheese Fries and they are pretty good. The best of the bunch.

The bottom line is that this not a great burger place because the quality control isn't good. This is the type of food that needs to be done right. Sadly, it isn't. Somehow in the 200+ times Rex has eaten at In And Out he has never had a bad meal. One 1 out of 4 times did Rex have a good meal at Smashburger. Oh, and if you complain...no one cares. Just like when you complain to Rex. Only difference is you complain to a person at Smashburger...you complain to the memories of Rex. Rex never sees your tears...only your sister naked."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Dirty tables. All of them. The smash fries are so good I ate here anyway, but this place needs to clean up. I can see two employees doing nothing."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst hamburger I've ever had.  Hamburger looked and tasted like a piece of cardboard.  I cannot understand how anyone could like this food."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that I was a vegetarian for a long, long time, and even went down the vegan path a time or two.  A roadtrip through Texas destroyed that, however.  Now, I'm back on the meat wagon.  Why does that sound more perverse than I mean it to?  Anyway, this burger joint makes my conversion to the dark side complete.  My partner and I have gone there on several occasions, and it's all been consistently decadent.  Yes, the hamburgers are a bit salty, but isn't that the point?  Aren't you supposed to have a greasy burger after a night of fun?

I've had a number of items on their menu--from the fried pickles to the haystack onions to one of their delicious shakes--and nothing has disappointed.  Everything's been made exactly like I'd want it to be and nothing has failed to delight.  Sure, you don't want to eat here every day.  It's meant as a sinful treat, like on your cheat day during your regular healthy eating schedule.  I'd stay on the meat wagon, just to have one of their delicious burgers on an egg bun with sharp cheddar cheese any day!"}
{"text":"The service is atrocious here! Food is on par with any other smashburger. My total was 10.25 and I gave the cashier 20.25. She gave me nine dollars back as change. I let her know that my change should be ten dollars. Instead of just simply fixing the problem and handing me a dollar back, she refused to help me and told me I was wrong. A manager had to come out to help her and let her know she did in fact owe me a dollar. The dollar isn't the problem; it is the fact that employees are allowed to argue with customers. Hopefully smashburger is able to provide their cashiers with a calculator at this location for the future."}
{"text":"Troy Balko is very diligent worker, he prides himself on giving you the best possible service. The only negative thing I saw with his service was when I brought my 2 children he repeatedly said they smell like bean and cheese burritos which appalled me. Other than that he was great! :)"}
{"text":"This is an update on our most recent visit to this store...... When we arrived one of the counter people stepped up to register as if he were ready to take my order. I started to give him my order and he appeared to be staring off into the room. I tried again and the same thing..... On the next try, having had enough of his apparent neglect, I started with \"Concentrate on the customer\". He responded with \"I was listening to him\" (meaning the other counter person. At that point he took our order and promptly delivered it to our table. If not for the incident at the register of his apparent lack of customer care I would continue with my previous rating of 4.5 stars."}

How's that for simple?"}
{"text":"Fries are good. The seating is narrow and cramped.  Don't bring a large group.  You won't have room to eat. The seats are almost upright and uncomfortable to sit in for more than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Great burger but the sweet potato fries are out of sight! Not far from where I work so it is becoming a regular stop."}
{"text":"This is by far the best location! Always extremely clean and the food always comes out perfect. Jared, Mike and Trenton are extremely helpful and have the best costumer service around. I live closer to Desert Ridge but find myself making the drive here because of how friendly everyone is."}
{"text":"I have to qualify this review by say that I have only ever had the Sin City burger from smashburger.  That being said, the Sin City is hands down the BEST chain burger I have ever eaten!!  I recently took my friend to smashburger and asked him to rate his all-time favorite burgers.  he said it was close between the squeeze inn's squeeze with cheese and smash's Sin City, but the Sin City was his winner.  When I am craving a burger, the Sin City is my go to burger.  

The smash fries with the olive oil, garlic, and rosemary are a great accompaniment to the Sin City burger.  I love that hint of rosemary that comes through.  Makes the fries so fragrant and flavorful."}
{"text":"I really like the sin city burger. That's the only burger I've had and it's so so so good. Could quite possibly be my favorite nominally priced burger. I've heard the mushroom burger is tasty as well, but everyone I tell myself to try something different, I'm drawn to the sin city. Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food was great, however we ordered 4 malts and they were rung up wrong as shakes so the prices were wrong.  Then our food was out in less than 10 minutes which was nice...but...those malts were out 30 minutes later, we were done with our dinner and were still waiting for our drinks.  This is ridiculous!! Never have had such poor service in a fast food restaurant.  The people working there acted like they hate their job.  So disheartening not to mention damn expensive for a poor experience.  Never again will i go there, i will stick to my regular smashburger in happy valley since they are always good."}
{"text":"I love smash burger, but this one sucks. The service is good, but the food is bad. It's pointless to order smash fries (which I normally love) they are just extra greasy normal fries and they barely add any herbs. This location also rips you off on toppings. If you don't order extra sauce you end up with a dry burger. Personally, I will just drive a little further to a different smash burger."}
{"text":"Having the quarter lb burger w/spinach, tomatoe, onion, goat cheese crumbles, and cucumbers w/vinaigrette on a multigrain bun.  I should've gone for the 1/2 lb....SO GOOD! I would have posted a picture, but I ate it in record time.  ;)"}
{"text":"Trendy burgers by committee. This place has potential were it not born in a corporate boardroom. The burgers are decent, and the side choices are not the run of the mill fries or onion rings. We had fried pickles and sweet potato fries. It can get a little pricey depending on what you order. I wish I had realized they serve beer but good to know for future reference.
The mood was really mellow in the dining room, which is not really what you'd expect from a place that has a giant red \"smash\" painted on the wall. The music was way too low key. And at least two of the cashier/servers were chewing gum while working. Personal pet peeve. 
If smashburger turned up the attitude just a little, and made it a little more of a hang out, the overall experience would be much better."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Smashburger but today I was so disappointed. I ordered a baja Cobb salad. Most boring salad o have ever had. Not because of the lack of toppings. It comes with guacamole, jalapenos, tomatoes, onions and cheese. But I kid you not they literally put a tiny pinch of everything. I payed $6 for a bowl of lettuce..and what's worst is I bought two..lol I could have went to Smith's and bought the boxed lettuce for cheaper!"}
{"text":"I came here because I hear that this is one the best places to get a burger. They have a variety of burger to choose from and the employees are awesome and patient while you try to decide on what you want to eat bi got the special fries which was awesome but my burger on the other hand looked like it was paper thin and it was very dry. Not too much flavor on it either. I was quiet disappointed in it and I don't think I will be back to try another burger. I guess I just expected more from a burger joint"}
{"text":"The only thing this smashburger has going for it is that it doesn't have flies like the other location in Tempe marketplace. However, every time we come in here, the girl taking orders is completely rude, and ignores us until she can't anymore. I don't know why it's hard to acknowledge a customer's existence in your store? The tables are almost all dirty at all times of the day, I've never seen them wipe them down and I come here quite often. The cooks obviously play music, which would be fine, if you couldn't hear their screamo over the music playing in the dining room. Very unprofessional to hear T-Pain playing in the kitchen.  Overall, this smashburger location has rude cashiers, dirty tables, booths and floors, and almost always has their rewards thing down so I can't even use it. I would rather drive to norterra from Scottsdale for smash because every location in the east valley is atrocious."}
{"text":"Just tried Smashburger for the first time, and was not disappointed.  I consider myself a bit of a burger aficionado, so I ordered the restaurant's signature burger and fries.  In the LV region, it's the Sin City burger and Smashfries.  Both were delicious.  However, the menu is much much larger, offering chicken burgers, hot dogs, and shakes, which I've yet to try, and expect to review in the future.  If there was a Shake Shack Burger in the West, Smashburger would be its close cousin.

Sin City Burger:
-designed for carnivores (as it doesn't come with any lettuce or tomatoes)
-beef patty is meaty, flattened, and has a wider circumference than the rest of the burger, so you take more time eating and enjoying it.
-fried egg and caramelized onions complement each other, and the yolk adds to the savoriness.
-egg bun provides a hint of sweetness
-a bit oily, as it was evident that oil was dripping from my fingers.  does not diminish flavor and experience of the burger.

Smashfries:
-crispy
-rosemary and garlic seasoning is superb

Prices tend to be a little higher, as the burgers are fancier than fast food joints.  However, I used a BOGO coupon acquired from playing the burger smasher game on http://smashburgerburgersmasher.com/, which made it super affordable.  Would go again if I get another deal like this."}
{"text":"Decided to give Smashburger a try after hearing about it from several people. It was very quiet and clean. The burger was good but nothing to brag about, fries were hot and ordinary. I guess I was hoping for something better. I probably won't be back, closer burger places nearby"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch yesterday (Tuesday), about 2:30 pm; place was empty.  Now I know to come late. Had a BYGO coupon so we got a free burger. Both our burgers were very flavorful; I prefer the taste of the Smashburgers to other burger chains; a bit salty, but good. Tried the onion straw side for the first time and liked them a lot. 

For now Smashburger is my burger of choice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town for our anniversary getaway. So after seeing an excellent show we both decided to go to a drive thru to get food for dinner so it'll be faster and we can have it in our hotel. We agreed on going to Smashburger to try it out since we've never been to one. Although the cashier was very nice, I cannot say the same about the food that we got. 

With the price we paid for, we were given food that wasn't our order. We ordered Avocado Club Beef and Smashburger beef with salad and we both got Bacon Cheeseburger and salad. I'm surely don't think it was a mixed up because we were the only one waiting in the drive thru.

The worst part is that my boyfriend ended up getting food poisoning. Surely it came from what he ate from that place because some of it came out when he was throwing up early this morning. 

We will not be going to this place at all and will not refer it to anyone."}
{"text":"WOW that burger was awesome!!! $20 for two and the smash fries made it so worth it. I really enjoyed the club burger. It was so big I almost couldn't finish it. Yummy food and soft ambiance. You rocked it."}
{"text":"What a great fast food burger. I had the Arizona.  Little more pricey than you'd think but the shakes here are delicious. Never understood why they give you the giant extra metal cup with the rest of your shake in it, when they could just give you your shake in bigger glass. Either way I'll be back."}
{"text":"Burger were super good and they are very customizable. I really enjoyed eating here. I wouldn't go here too often since I think the burgers are a little pricey. 

The fries were good, but they are pretty thin. I prefer thicker fries but they weren't bad at all. Before you go here always heck online for coupons. They always have coupons. My wife and I had buy $5 get, $2 off. It is impossible to spend less than $5 here. So we just ended up ordering separately to get more money off. 

Service was great and fast. I would definitely recommend this place if you are a burger lover!"}
{"text":"Ordered salad with goat cheese; sun flowers and etc plus grilled chicken.  The grilled chicken was too salty.  Sweet potato fries were awesome."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Smashburger and because of the manager Beven, our experience was absolutely outstanding. This was one of the best service experiences we've had in a long time. The burgers were mouth watering good. I got mine with goat cheese, tomato, mushrooms, grilled onions and chipotle mayo and my partner got the bbq burger option (i forgot the name, but it had bbq, onions, ched chz, etc.) We were both super impressed with the taste and freshness of our burgers. We also got those sweet potato/smashburger fries which were delicious. We will definitely be visiting this location again and are Smashburger lovers for life!"}
{"text":"Never got past the greeting. \"I'll be right with you she said.\"  Proceeded to turn her back to us and do assorted other tasks.  Some prep for other orders, some looked more like busy work. We ended up leaving during her inattention.  This is twice this has happened at this location.  In my experience this is not representative of SmashBurger, but seems to be the norm at this particular site.   

I would recommend a pass."}
{"text":"I just love this place! I was so accustomed to ordering the Arizona burger until I figured the Smashchicken would be a lower calorie choice. Boy am I glad I tried something new, the sandwich was AMAZING. Smashburger can do no wrong in my eyes...knock on wood :-) also just a little tip, try the Nutter Butter shake...it's ridiculous"}
{"text":"This is a new location that is so conveniently located right next to where I work.  I have been here several times in the last month and the one word that comes to mind is \"inconsistent.\"  When they're on their A game, they produce the absolute best burger I have ever had.  I've been there a couple times when they haven't been on their A game and then they produce average burgers.  I love that they have the build-your-own smashburger option because I am a picky eater and I always have to custom order burgers.  They have tons of toppings that are included in the price and I have to commend them for using real kosher dill pickles on their burgers, not those awful thin plastic-y ones that most burger joints use.  The burgers are full of flavor, super juicy, and just fantastic when you get the right cook.  The only issue I had with my first burger was it was way too pink on the inside for me.  The next time I asked for it well done and it came almost exactly the same as the first one.  The next time I asked for it well done again and it came char broiled, like a brick.  (Hence the inconsistency.)  I had their mushroom swiss burger yesterday for the first time and I have to say it was the best mushroom swiss burger I have ever had.  Today I had the exact same burger and it didn't have the same flavor.

Their fries are always crispy, which I love, but they're a bit heavy on the salt.  I like salt and they are sometimes too much for me.

My mom was here a couple weeks ago and I took her there and she said she'd gain 20 lbs if there was a Smashburger near where she lives.  When they're on their A game they are a 5-star burger joint.  I just wish they were on their A game every day!"}
{"text":"Simple, satisfying and easy on the wallet, what's not to love about a well-cooked juicy slab of beef between two freshly baked buns? While some burgers are better than others, there usually isn't much to tell them apart.

Now comes Smashburger, the latest and certainly not the last, burger concept that distinguishes itself not by its number of fancy toppings, but by its cooking method.

Smashburger is located in Tempe, next to the ASU campus, where there is more eye candy than free parking. (There is a parking structure nearby with a $3 fee for the first hour.)

Smashburger's name pretty much says it all. The restaurant takes 100 percent ground Angus beef and, using a spatula, literally smashes it onto the cook top. The idea is to quickly sear the meat so that the juices are sealed inside the burger.

I was skeptical of the cooking method since smashing a burger forces juices out during cooking, causing a dry burger. But the staff was all smiles, friendly and showing a genuine eagerness to help.

After only a few bites of my half-pound Classic Smashburger ($5.99), I was convinced that their cooking method is sound -- it makes for a tasty burger. Hanging over the edges of the bun, the meat did remain juicy, with that slightly salty beefiness that I know and love.

If you're really hungry, you can add another half-pound patty for $3. Now that's a burger!

Smashfries ($1.79 when ordered with a sandwich), tossed with olive oil, garlic and rosemary, were an instant hit. The Haystack Onions were limp and too salty.

Chicken sandwiches, salads and hot dogs are also on he menu.

The Arizona Devil Dog ($3.99) is a Hebrew National 100 percent beef hot dog slathered with spicy guacamole, habanero cheese, jalapenos and onions on a toasted poppy-seed bun. Oh, the burn!

To cool things off, Smashburger makes Häagen-Dazs milkshakes ($3.99) in four flavors -- vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cactus vanilla (prickly pear). The shakes are rich, creamy and decadent.

Being a fast-casual restaurant, customers order at the counter, then find a seat. In a short while, someone will bring out your grub.

The smallish dining space is modern in an accessible chain store kind of way. Be warned, there are no public restrooms in this store, so be sure to bring your own hand sanitizer.

So, contrary to popular belief, smashing is actually, well, quite smashing."}
{"text":"a few sundays ago we always go to pink doughnuts because they are phenomenal and smashburger just happens to be in the area. Ive had it before and on a food only review this gets a 2.5 stars even though we walked out. So there is a soccer park next to this location and it was busy. The hostess/cashier at the front took our order didnt really say a word about the wait. 30 mins later as i see togo customers packing their own orders in the bags I knew it was busy. Meanwhile my wife is getting stressed because we have somewhere to be. there were about 6 parties that sat down after us and all of the orders came up. 38 minutes in; the food finally pops up. I can read the order window and all the togo food is done after priority of the people sitting in. Not a problem if i was told it would be 45 mins. Meanwhile i confront the hostess if i can get my food because she is knee deep in the weeds. she says no ill do it when im ready. i reply its been 40 mins. she says well im not working in the back its not my fault. being a business owner i understand customer service and i know for a fact the customer is always right even if i tell you its blue and the damn color is red. So i reply are you arguing with me. Which she then says no im just saying its not my fault.  So needless to say we walked out and said we wont be back."}
{"text":"So we were in Phoenix last week with our 14s vball club and they decided they wanted to eat SmashBurger. I know they have one here in SD, but it never really grabbed my attention much. I was really excited to eat there. 

We arrived with about 15+ people and the service was great. The guy \"KIRBY\" at the cash register was quick and new pretty much all the answers to the questions everyone asked. 

I had the BUILD YOUR OWN... Chicken burger. I made a mistake of getting 2 sauces on one burger but that is not why they only got 3 stars. 

I gave them 3 stars because I guess I expected more. I didn't get a burger but when I seen the burgers that were being served I'm glad I got my chicken. The patties were really skinny (not plump and juicy) ... maybe thats why they are called smash burger, because the burger literally looked like it was smashed to its thinnest life span. 

But I would go back and try their burgers, but it was just OK for me.... If the second time around I go and its just \"OK\"... I probably would just stick to IN & OUT or Burger Lounge!

:) Happy smashing..."}
{"text":"Ordered gluten free bun. They put onion straws on burger - loaded with gluten. My fault as it was actually listed on the menu - BUT, seems someone should have asked. BBQ Burger came with no BBQ Sauce. Had them remake it. Ordered shakes. They ran out of milk & had to go to a store so they could make them. Mixed up the order. They don't have it together. Excuse was that there is a new cook. Time to fix it. Food was actually pretty good. I was going to give them a 1 but they sort of recovered."}
{"text":"They have gluten-free buns, and their Burgers and chicken are all the Yums! You can get goat cheese on your burger, my favorite! I love their shoestring fries... They're not too soggy and not too overly crispy, just right! 

They have four salads and they all sound good, but I'm not here to be *that* healthy."}
{"text":"Food - 4/5
Burgers and chicken sandwiches are both delicious. Smash fries are great, love the chili cheese fries.

Service - 4/5
Always good service, food is fast.

Atmosphere - 3/5
nothing special, fast food can be REALLY busy and packed with people.

Price - 3/5
Average I can't really complain, you'll spend around $10 for a burger fries and a drink.

Overall - Quality burger, certainly not \"Disgusting!!\" or \"GREASY\" like other 1 star wonders have rated it, If you like burgers worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Kind of pricey, but the quality tastes better than some of their competitors. The sweet potato fries are so delicious! The entire staff has always been friendly, helpful, and fast."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and they've always had really great food.

Today I was really disappointed though. I went in to order to-go and I got a Classic Chicken Sandwich. I got it protein style with avocados. Every protein style burger I've ever had always wraps the lettuce around the burger so you can actually eat it. The chicken was just covered with leaf lettuce and it was extremely hard to eat.

I paid $1 for the avocado and there was barely 2 slices in my \"sandwich\" and they were kinda browning.

The staff was great and the food is usually great too. Just not this time. I don't suggest ordering anything protein style there. You may as well get a salad, you'll probably get your money's worth if you do."}
{"text":"As most already report this fast food burger joint is quite expensive but it is located at Caesar's Food Court.  No combo meals offered here, everything is ala carte. Almost $20.00 for burger, fries and soda, $4.49 for the soft drink LOL! The burger and fries were good. Girl taking the orders was so miserable she really needs to find another job. Place is open til 4:30am on Friday and Saturday but only til 11:00pm Mon-Thu. which is a huge negative too."}
{"text":"Went to check the hype about smash burger. Wasn't pleased with what came out. Food was just loaded with grease. I ordered the sin city burger and it was just dripping in grease.  Smash fries tasted stale. The avocado on the black bean burger was black more than anything. Had to send it back. What struck me odd was the manager was standing right there expediting the food. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Ordered the Spinach & Goat Cheese Salad w/Chicken...The Chicken seemd very greesy! You have your choice of either grilled or crispy chicken...I chose grilled...Funny, I didn't see an option of 'Greesy Chicken\" as one of the choices! (...Being scarcastic). I wanted no raisins in it, but they told me I would have get no nut-mix at all since raisins come in a mix with pumpkin seeds & dried cranberries, so I did that. I also ordered their Smash Fries, which were on the cold side...I should have returned them for a hot order, on top of that, they were very greesy as well, & just not to fresh to me. I probably should have gotten the Sweet Potato Fries which are better tasting, but I thought I'd try these.  Also, Their back door was open and it seemed like someone was smoking outside & the cigerette smoke was coming in to the restaurant! ...I was not happy about that. Also, someone was wearing a lot of cologne near by...Ugh!  I don't think I will want to eat here again... IN-N-OUT is much better & less expensive. ...Perhaps a Salad is NOT the thing to order here, I once had a Chicken Sandwich here & that was pretty good, maybe just stick to that in the future, IF I come back here again.  :)"}
{"text":"Very enthusiastic employees, great service. I appreciate Smashburger for having gluten free buns. Their personal Smashburger ketchup isn't great, definitely not Heinz."}
{"text":"I had an issue with my food, but the store manager was awesome in getting it corrected.  The staff was polite, friendly and very professional.  Thank you for the service."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't expect much from fast food burger joints but this was great. My friend had the classic smash dressed up according to Rob the manager's recommendation. He devoured it within minutes - I had the buffalo blue cheese with smash tots and it was awesome. For sure will be back to check out the rest of the menu. Make sure you ask for Rob and ask him for what he recommends."}
{"text":"Great food!!  The staff is very friendly!  Clean restaurant. I would recommend the buffalo chicken sandwich, so good!!  Love their fries too"}
{"text":"Smashburger was good but I'm still searching for the justification of why 2 burgers, an order of garlic truffle fries and 2 sodas costs $32. I could eat at Red Robin for less and its not even a fast food joint. I literally felt like I was eating at an overpriced Sonic or Checkers. The cashier was nice but I still can't forgive myself for spending that much in desperation because of hunger and my unwillingness to go someone cheaper. I already had to meet my club tour group in Caesar's Palace so it didn't make any sense to leave. I learned my lesson. Never again."}
{"text":"I've been to the other SmashBurger on Lake Mead, this one seems to be larger.

I got the SmashChicken with the SmashFries and it was just the right amount of food.

For those watching their calories: On LiveStrong.com, the SmashBurger is 1010 calories!   However the SmashChicken is only 380 calories.  SmashFries are 150 calories.

This place was surprisingly fast, as we got there right before lunch.

The restaurant was very clean, the employees were very nice and checked up on us multiple times during our visit.

For a tip, if you're racing people to the register, remember to run for the door facing the West (Fort Apache) or else you'll be stuck in the maze of tables and lose! :)

This one is going on my work lunch rotation list!"}
{"text":"This place isn't as crowded as the location on Sahara and Fort Apache.  The food is just as good, closer to my work and the employees seem even more friendly than the aforementioned store (if that is even possible).

I order the Sin City Chicken and Rosemary Smash fries. It is very delicious.  The food is a little on the greasy side if your in the mood for something light, so keep that in mind. 

I love the plethora of seating and cleanliness that abounds. 

Diet Coke and Cherry Coke are available. 

This place is a winner for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice, & never again. Both times were at off hours (2-3:30 pm) Both times several dirty tables, dirty floor, slow service. Instead of taking a break, why not clean something?! Place must have no manager, or a bad manager. Stay away from this one!"}
{"text":"Had a burger here with jalipino.  The burger was meh.  They sliced LARGE jalip[inos and threw many slices on the burger.  I like to taste the food first, then go for the hot at the end as a sort of \"palette cleanse\", because after the hot hits, you taste nothing else.    After the mediocre burger taste, I then tried a slice of large fresh jalipino, with the seeds, it was about 3 inches across the slice alone and a cm thick..  My whole face proceeded to light on fire.  I went into hiccup frenzies as my eyes watered.   For the next 20 minutes I was at the drink counter grabbing ice.  the ice cubes melted as soon as theyh touched my mouth.    I guess the big jalipinos are more deadly than the small ones, as I can eat small slices no problems, with seeds etc.  And of course if they are candied or pickled, I can eat them by the handful."}
{"text":"They still couldn't get it right!  Ordered three burgers $36 I think a little expensive. But I ordered a double with cheese with tomato lettuce and avocado.  But I got a single with onions no cheese. Sure anyone can make a mistake. After waiting a long time for the staff to attend me, I noticed how dirty the floors were and just a general dirty grime to the place. So they made the burger again. Got a double but plain. No avocado or anything. I give up. They staff seemed like they were in outer space. I'll never be back. If you go, order in and make sure they serve it open face."}
{"text":"I went at this location with my family for Fathers Day.I had a Sin City Burger with sweet potato fries, my wife had an Mushroom Angus burger and my kids had chicken strips with normal fries.
First thing we noticed when the food came out was the disgusting oil leaking out from the burgers but we still give it a try.That was bad decision after 30min into our meal my wife and daughter had to run to the restroom (I guess I don't need to explain why). My sons chicken strips where all dry looked more like beef jerky then fresh chicken.Few hours after the meal my day took a bad turn too and I couldn't leave the house as I needed to be in a very close range from the bathroom.

There is NO way in the world I would take my family to one of their locations ever again."}
{"text":"Went here last night and got their 10th anniversary special burger- was soggy and very very greasy. The grease overpowered any flavors on the burger. I ordered smash fries and sweet potato fries. They were out of sweet potato fries so I got their veggie frites which the girl said was fried and came with ranch. Well these are literally carrot sticks and green beans fried with no breading on them and no seasoning at all- no salt or pepper. These were not good. I definitely won't be back. This place is overpriced and not good quality."}
{"text":"Two words - Smash Fries! Oh, and If you have not been recently, the new Brussels sprouts are to die for!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service tho.... I'm impressed!!
Excellent guest service! It's fast casual but you tell the staff is trained well. Manager in the window and walking the floor. You don't see that at other fast casuals. I was just coming in for a quick bite and have to say I felt welcomed. The register gent was a pleasure to deal with. I forgot my wallet and offered to get my meal started while I went to my car to get my wallet. Very polite and pleasant! You guys got my attention"}
{"text":"Dropped by Smashburger for a quick lunch on a weekend. There was a short line when I entered around 1:00 pm, but nothing too crazy. I ended up grabbing the Arizona burger, with a black bean patty, and the smash tots. The burger, which had guacamole, jalapenos, and chipotle mayo, was pretty delicious minus the over-salted patty itself. It was a bit hard to enjoy the flavors since the salt overwhelmed so much it. Towards, the end I honestly ended up brushing off excess salt off of the patty in order to finish eating it. The smash tots which had garlic, rosemary, and oil on them, were super yummy, but the portion seemed a biiit small for the price. 

Overall, service was great, but the saltiness of my burger makes me hesitate a bit about coming back here. Smash tots and the french fries do call out to me though. I say drop by if you're in the area and really craving a specific burger or side or if you have a coupon. If not, I would highly recommend checking out a different burger place for your fix."}
{"text":"Smash burger was an afternoon delight ! So fresh so juicy so delicious. This particular location was very very busy ! The line was long with 2 cashiers running the show, the seemed to be pretty fast and very friendly.  They cranked out the orders with errors on our take out which was a pleasant surprise.  

Not pricey very average & reasonable 
$6-7 range 

They have a great variety of burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, regular fries, smash fries ( Rosemary & sea salt ) hand spun Häagen-Dazs ice cream, and a few craft beers.  They use egg buns which are fluffy & soft. 

It's a good size burger not huge not tiny just right sounds like a burger fit for goldilocks ! 

Their beliefs 
WE BELIEVE IN FRESH, WHOLESOME, & AUTHENTIC INGREDIENTS LIKE FRESH, NEVER FROZEN CERTIFIED ANGUS BEEF®

I'm always down to try a new burger 
So when in the mood for a fresh juicy burger give Smash a try you won't be disappointed. 

I have to give 3 stars for the long line and messy fountain station & bathroom no TP is no cool.

Scale 1-10 for tastiness I'm going with a 8 

Happy Yelping"}
{"text":"4 stars for the sweet potato fries. Crispy and plentiful with just the right amount of salt.
The black bean burger not so great. Although for 6 bucks, I had to eat the whole thing. I opted to leave out the ranch sauce. The patty itself was large but just mushy. No texture at all. I eat only veggie or non meat burgers and this is by far the least exciting black bean burger I've ever had.
Along with the sad piece of lettuce, 2 paper thin slices of semi green tomatoes, and a pitiful piece of avocado, this version of a black bean burger should be smashed to the compost bin."}
{"text":"Sadly this place has gone way down. The burger is so salty I can barely eat half. Tried the  crunchy chicken today and it was way over cooked. Very dry and almost burnt. I had it to go or I would  have gotten a new one. Stay away.  Shake was good. Death of smash Burger is coming soon."}
{"text":"This smash burger location on lake mead and Buffalo is in deplorable shape. We placed an order online so getting our food wasn't the issue. We sat and waited for our shake, and during that time, what we saw made us never want to come to this chain again. First of all, customers were in line waiting 45 minutes just to get their order taken. And they were in the front of the line! Everyone else had walked out, so I'm surprised they stood around. Next, they obviously don't drug test seeing as the woman making shakes was obviously on meth. She was so busy making shakes she wasn't taking orders. And the guy standing next to her was doing just that. Standing. Just standing around. The orders weren't getting cleared out so the cooks had to come out and clear them out themselves. Wallpaper was peeling off the wall. There were boxes of trash stacked up in the kitchen, and there were fries all over the floor. They either pay their employees very poorly here, or they just flat out don't have a manager. They need someone there delegating everything. This was truly shocking. I have been to this location when they first opened and it wasn't like this. It's gone way downhill. Never ever again will we return. 

Edit*** Id like to add, the \"hand spun\" milkshake was absolutely disgusting. I can't believe a major chain is selling this garbage. It tasted like watery milk and cigarettes. Yeah, my butterfinger milkshake had a taste of cigarettes. Thank you Smashburger."}
{"text":"Our first encounter with Smashburger was for a friend's birthday party. At the time, my son had yet to outgrow his milk protein and soy protein intolerance/allergy. Which makes eating out something of a challenge for us. Fortunately, Smashburger has an extensive and informative food allergy menu/guide on their website, and the create your own option allows me to easily get a burger free of allergens to share with my son. 

The food here is really good too. We love their burgers, and the Smash fries. I was sad to learn though that it's not just seasonings and olive oil on the fries though. Their website indicates that there is soy in the seasoning, and my son did have a slight reaction after eating them."}
{"text":"It isn't often that I can say I have no complaints about anything on a menu but so far everything I've tried is yummy and delicious.  The mushroom swiss burger with smash fries is my favorite meal.  Customer service is always great and extra points for giving a military discount."}
{"text":"My latest experience with this restaurant wasn't great.  

I had called in my order via phone, and was hoping for it to be ready as soon as I arrived.  Unfortunately, the food was not ready (or so I was told) when I arrived, so I had a seat to wait for it to be completed.  While I was waiting, I noticed that underneath the heat warming lamps were a few bags of food however, and I assumed this was for a different individual.  Anyways, as time passed and I waited, the store employees were all banded together talking.  Finally, after about ten minutes, I decided to ask if the food under the lamp was mine, and sure enough it was.  This pissed me off, and on top of all that, the burger was burnt & cold. 

I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I love SmashBurger! Everything I have ever had there has been amazing, especially their shakes! And its nice to have one so close to the house :)"}
{"text":"I feel bad for the poor trainee at the register who was abandoned by her managers. First off, we had to tell the \"manager\" about their own specials. Nothing like a customer knowing more than management. The trainee at the register tried her best to ring in a fairly simple order. She was having issues, and her \"manager\" was nowhere to be found. I finally had her get him. I verified the girl was in training and proceeded to let him know she tried her best, but they should have been shadowing her. He just stared at me like a deer caught in the headlights. There was nobody in line, two other customers in the restaurant, and one car in the drive through. Management is failing their employees at this store."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.

I've heard my co-workers raving about this place and this just doesn't compare to any of the raved \"gourmet\" burgers I've had. Not In'N'out, and definitely not Shake Shack quality.

The patty was meh. Where is all the juice?
The traditional egg bun is interesting, but not roasted. A $5 burger should have their buns ROASTED.
The smash sauce is gross.

Just don't go there for their burgers."}
{"text":"It's a good option at the Phoenix airport, their fries are really good.

I don't know if I'd go to any other branch, just good for the airport."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Whether you're getting a chicken sandwich or a classic smashburger you won't be disappointed! Even when we've gone here during busy times at lunch or dinner the service and food are always outstanding!"}
{"text":"This location has to be the slowest of the entire chain. I have made the mistake more than once trying this location again. I have tried to order online but still 20-25 minute wait from scheduled pick up time. Today at lunch they had one person for counter help and the line out the door."}
{"text":"Another overpriced and average tasting burger place... so what.

This is why I make my own burgers... or if I must go out for a burger (like when a friend insists) we go to Fudruckers."}
{"text":"So fast and delicious. The staff was super friendly. Lyrical took great care of us and got our order up fast. They met or dietary needs with lettuce wrapping my burger. Kids enjoyed the chicken strips and giant Oreo shakes too. 
We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Smashburger from my friends. I eventually stopped by to try the place out.
First of all, the service was great. Super friendly staff and quick service. The plating of the food was simple yet appealing. Everything was pretty awesome, but the food itself? I had the Baja Burger and it was bland. A stark contrast to my expectations that had been building up. 
I may come back and try a different burger, but Smashburger left a pretty disappointing first impression."}
{"text":"Staff is awesome. Food is yummy. My kids love smashburger.  I prefer some other places, but their food is still tasty."}
{"text":"I was excited that I could preorder online and pay when I arrived. I ordered and arrived just under 10 minutes later. However, after waiting for 15 more minutes for my to go order that had been left sitting under the heat lamp, the excitement fled. After a 5 minute ride home we ate lukewarm burgers and fries. Pretty bummed."}
{"text":"Good food, clean, with a friendly helpful staff.  Price seems a little high for the caliber of food.  Would give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Finally got in to Smash, looked like good beer selection although I had the 1/3 lb classic and the vegetable fries (carrots and broccoli spears)...the fries were small portion and the burger was kind of small but it was super tasty and the decor is cute, kind of like 50's style diner booth. i got mine to go and also like the other reviews, the wax box is nice, no mess and there was salad dressing in a seperate container i guess for the fries but they were sort of oily fried so i ate without...i liked the burger alot! ill def go back, they have larger burgers 1/4 lb and also chicken breast burgers, some with avacado or habernero peppers etc"}
{"text":"Brought my husband for the first time! Matt was supe helpful wi th recommendations and service! Had the smashed grilled chicken - fabulous!  My husband had the BBQ Bacon Cheddar buger, loved it! Gotta try the Buffalo fries - great football food! I like the veggie fries (carrots rock!) Must repeat, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite burger joints but today was disappointing. No complain about their burgers though it was the smash fries I noticed it's not as many as I used to order for a regular size plus there was so much oil in my fries and it tasted like it was old. My husband asked one of the servers if they had a new cook and they did. I would have given this place a 4 star I hope next time when I come back my fries will be as good as before."}
{"text":"This is one of the few hamburger places I eat at because the burgers are SO fresh.  I first tried this place from a Groupon and have been going back ever since.  They offer a discounted meal for UNLV students (id required) too. I like Smashburger over In and Out. The burgers here have substance. They have chicken options also. 

PROS:
Sin City burger- beef patty, smash sauce, bacon, fried onions and a fried egg on an egg bun.
Fried Pickles
French Fries (skinny like McDonalds)"}
{"text":"I finally went to my local Smashburger (The UNLV location) and boy oh boy!  I was impressed!  That was one of the tastiest burgers I have had in years!  I got the Sin City burger, substituted American cheese for pepperjack.  Seriously juicy and delicious.  Surprised at how much money two burgers and one order of Smashfries cost, but based on how good it was, I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best healthy burger I ever had   I would defenetley  will come back again good job most people don't know what it takes to run a restaurant and I think they are doing a great job excellent customer service.  Loved it"}
{"text":"Always the same and always delicious. It's clean, very friendly employees and quick!!"}
{"text":"Well this place has gone to the dumps.  Tonight I had 2nd order of the week messed up.  All wrong and totally inedible.  It was take-out both times.  So first time I let it go - I know mistakes happen.  Tonight I called and asked for the manager.  She said too busy and would not take my call.  I said I was a customer with a messed up order and she again refused to take my call -she was  just yelling her answered at her poor  clerk who answered.   I work hard for my money and if they don't care about their business then they don't get my money.  Stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Been here a total of 3 times so far and I love the food! They have perfect cheese burgers for my husband, grilled cheese sandwhiches for the kids, and I always get the crispy chicken sandwhich with gluten free bun, spinach and goat cheese! They also have sweet potatoe fries that are delicious. there is never too many people in the place at one time so it's never crowded... You have the option of getting a soft drink or there's also organic tea available which is cool. There is an older black lady that normally works and is my favorite! she is so on top of everything it's unbelievable! I went to visit there yesterday and she wasn't there...  they forgot to put goat cheese on my burger, which I bet wouldn't happen if she had been there. They were very quick to fix it once I mentioned it so that was awesome. The best part about them is they have Haagen Daas Milk S"}
{"text":"Social-media inspired decision to stand in line on opening day for a free burger. Nice to see another option here in Montford Park and I enjoyed the meal, although they don't really seem to stand out from the crowd in a significant way. Burgers were tasty, fries crisp, and they certainly maximized their seating capacity in a small space. The service was positive and things actually moved relatively quickly considering the big wave of people looking to get in on a deal. Certainly worth checking out, but I worry that the Viva Chicken, while offering a distinctly different product, will overshadow their neighbor. Also, wish Shake Shack opening up a few steps away in Park Road Shopping Center, even nearby apartment dwellers will see competition."}
{"text":"Went here when we reached the hotel and it was the only thing still open which was a plus. Bad thing was that they were out of tator tots, bacon, it was about 6 things which left ordering a little limited but based on the time o guess it was expected l. Cashier was very friendly and food didn't take long at all. Food was pretty good I really wanted the sweet potato fries which they were out of."}
{"text":"Smashburger is one of those new upscale fastfood burger joints that have been popping up lately. Its in the same vein as Five Guys and the like. I don't really mind the food but to be honest, I can't leave the place and tell my self that it was worth the money I paid. 

Don't get me  wrong... the food is good, waaay better than the slop you get at mcdonalds, but keep in a mind that an average combo is around $11+. To me that approaches the same cost as a sit-down restaurant which this is not. Smashburger is celebrated and improved fast food but its still the same stuff. 

The restaurant itself is pretty minimal, big paint words like SMASH and BURGER all over the walls. The tables and seating area are better than would find at most burger places in town but this particular location is starting to look a little run down to me. Cracked seats, food under the table, - it needs maintenance.

You can't really complain about the burgers here though. They are big, taste good and are satisfying. They have enough options and add-ons to satisfy pretty much even the most pickiest of eaters. There are different buns, burger sizes, toppings, everything you could want. The ingredients are of great quality and the food is consistent. 

The fries on the other hand is a totally different story, I've had every incarnation of fries they have on their menu. The smash fries, regular fries, sweet potato friends, pickle fries and to me, they all suck. The regular fries I swear to god are the same thing at mcdonalds, the sweet potato fries look and taste like they have been fried 3x. The smash fries are a good idea if I can get them not sitting in a puddle of oil every time they are brought out, and the pickle fries (yes they are there) are good but not something any body would get regularly. 

Check the place out if you want a good burger, but its way over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Eh it's good I guess. I really wasn't a fan of the menu. And the prices weren't that appealing."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern. Today my family and I visited your lake pleasant and Happy Valley Location. I'm sad to have to be reporting that our dining experience was far below satisfactory. Let me begin by telling you the manner in which your \"Lead Brooke B\" presented herself in front of paying customers has left us with a sour feeling  in our stomachs and heavy hearts for the other 2 employees Sam and Jenn for having to report to such a person.

Our experience began after ordering we observed  Brooke tell Jenn (while Jenn was cutting paper we're assuming for trays) that she should pretend she was getting payed while at work and go actually work. You could see on Jenn's face she was mortified and holding back the tears. I went and grabbed the manager on duty and I apologize I didn't get his name. I told him what I heard and he said Brooke's just having a bad day and apologized on her behalf.. Okay being the understanding person that I am I get being in a serving  industry you have good an bad days, just like any one we human. But to my dismay Brooke's lack of professionalism didn't end there.

Brooke had asked Sam to hurry it up with the shakes that making shakes wasn't rocket science. Moments later Brooke asked Jenn to go outside to clean the tables. Jenn cleaned 2 but one family was still eating. I witnessed her taking the food they were done with and went back to the register as the line was getting pretty backed up...

When Brooke noticed the out side dining area was still dirty, Brooke grabbed the manager and said I can't believe her (Jenn) if I could I swear I'd smack the shit out of her..

Then walked to Jenn and pulled her mid sentence helping a customer and let's go outside and chat about what I mean when I ask for something to be done. At the very second I couldn't take it I stopped her and said. You are ruining our dining expirence. How dare you talk to your colleges like this.. Brooke started laughing and asked if I was serious.. I replied this is no laughing matter and you should stop smiling immediately. As a business owner my self I am appalled that she thinks this is funny. I told her my family  are paying customers and have the right to enjoy our meal but instead I have been taking notes on her behavior. She said she was sorry but that's how she is she was just kidding with them and everyone likes it or leaves it. I told her she should be apologizing to Sam and Jenn for acting that way and the rest of the diner for literally ruining all our meals. at this time an older couple behind us started clapping an thanked us for standing up for in there words those 2 poor girls.. I told Brooke that once we left I  will be contacting the franchise owner. She grabbed her badge and said here is my name and its a corporation not a franchise. My family and I left utterly disgusted.

The attitude and complete lack of respect for her colleges makes me sick to my stomach. We will never be returning to any other smash burger and negativity travels fast. One oh shit moment erases a life time of compliments. I will be sharing my story with anyone who will listen including social media, yelp and the BBB.

For the sake of those 2 wonderful employees sake I hope this message is heard and that Brooke is reprimanded accordingly.

{"text":"I'm not a $7 burger kind of guy. Making a good hamburger is one of the easiest things in the world to do. But every once in a while you are out shopping, feeling lazy, and walk into the first burger place you find. SmashBurger serves very good $7 burgers. You can choose from a variety of topping, cheeses, buns. There are also hot dogs, chili fries, and salads to choose from. Go on-line to the website, sigh up for their promo offers, and within a day you will get a BO-GO coupon. Like them on Face book and you will receive more BO-GO offers. That brings the price down to $3.50 a burger, and that's the most a burger should ever cost. I'm feeling like a cheep old man here. I went for the BigSmash with blue cheese, and a side of sweet potato fries. Grub!"}
{"text":"Pricy, the mushroom burger was pretty good but on the small side and oily.  The chicken sandwich wasn't that good.  A pressed chicken breast, dry, and overall only the avocado and fresh veggies were good.  The fries were worth it though.  If you want a good burger, five guys or In-N-Out is a much better bet."}
{"text":"The guy named Alex who works there was awesome. Super friendly and made sure we needed everything we had. Great service!"}
{"text":"I got spinach cucumber goat cheese with the smash fries the meat was burn and fries was to. Gracie but the was u making order and u getting the number u waiting in the table ur food that s nice u not waiting they bringing ur food"}
{"text":"First time to any Smashburger. Figured one that just opened would be at the top of their game... I sure hope that's not the case for the chain though, as it really wasn't that great.

Went on a Tuesday evening around 7. Place was pretty dead. Cashier was friendly and on the ball. Ordered a Classic Smash with a side salad and an Arizona Grilled Chicken, extra lettuce & no guacamole, also with a side salad.

Took a while for the order to come out which was kinda weird... but it's worth the wait for non-heatlamp food. Around 8 minutes from payment to food.

Got home and saw my sandwich had guacamole (and a TON of it btw, don't need an ice cream scoop worth!) and... no extra lettuce. It's on the receipt so I know the cashier got it but obviously the cooks don't pay attention (or don't care?).

Otherwise it was ok. Nothing that blew us away... just another boring cookie-cutter fast food burger place. I'd put the food quality on par with Sonic maybe? Not a slight against either; we love our Sonic. But when you're spending $20 on two people for a pair of sandwiches... it better be damn good.

Go to the Habit or Five Guys instead if you want a REAL burger for this price range :)"}
{"text":"The service and food handling is marginal at best. The girl that took my order and handled the money also puts the food in the bag and on the trays without washing her hands. When I questioned her about it she had a bit of an \"attitude\" about it and she insisted that her hands don't touch the food. However, wearing gloves would certainly insure that. 
Although the foods ok, it's not so great that it makes up for that experience. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Smash burgers clean place in east Mesa courteous fast service good food .smash burgers are awesome beyond fast food I'd like their french fries I get them cooked up extra crispy wherever I go they were right on"}
{"text":"A nice place to have lunch if you want to feel a step up from the regular fast food restaurant.  The food is good (especially the fries and shakes) but a little overpriced for what you get.  Fans of the in n out next door will likely not be impressed and end up missing in n out's crispy lettuce and fresh tomatoes.  Smashburger ops out to using the dark limp lettuce you'd find at a McDonalds or BK, leaving their burger experience a little flacid."}
{"text":"Got coupons in the mail so we decided to come for lunch. Waited over 20 minutes and my burger came out overdone and my bun was burnt to a near crisp. I notified an employee but they still haven't brought me a new bun or tried to resolve the issue. And I wondered why it's been years since I've been here. I'm going next door to get a poke bowl."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location!  The cashier was really sweet and friendly.  The layout is very open and welcoming.  I know this will sound strange, but these booth seats are the squishiest that I have ever experienced!  Hahah. Feels like you're sitting on a monster pillow. 

The food was good. Nothing amazing, but good all the same. I had the bacon cheeseburger and fried pickles.  I kind of wish they had the fancy soda machine like at the newer location I'm Cotswold.  Smash burger is a little more expensive than I'd like it to be, but I'll definitely eat here again.  Especially when I'm craving fried pickles from he secret menu!!! Gah, how I love secrets."}
{"text":"I gave it another try a couple of days ago, went about 7:pm on a Thursday. The food was much better, came out as ordered, fresh and tasty. It was moderately busy, nothing too bad and the service was faster than it had been. My reservation in giving more stars is due to cleanliness. All the tables were dirty, no one came to collect our plates and there is a rack that hangs right beside the drink station with all the dirty floor cleaning supplies. I think these are easy fixes with a little more attention."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I was satisfied with the half pound burger, it was big and really hot when it came out.

It's not one of those places you eat at for every lunch but it is good to try once in a while. It is a bit overpriced but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Great alternative when you want something more than a fast food burger. Lots of really good choices you can't go wrong. Love the truffle mushroom that used to be on the menu but you can still request it. They also have great shakes. Try the chocolate Oreo!"}
{"text":"Great customer service here. The employees at the cash register were very friendly and helpful! They were patient with me and answered all my questions happily. They even gave me $2 off because it was my first time there. I had a great experience."}
{"text":"I love their milk shake!!!! Recommend Chocolate Oreo milkshake!!!! Their burger and fires are tasty too. I like truffle mushroom swiss burger and sweet potatoes fries."}
{"text":"Lemme just say I should've went with my \"gut\" instinct and decided to cancel my order as soon as the order taker said they couldn't cook my burger med-rare. But I already drove about 15 minutes from home and I had to try this sin city burger that I kept reading about in the local publications. So that's what I ordered and of course the burger was just blah. The meat was overcooked and a total waste of good angus beef. There was a sauce that looked like mustard-mayo, you know da kine like port-of-subs but this one had no flavor to it so it didn't do anything to help the lack luster meat it was sitting on top of. The side of fries was way overpriced for the same amount you would get in a kids meal at BK. Idk, I actually ate here a few years ago and I just finally decided to start yelping but my disappointment in this place is still fresh in my mind. Will I go back and try something else from their menu? I'm open to it if somebody drives me there and pays for my food. So that way if i'm still disappointed, at least I didn't waste my own gas or money."}
{"text":"We used to LOVE our local Smashburger, but have been noticing the quality and quantity of food has been diminishing more and more. Today was the worst visit yet. One example: my order was super simple, a plain burger with pickles, regular fries, and a drink. Half of the burger had...cheese??..thick sauce??.. whatever it was, it was all over it. I ordered the large size burger band cause it used to be just that, large! Not now, it was barely any bigger than the bun itself (a good example of the diminishing quantity I spoke of). Now on to the fries; they used to be delicious and unique to the restaurant, now they're just like you can find in the frozen food aisle at the grocery store. The large order was not nearly as big of an order as it used to be. Not only that, it had big pieces of chicken as well as onion rings mixed in with my fries. I could understand if it was a unique occurrence, but the continued frequency of these types of things happening have finally made us walk away and likely not return. What a shame, this truly was our go-to place to eat as often as 3 or 4 times a week until we started to see these things taking place."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I only will post a review on YELP when I have the absolute worst service or absolute best service. 
I have been to Smashburgers all over and let me tell you this is BY FAR the best one I've ever been to! It all starts with the friendliest and one of the hardest working people I've ever met, the manager Dontez. I hope he's getting the credit he deserves. Because of him I've made this my go to spot for lunch (when it use to be chipotle next door). He always greets me with a smile, remembers me, and treats me with the respect you want to be treated at a restaurant. He has put together the best staff! They all feed off of his good vibes and are very friendly and have never screwed up my order (and I can make it complicated at times). I will continue coming to this Smashburger multiple times a week for lunch thanks to the manager Dontez. Keep up the great work here!!"}
{"text":"I don't really get what all the hub-bub is about this place. Tried this place via a Groupon. The burger was ok but the Double at Wendy's is better in my opinion. It's a big burger that is sort of crunchy but is a bit overpriced ($5.99). The side dishes are ridiculously small. I mean you want to eat so why only get so many fries (which weren't bad btw). The other stuff like onion strings, veggie fries (carrots and asparagus) were not very good at all. Probably won't be back with so many fast food options at a better price point."}
{"text":"Loved Smashburger in Illinois, so glad we have one here now. It will be on the regular rotation, but competition is getting stiff for burger joints...awesome for us !  I'm sure they are working out some kinks since they just opened, but so far, pretty good. Food is good & service is quick."}
{"text":"Never answers phone. Never able to call in an order and pickup. Used online order system and took 15 min for my order to get to the store. Store then did not have my order ready and I was late back to work. Waste of my time and effort. The store was not even busy when I arrived and I got treated like I inconvenienced them."}
{"text":"I don't know why I don't come here more often. This is definitely in my top 3 favorite burger places of all time. I always get the mushroom truffle burger. DELICIOUSSS"}
{"text":"Horrible, I'll start by when we walked in it smelled like b.o. baaaad! It was filthy all the trash cans were filled, when we left I just had a dirty feeling. Staff was polite."}
{"text":"Food was great, but overall attitude of the employees was shitty. The cashier who rang me, a red headed pimple faced fuck, rolled his eyes and acted like it was a task to ring me up for a cup. So these bitches get one star.."}
{"text":"Eew. Eew. Eew. So gross! 
My burger tasted like salt was poured all over it. It was so gross. I worked my way through about half of it and walked out dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Cotswold location. I waited for a take out order for 25 minutes only to get home to discover:

1. Two orders were wrong. 
2. The tots were so greasy the seat on my car had oil on that seeped it through the bag. 
3. Old/ browning avocados used. 


I was excited to see this location open up so close to my house. But I'll just go to Cotswold next time where I know the quality and attention to detail is better."}
{"text":"The burgers here are great! The patties here are packed (or I guess \"smashed\") with such a juicy flavor. I recommend the Swiss Mushroom or the Classic Smashburger, you can't go wrong with any of them. As for sides I recommend the Smashfries. It's cooked in rosemary, garlic and olive oil. Very tasty! If you want another side you can try the fried pickles. They're something you'd definitely want to try.

I went here because I had heard someone say that this place has better buggers than In-N-Out. If I were to rank this place out of all the burger joints in Vegas, this place would rank a close first to In-N-Out; and it's way better than Fuddruckers."}
{"text":"Wow.  Perhaps just the best burger I have ever had.  Mushroom swiss with sweet potato fries and fried pickles.  Service was good, the staff was very friendly and I liked that there were tables available outside.  My diet won't allow me to come back as often as I would like but I WILL  be back!!  Tasty."}
{"text":"Quick service, simple menu. Food was pretty good (but for a burger fries and a drink is $10 is that good pricing?). I got the smash fries, they taste like Rosemary. The spice, not the woman. I'd go again."}
{"text":"When the daily conversation inevitably turned to \"what's for lunch?\", the suggestions didn't come as easily as they normally do. In fact, it took so long to decide, we just rolled out of work and kind of went \"on the fly\", much later than usual and right in the middle of the traditional lunch hour. I thought we were headed for a chinese buffet, but I wasn't driving (or paying attention) and somehow we wound up in the area of Lake Mead and Tenaya, surrounded by a plethora of choices for the midday meal.

Not being one to ever pass on an opportunity for a good burger, I said \"what about Smashburger?\" We rolled in to a crowded parking lot and thought we might have to find another place to dine, as we are not the patient kind, did not want to wait in line and were beyond hungry. As luck have it, the crowded parking lot is kind of deceptive.  We walked in and were pleasantly surprised there was no wait. The lunch crowd here seemed to get a little bigger closer to the end of the noon hour.

Whoever came up with the idea to put a fried egg on a burger should be Knighted, or at least be made king for a day. The Sin City Burger was fantastic. The meat was fresh and flavorful. The egg and all that accompanied it made the burger that much better. I opted for the Buffalo Fries, and they didn't disappoint. Seasoned with Buffalo seasoning, they were hot (to the touch), a little spicy and full of flavor. The service was fast and friendly and they even came to clean off the table.

If you are looking for a great meal in the middle of the day, served fast and fresh, give Smashburger a try. I've eaten at many of the other options in the area and Smashburger definitely holds their own when it comes to quality, service and price."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night snack after the club food was hot and fresh love the smash fries they have to be my favorite. Service was friendly as well they even made small talk."}
{"text":"The best chicken burger I've EVER had.  No doubt.  Bar none.  Yes please.

I was visiting Phoenix when I was hungry and a friend wanted a burger.  We came here, and I put on my silly California face saying \"I've never heard of a Smashburger\".  

The menu is pretty simple.  Chicken or Beef.  A few pre-designed choices or make your own burger.

I opted for the grilled chicken mushroom swiss, add mushrooms and include their tossed fries in oil and spices.  

I don't know what to say without saying it was the best burger I've ever had in my life.  It had so much flavor.  

I long to visit Arizona again, but have now discovered I can have it again locally at one of the very few in SoCal.  Just a 40 minute drive to Culver City and I'm there!"}
{"text":"When you want a great burger, expedient and friendly service and a casual welcoming atmosphere, this is the place!

The selection is great, prices reasonable, food fresh and best of all, never too busy to accommodate your special requests.

My partner and I look forward to future visits and giving 4 stars only due to ordering at counter prior to seating and not table side. This is perfectly ok and the post order delivery table side follow-up service in ensuring you have all you need is perhaps better than the typical competitor."}
{"text":"So, how much do you like hamburgers?  Do you like them enough to pay $8 for one?  Do you like them enough to willingly go near ASU?  If you're still nodding your head, chances are good that you'll like Smashburger.  

As burger joints go, it's one of the nicer ones--clean, stylish decor, and friendly employees are big pluses here.  You will pay for those pluses though, when you find yourself forking over more than $10 for the prototypical burger, fries, and high fructose corn syrup drink of your choice.  

What you'll get for that ten-spot is somewhat distinctive though.  Smashburger's claim to fame, of course, is the way that they seer the burger patty, thus getting it piping hot in a hurry.  What this means for you is that you'll be the proud owner of one of the messier burgers in America.  Grab plenty of napkins and plan to wear a shirt you don't mind getting greasy.  

I suppose the fries are a love em'/hate 'em affair.  If you're a traditionalist, prepare to be annoyed:  Smashfries are doused in oil and herbs.  They make a nice taste, but get old pretty quickly and I've never been able to finish an order.

Though hardly cheap or perfect, I like Smashburger on occasion as it's a nice change from the usual fast food fare."}
{"text":"The restaurant is new with a new staff.  The burgers are good.  I would have given this restaurant a 4 or 5 Stars except I ordered a big burger which I have done at other SmashBugers.  When my burger came out it was their regular sized patty.  I did question it but the young lady just said it was their big patty.   At the other Smashburgers I have eaten at the burger was bigger than the bun.  Not here.  I believe it was a mistake, so go but do not order the big patty."}
{"text":"This location is close to work so I was hoping it would be a great go to lunch spot.

There might be better options on the menu, so take my review or leave it, but with other options in the area, I won't go back unless I'm with a party and get over-ruled.

I had the make your own burger and opted for the small burger with grilled shrooms/onions and fresh jalepenos.  The burger was cooked as ordered and was decently flavored.

I chose the smashburger fries, which in concept sound great (drizzled with olive oil and rosemary), but I like crisp fries and mine seemed less drizzled and more doused or floating.

Adding a small drink and I was at $11.

The girl at the next table had a salad that looked fresh, but for the price, I thought seemed awfully skimpy.

My favorite thing about the place was the little metal basket things that the food was served in and unfortunately if the most memorable part of the meal is the utensils... there is a problem.

Save your money and head over to five guys."}
{"text":"So the parking at this location during lunch is a clusterfk. Minus a point for choosing a crappy location on the corner. 

They mixed our names on the orders, meaning I got someone else's food. 

The burger is thin and just okay, wasn't piping hot either, made me think of McDonald's. 

When I called to mention they messed up the order, they don't answer their phones.

In any case, I'll be keeping my business at Five Guys and would not recommend Smashburger."}
{"text":"Its only spot open for breakfast besides Starbucks in this little food court area. Everything else opens at 11am for lunch. 
Smash burger had their breakfast burger options until 11am as well. There's only 3 items to choose from: the egg and cheese sandwich, bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, and the breakfast burger. 
I got the breakfast burger which had patty, egg, and cheese. It was pretty good, but super tiny and pricey for its size. But then again, what isn't overpriced in Vegas."}
{"text":"Smashburger Review - My experience and WHY you should eat here!

This was my first time going to Smashburger, after hearing good things about it from my brother and a few people I know. 

Overall experience was great, but let me break it down for ya. 

Menu: 

- Simple (small selection, but easy to read and make a choice)
- Signature burgers and chicken sandwiches
- Variety of salads
- Build your own choices
- Regular size and Big size to choose from for your burger

Service:

- Very welcoming and helpful when I asked questions
- Brought our order out to us after we ordered
- Wait time was a couple minutes, not bad at all though

Restaurant:

- Clean and modern looking interior
- Open seating, booths and tables with chairs
- Comfortable booth seats and lot's of table space
- Clean restrooms

Food:

- BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger was great, good size and cooked perfectly
- Sweet potato smashfries were AMAZING, prob the best I ever had
- Girlfriend got the Mushroom swiss burger, she loved it, good size too
- Girfriend got the regular smash fries and they were good, nice and crispy
- They also offer beers, and let you have it in a bottle or a mug

Cost:

- More than I was expecting, but the quality and service balanced it out. 
- If you were to compare the prices from burger joints now a days, it's not much    
  more expensive when you really think about it. The dollar menus is what makes 
  up for their \"regular prices\" if you break it down. 

Smashburger Review Continued:

** Our bill came out to about $20 after everything. Considering the quality, service, and options, it's worth it. 

** The \"Smashfries\" are tossed in olive oil and herbs, and given as an option for both regular fries and sweet potato fries. Cost a $1 more I believe than regular fries.  

** When you order a burger or chicken sandwich, the fries are NOT included and will need to be ordered separately. Cost is about $2-$3 depending on if you choose regular or smashfry style. 

Smashburger would be great for all types of people, great for a casual dinner or lunch, and even better for a good place to grab some food and a beer without going to the bar. 

Overall experience was great, will definitely be going back very soon, and would recommend this place to anyone whose looking for a good burger or sweet potato fries. 

If your NOT a \"cheap-ass\", then you will definitely respect this place, but if your a person whose life is run by your money, instead of YOU running your own life, then this place is NOT for you!

Hope this helped. 

Please leave comments or connect with me on facebook. 

Until next time,

{"text":"This was my first time and I am not compelled to come back. The burgers and their subsequent ingredients were not overly original and the prices were high for something you could get most other places."}
{"text":"Okay, I'll be back.... 

Nice floor plan, not a lot of hype, tasty and priced right.

Pro's: 1/3 # was plenty.  Had the classic just to taste a basic no real frills (I.e. extraneous flavors) burger.  Burger was flavorful and the cheese was a little too much, but that's just me.   Bun was pretty good but did have some bun-failure toward the end of mowing down the burg..   Nice presentation of burger and frys (I.e. not in cheap plastic trays) in wire serving trays. 

Con's: dagnabit, the frys were nothing special.  I had the \"fancy\" frys (tossed in rosemary and olive oil), no big deal, actually disappointing.  

I enjoyed the meal and will be back when I have a craving for cow.   Still have to give Lobby's a second chance (first round goes to Smashburger....no hype on special sauce, good burger - a draw between the two... But like the decor and presentation on SB..."}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent.  Amazing burgers and chicken sandwiches. The shakes were so rich with flavor , and the smash friends bring a unique and flavorful addition to the already delicious burgers and chicken  sandwiches.  If your looking for a healthier option, they have veggie fries, sweet potato fries and salads  as well.  Only downside is that it's a bit too pricey."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joints the food is consistently delicious. They have a pretty good selection of burgers and the place is always clean. And the atmosphere is pretty consistent. If you want a good burger in a chill place it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Not great but worth revisiting! The grilled chicken sandwich was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice restaurant but when I was taking my seat there are circular lights over the chairs and there was some black objects blocking the light from the circle and when I shook it a little a fry fell right out of the light it was very disgusting but I enjoyed the food, It was just weird that someone put a fry in the circular light..."}
{"text":"Great shakes

Colorado burger is awesome 

Nice a quick for lunch

Yelp won't let me review only a few words so I am adding this sentence"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a minute now. I got good to great reviews for this place through word of mouth. I wish I didn't wait this long after going here for lunch today.

I was told to get the Classic SmashBurger, but I opt for the Sin City Burger. Comes with a fried egg, applewood smoked BACON (FOR REALLY DOE?!?), American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions, and Smash Sauce on an egg bun (The egg bun is right up there with potato buns yallz).  This was a gangsterish burger. I will definately try the other burgers but with some extra toppings which you can opt for. Nice SmashBurger!!! :)

All in all, this was a great experience. The price was not crazy and the burger was solid. The Sin City Burger was nicely put together. Thanks Chicago!!! 4 Stars. EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!! :D"}
{"text":"I love the burgers here.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and playful.  I appreciate the atmosphere they are trying to create.  Russell delivered our food, made sure we were all square, and introduced himself just in case we needed something else."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and avoid this location it is a disaster. So poorly managed, the manager is ill equipped and clearly doesn't belong managing anywhere. Literally food was not coming up being lost, huh. The owner/general manager needs to be present and or cooperate needs to step in.  Just discovered I must be losing my mind, ordered my food at 7:35 and as I write this its 8:13 still waiting on my food."}
{"text":"Family loved it BBQ BACON CHEDDAR YEE, Avacado chicken club yeee and there fries are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the spiciness of the Arizona burger.

With today's meal we got a little confused and mis-ordered something but Jalissa, the manager, was more than eager to fix it for us.  There was a lot of positive energy from the staff and they kept things moving smoothly.

I'm impressed with both the food and, especially, the service.  My biggest problem is being careful to not over-order and get the shake and the fries and the everything else.

Overall, I've been very pleased with my meals at this location."}
{"text":"Uhh 2 stars cause their food is good, but seriously? Don't advertise a \"double patty\" burger then essentially split the meat of a single patty and turn it into two tiny patties and call it a deal. The patties were SO small the slice of cheese was hiding the \"second\" one. I've noticed that over time Smashburger has started cheating out on their portions.. smaller buns, smaller patties, such a shame. Switching gears to five guys or shake shack I guess."}
{"text":"I think this is the only Smash Burger location I have been to, and I have liked it every time! Delicious, quality fast food with an excellent vegetarian option available for me to enjoy.

The service has been mostly good for me. Had a cashier charge us $2.00 just for a cup of water once, but he took it off after we said something. I always get a build year own burger with the black bean patty. The black bean patty is very good, probably one of the best black bean patties around. The french fries are incredible as well.

Would love to try a shake from here, they sound awesome, but I always end up too full from all the other tasty food. Will be making a return here!"}
{"text":"If you get a hankering for a quick, delicious (and unhealthy) burger fix, you have to go to Smashburger.  Since the burger craze started, there have been an influx of burger joints all claiming to be the best burger in town.  I think this one has the best mix of grease, salt and bun.  When it comes to price, it has a great price point (under $6.00) for a burger, the fries are good although the onion rings admittedly are a little dry but overall, the patty is delicious.  If I'm not going more upscale with Delux, this is the place to go after a day of shopping at the Collonade."}
{"text":"Went here about a week ago. I ordered the Avocado club regular size and Smash fries. The person who took the order had a good attitude and took his time as we said it was our first time there. 

The order came out really quick. My wife's and my burgers were cooked perfectly and juicy not greasy.  The smash fries were a tad on the oily side though it does have olive oil drizzled on it. My wife ordered the sweet potato fries and they were really good which I usually don't like them. 

The size of the burger was really good for the smaller option. The bun was out of this world. I don't think I've had a bun that was so fresh and perfect. The burger toppings were extremely fresh also. 

They let me try the truffle sauce and the smash sauce. I was warned of the strength of the truffle sauce and was not disappointed.  The smash sauce was really good until my wife reminded me its everything that's in egg salad with out the eggs. Still good though. 

This is currently one of my favorite burgers. The only drawback is due to the price. While the only thing in and out has over it is in price the other competition in the area doesn't even come close."}
{"text":"When you select the third star on the review entry page, the associated text reads \"A-OK.\"  This perfectly describes Smashburger, or at least how I view it.  We had been wanting to try it since it opened, but never quite managed to do so, since it seemed the line was out the door every time we went.  This past weekend, however, things seemed a lot more reasonable, so we took the plunge.

At Smashburger, you place your order at the counter, and an employee brings your food to the table when it's ready.  If you've eaten at Showmars or McAlister's, you know the routine.  There was only one slightly awkward moment: you pick up a menu at the door and are supposed to drop it off at the register after you order, but it's a pretty big sheet of paper, and there isn't really anywhere to leave it. 

Once the food arrived, it was decent.  Not much more than that.  I got the classic, since I figured it was a fair first-time test.  The burger actually had some pink in the middle, which was a plus, but the patty could've stood a little more seasoning.  The bun was unremarkable.  As a side, I ordered rosemary-specked sweet potato fries.  Those were good: probably better than the burger, objectively speaking.

Honestly, if you want a burger from a chain, Five Guys is better, even though there isn't one in the immediate area.  If you are looking for a burger in Stonecrest, City Tavern is better (if more expensive).  Smashburger was decent; I may eat there again, but I won't be making any trips to Stonecrest just to visit it."}
{"text":"I really like how clean and friendly it is at the Smashburger.

I didn't care much for the burger itself but the fixings were good.  Shoestring fries aren't my favorite either, it's like you have to eat a mouth full to taste some potato, gimmie some big ol steak fries!  I had a really great conversation with one of my professors here so that made my meal stellar!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch. The salads are incredible. The local beers are great. The fried pickles are addictive. They would get five stars but they routinely screw up my rewards redemption. Very frustrating and when I call them on it last time out, I was treated rudely. It's a good thing their food is so good. My kids love this place - especially the shakes."}
{"text":"We usually go here at least once a month and Amanda always helps us! She is so friendly and always remembers our First Responder discount and really is a fast, hard-working employee. The food is great but their customer service is even better!"}
{"text":"Good little bigger joint, when we went it was really slow but we got our food fast and it was good.  I got the sin city Burger, I would recommend this if you want good fast eats for a good price."}
{"text":"While walking around Caesars Palace, we saw the food court with every restaurant closed until 11am, except for Smashburger. Since I've never had it before, I had to try it because all my friends were raving about it. They only had breakfast options, but who doesn't want a big juicy beef burger topped with bacon and eggs after a long night of drinking?

The first bite was heavenly and just what I need! The cheese was melted and dripping as I was eating. The buns were delicious too! About 3/4 of the way in, I was stuffed, but I made myself finish it as it is a crime to waste good food! Too bad I didn't get to try their lunch menu, but I will be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Smashburger because we had heard it was the best non-sit down burger place. I had the classic smashchicken sandwich with a side of onion haystacks. The sandwich was really good and I especially liked the sauce that came on the side. It was like a zesty cross between thousand island and ketchup. I liked that the chicken was grilled and not breaded. My fiance had the Arizona burger with a side of french fries. He said it was really tasty. It came with guac, chipolte mayo, pepper jack cheese and jalapenos. 

We got our food to go so we could head home to watch the Suns game. We didn't have to wait very long at all and the employees were very friendly. The patio is a bummer view of the Best Buy/ Fryes parking lot. But the inside is exceptionally clean and the service is fast. 

There are so many restaurants in this area but I like this place because you get a decent burger at a good price minus the drama. You don't have to valet park or watch people trying to look cool while eating a burger. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I am from Hawaii and a regular patron of In-N-Out Burger when I visit California or Las Vegas. My brother told me about this burger joint Smashburger so I had to try it. I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Smashburger and my husband got the All-American Smashburger. We also tried their Smashfries with their seasoning of rosemary, olive oil, and garlic. The burger was delish! I really liked the texture of the meat and the amount you get. Plus my burger was loaded with mushrooms as the cooks seemed to be super generous with the portion. It was really tasty. The fries were also great and the seasonings were good too. The prices to me are pretty reasonable considering we got the 1/3 lbs. each with a grandtotal of about $14 bucks. I would definitely eat here again. It's funny how their sign resembles the GameStop sign. Makes me want to eat a burger and play xbox."}
{"text":"I'm not in love with this place. I'll admit this location had some pretty steep competition, with Bachi Burger being so close. 
I ordered The Baja and it was good enough, just not great. It was really spicy and had pretty good flavor. 
The fries are skinny and pretty good although I prefer fat fries. The weren't too crispy but they weren't soggy either. 

I like that they give you sides of ketchup in 2 oz portion cups, and I asked for a side of ranch and they didn't charge me. 

I think the inside decor is nice. Place seemed clean and staff was friendly. I moved them up to 4 stars because I don't think their proximity to the best burger in town should affect their rating. I just don't know how often I'll be back with Bachi and Five Guys so close."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I wasn't sure I wanted to give this place a try but I'm so glad I did. The place was clean, the staff was very helpful and friendly and the food was delivered fast and delicious. I tried the steel city burger on a pretzel roll with onion straws and my friend had a regular smash with french fries. Everything was fresh and amazing. Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Took the family for dinner just before the 6:00 pm rush, get there early or the line will be long!  Not alot of tables, but there are more outside. I'm a sweet potato fry freak, they were very tasty!! My husband got the Swiss mushroom cheeseburger which was so flavorful. I like the fact that you can order it to your liking. I like my plain grilled chicken breast sandwich wrapped in a lettuce bun. Hit the spot. 
We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Burgers in my mind are supposed to be grilled over a flame, thick and medium rare. Served with a toasted bun, american cheese with let/tom/pic/mayo and mustard. (It's my review)

SB does most of it perfectly. 

The Bun is a yellow egg bun, toasted and topped with all the required toppings. 

The toppings were all fresh and very good, including the cheese. 

The burger, while it is a 1/2 l/b about 1/3 was lapping over the bun. It is a thin, flat fried burger, sort of crispy on one side too. While not my preferred, it was still a good tasting burger. Just not great. 

IMHO Five guys is better if fried burgers are your thing. 

The staff was great. The management was great, the place was pretty clean the price was high for what I recieved. $6 burger $1.80 drink.  
(it was plenty of food though)

3.86 stars"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, but they took the goat cheese off the menu. That was the big draw for me, but thankfully there's other options. This location is new and is really good! I had the Avocado Club at this location. They waiter was really helpful too."}
{"text":"Imagine if In-n-Out became a fancy-shmancy restaurant. It would be Smashburger.

I am a health conscious person, and while a lot of their burgers may be super tasty (the Sin City one was good, but way too greasy for me), there is one that is tasty and still semi-healthy. The goat cheese and spinach sandwich got me addicted to goat cheese. This sandwich is just really good and the ingredients are superb. I have yet to try the salad version of the sandwich. I know these probably are not healthy, but the smash fries (with olive oil and rosemary) are amazing (I just keep telling myself that olive oil is good for you...)."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favorite places to go for a cheat meal. I love the burgers and the Arizona Burger is my fav. They can be a little pricey but its way better than a regular fast food burger."}
{"text":"The Swiss burger is heaven......the fries crispy and not greasy. The chocolate shake, spot on!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Smashburger. Things I enjoyed - 

1. Smash Fries
2. Sweet Potato Fries
3. The Smash Sauce on my juicy burger
4. The Bun - can I get an EGG BUN?! Heck yes!

Things I less than enjoyed
1. The lacy burger patty - meaning, a patty thin enough that you can see though it in parts 
2. TBH- the price to value comparison 
3. The large-ish dying bug on the floor next to my table seen after I was done eating

So, in sum, The burger has some good things going for it - it's got FLAVOR- but I guess I'm not sold on the whole experience."}
{"text":"After waiting our turn in line and approaching the register, I was surprised to find out that this Smashburger location was the first ever built in Las Vegas! Not a bad idea at all by the folk over at corporate Smashburger trying to test the waters by putting a location right across the street from about 30,000 hungry collegiate students, some of whom are undoubtedly sick of the campus food.

After putting our order in I was sad to hear that they no longer accept the 10% off with the Yelp app check-in anymore. However, in lieu of the discount the nice lady behind the register comped one of our burgers instead!

Much like the other Smashburger locations, the food is tried, tested, and always a home run. It tastes great, is brought to your table quickly, and an employee is always there for a follow-up to ask how the food was."}
{"text":"Reluctant at first to try a burger boasted for it's smashed thin meat, I walked in and was greeted by the friendly staff. They asked if it was my first time there as I gazed upon the large menu to the right of the counter. They offered tips, suggestions, and successfully guided me in selecting my big Sin City Burger and side of Smash Fries with a fountain drink. I did think it was interesting that they had $1 cans of PBR and other brands that came with a frosty mug available with the purchase of any food item. They gave me my order number and instructed me to sign up on their website in order to receive a free burger on my next visit.

When my burger was brought out to me my eyes were immediately drawn to the egg bun. It appeared fresh, fluffy, and had a wonderful golden yellow color to it that made me want to grab it and take a bite. The burger was topped with fried egg, bacon, American cheese, grilled onion and haystack onions. Upon mastication I was sold! The burger was phenomenal. I tend to cherish any burger that involves egg, but this one in particular was choice. One issue I had which could easily be remedied my following visit, would be to ask for no grilled onions. It already included haystack onions (aka shoestring onions) and the addition of grilled onions seemed to overpower the sandwich. Also, they would not allow me to order my egg to be 'runny', they make them only one way. Through ordering the bigger version of the sandwich I noticed the meat patty itself was much larger than the bun which lead me to believe their buns only come in one size (no joke intended). The Smash Fries were simply regular thin cut french fries with rosemary, garlic and olive oil over them. A nice and welcome spin on what would have been an ordinary order of fries.

One of the coworkers I was there with had ordered a 'create-your-own-burger' and the cooks had neglected to put bacon on the burger he had ordered and paid for. Upon notifying the staff, they quickly amended the problem and gave him a coupon for a free burger the next time he came in. A very nice gesture.

All in all, my lunch was a success. I was very satisfied with my meal and I look forward to returning for my free burger! I think it is safe to say I will become a regular at this chain burger joint."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that this location had opened up so close to home, and was even more surprised upon finding out that it had been open for over five months! At least that means I am good at keeping my eyes on the road while driving... right? Anyway, being that this is a chain you can typically expect the same product that has been pumped out with scientific precision a million times before. The Sin City Burger I enjoyed was phenomenal and tasted no different from the ones made at the other locations I have visited. A tad pricey for a burger, Smashburger continuously makes up for it with quality of ingredients. With the addition of $1 cans of PBR with dine-in food purchase, you can't go wrong!

The interior of this location is nice, fresh, and clean. Like the other locations this one does not have any TVs, which I thought was unfortunate as it would've been nice to catch the football game that was on (even though as a New York Jets fan my whole team is undoubtedly on a golf course somewhere). The staff was extremely friendly and checked on our table multiple times to ensure our dining experience was pleasurable."}
{"text":"amazing burgers. I absolutely love this place!!! Fully customizable burgers decent price. Gotta love it."}
{"text":"Just go to Inn& Out across the street. It will save you money, time, a bad stomach ache and a terrible yelp review."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean when we walked in and we were greeted promptly. The gentleman at the counter, Kencaid, was very helpful, polite, and upbeat. All around genuine and he made a good experience Great!"}
{"text":"Wow!  After all the great reviews we were so excited to try Smashburger.  What a disappointment.  My chicken mushroom sandwich was a greasy salt lick.  My husbands burger was also really salty and doesn't hold a candle to Habit Burger.  Over priced for what it is.  Fry's were very good.  Parking sucked.  We need a Habit Burger closer than I-10 and Ray Road."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy  love the fries. I wish the portions were bigger. Friendly staff and hot food"}
{"text":"I love Smashburger!  I get the \"classic\" wih sweet potato fries.  I love that the burger comes to piping hot and it takes at least 10 minutes or more to  get your order.  The toppings are always fresh, never wilted.   I will continue to go there for my carnivore craving."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened and it has really gone downhill in the past few months. It seems they have new management that scrimps on everything. 
My husband and I ordered online to-go and when we went to pick it up, fries weren't ready. Further, when we pointed out that the veggie frites were half of what a typical order is, they said that was their normal. Also, when we came home and checked out a burger, the requested extra spinach was not on the burger (also, what little spinach present was wilted when it used to be fresh) and the cucumbers were so thin as to be translucent. The burgers were also very salty. Before this new management took over,  orders were ready for pick-up, toppings on burgers were actually present as requested, and sides were full-sized. This was the second time we encountered this situation at this location and it's very disappointing. For the money and the hassle, I suggest going to In-N-Out a few blocks away."}
{"text":"I started coming here when they first opened and I found the burgers to be very good but super greasy.  So for awhile, I stopped coming here.  Recently, I decided to swing back based upon some recommendations from friends. I'm very happy that I came back. The burgers are delicious and the Smash-fries are amazing!  This place tastes a lot like Freddy's Steakburgers. I actually think they might purchase their products from the same supplier. In any case, I really like coming here, even though they are a bit pricy.  They have a rewards program too so eventually you get a free burger.  This restaurant is consistently clean and the staff is friendly. A while back, there was a small misunderstanding and the staff member quickly rectified it to my satisfaction.   I will continue to frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Food is soooooo good but it's too bad the employees don't know what they're doing. There were two other parties eating there and we had ours to go. They kept bringing us other peoples food. The first time the food belonged to the people sitting next to us. The 2nd and 3rd time belonged to the people sitting behind Us. When the guy tried to give us their food and we told them it wasn't ours... he looked at us like we were stupid. Thank you for that. Finally he brought it back and questioned it with the billion girls that were working and they finally told him the food belonged to the people behind us. We finally got our food  and will not return to this location. Remember, the food is soooo good but the people are NOT."}
{"text":"Really huge disappointment tonight. They deserve negative stars but not able to in the yelp app. Purchased a BBQ burger combo and kids meal. Cashier was rude and rushed me as I asked questions. Not sure what the hurry was because there was no one else in line. Took our food home and fries were cold and stale. BBQ burger was ordered well done but this one was not recognizable as any form of meat patty it was so burnt. The kids meal was a patty on a bun with cheese sliding out the side of it. No condiments were on the burger. Not sure if it comes plain but wasn't asked or offered toppings when placing my order. The food was so bad I put it back in the bags, drove back and asked for a refund. Refund was given but no apology. Manager had \"just left \" no one claimed to be in charge. Save yourself several bucks and get In N Out burger across the street. Always friendly. Always hot fresh good tasting food."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I like Smash Burger. They are a decent chain restaurant, and the atmosphere at this particular location is casual and hip. 

Most everything is a la carte, and the prices range from anywhere between $5.99 to $6.99+ depending on what kind of burger you'd like. The fries average $1.99 for a medium and up to $3.49 depending on the type of fries you pick. Oh, and of course, you should order a beverage with your meal that will also cost a minimum of $1.99. Bottom line, you can easily spend a hefty chunk of change for a burger, fries, and a drink. Is it worth it?... Sure, depending on what you order. 

I ordered the Sin City burger, which I would assume is their most popular selection, as it is conveniently placed at the very top of the menu. It has bacon and a fried egg on it. All in all, it's pretty tasty. 

I give the place a 3 star outta 5 because I was disappointed with their Smash Fries which come topped with garlic and rosemary. The fries are shoe-string style, and they're isn't too much flavor because the chef wasn't too giving with the garlic and rosemary. Also, I had one of their HaagenDaz milkshakes; the chocolate Oreo flavor. I was disappointed about how thin the shake was. The advertisement on the wall stated that their milkshakes were thick, but alas, they're thin and easy to drink throw a straw. I'm partial to thick milkshakes, the kind that hurt your cheeks from all the suction:-) Also, their wasn't much Oreo in my shake.  

They do have a rewards system set in place for loyal customers, so if you plan on returning, be sure to sign up while ordering."}
{"text":"Gross.  I ordered a burger with no mustard and to add mayonnaise.  there was no mayo but loads of mustard.  Jalapeños on it were raw.  Not pickled.  Everything was so salty (and I don't find McDonald's unbearably salty) I could barely eat it.   Should have returned it.  Terrible. Try 5 guys."}
{"text":"I like Smashburgers and this location is the closet to me.

What can I say I enjoy a good burger and Smashburger delivers to my taste bud. You can order beer here, which I don't think this particular location does well since there are so many kids running around.  Then again it's close to a movie theater and I gather and the teenagers need a place to loiter.  

I always order my favorite the Arizona burger with sweet potato fries!  I love the kick it has with the jalapenos and guacamole.  I wonder if each state has it's own burger? - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not bad since I was tad bit worried when I saw the patty.  A little thin I thought to myself.  

However, my first bite into it was delightful!  I ordered the Arizona - Habanero Cheese, Guacamole, Chipotle Mayo, on a Chipotle bun.  Though it was a tad bit spicy I scarfed my burger down in less than 5 minutes.  Maybe I should have ordered the larger size.  I love my burgers with Jalapenos and an extra kick and the Arizona delivered.  I was disappointed by the fries though; very plain and my sweet potato fries were soggy -- Blah!

The ambience has that modern diner feel and look.  Stainless steel and high vaulted ceilings make this place cold and loud.  I didn't mind, but I sat outside regardless.  On a perfect night I recommend that - good food and good weather -- sign! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sure Smashburger is a \"chain burger place\" but that doesn't necessarily mean they act nor serve food that taste like any ordinary burger chain restaurant...  They are much better than many other fast food places and well worth the few extra bucks you'll pay for a good burger and fries.

We tried their Arizona Smashburger with fried pickles. The burger was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of seasoning and temperature!  It came with fresh guac, jalepenos, chipotle mayo, other veggies with Habanero cheese served on a chiptole bun.  It was fantastic! The fried pickles were also a nice change to fries. Crispy with lite batter and some ranch dressing for dipping.  You've got to try these!

We also had the Classic Smashburger with their Smashfries. Again the burger was cooked exceptionally well with just the right balance of seasoning and temp.  Their Smashfries are fries tossed with olive oil, salt, garlic and rosemary. The seasoning was spot on! We've ate fries that are very similar at Diablo Burger in Flag, but the fries at Smashburger are better balanced with rosemary/garlic and salt.

Recommendation: order a create your own 1/3 lb Smashburger with which ever bun, but ask for them to toast it ~ they will! Then add an extra 1/3 lb patty and request them to cook it the temp you want it ~ they will. Choose the cheese of your choice with either smashsauce or chipotle mayo and then get all the veggies including jalapenos. Your total will be $6.99 for a 2/3 lb burger of deliciousness that will leave you planning your next trip to Smashburger!  Don't forget to try their fried pickles and down everything with a cold bottle of beer."}
{"text":"Food was  Smashburger good. Service was very friendly.  Had a Four Peaks  Peach  Ale with my lunch,  yep they  have Four Peaks in bottles. 
Sat outside on the patio and enjoying the December sunshine.  
I can see this place getting full at lunch time,  small parking lot up front but more in the back. Come early and enjoy a burger."}
{"text":"My first time at this place. Walked in the door and was immediately greeted with a clean, surprisingly spacious restaurant. 

Since I mentioned it was my first time here, the very helpful attendant gave me a brief tour of the menu and gave me some of his personal recommendations.  One of which was the \"classic\".  I also ordered the \"Smashfries\", and a chocolate milkshake.  

It was served quite quickly despite how busy it was, and the server was very polite.

Then, the moment of truth, I bit into the burger and... All I can say, indescribably good.  Think In-N-Out, but with a better bun and less grease. Very, very tasty.  The fries, just wow. Thoroughly flavored with rosemary and garlic, but a little heavy on the olive oil.  They were absolutely delicious nonetheless.  The shake. Oh. My. Gosh.  The shake was rich and creamy. Perfect consistency!

My one and only complaint:  it is a teeny bit pricey.  I probably won't be a frequent customer due to that fact.  But if I ever want to treat myself, I will definitely drop in!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant where I really wish I could give a half star--it's a 4.5 star burger place. Located right near the fountain at Stonecrest, Smashburger is in a great location. On Fridays and Saturdays from 7-10, you're treated to live music outside (only in the summer). Decor inside is very modern and minimalistic, but it has a nice vibe to it that says 21st century.

The food is really good--the burgers are delicious and the toppings are even better. I get the Carolina Burger, which is a patty with cole slaw, barbecue sauce, and pimento cheese. Delicious burger. The fries (I think I just ordered \"fries\" instead of \"Smashfries\" were okay, kind of like the one's you'd find at McDonalds. Eh, kind of a disappointment. My dad got a grilled chicken sandwich, and reported the grilled chicken was very good as well.

You can usually get a coupon for this place if you like them on Facebook or join their email list. Overall, smashburger delivers a smashing burger with lacking fries. Next time I try the Smashfries, I'll update the review.

EDIT: Took Carolina Burger off the menu. -1 star."}
{"text":"Used the online order system to get a pick up delivery. This is the first time (and more than likely the last) we have went to this location and the food looked horrible. We started our experience in the restaurant with a woman who was already at the counter explaining her disgust with the presentation of her food. As we picked up our order and took it home, we experienced the same unsatisfactory service. The patties themselves resembled asphalt after an 8.0 earthquake, just cracked, crumbled and tossed onto buns that were apparently picked out of a bag that was used as bean bag chair. I'm guessing this is why it is called \"smash\" burger? The toppings presentation must have been applied by a school cafeteria worker as they were completely separated like a lunch tray. I only rate this experience 2 merely because they at least served everything ordered, although it seems they kept it in an active clothes dryer to keep it warm until we came to pick it up. (which was set on delicate because the food was still luke warm.)"}
{"text":"My wife's favorite burgers. We love the Veggie Frites. Fried Pickles are good, too."}
{"text":"I've tried Smash Burger now a few times since my initial check-in here and well, for a fast-casual burger joint, it's really not too bad. I'd say I prefer it to In-N-Out, but I do have one complaint: sometimes, specifically at this location, the burgers do tend to be a little salty. I would recommend toning the salt down, just a pinch. Otherwise, a better than average experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. It can be a bit crowded at times but the Smash Fries are the best fries ever. Burgers are juicy and they have some of the best salads I have gotten at a restaurant."}
{"text":"In the West valley? Craving a burger? Smashburger is your only option!

I had never heard of the place, but after driving past it a dozen times, I went with my gut feeling and checked it out.

The small, simple menu contains no bad options. There are a few specialty burgers, which you can get as a 1/2 pound, a 1/3 pound, or a chicken sandwich. You can also choose your own fries, bun, cheese, and other toppings (fried egg, anyone?).

Like anyone else who lets their stomach do the thinking, I ordered a half pound Arizona burger with Smash fries. After a few minutes waiting in a cozy building with friendly staff, my meal had arrived. 

The next 30 minutes are a blur.

Habanero pepper jack...chipotle bun...amazing guacamole and onions on a perfectly cooked and seasoned burger? Amazing! On paper, having rosemary garlic fries (and a touch of olive oil) with this does not compute, but you'll forget about that when you're shoving it down your face. This was one mesmerizing meal.

If you choke from eating too fast (I don't blame you, you won't be able to focus on anything but your burger), then order one of the beers they have...a limited selection from nearby breweries like Four Peaks and Sierra Nevada.

Someone is bound to argue with me giving this place five stars, but unless they can find me a better burger around here (NOT the Red Robin or Island across the street. Amateurs!), I refuse to go any lower."}
{"text":"The burgers here were really good.  I guess the \"smash\" really gave the patty a nice sear on the outside.  I'm always worried if you smash the patty of the burger, you might dry it out.  But it was very juicy and a bit on the greasy side even but not too much.  But if you are a burger lover, juiciness and a bit of greasiness is what you are looking for anyway.  The sweet potato fries and regular fries were really good as well.  The only thing I think that would make this place better is a better choice of buns, like brioche and pretzel buns just to name a few."}
{"text":"First off...I must say I know they are new and are working out the bugs. My man and I went in there for lunch today because I told him how delicious it was in Denver. I ordered the Classic SmashBurger 1/3 lb and he ordered a bacon cheeseburger with no bbq sauce. I think that order confused the cashier because he asked my man to repeat his order twice....no biggie. 

We sit down and they promptly bring out my chocolate malt which was yummy to the tummy and then my burger follows shortly behind. My portion of the meal was perfect. My man's food on the other hand was a bit off. The cashier didn't get the order right and the poor runner had to bring it back twice (first it came out plain, then came again with just bacon, then it came back the correct way with bacon and cheese). When it came back for the third time...IT WAS DELICIOUS! They were very kind and apologetic about the whole thing. Like I said before....they are new and working out the bugs. We will be back to try it again soon."}
{"text":"Just happened on this place while looking for a specialty store. Menu was basic, easy to understand your choices. Harvest salad was delicious. Burgers moist, great tasting and a really good value. Smash fries tasty and crisp and generous portion. 

Server was cleaning the walls with some type of eraser product and a moist rag. He did not wash his hands before serving us our meal. When called on it he told us he was trained to only touch the tray or salad bowl. Makes you wonder if this behavior would pass the department of health inspection."}
{"text":"I'd rate this a solid 3.5 stars.  Went for our first time for lunch on a Tuesday.  It's a counter-type order place.  You get a number and they bring food to the table.  Drinks are self-serve.  The girl at the counter was very nice and answered our questions about the menu.  We ordered the Arizona smash burger, the All American Smash burger, 2 drinks, an order of smash fries and an order of sweet potato smash fries (which are both flavored with olive oil, rosemary, and garlic, though you can also order regular fries).  Our kids opted for milkshakes.  

The burgers:  My husband thought his was really good.  It had spicy cheese, jalapenos, guacamole and other fixings on a wheat type bun.  I thought my All American smash burger was just about PERFECT.  I ordered it without any ketchup or mustard, so i could really taste it.  It was the best burger I'd had in a long time, just succulent and juicy and with a good meaty flavor.  It was so juicy, I had to use a napkin to clean up after every bite.  The patty had a bit of that nice crust you get on a flat griddled burger...I think they cook the patty in butter, though I can't say for sure.  The soft, shiny egg bun was part of the burger perfection, so soft and pillowy, but holds up to the juicy burger.  Just awesome.  I will likely order this burger every time I go back.  The fries:  Here's why the place gets less than 4 stars.  The fries were a bit of a let down.  They couldn't stand up to the burger.  While okay in taste, they seemed overly greasy.  I wonder if they were heavy handed with the olive oil part of the olive oil/rosemary/garlic flavoring?  Frankly, after the juicy burger, the fries just seemed too rich and greasy to eat.  And I LOVE fries.  I hardly ever leave a stray fry behind, but I just could not bring myself to eat many of these fries.  Next time I'll get plain fries and see if they're better.  As for the portion size, I'd say one order of fries could be shared by two.  One basket is almost the equivalent of 2 small fast-food orders of fries.  The shakes:  made with Haagen Daaz, and super rich and delicious.  The kids loved them.  Service:  Excellent.

Bottom line:  They have AWESOME burgers and okay side dishes.  It's worth a trip back now and then for those burgers.  You're looking at spending about $10-12 per person if you each get burger, drink, and fries.  Reasonable value for such a good burger."}
{"text":"I don't like burgers but I love this place. The food is varied and always so fresh and served piping hot. The grilled chicken is probably the tastiest but the turkey and beef options are also delicious. The fries are so crisp and tasty they don't need extra salt or ketchup. They also cater to vegetarians, not merely by offering a veggie burger (its black bean here) but also with so many customisable vegetable options, unusual sides (eg crispy Brussels sprouts) and salads. The staff at this location are always incredibly friendly and accommodating, a model of what a fast casual eatery should be. We like it so much we have eaten here more than 20 times in the past month since discovering it. Flawless every time."}
{"text":"I wish I was kidding because I used to come to this place all the time when it first opened and it was great! I haven't been to this location in about a year and a half and it feels like a totally different place. This location was ABSOLUTELY FILTHY! No exaggeration when I say that EVERY table had eaten food all over it and the floor...they weren't busy, actually quite dead, so it wasn't like they had a huge rush of customers and haven't had the chance to clean it. The service was embarrassingly bad. I was floored how terrible it was. The two young boys at the front chatted while I came in line and proceeded to curse and laugh for a few more minutes without even saying hello. It was really awkward. Finally a girl came and took my order and seemed really annoyed that I was even there she kept trying to end my order and when I ended the order with a shake she quickly turned around to tell one of the boys to make another, which he groaned and complained about in front of me. The whole time I was eating my dinner, the staff LOUDLY, talked about how gross the food is here and about their lives. It was so inappropriate and a better manager is clearly needed. I will continue to go to the Thunderbird location near my new house because the service and cleanliness is vastly better. What a shame."}
{"text":"Went back to SmashBurger today,  this time with my sweety.  She ordered the \"spicy baha burger \", and the rosemary /garlic fries w /ice tea.  I ordered the \"sin city burger\" and chili cheese fries w /a pbr.

When the order came to the table - WOW - lots of great looking food that tasted as good as it looked. Perfect burgers. The rosemary /garlic fries were excellent as was the chili cheese fries.

My sweety says this SmashBurger is her new favorite burger joint.  She still likes In N Out,  but SmashBurger kicks their ass.  I concur. Tasty,  juicy burgers -- and you can have a ice cold beer with it,  if you want.

I believe Smashburger,  with it's  menu,  it's  atmosphere,  it's  obvious quality - really set them a cut above the other  burger chains.

The tally for the above orders came to $ 21   Really.  Very affordable."}
{"text":"I have never been to a smashburger location this terrible.   My order was wrong 3 times.  The girl insisted that vegi burgers always come with bacon.   Really????  The fries were cold.  The employees all seem completely out of it.   They don't even know the menu.   Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Read so many good reviews, so tried it. Big mistake! Only good thing about it was the people who worked there. Everything (hamburger, salad, sweet potato fries) was SO salty and greasy - just awful. Hot dog was the worst I've ever had. Asked if it was beef and told it was, but it sure didn't taste like it. Very expensive, especially considering the poor quality of the food. Won't be back. Deserves zero stars."}
{"text":"I'm a loyal in-n-out customer but I have to say smash is really really close in beating them. This location has great service and you can also order ahead and quickly pick up. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"OK place, pleasant staff.  Average burger.  Better than the other big burger chains.  But not 5 Guys or In-N-Out"}
{"text":"Finally made it out here after a co-worker had been ranting and raving about it.

I had the 1/2 lb. Sin City Smashburger and the Sweet Potato Smash Fries.

Food tasted great and left me satisfied.  Fair price, fair portion, and the staff was friendly and courteous.  I will come back to try other things from the menu.

I give this place 4 stars because it's just like any other burger joint to me.  It's good and has lots of variety, but I still like Five Guys and In-N-Out burgers better."}
{"text":"They definitely had me at fried pickles!  I just love those!  I enjoyed an Arizona regular burger as well.  The onions were VERY strong and there were tons of them.  I took them off except for one piece.  I asked for haystack onions on my burger and they forgot about them and when I asked they brought me just a small amount :/  This is a great place for a bigger group to go.  You don't have to get split tickets because everyone pays for their own at the register when they order and you still have the convenience of a restaurant type setting.  I will definitely go again but this time I know to say no onions please"}
{"text":"What do you do when you get home and your order is wrong?  You call them to give them the opportunity to correct the problem.  What did I get, and I quote ... \"don't be a dick\".  I'll NEVER go into this or another Smashburger!"}
{"text":"This is a review not for the food as I enjoy an occasional Smashburger indulgence. 

No, this is for this location and staff. I've been to this location three times now. 

Each time the wait has been long. Granted this is a fast/casual place so you expect to sit and enjoy your meal, but people were leaving the evening of 9/20 around 7:30pm because upon getting up to the counter the manager mentions there is a 30 minute wait. 

Begin edit:
I scratched my head but decided to order anyway as I had a soon expiring coupon to use. I sat down and wrote my initial review which I've now edited (see below)

Update: I bumped my review up three stars as once my food arrived I had both the supervisor and another worker come by and make sure everything with the food was satisfactory and that they were deeply sorry for the wait. BTW the wait ended up being about 24 minutes, not 30 as warned. The food was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Good burgers but GREAT sides. I enjoyed the burger i had and the multiple options of buns, sauces & toppings makes me want to come back.

but the thing that really got me was the sweet potato fries, which you usually had to go to a brewpub grill or such to get. 
i'm hoping to try the haystack onions, fried pickles , fried banana pepper rings or the smashfries on one of my next visits. 

the prices are what you expect and parking is a lil' hard to come by if they're crowded but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This location sucks. i actually LIKE smashburger, and the one at tempe marketplace is infinitely better than this one. our food was cold, greasy... and just unappetizing when i came here with my girls. booo."}
{"text":"First time eating at Smashburger. Busy place. Average customer service. Poutine was good. Hamburgers and french fries ok. Little too salty."}
{"text":"So good! The staff is very attentive and courteous. They bring you the food to the table, and they clean after you. The burgers are very good, the meat tastes fresh. I can only eat 1.5 burgers. I recommend the Avocado Burger.

Tip: Until 3/31/2013 there's a buy one get one free burger coupon online. Great deal!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Smashburger often.  Hadn't been there in a while.  Stopped to grab a burger and when I ordered, I was very specific that I wanted the mayo on the side.  I ordered it to go so I sat and waited patiently.  I noticed she kept saying to the guys in the back that she needed a side of mayo for my order.  I very politely told her that I did not want the mayo on the burger, but on the side.  She didn't say a word or even acknowledge me.  When I got my burger home, it had the mayo all over it...actually spilling out of it and it was a MESS! SmashFries were pretty much the kind of fries that have been sitting there for a while. Not fresh at all.  I did call and speak to the manager about the situation and he was really nice about it and informed me that I would have my next burger free when (IF) I decide to go back.  

I hate giving such a negative review about this place because typically we have a very positive experience there.  Just feel like these types of things shouldn't happen.  

Again, the manager was super nice and helpful.  So that is why I didn't knock down the stars any more than I already did.  


This is why I should NOT have cheated on my diet...damn you STRESS! DAMN YOU!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best hamburger establishment I've ever gone too! They make an amazing burger! I am gluten free so I don't have many options out there. They sure do provide many choices for me. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Thank you Smash Burger for offering a gluten free bun, trust me I will be back for more!

The one thing I have learned from being gluten intolerant is that if you want to judge a burger order it without a bun, because if the meat was not seasoned it is not very exciting to eat a burger. There were a variety of burgers to choose from or you could create your own. I tried the Mushroom Swiss and it did not disappoint. Now this is a burger that is juicy and you can't put it down because it was juicy and oozing all of its goodness!

We ordered the Smash Fries and they had  Rosemary, Garlic and Olive Oil and shared them and they were cooked to perfection and were flavorful.  I love fries and these did not disappoint and next time I want the ones with truffle oil. 

What I liked, they have a menu you can look at as you stand in line so when you get to order you are clear on what you want, that is a nice touch.  By the way you can order a beer to go with your burger! I am a fan of the metal baskets for the fries, it is another nice touch.

A few improvements.... The cashier took our order and before we paid she said she would be right back. Another cashier returned and finished our order and explained that the other one was under . It would have been nice if the young girl explained that in the beginning so we were not left standing dumbfounded. I ordered a water and that line needs to be cleaned or something, the water is horrible! This is beyond Vegas standards. A personal gripe, turn down the music, it was loud enough where it is hard to carry a conversation. This seems to be a trend, and if you are alone with your phone it is good, I would not want to come here and share a meal and try and carry on a conversation.  Yes, I am a fan, and Smashburger almost got my  stars!"}
{"text":"Smashburger you do it right! There is a new item on the menu and it is the BOMB! Fried Brussel Sprouts!   Yes you read that correctly. They are fried and have a secret seasoning salt. I would come in here and just order them on their own. 

The Gluten Free Bun, thank you from the bottom of my heart to accommodate GF diets, trust me it is not by choice. I hate lettuce wraps with a passion. So, again thank you. 

The Double French Onion Burger. Mmm mmm mmm!

I shall return!

Thank you friendly staff"}
{"text":"This is our go to Burger place! Service here is great! Love them fries!!!!! If you're around the area go check it out!"}
{"text":"There's nothing \"smashing\" about SmashBurger. 

Let me first mention that combo orders aren't options, so every item you want has to be ordered separately. *red flags*

Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger (regular size): I ordered this with mayo on the side, and I'm glad I did because it was salty. Aside from that the burger was fine without the mayo. The best part was the mushrooms, but the disappointing factor was the \"regular\" size of the burger. It just didn't satiate my appetite, and I engulfed it within minutes. 

Bacon Cheeseburger (regular): This was my boyfriend's order, which he originally put in a request for a \"big\" size, but instead received a regular. The burger's reminiscent  of a Carl's Jr. Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger, but sans onion rings and not as tasty and filling.

Smash Fries: Soggy and thin.

Service - Burgers are ordered up front and delivered to your table. Speaking of which, 
I didn't expect I'd be seat stalking on a Saturday evening. This came as a surprise to me after having eaten here. The burgers aren't even all that, but the place was packed both inside and outside -- to each his own, I guess.  It might be best to take your burger to go or better yet, head across the street to In-N-Out.

Overall - Not the best burger I've had. To me, if In-N-Out is ever mentioned while eating at another burger spot, then the burger wasn't all that to begin with."}
{"text":"Come on! This place deserves better than 3 1/2!
I would give it 4 1/2 actually.
The burger was great! Better than most fast food places! Let's put the price tag aside since this is inside Caesar Palace and next to Gordon's restaurant. 
Service was nice. The cashier was nice and actually talked to me and not acting like a machine.
The fries was the only problem. It is well seasoned, but it was kind of cold and soggy. That actually made a big difference for me. 
But I still love this place. I would definitely go back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"I apparently hold a minority opinion, but I might as well chime in.

On the down side:
The burger was very greasy and salty. 
I love the idea of the veggie frite and they would have been tasty if they weren't so salty.

On the up side:
The bun was kind of uniquely sweet (in a good way) and the lettuce, tomato, and onion all looked very fresh and tasty. 

Though this is a fast food place, a young man offered to refill my drink for me. 

Also, the manager came over and asked how my meal was. I appreciated that he cared about the customer experience. He says that I can ask for less salt next time.

p.s. I'm not surprised that the burger is a whomping 1000+ calories! If you love a good, greasy burger, this just might be your place. I might go back and try the chicken since it sounds much healthier."}
{"text":"So so overpriced, Its the size of a cheeseburger from McDonalds for $10. I get it, its the strip and the food court at Ceasers is an avoid at all cost for me, because its the worst strip pricing   in town. 

Got stuck there, needed a quick bite and knew how bad it was. 

$35 for two burgers, one fry, one coke and one beer. Seriously its more of a slider than a burger. I dont think it really tastes good at all

This is an avoid for me."}
{"text":"I've always loved Smashburger since they have gluten free options. Yes there was only one person working the front counter -- Olivia. She said she would be right with us and as we patiently waited for about 3 minutes she turns around and says you guys have to understand I am the only one here (this was said in rude manner) please be patient. We did not say anything about the wait. As we go to order she interrupts and says hold on.. we don't have any fries. I ask why they don't have fries and her response is your guess as good as mine, I just do what the kitchen tells me. We decided to eat elsewhere. As we're walking out the general manager came up to us and gave us free entree voucher which was very nice and appreciated. This experience is why I stick to 5 guys and get my burgers from in and out! ;)"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. I had the chicken sandwich with mushrooms and swiss, and it was made to perfection. The prices are fairly marked for the quality of food that is served! My children loved the shakes here, the chocolate by far is the best. 

My only problem however is the staff. The young man who took my order was very polite and helpful about the menu, but who ever I'm assuming was the manager on duty was very rude. She was screaming profanities in the kitchen which could be heard from where my family and I sat down to eat. She then proceeded to scream at the young man at the register in front of all the customers. In my opinion that is highly unprofessional. I come from the restaurant business and that is no way to treat employees, but to do that behavior and become so irrational in front of customers is just an awful way for a manager to be acting. I would seriously consider rethinking her employment if you want to have customers have a happy and non profanity ridden experience at this establishment. Her rude manner in front of customers ruined the atmosphere for myself and my family, and I'm sure for other customers as well."}
{"text":"The fact that you can't truly customize the burgers here without getting charged an arm and a leg is what caused me to drop the grade to 3 stars. Although the burger I had was amazing(I forget the name but it had egg, bacon, onion strings, and an amazing sauce) I can't overlook the fact that the prices are much more expensive than CREATE which is literally 2 feet down the street.

The rosemary fries were a great touch but sadly for $2 you get about 10 fries which is frankly a huge ripoff. Although the experience overall was a great one, sometimes you can't overlook pricing. Too bad!"}
{"text":"BBQ, Bacon and Cheddar Burger = Amazing
Classic Burger = Ok
Fries = Ok
Onion rings = not a fan

Overall = Would recommend for burger fans"}
{"text":"The smash fries are so good. The avocado club burger is out of this world, wish it had more avocado. Be sure to ask for some of their ranch, it goes great with the fries. My husband got a bacon cheeseburger and said it was great as well. Overall a great alternative to the usual burger joint. And the staff is so friendly. Aaron was the one who took my order and brought it to me (a to-go order). He was so polite, remembered my name and asked if I wanted any extra sauces."}
{"text":"Love the smash fries!  They are also vegetarian friendly by offering a 'no meat' option or black bean patty instead!  Highly recommend getting a shake too"}
{"text":"Had an awesome Arizona Burger. Husband had the Bacon Cheeseburger. Both were juicy and tasty and fresh. The SmashFries were delicious too! Fast service. Clean place. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"A great burger place usually with fast and great service. It think it is infinitely better than Red Robin. They have a great variety of burgers all with fresh ingredients. My personal favorite is the Arizona burger. Fresh guacamole and jalapenos! Yup!
Their milkshakes are also amazing! The best is oreo or salted caramel!
Give it a try! I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The bacon-mushroom burger and their special fries are my personal favorites! Best burger place in town for me!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever will never eat here again. My chicken sandwich didn't even look like chicken it was like rubber. I have had the food so many times and it was good . What happened tonight."}
{"text":"Good taste, friendly staff. In my opinion a bit on the smaller portion. For the price I'd eat at Bad Daddys instead."}
{"text":"Last night I was invited to Smashburger as a VIP (YAY) and was able to partake in some of their menu items for free. Now me pass up a free meal, hmm NEVER! 

So I mosey on to Tempe after sitting in traffic for about an hour (boooo) but was able to snag a great parking space and made my way into Smashburger. My first impression was that it was cute little place and yes it is a bit small but cute for a burger place. I met up with Christina, who by the way was fabulous. (Thank you Christina for inviting me) and she gave me a menu, told me about the place and let me know that anything I wanted was on the house. Gotta love that right? The first thing I asked her was \" where is the ladies room?'\" In which she informed me that it was actually outside, around the corner as that is how the restaurants are set up on College Ave. If you could have seen the look on my face. WOW! So after getting what has to be the biggest bathroom key ring I have EVER seen, I made my way around the corner to the ladies room. Although it was well lit, it still creeped me out that I had to go around the corner and kinda towards the back. Although it was very clean, still not really comfortable with that but again I guess that is how it is on College Ave. 1 star 

Any-who, I proceeded to order the following food to try out and here they are: 

Chocolate Milkshake - OMG! I don't even like Haagen -Daz ice cream (that is what the shakes are made with) and let me tell you that this was the BEST chocolate milkshake I have had in a very long time. Think, rich, and oh so good. 5 stars 

Smashfries- they are made with rosemary, olive oil, garlic and other herbs. I was a little bummed as depending on which fry I picked up it was either cold, warm, or hot. Not consistent! 1star 

Onion stack - Now I love me some onion rings but I didn't get to try them because when I got them guess what, they were COLD!!! I was so disappointed. How do you get cold onion rings? Double boo!! 0 stars 

Arizona Smashburger- I had the 1/2 lb one and it had habanero cheese, guacamole, onions, chipotle mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun. (I did not have the lettuce and tomato but it comes with that too) OMG! That was one good burger. Nice and spicy, the bun was way to small for that burger but it was so good. A chipotle bun? Who knew! The seasonings that they put on this burger made it really pop. I was thoroughly happy with it. 5 stars! 

I did meet Greg and Kirk, (Regional Vice President and Franchise Owner in that order I believe) and I did express my thoughts on my meal, especially my fries and onion rings. They did offer to bring me out more and apologized profusely, but I declined as I did not want to waste any more food even if it was free as I there was no way I was going to be able to anything else after that burger and milkshake. 5 stars 

Oh and the best part of the night, I got to meet fellow yelper Alexander C. and his friend Erin and I was able to go in the back and smash my own burger! That was very cool! 5 stars 

So all in all, a few quirks regarding hot fries and onions rings, but the burgers were really good. Its a little pricey as well so be warned. They are opening up a couple more in the next few months. One on 99th Ave and McDowell, and one on 20th St and Camelback so be on the lookout. These locations will have wine and beer added as well."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here. And the 2nd time they messed up my order. The cheeseburger is amazingly good, other I wouldn't come back. The menu is pretty confusing how there are no \"meals\". It took  3 tries to get my order ready and my haystack onions didn't come until I had finished my whole burger. The staff didn't seem to communicate well with one another, hence all the mistakes. The have gluten free buns but good luck trying to get one, they messed that up too."}
{"text":"Tried out a Smashburger closer to us after going to the SB Yelp event across town. Our experience at the restaurant was just as impressive on a \"regular\" day. They willingly took our coupons from the Yelp event even though they were marked as being from the location across town. Helpful staff who were all friendly and appeared to be in good moods. Tasty food, all good. I love the smash fries and fried pickles are on the \"secret\" menu I think. The burgers are good without being too heavy, and it is easy to customize what you want. When you don't have time for a sit down burger but don't want to hit McD's or BK, this is a great option."}
{"text":"great place to visit if you want a different burger!!  Rosemary fries are great!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I ate at Smashburger and I must admit that the burgers at this location are not made as good as the first place that I tried on Las Vegas Blvd and Warm Springs.  I had a buy one and get one coupon, so I order both the Sin City burger and the Avocado Club burger.  The burger was very greasy, overcooked and not as tasty as the burgers at the other location.  It also was put together very sloppily and very hard to eat without everything falling out of the burger.  I was quite disappointed.  Needless to say I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"after leaving the mall, my bf said he was in the mood for burgers and shakes. how perfect.. thanks smashburger.

The cashier who helped us was very friendly. We took a little while to order since it was our first time. Smashburger has a menu of cool burgers (whodathunk?). each option can be on top of a burger or chicken (grilled or crispy). they also offer salads (some good creations too!) and sides. 

My bf went with the bacon and bleu cheese one (sorry- I forget the name) with a crispy chicken patty. He also ordered a chocolate shake. 

I went with the avocado melt with a burger (bacon, lettuce, tomato, ranch, avocado). I also ordered fries since the picture looked so good. Apparently, the fries pictured are 'Smash Fries\" seasoned with rosemary and olive oil. My fries were basic with no season. not even salt. I wish the menu explained that better.

overall this is a super cool place for burgers, fries and shakes. I'm glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"Smashburger's are good but shakes are a ripoff! I ordered two shakes and the guy working there pulled out metal mixer cups with a seriously inadequate amount of pre-scooped ice cream. Whoever is loading the ice cream in the shake cups has no idea how big a cup the mixed shake is going into. 
We got handed shakes and the cup was 2/3rd full. Even when topped with whip cream they didn't go above edge of cup.

Then to add insult they put a pointless done lid on top of the cup. The top of the whipped cream spire wouldn't reach a flat lid. 
We asked \"why are the cups only 2/3rd full and they remade them and added more milk to water it down.......really?

For $4.50 you would think a 16oz cup wouldn't be a lot to ask! I have had a lot of shakes at other Smash-burgers and never encountered this.

Thanks for giving us for not giving us what we paid for and when having the chance to rectify it you merely added more milk and watered it down...(only 1/4\" more shake by the way.....still not full!"}
{"text":"Our favorite burger spot these days. We love all the topping options. Good tasting burgers. Fun sides but their shakes are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Old salty burgers, old fries. Waited 15 minutes for it too. Fries were complete grease. Horrible food. Drive thru doesn't work at the location, neither did the menus inside. Most of the tables inside were dirty. Would never return."}
{"text":"I took my kids to this Smashburger on Wednesday night went to order and was told they had ran out of burger so my son went on to say you are a burger joint how can you run out of burger the sad part is the manager didn't even come out and talk to the people that was in line he had the cashier telling  the customer that was in line now on I will be going to in and out you just lost a good customer at Smashburger"}
{"text":"Giving this three stars instead of two because of the other fabulous Smashburgers I've been to around the Phoenix area. Interior was dim and felt musty/unclean (not the vibe you want when you're about to down a burger). Service was okay, but a little slow. Burgers were great! We ordered regular fries, which needed a little more flavor, so maybe go for the Smash fries next time you stop in."}
{"text":"Smashburger has the BEST fast-casual hamburger, period! Their burgers are so delicious and flavorful and there are so many yummy toppings to choose from so you can make your ideal, personalized hamburger (avocado, bacon, cheddar, grilled onions on a pretzel bun... YUM!).

I don't get people who say it's expensive compared to a place like In & Out- of COURSE it's more expensive than In & Out. In & Out is a straight-up fast food hamburger. Smashburger is on the border between a fast food and a restaurant burger; the two cannot be fairly compared!

I ate here a bunch of times when I lived in Illinois and since moving to Vegas, I've gotten to try the Sin City burger (with a couple of modifications) and it was delicious. OH and the Smashfries are awesome. Salty, but awesome."}
{"text":"I had the crispy chicken avacado club. It was ok. I went with the smash fries, and was a bit let down. I just thought that the flavor of the rosemary was a bit much for the skinny little soggy fries & it was weak overall. So for the money spent, Id reccomend Red Robin if you're looking to have a sit down spendy burger experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE SMASHBURGER SO YUMMY!!

I am on a strict diet of the Sin City burger and the BBQ, bacon burger.. With a side of veggie frites and an extra ranch sauce..lol

Omg cooked to order and yummy.
I will say i think they should start removing the excess grease from the veggie frites.

I also love their sweet potatoes fries.
The other fries they offer are yuck.. :/

In the end...
I love this location, it clean and never busy when I'm grabbing lunch.
 RYAN the manager is a doll and is always willing to have a friendly chat while I wait for my food."}
{"text":"I love love love Smash burger. Everything is made fresh to order.

Try the SIN CITY burger it divine.

The buns...omg the buns!!

Must eat veggie frites with yummy ranch.

Eat HERE.. 

Service is quick and friendly every time

That is all"}
{"text":"Love eating here with my kids. There prices are more than fair and the food is like having a family backyard cookout. Delicious."}
{"text":"Usually head to Five Guys for a 'morning after' burger. Couldn't wait until 11am so Smashburger was on the list. Got the bbq, sin city, and cheese burger as well as some fried onion strips (can't remember what they're called). Let me assure it was not all for me, though prob could have eaten them all.

The cheese burger was fresh. I would love it if they had a low carb option like some of their competition, wrapped in lettuce. 

Onion string things were odd. May be good if they went full blast and jacked them up to actual onion rings. 

Woman who worked the counter was very friendly and quick. I'll be back."}
{"text":"After a very long day, we visited this location exhausted and ready to get home. Miranda helped us and was so incredibly friendly, helping us to get the best deal on what we were ordering and thanking us many times. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch with my boyfriend near our jobs and was definitely impressed! Location is great, right off of Baseline and 24th street inside the same complex as Wal Mart, Taco Bell, Jersey Mike's and Chipotle. The restaurant was clean and staff was very friendly. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese salad and picked at my boyfriend's \"smashed\" sweet potato fries. Smashed fries include rosemary and other spices...mmm! The sweet potato fries in general are really good! My salad was awesome, I've had their burger and chicken sandwiches before and everything I have had is great! Prices are a little steep (almost $20 for 2 at lunch without drinks) but good food indeed! Will be back!"}
{"text":"We visited this location around 2:00pm on Sunday. When we walked in, we went to the counter and waited for at least five minutes before we were greeted by the guy behind the counter. He seemed to be preoccupied with making a shake. The line started to fill in behind us but he still wrestled with the peanut butter canister. An employee off to the side (who appeared to be doing take out order or something) told the guy behind the counter not \" to feel bad, but be quicker.\" As we sat down to eat, we noticed several dirty tables. And, the few tables that were clean looked like food and napkins had been swept off the table and left on the floor. The restaurant was a complete mess. It appears there were only three employees in the whole place. In addition, the food just didn't taste that great, either, but it may just have been because our expectations dropped so low upon walking in. We will not be back to this location. Poor service, dirty tables and sticky floors aren't what we ordered from the menu. Epic fail."}
{"text":"My first time at a Smash Burger was at this location on 12/27/14.  I was not disappointed with the Regular mushroom-swiss burger.  First time for fried pickles also.  It was not very busy so service was very good.  The serve yourself plain water seemed carbonated which was nice.
The only negative for me was while waiting out front for my friend a fake homeless child with a box of candy asked me if I wanted to make a donation.  Then she said \"thank you, have a good one and coughed\"  as she moved along."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at this location! STAFF is always welcoming and super nice! Food is ALWAYS delicious! I looooove their franks hot fries!! I hope they NEVER get rid of them! Keep it up smashburger, you're our favorite go to burger spot! :D"}
{"text":"The newest burger joint in South Charlotte located in Stonecrest.  It's a good, quick place to grab some food with your kids.  And I like the fact that they have healthier menu items other than burgers and a lot of options for customizing whatever sandwich you choose (burger, chicken, black bean, etc).   I opted for the black bean burger but they had some good looking salad options too.  The burgers are all huge...like they hang off the bun huge.  You definitely won't leave hungry.  

My only complaint.  When they rang up our bill, it wasn't correct.  When I mentioned it to the kid at the register, he claimed it was right.  We double checked it again once we sat down and called the kid over to discuss it but he ignored us not once, but twice.  He then got the manager involved and the problem was rectified immediately.  

My boys love burgers...it's convenient...and there are other items on the menu I look forward to trying (fried pickles, veggie frites, sweet potato fries, harvest salad).  We'll go back..."}
{"text":"Decent but not wowed. Sin City burger was juicy but lacked some basic flavor profiles. Pretty one note. The fries were bland and that about it. The strawberry shake was good and probably the saving grace to the whole thing. For a brand that has grown over the last few years I may have been expecting something more than decent. 

Would I come here again?  Maybe. Surely wouldn't be the first choice but it wouldn't totally be dismissed. Decent wins over horrid every day."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for early dinner and found the place to be extremely noisy, not from people but the crap music was way too loud. The meal was $19.00 for two burgers, fries and sodas, way too expensive for what you get. The burgers were sooo greasy my wife would not eat hers, the fries are fake potatoes, and the soda machine was broke so we had warm can soday to add to the ice which diluted it very quickly. For half the price we can go to In and Out and get a really good meal without the grease and the noise. We won't be back that is for sure."}
{"text":"They can be good, they can be bad,  depending on the time and day. Luckily my burger was made well and the rest of my topings were fresh the only downside to  my visit was that the place was a mess,  messy tables,  messy floors they really need to pick up after each rush it was really dirty but besides that the food was good."}
{"text":"Do not go to this location. The staff is incredibly RUDE!! A worker named Jaila said I didn't have to be such a bitch when my food order was done incorrect and I had asked for it to be corrected. I will never go to this location again! And I will make sure everyone I know doesn't go to this location either."}
{"text":"Very indifferent and disappointing.  Judged worse than McDonald's by everyone in the family except one.
They had no lettuce.  I asked for extra pickles and tomatoes on my black bean burger several times. It had two pickles and one tomato slice.  The bean patty tasted like bitter mashed potatoes.  The spicy chicken sandwich was rated as worse than jack in the box,  no joke.  The beef burgers were really fatty to the point of being watery.

The family won't go back at these prices.   It wasn't horrible or bad but for the money we will do Chicago hamburgers up the street."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and haven't had a negative experience. They're typically fast. Only thing that gave them only 4 stars is that when i ask for extra garlic in my Smash Fries, not only do i get a weeeeee little bit more garlic but my fries end up in a puddle of oil. It's not appetizing. Please incorporate a separate buttons so that when a customer asks for extra of a certain SINGLE item, it doesn't include extra of everything. I will say that they did well today, no grease bucket included."}
{"text":"I'm here for another one of my favorites Classic Big Smash burger... and trying the haystack onions instead of fries.. #foodfatty #foodporn # these onions are awesome"}
{"text":"Staff is great.  Restaurant is clean.  The food is fresh and good but WAY too salty.  If you are a salt lover you will love these burgers.  I feel there should be a lie salt option.  The smash fries are delicious."}
{"text":"This place has a very poor manager running it. We have used the online service twice and both times I have walked in and they state the order was not in their system. 

I waited for the manager to get the order on his screen and yelled across from the grill area that it was the way that I put the order in. Then after he started to make the food he then had to come over to me and show me on his phone that it said 6pm that the order would be ready.  Amazing service.

Also if you are going to be working a fast food store they should not have someone that is sweating a ton delivering and working over the food. I physically saw him wiping his face with his hands.   

There are way to many other options to have to return to this specific Smashburger again."}
{"text":"I was on my way back home to Los Angeles  and wanted something different other then your normal burger joints then came across smash burger, the name alone sounds great so I walk in and the a/c was great compared to the weather out side ,so you Automatically grab a menu then walk to the counter they have three different fries you can get and also different sauces you can choose ,the place was so clean almost new the music they had was new age and the service was great I hope they make one in LA ,I Definitely would go again you won't be disappointed ..."}
{"text":"3 stars given for all the hype that I had heard about this place but didn't live up to it. Burger is decent but definitely not a place \" I Have to Have\" again. Staff was nice and establishment was clean."}
{"text":"It's in the name. They like to smash burgers! The menu says they use 100% certified angus beef. The burgers are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order. If you prefer chicken instead of burgers you can find that here too.

Yesterday I picked up my favorite the \"Avocado Club\" (crispy chicken) for lunch priced at $6.99 and it was delicious. The all white meat crispy chicken has nice flavor. The sandwich had bacon that was freshly cooked, not microwaved or something questionable. Also the sandwich has lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing on it. I love the fries! I'm not picky about how skinny or fat my fries are as long as they are good and these fries paired with the garlic they put on them makes for a nice side to your sandwich or burger. The \"Fried Pickles\" priced at $2.29 are not good at all here. I have tried them twice now and they are way too greasy. 

They offer a few different salads if burgers and chicken aren't your thing. Also on the menu is the \"Spicy Black Bean Burger\"  for you veggie burger eaters. For dessert (like you have room) they offer Haagen-Dazs shakes! They range in price from $3.99 - $4.29 and you can get classic vanilla, chocolate and strawberry or you can go for a oreo or nutter butter shake. The \"Nutter Butter\" is super tasty. There is a kids menu and they serve Coke products (yay coke) and beer. 

I must admit that I only ever come here with a coupon. I signed up for the e-mail club and for my birthday I get a free shake and throughout the year I get coupons for BOGO on entrees. I always present my coupons before I place my order and have never had an issue. There is a offer with your yelp check-in for 10% off any SB meal, but they wont let you combine it with a coupon you already plan to use so I haven't even redeemed mine yet. Nice lunch spot especially with a coupon."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers at cheap prices. Sure, they're more expensive than fast food places like McDonald's and Carls Jr, but the quality is light years ahead of that kind of crap. We got the 1/3 lb. Classic Smashburger ($4.99), the 1/3 lb. BBQ, Bacon & Cheese Smashburger ($5.99), Smashfries ($1.99), and a Chicken strips kids meal ($3.99).

Both burgers were delicious and used fresh ingredients. I love the egg buns... really good texture. The smash sauce on the classic was tasty... like a mix of mustard and mayo. The fries were an oily, soggy mess. My kid was happy with his two chicken strips and heaping mound of fries.

Service was good. The guy at the register was really friendly and happy... which was a nice change of pace from your typical fast food or chain restaurant employee who hates his job and acts like you're an inconvenience. It didn't take long (maybe 12 minutes) for the food to come out.

It's a good family restaurant and a good alternative when you don't want fast food but don't want a full blown sit-down meal with waiters that'll take hours."}
{"text":"Good Burger, a little greasier than I like, but still very good tasting.
I also like the Smash Fries.
Nice to have a fresh made Burger, not something thats been Nuked."}
{"text":"The burger itself was pretty good, the meat was seasoned and cooked all the way through. The tots were good too. I'm pretty disappointed though in the amount of avocado I got. I ordered a bacon avocado club, you would think that when ordering a burger with avocado in the name it would come with more than 1 slice..... I guess I thought wrong though."}
{"text":"I almost feel like withdrawing my last review but I will let it ride because although I've had a disappointing change of heart for my own reasons (being a vegetarian), it remains a solid burger join for the meat lovers of the city. 

Since my last review,  Yelp had a smashburger tasting and high level executives from the US came up to talk about thier products with a few of the yelp elite.  They were told I was a vegetarian and made a point of asking what kind of vegetarian I was and explaining thier menu as it applies to me - I knew this already but I got a kick out of the care and attention they took to my personal diet (Ovo-lacto in my case).  They explained they do not have anything on the menu that is \"vegan\" and wanted to make sure they talked to me before serving me anything.  

This weekend I found out thier cooking oils all contain a mixutre of oil that includes beef fat.  Ughhh...  I don't know a lot of vegetarians that consider the use of beef fat vegetarian and yet this topic was not something they flagged and told me about after taking such interest in my diet.  Although I didn't figure this out on my own before trying things here and would be sad reguardless,  I think it makes it worse that a store manager from the ne and a handful of executives didn't manage to let me know about this issue when they had my captive attentions which makes me rather irrate.

Those veggie frittes(aka a side of juliene carrots and green beans)? NOT vegetarian but rather for meatatarians that want some veggies on the side.  I hope I'm not the only one that finds that insane from a product design perspective from a company that's TRYING to lure in vegetarians by offering the blackbean patty (a smart decision with 10% of the population now calling themselves some kind of vegetarians).   How much taste and or cost savings is lost to take a cooking oil from a vegetable/beef hybred and go to 100% vegetable oil?

Smashburger: trying to appeal to vegetarians?  Try again..."}
{"text":"I hate this place they always mess my food .. last time here thats for sure. I ordered with no onions yet i get one with onions. And the portions are small too."}
{"text":"My family and friends love smashburger! We were hungry and decided to visit the food we love at Ceasers property. This was the absolute WORST service we have ever recieved! My daughter works at a smash in our hometown, as well as a few of our friends.

First the girl scoffed at me when I ordered my regular meal... my bad I didn't realize it was an express menu. 

Second scoff came when we tried to use our gift card, again sorry for not knowing it was a franchise.  

Third...30 minute ticket time. There we 2 people ahead of us in line and another 2 people waiting. With everyone in our party fully understanding how long it takes to prepare Smash's menu items...this was beyond insane! Along with how many people were in the kitchen, it shouldn't have been a difficult meal prep. 

Fourth, when my daughter's CYO meal came completely incorrect, she tried to bring it to someone's attention. The kitchen staff walked by her 5 separate times, not even acknowledging her. Then when she finally spoke up and got someone's attention, they debated with her what she ordered. Finally remaking it, wrong again. Third times a charm for them I guess,  but not for me!

We have a pretty bitter taste from this experience! Sad since someone in our family eats there at least once a week! If I could give this store a 0 I would! We tried to laugh it off and make the best of our time, but we ended up wishing we were at a corporate store. Our Boise market really does have us spoiled I guess!!"}
{"text":"This is a great option if you have a group of people who have special food needs or wants.
They have delicious burgers but you can build your own meal to suit your own style.
I substituted the burgers for a chicken patty!
It was so delicious and tender. 
The tots and fries are very greasy!
We actually had to blot the oil and it was still too much.
I tried my first gluten free beer here and it was very good!
The high stars are mostly for the staff 
They were friendly and cool and helped give this place its friendly and carefree vibe."}
{"text":"Good toppings and bun. But a burger at a non fast food that can only be cooked well done?  This needs to be an option if you want more stars for an $8 burger."}
{"text":"I've given this location about 4 chances and I just don't think I'll be back, because the quality for the price you pay just isn't there.  Every time we've gone here there are issues with the orders... small things, but annoying.  Also, the fries are ALWAYS lukewarm.  Staff is nice, but it's just meh.  Not bad, just that there are lots of other places I'd rather get a burger, sorry."}
{"text":"The food is good.  I can't help getting frustrated with the service every time I've visited. They don't have any attention to detail."}
{"text":"Best burger in the fast food category in Las Vegas. Very fresh ingredients, served hot, and nice clean atmosphere.  Much better than Five Guys."}
{"text":"I went online to order tonight.   The website seemed easy enough, but took awhile.  Once completed I received a confirmation email and off I went to pick my order up. 
   When I got there it seemed they had got my order,  but \"It hadn't gone through \" Whatever that means.   So they remade my order and back home I went with order in hand. 
     Once I opened the two bags neither mine or my wife's order was right.   
            So having a written email certainly didn't help them get my order right.   The burgers were good, but I suggest you go in to order as there online system sucks.    Ron"}
{"text":"Awful food and service. The girl behind the counter was rude and wouldn't let me finish a sentence without cutting me off. Food was gross. It was undercooked and so greasy. There was grease everywhere, by the time we got home across the street all the napkins were soaked. I couldn't eat the burger. Only thing good was the shake."}
{"text":"We decided to try this burger joint today, after one of our friend said that he heard good things about it.  They have beef and chicken burger, sides (potato/sweet potato fries, onion rings, fried pickles, veggi fries, and chili), hot dogs, and for the healthy concious, the salads. When you order the sides with the meal, it is one buck less.  This is what I had:

-Baja Burger (very good, the way the patty is smashed made it quite tender, and crispy on the edges)
-Beefy Chili (was yummy, Tobasco would have made it super yummy)
-Sweet potatoes fries tossed in olive oil, rosemary (was a little burnt, and the olive oil and rosemary was not a good match, to me at least)
-Haagan Daz Caramel Shake (taste like plain vanilla, they might have made this wrong!)

We had six other people in the group, and we came to the consensus that the burgers were good, with one person making a bold statement that now he doesn't have to go to In-N-Out.  One of my friend who doesn't eat beef, ordered the chicken club salad, which came in a gigantic bowl.  She enjoyed it very much.  The staff was very nice.  I would definitely go back and eat again if I am near that area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner on a Saturday. I went with the BBQ Bacon burger with a side of the regular fries and my wife had the Carolina burger. We quickly found a comfortable booth and waited for a little under 10 minutes until our burgers were served. The burgers were pretty good, a little on the salty side, but still delicious. The fries reminded me of steak & shake; thinly cut shoestrings, just the way I like them. 

Overall, burgers & fries were tasty; but for 2 burgers, an order of fries, and 2 soft drinks the total was a bit over $20"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!!

This is the first time we had smashburger and it's funny it happens to be in Toronto! We ordered the Jalepeno BBQ which was sloppy and falling apart because of all the sauce and fresh jalapeños. Just the way I like it. I would get that again.

Also tried the smashfries which was...okay. It really needs to be made more fresh. Not even as good as jack in the box garlic fries. And the other gripe I have is the size of the burger. For the price, it needs to be just a tad bigger than the size of my palm lol"}
{"text":"Ill start by saying we love SmashBurger! We've been to a few different locations and have always been very pleased, with the exception of this location. We've been here three or four times, and what strikes us each time is that while it is rarely busy, many of the tables are dirty. The drink station is dirty, as well. Today, the table we chose has empty salt and pepper shakers and no napkins (which are typically on each table).  While the service is mediocre, the food has at least always been good."}
{"text":"Smashburger is a chain, but it's one I can honestly say I like. 

First off, the burgers are pretty tasty. I don't like the smash-bit (I want every drop of fat I can have, please!) but the meat is so juicy and tasty I can forgive them. Plus, the variety of options for each burger (whether doing a build-your-own or a specialty burger) mean you could go twenty times and never have the same burger. My favorite is the Spicy Baja. They are definitely not the best, but as far as chains go I think they are - at least better than Five Guys and DEFINITELY better than a McDonalds or Burger King (then again, a two-year-old could make a better burger than McD's and BK.)

The sides are pretty awesome too - the rosemary smashfries are the best chain-fries I've had yet. Even the sweet potato fries are tasty, which surprised me since I tend to not like them. I love sweet potatoes, but sweet potato fries are usually soggy and gross. These were as crisp and flavorful as their regular potato counterparts.

But what really makes me like Smashburger is the localization. They've always had an Ohio-only burger and Ohio-only sides and sauces (the BBQ sauce is unique to each location, for example) but most recently they have teamed up with Christian Moerlein to have a burger-and-beer pairing menu and to serve exclusively Moerlein beers. They've earned a thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome but don't expect to pay McDonald's prices. The Arizona burger was awesome and don't waste your time on a 1/3lb and get a real burger 1/2lb. The garlic smash fries are a hit but the portion is kids meal size. Had the haystack onions and veggie frites as well. If the portions were bigger on the sides, this would be a strong 4."}
{"text":"We got the half-pound Sin City burger and the Veggie Frites.  The burger was delicious.  The meat had a lot of flavor and the toppings were great.  The bacon had good flavor, but I wish it had been crispier.  Veggie Frites were really tasty.  I was expecting them to be covered in batter, but they weren't (which was fine with me).  Some of the asparagus pieces were a little woody, unfortunately.  Prices were a little higher than your average burger joint, but the quality and service were good.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"If only I could get the SIn City Burger (with no sauce, please) in San Diego!  That burger rocks.  I like the fried pickles, chili, veggie frites, and heavenly chocolate shake.  I don't like the fries (put chili on them instead of that extra oil and I'd be a fan).  I wish you could get the fried egg a little less done.  I'll be back again and again, though."}
{"text":"We've been to the W. Lake Mead Blvd. location several times and wanted to try the newest location (which is closer to where we usually stay when we're in Las Vegas).  We brought some friends and family with us (who had never had Smashburger before).  They liked it so much that we went twice during our trip.  Yes, Smashburger two days in a row.

The Good:
+LOVE their Sin City burger (fried onions, bacon, and a fried egg).  Too bad I can't get it at Smashburger locations in other cities.
+Brother-in-law was totally into the Spicy Baja burger
+Service: these employees tried really hard to make sure we had a good time (in a very sincere, not-annoying way).  One even offered to take our cups up and refill them (at the self-service beverage station).
+The meat: well seasoned, well cooked.
+Fried dill pickle chips: probably won't get them every time, but we all liked them.
+Delicious chocolate shake
+Easy parking
+They have Splenda (but it doesn't matter since I don;t like Tazo tea)

The Bad: 
-The fries: very greasy.  Not into the whole adding olive oil after frying thing.
-Iced Tea: we don't like Tazo iced tea.  Personal preference, just don't like the taste of it.
-Why no seat covers in the bathrooms?

Overall, this location is off to a very good start."}
{"text":"Today it was kinda kid screamy but usually this place is decent if a bit expensive for a burger ($14.05 with veggie fries and a fountain sofa)."}
{"text":"You can't beat the quality and service at Smashburger. Their menu is unique and off a variety of burgers and chicken sandwiches. I travel to this side of town for work and love when I get to stop in and have a fresh made smashburger. They even have a patio to dine outside as well. I would recommend this to anyone. Combo meals range around $11-$13 if you go big and get the smash fries which I would recommend. I would take a smashburger over five guys any day of the week...not that five guys is bad just comparing price range to quality."}
{"text":"The first visit the truffle fries were so good we ordered a second order of them as well as another whole grain bun with mushrooms on the burger. Everyone is friendly and helpful each return.

The soap in the restroom dispenser smells so medicinal I can't enjoy my food. This is a major turn off. 
Except the first experience eating here, we find it too salty and for these two reasons sadly I won't be back."}
{"text":"Well I guess my karma came back to me last night, at least that's what I would like to think. I pulled into the parking lot of this new Smashburger to meet my daughter so we could carpool to Savers Thrift Store for their half off Labor Day sale. We were to meet at Elliot and 101 and this was about the only place close to the freeway with a parking lot that was easy to find. There just aren't a lot of businesses around here--no gas stations or drugstores etc. This turned out to be fortuitous.

I parked and waited for my daughter to arrive. When I got out of the car to wave to her to show her where I was, a nice young man, who I later found out was Mike, asked if we were planning to come in to Smashburgers. I told him that I had planned to ask my daughter if she wanted to grab a bite to eat there and he said that actually they weren't opening until Wednesday but tonight they were having their Friends and Family Night starting at five and if we would like to join them we were welcome to!  I told him that we would love to if we got back in time and made sure it would be okay for my daughter to leave her car there while we were gone . He said that would be fine but suggested she park it at a little further back in the lot, so she did.

We got back to the area around 6 and went into the restaurant, which was fairly full but still had a few tables left, went to the counter and I ordered a Smashburger with goat cheese, arugula lettuce, cucumber, and Apple cured bacon with a side of their Haystack Onion Rings. My daughter got her favorite, a bacon cheeseburger, with a side of fries.   They gave us each a cup for a drink. I got some vitamin water that was acai and pomegranate flavored. Periodically a girl walked around with a tray full of sample size cups of milkshakes.  During the course of the evening we were able to taste vanilla, Oreo, and chocolate.  All were creamy and good.

The burgers were delicious with what was obviously real meat, no filling, and all the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  The French fries I thought were just sort of average but the onion rings were absolutely heavenly. They were thread thin and crispy and so delicate they practically fell apart when you picked them up.  I loved them!  I would come back for another burger and more of those onion rings at the drop of a hat. The burger was cooked well done, which I know they have to do, though I do prefer mine a little pink in the middle. But the texture and flavor of the burger were perfect.  There was no gristly chewiness, just good quality meat . I would say the service was good though they were naturally very busy and didn't get back to check on us very often. However we didn't need anything other than a second sample of milkshake so we were fine.  They even brought us an extra hamburger by mistake but let us keep it and brought a to go box, which I thought was very nice.

All in all it was a very nice evening. We enjoyed ourselves immensely, got a big kick out of getting a free meal that was delicious, and I plan to go back.  I can recommend this place with a clear conscience.

Back in the area February 2017 and head look forward to returning to this place. My daughter and I stopped in one evening before we went to the Tempe Cinema to a movie and we're again very happy with our food. I was impressed with the good flavor the hamburger had and the haystack, thinly sliced fried onions were as delicious as I remembered!"}
{"text":"Worst burger experience ever. Took forever to get our order (30 mins) and when it did arrive it was wrong. They corrected it ten minutes later and when is got to us the fries were greasy and the burgers were too salty"}
{"text":"There is something wrong at this place! We went for burger to go and they made a mistake and left us waiting for 30 min. When we asked ( very politely asked) the waitress, Lisa, what happened she snarled at us and said that there was another patron with the same name. We were perplexed as we had also given our last name initials. The order finally came but the waitress let it sit under the warming light and made her manger come and finally deliver it. Really nasty experience. The kicker occurred when we got home and there appeared to be small bits of plastic stuck into the burger. 
Avoid this place at all cost!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, long lines. But the price is right. When i was there the cash registers broke, so the manager gave all the customers a free smashburger coupon. Pretty cool if you ask me."}
{"text":"What a treat to find Smashburger at the Rio in Vegas.This was our first visit, and we were not disappointed!  Friendly, fast, and fabulous food, consisting of hot and delicious burgers plus a myriad of sides, make this place a winner! I highly recommend the veggie fries... carrots and green beans, tossed in olive oil and seasoning....superb. For healthier dining options, this is the place! We will probably grab something here, today!"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service! To top it with bomb food! Seriously I wish they had more of these in the valley.  This place reminds me of fuddruckers. If you havnt tried one of there burgers then you are missing out! this place is addicting!

You will eat here and wonder why you still eat at burger king or jack in the box. This place puts them to shame!"}
{"text":"Ok, so here's the deal...

$12 lunch better be good.  Place is cramped.  Waitstaff arbitrarily asks you to tell them if you need anything.  You must get up and find them if you need anything which defeats the purpose.....

Went here three times during Mon-Fri lunch.  3 of three times one could not find fork/knife.  I mentioned this to the manager on the first visit.  The next two visits netted the same result, no fork/knife....

Got money burning a hole in your pocket?  Want a fast food lunch and have the order taker fish for a tip?  This is your spot!"}
{"text":"Got the spicy Baja and smash fries.  Burger was good had to ask for extra jalapenos as I like my food SPICY, I  like that they're fresh jalapenos ;) smash fries were good but had quite a bit of rosemary. All in all good :) fellow yelpers I LOVE spicy so any recommendations for the Vegas area would be welcome :)"}
{"text":"What a cool place. I had the 1/3 lb Arizona Smashburger (5.99 habanero cheese, l&t, onions, guacamole, jalapenos, chipolte bun) and really liked it. I'm not usually a burger person and this was messy to eat (my bro was making fun of me for eating the trimmings off the burger first because they were falling out) and - oh that's why it's called smashburger - it's flat and even has a crust. You just have to try it.. hope you like it like I did.

Veggie frites - innovative side dish of carrots, asparagus and green beans with ranch dressing were SO good and I am happy to see veggies on this menu.

My daughter enjoyed her Grilled Cheese kids meal (3.99 including fries and drink.) 

My recommendation: Go! Check it out. And if you can save room for the Haagen-Dazs milkshake (3.99) and let me know if it's as good as it looks - I want to try it next time.  NO WI-FI here."}
{"text":"Such mixed feelings! The service was friendly, but they gave me a bun instead of lettuce. Not a big deal, they just brought me some lettuce. My burger was tasty and filling. 

The problem really is the odor! Something is wrong with their grease trap, I think. It smells like methane in here. 

A few times, I've asked to sub avocado for the guacamole that comes in the Baja salad. They almost always charge extra, which is annoying. I didn't ask for extra, I asked for it instead, because their guacamole is not good.

So, come in and get your order to go. The food is good!"}
{"text":"Burger was JUICY AND DELISH!! 
What is even better is the crew they have at the Peoria / 27Th Ave location; lead by Team Captain Chelsea.  She and her crew got a BIG SMILE on theirs faces to greet you and went above and beyond to make sure you are well taken care of with out you even have to ask.  Common courtesy is rare these days but the team here has it ! Much props and KINDEST THANK YOU !!"}
{"text":"Service is good, I was and usually always greeted with a smile. I can't complain. 
 I love there chicken salads, with jalapenos!  And that salad dressing is amazing. 
When I'm in the mood for a burger, I do like there burgers as well."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place on Maryland Pkwy, and always wondered what it was about, but just went on my way. Then I have friends on FB that was always talking about it. 
Well for Memorial day they were offering free burgers to Military persons, so I told my husband, hey lets go check it out, it's free! 
We already peeped out the menu on line so we knew what we were getting. OMG! This is now our favorite burger place here in LV. It had alot of flavor, tasted old fashioned. The buns were so soft! I was really shocked at the flavor. I got the Baja spicy burger, but with american cheese! Just awsome! My husband got the All American burger, and he really liked it. We also got the rosemary french fries.....no big deal on that flavor, next time I will just get the regular fries. 
Ohhhh yea, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Feel like I need a shower, from the inside, when I leave this place.  Kind of pace myself to make it near a bathroom when I head home.  I know... It's a burger place and not a steakhouse.  However, with all of the burger joints in Vegas - this ranks just above the big corporate chains."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy my meals from Smash Burger. My location of choice is the one on Lake Mead but the Sahara location is closer to my home. 

Now, I know they took fried pickles off of the menu BUT they still make them if you ask. They're $2.29, normally they're delicious. Lightly breaded and fried to perfection. I also ordered the Spicy Baja burger which was good. I can't complain about that. The fried pickles were absolutely HORRIBLE!! The worst I've ever had anywhere. They tasted like the cook poured an entire container of salt in the batter. The batter was SOOOOOOO thick and chunky. I couldn't believe it. Next time I'll go to the location on Lake Mead, the last time I was there I enjoyed my order of fried pickles."}
{"text":"My first and second time to this restaurant where excellent.  Great Food , great beer,
one of the best hamburger places you can choose Period.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fast service.  The workers here are great and even funny at 
Highly recommend this location..  Parking is a little tight though.  The bathroom is the cleanest fast food bathroom I have ever seen.  Nice to see for an eating establishment."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  The Calgary burger was missing a little something, but I figured out it was salt!  Salt makes everything better.  I was shocked when the buffalo fries came out - they are shoestring fries...  but don't despair, they still tasted amazing - I will be back for these alone.  Thanks Smashburger for coming to Calgary!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent burger, enjoyed the buffalo chicken as well, but it's the milkshakes I return for here. Thick, made with hard ice cream and fresh flavorings and served in soda shop glasses with the extra in the tin mixing cup left at your table. It kind of feels like you get two shakes for the price of one. 

I just wish they'd stop using the narrow straws that collapse when you try drinking such a thick shake and the berries plug up with the small hole. I have literally considered bringing my own straw."}
{"text":"Use to love this place but they messes up our orders last 2 times stopping by. Last straw was when we got there and doors were closed because computers were down. No more smash in my future."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time. Made fast, hot, and fresh.  Better than all the other locations. The staff is really awesome as well, polite and considerate."}
{"text":"Amazing smash fries and sauce. I always get the Classic Burger and it never disappoints. There have a lot of amazing burger choices. The staff here is great and awesome service. The prices are good too. I definitely recommend this place if you want a nice burger - high quality burgers."}
{"text":"We have been there a few times and had great food and service time. I've lived in Vegas since 1982 and the are by far the best burger joint I've seen. My favorite is the Sin City Burger. Good food, great service and a clean friendly environment."}
{"text":"This location is underwhelming: over-peppered and salted burgers that are, no surprise, over cooked. Counter staff slow and inept, soft drinks out of syrup. Clearly there's a management issue at this location. 
Disappointing, because this is the best $3 milkshake you'll ever have and we had just discovered, and absolutely loved, the Hyde Park location -- a burger juicy and fresh enough to rival Five Guys. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My fav current hamburger joint. Rosemary fries are soooo good. Normal or sweet potatoes. Hamburgers are so good!! Onion strings always seem overcooked/burned though."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel for a good burger, I always make a stop to smash burger. The fact that you can create your own custom burger is awesome. The only downside to this place, is that they used to have chili cheese fries and they no longer have it on their menu, other than that, the burgers are the best in town."}
{"text":"As always Smashburger was a good choice. Although I was a little disappointed that I didn't get the opportunity to use both my rewards and coupon , I quickly got over it after biting into my more than delicious turkey burger. (no animals were hurt in the posting of this review) There I sat attempting to enjoy my burger as I watched my lady wrestle with what she described as an usually awkward bowl. (A little jewel for the lettuce eaters) We sat enjoying our meals and watched as people began coming in in droves as if word had gotten out that the regularly mailed BOGO coupons had hit the post office (frugal folks they got you too) They ordered, everyone smiled, kids jumped, people cheered and all was well. Check em out if you're on this side they never disappoint. 

In closing I'd like to add after finishing her salad my lady leaned back balled up her napkin and shot it into her awkward bowl as if she were Thunder Dan himself....."}
{"text":"Lets start with  $10 for a burger fries and a soda. I think the burger will need to be pretty special. My burger was not. Allow me to back up a bit. The physical appearance of Smash Burger by NKU in Highland Heights looks great clean and contemporary. The order taker very helpful and courteous. 

Things went down hill from here. I ordered the small Blue something burger recomended by the order taker and some string fries. When my order was delivered to the table in a short period of time I was struck by the thiness of of the burger pattie and the bland tastlessness of the fries. The whole experience reminded me of the old Hardee burger chain from the 70s. Not what I was looking for. Shouldn't a $10 burger be thick juicy and sloppy with chewy tasty fries.

I might give it another try but not a third. Thanks"}
{"text":"We have tried this Smashbuger location before and it was delicious, but not so much anymore. The only item that tasted good were the smashfries. The onion rings and bugers were so overly salty that I could not even enjoy tgem. It was like eating just salt by itself. I couldn't even finish the food. It was just too unpleasant flavorwise. I wish they would go back to how it used to be."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and chicken sandwiches, a wedge salad that rivals some fine dining establishments, and delicious milkshakes - what more could you want? Smashburger is considered \"fast-casual\" - order and pay at the front, grab a number, and wait for the food to come to you. With four small children, this approach is a must for us. 

Smashburger officially opens on Monday, but my husband and I and our tawdry assortment of children had the opportunity to grab a quick bite there today. I wasn't sure what to expect - I have had less than pleasant experiences with other \"fast-casual\" restaurants in the Charlotte area, so I was trying not to get my hopes up - little did I know what deliciousness awaited me! Smashburger reminds me of a similar place that my kids used to love in Cleveland - Fatburger. Whenever a burger and milkshake craving would strike, we would pile in the car and head to Fatburger. Certainly not a weekly visit, but a reliable go-to place that always hits the spot. (Don't tell my Cleveland friends, but I can safely say that Smashburger is better... shhh...)

When six people eat out together, there is a beautiful opportunity to try a little bit of everything. My must-try food is always fried pickles and these were great - crunchy dill slices with ranch dressing - maybe just a little on the too-salty side. My son is an onion ring afficionado (Smashburger has onion straws - light and crispy), my older daughter is a french fry girl and the youngest two will grab whatever comes in front of them! My husband ordered the mushroom swiss burger, I tried the cheddar bbq - both were great. Not too big - I enjoyed the burger and the amazing smash fries that I ordered with it. (Smash fries are lightly seasoned with salt and rosemary - yum - try them.) My son wanted a chicken sandwich and he tried the club - the chicken breast was really, really thin. He devoured it but I was able to sneak a bite in, it was very tasty. My daughter always orders a salad and I really couldn't believe how beautiful the side wedge salad was - and it was on the side menu for $2.99. Wow.  

We left satiated and cannot wait to come back! We had a tiny taste of the milkshakes but I look forward to enjoying a large one when we return. The butterfinger milkshake will be calling my name next time... I recommend you check out Smashburger - I think you will love it!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch! Have been here multiple times though and always have a great experience! Great food, casual atmosphere, good prices, and excellent customer service. 

Today I got my favorite BBQ bacon cheddar burger with sweet potatoes fries. Everything is cooked fresh so it comes out super hot, melted cheese, and amazing! Their fries are also always super fresh. If you like sweet potatoes fries then you will love them!! They serve most burgers on an egg bun and it's super good. Always very fresh and super hot. Really adds great taste to the burger. I have gotten the buffalo burger before and also a create your own and it's all delicious. 

Its at a great location with a ton of tables but can get busy during lunch hours so I usually try to beat the rush. The restaurant is also very clean and the staff is always walking around asking to pick up your stuff when your finished. I'm amazed at the customer service here! Definitely recommend if you want a hot tasty burger."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Smashburger and although I liked the burger, I was not blown away and I didn't love the fries.

I had a BBQ cheeseburger (minus cheese) on a chipotle bun. There was tasty BBQ sauce, crisp pickles and I barely detected the onion strings (I think that's what they're called).  The beef was cooked well, juicy without being greasy and had a good taste. I also enjoyed the bun which tasted fresh and had a slight spice to it.

I enjoyed the burger, but I think I will try a different type, perhaps the classic one in an attempt to truly appreciate their burger prowess.

I saw that the fries are of the shoestring persuasion, which I generally pass on, so I got the spicy fries which are dry dusted with Frank's Red Hot spice.  This definitely added flavor, but did not make me love shoestring fries. They were however crispy and plentiful.

In summary, I will return and I can appreciate why everyone loves Smashburger, but I will need to return and try a few more items.

Also note, I came at 6 PM on a weekday and they were very busy. However I only had a short wait. The staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"By far my favorite burger today. Big burger is perfect size, plenty of options for toppings, and all of it high quality. 

Don't need to say any more, it's my first choice for a burger."}
{"text":"All three for got sick after eating here. Ordered black bean burgers, fries and a milk shake. Will definitely not go back here again."}
{"text":"Great for late night. Great burgers. Really hit the spot. Open late. Good fries too."}
{"text":"Good burger. Can't complain. French fries were good too. Service was very very fast. Wen't at like 3pm on a Sunday. I'm sure this is a popular place on a weekday."}
{"text":"One of those nights where the question \"where we going to eat gets tossed around\". Driving back from the west side of town and needed a burger fix.Came to mind that smashburger was on the way home.
-First time and won't be the last time.I had the Sin City which has Fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun. It was cooked perfectly, full of flavor and that sucker was big. I only got the1/3 LB burger, the 1/2LB would have killed me.
-I had a bite of my wife's Buffalo chicken sanwhich. Very juicy piece of chicken with some Red Hot and crumbled Blue cheese.. Delishhh
-Smash Fries were tasty and the fried pickles were different, in a good way."}

{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(230/365) \"The Tom Ryan Special\"\"

We decided to use our free burger certificates we received at a Yelp Event a while back. I Remember hearing about Smashburger owner Tom Ryan's favorite burger at a past Elite event, so thats what I went with.

It was a Mushroom Swiss Truffle Burger topped with a fried egg, so with the certificates, it only cost a dollar for the egg. SWEET! If you decide to check Smashburger out and you love all things truffle, this burger is worth getting.
I think this may have topped my other favorite, The Sin City.

If burgers aren't your thing, Smashburger offers some tasty salads too!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"After realizing that web ordering was not working for over half hour decided to drive there and WAIT. 
I notified Tyler and hat I had tried online and no good and also called the store and no answer. His reply was \"oh well\" and a disrespectful smirk. Wow!
Also noticed the manager texting on his phone the entire time I was there. No wonder!"}
{"text":"The managers, cooks, and cashiers here are wonderful.  Very attentive and get the orders right every single time.  Had a bad experience at the BJ's Bar and came to Smashburger to finally eat.  The manager not only ensured that we got our food quickly, the order was correct.  (I know this shouldn't be an issue, but read my review of BJ's and you'll know why).  The manager even threw in an order of fries just to be nice to us.  Food was great.  Juicy burger with fresh toppings."}
{"text":"I was really craving burgers, fries and a shake... After watching a movie with the fam, my Sis said I needed to try smashburger.   She knows I really like In and Out, Culver's and Five guys.  I ordered the Arizona, the Hubby had the American, the kids had bacon cheese burgers.  The customer service was wonderful, the girl who took our order really knew how to be helpful, fun and super nice!  As far as the food, it was good.  There isn't anything \"wrong\" with it at all.  I could taste the quality beef in the burger, the toppings were very good, the bun was good.  But it was good, not great.  I would chose a Five Guys burger over smash, I would chose a Culver's burger over it, I would even chose an In and Out burger over it.  Especially because the fries were not good, and the shake (yeah, how can you go wrong with a shake) wasn't very good either.  I will go back to try the chicken sometime, but if I want a burger, there are other places I would rather go..."}
{"text":"Had lunch today
French Fries tasted like they were re- fryed from 
yesterday 
Rest of meal OK
No one asked if everything was OK
Management needs to step up"}
{"text":"Smashburger reminds me of a.. upscale Carl's Jr, the seats and decor are levels ahead of Carl's Jr.

I ordered the Sin City burger since it has egg, and recently I had Fukuburger's tamago (which also has egg), so I wanted to do a comparison of egg burgers. Honestly the Sin City burger was way too salty, after finishing it I downed a liter of water. The bun was different, in a good way and the patty was tender. The 1/2 lb burger @ $6.99 was a fair price, but the Tamago at fukuburger ($5) is a better value for a less salty version. 

The smash fries were good, when you add them onto a sandwich it is only $1.79 and you receive a fair amount. 

I haven't had anything else on the menu, but I would stop by here for a burger if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome service Mindi greeted us and took our order and of course she got me with the Garlic fries which were amazing! Super sweet girl. Ryan was amazing as well He was very attentive and called us by name before our order was even up! Good service you guys!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Smash Burger I've visited. I've been twice, and both times, the staff has knocked the ball out of the park. The food is excellent and prepared correctly, and the staff practically falls all over themselves to be polite and helpful.  We went once at noon on a week day and it was empty, and once on a Friday night and there were only two other parties so it will be interesting to see if they can survive in there but we will patronize whenever we can!"}
{"text":"First timer at Smash. I got the jalapeno burger and it was awesome. I like the flavors you get with smash burger, it's unlike any other. I'd have to say this, along with in & out, are my favorite places for burgers. I also got the sweet potato fries which are pretty great too. Additionally, I LOVE that they have honest tea - an organic tea that is lightly sweetened. By far the best tea around. The only issue I had was the manager wasnt that friendly and acted bored as hell."}
{"text":"Was one of my favorite fast food restaurants, but today they said \"we took too many orders and the wait is 30 to 40 minutes.\"  Didn't tell me that until I was in line for 10 minutes.  Even if they could serve me all the tables were not cleaned.  Poor management has struck another good place to eat!  You would think their regular customers would be more important than a big order from Albertson's Grocery store or for a party.   Really, if you can't handle the orders and serve you regular customers don't take them.

Have been back several times, they are not making me wait in line anymore.  Some normal ordering screw-ups but overall I think they are doing a much better job!"}
{"text":"Too overpriced for what You get. In a competitive burger world it'll be hard to come back"}
{"text":"Been to the one on Sahara and would give that location a 4.5. However, this location is lacking either management or overall service. I ordered and the cashier had to call someone else over to figure out how to place my order. They immediately make my shake, soI tell them it'll melt by the time the meal comes out plus i have to drive it home. She puts it back in the freezer. Then I hear someone yell \"no call ins\" Guess they were busier than they can handle. I see the manager waiting for orders at the counter and she tells a cashier \"well i have 2 new guys in the back\" Something i really didn't want to hear. She checks my order and realizes they didn't sub the sweet fries. She gives it back, calls my name and I ask \"so i can be sure this is correct since you already sent it back\" She assures me. I get home, i'm missing the sauce for my burger, the bun is not wheat and the shake is 1/2 melted.\" I used the bathroom while waiting and it was filthy. WHen i first arrived there were only 2 tables full and maybe 2 or 3 outside already eating. It wasn't so busy for me to understand the messed up order or dirty bathroom. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Newer business in the area and they have the most delicious rosemary olive oil fries and tasty classic smashburgers!"}
{"text":"I have to commend one of the worker's that was working 04-03-18.  I believe he was a manager, his name was Trenton.  He is such a great employee!  He was friendly, smiled at every customer and I just cant say enough good about him!  He is truly an asset to that restaurant!"}
{"text":"If Itzel is working the register turn around and leave because she is one of the most rude people I have ever met! We were new at smash burger and because we had a couple questions she immediately became annoyed."}
{"text":"I typically enjoy Smashburger but i will not be visiting this location again any time soon. The dining room is DISGUSTINGLY FILTHY. The walls are dingy with dirt, spots, spills, shoe prints and fingerprints. Wallpaper is ripped and peeling off the walls. The carpeted areas look as if they havent been vacuumed iThe booths?! They look as if they have never been cleaned since the day they were installed. I was sitting across from my son and the color/pattern of the fabric was so dirty that parts of it looked black. It's supposed to be red. And the plastic \"window\" like dividers between the booths are covered in risidue. Also, i realize this is hard to mitigate with people coming in and out but there were flies like...everywhere. Staff is friendly and i saw them regularly cleaning the tables...on one side of the dining room anyway. But omg people this place needs a serious deep cleaning!! Two places that should hands down always be clean are the restrooms and anywhere you prepare and/or eat food!!! I didn't go in the bathroom because quite frankly, i was horrified enough by what i saw in the dining room!! If i go to smashburger again it will be an alternate location and only if they are in better shape. I couldnt exactly enjoy my meal when all i could think about was whether or not my next bite was contaminated. Totally gross."}
{"text":"i dont even like burgers. well mediocre burgers. i do sometimes like fancy burgers. i didnt have high expectation of this place. but i liked it! i tried the mushroom swiss burger & sweet potato fries. yum!

i love!!!! how they have their iced tea dispensers. i think thats my fav part. and i love the concept of ordering like how you do at a fast food place but having the staffs coming around to check up on you. i thought that was really unique."}
{"text":"I REALLY like this place. The burgers are excellent and it feels \"sorta\" fancy when it really isn't. Prices are a little high but worth it if you don't mind the extra 2-3 bucks. Lots of choices for burgers but not overwhelming :)"}
{"text":"To be honest I wasn't expecting this place to be very good. It's one of the few food spots open late at the Rio Hotel so I expected at best frozen burgers. I was pleasantly surprised to begin with the courteous service.  It was late (or early in the morning lol) and we wanted somewhat smaller portions so we ordered the kids meal with a cheeseburger. The two nights we came here the employees were courteous and helpful with our orders.  After placing our orders they brought our meals to our table and after tasting the burgers we realized this place was really good! I'm a big In-N-Out fan but this place was comparable in quality.  The fries were also good as they were thin and crispy with just the right amount of salt. They had fountain drinks and I was happy to see they had Vitamin Water as an option, as after a fun night of partying I was thankful for some good liquids to rehydrate with lol.  This spot is conveniently open until 4 am, tastes better and is more reasonably priced than the sports bar at the Rio.  I am still impressed with how friendly and patient the staff here is, as I can imagine all the drunks that they get to deal with night after night.  We were celebrating our last night in Vegas and my cousins bachelorette so it was cool of the employees to be cool with us as we were definitely with a high amount of energy lol. Shoutout to Danny who shared he liked to box, maybe we'll see him boxing professionally one day. :)"}
{"text":"Went here hoping for a big yummy burger but found that the burger was comparable to McDonald's.... Little disappointed. The fries were delicious though which is a plus. Plus the fried pickles are yummy."}
{"text":"Of course everything is expensive - you're in Vegas at Caesars. Smash Fries are awesome but I got regular when I ordered the other. Too tired and it's too crowded and loud so forget it."}
{"text":"I didn't think the food was very good. Also it was overpriced. I wouldn't recommend ever going out of your way to eat here!"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale from out-of-state, and were planning on trying In-N-Out Burger. We saw Smashburger first and decided to take a chance. This place blew us away; they have quality burgers and sandwiches at essentially fast food prices. A delightful meal, indeed.

But the thing that struck us more than the food was the store's manager, Jared. This guy was the kindest, most professional, hospitable and personable dude we have ever met. He was all over the store, wiping tables, bringing over orders, polishing the soda machine, stocking the straws .. and thats all in the 20 minutes it took us to eat the food.

He heard a lady across from us talking about how she almost fainted from the heat outside and he was considerate enough to ask her if he could get her some water. Jared is a freaking super star! If I had my own store, I'd bring this guy in to train all my staff.

The food makes this place great, but Jared's service makes it truly something to write home about. If you want to try Smashburger, the Frank Lloyd Wright location is where you'll get the full experience."}
{"text":"Buns taste like sweet bread.  On a burger?  Ordered a mushroom burger and it had mayo bleeding out of the burger.  Taste wasn't great at all.  Fries were mediocre at best.  Staff doesn't seem to excited to be working there."}
{"text":"It's really quaint place and it is nice to see something in that spot in the strip mall.  I was really excited to try this place after being tired of In/Out and wanting something gourmet but also delicious.  It's a little bit more expensive than going to a normal fast food place, but it is worth it in terms of taste.  I got the Sin City burger which has all the things I love, breakfast in a burger + onion straws.  I love eggs and bacon on burgers, and the egg was cooked decent.  A little overcooked for my liking (I prefer over easy), but it's not exactly a restaurant I would assume cooked eggs to the specific likings of costumers.

Downside, although the burger was tasty it was oily.  Oilier than most burgers I've had.  It didn't take away from the taste, but I know when I'm eating it that I'm probably digesting more calories than a normal burger, which makes you feel more guilty than normal.  Aside from that I also had sweet potato fries which were really good until I got to the bottom and the last fries were too oily for consumption. This place also gives me a small vibe of dirtiness.  It's not filthy, but I felt filthy in there for whatever reason.

All in all, I'll definitely go here again, but it won't be something that I'll definitely need on a regular basis to fill my burger needs."}
{"text":"I saw this place the other day when I was at GNC next door.  Sign said it was going to open on the 21st so I went in for lunch today.

I had a build your own 1/3lb burger.  Butter bun, cheddar, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle.  It was an ok burger.  The veggies were fresh and crisp.  The meat was sort of thin and cooked well and was larger in diameter than the bun.  I also had a strawberry shake which was pretty good.  Over all the food was good enough I would stop in again if I was in the area over the other options for a burger at that intersection.  But not good enough to go across town for.

They did a complete gut and remodel of the space which previously housed a deli.  They also added a railed off patio area.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  They are fast casual and the food came out fairly quick.  The sandwiches are served open with the hot stuff one 1/2 the bun and the cold stuff on the other half so everything is still fresh when you get it.  They came to check on me part way through the meal and cleared my plate almost as soon as I finished my burger.  They seemed pretty well versed in what to do for a place that has only been open 3 days.  They were not very busy but no place I ate lunch this week was."}
{"text":"Every once in a while a fast food establishment goes above and beyond. The manager here DR. Carrie Wachsberger (a real DR, degree and all) has always provided me exceptional service in a friendly manner. She  makes sure that the kitchen takes the upmost care with allergy orders and ensures that my food will be safe! I would say that this is my favorite location in town because of the care that is shown to customers with allergies and intolerances to food. I also really like the food! I usually get a CYO (I love that you can customize!) burger with a gluten free bun and veggie frites. I love having the option of vegetable fries, and they're yummy to boot. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The best burger in the Trilogy area. The service was great and all staff members were very friendly.
One large order of their hand cut fries is enough for 3 adults.
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Son and I were headed to see a movie but being a bottomless pit teenager he was starving and in the mood for food, and Smash Burger was the place picked!

Honestly, this was my 1st time at Smash Burger, so I was shocked it was fast food, I always figured it to be a sit down restaurant, idk where I get these ideas from.

The menu is simple and easy to follow. I went with the Arizona Smash burger, mainly because I saw it had jalapenos on it, um YES please!  I also parried mine up with rosemary fries that to me sounded good.. My son ordered some chicken sandwich, when I heard it was chicken I lost interest, this boy just picked a burger place then ordered chicken smh, haha, and he got sweet potato fries.

We found out seats and waited for the food.  Still not quite sure what he ordered, but it too had fresh slices of jalapenos on it, in which he turned to me and asked what exactly are those,,WHO IS THIS KID????? It's not his 1st time around jalapenos, must have been too hungry that his mind was slipping.

The Arizona Smash burger had habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo & fresh sliced jalapenos and it looked great and the flavors were good too, but the bun was lacking, which to me, if you don't have a good bun, you don't have a good burger, also dangit!!!!! This is the 2nd place in 2 weeks that I have encounter shoe string fries!! WHAT IS THE FASCINATION WITH THESE FRIES?? They are not grown up fries, these were little bitty potatoes who aspired to be thick like steak fires but no got picked and fried when they were still so small haha.  They shouldn't be called fries, but other than it being shoe stringed, they had good flavor, even the sweet potato were all right.

When we were finished, we went to dump our tray, and were quickly told, no no we got this. That was pretty cool I thought. Great customer service for a fast food type of place."}
{"text":"I got a coupon from work and I came here to use it I was so excited to try it for the first time, I looked it up on yelp and even tho the reviews weren't all that great I still went since I had a buy 1 get 1 free coupon. I got there, told the cashier I had a coupon and and it wasn't until after I paid for my order that I realized he never entered my coupon that's not the problem tho. The problem is they couldn't just give me my money back bc apparently that was a problem all they could really give me was fries because they had no ice cream or chicken and I'm not even sure if they really even wanted to compensate me because they asked me if I wanted something instead of assuming it was the right thing to do. The food was good overpriced but it was good... I will not be back. :("}
{"text":"I stood in front of two counter people about 5 minutes; neither one acknowledged me, made eye contact or offered anything. I just got off a flight and was really hungry for a hamburger--this would have been my first at Smashburger. I went next door and had tacos instead."}
{"text":"I love this place and so do my kids.  They have the best burgers and fries.  I really like they way they season the burgers.  Another bonus is the bun, it is excellent.  I think it is tastier than Five Guys and Freddies.  The staff is super friendly too.  I suggest everyone try it."}
{"text":"Placed a take-out order for several hamburgers for lunch and it turned out great. Hamburgers tasted great the fries were fresh got extra sauce and ketchup.   Had to drive 10 minutes to get to the location and the food was still warm and tasted great.  Even had a vegetarian black bean burger and the vegetarian person that ate it said it was fantastic.  The computer ordering system is a pain in the butt to use if you were going to order multiple meals. If you order too many it may give you a time after the lunch hour.  Shawn, an employee there, went above and beyond to assist me in placing the order online and making sure when I picked up the order the next day, that it was on time and everything was correct.  Also, while I was waiting for my order, Sean worked hard to get other customers in the restaurant orders out quickly and accurately.  He is a valuable asset to this restaurant.  I really appreciate his professionalism and customer service."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by and have a burger with tasty fries before you check in through security. The burger is smashed, meaning that if you are not careful it will tend to break apart and fall from the bun after the first bite.  Also, don't forget the napkins because it is VERY juicy!!! Missing a star because it needed more smash sauce in my opinion."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going to the opening of this new location. I had no previous experience with SmashBurger, but I'm always looking for something new. My initial thought was how cute the restaurant is. It's kind of in its own little nook in the far corner of Cotswold shopping center. The staff were all very friendly and though they were crowded, the food was served quickly. 

I ordered a classic SmashBurger with sweet potato fries. The burger itself was a good size, flavorful, and quite juicy. The egg bun was a nice touch. I will probably customize my burger a little more next time, but wanted to see how the classic would stand on its own. I was not disappointed. The sweet potato fries were fresh, not soggy and had the lightest dusting of sea salt. I'd give the fries a 3 out of 5. 

All in all, this was a good first experience and I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I'm a virgin to Smashburger. Apparently, they have several locations in Vegas and LA; who knew?

I ordered their truffle mushroom burger. The portion size was actually small (palm size), but surprisingly packed with flavor and juicy. What they lacked in staff, made up in flavor. 

They literally had one cash register open, and one person getting the food orders ready.  Surprisingly efficient, but still took forever to order since you had to stand in one line and wait your turn. 

The menu is at the overhead counter. Unless you had perfect vision, and/or 7 feet tall, you wouldn't be able to see the menu and decide ahead of time until you got to the counter. This just made the line go so much slower. 

The prices are not too bad. Two burgers, two fries and one sweet potato fries came out to $31+."}
{"text":"I tired they chicken smash burger.... WOOHOO!!!  LOVE IT!  Crispy chicken (not too think, not too thick) but perfectly crispy.  I ordered the build your own:  Egg bun, crispy chicken, mayo, and swiss cheese.  HELLO MAMA!  The smash fries were good.  The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Some reason the burger was good but not like the other location I have been to.  The burger was just not as juicy.  The fries were good.  The cashier was talkative and sweet."}
{"text":"The first time I tried Smashburger, I wasn't expecting a \"chain burger\" to be so good. In fact, I went back a few more times to make sure it wasn't a tasty fluke. My burgers took about 5 minutes each to arrive, but were worth the wait and tasted much, much better than any fast food burgers you can get in 2 minutes. I left the last visit thinking out loud that Smashburger is the \"Starbucks of fast burgers\" because their customization, options, and consistent execution are where they really shine. 

The burger patties themselves are good - not the best I've ever had, but a tasty, solid option. Their avocado club burger had fresh cooked bacon and what looked like a half an avocado on it. The  bbq, bacon, and cheddar burger was sweet, smoky, and salty all at the same time. The truffle mushroom swiss burger is on par with what I'd expect to eat at a much fancier farm to table place. Their (very skinny) fries are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic and come in multiple variations.

If you don't see something you like on the menu, customization is the name of the game. You can order custom toppings, sauces, breads, or even sub out the burger for chicken or a black bean burger. This is the first fast burger place I've felt like I can order my food in any combination available and be fully satisfied with the results.

Update: Stick with the burgers, I tried the chicken and it was a sliced patty that was dry and overly peppery."}

{"text":"Showed up at lunch and ordered a shake. The lady at the counter said, \"Dude, all the shake material is put away now an I just can't make one right now.\" Being the chill guy I am, I said ok and asked for a fountain drink. Then she said the carbonation was broken in the soda machine! My mom and I got our water cups and sat down. My fries came out cold and burger dry and well done. To top it off, AS WE START TO LEAVE WE SEE HER START TO MAKE A SHAKE FOR HERSELF BEFORE HER SHIFT ENDED!!! She glanced back and saw my mom and I looking at her and she didn't seem to care at all! 

I have been going to this location for some time and the service has been going downhill ever since they opened. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Koi Poki, Rubios, Pei Wei, or anywhere except this place."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars,  I would!  Crappy customer service. The front girl was very unhelpful. We were new to Smash Burger and she could care less. She turned around and began working on something else. And it wasn't even busy. No thanks, not interested in spending 25 bucks here. Turned around and walked out."}
{"text":"The staff is super helpful and friendly.  I always get good service when I come into this restaurant.  The food is delicious as well.  I usually get a salad with the black bean patty and it is AMAZING.  The portion is big too.  I'll have to attach a picture next time!"}
{"text":"Love the turkey burgers!  The food is good and they are quick.  We went at a busy time last weekend and still got our food very quickly."}
{"text":"I always considered myself a promoter of this wonderful establishment. Until that fateful day last week...

It all started with me making the always difficult decision \"what do I want for lunch?\" I discussed it with my work friends who would be joining me in 30 minutes when their lunch break was scheduled. I zipped on over to get my smash on, I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich on white, buffalo rub fries, (with extra ranch of course!) and the Oreo shake. I sat down and waited for my food, after about 20 minutes and being patient (I noticed they had a huge on line order) I inquired about my food and when I would be receiving it because I had to go back to work. The response I got was \"ok\". 

My friends arrived after I had waited 45 minutes! Still no food! I asked them to bring me my food back to work. They did, but I was given the grilled chicken sandwich on wheat... And I only got 1 thing of ranch! 

So basically I waited way too long for my food and left the building with out even receiving my food! Then had to eat the WRONG food cold after my friends were able to bring it to me. It's fine that they were busy, I just wish they would have communicated that to me so that I could have chosen to go somewhere else on that day and returned to smash burger on another occasion. Now, I don't want to go there at all, if they ask why I might just say \"ok\""}
{"text":"Worst location to get service at. 
I had to work @ the forum shops for a few hours today early morning & between jobs at 2 boutiques I had some time to try and grab some fast breakfast. 
Boy did I make a mistake trying to eat here. 
After noticing that the smash burger was the only place open early besides the coffee place, I ordered a breakfast burger. 
I received a receipt and a vibrating pager and the lady at the register (Genell) was very pleasant and welcoming. 
I sat down to write up some paper work while I waited. 
After realizing that others were getting their food before me and they were here after me. I checked my receipts time stamp. 20 minutes?!?!? no way I thought, since they were literally empty and all they were selling was breakfast burgers. 
I asked Genell where my order was and she walked over to the cook and they were both puzzled as if I had just asked for the impossible. 
When I saw the cooks pissed look as he slipped on his latex gloves on his face, that's when I decided to just get a refund of the order and the tip I added. 
After having to wait for (Pedro) the manager to come & authorize the credit card refund I asked him what went wrong and he had nothing to say but \"can I get you some food?\" Nah, I'm good. I'm not trying to receive anything for free and in bad terms. 
All I wanted was some quick breakfast and not a bunch of BS. 
:/"}
{"text":"First time visitor at Smashburger. The décor gave this rather small establishment a big boost. The parking lot is basically missing. The location holds a good number of people but there is VERY limited parking. The burger menu was pretty basic (LOL). You choose your burger: beef, chicken (grilled or crispy), turkey, or black bean. Then you decide which way you want it dressed from that menu or of course completely craft your own starting with the bun choice. Since it was our first time we went with a classic smash with bacon and sub the American cheese with cheddar. The other burger was a bacon avocado club; the only regret is I didn't request cheese. We tried the original fries and the sweet potato fries. Both were pretty good. Nice and crispy outside and mushy inside. There was an option to \"smash\" them by having them tossed in rosemary, garlic, and olive oil. We may try that the nice time. Since we don't have smashburger in Winston Salem, we will definitely have to return to Charlotte or visit the Durham location. ~ $12 will get you a nice burger dressed as you like with a side item and a drink."}
{"text":"It is in a random location, way off the strip. 

+1 delish garlic fries
+1 really clean inside
+1 great prices
+1 Bacon cheeseburger is THE BEST

I wouldn't make a special drive for these burgers, but it definitely a great place for a good burger."}
{"text":"I was driving past Harris Teeter and I was struck my this aroma that flooded the entire area. I was new to Charlotte and had never been to smashburger. I'm glad that I decide to order takeout. It might be odd that I come to this place just for a chicken sandwich. The buffalo and blue cheese, grilled chicken sandwich is phenomenal. I know this is a burger joint, but trust me when I say that the chicken sandwich is worth paying $10. I also enjoy great french fries which Smashburger's has. The Smashfries, which are coated with rosemary and olive oil, are some of the best fries that I have ever consumed. Just as a side note: make sure that everything is correct in your order because accidents happen when business is booming. Eat here if you have not!"}
{"text":"Smash burger does not let you down. I get the CYO big burger with grilled onions habanero cheese on a chipotle bun and it was hot the ground beef was fresh and I truly enjoyed the burger thoroughly. I like the fact that it is made to order and I do not feel sick after I eat it. 

The smash fries are a hit, the Rosemary and Oil give it a wonderful taste. It is also great because my wife doesn't eat red meat and they have a black bean burger as well as sweet potato fries. If you are looking for a good burger check out smash burger."}
{"text":"I tried them again today. The food was good, none of the previous problems. This time, however, they got my to-go order wrong (no cheese no onion for dietary reasons) so I had to drive all the way back. They replaced it with a cursory apology but did not offer anything for my trouble. Hmmm, I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"Wow... this is a good burger.  And this Smashburger location has deep-fried pickles!  Dangerous combination.  

I really liked the simple lay-out.  You walk in, order at the counter, sit down, and they bring you your food.  Once you dig in, you get to enjoy a juicy, delicious burger with fries of your choice.  All is good!  Only problem is, it's the type of meal that makes you wanna curl up and take a nap for the rest of the day. lol

It's like a gourmet burger, but for much better prices.

See ya there!"}
{"text":"The name of the girl that took our order as shown on our receipt was Sahar. We got the sense she was doing us a favor by taking our order. We ordered 3 combos, of which, we didn't get our fries for 1 of the 3 combos. For 1 of the other combos, we ordered a shake (in place of the soft drink realizing we'd pay the difference) which she forgot to enter. One of the burgers was supposed to have chipotle instead of bbq sauce, that didn't happen. A separate burger was supposed to be a double, and that didn't happen either. Lastly the fries (smash fries) were absolutely drowned in oil. We realize the smash fries are oil/garlic/rosemary but this was just overkill.

Look, Smashburger makes a helluvah burger and this experience is the 1st negative one. And of course we're all entitled to a bad day. I'm not demonizing these guys but believe this had to be said. This was on a Friday night, 9p-ish."}
{"text":"O.m.g Spinach goat cheese salad had the BEST dressing! Reminded me of a cab sauv wine. Idk what the flavor was from but it's very unique here. I loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently tried out Smash Burger.  When I arrived there was only 1 person in front of me already being checked out, no one was behind me.  It literally took 20 mins to check the guy out.  The cashier (jacob) had a LOT of idle conversation with the guy.  I was holding my 2 year old daughter who was asleep.  She weights about 30-35 pounds.  After awhile I started motioning let's get this moving, she was getting heavy.  When I was finally checked out there was a long line behind me.  I told the cashier 20 mins is too long to wait when it wasnt busy.  I told him he should have had another cashier open (there was another cash register).  As far as the food it was ok.  In all honesty In n Out has better food, cheaper prices, and I can't ever remember waiting 20 mins to order at In n Out - even on a busy weekend.  If you want to pal around with customers become a bartender!  People want fast food to be...fast!  I will never go there again - it's a long drive, bad customer service, ok food, high prices.  In n Out for me!"}
{"text":"If I lived here I'd be a regular customer! The burger patties are so flavourful my mouth is watering just writing this. 

As a first timer I paused in front of the menu to figure out what to get. There are pick your own topping burgers and some burgers which have select ingredients. They also have chicken and other options. I could not decide, although I narrowed it down to 3 when asked the cashier to tell me what was popular. She suggested the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger which I hadn't noticed. It sounded good and I'm really glad I ordered it. Not too much BBQ sauce, great applewood smoked bacon topped with haystack onions (thin, coated onion rings) and just the right amount of melted cheese on a soft, fresh egg bun. 

She also explained they don't have combos - it's all ordered separately. I'd read about the smashed fries here so I asked for those. Shoestring fries tossed in olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Sooooo good!

Wanted to order the Saskatoon Berry shake, but went with a bottle of water this time. Next time, for sure!  ;)"}
{"text":"Smashburger is 5 star pick for me. The main thing about their burgers are they always are cooked fresh, never frozen, and the ground beef is the leanest ground beef you will find anywhere. It's on a quality level with Bachi Burger. I like Smashburger slightly better than five guys and fatburger"}
{"text":"Smashburger!! I give these guys a 5 stars. This location is always clean and neat when I go in. I like the burgers because they are made with lean ground beef. Try the Big BBQ Bacon Smashburger"}
{"text":"This used to be the best burger. They made some corporate changes lately with digital menu boards in their locations. At the same time it seems like they eliminated the salt/seasoning mix they cooked in when they smashed the burger. The intense mix of flavor was what made it great. This is still a good burger. It seems like the must use really lean ground beef. Now they are just in the mix with five guys burgers and fatburger. They also added bottled beer to the menu."}
{"text":"While Smashburger's customer service has always been outstanding, the quality of the food at this particular location is wildly inconsistent. On at least two occasions, my wife's Avocado Bacon Club has come out cold. Once we arrived home only to realize it didn't have bacon.

The fries are a constant issue. They are always warm at best or cold at worst -- never hot. I don't understand how food that is purported to be \"smashed fresh\" can come out cold when the In N Out Burger right down the street always gives me fries that burn my fingers out of the bag.

Today was the last straw. Once again, not only were my fries were cold, but my daughter's kids meal cheeseburger wasn't even hot. I don't get it. Why should I pay double what In N Out charges? The answer is that I shouldn't. And i won't."}
{"text":"i would give this place NO stars if i could. WORST customer service i have experienced in a long af time. found a BONE in my chicken sandwich, and when taken up to the manager, i told her the problem and her response was: \"well i'm sure there's not anymore in there\". YOURE KIDDING ME RIGHT?! then proceeded to pluck the chicken bone out of my hand before returning to help the next customer without washing her HANDS. bye forever smash burger. you and your employees SUCK."}
{"text":"Once I decided to switch this from a possible weekend burger choice to a work lunch choice, this fit it perfectly for me.  I like how they let me choose the bun that I want for my classic smash and if I ask for a side of mayo or anything it's brought out without hesitation.  The wait is quick, the place is clean, the menu is not that complicated.  Most importantly the burger has really great flavor for the money spent.  Perfect for lunch when the last thing I want to do is think, at least too much.  

Smashburger you are a smash.  Now how trite is that. lol."}
{"text":"This was was my first visit to smash em up, bash em up burger.  The staff was very friendly upon taking my order and was really good about saying about how long it would take for the food.   I had the classic smash 1/3 pounder and it was good, except it was not done quite enough.  I found it surprising that they didn't ask me how I liked my burger cooked.  For $10, I thought they should have asked.  The food was hot and tasty, I just didn't find it visually appealing for the price.  For a couple bucks less I'd rather go to Culvers.  The decor is minimalist and feels very corporatized.  My friend who suggested the place asked if they actually grilled their burgers and we found out they use 80/20 ground beef.  That was also a bit surprising but then they seemed a little on the greasy side.  I'd come back again, but seems like these places are a dime a dozen.  This one does not come out on my top five burger places."}
{"text":"YELP 100 - 4/100
This place was really trash. $15 for an unseasoned burger and a side of over seasoned French fries. I stopped here at like 3 am just thankful to see them open. I've driven past them in LA but never bothered to stop; Smashburger ... it's on!

Me and my hungry belly stroll up to the counter and place an order. The ordering process was quick - no problems there. I waited around the corner where they call out orders. I got a smash burger with cheese and added an egg, I also got the rosemary seasoned fries.... Let me just ask, who serves a burger with a fully cooked egg on top? That defeats the purpose. That messed it up for me right there... I don't even have to go on about how unseasoned and the unappetizing the meat was. 

Don't do it ..."}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious! I always order the Avocado Ranch Black bean Burger and Smash fries. I LOVE French fries! Today I ordered the classic burger and bean burger. I'm not a burger fan, but they're Burgers are bomb!"}

{"text":"I think there are 4 mushrooms on my mushroom swiss....not good smashburger. And a mess up by the shift supervisor, made a kid go without a meal while the rest of is ate. Not the best customer service..."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. Their burgers and veggies are always fresh and on point. Never once have I came in and been disappointed with the quality of food. I came in on a very busy Saturday rush and Xavier, one of the managers, was keeping the dining area clean for everyone and also running out orders like a boss. All with a smile on his face! On top of that they even had a very clean bathroom, which isn't typical for such a busy day. This place is always a go to for me."}
{"text":"Located in the Rio across from the Chippendales show. We went there for the first this past winter and really liked it so when we came back, we made sure to stop by the place again. Their burgers are great the fries are awesome! If you're at the Rio, check it out."}
{"text":"/Food is still good but the place is continuing to go down facility wise. It is not being taken care of.  Bathroom is borderline filthy. Food on the floor, ketchup on tables and walls, lights have bugs in them. This Smash Burger is going downhill, soon I will stop going because I will be to grossed out to eat there. On the good side the burgers and chicken sandwiches are great. Try the new spicy cowboy!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go back again! We waited 25 minutes to be handed someone elses order & the burger looks like a mcdonalds kids cheeseburger with no toppings!! $25 for crap food!"}
{"text":"Hands down best burger joint with best service. It's been a while since I have experienced great service coming from Orange County, but this place is quick, friendly, and will wow you with their burgers!"}
{"text":"Multiple attempts at Smashburger and their burgers have been VERY greasy every time. Only positive thing about this place are their fries. Hot, fresh, and crispy!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here and my All-American burger was a little dry and had little flavor. Fries absolutely sucked, mainly because they were cold and soggy. I think I experienced the \"inconsistent\" service that many people are talking about. The main thing I didn't like about this location was how absolutely filthy the floors, tables, chairs were .. really, everything was gross. Even the door handles had ketchup or mustard or ... something .. on them. (I didn't look too close.) Would it hurt to clean up a little to keep all the layers of trash and stuff down? Eat here at your own peril. I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I have been here once and it will most likely be the only time that I'll go. The fried pickles were very salty and not good. Everything was very pricey so I'd advise if you're thinking about going just be prepared."}
{"text":"Drove 1/2 hour to pick up my son on Mothers Day last week,  and we decided on this location of Smashburger because I had never been to one. We ordered 2 burgers and side of olive fries.  Place was pretty empty. Younger people running the place.
My sons burger arrived, guac/bacon/bigger beef pattie etc. Oreo shake. I ordered plain burger with cheese. He was done with his meal, mine never showed up.
I do have to say they were very apologetic. BUT, I don't get to spend a lot of time with my son so it wasn't a good experience having a meal together.  And for the price of 2 burgers and a shake NO way ~~  they did refund me the cost of my burger. And the place wasn't that clean. I think they are lacking management?"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my most favorite Smashburger locations, because service tends to be better and the restaurant cleaner. This weekend though, all the open tables were dirty and I ended up cleaning it myself, also there were no regular sized drink lids left, so I opted to go without. 

I ordered the standard cheeseburger toppings on mine (American cheese, onions, pickles, lettuce and tomato), and went with the grilled chicken and multigrain bun. I decided to try something new, going with the fried pickles. I've usually never been disappointed with fried pickles out, but I can say I am NOT a fan. A couple were good, but I could not finish them, my date didn't care for them either. 

My date ordered the bacon avocado club on the grilled chicken and the sweet potato fries asking for a side of ranch dressing. I much prefer the sweet potato fries, and would recommend them over the fried pickles. 

A few hiccups on this visit, they forgot the ranch dressing ordered extra with the sweet potato fries. The tables were dirty as I said, and they were out of regular lids for the drinks. They also seemed to be having technical problems, because when we ordered the screens were not working, so we worked off the paper menu. 

We did have a coupon for the 4th of July which gave us $5 from signing up for their Smash Club, still the bill came to $20 and change. Seems like a lot for two combos in my opinion with a messy restaurant and so so service. I would like to see their coupons give more off if you order more expensive items, say grilled chicken burgers (a percent rather than a set amount). The coupons are definitely geared at the beef burgers. 

Would I go back? Maybe for another deal, especially if it gave me off more than $5. For regular price - no, but that's just me."}
{"text":"fast casual. that is their motive. this place fights for my second favorite burger in town (The Grind). fresh ingredients make these burgers' MO and some secret seasoning in the patty's grind. mcdonald's old french fry recipe with a bit of a twist. i've had a 1/3lb, 1/2lb, grilled chicken, and fried chicken. two salads, 4 different types of burgers, and 2 different kids meals (they sponsor my softball team so we are there frequently). $10 for a burger meal seems pricy but they have it all figured out. 

And until the end of Feb, they have LV's sin city burger. Do not miss out on this. Best selling burger in all SmashBurger stores nationwide. Also, this camelback location won franchise of the  year in 2010. be on the lookout for the SmashMobile driving around."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Arizona burger is perfect! This is the burger joint that I bring my family and friends from out of town! I love the convenience of the location as well! Very yummy food! The smash fries are the best and a must order when you go! Once in a while I will treat myself to a shake but sometimes it is hard to resist! Also it is right across from the Camden #apartments that I live at so it is a great go to for a Burger night or quick lunch!Thumbs up Smashburger! #scottsdaleaz #scottsdalelife #camdenliving #camdenlegacy"}
{"text":"I passed this location a few times while on vacation.  I was curious how this place was and I asked my sister and she said she didn't know because she didn't try this place either.  We decided to go here on the night before I left to come back to Hawaii.

It's a very small restaurant it can seat about 30 - 40 people.  The shopping center they are located in, is fairly small but we were able to find parking.  The restaurant is clean and cozy.  There were a few people dining in when we arrived.  The guy that took our order was really friendly and patient.

I ordered the truffle mushroom burger with smash fries.  I have never had fries with rosemary, olive oil and garlic before.  I did enjoy it very much.  The burger omg thank you yelo for the recommendation because it was the best burger ever!  It was very tasty!  As I type this review I'm craving for that burger and I want to eat it now!  

This is not your typical burger joint though because you need to order every thing ala carte.  Smash fries were $1.99 and the regular burger is $5.99 and I'm not sure how much the drink was I can't remember.

I would definetly be back to eat that burger again!"}

ate here today with my whole crew
the order ranged from salads to burgers to shakes to fried pickles.
everyone was extremely satisfied with their food

i had the Baja Cobb salad with extra jalapenos and chicken. tried a bite of the fried pickles (extremely good great flavor)"}
{"text":"I have visited many Smashburgers in multipme states over the last 6 or 7 years and haven't had any issues up until today.  I ordered a burger as usual and when it arrived I took a nice big bite and had to spit it out.  The burger was beyond salty, it was awful.  I spoke with the expeditor and explained my issue and asked for a different burger.  He rudely told me \"lots of people complain about the saltiness of our burgers but we use the same amount of seasoning on all of our burgers.\"  I explained I had been to many locations before and had never had a burger this salty (we ordered 3 other sandwiches and none tasted like mine).  The man I spoke to took my burger and told the cook to remake it, and as I was walking away already frustrated I couldn't change my burger he told the cook to \"use less seasoning\".  I waited and when my new sandwich came out I took a bite and it was as bland and unseasoned as can be.  I mentioned this to the female who brought out my burger and she in a much friendlier tone asked what she could do for me.  I told her I would eat my kids chicken fingers and my toddler would eat the bland piece of meat I was served.  I was very hungry at this point and the rest of our party was half way through their food.  So unhappy with this location, probably won't go back to this one."}
{"text":"My family had lunch here on Saturday.  It was phenomenal--one of the best burgers I've ever had.  They have several standard burgers, but you can also custom order your burger and have your choice of bun, cheese, and 15 sauces and toppings.
The sweet potato fries were also very good.
The milkshakes were homemade with several different flavors available beyond chocolate & vanilla.  Yummy!
If you want a premium burger, fries and/or milkshake experience, this is it. 
However it's not cheap.  Expect to spend about $11 for a burger, fries and soda."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, Burger was way overcooked and the fries were not hot or fresh. This location is just not ran very well."}
{"text":"Really, $5 for a smashed burger and little flavor?  Can't say that I will be back, except for the fried pickles, maybe.  

I guess there are certain burger joints that I don't understand, this is one of them.  I heard great things but was very disappointed.  The flavor of the burger just wasn't there.  I was not a fan of the fries, too much rosemary for me.  Again, the fried pickles were amazing and they serve beer, so that was a bonus.

Maybe it was just me, but still worth a try for those of you who have not ate here."}
{"text":"I won't be back.  The burger was OK, (I would rather have a In-n-out burger across the street) my son got the fried pickles and they were terrible.  I got the Fried veggies and the portion size was comical for the $3 they charged me.  
Overall, it is overpriced and not very good.  
Go across the street to In-N-Out, you will have a better meal and pay half the $."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised and will re-visit again soon. The burgers are great and the folks that work at the Centennial Center restaurant were very nice.  Nice tunes to listen to while you are there also.  The only thing that i would recommend is changing from a fry grill to a broiler."}
{"text":"Me and my bf come here a lot due to convenience and price.

There have been several times that I have watched my food sitting under the heat lamps when I ordered it to go (sitting there for 2-4min).

There's been multiple times that we haven't got our full order,the staff seem to forget simple orders like a second cheese burger and will try to get you to pay for it again.

Also when it's slow the assistant manager loves to play games on the customers and act like he doesn't understand people orders well walking away when you're trying to order.

So far there food is ok but due to it siting under the heat lamps its a little dried out"}
{"text":"I don't review much, but the customer service was good enough that I felt the need to mention it. The shift leader on duty tonight was on point and attentive to guests, the food was ready quickly, it was good, and the entire staff met the Gorbes 5 star level of service"}
{"text":"Smashburger: their never frozen beef patties are smashed with a press for 10 seconds to allow the grill portion to caramelize, thus sealing in the juices and allowing them to percolate within. This is their claim to fame.  Supposedly this method provides a superior tasty patty as compared to all other \"fast food\" hamburger chains.  Food is ordered at a main counter, you are give a number,  and then the food is delivered to your table usually in less than five minutes.  

Upon entering the facility, we were quickly greeted and rushed into ordering.  Upon ordering I realized why the rush.  There are a bevy of options including bread, toppings, multiple sides and even desserts.  Ordering takes some time and the line can grow quickly.  I ordered the Create Your Own Hamburger with the egg bun, lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard, jalapeño, and pepper jack cheese. The sides were french fries and haystack onions.  For desert we split a hand-spun peppermint shake.  

The burger patty itself is the first thing you notice when you bite into the surprisingly delicate bun and toppings.  It is not a drippy, thick, two handed burger.  Definitely fresh tasting, caramelized, juicy flavor, but not the best burger I have ever had.  I was still hungry after the burger, a bit unusual.  The fresh fries were neither good nor bad.  The haystack onions were kind of greasy, clumped up in bunches and also just ok.  The seasonal peppermint shake was served in a solid, heavy glass shake cup and tasty as a shake should be.  

I would come back here to try other items on the menu so I can see why this os one of the fastest food chains in America. After this meal, however, I can only speculate..."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED: Smashburger rocks!  The food is made fresh and to order. The staff is super friendly. It's no surprise that this chain is expanding fast.

My personal favorite is the Truffle Mushroom Swiss Big Smash!  The organic arugula adds the perfect flavor. If I've been extra good, I'm happy to reward myself with either their smash fries or a butterfinger hand spun milkshake."}
{"text":"Good solid and friendly service. The BiG Smashburger was delicious. Good comes out fresh and fast. The burger was juicy and one of the best around. The chocolate shake was sooooo good, I gave myself a brain freeze and it was worth every ounce of pain. Well played Smashburger...well played."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and the staff here are very friendly and know how to deliver fast service!"}
{"text":"I give up! While my kids and I really like the food, the last two times we ordered to go the orders were wrong. The first time they forgot the jalapeños on the side and there was no sauce for the haystack onions. Not that bad if a mistake. The second time I got home to find my cheeseburger had no cheese. I called and they offered me a free burger next time. Much to their credit, when I said I wouldn't be back they comped the meal. I'm bummed because this is a place my kids and I like and the other location is a bit of a drive. I don't understand why getting an order correct is so difficult for places."}
{"text":"They had the classic smash and the create your own.   Forgot to take pics but they looked good. I am dieting."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy!!! Best burgers for this price!!! Service great!!"}
{"text":"Hey come on now, Smashburger isn't THAT bad.

At least, this one was better than the one I had in Irvine. Ugh. It's true though, first impressions are important. And for the one in Irvine in Socal, that one made me just be like wtf is this. 

But in the Forum Food Court in Caesar's Palace, I decided that I try Smashburger. Looking back, I should have tried Earl of Sammiches or something else not accessible/not eaten by me, but it was late, I needed dinner at 9.30pm, and this was the first thing I saw in the food court.

First off, really nice service. I was greeted by the cashier and asked how my day was. Heck, most of the places today, you aren't asked that, and as a visitor to a city, you get to enjoy that more to explain that you're from out of town and that you're all giddy with your Fat Tuesday cup that you got from just down the Forum Shops and that you're now hungers. 

I got the original, which didn't look cold, which actually looked palatable, didn't have a lot of oil, didn't look like a menace. It looked edible. A plus. It tasted decently enough like a burger would be, but you know it's fast food, not the gourmet burgers that you get.

It came out FAST. It took within a MINUTE from ordering to getting it to actually get the burger. I don't know what to say about that tho xD

Prices seemed higher for some odd reason, ($7-8), which seems kinda high for a burger.. Hmmm."}
{"text":"Malts have a strong malt flavor with the chocolate, I would get that alone, except the burgers are cooked, not scorched.  This store buffaloed my burger, like the chicken, and that came out great."}
{"text":"At long last I was able to try Smash Burger. I had high hopes for an expertly crafted burger. But to my surprise  I will just have to wait a little longer. The burger was so salty that I wondered if perhaps one of the chefs was listening to and going along with Mercy Me's title track \"Shake\". It is a very catchy tune! And the issue I had with the fries is that they are made for skinny people since they somewhat resemble shoe string potatoes. But I guess I am dating myself with the shoe string potatoes. A long ago staple. Now for the positive -4 stars for friendliness and service."}
{"text":"Sin City Smashburger is to die for!  A must stop for me when I'm in Las Vegas.  Everyone loves In-N-Out, but I have to admit that I like Smashburger more."}
{"text":"I just scrolled through the reviews and I am shocked. Someone really likes this place? It was a huge disappointment. The food was below adverage. In and out is much better. The price is fine the fries never showed up so I can't say. 
Two stars at the absolute most. I may , if desperate, try a chicken sandwich. It was a greasy disgusting hamburger, I did not take the leftovers for my dog.  The ambiance is car wash. The help are looking suicidal."}
{"text":"I looooove that they have a gluten free option! Udi's gluten free buns can be substituted with any burger. That being said, my chicken BBQ sandwich was awesome! I also ordered a salad that I was a little less excited about. The taste was great but the size was incredibly disappointing; there was almost no lettuce! I also thought our total was a bit out of line for what was ordered: full size salad, gluten free & a regular chicken bacon burger, a regular drink and a small shake amounted to just shy of $40.00!"}
{"text":"Just left here and had just an odd, twilight zone experience. The cashier takes our order, we order  a grilled chicken Buffalo and blue cheese sandwich and a grilled bacon/avocado sandwich. We go to pay and notice the cashier puts in a grilled spinach/goat sandwich. My husband says, I want the grilled avocado sandwich not the spinach/goat, cashier tells him they already started making it, so just take it and it's really good....waaaa??? So bizarre, he didn't push it, but was like what just happened here? We sit down, order comes out, I get a grilled chicken sandwich with mayo tomatoes and lettuce....not a buffalo chicken...take it back, cook just throws some wing sauce on it and gives it back. I sit down and my husband looks at his spinach/goat cheese and is like, they even forgot the goat cheese on the sandwich I didn't order....so bizarre. Staff need customer service training and cooks need to pay attention to the orders they're making."}
{"text":"The mushroom truffle burger is definitely nom-a-licious, & I'm pretty fond of their fried pickles as well! The egg buns are also a nice touch & pretty as well. We've only gotten orders to go, but I can't recall the service ever being bad. The only downfall is that their burgers can be a bit messy, so make sure you get extra napkins!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy excessive vomiting, uncontrollable diarrhea, and being bedridden for days, then SmashBurger is the place to go!

Only $6.99 + tax and you'll be served up a hidden dose of food poisoning in your favorite flavor - mine was chicken avocado... Mmm! Oh, and that price doesn't even include fries or a drink to wash down the feeling of regret!

Im not sure if it was the tiny tomato slices, the browning avocado, or the overly flattened chicken that made me drop ill. It also could have been the three miniaturized slices of swine or potentially moldy bread. To be honest I didn't think I was required to pre-inspect my food!

Meanwhile, next door at Chipotle, patrons queue up for a delectable Mexican meal in herds. All seemingly with the understanding that it's worth standing in line for an extra 20 minutes to order from a Mexican fast food than to sacrifice their stomach and next 48 hours for SmashBurger."}
{"text":"Double check your orders
I ordered  a regular classic smash burger. I asked for the tomatoes to be put on the side. I did not receive my tomatoes. I opened up the kitchen door and said hey guys can I get those tomatoes? After five minutes I flagged down a server, he physically got me the tomatoes that took 3 seconds. Good news is I got another piece of lettuce to put on my hamburger.
They have tatertots and they have smashTots...
 I see no difference for the extra price!!! Can you say overhead? These children don't get paid enough to be concise throughout the day.
          CHECK YOUR ORDERS!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is destined to be like the rest of the failures in this location. Literally had like 8-9 employees working in an empty restaurant when we arrived. Ordered two simple burgers, one of which was correct and the second which was to have grilled onions and mustard ONLY!! Came with extra ketchup lol. Sent back for a new one while 7-8 employee's stood around talking or texting. What makes it worse is their supervisor stood around chit chatting with these employees. What a shame and the burgers were just okay."}
{"text":"What a welcome change from the burgers of McDonalds and Burger King. I had forgotten how a great sandwich tastes like until I tried this place. The Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken Strips are amazing. Soft, Crisp and well made. Given that this place is situated inside Caesars Palace hotel, the prices appear high (although inside this is inside a food court). A fountain drink costs around 5$! They offer domestic and imported beer. The good point is that they are open pretty late. After I was back into the hotel at about 1 am, this place was still open. The cashiers are nice and friendly - they often try to have a small chat with you. Overall, a good place if you are looking for something quick."}
{"text":"Comparing this against five guys, in and out and all other fast food joints, this is by far my favorite. The meat tastes like 100% Angus and the bun and toppings are great. I ordered the Big BBQ Bacon and Cheddar Regular Smash fries and a drink. It's cheaper than five guys and tastes better. For $12 it is well worth it. The smash fries are tossed in olive oil and rosemary (I think). Great combo for fries. The portion of fries and the size of the burger is great for $12 bucks. They were really busy but the food got out very fast. The staff kept the place clean as well. 5 star experience. Good job."}
{"text":"Worst experience. Ordered online and then i was told they can't fry an egg so i call the store to ask them about it and the girl just laughs at me. That's not the best customer service. Finally after we get our foos it's all messy, missing ingredients and the bun is soggy. GROSS. I'm so disappointed and probably won't be back. Luckily 5 guys just opened down the road and i know they will have better customer service."}
{"text":"First time visitor to a Smashburger.  The location was very busy, and very loud.  I got my food to go.  I had a bacon burger and some of the seasoned smash fries.  The burger was excellent.  Nice flavors and it was actually tasty.  The smash flavors were interesting.  I definately would go back and order the same things."}
{"text":"We come here every year on our annual Vegas trip after shopping at the outlets. I noticed they have a Drive thru during this trip which is nice if you don't feel like getting out of the car.  I got the sweet potato fries and Spicy Jalepeno burger. I like the fact the burgers are fresh, fresh jalapeños and guacamole on the burger.  Lots of seating as well."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint. The selection of burgers is fun and its nice to see whole wheat AND egg buns. I ordered a burger that came with apple wood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado. The beef was seasoned perfectly but a bit thin, I guess \"regular\" sized is one patty. The whole wheat bun was soft and sweet, you know sometimes whole wheat can be very cardboard like. I paired my burger with the sweet potato fries. Which were doused in sea salt, a bit off putting but once I shook some of the salt off they were decent. Possibly a bit over salted. 

It's a solid place to grab a fast burger that doesn't make you feel as guilty as other places. The side selections are nice but nothing \"wowed\" me."}
{"text":"Very good burger joint - small size is all u need - can get messy!  However, u can maintain control by flipping your sandwich over with every bite. Sin city burger is the best with fried egg!  Yum!  We'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for a while... a long while. For me burgers are my go to comfort food. Smashburger makes a great burger to be a chain. The service was good, the place was packed on a Saturday afternoon. 

The onion straws weren't too greasy and the smashburger sauce had a nice combination of flavors. 

What else is there to say, they make a good burger."}
{"text":"I ordered the Classic burger with American cheese and lettuce, onions and tomatoes. The patty was pretty big----a lot larger than the bun. Very juicy. The bun was strong and didn't break apart. I didn't like the Smashfries very much. It was too oily. The thin fries tasted like the Ore-Ida fries you can buy at the local grocery store. In my opinion, the fries should complete the burger the experience and cheap-o Ore-Ida fries just ruined the experience. I would give them 5 stars if the fries were fresh-cut like In-N-Out Burger or Five Guys. The Haystack onion rings were also very oily. I don't think olive oil tastes good with fries or onion rings.  If SmashBurger made these improvements, I think it would increase sales. The service was great and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not a fast food junkie, but I was starving and had heard good things about Smashburger, so I decided to stop by and order the \"big\" size avocado bacon burger and a large fry.  

The burger was really good.  The meat, avocado and bacon were all fresh and very tasty.  The fries were lukewarm and average at best.

If money was no object, i'd definitely come back for the burger; but money is an object, and i'm a die-hard value shopper, so at a price of over $11 after tax, I just couldn't help but think of all the better ways I could have spent my money.  Maybe i'm just not in touch with the average price of eating fast food these days."}
{"text":"Got to Smashburger on Sahara and Fort Apache at 9:48 - door is locked but there are people inside and the sign on the door says open until 10 pm everyday!  I actually tried to call on my way over to place the order at 9:40 or so and no one answered at the branch.  Nice that the employees wanted to go home early but this doesn't do much for their reputation!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Smashburger on 9460 S. Eastern in Las Vegas; we thought trying them at 5:24pm would be great. Unfortunately it was pretty empty that was a clue to leave. But like Fatburger its should be cooked while you wait. So I didn't let that discourage us. Beside, I was excited, the worker ignored us for 5 minutes. I didn't get names, my receipt says Nathan, who was talking to a black guy who finally went back to the kitchen to cook. Finally a nice girl ask how can I help. It wasn't a warm place to eat glad we chose takeout. DON'T DO TAKEOUT!! the burger was extremely salty, my husband burger was worse, he toss it.  The bag was very greasy, the burger wrapping  paper was also; the cook took no pride in making it neat at all. The fries were old and dried out. But as we waited for our order I saw fries go by which were freshly cooked; not ours I guess they give the old fries to takeout.  I gave all my coupons away. As customers came in. I wish I had a 5 star experience, maybe the staff is writing the reviews. This burger joint won't last hopefully."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Shakes and burgers are great. The AZ burger is by far my favorite!! Just dont question how many calories are in it...you dont want to know haha"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and check each bag to make sure your entire order is given to you. Even with the manager helping package my to go order, I was missing an item. Am I going to drive back for it, NO, I'm already home. Disappointed that two people couldn't package my to go order correctly and that I didn't discover it until home."}
{"text":"Smashburger, and order-and-seat-yourself eatery, has a great concept. Take Five Guys, add chicken and veggie patties as options, and update the toppings and sauces to include the coveted avocado and a spicy chipotle mayo (which was delicious once I convinced myself to forget how gross mayonaisse is).

A variety of sides includes something for everyone, like fried pickles, salads, and the \"smashfries\" in regular and sweet potato varietals. Topped with rosemary and salt, these greasy bad boys won the prize for the night.  The black-bean patty was quite tasty and the multigrain bun wasn't too dry. 

I'd probably return for another visit, but not unless I were already in the area."}
{"text":"Called in an order for lunch at work to pick up, they were quick and efficient! LOVE the grilled chicken sandwich here. Nice to have something tasty/somewhat healthy that's not extremely overpriced. Never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"Ate here a while ago but got the food to go and it wasn't all that great. It was raining and I didn't feel like looking for too many places so figured I'd try it again. It was pretty good this time around, definitely will go back there again. I got the bbq bacon burger and fries and a kids cheeseburger. The kids meal is a bit pricey even compared to restaurants but they do give you a ton of food, and we had plenty to take home And make two meals out of it. The service was great while in there, people always walking around asking if you need anything."}
{"text":"Ok didn't get me wrong the food is great I love the burgers here. Special
Hint get the kids meals very filling and half the price ur patty size is a little smaller but not by much. 

So to the reason why it's getting three stars. 
FIRST ITS FUCKING FREEZING IN HERE AND EVERY TIME I WALK IN HERE!!! Burr

Second reason the smash fries so good but they taste different everything I come in. Weird

Other than that this place is yum!!"}
{"text":"My bad. I ordered the spinach, goat cheese and cucumber burger. I've been to smash before an thought I would try something new. Bad choice. Dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre and just not as good as In N Out, and prices are much higher also.

Came here one night for a quick bite to eat. Ordered the burger with a fried egg with a side of sweet potato fries. The burger was mediocre, bun was a bit hard, the fried egg definitely made it taste better. The sweet potato fries were just uneatable. They were dry, hard, with some bitterness to them. They were obviously undercooked, and many fries were still raw. The quality of the ingredients were questionable.

The restaurant was clean, bathrooms are clean, parking is easy. But the food doesn't taste good, so I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I got a tea spoon of avocado to start off with!! The burger was the size of a lil kids menu burger!! The shake was nasty did not taste like a real shake was not creamy at all!! It was my first time here and WILL not come back here to this place!!!! I wish I could not put not one  here"}
{"text":"Not worth an $8 burger and $5.50 more for fries. Salad isn't bad but too many seeds. I think this place is way overrated."}
{"text":"Try the veggie frites! They're amazing!

And the burgers are consistently great!  My lovely bride and I hit this place at least once a month for our burger and malt fix.  We've tried all the other places (Five Guys, Fatburger, In-n-Out), and we keep coming back to SmashBurger.  The fact that you can get a locally brewed Hefewiezen or a can of old school Oly or PBR with your burger only makes it more awesome.  Great service, great food, and convenient.  I can't recommend this place highly enough!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a better burger, I was encouraged by the buzz on this place. This will be a real quick review, not some long winded piece of too much information.
Service wasn't very good. 2 out of 3 burgers came out wrong. Sent one of them back twice because they didn't believe (or couldn't believe) that is wasn't prepared as ordered.
Bad way to start off a first time visit. The fries, in my opinion, were too limp and not crispy enough for my tastes.
The burgers were actually good, tasty meat and good quality buns but my 2 start rating is because the whole experience wasn't very good."}
{"text":"This visit was better than my first. Food wise that is. The classic bacon cheeseburger was phenom. The meat was the bomb, they hit the mark on this one. One thing about bacon on a burger, I hate it when you take a bite and drag the entire bacon slice out of the burger because it's too chewey or stale or whatever. Not this one. Perfectly cooked bacon. I'm sold"}
{"text":"Smashburger creates excellent hamburger specialties that taste amazing. I love their onion strings and their smash fries! Dipping the smash fries in ranch sauce tastes amazing. The BBQ burger is by far the best.

I've always had great service at this location, but it is super popular during lunch time since their are a ton of office locations on and around Sunset. Be aware that you'll have to spend some time in line and possibly wait a while for a table if you're coming during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"First time I went I had a burger that was as salty as sea water. Also tasted a bit crappy. Decided to give this place a second time after a day or so and the food still was very salty and tasted like sea weed. Not worth the $$ paid. The servers were very friendly though. Three stars based on the service I got. Half a star based on food."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a must once a week for my son after school . He gets kids smash . As for me I get Baja salad delicious . Employees very friendly. Steven is the best. Brings food to the table very quickly."}
{"text":"Mediocre food for a premium price...  ordered the avocado chicken club.  The meat was thin and small portion.  Seasoned well though, just not much there.  The temperature was lukewarm at best.  The other ingredients were fresh though.  The fries were lukewarm as well, boring and limp.   Disappointing since I had to wait a while for it, like it sat for a bit.  For $13 I expected more.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Bad experience!! I've been to smashburger  before and liked it, so I wanted to take my boyfriend. We went there on a Tuesday night and the burgers were ok. I was VERY disappointed in the manger ( man in red shirt) he was just cutting up with staff and worst of all was playing with the red drinking cups! Ehhh had his hands all over them! Soo if you are going to eat here make sure to get a paper cup!!!"}
{"text":"This is a burger that could spawn a dramatic increase in American Obesity. 

I got the Sin City Burger with Cheddar. It was better than all the pretenders: In N Out, Five Guys, Red Robin, even the Mighty Midwest Culvers. It was perfectly balanced, full of excellent everything, and glorious in every way. Every way. Even unwrapping it the stuff that fell out (glorious melty cheese, fresh grilled onions...) was spectacular.

The smash fries were pretty solid. Probably would have been improved by condiments. Price was excellent. Burger came out in five minutes, everyone was nice and I could have had a beer. Perfection in a burger joint. Perfection.

This is the best burger I have ever had, anywhere, at any price. I don't want to eat other food anymore. I just want to live here."}
{"text":"Very Disappointing Service. Went in on Friday Aug.11th. I ordered 2 double triples w/out cheese. The greasy girl at the cashier Named: Victoria had the audacity to turn to her fellow employees  (who was verifying my order, had No cheese) And said yeah weird huh?!?!? It's a burger place and your employees have the nerve to insult people over the main 2 options a burger has. Shameful customer service"}
{"text":"Burgers were salty. One of the burgers was raw in the center. Milkshakes were divine though. Quite pricey for a burger joint. Staff seem distracted and took away our platters too soon."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I had heard great things about Smashburger and I love burgers and chicken sandwiches. That being said, I will never eat at one again thanks to my poor experience at the Eastern location. I walk in and decide on getting the club burger, which I then decide to change to the club chicken to try to be healthy. I ordered onion strings and a nutter butter shake, so much for healthy. The young lady helping me put in the order and about ten seconds later I decided that the burger sounded better. She changes the order and quickly tells the cook in the kitchen to make it a burger instead. He immediately begins yelling from the kitchen about how much food they've wasted today by changing orders and that he had already put the chicken on the grill. I could see that the young lady was embarrassed from the scene he was causing, so I said I'll just take the chicken.

A few minutes later the shake comes out, which was good. Followed by my chicken sandwich and onion strips. I take two bites of the chicken and it tastes like rubber. The onion strips were pure grease, so I stopped after two bites from them. All this as two young ladies are sweeping the floors around me and spraying cleaning products on the tables around me. Always a pleasant experience when you're trying to eat. I stop eating and one of the young men that works there walks by and askes how the food is. I tell him that the shake was good, but the chicken tasted like rubber and the onion strips were all grease. He responds by saying that they are known for their burgers and he has heard several people say the chicken is rubbery. He then follows up by saying that he made the shake and was glad I liked it. He then walked away.

After a few minutes I asked to speak with the manager. He comes out and I explain everything to him. His response...yeah, I've had to spaak to that cook several times about doing that, but he's a bit upset because they keep changing the orders on him. He then says that he's sorry I didn't like the food and they are trying to get the kitchen running how they want it. He then walks away. Doesn't offer to refund my money or make me something else, just walks away. I spent almost $15 on food and ate about $6 worth. I wouldn't have even expected all of my money back, just the money for the chicken and onion strings. Total disappointment in the quality of service and food. Luckily In-N-Out was down the street. Two double doubles for half the price hit the spot.

My recommendation: DO NOT go to this Smashburger until they make some major changes in the service and kitchen standards."}
{"text":"Wonderful food at good prices. The SmashFries are AMAZING. Can't wait until there is one of these closer to me in north central Phoenix."}
{"text":"1st time at this location. Very friendly people and nice too.  Great service and their manager is funny :D"}
{"text":"My chicken sandwich didn't taste very good and the amount of chicken was really skimpy compared to the $7.00 I spent for it. My son liked his burger. The cashier girl who handled our money was also handling and filling the to-go cups for the sauces and if you know anything about touching money and germs, bacteria, and sanitation, the fact that she did NOT wear gloves completely grossed us out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, and really great customer service. I just went in everybody was extremely friendly. I haven't come in here in a few weeks but the man at the cash register knew my name and was like bryan with a y right? I was pretty impressed great staff but ever greater food. Please keep up the good work"}
{"text":"My initial impression was positive, seeing that they have a fast-casual approach, not the pretentious approach of some \"gourmet burger\" places. Initial look at the menu & menu board took a step back, as the burgers were all listed as \"regular\" or \"big\". Standard weight measurements are an industry standard and give a better idea of what to expect, \" big\" does not.

I got a big burger, which overhang the bun (due to being smashed, I guess). It was good, all toppings slid out of the sandwich on the second bite, making a mess. The fries were thin shoe strings. Very good and just crisped up nicely. Delish. I would come back just for the fries.

I'm not a shake drinker, but the milkshakes are branded by Hagan Daas, so that's a good thing I suppose."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for lunch on a Sunday. I got the black bean burger and my husband and kids got  regular burgers. The avacado ranch black bean burger was tasty (I got it without ranch) We all got gluten free buns. It is nice to have a gluten free option instead of having to get a bunless burger and some good vegetarian options. My husband and I split a harvest salad, which was fresh and delicious. We also got the smash fries, which were yummy. The kids enjoyed their meals and I was happy that they had organic milk available. 

The food came out very quickly. The only complaint I have is that the girl running the cash register seemed a bit clueless and not thrilled to be there. Everything else was great and I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING.  There were 10 of us celebrating Mother's Day.  We had kid meals, burgers, chicken, shakes, fries, sweet potato fries, veggie frites, thin fried onion rings. I had a black bean burger with crimini mushrooms,  swiss cheese and avocado on a Multigrain bun. It was delicious. The staff was so attentive and the food was prepared so fast. A special thank you to Mikalai who guided us through the menu. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice, crowded and clean fast food place with good menu and plenty of options. I tried spinach goat cheese chicken burger and liked it a lot. It's not heavy and comes on a whole wheat bun. 
I forgot to try sweet potato fries but there's always a next time! :)"}
{"text":"Really good sauces and everything! Especially the fries ! They are killer ! First time ther but definitely would go again !"}
{"text":"If I had to base my review on food taste only, it would be closer to 4 stars or a little higher. It's the service that brings this down to barely a 2. I wanted to like this location so badly since it is relatively close to our home, but I just can't. I have ordered here a grand total of 5 times since they opened, and they are 0-5 in getting my order actually right. The first time I was there I ordered to-go and waited 30 minutes for my food. By the time I got it I was so fed up I just walked out with the food without checking it (shame on me). When I got home, the entire order was made incorrectly. So I called in to let them know and they said to come back in and they would remake it. I gave them the order over the phone and they said it would be ready when I got there. After I arrived it was another 20 minutes to get my food. This time, I checked to make sure I had the right items before leaving, but didn't check the inside of the burgers. When i got home, they had left half of the toppings off the burger. My wife and I ate them anyway because I didn't want to drive back a third time. 
I have been back a few more times and every time I am there, they get the order completely wrong and it takes forever to get food. I am not kidding when I say that while I am standing there waiting for my food every trip, I see at least 4 or 5 customers bringing food back up to the counter because it was made wrong. I feel bad for the front staff, because they are friendly and seem to be efficient. They just have to deal with a completely incompetent cooking staff that needs to be retrained or let go. If they can ever get their act together, I will gladly recommend them. But until then...save your money and your time."}
{"text":"Hands down my fav burger chain in Calgary and in the south side of town. 

Service is very prompt and friendly here. Portions are good size and burgers cooked to perfection each time I have been here. Egg bun to die for! Limited children's menu but good enough for kids 2 and up. 

Very clean location with plenty of parking in front and behind the restaurant. 

Love the take out bags feel like you went shopping at a clothing store! 

Must eat!!!"}
{"text":"One of my fav burger joints in Calgary even though its from Denver. 

Burgers taste fresh and hot each time. 

Get the Sin City special burger. Very very tasty. Won't spoil it but trust me if you enjoy  you won't be disappointed. 

Location has plenty of booths and sitting area. Self serve pop machine. 

Best burgers in Calgary."}
{"text":"Went in tonight on a lunch break after I had already pre ordered my food. You would think it would be quicker, by you would be wrong. I waited 22 minutes to get my food that was cold and soggy. Does that make sense to anyone?!?"}
{"text":"Nicest staff ever! We drive past two other Smashburger locations to go here because of the friendly peeps who work here and will go to great lengths to keep you happy!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat when on ASU campus. I usually just order a kids meal because for the price you pay you get normal size hot dog, side of fries and small soda... which is more than enough to fill me up! 

The staff at this specific location are really nice too!"}
{"text":"The Arizona turkey burger is amazing! This spot is always clean, friendly, and fresh! I had the kindest employee, Morgan Dishman, help me decide what I should get. Excellent staff, great food."}
{"text":"Burger was far too dry. It was tasteless; their patty is totally unseasoned, tastes like leather. Salads are far too small for the prize they charge. Couldn't feed a bird with it lol. Thanks but no thanks. Next time I rather starve."}
{"text":"Smashburger is located in the Ceasars food court.  It was one of the only places open in the morning, so we were able to grab breakfast here.  It was either smashburger or Starbucks..lol.

 We ordered the breakfast burger ($8), which came with a beef patty, eggs, and  bacon.  After paying at the counter, we only had to wait about 5 minutes for our food  to be ready.

 The breakfast burger was better than expected.  There was generous amounts of bacon strips in the burger, and they were nice and crispy.  The egg on top was also cooked very well.  

Customers can still order fries even though its not listed on the menu in the morning.

Overall, Smashburger is a good place to grab a quick bite to eat if you are in Ceasars."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Priscilla was very nice. Food was great!!!! Will come again!!!!"}
{"text":"Why on earth have I never eaten here before!

Burger was cooked and seasoned perfectly, it covered the whole bun so none of that crazy end of the burger but soggy bun thing going on. Gotta say this is one of the best burgers I have ever had, a close second to the one at Wolfgang Pucks at MGM. I might lose my Pacific Northwest card for saying this but it was even better than Dick's. 

The Smashfries were amazing too. I was a little iffy when I saw how skinny they were.  But they weren't super crunchy and the flavor was awesome.  Would love to try them with some fresh garlic on top :)

The prices are very reasonable for a quick bite. 

Service is amazing, everyone we dealt with was happy to be here, happy to help and checked to see how we were doing! 

They carry local beers, would love to see something from Bad Beat Brewing, and have a decent iced tea selection. 

We will be back again, and again!

{"text":"I've been to several of their locations and can't fault the taste of their burgers. This is my number 1 favorite burger place in Vegas (unless I want more gourmet/uniqueness, in which case I recommend bachi). I eat here on a regular basis and the portions are generous so if you think they are overpriced there is a reason for it. Just love it. Can't fault them. And now I want a burger :/"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to a Smashburger. I'm kind of over the whole fancy burger trend, but sometime when you crave a burger, ya just gotta go for it!

It was that kind of night. Crave a burger night. I went to Smashburger just expecting to get something basic. Instead I opted for the Spicy Jalapeño Baja. It was your basic burger, but added in were freshly sliced Jalapeños, chipotle mayo and pepper jack cheese on a rustic bun. It was great and so fresh! The fries weren't nasty and greasy, and went perfectly with a side of ranch dressing.

Overall, I'm back on the burger bandwagon, and I don't have to settle for some greasy fast food mess if I want something quick to eat. The staff was also very friendly, which was surprising considering I walked in about 30min before closing. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good burger. Good service.  When i need a burger fix thats close to home i will definately come here instead of carls or mickie d's."}
{"text":"Waaay too expensive had a coupon and still paid 12 bucks for a drink burger make own  chicken and VERY SMALL  order of fries....booth we sat in was dirty and wall falling apart looks like store is ALSO...was noon and store was dead need to lower prices and improve food....whataburger or inn out much better..habit next door also"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I have no idea why they seemed to be fairly busy when we were there on a Sunday afternoon.. the only feasible option being every person in there was either hungover or still drunk from the night before and needed something bland and greasy to coat their stomachs.

First of all, they don't offer a veggie burger. ..Seriously? Yet their menu online states they do. SO basically if you're vegetarian you can get something somewhat resembling a grilled cheese; or they'll offer to put a runny fried egg on top- appetite whetted? Note to the veg*ns: Not worth your time.

The boyfriend got the biggest burger possible and was thoroughly disappointed in everything on it. Somehow it was piled high with seemingly interesting ingredients yet he swore up and down it was less than lackluster, no taste at all. He also got their haagan dazs chocolate shake and it had only the slightest hint of a chocolate taste and was runny. Runny. Haagan Dazs, Shake. Doesn't make sense, right?

The bread is super gross and gets soggy. The only semi-redeeming item(s) are the fried pickles and flash-fried asparagus. But honestly, how can you muck that up?

Waste of money! Bring your business somewhere local."}
{"text":"Don't bother. The french fry portion was very small, but they very good and the iced tea was fresh brewed. The hamburger bun was dry and the burger was over cooked. The price is on par with Five Guys, but Five Guys is much better. This place is too expensive for what you get. I would not go here again."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. Its kinda like a five star Five Guys. I'd rather go to In And Out."}
{"text":"We hit this place up regularly for lunch and no complaints thus far.  They have regular coupons if you sign up for their mailing list - so that definitely cuts down on the \"gourmet\" burger pricing (especially if you use the BOGO one).  

The staff is always friendly and moves through the sometimes hectic lunch lines pretty quickly considering there are only 2 registers to use.  

Pros:
- good burgers (it's a burger joint first and foremost, so don't go in expecting restaurant service or fancy pants ambiance)
- chocolate shake is yum
- good service

Cons:
- a touch pricey, especially for a work lunch break (Use those coupons and go on a Friday as a treat for yourself!)
- this location doesn't have the online ordering option which would be nice for a quick in-and-out if you are in a hurry

Overall: A-   Go in with expectations of a burger joint that isn't trying to be McDonald's, but also isn't trying to be Ruth's Chris and you'll be good to go!"}
{"text":"This location sucks!! Burnt burger patty, no sauce or toppings. Dry dry dry. Fries were so soggy with grease they were almost inedible. Another in my party ordered a milkshake and the cup was barely half full. So glad there are other locations nearby because I won't be going here again!"}
{"text":"No complaints from me. :-) 

I walked to the counter (it's cafeteria sytle...fine by me) was greeted cheerfully (but not obnoxiously so...love that), ordered the avacado and bleucheese chicken club and a hand spun butterfinger strawberry milkshake (yummy!) and seated myself.

The sandwich was good, especially with the added bleu cheese. I enjoyed my meal while playing Hay Day on my phone (love that game!) I'll definitely be back ."}
{"text":"My College Instructor took me and my classmates out to eat after clinicals, so I suggested we eat here since we're a big group.  I rarely eat at Smashburger, but I'm glad we chose to eat here. The service was fast and friendly. Staff was always consistent on checking up on us to see if we needed anything at the table.

I had the \"Triple Double Burger\" (3 cheese and 2 beef patties) equipped with the typical lettuce, tomato, pickle and ketchup on an egg made bun. That special was only $4 which is why I got it because I felt pretty conservative since my instructor bought it for me. I regret not going all out for one of their signature burgers with smash fries and a shake. 

What I like about the menu is that I have the option to choose from a beef patty, turkey patty, crispy chicken patty or even a vegetarian bean patty. I can also build my own burger with additional toppings. 

I gave this place 4/5 stars because the burger was super greasy and kept running down my arm. I had to cover it up with napkins to drain out the oils as I bite into my burger. Not only that, I had a salad with too much spinach and not enough toppings in the order."}
{"text":"Seems like I just keep missing Jessica F. at a few places. Fortunately Im not looking for discount, free or gluten free so Ive got a better chance of giving a unbiased review. 

I don't know how to really describe it but it was just a better all round burger then Ive had in Phoenix. Had the blue cheese bacon burger with the onion (shredded onions) and IBC root beer."}
{"text":"I ordered the black bean burger and they gave me a bacon burger.  I got it to go and didn't realize it until I got home and couldn't go back.  I am a vegetarian so the burger was garbage.  That is all I have to say.  If you can't get a simple order correct then you shouldn't be in business."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp had a 1/2 Star system...this is another case where I would have given the joint 3.5 Stars.

I've read a lot of reviews about Smash Burger and wanted to give it a try for myself.  Today was the day.  I ordered the Classic Smash Burger 1/3 lb and a Chicago Dog.

The woman working at the counter was very friendly.  I ordered it to eat in because I wanted to make sure I tasted it fresh out of the kitchen.  Within 5-6 minutes my order was ready.

I decided to attack the Smash Burger first....I should have chosen the Dog...why?  Because the Beef was piping hot and it burned the hell out of my mouth!  Delicious though, but not awesome.  I could barely taste the special Smash Sauce, so the burger tasted kind of bland.....it was fresh though and the Egg Bun was awesome.

Next I attacked the Chicago Dog.....the toppings and bun were excellent, but the Hot Dog itself wasn't great....just good.  This is where that 1/2 Star comes in again.

Again, overall I'd rate this place 3.5 Stars.

Will I return?  Yes, but it didn't surpass my beloved In-N-Out as so many reviews have said."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch the other day and decided to order a 1/3 lb Spicy Baja Burger ( Pepper Jack, Guacamole, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Chipotle Mayo, and Fresh Jalapenos on a Chipotle Bun, $5.99), Chicago Dog ($3.99), Fried Pickles ($1.99).  Yes, I was starvin' like Marvin!

This was the first time for me at this Smashburger location.  It was around lunch-time and it was busy.  They give you a number after you order, then bring your food out to you.  I just left the gym and wasn't in a hurry, which was a good thing because it took almost 20 minutes to get my order.  The good thing about that is that the food is prepared fresh, the bad thing is that it's not convenient if you're in a hurry.

The first item I tried was the Baja Burger....yum, it was tasty!  I could taste the spicy heat from the fresh Jalapenos.  All of the ingredients gave this Burger a unique flavor to it.  I like.

Next I tried a few of the Fried Pickles....yuck, they failed on this one.  The Pickles were soft and chewy.....when they're served fried like this, the breading should have a slightly crispy texture to it with the Pickle on the inside providing the soft/chewy part.  Plus they were very greasy.....all of these factors usually means the temperature on the fryer is too low.  Needless to say, I didn't finish my order.

Next up was the Chicago Dog.....I like how they split the Hot Dog in half so that it holds the toppings better.  I really enjoyed the Chicago Dog....they did it right and put together a proper Chicago Dog.

Overall, it was a pretty good meal despite the fail on the Fried Pickles.  I didn't need the calories anyway.

Will I return?  Probably, but not during the lunch rush hour."}
{"text":"Tasty burger! The only reason for the four stars instead of five is because the bun is soft -- I prefer a toasted bun. This was a little too squishy for me. (Soggy feeling) and the beer was cool but not icy cold. Everything else was DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this burger joint so I guess I expected more than what I got. The burger was real salty. Like to the point where I couldn't really taste anything else. Tried the fried pickles and damn.. Same problem. Now, you would expect the fries to be salty too, but nope. They were actually pretty good. Now I don't like giving places bad reviews, but this place is definitely not one of the best in the area. So many other good burger joints to try around the valley, this one isn't really worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered thru post mates
Order got confirmed 
Even got a msg from restaurant 
About an item sold out asking if i want something nd i did...
An hour later food never arrived order got cancelled because restaurant was closed 
Waisted an hour of my life 
Will not recommend using postmates or this restaurant they clearly dont care bout us the costumers.
Good bye smashburger your food is mediocre as well ..."}
{"text":"This location just opened in the past year.  I've had Smashburger before, when I lived in Vegas.  I finally got around to eating at this location.  I decided to order the Arizona Big Smashburger, $6.99 and Fries, $1.99.

The Arizona Big Smashburger is pretty good...comes with Guacamole and fresh cut Jalapenos.  It has a nice kick to it....and tastes different than most Burgers you find out there.  The Guacamole is fresh and rich....adds a creamy smooth texture and compliments the sharpness of the Jalapeno.

The Fries are average at best.

This place gets very busy.  To avoid the crowds, try coming between meal periods.  Also, the parking lot can get nuts here because it's way too small for this shopping center.....I avoid it on the weekends.

Return Factor - 88%"}
{"text":"Ordered the new French onion burger with crispy Brussels sprouts. My husband got the triple double burger with Brussels sprouts too. The customer service from Sasha was excellent!! She helped explain all the menu."}
{"text":"1 just because of the burger, but 0 for customer service, ordered the mushroom truffle burger without cheese, they made it with cheese. I had already said it twice to the cashier but I guess she forgot to put it in, then I go to the pick up area to change it to no cheese, then it comes back with NO BUN, seriously? and so I had asked for a bun for the burger since there was no bun, I literally saw the chef give a annoyed look and threw it on the plate, I know it must be really stressful especially since today is Christmas but you should still suck it up and at least smile instead of giving attitude, and  excuse me this is supposed to be a restaurant, the owner should at least come over and check this area out, my family has been in business for more than 30 years now, if you don't understand how to run your business then maybe you should at least give some proper training to the staff. PS I ended up getting food poisoning as well. Thanks"}
{"text":"I love this place. The burgers taste so good. I always get the classic burger and it beats all other burger places out there. I always get my food right away at this location. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas 4 days 3 nights and we visited Smash burger last night. Their customer service was excellent. Everyone was very personable. Prices were great food lets just say, we really enjoyed it, great taste and flavored just right. I did tell the staff how pleased we were. Gonna visit Vegas again soon. Will be staying at the Rio so we can get the same staff. Great Job you guys continue it."}
{"text":"On my quest to find a good burger for lunch, I decided to eat at SmashBurger because I've always seen it whenever I'm near campus, but all my time I've lived in Vegas (going on my third year now), I really didn't see the need to come in here with In-N-Out being their neighbor. Anyway, I decided to give it a chance and finally ate here. 

Upon entering, I was actually a little surprised at how nice the interior looked. It didn't look like it was going to be much from the outside, but the layout of the place is nice and spacious. It has a modern, well-maintained look.

I ordered the mushroom swiss burger with a side of their smash fries.

The mushroom swiss burger was pretty tasty. I decided to go all out and asked if they could incorporate a fried egg in my burger, which they gladly obliged to do! I wish the egg would be a little runny so the yolk would break and add even more flavor to the burger, but this fried egg sufficed (and I guess it's better not being messy lol). The burger buns were soft, the mushroom flavor was there, and the burger patty was juicy -- that's a perfect burger in my book!

Their smash fries were pretty good, too. They were thin shoestring fries that are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. They were cooked to perfection and had a crunch to them (but they weren't burnt or brown-looking). I usually don't like soft fries because they get soggy easily, so this definitely was a good choice for me!

I was delighted that this is near campus because it's super convenient for those in-between-class meals. It's a place to go to if you want a more customizable burger than the burgers at In-N-Out next door. In my opinion, it was worth the visit here and you can't go wrong with a good burger for a decent price!"}
{"text":"I live about 1 mile away from this location, we eat there approximately once a week, only because it is that convenient. The food itself is usually pretty decent, however the atmosphere, is always dirty. There never trash receptacles for the customers to get Reese, and nobody comes to offer to take things from you for me a tray there's no where to dispose of trash. so if you have to blow your nose or you have dirty napkins you have to keep them at the table with you because there are no trash receptacles. I don't believe that that is sanitary at all."}
{"text":"Its only spot open for breakfast besides Starbucks in this little food court area. Everything else opens at 11am for lunch. 
Smash burger had their breakfast burger options until 11am as well. There's only 3 items to choose from: the egg and cheese sandwich, bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, and the breakfast burger. 
I got the breakfast burger which had patty, egg, and cheese. It was pretty good, but super tiny and pricey for its size. But then again, what isn't overpriced in Vegas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Seriously they are like a well oiled machine that is working from the minute they open to the time they shove you out the door to close.

My wife and I have been coming here since the day they opened their doors. The food is crazy good and everybody is beyond friendly. Kalia who came over from another local job is probably the best server at any place in the region. 

We love Smash Burger.  The burgers, chicken sandwiches, Tots, and Fries are all divine.  Kudos to the folks here and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I tried the online order for the first time today. My daughters kids meal was missing her drink. My classic burger had onion when I ordered it with no onion and the bag even said no onion. I hate onion and these onions were the most potent onions so even taking them off left the smell and mild taste of onion. Lastly all our food was cold! I was craving a burger today and we debated between Smashburger and Five Guys. Safe to say next time there will be no debate, Five Guys from now on."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger but the young lady was very impatient even though there was no one else in line"}
{"text":"Very deliciousoooo the burger was so yummyyyy I gave 4 * only cuz the fries are too thin that goes for the regular and sweet potato oh and we had the fried pickles those were sooooo good that was the first time I tried em I have always wanted to and glad I did :)"}
{"text":"Have been there a couple of times - didn't realize at first it was a chain/franchise. Burgers are pretty good - especially the Colorado or the Baja. They look and taste hand formed = yay! (nothing worse than a preformed previously frozen meat disc). The best things there are the fries. Love the Smashfries with garlic, rosemary and olive oil and the sweet potato fries. One of these days I'll get to try their shakes. Convenient location with indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I'm sold!  Ordered take-out and everyone loved their burgers!  Superb black bean veggie burger.  Just really great food."}
{"text":"Probably the best fast casual option in the area. Really young staff that is always happy and upbeat they also do a great job explaining the menu and making recommendations. Really great quality food and I don't think you can go wrong with any selection. Also the shakes are amazing. I had a strawberry and peanut butter shake and it was fantastic. As said before great and affordable fast casual experience."}
{"text":"Got the bbq and bacon burger with the spicy buffalo fries the bbq sauce was great the burger was cooked perfect and the fries well lets just say I'll be looking for the seasoning in my nearest grocery store kudos to smash burger.... The guy with the batman watch and punisher pants...."}
{"text":"been here about 2-3 times now... we don't come to desert ridge that often and if we are craving a burger there are many other better burger places so we never think to come here other then when we are shopping. The burgers are delicious and French fries. The hot dog is even delicious that comes in the kids meal. The food comes out pretty quick and the service is great."}
{"text":"We finally tried Smashburger, it's been the talk of the neighborhood.  Living in the vicinity and it's so exciting to have someplace new to try.......we couldn't get in the 1st few weeks, lines out the door.  We 1st tried calling in our orders, but the phones were constantly busy.  

NOW...1st go on smashburger.com and join the smashburger club.  You will receive a coupon for a free entree, basically buy one burger, get one free.  

Week 3-we decided we would order out, so we called in our order and they said it would be ready in 10 mins.  Yipppeeee!  We order the Classic, Truffle Mushroom Swiss and smash fries.  OMG....so delicious.  Now, we know what all the rave is about.  The burgers were cooked perfectly and everything including the bun was delicious.  One note...the fries were a little cold, but we nuked them for approx. 20-25 seconds...they were awesome.  

The atmosphere is not that impressive, so take it to go.  The staff was very friendly and our order was ready when we got there.  We will be back now that we are in the smashburger club.  No special passwords or hand shakes needed."}
{"text":"In my travel group, there seems to be 3 types of people: the gamblers, the shoppers, and the eaters. .. Guess which category I belong to? 

When I dropped off my mom and auntie at the Las Vegas South Outlet, I was overwhelmed with lunch options. There is a long line of eateries parallel to the outlet.  Smashburger seemed the most interesting of the bunch,  so that's where this adventure started. 

The front door is wide open with the air conditioner on. Lighting is on the subdued side with windows only at the front. The convenient restroom is along the wall on the left.  Seating is on lower tables with bench sofas or high tables with bar stools. Service was adequate and satisfactory. Parking is free and there are even reserved stalls for Smashburger! 

I started with the Classic Smash - the original with cheese,  onion, tomato, pickles, lettuce, Smash sauce and ketchup on an egg bun. The onion and pickles were flavorful enough so I didn't taste the special sauce. Overall, the burger seemed average, and I really appreciated the toasted bun.

Next, I had the Signature \"Sin City\" burger with fried egg, special sauce, grilled onions, haystack onions, cheese and Applewood smoked bacon.  As good as it sounds, it was a bit rich so I wasn't able to finish it.

Many people may be wondering why it's called \"smash\" burger. ..it's because the patty is smashed on the grill when it's being cooked to sear the outside and seal the juices in. It apparently works because the patty was moist! 

I had a good experience and I wouldn't mind returning and having an Avocado Club burger or Truffle Mushroom Swiss.  Create your own burger is another option.   ... or should I go shopping?  Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger just the way you like it.  You can customize all the way from bun, cheese, topping, to dressing.  

I ordered a beef burger with American cheese, jalapeño , and chipotle dressing. The beef patty tasted fresh and juicy.  But a bit too salty.  The fries are on the \"boney\" side. 

Overall, a strong 3-star.  I will definite come back for a fast, fresh burger."}
{"text":"I tried Smashburger for the first time and the best description is mixed at best. The store appears clean, the staff courteous,  and the order was quick in preparation. Those qualities alone goes a long way but, I was told by staff that the number one moving product is the \"sin city,\" burger. This burger has the typical angus beef as in the other burgers but is topped with bacon, grilled onions \"hay stack\" and a fried egg. 
Unfortunately,  the preparation of the egg was super greasy,  bacon over done but not burnt. The egg took away from the flavor of the burger. I will eloborate and say that having lived in Japan where eggs on top of burgers and other things is not a new concept. Smashburger in this case just did it poorly. 
The highlight of the visit was the Spinach,  goat cheese salad with added chicken.  This salad was excellent. The chicken was cooked well, the balsamic dressing was strong enough to enjoy the flavor but not overwhelming. 
I will give Smashburger another try. It is also deserving a high rating for service, staff, and facility. I will forever stay away from the sin city burger.  It truly lived up to its name because it was a sin how it was prepared and tasted."}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Jalapeño Baja Chicken Burger and it was SO delicious! If you like spicy foods and chicken, this is the burger for you. The fries are magnificent and the shakes are perfect! Love the environment here and especially the food. YUM! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A good mix between fast food and restaurant atmosphere. Employees are extremely nice and pleasant to eat there. Good real juicy burgers that taste fresh and can get a bit messy. A nice change of pace in the burger world."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time at this location. 3 Strikes I'm Out!

The first time computers were down.
Second time grissly chicken.
Today, third time, computers down again.

Will not be returning which is a shame because I LOVE Smashburger."}
{"text":"The service is good and the food is okay... Sometimes the burgers can be a little dry by other than that it's okay for a fast meal."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and great customer service.  I've only been there once and I'm sure I will be back again.."}
{"text":"When I first went to Smashburger, I had heard of the national chain, but never had the opportunity to try it, so I was really looking forward to this experience.

Let me say right off the bat that the veggie burger knocked my socks off. I usually expect a dry, flat and tasteless exercise in trying to sooth all customers, but this has great flavor, texture and lots of extras! Loved getting it on the egg bun with chipotle sauce, avocado, spinach and kosher dill pickles. The fries were fresh and tasty. Will have to go back and try one of the tempting shakes, but knew it was a bit too much for this meal.

Smashburger is a bit pricier than the usual fare, but worth every bite. I highly recommend this destination."}
{"text":"Good, but doesn't beat Five Guys. Fresh ingredients and fairly small portions so you won't get too stuffed. The hamburger patties are kinda like Wendy's (and, hey, I like Wendy's so that's good). Sweet potato fries and Smashfries are not even close to the Cajun fries at Five Guys. Serve yourself float was yummy. Good if you're in the neighborhood, but next time I'm near there I still wanna try Create."}
{"text":"1. Worst service negative nasty woman behind counter. SOURPUSS FACE AND ATTITUDE.

2. Cold smashfries and burger was cold.

3. Got an attitude when asked for fresh food. Which was still lukewarm.

4. Store was dirty. Kid working there walked around like a zombie.

5. Heartburn from nasty food.

6. Hopes the owner reads this. Islands is across the way. And yardhouse.."}
{"text":"The burgers were greasy and not flavorful, the shakes were good, and the fries were avg at best. 45 dollars for 4 people was crazy. I could make better burgers at home. I will not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"i always hear about this place and the Hype that goes along with it so i stopped in to get a good burger.  for a place that was pretty empty it took a while to get our food.  The sweet potato fries were very good, i will say that, but the burger was pretty thin and i think they hoped all of the toppings on the list would hide that, but it didn't.

the burger was \"ok\", nothing special but i won't be going back"}
{"text":"Soooo... Definitely coming back. I was visiting my parents and they were wanting cheeseburgers. I mentioned that SmashBurger was close, so I was given cash and shooed off in their direction.

My boyfriend and I ordered 4 burgers and 2 fries to go. It took about 10 minutes to get the food, super quick. I got the black bean burger w/ avocado and my boyfriend got the chicken, avocado club; the other two burgers were simple bacon, cheeseburgers. 

I loved my burger, so tasty. I made sure it was on the chipotle bun to get some extra bite. So delicious and filling, the patty was massive! My boyfriend got the haystack onions on his sandwich and they were so cripsy and salty. Just how I like. Oh, he liked them too ;P

As far as the fries, we got the smash fries and a regular fry. I would probably go with the sweet potato fries next time. The smash fries were super oily and and not very garlicy. I did like them, just too oily for me. I understand, since they are tossed in olive oil. 

Overall, very tasty, somewhat pricey. Worth it. I'll smash another one of their burgers in the future :)"}
{"text":"This is not a bad joint. The only set up is very similar to Chipotle (around the corner). A bit noisy and they are vacuuming while we are eating.  The burgers a tasty and the salad was over drenched in dressing. Next time dressing on the side. Original fries are great. Only thing is $20 for 2 meals. Not bad but not great either. Clean and friendly staff. Good location next to Harkins Theater.  Okay experience."}
{"text":"Good burgers, but the sides are somewhat greasy.  Been here numerous times and while the burgers are good, the sides been inconsistent.  Instead of crisp onion stack and smash fries, they have lately been sitting in grease.  Disappointing especially since they raised the prices."}
{"text":"Worst smash experience I have had. They are great off the strip but I was shocked by how horrid they were. Would not let me make any changes to my order. Never gave me a reciept. I finished my shake well before I got my food. Pager went off 20 mins before order was ready. Food took almomst 40mins to prepare.  I thought was as a little odd for a chocken sandwich and fries. Asked for a refund instead of the food and they refused. I would say with so many food offerings on the strip skip out on this location."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful, they came and checked on us often. The food was very good, we had the fried pickles for the appetizer, and a buffalo ranch chicken sandwich and a burger. They have a new payment system which is really convenient and easy to use!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I love their Avocado BLT burger, fries, and water. Their sweet potato fries are also bomb! I've been in Tempe for about a week and realized the bad quality of water present here. Or maybe there's just really good water in California idk. Anyways this place has tasty water and there employees are super nice."}
{"text":"I was going to give this location a second chance at redemption, only to have the expectation fall short once again. A few weeks ago, my co-worker and I stopped in for lunch. We noticed the line was 10 people deep before we entered, and 5-6 additional people joined the line behind us. After waiting about 5 minutes with no one at the register, I asked the people in front of us if they had been helped, to which their response was, \"no one has been here and we have waited at least five minutes.\" After waiting another 10 min, and observing one employee standing at the service window, my co-worker asked, \"are you guys open for business, and is there a reason no one is taking orders?\" The response was, \"we are backed up in the kitchen with online orders, so it will be 15 minutes before anyone can be helped.\" Not only is this unacceptable, but we had just burned more than 15 minutes of our lunch hour with no communication from their staff as to the delay. Needless to say, everyone in line walked out the door and went elsewhere. At an average of $10/meal, it's an easy estimation of how much revenue was lost from this poor guest experience.
Today, we decided to give this place another try, and when we walked in, the scene was all too familiar. The same girl at the service window (moving at a snails pace, I might add) and no one taking orders. After another 5 minute wait, another associate finally came to the front register to take orders. Neither employee took notice of the urgency to get the business lunch crowd in and out in a timely manner. We waited another 5-8 minutes at the table, which is understandable, but even with that, I counted less than 10 tables of guests in the entire restaurant. I also took note that two people came in and placed to-go orders and I was more than halfway through my meal before they were given their orders. My burger was good but the smash fries were saturated in oil, and came out soggy. I am very disappointed because the food is usually better, but the service is the reason that I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"The food was good. I had an \"Arizona\" (spicy), which was good, although I don't think it was really worth the money. Their fries and milkshakes are delicious!

The service was lukewarm :/"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife. Had the Mushroom Swiss w/bacon, chili cheese fries, and fried pickles. They call themselves Smash Burger because they smash the meat when they cook it to lock in the juices. Anyone who knows how to cook a burger knows when you smash it, it dries it out, which was the case here. Turned out to be dry. Not bad flavor though. The fries were shoestring variety and overall were not very good. The fried pickles were a big disappointment. May as well have just taken the lid off of the salt shaker and eaten a spoonful because all it tasted like was salt. Dining room was nice and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"I am adding to my original post here, because the manager reached out to me to apologize for the atmosphere and chaos that went on the night we were in.  His reply was as follows:  
\"Hi Michael, I'm sorry for the bad experience you had at our restaurant. I assume you were here Sunday night when we had a former employee come in and vandalize our restroom. 

The use of adult language should never have been used in the front of house the way you're saying it was. I was the working Manager last night and feel completely embarrassed that you had to be a witness to that kind of spectacle. 

We've had to deal with so many headaches since we've opened and are constantly trying to iron out the kinks within our staff and procedures.\"
He went on to comp us a meal for our bad experience.  I appreciate the management looking out and taking time to correct mistakes.  And I can certainly appreciate the difficulties of finding good employees especially with a grand opening.  I will give them another shot and update or delete this post based on that visit...

I will NOT be  back...  This place needs new management and staff already!  I was there this past weekend and the place was a zoo, not with customers with employees who were having a free for all!  We got to the restaurant and placed our order, that experience was fine.  The total for 2 was $30+ which I thought was a bit high for a fast food burger, fries, and a drink but I am fine with that amount.  However we then sat down to witness the mess that this place is.  We were there with a 1 year old and employees, including who I believe to be the manager were walking around swearing.  An employee was about to fight a customer, who I'm unsure but may have been an ex-employee in the store.  I went to use the restroom and had to wade through employees sitting and standing around talking in appropriately and not moving to let me the customer through.  Once I got to the restroom there was an employee in the stall on the phone cursing up a storm.  

I'm not a prude and I could give a s$&t less about swearing but have some common courtesy for customers, especially ones with kids.  Move out of the way when someone is attempting to walk down a hall.  Just common manner, I have a real problem when I feel people have no manners or respect.  And that is the vibe I got here.  If I was the manager I would have fired at least 5 employees for actions during the 20 minutes I was there.  

There was only one other table at the restaurant eating and there were at least 15 employees working, 10 of which were lollygagging around BSing.  

The food wasn't bad, although I understand where the SMASH in Smash Burger comes from.  My stomach was killing me that night...

I will stick to five guys, red robin, or wingharts.  Same price better atmosphere! 

If ownership does their job and cleans a lot of house I might consider visiting again."}
{"text":"I have only been to Smashburger 3 times.  The first two times were meh, but my most recent visit was disgusting.  I ordered the Sin City Chicken, no bun.  My supposedly 'grilled chicken breast' was gray in color and tasted like paste.  It was so disgusting I could not eat it.  Luckily my friend ordered the veggie frites  (carrots and green beans, flash fried) so I snagged a few of those.  When an employee came to take our plates, she asked if I wanted a box.  I advised that the chicken did not look or taste right.  She said she had heard that a couple of times today but offered nothing.  Who knows if they had a bad batch of chicken or if it's always like that.  My pictures really don't really depict the true grayness of this chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice and both times found the food to be excellent (highly recommend the Arizona burger if you like it hot and spicy!), the service is speedy, the staff is eager, helpful and upbeat.  Jalissa was particularly helpful, efficient and courteous.  The staff works together in a way that says they like their job and are happy to be there working with the public -- all in all, a refreshing stop for a memorable, modest meal."}
{"text":"smashburger smashes the competition!!!!

once again, they do not disappoint..... we are talkin a good solid burger here... the beef is great quality that you can taste!

I gotta say, i have eaten my fair share of over a thousand burgers and this joint is on top!  1st level as my gramma says.....

and the sin city burger? should be a sin to eat it, i mean c'mon.... fried egg? onion strings? BACON?  damn that's a good burger......

but it's all about the BEEF, and this here is some tasty stuff.... and you can choose 1/3 lb or 1/2 lb patty....

and the chili fries? damn good with fresh jalapenos...

in this town, i have to say.... smashburger is the hot spot.

burger up!

But the manager is so terrible and every time I come in and he's here I seriously want to just leave, he makes your ordering experience so uncomfortable. His attitude sucks the way he talks to people is so rude. How he's the manager I have no idea.
He raised his voice at me and I raised it right back at him but the looks he gives you is so disrespectful I can't stand it..
I love you smash burger but your choice in management is extremely poor."}
{"text":"just ate there the other day and i was very happy with the service they provided after there was some confusion about what i had ordered, they sent it back it, fixed it, and it was delicious. smash burger is not the healthiest of places since it has a lot of grease but it does hit that hang over spot."}
{"text":"Went back again, same great service as before, very busy lunch hour and yet service was fast, place was clean, and they had plenty of people working .  

Food was great, my ONLY complaint was that I ordered bacon on Burger for an extra $1.50 and got ONE PIECE broken into 4 small strips.  I asked a manager if that was really $1.50 worth of bacon and he said yes, then brought me another \"serving\" which I thought was very good service, but I'll know next time not to waste the $$$.

We had build it yourself large burger, SMASHFRIES that are excellent!, and soda and wife had Arizona burger and fried pickles and soda.  Bil was $23.50 (much more expensive than regular fast food but worth it occasionally.

Burgers are greasier than most places, which I think makes them better.  It was the first meal after a 36 hour fast for a medical test and it was awesome:)
BYOB: \"Bring Your Own Bacon\" :)"}
{"text":"First time at smash burger. ABSOLUTELY delicious!!!!! Everything was super fresh! Not too greasy! Even the baby LOVED IT! Burger.. 93/7% delicious fries, not greasy, Haagon Dazs ice cream milk shake freshly made and they give you the remains of the milk shake in the cup they mixed it in. Absolutely AMAZING experience!"}
{"text":"Was craving a burger and thought I could get it here. The menu pics glorified their burgers too much as the final product looked like a standard fast food burger! Taste was decent but was looking for something of higher quality as they advertise themselves to be."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our burgers. Should have shared French fries rather than get 3 orders. Lots left over. Did not realize each was a separate order. Had milk shakes. Good but again, not inexpensive. Would definitely go back. Next time we will watch what we order and have less waste."}
{"text":"One of the worst franchises I have visited.  Food is very inconsistent.  Customer loyalty program is a farce.  

Last straw was yesterday in my to go order.  All burgers were extremely overcooked as were the sweet potato fries.  I went back with receipt provided and they would not refund my money.  Manager Christopher said a lot of people ask for their money back?  Said they were closing this location anyway.  Such was his explanation and his version of service.  

Avoid.  Go to 5 Guys for a decent burger and excellent customer service."}

{"text":"Lunch with Boo! Fast, friendly and hot! Great casual place for a quick burger and tots! Classic burger, added pickles, lettuce and sharp cheddar cheese. Tots were cooked perfectly, slightly crisp! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I took my son to Smash Burger for lunch today, and we both thought that it was very good, but not exactly inexpensive. You place your order and they bring it to your table, just like at FatBurger. My son had the regular classic (5.99) and I had the big spicy baja (7.99).  We also had their sides, which today; were the french fries (2.49), veggie frites (3.99) and the beefy chili (3.99). The only problem we had, was that the fries were not hot, which I am sure due to the table delivery. If they had been hot, The fries are cut thin, not quite as thin as those at InNout.  I think they would have been very close to the fries that InNOut serves, which means they were pretty darn good. The servers and cashiers were very friendly and professional. The burgers were quite tasty, as was the beefy chili and vegetable frites. They do offer chicken, hot dogs, fresh salads, shakes and floats made with McKay's ice cream and they also have beer ((3.99 a bottle) and wine (4.99 a glass). I should have tried the traditional poutine (3.99) to see how it stacked up, but I had ordered so many items already that I just could not eat anymore, and I still had to take some stuff home.
Update, after a second visit with a friend to Smash Burger.  We ordered the poutine and onion rings sides. The onion rings were lightly battered and were excellent. The poutine would have been excellent if the cheese curds had been in the gravy long enough to allow them to be hot and slightly melted, unfortunately some of the curds were quite large and cold. Even this way the pouting was still pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I usually get the Arizona Smashchicken or the Arizona Cobb Salad.  Both are always delicious!  Sometimes they are really spicy and other times not so much.  I guess it depends on who is making it and how many jalapenos get in there.   The chicken is really flavorful, unlike a lot of other chicken sandwiches/salads where the chicken is bland and adds nothing to the meal.  I think I am the only person I know that isn't a fan of the Smashfries.  They are generally tasty, but I would far prefer regular fries.  I really like this place, but its a little pricey for what you get.  Lunch for two will probably set you back a least $20... its not too bad, but your $20 will go a lot further other places."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular Smashburger location and another one in a shopping plaza at 5655 Centennial Center Boulevard which also has a Trader Joe's located conveniently nearby.

My father, who never consumed large portions of anything in his old age, found the Mushroom Swiss Burger served by this franchise to be so tasty that he simply could not resist eating the entire sandwich - an extremely rare occurrence.

Thus, also based on my own personal lip-smacking experience with this item, the Mushroom Swiss Burger comes highly recommended - absolutely delicious!"}

I just get the regular cheeseburger with everything on it and fries, and that's good enough for me. I'm not going to try and get all fancy with my food after I've been drinking at a club for 4 hours and I just need something to eat. Food is good, the location is good, it's a little overpriced for what you get (again, it's on the strip so of course it's going to cost more), but the service kind of sucks. Oh well, I guess I can't blame them after they're constantly dealing with drunk and obnoxious people all day lol. Anyway good place to go to if you just need a quick bite or in my case, a place to eat after drinking for hours on end!"}

{"text":"First time to a Smashburger. Liked the variety on the menu. The veggie frites were very good. Something different. The bbq cheddar burger was nothing special particularly the meat patty. In and out is much better. At the higher price point you would expect Smashburger to be better. It was not. Front counter service was good. Watching one cook take off his hat and run his hand through his hair and the other cook wiped his mouth with his hand. They do not use gloves so this was pretty disgusting."}

No kidding- you can't come here without trying those fries."}
{"text":"The service was good but I was not impressed with the food. I found the burger to be salty, crumbly and messy. The fries were nothing to scream about, but then again I don't like shoestring fries. I would not recommend. I don't see the hype. I won't be back."}

Waited 15 mins for our order (2 burgers 2 fries) until the cashier came to our table to apologize for the wait and said it would be right out. 10 mins later 1 order came out, then the manager came to our table to ask what was missing. 5 mins later he comes back to ask again what the missing order was. 10 mins after that he finally brings the burger and fries. At no point did he apologize for the wait. We normally really like the food but this time it was not up to standard. My burger was supposed to have haystack onions which it did, totaling 4 small pieces like they had run out. Also I ordered smash fries and it seems the cook put the smash seasoning on the paper and dumped the fries on top because none of the fries had the seasoning on them. My husbands burger was burnt and had the same issue with the haystack onions. Lastly I had ordered a large fry and he ordered a regular but the same quantity came for both our sides. I have ate a SmashBurger several times and they have always done a good job of quality control in the past. One time a cashier at a different location had miscounted my change and when I went back to the store to let her know she gave no argument, gave the proper change, and offered a free side for the inconvenience. The only exception in service was the cashier Felicity, she was very nice and the only one to apologize."}

{"text":"Nothing near the best. I still would take an In-n-Out burger over this any day. Created my own BLT burger w/ smash sauce and smash fries.  At first bite, the burger was good - maybe I was really hungry.  Anyhow, towards the end of the meal I felt like I was shovelling mounds of salt into my mouth - between the burger patty and the fries, there was just way too much salt.  Not sure if this is the taste they are going for - it's not my preference.  It was good to try, but I probably won't be back when I need a burger fix.  Two burgers and two fries w/ one drink totaled a little over $20 for me and hubby.  For the price, it is not worth it - for that price, red robin quality is what's more on par to fit that bill.

To make things more worse, I get home to see that a friend also tried this spot and had a way more worse outcome than heavy salt.....YUCK.

Dear Smashburger Employees,
lighten your hand with the salt pouring and please please PLEASE wear your g-damn hairnets!!

....makes me appreciate the cleanliness consistency of In-n-Out that much more."}
{"text":"Our food was ready lightning quick, but the sweet potato fries had clearly been sitting around for a while and my black bean patty was extremely paste-like; globs of it fell off the bun as I ate. The smashed fries were amazing and the rest of my truffle burger was incredible tastewise, but the smeared paste black bean \"patty\" and stale fries kinda killed it for me."}
{"text":"1 Double smash Burger. 1 Chicken smash Burger. 2 orders of smash fries. 1 Oreo shake. 1 soda. = $43.73.  Really??? A 22oz soda for $4.95?? 

I understand it's the Caesars food court in Las Vegas, but this pretty ridiculous. At this point, we might as well have gone to a sit down restaurant like Gordon Ramsey's Pub And Grill for a proper size burger and proper size fries! 

The Burger itself is small, reminiscent of the size of a McDonald's burger patty.  Albeit, fresher QUALITY. The taste was mildly salty and the smash fries tossed in salt and rosemary were tasty, yet again on the smaller side. The Oreo shake was great. Made with real big chunks of Oreo and ice cream. However the service was so so. 

I've been to other Smash Burgers before and probably will go to to other Smash Burgers, but I don't think I want to pay another $45 bucks for burgers and fries at this Smash Burger."}

{"text":"Smashburger took over the spot in Desert Ridge previously occupied by Fatburger.  Since I have an aversion to restaurants with 'fat' in the name I was happy to see a new burger spot to try.

So far, the food is good.  The menu offers an assortment of burgers, chicken sandwiches and sides.  I have enjoyed:

- Mushroom Swiss burger - a flavorful and juicy beef patty, garlic sauteed mushrooms and swiss cheese served on an egg bun.

- Fries - nice and crisp, seasoned with sea salt.

- Haystack onions - onion strings with a tangy dipping sauce.  If you like onion rings, you will love these!

While the food is good and the service is quick and friendly, the restaurant itself kind of spoils the experience.  It feels cramped inside (weird layout of entrance/line/counter and drink dispensers), and on both of my visits many tables needed to be cleaned.  Trash cans were stuffed to nearly overflowing, and many of the condiment bottles were empty.  

I appreciate that the staff is delivering orders from the kitchen quickly, but taking a few minutes to wipe tables and empty trash would make a big difference in the small space.  Nobody likes to sit down at a sticky table.  

As the location is so close to the movie theater, I am sure I will give it another try - hopefully I won't need to bring my own Clorox wipes!"}

I just cannot fathom how they can charge $5.99 for a salad, and charge an additional $2 to add chicken to it. The amount of chicken you get does not amount to $2 worth. 

If Smashburger had prices more on par with their competitors, I would probably eat there more often."}

Alright. I was delaying my review of SmashBurger since I am pretty certain I am going to be relegated to come here often. 

The service is outstanding. Truly. A gem. In-N-Out-esque; no doubt about it. Now the burgers are another thing though.

So far I have tried four different burgers and they are not In-N-Out-esque. Really, it is unfair to compare since they are completely different, but they are across the street from each other (at multiple locations, incl. Centennial). Yelp check-in offer (10% off) helps a little, but SmashBurger is still strangely over*priced when their competitor has superior, better priced product just across the street. 

I cannot recall which burgers I got when, but what I can say is that they were underwhelming subpar for how much SB charges. And the atmosphere with all the damn school aged children everywhere; not exactly a positive. 

Back to the burgers: 

BBQ, Bacon, Cheddar:
Ordered it with avocado and they thought that meant three tiny slivers of aquacate. Since I got a respectable amount of avocado in the Avocado Club, I figured for the 1$ add-on I would get the same amount. Wrong. It was very cold, as if it was just taken out of refrigeration right before being placed on my bun. Bacon had an obscene amount of fat (at least 75% lipid) and were not crunch in those parts. 

Avocado Club: 
Ordered it with a fried egg (it was cooked HARD with no softness to the yolk in sight) and avocado which was adequate but it's not like they at SB made it. They should take lessons from Fuku Burger on how to properly prepare a fried egg en Burger. 

Sweet potato fries: they are alright. Nowhere near as good as Burger Bar. But a more consistent side to choose than their signature smashfries, in my opinion.  

SmashFries: Sometimes they are better than other times. Sometimes they are way too soggy and drenched in olive oil. Really hit or miss.

Dessert: they don't have any so that's that. 

Maybe their chicken is better, although I doubt it. 

In sum - average burgers, well above average prices. Guess this could be a decent option if you are vegetarian/vegan because of their black bean burger. - E"}
{"text":"First off, this Smashburger (SB) is one of the only in the valley where the ten percent (10%) Yelp check-in offer is not available. (Thanks for nothing, Tom Ryan!) Maybe the rent is too damn high. (Doubt it.) 

Secondly, it is cute to see so many students checking this restaurant out. Not sure where were they when it was a small, local Mexican restaurant (recently shuttered), but now it is a popular international chain so they can be found stumbling over themselves to get over here from CSN (no, not Crosby, Stills & Nash).

Now that I have stated those two points ... 

Smashburger
It is nice there is a place for a burger right near campus. I cannot think of another option before SB. In any case, here we have one now. 

There is not much to say about the food. It is a chain for fucks sake! The burger is the same here as it is at Maryland Parkway, as it is in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, or in Kuwait City, Kuwait. 

It is alright. The fries are alright. The shakes are alright. The ketchup packaging is brilliant. Five (5) stars for the ketchup packaging!  

The wait here seems to be interminably longer when compared to other SB locations I have been to for take-out. Maybe they need to work some kinks out -- I would hate for this location to be the training facility or to appear to function as a training facility for the chain -- but, there was no queue when I have come here, and, yet I still have to wait a bit too long for my food. 

I would take to the stopwatch to document precisely how long they are taking to get the food out, but I would hate to be accused of being overly pedantic. It is taking long; take my word for it. 

Or don't. But you are the one that is going to be late to your class or back to work after lunch. (You're fired!)"}
{"text":"Went to Smashburger for the first time with my family today, we had a wonderful experience. The cashier was above and beyond wonderful to my children and us. They were great and so was the food, I ordered a classic burger with their signature \"smash\" fries when it came I thought the burger was pretty little but it did its job, I was full and it was pretty good. Their fries were good just not my taste I'll be going back and getting regular. Their customer service alone is why I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I had Ordered the wrong fries they fixed it quickly .there shakes are awesome specially the peanut butter shake"}
{"text":"First off, I have been here a few times and the Arizona burger never disappoints me.
I would give the Arizona burger 4 stars. I would say it is 5 stars for flavor and 3 stars for size and value of the burger.

This visit I was with my 4 year old who loves hot dogs and he didn't care for the kids meal hot dog.  It was very dry and the bun fell apart on his first bite.
After he ate half of it and I finished it and I agree it was nothing special.  I would prefer the $1.50 hot dog from Costco.

The worst part was there was a long brown hair in my burger. Maybe the cooks should wear hairnets??? They replaced it without any questions, but I was surprised the manager on duty didn't apologize.

I finally ate my burger which was the Arizona burger.  I ordered the BIG burger and it taste great but is far from big.

I will go back if I'm not so hungry and crave a burger because they do taste good.
But if you have a big appetite plan on ordering 2 or 3."}
{"text":"Super long wait today (30+minutes behind 4 people) because a lady had a Groupon and the only cashier / floor manager / restaurant manager couldn't figure out how to process it.

Instead of helping the customer, in one of the many ways they could have and/or opening their second register, every employee on the floor congregated, inconveniencing every customer in the restaurant.

On top of that, they messed her order up anyhow.

No concessions were given for the inconvenience when I asked the cashier. I didn't stomp and pout because there was a long line behind me, and I didn't want to inconvenience them. They want to eat and go their way too.

I've eaten here many times in the past, but never brought my child.
The child burger consisted of: bun, no sauces, burger and cheese. - no lettuce, no tomato, no onion, nothing.
It's my fault for assuming a $5.59 kids combo would have more. Ketchup and mustard we're available at the table. Ketchup=vegetable I guess. I didn't come to a burger joint to eat healthy, right?

Oh hey.. I finished eating, typed this review...and the lady mentioned above just got her order fixed. I like the food here, but I won't be waiting for my food again with a few really good restaurants next door."}

{"text":"Great burgers made to order and built with options. A list of multiple options is provided when ordering. I usually go for all the options that are bad for your health like mayonnaise, bacon, fried onion straws, and fried eggs. Tried the fried pickles and thought it to be tasty when dipped in creamy ranch dressing. Fried pickles without the ranch sauce has a bitter bite to it. Big selection of milkshakes and options as well. Great helpful and friendly customer service."}

Wife and I went here last night and witnessed the staff get everyone's order wrong including ours. There was at least 8 orders before us or after us and everyone had issues. 

Wife and I each ordered a burger and we got a salad to share. Her burger and the salad came out. My burger never did. When I grabbed my receipt I noticed it wasn't even taken down correctly. I flagged down a female employee to ask about my burger. When I tried explaining that the order was incorrect she grabbed the receipt from me and said I'll get it before I could even make sure it would be correct.

The burger came out and it was wrong. They offered to bring out the toppings on the side that I had requested and when they came back they were still wrong.

Needless to say, if we ever decide to go back to another Smashburger it won't be this location."}
{"text":"Another great burger from Smashburger..we spent the day on the lake enjoying the pontoon and I ordered on my phone three Baja burgers from the Stonecrest store. They were delicious...I can rave enough about them. They were juicy and fresh cooked and hot and covered with jalapenos and guac! Just wonderful. We got the bigger ones and it was so worth it! Try this place its so much better than the rest of them!!"}
{"text":"Hey try their triple burger with the pretzel bun! It is only $4.00! It was yummy! That is really a great deal! No coupon that is the price. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Alright Phoenix, it's time to stop losing your collective shit over Smashburger. I'll probably get crucified for saying this, but does anyone else out there feel like they're eating McDonalds when they're having a Smashburger?

Now don't get me wrong, McDonalds isn't quite as greasy or salty tasting as Smashburger, but the two still are very similar. Oh, except one thing, McDonalds fries are way better. Every time I've had fries from Smashblah they are over fried, making them too stiff and tasteless. Plus this place is way over priced. So I guess that's two differences.

Put it this way, if Delux or Rocket Burger were next door to Smashburger, then 10 times outta 10, I'm passing by Smashburger and going to the other places.  Now, if McDonalds was right next door to Smashburger...yeah, I'd probably still skip Smashburger and save my money."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times. The food is kind of pricey but it's worth it. The Smash Fries are the best and the milkshakes are delicious."}
{"text":"They should consider hiring more. 
We've been in a growing line for 7 mins, with no one at the register. People were leaving! 
The employee wiping tables, one customer approached and asked where the cashier is, her answer was they were short staffed. 
Three minutes later, that same employee comes up to the register to take out order!!! Rude AF Jackie!!!!! Would rather wipe down tables than take our order."}
{"text":"I used to stop by at this place multiple times in a week, sometimes depending on the coupons available In the Smashburger Mobile app I used to use them, but all of the sudden just this store had stopped using all the coupons & the silly reason given by the store manager named Francisco is their scanner stopped working to scan the coupons which they not at all use to do it earlier, it shows how reckless they treat their customers by misleading in a wrong way. Staff present in the store are not even responding back to me properly bcaz they might thought that I will reach out to the corporate headquarters. Also they told me this was only retail store which don't accept the coupons, where they got instructed to do by that franchise owner. My sincere suggestion to all valued customers is not to stop by such kind of false business."}
{"text":"Went to eat at your location and waited at register for service. The person came out only when phone rang and ignore my wife and I who were waiting prior to phone ringing.  After taking some time to take somebody's order on phone, she then turned to me without apology. There was no apology for answering the phone first, she didn't give me eye contact and ask for permission to take a phone first, ignored me till she was off phone.  I asked her why she put call first over customer who was there waiting before call and she replied; I'm required to do this.  She didn't apologize, and made no effort to recognize the problem of taking phone calls over patients in front of her.  I asked to speak to manager so I could Voice my concern over this lack of social etiquette. Stephanie was The Night Manager tonight, and she said the exact same words as her employee. I then said so you're saying that the customer on the phone takes precedent over The customer who there first standing in front of the register. She then stated she has to take the phone ahead of customers that are already in line waiting. I don't know if this is a millennial generation problem or  if this is a company who is just oblivious to what is appropriate.  I voiced my complaint and turned around and left because I couldn't trust that they wouldn't spit in my food after I chastised them.  I plan on writing a letter to the franchise Headquarters but wanted other customers to see this complaint. I wonder if you all are having the same problem."}
{"text":"In football terms, this place seems to be our third string quarterback in our choice of restaurants.    Its good, its different, it got this far: Its definitely good enough to play, but I don't feel this guy is going to win the big game.    but we keep driving by it every day when we choose to eat out.    

Its different.    Good, but different.   I dunno what it is, but its just A-OK.    My palate doesn't explode with joy or anything each time.   If I want a different burger, I'll try something else out."}
{"text":"Nothing to get excited about. Burgers were very salty. Nothing tasted amazing and they didn't have honey for the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Not \"instant\", but fresh made burgers may be the very best in the burger chain bidness. A definite cut above the big three with selections like a black bean veggie burger that I actually LIKE, and the burger with spinach, goat cheese and cucumber.  The sweet potato fries give me a satisfying delusion of comparative healthfulness that helps balance out the utter guilty pleasure of those  blessed/cursed Haagen Daz shakes.  Thought the mushroom-swiss a little disappointing and if you don't care for onion, you may want to skip the Arizona burger as well.  The Az burger is food photo worthy - actually looks like a promotional picture, and has a little heat from a chipotle sauce or cheese, but with the big slab of breath-destroying onion removed, is otherwise tasteless, avocado spread notwithstanding.  

Consistently clean place with friendly young staff.  My service has always been great but I've noted confusion and errors in other's orders on several occasions at 59th & W T'bird though staff apologized and made it right on all occasions.  

Even at its worst, it's hard to think of going back to Jack after you've been Smashed."}
{"text":"Does the world really need another fast food hamburger chain restaurant review? Well, maybe not, but after four checked in visits plus a few others to this location, I'm ready to convey compliments.  The burgers are among the best in the business, the Haagen Daz shakes a delicious indulgence, and the sweet potato fries a favorite.  
The burgers probably come the closest to the advertising posters of any I've seen, with the bread/buns not being a steamed wet, compressed shadow of what appears on the posters and burgers consistently big, juicy, and tasty, and the add on lettuce & tomato consistently fresh and not chintzy in application.  The Classic Smash is a great burger, and I can vouch well for the mushroom and swiss, the spinach and goat cheese, and even though not particularly veggie oriented, I liked the black bean burger enough that I've ordered it more than once as well.   
In addition to my favorite sweet potato fries, the \"regular\" house fries doused with olive oil, rosemary and garlic are a pleasing twist on the traditional.   I haven't tried enough of the chicken sandwiches to venture an opinion, but they're available in basically the same variations as the burgers: classic, avocado, BBQ, bacon & cheddar, buffalo & blue cheese, spicy jalopeno, spinach & goat cheese, mushroom & swiss. I have yet to sample the salads, fried pickles, veggie frite thingies, the spicy buffalo fries or onion rings. 
For burger or chicken sandwich alone, expect $6 or $7.  Add fries and a drink or shake and your total can easily go over $10 - still, in my humble opinion, generally a better burger with better accompaniments.  This location has been consistently clean, and the young staff polite and proficient in their service on all occasions."}
{"text":"Just went to this location!
Mushroom swiss burger had so much grease dripping from it used about 20 napkins to clean it up so it could be eaten. Had onion straws with just as much grease! The place itself was dirty as well, soda all over the counter and floor at the soda station. Fingerprints and I'm not sure what all over the walls and tables  that were empty had stuff on them. The table we first sat at was so wobbly we had to move. Will not be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"I have visited the Scottsdale & Thomas Smashburger in the past, and come back for the fantastic service and good food. The staff is always friendly and their customer service standards high.

Today was the first time that I have used the online ordering system. The app was easy to use, and it was fantastic that it let you order by complete meals, which they then individually bagged at pick-up. No sorting food out among people! The Avocado Club and AZ burgers were great. Not greasy or messy and cooked perfectly. I was a bit disappointed by the fried pickles, however. They were the saltiest things I've ever eaten! They were also just dropped into the batter and fried by the bunches, leaving you with clumps of pickles and not individual pickles. But the fries and smash fries were great.

The online pick-up area was separate from the regular line, which is good. My bag was ready to go, with ranch, ketchup AND napkins without having to ask. My cups were waiting in a drink carrier. The best was...not one thing in my order was wrong nor missing. I was happy!

I will come back to this location and highly recommend it for a quick bite."}
{"text":"okay

I've been sitting on this review for a while, for which I attributed writer's block.  Then it occurred to me: I wasn't having a hard time describing my experience, nor was I at a loss for words.  It's that Smashburger simply didn't make any memorable impression on me.

I ordered a BBQ bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato fries.  My friend ordered a regular cheeseburger.  Both burgers were cooked well (a little too well for me, but hey, this isn't Burger Bar) and were nice and juicy.  The fries were thin and crisp, with a hint of sugar.  

Everything was fine, nothing \"WOW,\" nor terrible.  Very middle of the road, hence my three stars."}
{"text":"Tried them when they first opened and went back, maybe two other times.  They are good, but not not really worth the price IMO."}
{"text":"This place is bad management.... i mean not responsible for the customer at all. the phone is not picking up and i went to order chicken sandwiches and i specifically ask to put grilled onion on them. See what i got for the third time in a row... Raw onion... Hate row onion like i hate this manager lady at the smash burger. this is the last time i am going to this place,. By bye Smash burgers!! you can screw orders for the other people and say i am sorry! it will make your business very successful!!"}
{"text":"Some restaurants you can go just for the food because eating is the point of having a restaurant to begin with.  Smashburger takes this experience to a new level.   You'll love what they've done to the traditional burger joint.  The atmosphere is unique and delicious.  The food is edgy, hip, and inviting.  Wait ... switch that."}
{"text":"We waited over thirty minutes just to receive our food.  French fries and sweet potato fries were served cold.  Not worth the money or the wait.  Go next door to Chipotle for better food."}
{"text":"First visit and a great visit! Came here for lunch during work and glad that I did. Small selection for a vegetarian but loved the burger I had. Ordered the sweet potato fries to go with my burger and they were delish! 

Atmosphere was cozy and great to match the food. I will be making this a lunch spot for days to come. Excellent! Will have to come during off hours because I noticed they sell Red Fox beer, which is one of my favs!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I loved their burgers. You can customize your burger in any kind of way. The signature Sin City Burger is pretty good and their chicken burgers are my gf's favorite. Try their sweet potato fries if you are never had it before. It is pretty legit in the beginning but becomes a little too much after a while. Their regular fries seems to have onions on them so they are not your average fast food place fries. 

Overall, nice place to have a quick meal. Not entirely a sit down place but definitely better than most of the fast food places. 

Btw, their salad isn't very bad either. But really, how good can a salad be?"}
{"text":"I recently heard someone mention Smashburger and I was curious to give them a try. I was actually really pleased with the burger I ordered the Classic Smash and it was delicious. I also switched up the order a bit; I asked for grilled onion instead of the raw onions and added mushrooms. Let me take a minute and tell you how bomb this burger was..... YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!! The burger had a charcoaled taste so it kind of reminded me of a burger straight off the grill at a cookout or something. I also ordered the French Fries but now looking over the menu I'm sad I didn't try the SmashFries (which are tossed in rosemary, garlic and olive oil) that sounds delicious. I still can't take away from the regular French Fries because they were good. I was a little upset when I reached in my bag and there were no fries left *sad face*. I can't believe I ate them that quick!!

Now for the setup, you walk in they give you instructions on 1) grabbing a menu, 2) to not get to excited about the menu choices (cute; this made me laugh), 3) then telling us to put the menu back when we're ready to order! I didn't really like that because it kind of gave me a bit of anxiety thinking I was going to miss something I wanted. Hence the fact, I definitely missed the SmashFries! Granted there was a menu at the register which I didn't see at first because I was looking up for it but it was right below the cash register. The cashier wasn't very helpful either I again felt rushed and as if she was a little annoyed. But the food made up for the experience."}
{"text":"Not even putting stars. Horrible. Didn't even see a persons face... Waited five mins and no one came from the back... I could see the girl, she could of seen me if she'd looked over her shoulder once...: not the first time I've had shitty service at this smash burger. Don't care if you just opened - someone should always be front of house."}
{"text":"Best burger on the west side of town. The buns are soft and fresh, and the meat has a wonderful flavor. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I remember this place being better. Cold food, including the fries. The girl at the front doesn't want to be there to work.... Everyone mixing up orders... Just go hit up in n out next door.."}
{"text":"This is my second tim here. Good burgers and fries. Good service. Quick with food. I wish they had more seating outside. But definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Smash Burger is not your typical fast food burger.  Ingredients are fresh and cooked when you order.  Prices are a little higher - but you know you are getting a quality product.  The portions are big and the smash fries are amazing.  

Service is great..even when the place is packed."}
{"text":"Dontez, the manager who now is getting his own store in south Scottsdale, is the absolute best!  Friendly and extremely attentive and not only to us.  I watched him interact with various guests to his store as my family and I had lunch there recently.  I remarked to him that he was an awesome employee and he told me it was his last day there and was getting a promotion to run his own store in south Scottsdale.  WELL deserved if you ask me.  I've been in the customer service business for 30 years and he's one of the finest I've seen.  I'd hire him in a split second!  Great job Dontez and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Tried it on a whim, I won't go back. Burger was average, place was kind of trashy. Too much money for what they offer."}
{"text":"3PM, late lunch. Ordered the Truffle Mushroom Swiss burger (Big) with fresh baby arugula and a side of sweet potato fries plus a Saskatoon berry shake. The fries were lightly seasoned with coarse salt, and served with a chipotle mayo dip. Om nom nom. The burger? Tasty, juicy, and piping hot. Service? Friendly, prompt, and efficient. The place? Clean, bright, and cheerful. Yeah!"}
{"text":"I have been torn about trying Smashburger since some of the reviews for their locations have been less than smashing.  Last night, we decided to try something different and decided to try Smashburger.

I looked at the online menu and then went to this location which is near where I live.  I got the avocado club hamburger for myself and the truffle mushroom burger for my wife.  After finding out what Smash fries were, I got an order for each of us.

Sarah was the woman running the register last night and she was good answering my questions.  I'm sure she could tell it was my first time there.  She told me to have a seat and she'd bring the to go order as soon as it was ready.  In about 5 minutes, the order was ready.  Since there was no one else in the restaurant, I knew it was mine.

A short drive home and we were enjoying the hamburgers.  They were good for a change.  They are somewhere in the middle between normal fast food hamburger chains and the upscale hamburger shops which have sprung up around Las Vegas.  The fries were good.

I'm not going to make Smashburger a regular on my rotation schedule, but it was good enough that I'll be back sometime.  I need to try the nutter butter shake."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised at the bad reviews on here.

I consider myself somewhat of a burger connoisseur. Not that I'm tooting my own horn :).

We got there at the right time before it got crowded before a Rebels Bball game. 

I got the mushroom swiss burger, hubby got the BBQ burger and our friend got the Sin City burger.

My burger was delicious!! Juicy, well seasoned, and perfectly cooked. Everyone really enjoyed their burgers. Next time, I will get a fried egg on there since it is an option. 

The FRIES...oh the fries. Soooo good. We got both the regular smashfries and the sweet potato smashfries. Rosemary, olive oil and GARLIC tossed with these crispy strips of joy.

I guess I'm not cool enough to give this franchise a poor score. I was unexpectedly impressed."}
{"text":"Great food, but the service isn't quite there yet. It's definitely not like smash burgers I have been to in other cities"}
{"text":"How is a burger so drenched in oil!! also the cashier and server took a napkin and dipped in a sanitizer bucket with a rag that wipes tables down to wipe a knife at my request, I said to her as being a 18 yr veteran in the food and beverage industry , to not do that. She replies, \"oh no, we have to.\" Really!??? Health inspectors need to review this...never again!"}
{"text":"Pretty pretty good.  :)
I went with a standard burger, and we ordered one order of regular fries and one order of the sweet potato fries.  Easily the best sweet potato fries I've had in a LONG time.  They're seasoned with rosemary and garlic and they're freaking DELICIOUS. 

One small snag when I found a hair on my burger (eww) but the staff went WAY above and beyond in rectifying the situation.  Not only did they give us a coupon for a free burger (you have to pay in advance at the counter so this was easier than removing it from the check), they remade the fries so we wouldn't have to eat cold fries while waiting for the new burger.  At least four employees stopped by the table to make sure we were happy with the solution.  

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"the fries were good.  the chocolate shake tasted more vanilla. it had just enough chocolate to change the color to a very light brown. the burger was over seasoned and old tasting.  the baja salad was was nothing special.  the chicken in the salad was also over seasoned and did not taste freshly grilled .  everything felt like it was thrown together. maybe chef was mad to be cooking on christmas eve. definitely not worth 20.50$."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all, I wouldn't call this a Gourmet Burger, and they are expensive! didn't like the way the meat tasted, too salty, and the french fries were ok, we ordered the Rosemary,Olive oil, and Garlic fries, my husband loves Burgers, but we will not go back !  this was the second time we had tried them!

I will say the Staff was Great, too bad their Burgers are not Great !

We would rather go to In In Out, or Five Guys !
 
They have really Loud Music playing also, which is not very pleasant, my husband and I could barely hear each other talk !"}
{"text":"When it first surfaced here in Las Vegas, burger places were mostly relegated to cheap fast food.  In that era, Smashburger stood out for its quality, taste, and a bit of variety for burgers and burger-a-likes.

Flash forward to 2014.  There are great burgers on every corner (well, almost). That being said, the Sin City is still a great burger, no need to go with the heavier burger, it is quite satisfying with cheese, bacon, onion haystacks, & a fried egg.

As much as everyone seems to like the Smash Fries (crispy shoestring fries tossed in olive oil with garlic, rosemary, and salt), I prefer the Sweet Potato Fries.  Classic thin fry cut, lightly battered/breaded, for crispness, & mildly sweet.

I am glad that there are great burgers out there, but this is one of the places that helped raise the bar in the first place.

Enjoy, but there are PLENTY of great burger & fry joints out there."}
{"text":"Food is good, never enough help at the lake pleasant store, always a wait, last visit, order was wrong twice, won't go back during busy time they can't handle a lunch crowd & never schedule enough help during prime time."}
{"text":"Much better this time. Fast FAST service, food was excellent. Order was correct, loved sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Smash Burger is definitely the supreme burger.
While expensive, this restaurant takes the burger to the next level!
The burgers themselves are SMASHING, along with the fries, and milkshake.
Smash Burger definitely has a fan, but can use a little less salt... but other times, that wasn't a problem."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I tried the Smashburger and it was delicious. The meat had a nice juicy taste to it  and the egg bun it came with was awesome. I also ordered the Smash fries, which weren't bad. They were seasoned with garlic and rosemary, which gives them a distinct flavor from fries you'd get at other places. I just thought the rosemary was a little over-powering so I added some pepper to \"balance\" it out.

Perhaps the best thing here are the milkshakes! I had an Oreo milkshake and it was really darn good! It was made with Haagen-Dazs ice cream, which is my favorite brand of ice cream. It was very thick and creamy and they topped it off with whipped cream.

As for the restaurant itself, it's very casual like you'd expect at a typical fast food restaurant. The main difference is that it's more expensive than similar places like Wendy's or Jack-in-the-box. My meal alone was about $10, which included the burger, fries, and fountain drink. (The milkshake was about $4-$5 extra.) Overall, a good place so I plan to go back."}
{"text":"the classic smashburger is pretty good especially with chipotle bun. the sweet potato fries are great."}
{"text":"the arizona burger gets the extra star here- it's wonderfully spicy. other than that, it seems like big specialty burgers that are good but not great"}
{"text":"The chili cheese dog and smashfries here are awesome. So delicious and fresh. I don't know why people would continue to patronize the awful chain fast food places when they have a SmashBurger in their town. Besides also serving burgers, and also being leaps and bounds above your average fast food burger joint, I wouldn't invite the comparison to In-and-Out like others here have. They are two totally different experiences."}
{"text":"Ordered the spinach salad.  It was served in a small paper bowl.  Looked like a kids salad."}
{"text":"First time there and definitely not the last!  The burgers were amazing and my son really enjoyed his hot dog.  Great amount of food for the price!  The flavors were amazing and the burgers were big.  The french fries & chili cheese fries are THE BEST.  Can't wait to go again and try the chicken."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was hesitant to try a new trendy burger place. So glad I decided to give it a go. You go in and order your food, I ordered an avocado club on a regular bun with Swiss cheese, then sit down while they make it. I also ordered a chocolate and banana milkshake, btw. So anyways after a few moments they bring out your freshly made burger, fresh fries, and ice cold hand spun milkshake. Wow. Super impressed. This burger is beyond delicious. I am a huge milkshake snob and this is one of the best milkshakes I have had. It is definitely the best from a burger joint. So anyways, come eat here. This place has a new regular. So good."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend before class and we both really enjoyed it! The service was good and we got our food fast. The burgers were delicious and filling. I got the BBQ bacon burger and thought it was tasty, but I wish it had a little bit more BBQ sauce. Also the fries were skinny and crispy which I didn't mind either! Over all the food was descent and I wouldn't mind coming back!"}
{"text":"I tried Smash for lunch today.  I got a regular SinCity and an order of Smashfries.  I washed it all down with an Iced Tea

The burger was good; a regular was enough for me.

The Smashfries had good flavor but were very oily.  I probably would skip them next time and try a side salad.  

My lunch cost me less than $11."}
{"text":"I bought a few Groupons to this place and used my first this Friday.  The line to order was about 8 deep, but it took about 10 minutes to get to the front to order.  2 registers, and only one person taking orders on a Friday night at 7? Once I gave my order I waited for my togo at a nearby bench.  I was able to watch the order times for all orders as they were entered since there was a monitor with the orders near the kitchen window.  I noticed a guy waiting for his order while I was in line, shaking his head and waiting impatiently.  I now know why he was disappointed.  It took 8:02 to assemble my order of an AZ burger and a Black Bean burger.  Really?  At this point I have spent 18 minutes from arrival to reception of my burgers.  I think most sit down restaurants can also meet this time with no problem, but this place specializes in burgers....?  

Ok, now to review the food.  Our burgers were tasty, but they didn't replace the onions for grilled ones as I requested on one burger and the other burger didn't have fried pickles that I paid extra for.  Being in a hurry I didn't have time to check or go back to fix this.  I guess the discount I planned on from my Groupon was not really a discount after all :(   On a positive note, I did like their rosemary fries.  So much that I scarfed down the last ones without offering any to my girlfriend, oops.  For what it was, it was overpriced \"slow food\".  I guess I'll go back to use my other $12 groupon, but it'll be for just that, $12 worth in rosemary fries.  I might share some this time, ha."}
{"text":"Two Words = Fresh Quality.

One of the freshest high quality burgers I have ever tasted.

1 star = Great menu. The menu has a variety of options. I thought it would be a simple menu, but I like the fact that they have more options than your average fast food burger joint. They even have 2 kinds of potatoes for their fries! Sweet! I had a bacon cheeseburger with avocado. Yum!

2 stars = Freshness. You can really taste the difference in the meat here, and it's good!

3 stars = They bring the food to you. I like that kind of service at Fast Food joints!

Lacks the 4th star because the SmashFries are super greasy! Sweet potato ones are not so greasy, and they are really filling!

Lacks the 5th star for this location because it smells really crappy outside (sewer smell) and it comes in the restaurant and ruins your whole dining experience. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Everybody has the right idea about reviews of this place. I didn't have a single complaint!

Decor: we walked into a really clean restaurant. Docor was comfortable as most other places, and they had plenty of seating indoor and out.

Customer service: Right as we walked in, we were greeted warmly, and the cashier was super friendly, attentive, and made it relaxing. Tried upselling shakes, but not in a rude way at all. Very nice staff, hands down.

Food: I had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger. The burger was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and dressed. I have zero complaints about the food. Fast, fresh, and yummy fries.

Overall: I will be coming back here for sure, still haven't found a burger spot to rival!"}
{"text":"Very greasy food and if you want to have a heart attack, check out their calorie count on their burgers. Oh yeah you will have a heart attack after eating it.  This place seems to be very popular but has mediocre food."}
{"text":"My sister from Tenn. called and let me know that Smashburger was a place worth trying. After tonight's dinner, I certainly agree. I really liked the burger, but it fell short of loving it. Matt and I each got Bacon Cheeseburgers. After ordering I noticed that the regular burger and bacon cheeseburger had several differences, not just the bacon. We had them add lettuce and tomato and smash sauce, which are standard on the regular burger.  They were really accommodating in handling the modification. I also wasn't too sure if I wanted regular fries or their special smash fries, so they made a small sample for us to try. I decided on the smash fries and Matt had the sweet potato fries. Neither of us were disappointed. The last option we had we for our drinks. We both had Chocolate milkshakes. They're made with Haagen Daiz and are deeeelicious. (I'm sure there's at least one spelling error in that last sentence.)  My only complaint is that they were too small for a $4 shake. About the size of a medium soft drink. A final recommendation to Smashburger -- lighten up on the salt on the burger. It ruined an otherwise delicious hamburger. I'll try it without the bacon next time. Maybe that's where the excess salt taste came from.  Smashburger is a new fast food restaurant for the Las Vegas area. They may still be learning how to get it right. In some ways, they are outstanding. In others....well lets just say that there's room for improvement. I'll try them again and update the review if appropriate."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, I've heard some good things about this place but my first experience and probably last experience was not what I had expected!! First off, I couldn't even finish my overpriced burger because it was making my stomach turn. The terrible shoe-stringed fries didn't help either. Oh yeah and the iced tea tasted very watered down and gross. The bathrooms were not cleaned whatsoever, there was toilet paper and paper towels all over the place, and the toilet seat top itself wasn't even on. 

Bottom line....take my advice and go to IN N OUT burger instead. Better food, happier wallet."}
{"text":"The fries were stale and cold, and the drink was diluted. Will never return again...."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit the new Smashburger and OMG it was THE BEST BURGER EVER! Okay, maybe not ever, but wow that burger was so awesome.  Cooked perfectly, very juicy and hot. YUM!  Went perfectly with the ice cold chilled mug of Bud Light!  My waistline can't afford to eat hear very often but already I can't wait to go back. Wow.  Can't say enough-loved it!"}
{"text":"Ive ordered from this restaurant TWICE and both times they've screwed up my order. Today I ordered a truffle mushroom burger prepared - and I mean LITERALLY - \"very, very, well done (no pink inside)\" and not only was it pink it was actually red. GROSS!  Unhealthy!!  See the picture AFTER Id taken a bite.  I was very specific and actually took some time with the person who took the order to make sure he knew that this was important. I don't know what else I could have done. They are 0 for 2.  An aside: noticed there were only children working up front (all under 19) I wonder about the other aspects of food preparation these kids don't take seriously. I'm done (even if the food isn't)."}
{"text":"Not too bad, not that great either.  I always get my orders to go and I always get the mushroom-swiss burger.  I've dined in at the SmashBurger next to UNLV before though.  The UNLV location is always a tad busier but service is superb.  

SmashBurger doesn't really leap in terms of a burger joint over other burger restaurant.  This location has mixed up my orders before and that's how I've had the privilege of tasting other burgers.  lol.  Other than that I always order the mushroom swiss 1/2 lb burger.  My to go paper bag always leaks of grease or \"juice\" so I like to wrap my burger in layers of napkin on the way out of SmashBurger.  By the time I get to eat my burger, the napkin absorbs so much of the excess grease.  

Their healthier option are the chicken burgers.  So it's not all bad."}
{"text":"The Baja burger was pretty good, with a nice kick.  The haystack onions were yummy, but a tad on the greasy side.  Smashfries and regular fries were limp, greasy, disgusting.  The shake was just meh.  The staff was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a coworker - only got fries but those fries were ADDICTING. I don't know what spice mix they put on there but they were amazing. After that I can't wait to try a whole burger."}
{"text":"Smash is probably my go-to when I feel like a burger but don't want a drive-thru, fast foody burger - plus it's close by.

Eat in quality is usually pretty good, take out is hit or miss. Last time my burger looked like someone sat on it a few times.

Had they kept the crispy chicken around, they'd have got another star."}
{"text":"Where I go when I want to get smashed!

There are a lot of burger joints in this town, so the competition is fierce (like Sasha).  When I have those off days I want a burger but aren't feeling In N Out or Five Guys, I often end up at Smashburger.  Gotta love those griddled burnt edges!  Smash, smash away my friends!

I'm one who likes the ease of combos on a menu, and finally Smashburger has a few \"Smash Specials\" on their roster.  For $5.99 you can have your choice of a regular:

-Classic Smash
-All American
-Mushroom Swiss
-Classic Hot Dog
-Classic Smashchicken ($6.99)

Each special comes with a small order of French fries or Smash fries (fries seasoned with olive oil, rosemary & garlic).  For another $1.89 you can add on a small drink.  I like the convenience of this as well as the price so I often get this as a meal.  I usually go for the Classic Smash (American cheese, Smash sauce, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, onion & pickle on an egg bun) or the Mushroom Swiss (Crimini mushrooms, Swiss & mayo on an egg bun).  Don't get me wrong, I love the Sin City burger just as much as the next guy, but sometimes I like my fries included with the burger, you know?

You can of course add another $1 and get your Smashburger upgraded to the 'Big' size, but honestly I think it can be a tad dry.  If I'm gonna eat a 'fat' burger, I want the middle of it to be pink & juicy!  Yes folks I said it.  And I mean it.  Their egg bun is where it's at though.  Supple, yet firm, makes their burgers tasty!

The Smash Special combo is just enough to satisfy my appetite.  You hungry eaters will most likely just order the bigger burger to begin with.  I have yet to try most of their other side or options on the menu, but they don't look half bad.  Fried pickles or haystack onions?  I'm in.  Cobb Salad?  I'd give it a whirl.  Hand-spun Haagen-Dazs milkshakes?  I think I will!

Smashing!"}
{"text":"I give it a 3 1/2 stars.  Hard to give out much more because there are so many places in Las Vegas to get a burger!  

In our town, I would guess the biggest local chain players (besides the obvious) are In-N-Out, Five Guys, and SmashBurger.  All have their merits.  And I have tried all three places at one time or another.  

For me, SmashBurger ends up being just average.  I do like them, but it's nothing overly stellar from other burger joints I frequent.  I don't go out of my way to grab a SmashBurger, it's not something I have a huge craving for.  I'm just as happy going to Subway for a Cold Cut Combo (yes, I'm a cheap Subway whore..ha ha).  Really.  

SmashBurger works just like any other order then sit-down restaurant.  Check out the big billboard menus, pick a burger, pick the size (Smash is 1/4 pound, Big Smash is 1/2 pound), add your sides and your drinks, and you're done.  Sit down and wait for your eats.  Easy-peasy as long as you know what you want.  If you don't, you can create quite the line behind you because SmashBurger doesn't usually have more than two ordering counters.  

The signature burger at SmashBurger here in Las Vegas is titillating-ly named the 'Sin City'.  Figures.  But the burger isn't that bad at all.  Burger patty, topped with a fried egg, applewood-smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions (fried onions), and their smash sauce on an egg bun.  Actually quite delicious...but only when the egg is fried right!  It MUST still be runny yolk on the inside, so it gets on your burger when you bite in and creates a nice little sauce of sorts.  Tasty.  If that fried egg has an overcooked yolk on the inside - return it for a new burger.  It totally ruins the experience with an over fried egg!  You pay $7 for your burger, make sure they get it right.

The other burger at SmashBurger I enjoy is the Avocado Club.  Burger topped with fresh avocado, applewood-smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and ranch dressing on a multi-grain bun.  Yep, sounds a bit on the healthy side for a burger, but still good to grind on.  No cheese on this one because the avocado is plenty rich.  Just be sure they include a nice amount, one time we got it and there was only two measly slices on top!  Didn't even cover half the burger surface.

One thing that irks me about some of these burger joints is that they don't include fries and a drink, nor do they have a combo meal discount when you do get these with your burger.  But instead of just fries, SmashBurger offers different sides.  So if you don't want their Smashfries (fries with rosemary, olive oil, garlic - pretty good) or their sweet potato fries, you have options.  Get a side of haystack onions with dipping sauce, veggie frites (yes- FRIED carrot sticks and green beans), or a side garden salad.  I will say though with the drinks at least they serve Coca-Cola, a plus for me.  Not to mention, they have some cheap off-brand $1 canned beers to go with your burger.  With a frosty mug, nice addition!

Because of no fries with their burgers, I sometimes opt for the kids meal.  Yep, I sure do.  Actually not a bad deal.  For $4.99 you can get a Kids SmashBurger with cheese (and any of their free toppings), a small side of fries, and a small drink.  Don't want a kids burger?  Then choose the kid-friendly chicken strips or a hot dog.

Forgot to mention, if you don't want a meat burger, you can choose a chicken breast or veggie burger instead for about the same price.  From what I hear, the veggie burgers at SmashBurger aren't bad.  

As much as I don't mind SmashBurger, it doesn't appeal to me as a real burger joint.  Hate all you want, but I feel like it's a place for burger hipsters!  Multi-grain buns?  Come on now!  When I think burger, I think diner or spoon, greasy, tasty.  It's the American way!  I can get diner from In-N-Out, and I can definitely get greasy spoon from Five Guys.  When I go to SmashBurger I feel like I should be business casual, with a kale shake in my man-purse.  It just gives me Starbucks-hipster-trendy vibes!  Good for you insurance salesmen, obsessive personal trainers, and germaphobes.  

Me?  I guess I'm a bit of a caveman when it comes to burgers."}
{"text":"The burgers here are awesome. Our kickass waitress Kenna recommended the Sin City burger. It was so good, i almost ordered a second one but smash fries i ordered it with filled me up. 
Kenna is a great waitress and should get a raise. Ill keep coming back to this location as it is really clean"}
{"text":"Very good.  Came here with my wife and daughter at lunch. There was no line so we were able to walk right up with no wait. Didn't have any issues with the service.

My wife and I shared a BBQ burger and Windy City burger. The Windy City was heavy on the brown mustard, but the BBQ was great. I tried the American Lager, not bad and my wife had a chocolate shake which was excellent.

Overall, good food, good service. Only con was the price. Our whole meal was $32. For something which is in-between fast food and a sit down family place like Red Robin, I thought the price was a little high. I was expecting around $20."}
{"text":"So. Delicious. Great food, fast and friendly service. Truly as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I had a mediocre experience at Smashburger. Unfortunately I was not really impressed at all. It wasn't bad. The burger was actually pretty tasty while the fries (non-smash) was average. I had to ask for fresh tires because the first ones they gave were lukewarm and kind of gross. The burger didn't look like how it did in the pictures....

The line to order was extremely slow. It was prime lunch time and there were a lot of people in line with only one person working the register while another stepped in for about 2 customers and then left into the kitchen. If I knew I would wait so long, I would have just called ahead or got my food delivered. The workers didn't seem to want to be there, and seemed like they had zero motivation. 

For the area, the price is average but the portion sizes don't really make up for it."}
{"text":"The hamburger was good, the fries were absolutely fantastic and the service couldn't have been better. We were in and out with over 6 full meals in 7 minutes."}
{"text":"Smashburger is good.  I prefer In 'n Out, but I can see why some people love this place.  The restaurant is typically clean, but some of the staff seem like they may use drugs."}
{"text":"Just had my first smashburger......the sin city burger!  AWESOME!!
FRESH, JUICY AND TASTEY!
cheaper than the 5 rip off guys....i'm sold !"}
{"text":"Been there once after a soccer game.  Only liked their chili cheese fries.  Everything else was  below par.  Quick service tho it was not very busy"}
{"text":"We ate dinner there on 11/17/11.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  We ordered:
Sin City Burger (egg, onion strings, grilled onions, American cheese, smash sauce, egg bun), The Buffalo Chicken sandwich (grilled), an order of the fried pickles, haystack onions & the Chili-Cheese fries. 

Hubby liked the SCB although he prefers his meat a bit rarer (pointed out that SB cooks all burgers a particular way). The Buffalo Chicken was good-maybe a tad too much of the hot sauce but the blue cheese crumbles were perfect!

LOVED the fried pickles- they were light on the outside-juicy warm pickle on the inside with a side of ranch  (ranch was fine-not awesome but it didn't taste like it came from a bottle!).  Loved the Haystack onions and sauce that came with as well.  The chili cheese fries were good.  Light on the chili but still tasty.

We signed up for their deals and already got a buy one get one entree free!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sorry In-N-Out, but I've found a new lover. Even though In-N-Out is just across the street, SmashBurger blows their burgers away! Many more choices, but they same homemade burger taste. You won't see a Wendy's square or fast food circle burger here! They are handcrafted and delicious! I had the Sin City burger, hold the onions, add avocado and a side of the Sweet Potato Smashfries. Ammmmmaaazing. Plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, friendly service and fast service. Served up like a $$$$ restaurant but with a laid back vibe. I'm kind of glad its not too close to my house or I'd have a serious addiction! Definitely the BEST burger I've had in Las Vegas. I LOVE THEM! Now if they just had a pastrami burger, I'd have to marry them."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and it's good every time. Today (Friday) I went in around noon. I knew it was going to be busy but I wanted a smashburger. Surprisingly enough I only waited maybe 5 minutes longer than usual. Many customers were getting angry with the workers. I'll happily wait an extra 5-10 more minutes for food that's made right rather than rushed and thrown together."}
{"text":"Maybe we picked a bad night but the restaurant itself was very dirty.  Food on floor, dirty tables etc.We did go in at 8pm after a long day I'm sure .  Burgers were good.  Traveling through and probably won't pick this spot again."}
{"text":"My mom loves this place however I'm not really a fan the quality isn't good to me especially for the price"}
{"text":"Smashburger is always a solid choice. I got the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Smashburger, and it was delicious! I also loved the sweet potato fries. I especially want to call out Melinda, who is a superstar employee. She has been here in previous visits as well, and we always see her as kind and hard working employee. She makes our visit special. We love this Smashburger and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I tried Smashburger quite impulsively this weekend after catching a flick at Tempe Market Place.  I found myself really hungry, and a burger sounded so good!  A friend of mine told me that this place was so-so and kinda expensive, so I went in a little skeptical - but I came out a big fan!  I ordered the American Smash cheeseburger, the regular size.  I noticed there was also a larger \"smash\" size but I'm really glad I ordered the regular size because it was huge!  I had trouble picking a side -  I was leaning toward the flash-fried asparagus and green beans but the cashier recommended the rosemary and garlic fries.  My burger came out piping hot and the fries were crisp and hot as well.  The burger had a ton of ketchup and mustard on it, it kept getting all over my hands as I ate it.  If you aren't a fan of condiment explosion on your burger, you might want to ask for them on the side.  There was also a \"smash sauce\" on the burger that I was excited about, but I think it must have melded into the flavors of the ketchup and mustard because I couldn't really discern the taste of this \"special sauce.\"  I'm a fan of interesting sauces, so next time I'll definitely say hold the ketchup and mustard so I'll just be able to taste the smash sauce.  I really wanted to try one of their milkshakes but decided not to on this visit.  They touted a Nutter Butter shake that I'd like to try someday!
Not quite sure why my friend said it was expensive, everything seemed pretty reasonably priced.  The burger was about 5 bucks (but real angus beef and quite large) and the fries were 2 bucks.   Perhaps it was expensive because she feeds a family of 5!
Smashburger is yummy and I thought it was tastier than 5 Guys and In N Out Burger!"}
{"text":"Great burger for a place like this!  Fries were just okay, but the sweet potato fries were the best I've had in awhile!

This is totally worth it if you want a good burger, but don't want a sit-down restaurant type of situation."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger. Just not this one.

We dropped in for our first visit at the Park Road location after seeing a movie at Park Terrace. 

I've been enjoying the burgers In Cotswold and Stonecrest for awhile, so I knew what I wanted -- Classic Smash, no tomato, on a gluten free bun. We walked up to the counter to a young woman looking directly at us, and while playing with her hair, she let me know that she's not taking orders right now and that we'd have to wait. Right on. 

Once we were permitted, by another employee, to make our orders, we took our number and our drink cups and were off to find a seat. The layout in the Park Road location is maze-like -- definitely not the open, airy layout of the other Charlotte locations. If anything, it's kind of dark and dreary in there, with high partitions separating the tables. 

Our meals were delivered quickly. Everything was as we'd ordered, but the temperatures were all over the place. My burger was warm, but the bun was cold. I decided to try the new Smashtots, which were great once they cooled down enough to eat; they were lava hot when they arrived at the table. Another oddity was my boyfriend's burger; he'd ordered two patties which were both comically larger than the bun they were served on. His meal looked like a flying saucer; flat and wide with the burgers and with a tiny, domed bun on top. 

While we ate, we noticed at least half a dozen employees aimlessly milling about. Two came bursting out of the back in a piggyback riding situation. 

I might order for pickup or Postmates from this location, but if I plan to sit and enjoy a burger, I imagine I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Smashburger is my favorite burger place in Charlotte. I'm not usually all about chain restaurants, but this place gets it right time and time again.

If you're gluten free like I am, you're in luck. The GF buns are delightful. They're large and soft, which is a hard combo to come by. GF buns often come out stale and crumbly elsewhere, but Smashburger has always been on point.

The milkshakes are fantastic, and if you mention you'll be sharing one they'll bring it out in two separate glasses, each with their own whipped cream and toppings. This is one of those little things that makes a big difference as it comes to service.

I've ordered Smashburger in-store, through Postmates, and called for pick-up and every time my order is perfect. I can't say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the staff will go out of the way for the customers. The wait staff will bring your orders and if you need something they insist on getting it for you. It is part of the Smash burger experience, not something they do to keep their jobs. The employees here are comrades and work together like a well oiled machine. Their food is amazing and made so well. Check this place out, this location has supreme service."}
{"text":"In a quick look over the reviews below, it looks like the biggest gripe people have is with the staff... Maybe there been some turnover, but I found the staff super friendly and efficient. The food, however... Not so great. 

To be fair, I've never been to smashburger before, so I'm not sure if it's the location or the chain, but the burger patties were SO salty. I think they both oversalted in general, and also didn't mix their ground meat well, so the salt concentrated in certain spots, and it was terrible. I also didn't like how the prices weren't shown on the menu. 

However, I liked the fact that you have an option of protein (beef, chicken, turkey, black bean) regardless of what burger you order."}
{"text":"Went to smash burger yesterday to have lunch on the patio... took my service dog in training and stood in line to order (holding him not even on the ground)  with my bf and the manager Berry approached me and asked me to leave with my dog didn't even ask if he was a service dog or anything told me I couldn't order and had to take him out immediately... thought this was pretty terrible... don't bring your service dogs here  the manager Berry makes you feel very unwelcome"}
{"text":"Disgusting!! I left with a stomach ache and empty wallet.  My boyfriend really wanted to try out Smashburger so I agreed. Boy I wish I would have stuck to my guns and said NO! Boyfriend had the mushroom swiss and said it tasted not so great. I had the Arizonian and the only thing on it that I enjoyed was the guacamole. It was the most awful tasting burger I have ever had. Unless of course you love the taste of grease because that's all the burger tasted like to me. I think their whole gimmick is to \"smash\" the flavor out of the meat and sop up all the grease flavor. 

I tried the Smashfries too and meh. They tasted like frozen shoestring fries thrown in the over. They were not appetizing.

Definitely not a fan and will likely never go back."}
{"text":"No chicken?  How can you run out of chicken when that's half your menu?  There are grocery stores close by. Go buy some chicken breasts."}
{"text":"I love smash burger! 

Definitely prefer bachi if I don't want a \"Norma\" burger.

Anyways. I have to say i hate the setup of the ordering.

Right when you enter and to the left... Is the menu. But people are in line and if you want to look people want to cut you.

I don't like their \"healthy\" options.

There are sweet potatoe French fries and then fried veggies.

They should offer veggie sticks.

I've had the grilled chicken sandwich and the sin city burger before.

I liked the chicken sandwich/burger. 

Pretty straight forward. Fresh ingredients.

Sin city burger had American cheese, fried onion straws, bacon and topped with an egg.

Also really good.

Food doesn't take long at all, everyone is mostly nice, and a meal is usually under 12 dollars.

Burger, sides, and drink are all ordered separate.

Oh yea! Fried pickles are way too salty."}
{"text":"Horrible service. After waiting 15 minutes in line, I ordered my food & sat down to wait. Before sitting down, I specify to the gentleman working the counter I wanted smash fries, opposed to regular fries. He acknowledged I said this & then yelled it to kitchen worker. I go to sit down, and they also tell me there's no bacon available for my bacon cheeseburger. I ask for a substitution or a refund of the dollar I spent on that bacon. Also requested a peice of lettuce because at this point my food had come out with regular fries. I Got neither, the young man avoided my table for the remainder of the evening & left unsatisfied and irritated. . I will NEVER eat at this mismanaged restaurant."}
{"text":"Is this chick really taking a to go order when there is a long line of people piled up waiting to order? Come on now!"}
{"text":"These are the best burgers I have ever eaten. I absolutely love this place! My regular order is the Classic Smash with cheddar instead of American and no smash sauce, with an order of SmashFries. The burgers are juicy and delicious and reliably good. 

I also love the SmashFries, but these are less reliable. Sometimes they are perfect, tossed in the olive oil and rosemary and perfect and crunchy, but sometimes they are literally swimming in a pool of olive oil and then they are not that good.

Not everyone likes a smashed burger (as you can see by the mixed reviews) and if you look online, there is heated debate about whether or not a burger should ever be smashed, but if you are one of the people who enjoys a smashed burger, go no further than this chain--you love these!"}
{"text":"Did my first smash and dash and it worked! Was easy and very fast when I was in a rush to go grab lunch today! This location is great and has exquisite food! The fries are as well as good as the burger most places you get a nice burger with soggy or too salty French fries and here they are just right"}
{"text":"Smash burger is my favorite burger place.  So happy to find this location closer to me!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Smashburger but I must say it was pretty good! I chose to dine in with some friends and the service was really quick. 

I had the Avocado club but instead of a beef patty I had a turkey patty. I think it's really neat that you can choose beef, turkey, or a chicken patty. I had that paired with the regular fries but I do regret not getting the smash fries. The smash fries are seasoned with rosemary, garlic, and olive oil. 

We had a huge party so we had our food made pretty quick which kinda shocked me. I thought we would be waiting forever for our food. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is the patty was really greasy. I had to pat some of the oil off with a napkin because the oil was dripping out of the patty. I know it's a fast food place, but I wish they could cut some of the grease. Other than that it's a great place to eat lunch/dinner at. I'd probably go back!"}
{"text":"Very flavorfull and tasty. I had a sin city burger and loved it. A little heavy for my taste but still very good. The sweet potato smashfries are good but could be less greasy. 4 stars for the taste. -1 star for the health factor."}
{"text":"The Smash Fries are awesome.  The burgers are super fresh.  When you need to let your burger cool before eating it and it's not microwaved, that's the best.  I've been here several times.  All the burgers are top notch.  I've tried Mushroom and Swiss.  The Sin City.  The Spinach and goat cheese.  The Buffalo and Blue Cheese.  I loved them all."}
{"text":"Awesome burger.  Love the Mushroom and Swiss combo.  Service was good.  They messed up my order at first, but they fixed it without a complaint.  I give the staff high ranks.  They paid attention to us even though the place was busy.  Love the Vitamin Water on the fountain - a great alternative to sodas that are too sweet.  It may sound weird, but I often choose the restaurant I eat at based on their non-soda drink choices.  What I like most about Smashburger is first coupons that they send occasionally by eMail, but second the fact that some of their burger combos are under $7.  The burgers are really juicy.  One thing I can't stand is a dry obviously frozen burger patty.  They seem to use a superior quality of meat at Smashburger.  The flavored smash fries are always awesome.  I'd put this place up against many fancy restaurant burgers that cost twice as much."}
{"text":"I just want to say \"Screw you Crapburger!  You wasted my cheat meal for the whole week!\"

I checked in this place out the other night.. It was empty.  I was hungry and wanted to treat myself to something nice, like a burger or something.
So i order and ate and it didn't go as well as i planned.

The Sin City Smashburger with the fried nonyolky egg was lousy ;however, the bacon in it was good.  Then again I hadn't had bacon in a long, long time.  I mean the patty itself was decent, but the burger as the whole was just awful. And what's with all the onion crap on it?  It doesn't help!
The Smashfries with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic was crap too.  I guess this was my fault since i wanted to be more adventurous, but had i known I'd be eating shit i would have skipped it.  Ketchup didn't help either.  I took a few bites before they went limp on me.  

Oh, and your strawberry milkshake sucks too.  Why does it taste, i dunno, malty?  The aftertaste had this bitty-sourness to it.  I don't know what it is, but of all the milkshake i ever had in my life my taste bud did not hit it off with this one.

Service was nice.  Probably because they don't get many visitors, so it's a treat for them to see an outside form of life entering their premises.  

fml this healthy living turned me miserable."}
{"text":"Just your normal Burger Joint in my opinion. One thing about this location that I like is the location.  Literally outside this restaurant is a ton of places to eat at in a one mile radius.  If you're in the mood for burgers around here, you have IN-N-Out, Five Guys, use to have Create, and this place.  

The inside of this place is always clean and all you will see is red.  Fine with me, just as long as all I see isn't blue.  When you walk into this place, it is deceivingly busy.  Long lines during lunch time, but line goes through quick.  The sfaff also brings the food to you.  A plus for me is that this place has real silverware.  I'm a dipper when I eat burgers.  So I usually cut my burgers in 3 portions so that I can dip them.  Doing this with plastic silverware is sometimes a challenge. 

Now for the food.  I haven't tried any of their angus burgers at this point.  When it comes to burgers, I like them plain (meat, cheese, bun, and that's it).  So, I can only review their Chicken Sandwiches. 

-Crispy Chicken Sandwhich w/Swiss:  Had ranch added and it's pretty good.  Reminds me of the Charleston Chicken Sandwich that Denny's use to have.

-Grilled Chicken Sandwhich w/Swiss:  Tasted a little bland

-Smash Fries:  Addicting

-Bottled Water:  $2 for a bottle of Crystal Geyser water. You can get a case of this water at Big Lots for less than $3.  

-Milk Shakes:  I've been lectured more than once because I have never tried their shakes.  Everyone I've talk to swears by them.  So if you're reading this, try their shakes!!

My rating may change after I try their angus burgers and shakes, but for now just a 4 because I left satified everytime."}
{"text":"I don't frequent SmashBurger that much.  With so many fast food burger joints out there, it really comes down to mood and convenience if I am in that burger mode. 

This SmashBurger is located in Centennial across from Canes.  My last visit at SmashBurger was a little boring since I only got a basic burger.  This time I decided to get their Sin City Burger.  The Sin City Burger is basically a beef patty, onion strings, cheese, their special sauce, and an egg.  Yes, I said an egg.  Did I get fries?  Since I'm already consuming 1300 calories, why not? My burger was greasy and all over the place.  It was filling, but 1300 calories better be filling.  Food was still good, but can't help to feel like I just wasted a couple of workouts in 15 minutes.   

You get what you expect from a fast food burger joint.  Cheap, tasty, and greasy.  Service was good and the burgers are served to you.  I guess I'm a In-N-Out Faithful, especially since their Double Double is half the calories.

TIP:  Don't forget your Yelp 10% Check In discount.  I always forget.  Maybe it's because I usually check in when I'm checking out."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever seen. Ordered online 2 hours before we were to pick up our order and that was noted in the pick up time. When we got there they had not started making the order and we showed up 2 min after our pick up time. Four customers in front of us walked out before their order was complete and one was yelling at them because her burger took 40 min and then they threw it away once it was done when they couldn't find her seat. (This is not a big location). After this their manager yelled at us for ordering 8 milkshakes, she said \"did you see what you did to my screen\" \"I now have to go get ice cream. THEIR MANAGER SAID THIS!!! Milkshakes are a common item for them and they make way more than 8 a day. We left without them. We only had 8 other burgers, they took 50 minutes past the pick up time to be completed and half of them were made incorrectly. We will not be coming back to this location.. Ever"}
{"text":"Rude, unprofessional, and terrible customer service.

We are staying at Rio for few nights and was very glad that we found a spot that was still open. We went there on Sunday around 10:20pm, ordered their buffalo burger, bbq bacon burger, and large fries. 

The buffalo burger came first, great! Then, we never received the rest. I went back to the cashier, Jazmin, and explained that so many other customers came and left and we still have not gotten our order. She apologized and talked to the kitchen staff. This was the time that totally pissed us off. 

The kitchen staff and the lady who was serving the food on the side were talking loud. We were sitting next to them. They kept saying that they gave us the food already. They REFUSED to give us the food that we paid for and waited for 20 minutes. Jazmin, even gave us the buffalo burger as a comp and delivered all of the food to us herself. Mind you, she was the cashier. 

First time at Smashburger and will never come back. All of the staff were extremely rude and professional. Fire all of them and keep Jazmin. At least Jazmin knows what customer service is about. If she was not pleasant, I would have resorted to talking to the manager or asked for a refund. 

Do not come here unless you want to pay for $10 burger and it will be served with extreme unprofessionalism."}
{"text":"Luv, love, and LOVE  this place. Went twice while staying at Caesars Palace. The burgers and milkshakes are AWESOME. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Ok, I've done take out here numerous times. And tonight, I did and I walked in on a quiet maybe slow night.  My order was done online and everything was quick and all items completed. But there's only one thing that was disappointing, my order was cold.  I live  literally 6 mins from you guys!! And I was already to enjoy every single hot off the grill burgers but weren't. 

I even got there on time for the take out pick up  estimate time.  :( I'm don't complain much but I'm sure one of your food heater majigs may have been out?  I'm not sure.. oh well, it's no biggie but it will be if it happens to me again.  Still love your burgers tho :)"}
{"text":"First time here and what a mistake. Dining room was dirty with food all over the floor. Took to long to get the order, did not seam busy. Got home with food and was given the wrong burger. Would have just eaten it but not with jalapeños on it. Went back to get the correct burger and got my money back. Place was in even chaos when I was waiting for my burger. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went to Smash for the first time yesterday cause the Mister wanted to try it out after reading about it in a magazine. So we trekked over even though I was not in the mood for another burger place.  I was pleasantly surprised...

They are located by UNLV, not far from InNOut.  I do love my burgers but was not feeling a burger that day so when we arrived and saw that they also had chicken burgers, I was in.  I got the Spicy Baja smashchicken, it had a grilled chicken breast with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun AND sweet potato smash fries.

The chicken was moist and the burger had great flavor but I would've preferred it spicier as the jalapenos had no kick for me at all, but nothing a little tapatio wont cure.
The sweet potato smash fries though were AWESOME- they are tossed in rosemary, olive oil and garlic.

The mister had he Buffalo Smashchicken, also grilled chicken breast with Frank's buffalo sauce, crumbled blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, may on a egg bun.  He really enjoyed his also.

Next time, I'm going to try the Sin City and smash fries! AND you can build your own burger too so that is always a PLUS."}
{"text":"This is a place that serves an honest upscale-ish fast food style hamburger. I wished that they had kept the spinach and goat cheese additions on the menu, but even without them the place is worth visiting for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on our way to the strip and had okay burgers. The visit wasn't very memorable- can't really remember exactly what we had. I think I had the chipotle burger and my bf had a burger with an egg on it. I just remember the fries being really greasy. Not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Loved this burger but tried it yesterday taste awful...asked worker said they
Had changed the seasoning that made this burger unique...waste of money...if it was not broke why fix it!!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect day! These guys bring a smile to my face. Came in tonight and just wanted a meal to go on my way home from work. They made both burgers and my fries quickly and they tasted great! I had them take off the onions and it was no problem. Both of the guys working were personable and very friendly! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is my second time to Smashburger. The first time I got a bacon barbecue burger, it was $7.80. Average size, average quality. I got it to go and it seemed to be a long wait, not sure on how long. I went back today and got a regular burger for $5.93. I ordered it to go and after waiting for 15 minutes, the place was not very busy, I left. They can keep it, I'm never coming back. If you want something that's better than McDonalds for less money than Smashburger and a 80% less wait time, go to Culver's."}
{"text":"this isn't fast food, but it's darn close. Far better than In n' Out, this has great burgers with enough variety that you can count more than 3 items on the menu. 

Stay away from the shakes. They sound good but are liquidy, tasteless, and too small."}
{"text":"I would give this 3.5 stars. Burger was fresh and good. It reminds me of Steak n Shake or Freddy's in the Midwest but with more flavor options."}
{"text":"I hate to complain and give low ratings to businesses, but my visit here wasn't a very good one. 

Service was on point, but the cleanliness and the food were below average in my opinion. I came here shortly after opening so I was expecting a super clean restaurant, but many of the empty tables were dirty with crumbs and food still on them. The drink station was far from clean and organized. The bottled drinks at the register were half emptied, the floor felt sticky under my table, and the guy at the register didn't look all that clean himself. He looked rather frumpy.

Ordering was easy and quick. I ordered the Avocado Bacon Club and was asked if I wanted it beef, chicken, turkey or black bean. I decided on the chicken and to have it grilled instead of crispy. I got this with everything on it. I also ordered a side order of fried pickles. My guest got the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger with the Smashfries. Our food probably only took about 7-10 minutes before it was out to us. Everything looked great, but that is as far as the \"great\" went. My biggest disappointment was the fried pickles. They were beyond too salty and they were sitting in a pile of oil..gross!! The sandwich was decent as the bread was good, lettuce was crispy, but the avocado was turning dark and the chicken piece I got in my sandwich was super thin, about the thickness of a deli lunch meat slice. Very disappointing, especially since the sandwich was small, to begin with. 

My guest's sandwich was good, nothing special about it. Said it tasted like the same kind of quality you could have gotten at McDonald's or Burger King and for half the price. Again, the side was very disappointing. The Smashfries were nice and crispy, but they lacked flavor. They had hardly any rosemary on them and I definitely couldn't taste any garlic on them. As you got to the bottom of the pile of fries, they also were sitting in a pile of oil. So sad as I have memories of other Smashburger locations being on point with their food. I probably will not come back to this location again. 

When we were finished eating, I wanted to clean up after us and throw our trash away, but I guess they have someone come around and get the dirty trays after people leave as there were no trash cans out for the customers. Kind of frustrating for me as I like to clean up when I'm done eating. 

The one guy that was working the front was very friendly. When you ordered your food, he made sure to repeat your order just to make sure he got it correct. When he brought out your food he made sure to ask if you needed anything else. He went around and picked up dirty trays, but I didn't see him wiping down any tables."}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly recommend this Smashburger location; in fact their Arizona burger with extra jalepenos is the bomb. The employees should serve as role models for some restaurants in Scottsdale; always been treated with courtesy and respect. I always feel welcome and they have a sense of humor. Professionals with class! Great burgers and fries and shakes! I'll keep coming back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly good food. There was a bit of a line last night yet the staff worked together to accommodate all of the customers quickly. We were able to use one of the cupons Smash burger sends to us. You get discounts when you sign up for the email list. My wife was able to pull the cupon up on her phone and we were able to save some coin. My family of five with three always hungry boys were able to eat for about $35.00. 
 

The hamburgers, fries, sweet potato fries and fried pickles were delicious (we shared, I didn't eats all of the servings by myself. 

Thank you to every one at Smash Burger for a great meal and a great atmosphere in the well maintained outdoor eating area."}
{"text":"Walk up and order , no servers.  Had the CYO big (half pound) smash w/ smash sweet potatoes all for $8.75.  

There is a club you can sign up for and get a bogo coupon."}
{"text":"Sweet potatoes,milk shakes,veggie burger....amazing taste :P"}
{"text":"I think their food is great. Have never been disappointed by the quality. But I do have the say, the service is somewhat lacking. I've only been here at night, when it was dead, so I didn't have much to say about that. But then I went here during their lunch rush and it was awful. Chipotle gets just as busy and I am in and out in 10 - 15 minutes flat. At Smashburger it took me 40 minutes to get my salad. 40 minutes!? Then on top of that, the lady gave me the incorrect order. I got all the way to my car and thankfully had the inkling to look before driving away. I came back and they gave me the correct order, but didn't apologize. And the woman said, \"I tried to catch you before you left. I'm glad you came back.\" Umm how hard did you try exactly? You must've whispered my name.

I won't stop going here because of that, I'll just never ever go during lunch again. I suggest you take a note from Chipotle, maybe change up how you take or give the orders, because 40 minutes for a salad is absurd."}
{"text":"First time in a Smash Burger and the meal was very good.  Had the Arizona burger and the smash fires.  The staff were friendly and the place was clean.  We will go back again."}
{"text":"I dont claim to be a burger aficionado but i do appreciate the tasty goodness of a well made quality burger from time to time. I was lucky enough to receive a bogo coupon in my local zip code magazine for SmashBurger and the night was nice so i took a cruise and headed to the spot. Upon arrival the service was nice, and the location was very clean and managed. 
I ordered a Sin City SmashBurger which as others have mentioned have the fried egg, crispy onions, and this tasty bun going on along with the smash fries. When it arrived the presentation was solid and i was all about it digging into the fries first i was into them and they have alot of flavor but they were a bit too oily for my taste but still very good. i knew my burger had potential before the first bite when i found \"cheese paper\" you know the overflow cheese that sticks to the burger wrapper that you pick off with your finger nail and eat... yes and it was good cheese. i bit into it and was taken by surprise that it was actually this good, the egg, cheese, and crunchy onion combination just worked for me. The only think i could have asked for which ill do next time is ask that they do not fry the egg to completion and serve it sunny side up with a runny yolk i think that will be the icing on the burger. The bun is yummy, and for the ones who commented that a bun needs to be toasted?? thats a personal preference as i prefer them soft thank you so im glad they didnt do this. Its not totally what im use to with a burger as the patty was very flat, kind of thin actually as im guessing thats what the smash of smash burger is but in the end it all just kind of worked. For the price i think they are right on, and with a bogo coupon you are eating well on the cheap for sure so keep a look out for those in your mailers. Bachi Burger at $10-$12 for a burger that your hungry after? no thank you, ill take a Smashburger any day of the week. 
Give me less oil on my fries, and a runny yolk egg in my burger and they would have received 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Very good. Very tasty. Everybody was very friendly. The menu looked incredible, I will be back in order to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"A new Smashburger on my side of town? Yay, I'm happy! Smashburger has some pretty high quality burgers as far as fast casual restaurants go. I was excited to finally get over there to try the place. 

First off, the space is way too small for a Smashburger. I don't know why they thought they could cram one into this teeny tiny space. I would avoid coming here during popular meal times because there would be nowhere to sit. They are severely lacking in seating space and tables. Another problem is their huge windows mean more than half of the seating is made unusable when the sun is hitting them just right. You will be blinded or roasting from the solar rays. They have pull down shades but they do a poor job of blocking out the sun. The layout of the place is funky as well, with their fountain drink machine located in this weird corner, causing big bottlenecks when customers are trying to fill their drinks. (Bonus points for having Coke Zero, though). 

The girl taking our orders was very slow and confused but I'm guessing this is just because the place recently opened. As always, I'll go back in a few weeks to see if they've ironed out some of the kinks. The kitchen was FAST, much faster than any other Smashburger I've ever been to. This sort of worried me and I expected my burger to taste crappy or my order to be incorrect -- but it wasn't!

My burger was exactly how I ordered it and it was good! It didn't look that tasty but it tasted great. I was very happy. Most of you know I'm a low carb eater so I love when a place doesn't blink twice when I ask for \"no bread or bun.\" Sometimes it's too difficult for people to understand and my burger comes out on a bun anyway. Here it was SUPER EASY. In fact, the kitchen even served my burger on two slices of lettuce so I could make them into a \"bun\" if I wished (see my photo). I LOVED THIS! THEY EARNED AN EXTRA STAR JUST FOR THIS!

Premium add-ons like bacon and avocado will cost you $1 each. I'm totally bummed that they have removed the chili from their menu. I loved adding chili to my burger. Now it's kind of boring without it."}
{"text":"I just ate lunch here a couple of hours ago and I am so upset and disappointed in my experience that I feel the need to write this review. This is one of the worst meals I've ever had and it's a clear reminder why I avoid Smashburger, and why I won't be dining here in the future.  

The first impression wasn't a good one. The restaurant smelled bad and greasy and was absolutely filthy. I'm talking straw wrappers and crumbs all over the place, leftover food sitting on the majority of the tables, and a floor that appeared it hadn't been swept nor mopped in days. I picked up a menu to decide what I wanted to eat the menu was filthy too, with a huge chocolate smear on it like somebody had dropped their milkshake on it. Not one employee noticed this and put it back for everyone to touch. My hands got sticky and it was disgusting. I did tell the cashier and he was very apologetic and went to clean it off. 

I ordered the Avocado Club Grilled Chicken sandwich and made it a combo with a drink and I upgraded to sweet potato fries. I waited an unusually long time for my food (over 15 minutes) although the restaurant wasn't busy at all. 

First issue: the Coke Zero syrup was out. I told two employees and who appeared to be the manager. They acknowledged me but never fixed the syrup. I was stuck drinking the iced tea and something was definitely not right with that, it had an unpleasant taste like something was old or wrong with the water. I wouldn't have ordered a combo if I knew I wouldn't be able to have my soda of choice. 

Second issue: My chicken sandwich, once it finally arrived, was a letdown. The grilled chicken was hot and the avocado fresh, but the bun tasted and felt stale. The worst was the bacon that was slapped on my sandwich. It was inexcusable to serve bacon like this to a customer. It was barely cooked and all fat and was NASTY. See my photos, it was inedible. What's the point of paying $14 for a lunch when you can't even eat the elements that make it a club sandwich in the first place?

Third issue were my sweet potato fries. They were OLD, COLD and GROSS. The portion size was very small, thank goodness, because these were the worst potatoes ever. They also had a garlic taste to them which makes me think the kitchen wasn't too careful and had them next to the other fries. We all know that old and cold fries are bad, but the kitchen staff just doesn't seem to care.

I am super upset about this meal and I should've asked for a refund and left, but a line started to form and I doubt anyone would've cared about my issues anyway. After lunch I read more Yelp comments and there are some similar experiences just like the one I had. Something is seriously wrong with this location, and I hope the corporate office will send someone to intervene, terminate this franchisee's agreement, or just close the place down and put it out of its misery."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to Smashburger and unfortunately it was not a great experience. Don't get me wrong, the food was still very good although I think it had sat for a while before getting to my table. The big issue was that it took 25 minutes before they delivered my cheeseburger and fries to my table. They were certainly having some sort of issue because the restaurant was not crazy busy. I think it was system or kitchen related. Others around my table had problems with their order and delays.

With this said, I definitely will return. Problems happen sometimes - I won't hold this against them."}
{"text":"Didn't start off with stellar service, cashier made a disparaging comment about another Smashburger here in Vegas. Then I had to ask for an employee to open the ladies room, not cool. At least the food was good, fast and warm. The music however, was AWFUL so we ate fast in order to get away from that.....will probably go to another location next time."}
{"text":"I loved it.  My parents wanted to take me here and I was pleasantly surprised.  Had the double triple and really enjoyed it.  I also had the tater tots, which were ok.  And snagged some of my parents' fries, which were better than the tots.  But the very best thing was the veggie fries, which were so unique, unbreaded but quick fried crispy carrots and green beans, not oily - DELICIOUS.  So fabulous that I told a girlfriend of mine, whose a vegetarian that she has to go to Smashburger- but I just found out that they no longer serve these.  The burger is good but not the best - I'd go back for the veggie fries and get a burger but if they aren't going to serve the veggie fries, I'll go elsewhere for a burger."}
{"text":"Love this menu, the service is great, and the one time they made a mistake it was taken care of right away and they went above and beyond to make up for it. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good. Definitely choose this to a square or round cut pie of meat! I had the original which was a plain good. Nothing fancy or anything. But I definitely liked the egg bun. Nice change of what most places have. 
The smash fries were pretty good...in comparison to burger king yes but nothing fantastic as far as specialty fries go. They weren't that hot. But at the same time it was nice because they weren't very greasy. I'm personally not a huge fan of thin cut fries. I like them thicker, I feel like I'm actually eating more potato than grease. Still searching for the perfect burger place...    :-("}
{"text":"I love coming here! They offer awesome deals on their app. Everyone that works here is so friendly and efficient. The food is delicious, nice sized portions and reasonably priced. Every time I come here, my food is served to me within 5 minutes! You guys are doing a great job, keep it up."}
{"text":"Located inside the Rio and opened until 3am. Great for a midnight milkshakes or snack. Service is fast and great. Staff is very kind and patient with the variety of clients coming through here. I got a milk shake and sweet potato fries which were tasty and served within 3 minutes. My fiancé got a burger which was also tasty and took about 5 minutes to make. If you're staying at the Rio like I did this is an affordable and quality burger. Many of the other food locations in here are pricier."}
{"text":"they get two stars because the cook was a nice guy and made a good burger. manager was late store didn't open on time and manager was short and talking about write ups in front of cuatomers he also gave me incorrect change and i had to ask for rest of my change. 9 26 16 10am manager on duty was not a team player or good face of business. the cook and other guy in back were very nice and both tried to be helpful cook even came out and checked to see how all was going. other patron who came at supposed open time had to go grab his own food because manager who was running front was in back on hoa cell phone...juat bad."}
{"text":"It's not the best and it's not the worst, but if you want a greasy burger, some tasty fries and a milkshake Smashburger has ya covered. I usually go for the sweet potato fries with the yummy seasoning. Sooo tasty."}
{"text":"I am a Cheeseburger lover and for quick service, Smash Burger is my favorite. Be warned the burgers are extremely greasy which I look at as a positive, but it may turn some people off.  The patties are on the thin side and are not cooked to order so they always come out medium well.  On your next visit make sure to check out the smash fries, which are their normal shoestring fries with a special seasoning blend and olive oil. They are a great departure from the norm. The service is usually pretty good which is impressive because it's a very young looking staff. I've had my order come out wrong one time out of the dozens of times I've been there which is forgivable. The facilities seem to be kept pretty clean which is a good indicator.  But while facilities and service can ruin a quick service experience they won't make the experience. The food is the main focus and Smashburger makes a delicious burger."}
{"text":"The Sin City burger was simply amazing! And thanks to Carlos I signed up for a free milk shake for my birthday:)"}
{"text":"When it comes to a grabbing a burger, good value for your $ comes to mind here.  By that I mean being near the combo prices of the large chain burger joints with drive-thrus (Carl's Jr, McDonalds, etc), Smashburger's taste blows them away.  Also, when it comes to probably the closest resemblance of a competitor in my opinion - Five Guys, they also blow them away when it comes to value and taste compared to your dollars spent.

Numerous reviews describe the menu choices, so I will skip that except the mention of the fried pickles - this is something you don't see at most burger places and my daughter loves these!  You can also opt to replace your fries in a combo for these (I think for a price difference).

The burgers have that home made appeal and flavor with fresh ingredients and the way the edges are crispy really make things pop.  If you want to make yourself feel really guilty, get one of their shakes that are fantastic and have that old malt shop feeling about them.

Service is not the most speedy but all-in-all a place you should try and should add in to your burger choice rotation for sure."}
{"text":"Burger was very dry. No seasoning. Onions were Burt to a crisp. Frozen fries.  It was a cool building in a great spot."}
{"text":"A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  

I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.

When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've only had one burger here so far, but it was so salty that I doubt I could bring myself to go there again.

The \"smash\" portion of the burger appears to be a seasoning mix that is seared into one side of the patty.  I nice concept, but in reality the flavoring is way too overpowering.

I could see others liking it if salt was their thing, but my two cents is that this is just plain gross."}
{"text":"The line (if there is one) always goes quickly, the food is always fresh, hot, and delicious, and the service is always good.

I dont know if theres much more I can say. 2 thumbs up. The perfect meal before going to a movie (it fills me up and im forced to not buy candy)."}
{"text":"I give this place two years tops and they will be gone.  Nothing special about this place it's over priced and will not last long SmashBurger is crushed by even a place like del taco I kid you not. I had a burger at Del taco the day before and it was better then this"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good burger and the customer service is great, but they did mess up my last order! Also, I asked for a fried egg on my burger and the egg was a tad over cooked! I like my yolk just a tad runny and my egg was cooked firm. The fries are awesome though!"}
{"text":"It's super sad that the food is really good but the service is terrible. Both myself and my significant other work in food and we've come here a few times only to be very uncomfortable with the service. The cashiers are incredibly rude and unhelpful. We had to wait for her to finish texting before she could take our order on a busy Saturday afternoon. The line was out the door and food was stacked up on the counter, but there was no one in sight to take orders at the counter OR serve food. When someone would come up to take orders, they would walk very slow and the whole vibe made us feel anxious and uncomfortable. There were only 4 people working on a Saturday afternoon but none of them seemed to care about falling behind or being busy. I'm not sure why they treat their customers this way. People are always visibly disappointed with the quality of service- even though interactions with cashiers and servers happen for a brief time."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing but this place is really slow. Went in on a weekend afternoon, not busy. Still waited 15+ for our burgers. This location is also super dirty! As we sat waiting for food we had the chance to kinda look around. The ledges in the corners were filled with gross dust, the lamps were filthy, and the windows hadn't been cleaned in at least a week. It was a big turn off to be in a dirty restaurant- makes you think about what the standards are in the back area..."}
{"text":"Worst service ever they have better people at the phx location on 24th st and baseline.. I order online for what should have been a convenient pick up but NO. I went to the pick up area and waited 7 mins no one even acknowledged me and the girl was just standing at the food window. One guy who if he was a manager he should be fired. Looked back at me several times and kept helping new ppl coming in the store instead of telling them to wait so the actual next person in line could get help. Why have a pickup area if your going ignore customers. I left and went to jack n the box a lot faster friendly and cheaper! Hope hey get new management."}
{"text":"I was recently a part of a special tasting event and pounced on the opportunity to try 8 of their burgers paired with Four Peaks beers!  While I heartily enjoyed all 8 of the burgers (and their beery companions), I was especially surprised at how tasty the black bean burgers were.  My four favorite pairings were: mushroom and swiss burger with 8th Street, BBQ Bacon & Cheddar burger with Kilt Lifter, cucumber & goat cheese Chicken sandwich with Sunbru, and the Arizona Burger with Hop Knot.  Upon further exploration of multiple area Smashburgers, I can safely say that my happiness of being able to go to a fast food joint and get quality burgers with quality drinks is finally founded.  All of the staff I've encountered have been friendly and knowledgeable, and eager to serve, the restaurants have been clean and inviting, and the food has consistently been satisfying and delicious.  I really love that they provide so many options for burgers (beef, chicken, black bean), buns (egg, spicy chipotle, multigrain, lettuce), and plenty of sauces and toppings so you can truly enjoy your own creation.

What Smashburger is doing all across the country - partnering with local breweries/businesses to create an interesting and exciting local experience while retaining their national appeal - is what I have been hoping that Jimmy John's or Chipotle would do.  I guess this just proves that beer goes better with burgers!"}
{"text":"Smashburger was really good a couple years ago.

The meat is too thin now, too greasy, overcooked and over-seasoned. It still tastes good.

The prices are a bit too high for what you get."}
{"text":"In a town full of burger joints, you have to offer a good product to stay competitive. I think these guys still do.

Smashburger is a chain offering casual burgers that are a step above fast food. I had a rocky first impression (see my original review for the one on Maryland near UNLV), but I've enjoyed palatable if not downright delicious food since then. To celebrate what they boast as \"voted best burger in over 20 U.S. cities,\" they recently sent a buy-one-get-one entree free coupon to members of their mailing list. Today, I made my second visit here (not sure why I didn't review it before) to take advantage of the offer.

I forewent the chicken sandwiches and simply ordered two burgers. The Sin City Burger ($7.59 for the big size) has fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions, Smash Sauce on an egg bun. The Truffle Mushroom Swiss (same price for a big size) has truffle oil, sauteed crimini mushrooms, aged Swiss, and mayo on the same bun.

The egg bun was soft and fluffy on both burgers. The meat wasn't ground too finely, but suffers from a lack of seasoning. I think their concept is that the sides have the salt to balance it out, but you gotta have some salt in those patties in case somebody skips the sides. Funny thing is this is the polar opposite of my first visit, where everything tasted like salt had been spilled over it. Anyway, the toppings on the respective burgers all seemed good, but I preferred the Sin City because it had some sweetness from the sauce and the grilled onions.

I also ordered a side of Haystack Onions ($2.29). Think of these as the shoestring version of onion rings. They're really thin but still crispy and fatty (in the way that makes you happy). I wish the \"Texas Petal Sauce\" was a bit sweeter and a lot less zesty. Mixing in some ketchup couldn't balance it out. I also tried my friend's Buffalo Fries, which had a dusting of seasoning that does remind you of Buffalo wings. I'd personally go for the Smash Fries next time, which is my usual preferred blend of crispy and fluffy fries with seasoning.

It can be hard for burger chains to stand out, but aside from the BOGO offer that I used today, I think Smashburger does carve out their own niche. I may not prioritize it as much as other burger chains because it's not that close to home or not quite as outstanding as ones that are a marginally longer drive, but I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"First time at Smash and I thought the burger was great! Had the mushroom/Swiss burger W/ the smash fries. Burger was cooked perfect! Slightly pink in the middle and the Char flavor was great! Mushrooms done well and cheese nicely melted. The fries between regular and shoestring were very crispy and seasoned well. All in all a great burger experience. Price slightly higher but, for the quality worth the extra! A go to burger joint."}
{"text":"Man, I really wanted to like this place, considering i'm a vegetarian and I have heard wonderful things. I ordered the veggie burger with avocado, grilled onions, spicy jack cheese, etc... and it was so bland. The veggie burger was just compressed black beans, and they lacked the flavor I was expecting from an establishment of this caliber. They get 3 stars because their staff was very nice, the restaurant was really clean, and the food came out hot and fast. I might give them another try in the future, but not anytime soon as it was just ok."}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty mediocre and prices are about what you would expect in a hotel. They are open late, which is probably why they survive. The staff are friendly, and it doesn't take very long but they are not a place I would make a point to visit."}
{"text":"OK, I guess I can upgrade my rating.

I had a gift certificate for a free 1/3 pound burger burning a hole in my wallet, and I finally found myself near a Smashburger without having lunch elsewhere first. I was wary because it was one of my much maligned one-star locations, but I figured I'd order a different burger this time at least. Just as soon as one of the employees finally steps up to the register to take the order...

I had to wait with nobody in the ordering line ahead of me. Maybe two minutes, which wasn't terrible, but it reminded me of the bad service last time. The Mushroom Swiss burger ended up being the most captivating option. It had truffle oil, mayo, mushroom, swiss cheese, and the burger on whatever an egg bun is. I found it to be quite tasty and not too salty at all.

Congrats, UNLV location of Smashburger, you have regained a couple of stars. Maybe I will patronize your business establishment in the future. Having said that, I wouldn't really drive out here (or to the one on Eastern) when I have a fast food burger craving since I'll just fulfill it with In-N-Out or some sort of coupon instead. We shall see."}
{"text":"Unwelcoming employees and dirty location. The guy is taking my order and just walks away to help someone else...and never comes back. The girl then walks up and literally shoved the receipt in my hand without even making eye contact. Every single table is dirty and the floor is covered in food. I had to ask her for a towel to wipe at least one table down so we could eat. There's maybe 3 customers in here and every time there's no one to ring up the cashier hops on her phone. I know people have bad days but this location was not on their shit today."}
{"text":"My 10 year old ordered the chicken - after taking a bite and saying it tasted funny - I looked to see raw chicken - took back & complained - gave us a second order which ALSO came out partially raw!  They didn't even check the 2nd batch.  after a lame excuse and a manager that had no clue what to do we left -  DO NOT order chicken.  Hoping my son doesn't get sick tonight!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is one of my favorite burger joints.  They are a little more expensive than your regular hamburgers but I think it's worth it.  Their burgers are always consistent and very juicy. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.  Their employees are very friendly and courteous and helpful.  Their fries are pretty good and they have really good milkshakes.  This location was very clean with a nice big menu screen to order your food.  I always know I'm going to get a good meal at Smashburger..."}
{"text":"Why  not another star?....tooo much oil!. Fries come dripping oil! No objection to the fact they have herb Seasoning. 
The rest, it is just another burger served in a fancy way. All tastes good, but I certainly won't be a client. 

Service is really nice, and the place is clean and at least you can enjoy your meal, eating with no rush, like it usually happens in the red/orange/yellow colored places."}
{"text":"Greasy and overpriced. Hard pass. I've given them a second and third chance, they have disappointed every single time. Poor quality thrown together product, bad! Fries and burger shouldn't be that hard to create but they manage to do a hell of a job doing so. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Normally I like this place, but finding a hair on the avocado black bean is not desired.
Received another burger, but with same avocado and hair. I'm so upset!
Spoke to manager and he said it was a different burger. The funny part is, I made a mark on the avocado to make sure I wouldn't receive the same burger. Well, I was given the same exact burger. 
I will never eat here again. They are disgusting."}
{"text":"Food is great staff isn't. Ajuan has an attitude problem and should pay attention when a customer is at the cash wrap. The booths were dirty and he had an attitude about wiping it down. Maybe their should be more staff on around the lunch rush."}
{"text":"It's no secret that I love me a good cheeseburger  so I was excited to try a new place. New to me anyway :)

My first impression of the place is they could use a hand. It was kinda busy (Friday lunchtime) but there were only two people in front of me in line and it still took forever. Partly because when I finally got up to front the one guy taking orders had to stop to make shakes. Another guy finally came out after a few minutes and took my order. So they're not the fastest place in town.

But, I was happy to see their menu featured a \"build your own\" option. I like my burger relatively plain so I ordered the regular bun, american cheese, tomato, lettuce and mayo. I also ordered a side of the smashfries. Who could turn down fries with olive oil and rosemary? Not this girl.

The burger was juicy and tasted fresh but was a bit on the salty side. The boyfriend and friend both said theirs were not too salty so it was just mine I guess. It happens.  The fries were tasty, thin cut and came out nice and hot. Reminded me a little of McDonald's fries but with oil and rosemary. The boyfriend had the onion strings which were also a little on the salty side. Maybe the cook that day just really likes salt?

If it weren't for the over-saltiness of my burger I would have thought it was quite tasty so I'm willing to try Smashburger again. And the manager walked by several times asking how our food was. I probably should have said something but it wasn't bad enough that I didn't eat it so I can't be too hard on them."}
{"text":"clearly not as good a burger as many.  Too many better places to list.  Don't even consider if you like jalapenos.  Bacon burger so-so."}
{"text":"I tried Smashburger for the first time today. I really wanted a turkey burger, but that isn't an option here. So, I decided to try the Avocado Ranch Black Bean Burger. I am totally satisfied. A nice size burger with plenty of avocado. It was delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place! The staff is always helpful and friendly. The manger makes a point of saying hello and always thanks us for coming in.

 Sin city burger is the best!"}
{"text":"Smashburger! You know what your getting when you come here! Amazing burgers and good service. 

The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is when I arrived to pick up the order I placed online I stood in front of the pick up register and was not acknowledged for almost 5 minutes. I found this to be disappointing.  I understand others orders are being worked on but a simple head gestures, or \"We will be right with you\" would have gone a long way especially when there wasn't a line in front of me. 

Eventually I was greeted by Leah who was fantastic.  She hit all of her service points and I was on my way out the door on time with the requested pick up time.  

I will be back for sure. Food was fantastic... nothing new there."}
{"text":"This Smashburger does it well.  They have friendly employees and the establishment is kept clean.

I was helped by a gentleman named Corey who was great.  The food came out hot and tasted amazing! 

The only thing I found to be disappointing is that if you start to place your order before putting in your phone number for Smashpoints you will not receive credit, even if you haven't paid yet.  Glad I know now.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm going to be that old guy who complains about not getting enough food. The one that thinks when something costs too much money that you had better at least be full afterwards. I wish the burger was bigger... old guy. I wish there were more tots in my order... old guy again. I wish that kids respected their elders, internet was cheaper, and.... well you get the picture.

Yes the meat was good and so was the bun, but being pretty good but pretty expensive just isn't enough to get me to keep coming back. 

I give it a meh and a half."}
{"text":"Been here a few times-a couple times the food was not cooked correctly and I simply asked to have it redone.  Not only did they do it over..they gave me free stuff (shake and a coupon).  Mostly they are spot on and when they are not (there only human) they make it right.  What more do you want?"}
{"text":"The Good:  I don't think that there are such thing as a bad burger, you know like a pizza.  I love 5 guys burger and fries and the famous In-N-Out, so I was already to write this place off.  Their sign looks like a GameStop, no sure if they are going for the geek crowd.  They have a few speciality burgers or you can design your own.  I went with the Sin City Burger, Fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun, but being from California I added avocado.  I also order a side of their smashfries, tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  So good, the egg bun is soft and the flavor of the meat has some special seasonings.  Overall, a great burger, but I hope I can get the Sin City burger at the other locations too.

The Bad:  Why has it taken me so long to try this.  I thought they were only in Las Vegas but I just found out they are in San Diego also, when with they be in the OC?

The Ben:  The guy at the counter asked if this was my first time here.  I said \"why yes it is\", then he gave me the total.  I asked \"do I got something for my first time here\" he said \"nope, I just have to ask that\".  This place is now added to my must eat list when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Bomb food. 
Expect them to get your order wrong. 
If your at the right location, they'll make it right immediately. 
But all that is trumped by bomb food."}
{"text":"I have heard my co-workers talking about Smashburger for some time now, and so both my husband and I thought we'd give it a try on Saturday around lunch time.
When we walked in the line was just about to the door, and the dining room was full. The tables were filling up as fast as they were being vacated. Because it was our first time in, we didn't mind the long line as it gave us time to study the menu. 
Both my husband and I decided on the Twin Cities Burger. We decided to get the combo meal, as it came with fries and a drink. We found a table outside on the patio, and sat down. While looking for a table I noticed how ALL the tables were dirty. Good thing I carry Clorox wipes in my purse, as I cleaned and sanitized our table before our food was brought out. 
Our burgers were brought out in a reasonable amount of time. After I took my first bite, I noticed that my bun was wrong. The Twin Cities Burger was supposed to be on an onion bun, and mine was a regular bun. No worries, I ate it anyways, why make a huge deal over a bun?
The burger was cooked perfectly, the burger was topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, some kind of sauce, and mayo. The fries were crispy, but a tad salty. 
My husband tried some of the onion haystacks as his side. They were okay, but WAY to greasy.
The customer service was good, but the cleanliness is seriously lacking.
I felt the place was way overpriced for what it is, and the parking is atrocious. Smashburger is located on a corner of a very busy intersection and shares a space with Starbucks. 
If I decide to go to a Smashburger again it will more than likely be a different location."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin, I ordered a smash burger with grilled onions, red onion, pickles, guacamole, cheese and smash sauce. I have never had a burger that was served to me HOT. I mean steaming, tongue burning hot. I also ordered the salted  caramel shake. One word: SINFUL!  Hubby and I split an order of smash fries and they too were delicious. 

I love cheeseburgers. They at  a staple for me. Hate Steak-n-Shake, Really like Freddy's, and In-n-Out. But at this point, Smash Burger hits it out of the park. Now let's just see if they can remain consistent."}
{"text":"Finally getting to see what all the hype is about. These smash fries are addictive. The BBQ,Bacon and Cheddar Burger is sooo good. I will be back"}
{"text":"I had the avocado club regular burger with sweet potato fries and a vanilla shake. The burger needed some seasoning, fries were good and the shake was watery. Burger King shakes are much better. For the price, I'd rather go pick up a burger at Blue 32."}
{"text":"It's a great place for a burger. The meat is very good quality and the hamburger comes very well cooked and juicy. The ingredients are fresh and you have a lot of choices with the burgers and with chicken.

I had the avocado and bacon burger and it was fantastic. The smash fries are wonderful with the rosemary and olive oil.

Highly recommended if you're in the mood for a great burger or chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. Another new burger experience at Smashburger. I arrived b4 noon and there was a line 10 deep. I went with the bacon cheese burger regular smash and tried the smash fries which are rosemary garlic flavored with olive oil. 

I must say the burger meat was quality with little to no fat and was thick unlike In & Out. The apple wood smoked bacon was yummy and overall exceptional. The fries were thin cut and also a nice change from just boring fries. 

Con is the price isn't cheap and it's a fast food joint. Although I would return again and I'm looking forward to trying a Haagan Dazs shake!"}
{"text":"Yay!!! My 1st 5 star rating...I was going to give it 4 stars but what am I in denial? I really really like this place. I loved it in Utah and I love it here in Vegas...As I said before I am not a  hamburger type of girl but these burgers just do it for me (I know, get a room...) Seriously though I think everything here is tasty and that is the key word for me: TASTY!!! There wasn't or should I say hasn't been anything that I have tried here that I did not like. I love love love the flash fried veggies and so far the Barbecue burger is my favorite (and most fattening I'm sure) But you know what when I'm in the mood for a burger it better be lick your fingers greasy...If your on a diet should you eat here? Maybe not but if you are on diet you should maybe stay away from cheeseburgers for a while anyway, right? 
Well, there was one thing: I asked if my veggies could be all carrots(LOVE CARROTS) but the cashier said due to inventory that wasn't possible...I took it like a man and proceeded to order!!!"}
{"text":"I love Smash Burger!!!!
When I heard that for a limited time they have grilled cheese I had to get my butt over there and try it out. This location is right near my work and seems smaller than the other Smash Burgers but still looks like your standard Smash Burger. 
So there it was on a sign near the cashier \"Grilled Cheese\"
I ordered the grilled cheese that had spinach and mushrooms in it
 (I asked to have grilled onions added also) . Now, right away I knew it looked too oily/buttery. But I started to eat one half and it was still acceptable- it was good but just too darn buttery. When I picked up the other half butter was oozing out of the bread dripping down my arm. I instantly felt like if I continued to eat this it would be my last meal on earth as I would die from a clogged artery or heart attack. 
I returned it and the server gladly without hesitating had my grilled cheese remade correctly. 
They should add grilled cheese to their regular menu normally and I'm not talking about their kid's menu cause grown-ups enjoy grilled cheese also!!!!
So I would recommend having them go easy on the butter and going hard on the love....Awww.....
I love Smash Burger!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Smash Burger no matter what location it is!!!  This location is more spacious than the one on Lake Mead. I have tried other items here that I have not tried before like the crispy chicken sandwich=Good and the Chocolate Milkshake=Not so good. The Chocolate Milkshake at In-N-Out is far more superior....Anyhow, for me the burgers win hands down and I just can't get over those veggie fries-Yum!!!  I'm glad Smashburgers are popping up all over the place. I just wish one would open up in my area-Silverado Ranch or maybe even Henderson!!!!"}
{"text":"Bad reputation; First visit was up held and understood. My server was nice and well spoken. Mushroom and Swiss for a lunch special seemed to be a great choice for a \"intro bite\""}
{"text":"Won't be back to this location.  Food was not nearly as good at the Happy Valley and I-17 location, employees were aimlessly walking around and the place was FILTHY.  The tables were dirty, the floors were littered with food and trash particles...no one was at the register when we arrived and we waited about 5 minutes for someone.
Poorly managed restaurant and eating there worried me!"}
{"text":"Contrary to what my peers at work think, this is a great little place to enjoy a good meal. 
Order the handmade shake."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this location ever since they opened.  Today my coworker ordered online for pickup.  My order was supposed to be the goat cheese and spinach burger with no onions and substitute for an egg bun.  What I received was the goat cheese spinach burger on the multi-grain bun with no onions and NO goat cheese.  And on my birthday no less.  Will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Awww, Smashburger, where do I start?  I really want to love you but I just don't.  You are ok, but just not so special in my book.

I have been going on and off to Smashburger for a couple of years because my sister is in love with SB.  The burgers are ok and will get the job done, but that is about it.  They do have several speciality burgers, with the Sin City burger being the highlight of the menu.  They have recently added a new Truffle Mushroom burger to the menu.  I tried it the last time I was there and I was so disappointed by the burger.  It was smothered in truffle oil which completely overwhelmed the whole burger, as well as made it super oily.  Oh well, I guess I will just stick with the Sin City burger from here on out.

I don't know if this is true for you or not, but the fries are super important to any burger experience in my book.  The fries here are so-so at best.  Fries are super skinny and almost always extremely greasy, in a bad way.   They just don't have much fry flavor for me, but rather just frying oil.  Yuck.

The side item that saves Smashburger for me are the Haystack Onions.  These qualify for the status of statuses know as \"Oh My Goodness FANTASTIC!\"  I could eat 3 baskets full of them I think.  They are crunchy, flavorful, and finger lickin' good.  Yummy!

Overall, Smashburger is ok when you want something nicer than the drive-thru place, but not my go to place by any means."}
{"text":"\"Deer in the headlights\" Worse experience ever and I love Smash Burger. 

The utensils were not well stocked, it took 15 mins to get an order of Brussels sprouts and a cob salad

It wasn't even that busy. When I took my to go order home they forgot my ranch dressing

While sitting there waiting for my food the front staff and the kitchen staff looked very disorganized and disjointed 

Lastly, the orders that were coming out for the fee customers there were either wrong or folks were missing their food completely 

I would recommend smash burger but not this location 

Never again! This franchisee should review who he has working for him or her . yikes !"}
{"text":"The Mushroom & Swiss Burger was good, the Smash fries were decent, and the Oreo shake was really tasty. The service was friendly. There were annoyingly a lot of flies. I would return."}
{"text":"This my first review here, I've been here a few times, the first was awesome, each consecutive time seems to get worse!! All the ingredients although fresh, really need someone to watch the preparation of them, everything is so frigging SALTY!! If salt is your thing, than this is the place for you, with all the great ingredients here, I just don't know why they let those show through? This could be a better place but until someone steps in and fixes this salty mess, I probably won't be back!!"}
{"text":"I love going to smashburger best chicken love"}
{"text":"Basically an overpriced fast food place.  $21 for two burgers, fries and drinks.  Fries were cold and hard.  Go to Fuddruckers and get really good burgers for the same money"}
{"text":"I come to this location frequently because it is in a great location for other food options as well. Great fresh fries. I  had an experience where I tried to order online and it wouldn't show that it processed on the site so I went to the location anyways to see if it did go through.  I showed the cashier what was going on and because of the website error she apologized and gave me my fries for free due to the inconvenience. Great customer service. Very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ate there twice and I wasn't impressed.  My wife ordered the Blackbean burger and it was dry and tasteless!  I got the Mushroom Swiss and I'd rate it as \"ok\"; I was expecting more...for the price."}
{"text":"Smashburger makes a good burger. I've only been a couple of times but I can't recall ever being disappointed. Soft egg buns. Fresh hand formed beef patties. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

I like to order their truffel mushroom burger because it has MUSHROOMS! I love mushrooms on a burger from just about anywhere. The one at Smashburger is no exception. It is loaded with them. They are buttery and garlicy. Whats not to love? Order it with sweet potato smash fries and you are in for a decadent fast food treat.

I may not come in to Smashburger very often but when I do I get a good lunch and good service."}
{"text":"I love SmashBurger!  I really do!  I was craving a juicy and delicious burger...There was no question where we were going.  We just happened to be on this side of town and stopped into this location.  I really liked it.  They have a great outdoor seating area.  The inside seems a little smaller than the UNLV location.  Staff was very friendly and service was quick.  

If we're on this side of town and in the mood for a burger, I'm sure we'd stop in here again."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE This Place!  I went there for lunch with my dad and his friend who was in town.  We were all hooked!  My dad's friend decided to order the Sin City burger, Loved it!  My dad ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger, Loved it!  And I ordered the Southwest Burger with Avocado, Loved it!!!!  
I talked my husband into trying it....He ordered the Sin City and I had the BBQ Bacon Burger....He's been hooked ever since!  This last time we went we both had the BBQ Bacon Burger...Eat this burger if you want all of your dreams to come true!  LOL!  My dad, husband and I all talk about how awesome the burgers are all the time!  I prefer it way over In and Out.  
SmashFries are tasty...not greasy at all.  I like the rosemary addition.  My parents went before I was introduced to SmashBurger and said the sweet potato fries are good....but not great.  I've seen the shakes but haven't tried them yet.  They look pretty awesome.  Good price and fast service.  
I can promise you....We will be back!  Just writing this review makes my mouth water for a BBQ Bacon SmashBurger!  LOL!  Go try one!"}
{"text":"I've been in a couple times since this place opened in Laveen.  Overall, the place is clean, service is quick, and the employees are nice and attentive.  I mistakenly ordered a burger that didn't come with lettuce and tomato but an employee kindly brought me some.

Only a 3 here because I don't think their burgers are all that good (compared to other comparable burger joints like Five Guys and In and Out).  I do love the french fries and shakes though!"}
{"text":"Ya I'm a fan. Ever since I met the founder and he showed us how to Smash Smashburgers and explained the company phylosphy behind it all I've been hooked. I don't go for a burger very often, but when I do I try to find one of these places. They got a great menu selection and always have some cool \"Off the Menu\" stuff if you know what to ask for ;) Plus in Vegas you can get an Ice Cold Beer (Fat Tire is my choice) to wash your Tasty Burger down! Had a mix up on my order a month ago and the manager at the Sahara location sent me 2 coupons for free burgers so this one was even on the house! Thanks awesome Smashburger people!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! The portobello mushroom smash burger with truffle mayonnaise was sooooooooo good and the smash fries with the rosemary and garlic are a perfect match!!!!!! The fact that they have local craft beers to match up with what your ordering instead if the same old boring stuff is a nice change and the staff was super nice which means I will definitely be going back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is always a good place to take the kids for burgers. They get the kids burger with fries and a drink, I get the grilled chicken with avocado, lettuce and chipotle bun, I ask for a side of the hot buffalo sauce , spicy and delish! I also got the Sin City chicken once, fried egg and haystack onions on top of grilled chicken, it was a nice change. Hubs usually gets the Harvest Chicken salad or a burger ( or usually both) , both are very tasty he says. 
Service has always been speedy, friendly and accommodating. The place is clean and well stocked. 
I might take the kids there tonight now that I'm thinking about it..."}
{"text":"I went here on the advice of my co-workers. They raved about how great the food was and how it was reasonably priced. This location is fairly new and close to our workplace so we decided to try it out for lunch. 

Upon walking in the decor is fairly close to every Chipotle I've been to across the U.S. They have typical wooden tables, with semi-modern decor. Lots of Ikea like furnishings with semi-gloss metal accents on the walls and counters.

The menu is fairly limited. You order with a cashier. The price was over $9 for a bacon cheeseburger and a medium drink.

You don't receive a choice of how your burger will be done. I assume everything is made well done. The patty is fairly thick - but for the most part dry. The bun looked pretty decent. However, upon biting into the burger, I literally could not bite through the 3 or 4 pieces of bacon strewn across the meat. I can only compare the appearance and texture to (quite literally) \"Beggin' Strips\" dog treats. Unfortunately, I don't have a bite force of 325 pounds per square inch like a Tibetan Mastiff. Therefore, I just discarded the majority of the bacon and ate the cheeseburger. I can only assume this was a bad batch of bacon, since I haven't heard this complaint from others who've eaten there before. However, it really makes me hesitate about going back.

Nevertheless, despite the bacon, I can't say it was bad. It was not great. I'd probably go back if there was nothing else around. However, if there was even a Burger King across the street, my wallet and taste buds would have been much more satisfied."}
{"text":"Not happy..this burger I ordered was a sloppy mess with nasty goops of cheese on it and leaking everywhere..on top of that it was way too salty..if that wasn't enough the fried pickles weren't crispy and they were salty as well..asked for BBQ sauce for my daughters chix strips and that wasn't in there and also an order of fries was missing..plus as we were waiting for a food..mind you it's a Sunday night and this place was dead the girl took the order of the man behind us and then after he paid she said \"woo..finally made it through that line..\" lol if these little kids think that is busy I can't imagine when it's not..they need to get people in there who care and don't want to just stand around and talk to each other.."}
{"text":"I've always been attracted to the name \"Smash Burger\" because of its similarity to the game \"Smash Brothers.\" I mused whether or not some deeper correlation was going on. Perhaps Smash Burger would be as delightful as playing Smash Brothers.

Well after about 4 years I finally resolved to verify the validity of my thesis. I've concluded that although a direct correlation cannot be established, Smash Burger is indeed delightful!

I ordered a \"make your own\" hamburger with chipotle bread. Instead of fries, I ordered veggie frites: asparagus and carrot sauteed in some sort of oil, then lightly sweetened with salt (sea?). The veggie frites did it for me. It was so delicious I made sure to buy extra on my next visit.

Good food. Customer service was excellent. The restaurant was clean. Smash Burger has a new fan."}
{"text":"The best smash burger experience I've had in Vegas.  I had the BBQ bacon burger and it was put together well. I paired it with the spicy fries and there was a taste fiesta in my mouth. Muy Bueno."}
{"text":"Overpriced and just ok..  Service wasn't anything fantastic.  Grind Burger up the street is better, cheaper, and cool ambiance."}
{"text":"A great way to spend over $10, and not be full. I'm not a person with an immense appetite. The \"big\" upgrade creates a negligible difference. The namesake \"smash\" technique lends itself to a thin, dry, overseasoned burger. Fries have been consistently bland, even compared to the fries of other establishments. Customer service is good. I feel bad that the employees have to deal with this lackluster, corporate product. All aesthetic and no substance. Do yourself a favor and go to In-N-Out, across the street."}
{"text":"The burgers are FANTASTIC. The staff could be a bit more pleasant, but the food is so yummy that I'm willing to overlook their indifference. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I absolutely love this place! They serve fresh tender burgers with all the fixings you could want plus tasty fries, all for a great price. 

What's great about this burger joint is that they are licensed to serve alcohol. What's even better is that you can get a burger, fries and a beer all for under $10... you can't go wrong with that.

I also like the build your own burger menu, which makes it easy for peeps like me that are picky eaters. I love the fact that this place is neat, clean and 99% friendly with the exception of one time. I asked a question and was served a [bad] attitude by the female mngr on duty, but no biggie, everyone is allowed a crap day. I absolutely cheer this place on for all the tasty dealings their doing! Hooray!"}
{"text":"Greasy food, meager side portions & freezing - over air conditioned environment.  

And to top it all off: rude employees.
\"You're lucky that we let you eat our food\" type of attitude.

No thanks.

There are just TOO many other burger places to choose from. 

Delux anyone?? Yum!"}
{"text":"Omg! This was the best smash burger location! My food delicious and prepared quickly. Service was great! I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"\"Gourmet\" or at least independent and regional burger chains are the new big thing and get both the old junk food burger clientele who are sick and tired of the same old garbage and the new anti-junk food clientele who appreciate non-corporate, less factory food burgers.  I'm not entirely sure how much less factory these guys are.

Their burger is nothing to Yelp about.  Haha.  That will replace \"write home about\" pretty soon.  I liked their aoili sauce.  The only reason they get four stars is that they allow you drink beer at the store and it's only $3 for domestics which is approximately 150% cheaper than a casino.  They ran out of regular fries.  The line was long and it took a while, but seriously, if you want a better burger, you really do have to wait for it.  They give you a number and bring your food to you.  This is a great concept because you get to sit down and drink a beer and FB while you wait.  I still think Five Guys has the best chain burgers around followed by Fuddruckers and Fatburger.  Fukuburger, the Vegas burger truck has mediocre burger patties with incredible sauce.  One of these days, I'll order a Five Guys, wipe everything off it, and put the Smashburger aoili on it or the Fukuburger sauce on it."}
{"text":"This place didn't blow my mind like they build themselves up to do. I got the bacon cheeseburger & it was just ok. The fries were decent but im just not a huge fan of the thin style. However, they were probably the best part of the meal. This place isn't amazing but, if you're a burger enthusiast like me, I would say it's worth a try. The person on the register was pretty rude and seemed like she wanted to be anywhere but there but I've worked in service so I can understand the feeling so I'm not too annoyed with it. The place was clean and my order was right. So in conclusion, eh. It was ok."}
{"text":"After giving the orders to two groups of people that came after us and having our food just sitting there and finally they went to grab the food and noticed it was a \"to go order\" so they put everything in the bag very messy and my chicken sandwiches were sloppy as if a five year old did it. I am not happy with our service today and I am not coming to that joint again!!!! Oh and overpriced food for garbage service, not worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"It is not often I give this high a rating to a corporate chain place. This place is good though, they immediately recognized that we had no idea what to do and walked us through the who order process.

Food, BBQ bacon and cheddar burger, smash fries and a side salad; came out quick and were tasty. Side salad had actual greens on it!! Wow, most burger joints just throw iceberg on a plate and assume you are annoying for ordering salad.

I wasn't super happy with the kid's straws (straws cut in half, which ruins the illusion of sterility completely) and the bathroom was a mess (despite the sign claiming the importance of a clean bathroom). 

I'll check it out again if I am running errands and hungry, as I was today."}
{"text":"The burgers are juicy and delicious.  I get the 1LB patty with bacon and cheese.  The sweet potato fries are amazing.  Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly.  In my opinion they have the best fast food burgers in Las Vegas.  I would go there more often but this is the closest to me and its still a bit of a drive.  I hope they open more."}
{"text":"Came here today and ordered the club with extra crispy bacon, and no mayo/ranch. $6.50. I got a burger with only lettuce and avocado. No bacon? What? 

They only had one guy working the counter so he was swamped with orders but that is no excuse for lacking in quality control. I didn't realize it until I got home so now I have a plain over priced burger."}
{"text":"Good solid burgers, as others have said faster than a sit down place.  My main beef is the price, two people, burgers, fries and sodas over $20?   also the  rosemary fries are a bit heavy on the rosemary in my opinion.  The decor of the place is clean and modernish and the employees do a good job.  I might go back if i were  nearby, in a hurry and wanted a deceit burger, but for the  price I have had better."}
{"text":"I had only the milkshake....betterfinger.....awesome. One of the best ever. The employee even split this into two styfoam cups ( wife has a cold ) so I wouldn't have to drink after her.
Looking forward to trying other menu items"}
{"text":"On my way back from Mt . Charleston I stopped by here because I heard great things about it.  I got the sin city burger,sweet potato fries and IBC root beer.

It was freaking delicious! I mean everything is fried and butter and oil but, it was really oily and yummy.
I couldn't finish the whole burger because it was just juice and butter everywhere.

The fried green bean looked but didn't get to try it.

If you live on that side of town, craving an awesome burger, and don't mind the heart attack this is it!

I can't personally eat like that often because I feel gross afterwards and trying to eat vegetarian.  I wish they had a veggie option tho so, I could have had a choice instead of being \"forced\" to eat meat.  LOL

Whatever, it's good.  If you are around the neighborhood try it.  The price is reasonable.  It's like a strip burger for $5.99"}
{"text":"I have lived by Smashburger for three years and never gone in.  Finally I went in because I saw an ad a few months ago that they have fried pickles, and now that I am pregnant I had a great excuse to get some to-go to try!  The joint was way cleaner then I expected and they had a huge menu that I was not expecting!  They had way more then just burgers- they had salads, tons of sides and milkshakes and even beer.  I had no idea that it was not just burgers.  I only wanted to try the fried pickles though.  The gentleman at the register was super nice to everyone and I heard him being very helpful to each customer in line while I was there and he wished everyone a Happy Valentine's Day.  I did think it was funny that he had $1 in the pen cup so maybe people would tip him but I guess when most people go to fast-food places they don't.  I had no cash on me so I had to pay by credit card for the $3 snack I wanted.  I got home and they were still very hot.  I didn't care for the ranch side so I didn't use that on my pickle slices.  I do expect my pickles to be a bit salty but these were overly salty.  I probably won't come back based on this.  I would rather get my fried pickles from Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings- both those places have banging fried pickles!  Service gets 5 stars but pickles get 1 star.  With cleanliness and menu options I decided on 4 stars."}
{"text":"Initial story: Last night I went to Smashburger with a couple of friends. I was the first one there so I got a chance to look at the menu, a wide selection of beef burgers AND chicken sandwiches! Boy, is it a good thing I had extra time to decide because everything appeared mouthwateringly-delicious. For the longest time (because my friends were late) I was debating over which milkshake to drink, too. In the end I got a Nutter Butter milkshake and a Mushroom Beef Burger. Even though my girlfriends were tardy, I ended up having a WONDERFUL first experience here at Smashburger. 

About the food: I ordered the Mushroom Burger and Nutter Butter Milkshake. As a customer you get to choose which size you would like your burger, and I got a small because I knew I would be ordering a milkshake. The size was perfect! The flavor even more so. Mushroom lovers, come here and order this burger. It was very fresh and tasted spectacular. If possible, I was even more in love with the milkshake! I don't normally eat Nutter Butters but I was craving peanut butter, hence the order of a Nutter Butter Milkshake. The texture is sort of like a soft concrete, which I appreciated very much. Not so liquidy that you have to drink it and it feels gross, but rather you get to use a spoon and straw. Overall, both items satisfied me completely and I will be coming back here again to try other items on the menu. 

About the Service: One man in particular was very kind, the bus boy who I didn't catch the name of...though he was black. I asked him a question in the middle of his cleaning, and he stopped where he was just to get me a glass for water. No attitude or anything, he seemed to have an ambient, chill mood. The cashier (a lady) was nice in the sense of not pushing my friends and I to take our order. (All of us were very indecisive). Nothing great, but not so bad, either. The food came out quickly and for that I am thankful."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to this Smashburger with a few friends. 

The food was great, per usual, but what I really want to comment on is the incredible service! 

Tonight I encountered Carey (Kari?), a woman at the register who was super helpful and kind. She said our order would be out soon, and she meant it! Our burgers were ready within a few minutes! Also, she readily accepted my coupon and even allowed my friend to use the same one. 

I am super thankful to have had her assistance tonight. I will definitely coming back thanks to the food and excellent, speedy service."}
{"text":"We were staying at Rio and saw this burger joint across from chippendales. Located on the second floor by the parking garage walkway. We wanted something easy, quick and not too expensive to eat. Here we are. Burgers are good! We loved the smash fries and tots. You can make your own burger or they have some set burgers as well. I would definitely come back next time I stay at Rio."}
{"text":"I don't eat beef so I am reviewing the \"smashchicken\" sandwiches mostly. I like the buffalo smashchicken. Super flavorful \"smashed\" chicken breast, nice and juicy. Good portion of blue cheese and sauce, and 2 nice big thick slices of tomato with lettuce. Even the bun is good. I've been here twice and both times shared the regular garlic rosemary fries. Perfect on the first visit but last night they were way overcooked. I think this place is a little overpriced for what it is (charging for fries separate? come on) but it is close to my house and a good fix for when I am craving a grilled chicken sandwich with any toppings I want.  Staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Love the menu!! And the smash fries!!!!!! Best thing ever!!  Server was helpful with it being my first timing dining there. Very clean environment. No complaints other than the booth size. My babies car seat couldn't fit so that made us sitting inside kinda tight but outside of that good experience."}
{"text":"Mixed up the order even though it was repeatedly clarified. Missed one of the burgers entirely and the person cooking was arguing with the servers instead of starting on making it. Definitely not going back to this location"}
{"text":"Meh...I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars for this place. Maybe 2.5?

I love the concept of fast casual restaurants (huge Chipotle fan here!), so I was hoping to be impressed by Smashburger's offerings in this space. Unfortunately, my recent experience here was pretty lackluster.

Smashburger purports to be a higher quality burger joint, positioning itself above places like McDonalds and Wendys. The restaurant itself is contemporary and clean and offers a wide variety of burgers and sandwiches, along with sides and shakes. 

I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich with a side of their signature smashfries, my husband got a Steel City burger with a side of sweet potato smashfries, and then we split a Butterfinger shake for dessert. Of note, my husband's food came out before mine did, which was a little annoying. Why can't they sync up meals so a table can eat together? I appreciate them not serving food that has been sitting around getting cold, but at the same time, it seems like there could be better synchrony in the kitchen so that one person doesn't have to watch their partner eat while waiting for their food to arrive (I don't think my husband appreciated me hungrily pilfering his fries since I had no food!)

Anyway, my chicken sandwich consisted of a crispy chicken breast, onion straws, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, and bacon (which my husband promptly stole from my sandwich and ate for himself). I wasn't too impressed with my sandwich. The chicken's breading was flavorful, but the chicken itself seemed to be overcooked (very dry and not juicy). That wouldn't have been as much of a problem if there had been sufficient BBQ sauce on it to provide moisture, but there was hardly any sauce on the sandwich at all (I couldn't even taste it and could barely see it when I opened the sandwich to look for it). The cheese was only half melted. The onion straws were ok, but only served to add to the sandwich's dryness. Overall, pretty disappointing.

My husband thought his Steel City Burger was just okay, and he noted that it was supposed to come with blue cheese, but there was barely any on his burger. It's nice that they're trying to make their burgers more gourmet, but if they skimp on the pricey ingredients, it kind of defeats the point. I do like that they use local BBQ Stu sauce on the Steel City Burger. We've met Stu at several food events, and he's a good guy, so kudos to Smashburger for supporting his business.

The highlight of our meals were the smashfries (both regular and sweet potato). They were crispy with just the right amount of rosemary, garlic, and olive oil flavors that worked well together. The Butterfinger milkshake to end the meal was also pretty tasty...thick and creamy with sufficient pieces of the candy in it.

Service was mixed. The cashier (Amber) was very friendly and hardworking, handling the long line with grace, even when customers kept coming up to her and interrupting her work. However, behind her were two food runner ladies who clearly didn't have enough to do, as they were goofing around and shooting balled-up paper receipts or napkins or something into a trash can. Our poor cashier kept staring daggers at them, and I can't say that I blame her....it sucks to work hard when others around you are slacking off. It seems like it would've been more efficient to have one of those ladies open up a second register, but what do I know?

So, overall, the food was average but not great....probably 3 star food. What makes me rate it a 2.5 overall is the value for the price. For 2 meals (sandwich, fries, drink) and a shake, we were pushing $30 total. That's only a little less than what we normally would spend at Burgatory, and the quality is much lower at Smashburger. For its price point, I think Smashburger probably needs to up its food game to be competitive (and perhaps make a few service tweaks as well)."}
{"text":"I am happy to be the first to review this little gem. The 'gourmet' burger or 'slow fast food' has really been catching on in Calgary. There are a number of choices in the city including some of the more famous American brands like FatBurger and Five Guys. With a South St Co opening nearby in the NW as well, Smashburger was a great find on my visit to the nearby Walmart.

This place is ALREADY very busy and it's staffed with an army of people. The Smashburger name comes from the way they cook their beef, which involves putting a healthy portion of never frozen beef onto the grill and then 'smashing' (it's more like squishing) the burger under a weight. Heat and pressure!

So yeah, fresh patty with generous toppings and the unique \"Calgary\" burger makes this place fall into the gourmet burger category. How does it stack up against the others? Pretty good I would say, really good prices for your food, a fantastic selection of toppings and THE BEST SERVICE YOU WOULD EVER GET IN A BURGER JOINT.

They have people on patrol and ask if you require anything every couple of minutes, which is almost unnecessary since you are too busy stuffing your face and getting your hands messy with the delicious burger. They have great sides too, including the less common fried pickles and mushroom poutine, along with some very delicious milkshakes and REAL iced tea.

If I want a hamburger, it's nice and close by to me so I would prefer paying the slightly higher price here than going to McDonalds or Burger King. There is one catch though. The food is SALTY! Especially the sides. I know some people can't handle it and will complain about it, but hey that's what the milkshake and pop is for. 
Just because it's gourmet doesn't mean it's healthy!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars, not just 4 stars, if I could.

Ok, forget the \"back stories\" - (or read my earlier reviews), and this visit was a make-good for the 5/17/2012 visit and it went great!

Let's cut to the chase: went there today, 3:30pm, got a Large All-American -- AND THEN I MADE IT A DOUBLE!!! -- AND IT WAS FRIGGIN' DELICIOUS!  The right amount of onion, great taste!, huge grease ( a good thing! ).  

Smashburger IS finding it's way...

By the way, the two guys on duty today (at 3:30pm, 6/27/12) a REAL CREDIT TO YOUR COMPANY!  Smiles, friendly, \"it's all good!\", well, let me tell ya, THEY'RE REAL GOOD, TOO.  And I guess the cook gets credit, too.  It was a damned good burger!"}
{"text":"For a quick-ish but delish burger, chicken sandwich or my fave -- the original black bean burger, this place is great!!  It's not your gourmet eatery with a whole lot to choose from, but for a quick yummy burger joint, it's awesome!! Kids love their burgers too, but even more, love their milkshakes!!"}
{"text":"Well, Im finding it really hard to believe all the hype, everyone has been telling me to go to Smashburger, that its amazing.

Well I went. And it was not amazing. I left pissed off that I just $30 something on a couple tasteless burgers and less then spectacular onion strings and a very lumpy shake. 

Save your money."}
{"text":"Great food at this location. 

The restaurant was clean, and we were greeted right away. I got the classic chicken sandwich, grilled and with the spicy chipotle mayo in place of the regular mayo. This is so good!  The fries and chicken were hot, and the veggies were cold. Perfect. I love how thin the chicken is. It's not small either, it is a good sized sandwich. 

My husband said that his burger was perfectly done and juicy. The food at this location is great, and we will travel a ways to return here."}
{"text":"Meh...well, I actually liked my grilled chicken sandwich. My husband did not enjoy his classic burger. Said it was one of the worst he has ever had at any Smashburger. He said that it was not very flavorful, and not juicy. He was disappointed.

On the other hand, I came in wanting something not quite as fattening as a burger. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich which has lettuce, tomato, pickles, red onion and mayo. I asked to switch the mayo for chipotle mayo. I was very pleased with my change, as it turned out great. The chicken patty was nice and thin, and came out hot hot!

I would definitely get this sandwich again, as it had a lof of flavor, especially with the chipotle mayo. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Asked for cold veggies on the side. Did not dissappoint. Got our burgers home, thirty seconds in the microwave and it was as if they had just come off of the grill. Yum!

Got the fries. Really tasty, but kind of frustrating. They are so thin. You have to grab four in order to get any ketchup to stick to them."}
{"text":"We were unfortunate enough to come in last during a rush. We were in line for about 15 minutes. Only one register was open, although there was a manager hanging out in the kitchen. Not sure what she was doing. She was not in any kind of hurry either. 

Ordered to go, and asked for the veggies to be packed separately so that they would remain cold. Along with this, we asked for extra pickles and onions. 

Surprisingly, the food came out quickly. The guys in the kitchen worked fast! We checked the bags to make sure we had our two burgers and box of veggies. Was not until we got home that we realized that they gave us only pickles and onions, no lettuce or tomatoes. That was a disappointment. 

During our entire time here, there were tables with remnants of food left by previous diners. The manager  on this shift was really slacking. Too bad. Burgers tasted great though!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Smashburger? It's a burger joint, and a damn good one. Their smash sauce makes an otherwise ordinary burger extraordinary. The fries could use some work, but that aside, Smashburger is quite simply my favorite casual burger place. Rock on."}
{"text":"Smash Burger is a located at 25 High St SE, Calgary, which is 10 mins away from my home. It is an innovative restaurant. People can create their own burger. My boyfriend took me to Smash Burger on Saturday around the lunch time. We didn't create our own burger, but we ordered pre-made burgers. I had a combo, which is including Smash burger, Smash sweet potato, and pop. My boyfriend ordered Calgary Burger and Oreo Milkshake.  The food came out kitchen very fast. The burger was very fresh. The smash fries were very tasty.  The prices of food were around $30.  We enjoyed our lunch at Smash Burger."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to eat here again she loves the chicken sandwich classic last time and the BBQ this round. I ordered only the fried pickles. They were OK they could have been better. They were over salted and the breading in my opinion should have been crispy. So if u like salty and soft fried pickles these r for u.
I ordered on line and took my time to get there picking it up and my order was still not ready but I did not mind waiting it was maybe 5mins. I would go back for the burgers, fries and shakes."}
{"text":"We were so excited not to have to schlep up to W. Lake Mead when this location opened.  
Great burgers. I had the Baja Burger as is on the menu.  Generous portion and cooked perfectly.  The onion straws were good as well.  I'm planning on trying one of their Smashdogs next time.  

Probably because it was opening day, the staff was very attentive.  
and clean.  

It's only about 1.3 miles from my house so I see great walking opportunities in the Fall & Winter.  Great easy to get into location.  

In spite of the bad economy here, I think they will be a great success."}
{"text":"I had a Phenomenal experience here. Bill (William) was an excellent cashier, very professional. As a former Smashburger employee, I can spot a solid location from this company. This exceeded all expectations. The last time I visited a Smashburger was months ago (at a location in California) and it was a horrendous experience. This restaurant however, really knows how to please a customer and reinstalled trust in me. I had an awesome time and I truly appreciate the Great service that was provided to me. Food was hot and fresh and brought to my table. I loved every bite and I will recommend this burger joint to any friends in the area. Truly appreciate it, Bravo SmashBurger!"}
{"text":"What another great experience! I had Smashburger this morning and it was lovely. This was another lovely experience at another Smashburger. This franchise is doing fabulous work in the Las Vegas Area. Rita, the shift lead, was knowledgeable, polite, and helpful. The cashier, whose name I've forgotten, did a lovely job - as well as did her FOH expert and trainer. This restaurant should see nothing but praise, well done Smash!"}
{"text":"I had this place To-Go when I went up to Sun City to visit my father-in-law for his birthday weekend.  We came from visiting the Phoenix Living History Museum and we were driving home.  I noticed Smashburger on the way to the Museum because their logo is VERY similar to the GameStop logo and color.  Anyway, my boyfriend was the one who suggested this place and their Smash Fries.

We walked into this place, and it seemed pretty decent.  Place was clean,it smelled good, the people taking down orders were attentive and bubbly..  It was cool.  I think the older folks got the Classic Smash Burger, and my boyfriend and I got the California Smash Burger... which had Avocado and the rest of the veggie fixings.  Instead of the regular meat patty, I ordered it with grilled chicken, added jalepenos (I love heat!), and habenero (which is really pepperjack....) cheese.

We took the food home, it was still warm to eat.  The flavor was good, the burgers had a good size.  The burgers when we got it to go were in their individual bags and tagged which one was which.  The individual bags also came with a cute little ketchup packet and napkins, lol.  I completely forgot to order Smash Fries, but my step mom-in-law did and I took a few pieces from her.

If I find this place somewhere in California I wouldn't mind eating from this place again.  Flavor was good, but it doesn't compare to In & Out Burger :)"}
{"text":"We love Smash burger! Everyone was SO friendly. The food is always hot and fresh. Yes, its a little pricey for burger and fries, but i would rather pay for it here then Red Robin... It was a super busy friday night and I was SHOCKED at how fast our food was ready for 7! AND it was ALL correct! A staff member came to our table and asked if we would like to take a survey and enjoy a free order of fries on our next visit, I jumped in and said, \" sure, if you can just read us the questions.\" We were all eating and up to our elbows in food... She said sure and stood there and read us the whole thing!! I will say, mapquest and my GPS still don't recognize this location... The only down side, like someone else commented the parking is HORRIBLE for so many restaurants in one TINY little strip mall."}
{"text":"I had the Sin City Smash.  It was large and really messy...which in my book is a good thing.  I liked the atmosphere and the people were friendly.  My only complaint is that the burger was over salted.  I am not especially sensitive to salt, but it was way too much.  Maybe the cook dropped the shaker on it?  I'll try it again to see if it was a fluke."}
{"text":"I love smashburger and the fries are awesome. It is one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"My first time at Smash. I got the classic with smash fries. Delicious. I might be a little more adventurous with my burger choice next time! Smash Fries were really good! Next time I'll try sweet potato. 

It was super busy. Service was fast and friendly and the place was nice and clean. Our food came out fast! 

I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Let start by saying my husband and I probably don't represent the demographics for this restaurant.  We stopped because we wanted s quick burger and we had a coupon. 

My husband doesn't care for counter-order restaurants.  If there is a line, you feel pressured to make a decision and you can't ask a lot of questions - especially if it is your first visit. 

So sure enough, they rushed him and got the order wrong. He wanted plain sweet potato fries, and they just duplicated my order of seasoned smash tots.  We don't send food back (it was on the receipt that way, and we didn't catch it). So he ate a few and I got the rest.  

The burgers were yummy.  Soft bun, crisp lettuce.  However I have never seen such thin tomato slices in my life!  

We may try it again, but take time to review the menu in advance, so we know what we are getting."}
{"text":"The Smash Fries were heavenly, rosemary and olive oil. 

Burger was great. A little greasy, which I like. Topping choices were good."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out since I hear about it on the radio all the time lately. OMG, I mean I could just die, they have the best shakes to go with the meals, I was going to get a whole meal but I probably wouldn't make it out the door so I just got a shake , they are Hagen daz, I believe,chocolate, ohh just let me die with one in my hand..."}
{"text":"Back in the good ol' meat eating days, this place was bomb-diggity. I love the custom burger option, and it's really wonderful to have a ton of different bread styles. That  might be my favorite part. 

Unfortunately for me, I am fairly uncreative when I am left to my own devices, so they have some great specialty burgers to offer too. Deliciously addicting fries, zesty soda's, and top of the line service. Best \"cheap burger\" place, hands down."}
{"text":"So I have been to plenty of smash burgers and I can say they are all consistent. I have never been to one that was better or worse when it comes to food. 

Where they change is in service and cleanliness. This one was not that busy but had several dirty tables and some that had been wiped down were not wiped well. 

I still they there burgers are better than 5 guys but 5 guys have better fries. I think their shakes are good here as well."}
{"text":"Visited this location two nights in a row while in town on vacation. Had the BBQ bacon burger and smash fries. Both delicious!! Kids loved the Oreo shake too!"}
{"text":"The third or fourth time I went was today, a Saturday afternoon, Always have had good quality, but I have a couple of pet peeves. First the cost, I think kicking it down a is not going to happen but...How about not hosing me for 99 cents for adding a smallish amount of Mushrooms on my Burger and the Fries are 2.69  (i think) and super small order size, yes cool Iron basket with high tech wax paper liner but please Load it up.
I did enjoy a chipolte Bun today and it had a Spicy kick to it which I enjoyed.
So there you go."}
{"text":"Usually, service at most Smashburger's is very good. However, this location/visit proved to be less than, this time around, from the fries not being included in our to-go order.....and no ketchup, either. Once my son started eating his burger....it was super rare throughout. Here's hoping next time is a little better."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch today, ordered my usual black bean burger and got the not so pleasant surprise of finding a hair in my food. It wasn't sitting on top, it had obviously fallen in during food prep as it was inside the bean burger. The assistant manager was very polite and apologetic when he refunded me my money and hoped that they wouldn't lose my business, they will of course, now that I know they have such poor hygiene standards in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have visited several smashburgers.  They are pretty consistent with their food.  I personally like the Classic Smash.  The meat has great flavor.  The smash fries are delicious. 

This particular location was clean.  The prices are average."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places for burgers other than in n out.  Their burgers have a crust layer that makes them so delicious. I normally get the classic smash and my husband gets the big smash. We typically share the smash fries that have aioli and taste  great!  
 
  The staff is always friendly and they bring the food out to you when it's ready.  They are really quick in bringing the food out.  

   The prices are a bit higher because the quality of the meat is higher than your regular fast food joint."}
{"text":"Friendly staff except for like one dude! Love the manager chick. She has provided excellent service even when I am that A-hole walking in at 5 till close! Thank you for not being typical fast food! Chicken is great also!"}
{"text":"Had the Az devil hot dog here, was ok a bit small of a portion. The fries were good, will definately try the burgers next time. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Smash Burger is quite good. The burger I ordered tasted very fresh. The frys were crispy and had a wonderful taste. Not tl salty. Just right. My cashier provided good customer service. The cook in the back is efficient and quick. Great staff."}
{"text":"Smash Burger...why is it named Smash Burger? I suspect it is because they serve hand-formed burger patties. But they also sell fries called \"Smash Fries.\" These fries are not smashed; as a matter of fact they are skinny. All this leads me to believe its called Smash Burger! because the logo & font are super-heroic and reminiscent of   the way a comic book hero smashes his evil nemesis in the neck. \"Smash! Pow! Kaboom!\" I progress...

#1 Burgers are juicy, fresh, and indeed smashed; buns are of the egg-variety; toppings galore.
#2 They serve all beef hot dogs too. 
#3 Outdoor patio is just far enough off the parking lot with just enough planters filled with just enough flowers to make it almost, just almost seem like a sidewalk cafe in a real city.
#4 Plenty of space for dining and lingering. 
#5 Smash Fries are strange because they are herbed yet had no herbs. It was as if they smashed the potatoes, mixed the mush with herbs or herb-like bits, reconstituted the potatoes into fry-like shapes and fried them up. The result was fries with an herbal essence, not herbed fries. Perhaps not an issue for you (certainly not a deal breaker for me) but worth noting. 

Overall a pleasant experience to be consumed at Smash Burger. If you endeavor, go on a nice day and feel, almost feel, like you reside in a \"real city.\"  KABOOM!"}
{"text":"Fast,friendly staff,great service and clean.we've been hear countless times,consistently good."}
{"text":"Best burger  in town. Angus beef , smoked bacon, avocado, the best.. your missing out if you have never been.. oh did I say a beer with your burger. Love the fries too. Thanks Smash Burger......"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best cheeseburger I've had for years. We arrived at Harrahs in Laughlin about 6 pm and we're hungry so we tried smash burger. Normally we go to a steakhouse at least once on our quick trips to Laughlin. The next night we decided to back to smash burger instead of a steak. Maybe wired to some but if love a great cheeseburger that's your best bet."}
{"text":"This is our first time in this location and I will never be back.  The place is filthy, I mean almost too dirty to stay and eat.  There are only 6 customers here.  It took forever to take our order cuz the 2 guys that were workers were playing around on a computer and ignored us standing there.  I specifically asked if they were still open because it appeared we were bothering them.  He said, no, we're open til 10pm, \"we're just tired\".   
My food came out wrong and didn't taste good and I'm just done! 
GROSS!"}
{"text":"Not necessarily the best burger in town but quality ingredients and boy is it served fast.  The truffle mushroom burger and tots are my favorite.  The single is big enough for me but smaller than what I would expect. There is some parking but not a lot. Wasnt a problem when we went but I could see how it could fill up fast."}
{"text":"Tried Smashburger for the first time and would have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered their standard burger with all trimmings and found it to be better than anticipated.  Not so much for the fries.  The order we received was nothing but a pile of schnibbles..... fries that were about 1\" long and looked like a bunch of broken pieces.  I did say something to to the Gal that took our order and she could have cared less.  If it weren't for the fries, I would have given a 4 star rating.  I would recommend the burgers but stay clear of the fries."}
{"text":"Not a big burger fan here but hey, when in Rome right? Rob brought me here and told he he'd order for me so i wouldn't have and prejudges. 

We sat down and when our burger arrived. Service was very friendly and fast and she even went for our tap waters while this wasn't part of the service at all.

The Sin City burger definatly hit the spot! The sauce was awesome! Burger perfectly cooked and a nice crispy bun. 
No more mcDonalds for me. I'd rather pay 6 bucks more for this feast!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah I will smash it!  Not!

Okay.. I like burgers.. Well food in general.   But I appreciate good juicy, greasy, fat melting burger.  That's what burger is all about!! FAT!! MEAT!! So I figure this place will satisfy my  taste buds and my belly!

  Well,..... I was wrong..  =  /

Maybe I was expecting little too much or perhaps person who was cooking that day was mad at the world and decided to take out his anger on the burger by smashing it!!   Because my burger looked like someone got confused between cooking the juicy burger and beef jerky.    I mean, it was so dry, it reminded me of my friend's 4th of July BBQ party!  Really? Do I must experience that all over again?

I am sure I was one of the hundreds who got the bad burger of the day.. If they had a section of the wall saying, \"Hall of shame burger\" and I would be on it.. Oh boy was it terrible!

But during my second visit.  Burger wasn't too bad, but still didn't satisfied my taste bud.   All I tasted was.. average burger at average burger shop with average price for average service..  Maybe I am not your average guy? Then again, In-n-Out always hit the spot for me...

Maybe my taste buds are confused..  :  /

Anyway!!!
Don't let name \"smash burger\" fool you thinking that's one smashing burger.. Just expect the average and nothing more!"}
{"text":"My boss took us here as a group for lunch. A lot of us ordered and everything came out right and quickly. The food was good. The limited experience with the staff was good."}
{"text":"Smashburger is pretty good, even though the decor is terrible. 

I have been there several times before this review, so I'll make just a general review. 

The burgers are juicy and flavorful, I highly recommend the Arizona, and the BBQ Bacon burgers. Fresh meat, freshly cooked, perfectly seasoned. The egg buns are perfectly toasted and delicious. 

As for the sides, don't go for the onion straws. You don't really get enough, and the flavor isn't anything spectacular. If you're craving them, grab the BBQ Bacon burger, which is the perfect combination. 
The sweet potato fries are basically sweet potato fries, nothing special. 

The veggie frites are where it is at. Lightly fried and delicious carrots, zucchini, and asparagus. 

My only issue is that the sides could be a little more for what you pay.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"So after a late night of errands the boyfriend and I stopped into smash burger on the way home. It was going to be a quick bite and then home. The place looked clean and casual, great! Just what I wanted!
We ordered smash fries, Oreo milkshake, and him a bacon cheddar beef burger, and I a make your own bean patty burger. 
The patty on mine was... Smooshy and paste like in looks and taste- not a fan. But the dressing and the bun were good. The smash fries were excellent- would return only for fries. The shake was also pretty tasty. Nothing too exciting here (sans delish fries) 
...was really hoping for a stellar veggie patty though."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed. I've had better burgers at Wendy's and it was over $20 for 2 regular burgers, fries, and drinks. Also it was beautiful outside and we wanted to sit on the patio but 3 of the tables were dirty and the others were taken. These tables and others near us inside weren't cleaned the entire time we ate. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The place was filthy dirty. Food all over the floors and the tables looked as if they had not been wiped down for months. We were the only people in the restaurant, so it's not because they were busy. We have been to Smashburger before in other states and have always been pleased. This location is in need of some TLC and some serious cleaning. We will not be back and do not recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Good but have had better.....one thing my wife and I did not like is no garnish on burger.   Gotta ask for lettuce tomato pickles onion....really?  My first time there probably last due to 25.00 tab and no offer of toppings."}
{"text":"Seems like it used to be better. I feel it has gone downhill so it's not worth the money so much anymore. It's still better than a regular fast food place, but I wish they would up the bar to where it use to be."}
{"text":"Disappointing. This place used to be great but it's gone downhill. You know it's bad when my wife doesn't eat the bacon on her burger because it's barely cooked.

Took a while for food to come out, the quantity of fries was very small, just seems like the management isn't paying attention to putting out a quality product at this location anymore"}
{"text":"Yeah that was a good burger & the service was top notch. The staff was very accommodating. I felt well taken care of & was even offered a to go cup for the road home. I'll be checking in for sure. They should post some check-in deals, just a thought. So yeah get your smash on."}
{"text":"Burgers are ok. Fries are to plain with no taste but over it's an ok place to eat. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a tasty burger, this is definitely the place for it.

I went with a 1/3 lb. Mushroom Swiss, with an order of their haystack fries on the side. Upon first bite, my mouth exploded with flavor. This thing was delicious. After the first couple of bites, I had already regretted not getting the bigger 1/2 lb. version. Each bite was pure bliss. Although, it was a bit too greasy for my tastes. Fat does equal flavor though, so sometimes you just gotta roll with it, especially if you're hungry.  The haystack onions taste just like you would expect it to taste, except they were excessively greasy. Definitely nothing to rave about. And this time, the excess oil was unwarranted. It was like they didn't even shake off the oil when it came from the fryer. For a $2 side, you'd think you'd get a bigger quantity, but you don't really get much of it at all. I'd definitely recommend getting the SmashFries instead.

I'm definitely down to come back to this place to try the Sin City Burger. Of course, it'd have to wait for a while. Just this one stop to this place already filled my monthly grease intake quota."}
{"text":"Kevin needs an attitude adjustment regardless of if you're counting your drawer down or not you should notify the next person on shift that a customer is in line let alone there's a line (three or more people in line). If you can't serve with a good tude through and through then you shouldn't serve. Jillian though redeemed his crassness by her awesomeness not the discount she gave me. Side note answer the phone when it rings."}
{"text":"Went back here after a long hiatus. I was sad to see that they removed the smaller sized salads from the menu. Plus, they don't offer the raspberry vinaigrette anymore. Doesn't really work for someone who usually wants a more healthy and affordable alternative for lunch.

The harvest chicken salad is still plentiful and tasty, but it just costs too much with the large size for a regular lunch. I know I'm kinda silly for not getting the burgers here, but a habit of burgers just won't do when I eat lunch outside on the daily."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here I honestly was not that impressed. I decided to wait a bit and give it another chance. I have recently eaten there a couple of times and although I am not convinced that the pricing is particularly on point the two mushroom and swiss burgers I had were honestly very good. The shakes were also tasty. Although Mad Mikes is still my favorite burger around, you can do a heck of a lot worse than Smashburger if you get a craving."}
{"text":"Smashburger, in my opinion, offers the most exceptional Strawberry Shake, second only to Burgerville's in Oregon!  And, since discovering Smashburger, we've been fascinated by the exquisite juiciness of their burgers, but this last visit I must say, they were pretty dry.  My Arizona Smash although not juicy, its concentration of flavors with jalapeños, guacamole, pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, onion & chipotle mayo on a chipotle bun somewhat made up for the lack.  Unfortunately, my wife's BBQ Bacon Cheddar Smash although tasty, too had her miffed by its dryness.  Although a very consistent operation, with really good service and hospitality as well as cleanliness, I may begin to score and categorize Smashburger with the rest of my 1 to 5 Fast Food Joint ratings - up until now, I had not really considered it Fast Food per se.  Let's see how they do next visit - I hope better!"}
{"text":"If I could give it a negative rating I would! My first time ever eating at Smashburger and my last! I have food poisoning now and can't even keep any water down! I am disgusted and angry! I got the bbq ranch chicken salad! BEWARE!"}
{"text":"With all the 5 star ratings I was really keyed up to try a Smashburger. Here's what I found:
+'s  My burger was cooked to perfection,(if you don't care for pink in the middle, ask for well done) the onion, lettuce & tomato was fresh & crisp. We liked the hamburger bun.
Three kinds of tea! Clean booths and the music was at a level that we could talk to each other. The service was friendly and helpful.. 

-'s:  Great fries can make up for a lame burger and maybe fair service, but  little inch long or shorter matchstick fries are the ruin of a good burger place.. The smash fries aren't anything extra and we wound up dunking them and our fingers in ketchup. 
Over $17.00 for 2 burgers,a rather small order of fries and an ice tea. We lucked out on parking. I can see that parking would be an issue where they are busy. Wish we had tried the haystack onion rings. No Veterans discount. I signed up on the internet for the Smashclub and was hoping for a discount coupon, Didn't happen  Wanted to give a four, but there are better out these at about half the price."}
{"text":"Cashier: Is this your first time visiting Smashburger?
Me: Yes it is.
Cashier: Excellent choice then.

I tried their blackbean vegan burger which was very good and made in the restaurant (not from freezer).  Was definitely full after eating here.  Good food in a casual but well decorated atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is decent.  Little pricey for what you get.  Burger was cooked right and juicy."}
{"text":"Really good burger, but to be honest the prices are a bit high.  The wait a bit long, and I usually put burgers in two categories.  Fast food burgers you can pick up at a drive thru, and get our of your car sit and eat burgers.  Smash burger is a fast food burger disguised as a get out and sit burger.  And with Create not even a half a mile down the road I'm always gonna end up at create.  Definitely worth a try though."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cobb salad and they added sunflower seeds and cranberries that are supposed to be on the harvest salad, not the Cobb. Unfortunately, I'm very allergic to sunflower seeds and must've eaten quite a few before I realized it (they had fallen to the bottom). 

Spent the whole night on the bathroom floor trying not to die."}
{"text":"One of my very favorites burgers. Juicy and oh soooo delicious. I like this location. It's right by my house, never crowded, friendly service. My whole family enjoys coming here."}
{"text":"Smash burger is good.  This one, however, is extremely poorly run and if it's a corporate store the office should not be fooled by the revenue this location is generating because when the \"new\" ness of this place wears off  the revenue will dip because all people will remember is the experience and at this location that's a problem.  It's a busy Sunday and the line is 10 minutes long just to order, literally out the door.  The food comes out fine but don't asked for any silverware, for the kids, because you will wait yet again.  The beverage station is destroyed with empty containers where supplies should be and the trash cans are literally overflowing.  Did I mention I witness an associate give a customer a rag to bus their own table???

The management team here should be ashamed of how this place is run.  McDonald's is a better experience......."}
{"text":"The worst Smashburger ever! The wait is 30min, never correct and the management gets defensive when you ask questions. My father in law is the nicest man and was told to sit down after waiting for 30 min, when his food was wrong, then another 20, only to get a burnt burger! Some members of our party received a refund so they went to another restaurant where they were happy to see us. It starts with poor leadership....Natalia! Bad attitudes are contagious and don't make good examples in a service industry. Look around.....burger joints everywhere, many better choices than this place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with their veggie black bean burger. It wasn't as tasty as I was hoping. But the Smashfries were really good! They also have beer here which is awesome! I only wish they had veggie patties to offer instead of the bean burger."}
{"text":"Great service today.Cashier was sweet and helpful and food was fast and hot.My spinach,goat cheese burger was a good size.Not too big or small.Would go again for a quick lunch.Cost us around 22 bux for 2 meals with drink and side.Way better than McDonalds or Burger king.Really like it!"}
{"text":"I am so pissed and beyond disappointed with my order and the way it was packaged. Look at the disgusting fries!!! My dog won't even eat it!!! If your going to have a business in food to do it right and serve it right!!! I can't describe the fries it was so freaking hard and what the heck is on it??? Sick"}
{"text":"I have never eaten at Smash Burger. I tried today. The lot was crowded but I found a spot. I walked in. I was immediately stopped by some smiling employee, I thought, huh that's a nice touch.... greeter. He quickly said, \"Sir we are experiencing a 35 minute wait at this time, we got rocked.\" Huh. I have had SURGERIES that were shorter than that! Thanks for warning me. But don't think I will bother to come back."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. That baby was very filling and it satisfied me for the rest of the day. I liked the fast casual atmosphere and the price reflects that it is a few notches above a regular old fast food burger joint. 

The best part for me were the smash fries which are made with rosemary and olive oil. I know that everyone has a personal preference for fries and they hit most of the points for me. They were fresh tasting, just a tad bigger than shoestring, and not over-salted. I think I may just get an order of fries next time!"}
{"text":"First time I at Smash was at ASU campus. Had no idea that I would grow to like it so much. There's one by the movie theaters to so we've eaten there several times. I get the Classic Smash and the side of Smashfries (has olive oil and rosemary). Thin sliced and super good."}
{"text":"The rating is more of a 3.5 but I rounded down considering I rated Five Guys 4 stars.

The fries are too thin.  You can't taste any potato.  Additionally, I paid for the special oil something-or-other.  It didn't add any flavor, it just made them greasy.

I got a bbq bacon cheeseburger.  Good quality hand packed hamburger.  A bit too well done for my liking. Carmelized bacon was really good.  BBQ sauce was just regular KC Masterpiece or something.

It was a pretty good burger, I will admit.  But it's not as good as Five Guys and that's their most similar competition.  Prices are a tad bit better than Five Guys though."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. Literally the best burger I have ever had. Everyone was so friendly and helpful as well. I couldn't believe how yummy this place was. I am already craving another one!"}
{"text":"Great burger place where they use fresh products! Service was amazing and the food was even better, will always love this location for my burger cravings!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing the reviews for Smash Burger and when I heard that they opened up one near us we decided to give it a try. 

We walk in and the setup is just like at Fudruckers. Order at the cashier and have a seat but instead, they bring the food out to your table. The cashier was very helpful and really nice. 

I forgot what the burger's called but it had guac, onions and jalapenos... I asked for the jalapenos on the side, no big stink like at other places I've been to. I was really impressed with the burgers. They were juicy and the toppings were yummy! The patty to bread ratio was pretty good. 

Bussers were really nice and very accommodating. 

We'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"There was not a clean table although there were many empty ones, and there was no garbage can to allow us bus tables. It was not busy, so the servers were not working very much. My son ordered a buffalo blue cheese and there was no buffalo sauce on it. The portions seem to have gotten much smaller since last time we were here."}
{"text":"I stopped here with a co-worker after a shopping excursion at Hobby Lobby. We called to place an order to go and they normally do not take phone orders, but the gal made an exception. (This was really nice of her!) I ordered the chicken sandwich with avocado and bacon. I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. The only problem is when you take it to go, the fries don't survive! They get wilted and I like 'em crunchy. The sandwich was pretty good - I liked the flavors but the chicken was greasy. I wouldn't order it again, unless the chicken was less greasy. My co-worker enjoyed her food, but I don't always trust her judgment. (I mean, she was okay with limp fries.) If in the area, I might go back. Who knows?"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this particular Smashburger location, but after the movie we needed a little snack and decided to go here. My husband really enjoys Smashburger's French fries since they are crispy and made with rosemary. Since he decided to order these, I decided to try a chocolate malt shake. There were two employees working the register, a male and a female. Only two customers in front of us, and slowly a line behind us started to form. The male employee finished taking a customer's order, but quickly answered the phone. The female employee helped the customer's in front of us, and since the male employee was still on the phone, she then took our order. She was nice and helpful and since our order was to-go, she told us we could wait nearby. By the time we sat down, the male employee left and only the female employee was taking orders. The line got longer and longer and she was left alone to man the registers the entire time.

It took about 15 minutes to get our fries and shake. The shake didn't look or taste like chocolate and there was no malt flavor whatsoever. I made my husband taste it and he agreed. I went back in to make sure I received the correct shake. The female employee who made my shake immediately and defensively told me she put malt in it. I asked if she could add more, since I couldn't taste it. She took my shake, dumped the entire thing (whipped cream and all) into a metal shake container, put more malt and chocolate sauce in it, and then mixed it up. In the end, it was slightly (only slightly) more chocolately, but still no discernible malt flavor and now it wasn't thick but very thin. For $4, the shake was not worth it and my husband agreed. Culver's or even Which Wich makes much better chocolate malt shakes.

Overall, I would not order a shake from here ever again. My husband enjoyed his fries, but if we had to wait in that long line (where only one employee was at the registers) to order fries, I'd skip it. They really need to get more employees in here, especially during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"a wide selection of burger choices. yummy rosemary and garlic fries. portioning could be bigger for the price you pay. clean location. ample seating and parking"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the Park Road area. If you are looking for a good hamburger, delicious garlic/herb fries then Smash Burger is a must visit. Even though our visit was during their first week, the service was great, they are trying very hard and I am sure will be running like a well-oiled machine in no time. This is not the easiest location to get in and out of if you are driving and trying to park, but what place is now days. I recommend parking by Viva Chicken and walking over."}
{"text":"After a heavy workout, I decided to take a friends advice & give this place a shot for the first time for my post-workout protein fix.... I usually don't \"experiment\" with my food after a workout because i'm usually EXTREMELY hungry at that point & I obviously want things to be right with my food during this critical \"post-workout\" time window... Needless to say, I knew I was taking a big risk here... As someone who needs to keep their carbs low, I generally eat my burgers &/or chicken sandwiches WRAPPED in lettuce (with no bun) & I never get fries, so the size/quality of the burger/sandwich patty is kind of a big deal or else i'm walking out hungry... The point when ordering it this way is that the lettuce takes the place of the bun, & common sense means that you wrap the lettuce further (in either paper or thin aluminum) in order to keep the sandwich from making a mess & falling apart in the person's hands... Because this should be common sense, I rarely explain all of this in full detail when ordering burgers &/or chicken sandwiches with lettuce & no bun (I expect that they would know)... For good measure, I called in advance to make sure I could order it this way & was told that I could. 

I get there, place my order & take my seat to wait for my food. It comes out, & wow what an unpleasant surprise.... First off, they slapped the chicken patty over a thin slice of lettuce with tomato/onion & there was another piece of lettuce on the side but nothing to wrap around it so that I could actually make it into a wrapped sandwich (without making a complete mess & having it fall apart)... I literally had to wrap it up in a napkin just to keep it together, which is not something I enjoyed as the napkin was like toilet paper & it basically dissolved into the lettuce as I was eating it (as a result of the moisture from the patty/tomatoes/onions/etc)... Furthermore, what REALLY ruined my first-time dining experience was the fact that the chicken patty was so thin/flat I probably could have slid it through the crack under the front door & still had room left to fit my finger in-between the patty & the bottom of the door... Maybe I should have done more research in advance (in regards to how this place came up with it's ingenious name), but I was not aware that this place completely smashes the meat in their burgers/sandwiches to a point where it is almost paper thin... This is one reason why I don't like \"In-n-out\" Burger, because they do this with their burgers & if you get it on a bun YOU CANT EVEN TASTE THE MEAT (all you taste is BREAD)... I absolutely hate that, & to my dismay Smashburger seems to follow this same process: Needless to say that with that paper-thin patty & no bun/fries (both of which are carb-heavy), I walked out of the place just as hungry as I was when I walked in. 

The chicken patty was probably a good 1.5-2 ounces (if that) once they got done destroying it & what a shame as it actually tasted quite good... But to pay close to TWELVE DOLLARS for a thin little chicken patty+medium drink & STILL walk out hungry? That's unacceptable & bad business... The place is a complete ripoff as far as i'm concerned & while I may give the milkshakes a shot someday, I definitely won't be ordering any more chicken sandwiches or burgers there. Yeah it tastes good, but if you're walking out of there just as hungry as you were when you came in, that's a problem. I'll spend my money elsewhere or just make it myself (plenty of copycat recipes online) & i'll actually feel like I ate a meal because I won't squash it to death... For those reading this, if you want an AWESOME burger that will absolutely fill you (even if you get it wrapped in lettuce like me), give \"The Stand\" a shot on Indian School Rd. AWESOME, reasonably priced & you'll definitely be full (& no I don't work for them, I just eat there often as I live in the area). MORAL OF THE STORY: When in doubt, STICK WITH WHAT YOU KNOW!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a smashing experience at smashburger. I ordered the Spicy Jalepena Baja burger.  It comes with guac and pepper jack cheese, chipotle sauce on a chipotle bun. All above sounds good. The burger itself was a single and a little smaller than I would expect but with the gummy rosemary tots it was more than enough. You can also get the double if you want more beef. I will probably be back to try the truffle burger and will prob opt for the larger burger and get shake to go with it. This location was very fast and efficient. Also friendly."}
{"text":"Good food! Love that they don't charge for extra ranch. But! they need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"Worst service. I've lived here for 4 years and every time we have ever come it's a 30-40 min wait if not longer. I've had meals comped bc of it. Un-real. I'm here getting my teens and they have been waiting for 1 french fry and 2 shakes for 40 min!!! People are walking out furious. If you come here just expect to wait at this location. There could be zero line and I promise you will wait. Food is good if you have no where else to be. 

Sucks. I never write bad reviews...... but this place is terrible as far as service goes. Is one guy making everything OR WHAT? I think so."}
{"text":"Great burger joint! Lots of options I had the BBQ bacon burger and my husband had the blue cheese burger. The fries were crispy and hot and I loved how the onion rings were thin cut with sauce, it was a little pricey but worth it. Shakes are good too"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 and not 4 stars is because the black bean burger wasn't that good. I've had plenty of black bean burgers in my life, but the patty was a bit mushy--the consistency was just off for some reason. I can't explain it. 

The fries were the only saving grace.  Man those things are good. Thin and crispy the way they should be.  

The BB burger is really my only option since I don't eat meat. Maybe I will go back for the fries."}
{"text":"I reallly don't like the cheap meat that is made so thin that they serve.  I only experienced the hamburger, and that surely wasn't impressive by any means.  Meh....not so good.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Seen Smashburger on the side of the road while up from Medicine Hat on a shopping trip. Didn't feel like going to a regular fast food joint so we stopped in on a whim.  Restaurant was really clean. The people taking orders were extremely friendly and the food was delicious. I tried the BBQ bacon burger and the smash fries and they both did not disappoint. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted a burger and haystack onion rings.  I saw a burger sitting in the window waiting to be delivered for about 5 minutes, only to have it delivered to me.  They were not busy, it was 8 pm.  The onion rings were cold, and to make it worse, they were 2 clumps of undercooked breading that tasted overwhelmingly of salt. I had ordered the bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and standard condiments.   It arrived with a smear of mustard on the top bun. The bacon consisted of 3 pieces, each about 2 inches long.  The main flavor from the burger was mustard.  A totally disappointing experience.   I won't go back."}
{"text":"One of the most yummy, easy and convenient lunches I've had in a long time!! I've been to a few smash burgers before and this was the best one I've been too!! 
The service was fast and efficient. My burger was made neatly and didn't fall apart after the first bite! My go to burger was the Arizona burger. It comes with some amazing guacamole and jalapeños! 
If you haven't had the SMASH FRIES, those are a must."}
{"text":"Always looking for a place that will be fast and efficient for a lunch break. It didn't seem to be very busy but they were going to fast they weren't paying attention to the few modifications on our burger. As simple as no onions or tomatoes. 2 out of 3 burgers were made incorrectly. We ended up waiting a total of 25 min. Next time it will definitely be worth calling ahead, as I saw many people did. 
If you have the time it's worth grabbing a bite here. 

The food is yummy and fresh. The burgers are on the smaller side. 
SMASH FRIES ARE AMAZING! 
The Arizona burger is the best, it comes with jalapeño and some yummy gauc!"}
{"text":"Food is good restaurant was clean and the order was made right . My only issue is getting the wrong amount back in change . I paid with a 50 and didn't get proper change back . SMH moment for sure"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I truly feel bad for anyone who ranks Smashburger at the top of their list of burger rankings. Seriously. Send me a message. We'll talk. I want to help you!

Anyway . . .

I first went into a Smashburger several years ago and over time, my opinion of them has dropped considerably. It's not so much that they've changed, it's just that I've learned that better burgers can be found elsewhere - especially when you realize that serving beer at a fast food restaurant isn't quite as \"exotic\" as it might have been in 2010.

I think the biggest problem with Smashburger is that their burgers are too damned salty. I mean, on a good day, you might be okay, but there have been several instances where the salt overpowers the whole burger entirely! I find this to be unacceptable, especially given their price point. Their signature Smashfries are edible, but nothing really special, in my opinion.

I think if there's one thing Smashburger is good at, it's marketing themselves at a \"premium\" burger place, despite really being no different than any other corporate fast food joint. Yes, their burgers take significantly longer to make than many similar places, but that doesn't mean they're necessarily any better. I'm sorry, but you can't fool me!

Look hard, my friends. There are better places out there. Much, much better places."}
{"text":"Last night, food was tasty per usual. Our visit started with a long and slow moving line. But the customer service was exemplary from start to finish. Kudos to Anissa, who was working extra hard to keep customers happy! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat there this afternoon, 12/06/15, however, location was closed at 5:15pm. Website says they are open till 10:00pm. Employees looked at me as I tried to open the door but offered no explanation. Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Another burger place.  Don't get me wrong, I love hamburgers, but I don't need more temptation to eat another burger.  This is the third one within a mile, not including McDonlds and The Vine.

It was not easy getting into this place either if you're East bound on Elliot Rd.
I drove around that parking lot looking for a way on that doesn't currently exist.   :-p

I will tell you service was prompt and polite.  Menu appears to have some decent options.
My fail was to combine some toppings on the burger that just didn't blend well.  I don't understand.  Blue cheese, spinach, tomatoe, and onion is GREAT as a salad.  On top of a burger it was blech.  
Burger was well done, as in overcooked.  And greasy.
The egg bun is good.
French fries are alright.
Shake was tasty, but how often do you encounter a shake fail.  

Personally, I dont think we'll be back here very often."}
{"text":"Fun environment! I love the way this restaurant runs. Fast casual dining style. I love sweet potato fries and there's are quiet delicious. I normally get a Chicken sandwich sans bread, lettuce wrapped instead with tomato, avocado and bacon! 

My kids always split a chocolate shake and go crazy when it comes out. A fun place for sure for a quick bite and way better quality than standard fast food."}
{"text":"It's the same as the others.  Good location by the freeway.  Staff was friendly.  Good came out fast.  Business was clean.  Bathrooms were clean.  Those sweet potato fries are incredible."}
{"text":"I am always drawn to this place.  The bacon cheeseburger is above average.  Plus the fries here....I devour them.  Service is always standard.  Nothing ever \"wows\" me here.  But I prefer this over other burger spots."}
{"text":"I have been to other SB before.  Staff was friendly and the dinning area was clean.  No issues with my order as it was perfect.  The sweet potato fries were amazing and a must have.  Good was brought out quickly and it was freshly made."}
{"text":"The burgers are still good, but the last two times I have gone the smash fries have been unedible.  Too greesy (like they grease was not hot enough and just soaked in) and just barely warm.  Other foods is good though."}
{"text":"Update - First operator I have been contacted by that reads their Yelps!  Great job, Smashburger!  The rep reviewed my review and sent some Smashbucks to give them another try , which I will certainly do!

Customer service bonanza!

------------
Burger was tasty but far too greasy; it might have been juicy as well but there was too much grease to tell.

Fries were frozen product, so so.  

In all, nothing to brag about and don't wear a good shirt."}
{"text":"This is not a review about the food, rather; it is a review about the order.  We (group of 7 people) ordered online.  Ordering online was great - went smoothly, no issues.  Went to pick up, each order had the ticket with the name and what was ordered bagged up individually.  Great, right?  WRONG!  EVERY. SINGLE. ORDER. was wrong.  How is this even possible?  All 7 of us got the wrong order?  For what we paid for this, I would expect better."}
{"text":"Fast service and a very good burger.  The veggie fries were a nice change.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited this smash tonight and it was packed! The general manager lady was working the front counter, making shakes, running food and cleaning tables! She was multitasking like a boss! The line never stopped either and she maintained everything all at once! It was insane! The gentlemen that was working with her was a shift leader and he was also multitasking like crazy! You can tell someone had to of called off or something but they handled it perfectly! The food came out and it was awesome like usual too! Love this smash burger!"}
{"text":"As I walk down University Avenue along the ASU campus I see the usual suspects; coffee houses, bookstores, and oodles of fast food joints.  Today there is a new kid in town.  Smashburger.

A fresh take on the classic fast food burger joint, Smashburger offers made-to-order burgers; Rosemary, olive oil, garlic fries (Smashfries); and Haagen-Dazs shakes.  Every Smashburger is made when it's ordered, so don't come here if you are late to class; the wait from order to delivery is about five to seven minutes, and you'll want to take your time enjoying these burgers.  Smashburger takes a different approach to burger preparation - they start with a one-third or half pound ball of 100% fresh Angus beef; smash, sear, and season it on a flat grill, then serve it on a buttered-toasted artisan bun and top it with cheese, fresh produce and condiments. The result is an irregularly shaped, juicy, delicious burger.

I stopped down there today for the grand opening and tried the BBQ, Bacon, &amp; Cheese Smashburger ($5.99) with Smashfries ($1.79), and Veggie Frites ($2.99).  Right away I noticed that the Smashburger differentiates itself from other burgers with ambrosial seasonings and juiciness.  Yes, this burger was juicier than Perez Hilton gossip at a Hollywood red carpet event.  These guys really have the searing down to a science.  A few other points of interest - the Smashfries are delicious; the whole rosemary, garlic, oil coating really works well.  Points for the Veggie Frites, too.  You get a nice blend of asparagus, carrots, and green beans, which are flash fried and seasoned, then served hot to your table. They offer a few other menu items including a Smashchicken sandwiches, Smashdogs, and Smashsalads (if you're into that healthy stuff).

If Smashburger has a weakness, it's the hours of operation.  I mean, come on.. you are operating on a college campus and closing at 10 PM every night?  Seriously?  One thing ASU needs are more places to soak up all that alcohol after a long night on the sauce.  I'll give Smashburger a half point back for opening at 10 AM to help cure the hangover the next day.  I have a feeling that a smashed, seared burger and greasy coated fries may remedy the brown bottle flu.

Overall, Smashburger is a hit and is sure to win the hearts and minds of hungry college students roaming the streets of Tempe, Arizona."}
{"text":"Really great burgers...I would hope so with a name like Smashburger. This location is really good, so it gets busy at lunch time. Waiting is a bit of a pain, but it's typically not too long. The food takes a few minutes too, which is a positive in my book. The food here feels a lot fresher and better than fast food, though if you've seen their burgers, it's not a place that's super healthy.

They also offer chicken sandwiches (crispy or grilled), and salads, so there are some healthier options, but the winners here are the burgers and fries. Definitely try the smash fries. Tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, they are delicious. Burgers are really good and juicy, and the ingredients they use seem fresh.

Cons are the long lines, and it's also not a place where you'll be in and out in 15 minutes. It's also not inexpensive. A burger, fries and a drink will run you $10-11, which seems high for \"fast food\", though I think it's worth it. What's nice though, is that you sit down with your number and they bring you your food, and they'll bus your table, so it feels like a combo of fast and full service...I suppose this is a perfect example of \"fast casual\". 

It's pretty close to my office, so I'll be back often. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and craving a burger."}
{"text":"I ordered a BEEF hamburger and got a BLACK BEAN patty. Unacceptable and disappointing. It's enough to make me never go there again."}
{"text":"Update, I was contacted by Smashburger and they sent me some free entrees to try them again. Let's see how they do next time. I'm glad to see that there was concern from them regarding this last experience!"}
{"text":"The service at Smashburger is excellent. Quick order & delivery to you table. Also, they have gluten free buns. Good for those with dietary needs or just living the gluten free lifestyle."}
{"text":"I had heard they were spiced just right but for me it was too salty of a burger.  It was also expensive considering a I had a burger, hot dog, fries and a shake.  Not a favorite but wouldn't mind coming again."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, I ordered a chicken sandwich found a hair in it, they said they would make a new one. They didn't they just put the stuff back on it. My previous order said no Onion since I'm allergic. It came back with onion on it. The manager didn't really seem to care. I could see threw the window all of the employees didn't have hats or hair nets. I waited about 10 minutes after this, to see if they'd put there hats on an they didn't. How disgusting!!! I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Love the food here as you can taste the freshness versus some of the other fast food places. Plus, they have a variety of healthier options."}
{"text":"Great burgers and the customer services was on point! They have every aspect of a gourmet burger shop perfected. Third time here and always pleased!"}
{"text":"I had the Mushroom burger , it tasted good , and I ordered the Greek fries for 1.99 the fries to me, for that price I thought would be on a more grander scale. They were regular Shoestrings with just olive oil and a spec of seasoning on it. I felt I needed to put salt in it after all. Other than that service was friendly. Just a bit overpriced for me overall."}
{"text":"The service wow. So slow. More customers than employees and it took forever to even place an order. Food is great but not better than in and out burger. When they open on Sahara they will put this place out of business. Note to companies if you're a \"fast food type\" place --be fast. 
If I wanted to wait 30 minutes I would have went to a restaurant and sat down to a clean table. Yes the table was dirty too"}
{"text":"When it comes to burgers I consider myself a professional critic. With comparison to Ho-Dad's in San Diego, Smashburger has won the competition! Their food is delicious and the customer service that goes along with it is nothing less in comparison. The cashier who took my order was very helpful in helping me decide what I wanted (by the way, the Sin City Burger is the way to go). Then she even brought it out to my table! To my surprise, after my meal she even cleaned my table! What customer service! Ally is definitely the person you want taking care of you, and let me tell you, I took care of her as well with a gracious tip! Remember to tip your waiter!"}
{"text":"Unsatisfactory!!! Now I understand that it's Friday evening and it can get busy, but we ordered at 6:22p and stood until 7:13p! 53 minutes before we got our to go order!!  
The gentleman who was there before us waited just as long if not longer for 2 salads and they forgot his fries and he had to wait some more! 
Our orders two chicken sandwiches & fries were cold!! We watched it come directly from the counter straight into the bag and our food was COLD! How does that happen?!? The girl working the to go orders appeared to be mixing up orders or not including all the items. People kept returning for their missing items which caused longer wait times. This place is a clusterf**k to put it mildly! Before we left my wife gave them a piece of her mind! 
Totally unorganized and inefficient staff! I urge everyone who reads this and was there on 10/28/16 between the hours of 6p-7:30p call the manager and give him/her some heck. 
If they want to remain open they need to get their collective crap together!! Won't be coming back soon...if ever! 
Yelp admin, if you could please update your app to award negative stars I would appreciate it."}
{"text":"It's our go to burger place. I like the menu with chicken, salad, sweet potato fries options. This puts it above 5 Guys for me.  Buy gift cards from Costco to save money.  I like the decor and concept.   I guess the things keeping it from 4 stars are the subtle things like sometimes burgers come before shakes, there is a cleanliness issue. The place just lacks the right energy vibe. Staff always seem confused. Are they supposed to be taking orders? Making shakes? Serving? Cleaning tables? All of the above? None of the above?"}
{"text":"Loooove this place. They have awesome burgers and customer service was awesome. It was my first time ever eating here and I wasn't disappointed at all."}
{"text":"While the food here is good, the service absolutely awful. I placed an order online while we were sitting right outside. The restaurant was empty on a Monday night. Ten minutes after my order I went in and sat on the bench. A couple came in a few minutes later. Ten minutes later they got their food and I was still waiting. Honestly, I almost left without my food but I had already paid online."}
{"text":"I come from a sales background and really impressed by nature of these kids enthusiasm and attentiveness to customers.

Nasir and Dominique to be more specific."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars because of the freakin price. $20 for a basic burger fries and drink. I mean it was alright tasting but why is it expensive? Is it because it's in a prime location and high end hotel? Not sure. But rather go to In-and-Out."}
{"text":"Well management here sucks, called in a to go order 1 hour before hand and the manager Eli apparently forgot to submit my to go order in. I told him I'd pick it up at 7, but come to find out I have to wait another 30 minutes because of his \"forgetfulness\". Terrible management. Didn't even apologize or offer me a free drink. Looks like they've lost customers. Oh and they forgot to put grilled chicken on my salad, found that out the best way possible...at home"}
{"text":"When the place first opened it wasn't very good, but my god this stuff is amazing now. I have seriously considered freebasing the smash sauce.  The food is amazing and orders are fast.  Great family atmosphere too with good choices for little ones.  The Smash Fries are great, but my personal favorite is the fried pickles.  not greay, not soggy, just foodgasmic.

Try the Bluegrass burger, it's amazing.  

If you are a low-carber/WLS patient like me, this is a great joint because you can get your burger lettuce wrapped and it's just as tasty.  

If you're really feeling frisky, the milkshakes are drool worthy.  I'd compare them to the goodness of Chick Fil A's and that's saying something."}
{"text":"Great Food! Amazing Chicken burger!"}
{"text":"While I love Smashburger this particular location has really gone down hill. There were 6 tables waiting to be cleaned, trash on the ground and bathrooms that were not working. This lackluster experience was only compounded by the lack urgency from staff. Will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"The burger here was amazing! I will totally order it again. I had a mushroom and swiss one that blew my mind. My family enjoyed their meal as well. The only thing that was not amazing was the ice tea stand it was really watered down but the food was still totally worth it."}
{"text":"Holy jesus this place is expensive! 

2 burgers, fries and drinks for like $25 bucks?! I'd love to go more often, but not for these prices. Literally one of the most expensive burgers I've ever bought."}
{"text":"Love coming here!  By far the best hamburger.  They use Angus beef better quality!  Those French fries with the truffle oil are the best fries ever!  Staff is very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Well I have to say I enjoyed the Sin City Smash Burger it was a burger dream. The Sin City Burger - Fried egg, apple wood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and the smash sauce on an egg bun. Plus the smash fries are really good as well. But keep in mind the Sin City Burger was on the menu in Arizona for a limited time so you might not see it on the menu but you can still order it. Plus they have a lot of great craft beer there so aways a plus."}
{"text":"It's good but not amazing. It tastes a lot like 5 guys hamburgers... almost as good as fat burger . Great customer service though.

You won't hate yourself , quality is good as is price. But you won't go out of your way to find one. So depending on your location and hunger factor this may be a hamburger for you..."}
{"text":"I couldnt wait to get back to a Smashburger after having my first one in Vegas. I got the Sincity burger in Vegas and they dont offer anything like this that i saw here. :-(
So i deceided to get the Arizona burger and it was ok, if it was my first smashburger i wouldnt be craving it though like i did with the sincity burger. So now i still have to wait for that crave."}
{"text":"We went to the hash house a gogo and it was packed and we only had half hour to eat. 
So on our way to Bears Best we ran into this place and we both were happy we did.

I ordered the Sin City burger without grilled onions and it was the best burger ive had in a long time. Its not a plain round burger. 
The burger has some much flavor and herbs and spices in it that you cant appreciate the fries. I couldnt taste any flavor from the fries because of the burger.

Now open one up in Southern California!!"}
{"text":"Amy who is the \"Shift Lead\" is just plain rude. I came in with a large party and instead of helping the gentlemen upfront she decided not to which made my residents wait for there shakes. They ended up getting there shakes after there food so i asked for water cups so they could actually drink something & she says \" oh i didn't know shakes were hydrating\" like are you kidding me? How rude and ugly of a person can you be? I have elderly people with my who could choke if they don't have something to drink at times."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and delicious food! I have been here several times with my boyfriend and we have yet to be disappointed. I love the grilled chicken avocado club and all of their fries are great. Kourtney has really stood out with her exceptional kindness when taking our orders. Even on their busy days the food comes out quick and is picture quality. The food tastes as beautiful as it looks. Quality has been very consistent with each visit and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the price. The BBQ Bacon Burger was off the chain! Overall GOOD place to eat. No Military Discount :("}
{"text":"I used to come here once a week. It was a day I looked forward to when I would finish class and not have work for the rest of the day. Something about the food is just so classic to me - the sin city, the root beer floats and the fries. It's a bit pricey to some, but I'd rather pay a few extra bucks for the quality."}
{"text":"Wow! In all of the restaurants I've ever eaten at the grossest thing I might have gotten in my food was a hair. While that's pretty gross, what I got today in my burger is both disgusting and perplexing. Right smack underneath my burger patty was the order ticket from smash burger. I guess they thought I wanted a little paper with my burger. I called immediately and they have rectified the situation but it's still extremely concerning that something like this would be on a burger. What's more upsetting is that I started eating it and chewed and swallowed the part of the paper.

We just started eating smash burger again, we were not fans before as we had not so good experiences at some of the other places. Some of our friends said to give smash burger another try so we did recently at this very location, we really enjoyed our burger that time and that's why we came back today. Well we are definitely very disappointed at what happened."}
{"text":"The concept of the place is great and the variety is good but the burger is very dry and very salty"}
{"text":"Oh Smashburger how I loath thee!  I work fairly close to this location and the second I hear someone request Smashburger for lunch I cringe!  Why, you ask?  A lunch hour consist of 60 minutes which is nearly impossible to make at smashburger.  We always order food to go.  They always say there is a 5-7 minute wait which really ends up being AT LEAST 25 minutes.  You stand in a crowded little area waiting for your food with everyone staring at their watches or cell phones grumbling about how this is the last time they are coming here. However; you do get to watch the circus act that is the staff running around like a chicken with their head cut off.   
That place is a revolving door.  There are new people everyday!

This place seems to be poorly designed.  I am a frequent visitor at popular restaurants I can handle the wait.. but to me ... burgers are something I go for when I need food quickly.  

Now on to the food.  I usually order a chicken avocado club.  I cannot handle all the grease on their burgers.  That sandwich typically is good if someone decides to cook the bacon thoroughly.  The fries however.... well, let's just say I just got done cleaning off my desk because of the pools of grease.  Like I get it guys in the kitchen you are busy but man... it's like I ordered a cup of grease easy on the fries...  Needless to say I couldn't eat it.
I prefer Lobby's Burgers or Five Guys over Smashburger just because of the service alone."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly! Burger was ok, kinda on the small side for a \"regular\" burger. Fries were way too salty my fiancé and I couldn't eat it!"}
{"text":"This is what a $7 spinach and goat cheese salad at smash burger looks like. Half a cup of wilted bag spinach with a tomato and one small clump of goat cheese, served with a side of rude service. They also fry all of their veggie options on beef lard, misleading and gross. This chain was decent but will loose market share as better burger joints with healthy options take over. A glorified MCDonalds at best."}
{"text":"My family and I have never been treated so badly in our lives! After a long day of work and sports, we wanted some burgers from a non fast food restaurant. We had been to another Smashburger location in the past and enjoyed it. So we stopped by this location thinking we'd receive the same service. Not even in same hemisphere! Walked in and immediately a young guy nearly ran us over trying to run out to the parking lot. He had a distinct smell of weed which initially didn't concern me until everything that happened next. There was no one at the counter. We heard yelling and slamming of kitchen equipment from the back but nobody was upfront. A few minutes later, a young man with \"manager\" on his name tag emerged quite rattled and coughing. We tried to give him our order nearly half a dozen times, but he couldn't get through it without massive coughing bouts. I finally grabbed a to-go cup and got him some water and asked if he needed help or wanted me to call someone. He just shook his head no violently while chugging down the water. He finally got the order in and we went to get our drinks. I heard some muffled yelling in the back again but didn't think much of it until my daughter motioned me closer to the door to listen. Her jaw was on the floor. Soon enough I understood why. We heard at least 2 guys in the back cussing and screaming about how they were going to spit in our food and \"fu@! them\" and more slamming. I immediately went to the counter and cancelled our order. The \"manager\" asked why which was beyond baffling and I told him I heard everything and I want my money back. He just said sorry a bunch of times. We left and will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time, I'm not from around here so when my aunt said we should go, I went. Service was good and the food was great. The burger tasted fresh and the smash fries stole my heart. I'm probably gonna look for s smash burger in LA by me now."}
{"text":"Just an average burger. Extremely over priced for what you get. Shakes were $5 and tasted like weakly flavored milk. Bathroom was completely unusable and when I advised the staff they did nothing to remedy the problem or lock it up. Glad we tried it but won't feel like I'm missing something . Won't be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Of all the burgers I ate, In n Out was the best burger until I tried Smashburger. The burgers are really flavorful and they have 3 size selections, small, regular and big. The price is reasonable for its burger. The place was clean and the staff were friendly, however the only thing I didn't like so much was the fried pickle, it was really salty and expect the batter would be a little thicker."}
{"text":"We were greeted by mike the assistant manager and Brodie. Both of them were super friendly and really helped us with our order and were very patient. After we ordered we asked for additional things to bring to the table and Brodie really didn't have any problem helping us out. The burgers we ordered tasted great. It's really awesome to eat at a place where people are in a really good mood and incredibly helpful. This is by far my favorite smash burger place."}
{"text":"Good burger and quick service. Had a vanilla shake it was yummy! We use to always go to Chelsea's Kitchen and last two times we had cold food. Smashburger is our new go to stop!"}
{"text":"9/20-our order taken at 6:16 on the receipt & at 6:53 I checked & order wasn't ready-He said there was at least 10 min left or more-After talking with my husband we had to leave to our movie that started at 7:05- so I told him we had to go- I was never offered a refund just given coupons, which didn't even cover what we paid-he was very rude and said \"what do you want me to do give you more or something?\" My husband Was so mad and he's not the arguing kind so He just told me let's go without getting a refund or any more coupons we left SB at 7 & went w/out dinner-there wasn't a clean table inside or outside.1 hr they expected us to wait!Our 1st time & we will never go back! 2 bad because we were excited ... Too bad I had to give them one star"}
{"text":"Another place very near to Thunderbird business school....very very tasty food...I ordered for the original burger and chocolate shake ..Awesome food...Lively atmosphere...great place to hang out..

Food: 4.95 out of 5"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Smashburger. Today they went up even more.  In the past I've enjoyed the Smash Chicken.  Crispy.  Recently I had ordered it and instead of one nice large piece I was given two very small pieces.  I ate it said nothing and went about my day.  Now I'm back and I just mentioned to the person taking my order what happened last time so it might not happen again. Not only did I get a nice big piece but the fellow who took my order wold not charge me for it.  THAT is the kind of service you don't see everywhere today.  Much appreciated and above and beyond.  THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"In my forced gluten-free world, Rehab Burger is 1A, Smashburger is 1B., but only by a nose. Since Smashburger is closer, I get their burgers more."}
{"text":"Store still open but said weren't cooking anything but chicken anymore before it closed"}
{"text":"This was my first Smashburbger experience, so keep that in mind when reading this review. I ordered the Sin City burger and it was great. The shift lead taking my order explained what makes Smashburger different from other burger joints and my food arrived in under three minutes. The only reason why I'm not giving this review four stars is because the burger was so hot that half of it split apart and cane out of the bun upon my first bite, and that because of the extreme heat, the first half of the eating was consumed by me trying to cool off the inside of my mouth. Once the burger cooled off to a more eatable temp, the taste really shined through. The Smash fries were pretty awesome... flavorful in every bite, but again, super hot when they first arrived. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Filth fast food.  Empty glasses and plates at almost every table fork and knife came out dirty as well as the plate the food was in.  Food was good but will not comeback to this place. Didn't bother looking in restrooms"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and it's very good. I like that there's a choice of type of meat for your burger including turkey amongst others. The burgers are amazing! The fries have good flavoring, but they were a little too greasy and thinly cut for me."}
{"text":"The food is smashing . The employees are working hard and keeping the place clean. They have good service too!"}
{"text":"At 1st I really liked smash... I would even get cravings! But now not so much. The last 2 times I went my fries were soggy! ew sick! I dont mind paying $20 for fast food when it tastes good but sheesh.... Get it together! Also the boy who took my order at the  20th and Camelback store was quite rude. I will give them 2 more trys before I cut them off for good. (I still get the smash cravings) hahaha"}
{"text":"Not the best burger in vegas by far, but not the worst either. Friendly staff and clean restaurant. I don't know but to me there fries are really greasy and not fresh kinda like they cook them in bulk and then dip them in hot grease to warm them up...Yuc.. I ordered the club burger with NO ranch and I got some anyway.. I wiped it off the best I could because I don't like complaining and then sending my food back cuz god knows what they might do to it..just not a fan of smash burger I guess, plus you can go write next door and get a much better burger at outback steak house for about ah doller more."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if it were possible.  This has to be by far the worst smashburger location ever.  We live in the neighborhood so we are kind of stuck with it, but the consistency of the food and even worse the consistency of good competent service never fails to live up to the zero stars I would give this place.
I can give many examples, but the most recent that really pushed me over the edge was a 45 minute wait for a side of fried pickles, a side of fries and a milk shake.  yes, I said 45 minutes for 2 side items and a shake.    Most of the time fries are undercooked too."}
{"text":"My friend and I were at the tanning salon when one of the workers brought some Smashburger in. The smell alone made us crave this delicious new place. We started an epic hunt to find it, and when we did, it was well worth it. The food is heavenly and divine, the restaurant is clean and shiny, easy to find, and staff is friendly. My only complaint is that you have to pay for french fries separately!! D:"}
{"text":"I enjoy the restaurant and the food they have to offer, however there is 1 employee (blonde, tall, thin) EVERY time I leave I leave smiling because this man loves his damn job! I get exceptional costumer service every time I have the please to be helped by him. 
I wish more people treated their jobs like he does! Because of him I come back to this location.

I will get his name and edit this post because he deserves the recognition."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service is top knotch! From the moment I walked in to the time I took my food home,  I felt welcomed and taken care of.   Because of their lack of \"value meals\" ordering from their menu is not like your typical burger joint,  and because of that it's pretty easy to get to the $12 mark by just ordering a burger, standard size drink and fries,  so if you're price conscious, do an online search for coupons. 

I ordered the Large Bacon Cheeseburger, The bacon was thick cut, and the patty was at least 1/2 pound of perfectly cooked perfection, and came on fresh kiser style bun,  very yummy.   The bacon burger didn't come with lettuce and tomato,  and being a fan of the full featured burger,  I'll make a mental note to go for a \"create your own\" for next time.   The smash fries were  awesome as well,  thin cut and and seasoned with garlic and what appeared to be a light dusting of parmisian cheese. 

Overall,  a great step up from your typical burger joint,  and I'll be back for more soon."}
{"text":"I was searching for breakfast when I saw that Smashburger did breakfast sandwiches. After consulting the menu, I chose a breakfast burger. A burger, fried egg, bacon and cheese on an egg bun. So delicious! My only complaint was I spent $15. Definitely recommend if you need a quick breakfast!"}
{"text":"The food is above average. I really like their hamburger buns. They are made for egg. The meat here cooked well and flavored nicely. Vanilla shake is excellent. On overall great hamburger joint"}
{"text":"Smash burger has a really good club burger on a wheat bun, that isn't dry! I love it!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I just wasted $7.99 on such a pathetic anorexic burger. I've heard really good things about Smash Burger so I figured I would give it a try, definitely disappointed. The meat was thin, overlooked and poorly seasoned. There was one soggy lettuce leaf draping the burger, I can't believe they get away charging so much for their burger, I'm still trying to figure out what makes Smash Burger so special. I also has to wait in line for about fifteen minutes and then another ten for my food, definitely understaffed."}
{"text":"I've heard that this place is amazing. Not sure why. I went in first time and had an all american with sweet potato fries. Loved the fries! Burger was okay.

A friend had fried pickles, I tried some, and I have to admit that it was salty- must be the batter?

Try it at least once."}
{"text":"Burger was great!  the Chocolate malt is fantastic, the fries were not for me.  Next time I will get the regular fries instead of the smash fries."}
{"text":"Second time trying to smash burger and this around was horrible.i'm just going to blame it on bad timing and location so I will just return city for smash burger over in South Park area. Not well seasoned patty was thin and slightly over cooked."}
{"text":"The second-best burgers in town after The Dispensary. Delicious salads and chili, too!
Don't miss this place. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Great service. Best burger ever -fresh meat, fresh toppings! Staff was personable, acted like true owners, proud, complimentary of menu. Only eaten at 2 Smash burgers in last few months and burgers and staff at both sites were great and consistently best, tasty, true classic burger."}
{"text":"This is bad-burger review night for me, as I crave a big veggie burger, but everything is closed.

I had low opinions of the Habit and their hockey puck veggie burger, and I must sadly report the same of Smashburger.  Just a lump of nothing.  I would rather eat a cardboard container from Burger King than eat another Smashburger veggie burger.  Yuck.  

As others have said, the customer service is fine, but I can't eat customer service, and as a vegetarian I can't eat the servers, either, although I'm sure even their uniforms taste better than the veg burger.  God, I really hated that burger, didn't I?  This is another one of these places where I will simply never go again because it was just so bad and bland.  

Here's a tip to all restauranteurs: don't put a veggie burger on the menu if you really don't give a shit about veggie burgers or if you simply plan to buy a giant box of a thousand Boca burgers at Costco.  I love Boca burgers in a pinch, at home, and only if slathered in my own BBQ sauce, but not in your damn restaurant.  

The only good part about this experience was that they have plenty of parking, and oh, the people who work there are very friendly.  Other than that, yuck."}
{"text":"$4 triple anniversary burger that actually had too much cheese for me. I can't believe I am saying too much cheese, but the velveeta chunk pushed it over for me. Soft bun, browned meat and all the fixins for this crazy time price. 

Clean restaurant. Younger crowd. Canned and bottled beer available. Big selection of types of fries. Salads and chicken dishes available, too. Brewed iced tea. Easy parking. Big restroom."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the  hype is about. I guess my burger standards are very high. The burgers are pretty good, the restaurant was very clean, and the staff was very friendly. The food came out nice and hot delivered to my table and was cooked perfectly. The other bonus is that they serve beer. Other then that, I had a fine experience but will make my rounds to other burger places before coming back again."}
{"text":"Wow. Walked in on Sunday morning just a bit after they opened and took a bit to order as cashier was in back having to assist with the opening, I assume. Obviously the shift from the night before didn't do much of anything. The table I went to was filthy. Had to clean it myself, then started looking around and noticed that nothing was cleaned. All the tables and benches in my sight were dirty with dried blech on them. Went to get ketchup, since my ketchup was missing. Next two tables I went to, the ketchup was out. Cashier was apologetic about ketchup and tables. Seemed a bit busy as it was apparent she was running around trying to get things in order since apparently nothing was completed the night before. Food was good though..."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey, and not the best, but still a very good burger. If you top the burgers with too much, they are a beast to eat. The sweet potato fries are tasty! One thing that bothered me is that they had a label on the condiment counter for the Cholula, but it was spelled CHOLUA. I.Hate.Typos."}
{"text":"This is my first review of Smashburger, even though I frequently visit this location (2-3 times per week).  The food is incredibly fresh and tasty.  I have gluten issues, and am able to get a gluten free bun here, whereas the competition (Five Guys), does not offer the GF bun option. So we now visit Smashburger instead of Five Guys.  I am also able to get several rare items on my burger, which I love (goat cheese, spinach, etc.). The sweet potato fries are the BEST that I have ever had.  The options are great.    The service at this location is usually VERY good-Excellent.  The order usually comes out within 3-5 minutes.  It is pretty fast.  The people that work here are very knowledgeable about their products, and service is their middle name.  Brad is one of the managers and is always making sure everyone is happy with their food and telling us they are happy that we came by.  Joshua is another great employee working here...he works his tail off! I think I see him every time I go in.  He is definitely a worker - and not lazy at all!  That is rare these days. Those are the only two I have interacted with regularly on my visits, that I can remember.  I do remember Kamryn, who took our order once, and was very polite and friendly.  There have been a couple of slip ups on the times I have visited, where they missed the goat cheese and did blue cheese, instead, or forgot my fries.  One time I visited recently, and they goofed up my order a couple of times, so Brad, the manager comped my entire meal.  He didn't have to do that, and I did not ask for that, nor was I upset, but nonetheless, it was done.  The place was busy, but he took the time to search for my order on the computer to comp my meal, so he could make it right.  That is my kind of place.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"I go by this place almost every week. Tonight was my first time stepping inside.

The layout confused me at first, I wanted to walk straight ahead after entering the doors. Then my friend waived me over to the left side where the menu was on the wall. The counter where you order is near that.

I like the simplicity of the menu. Either pick a burger that they've created or make up your own burger with different options/toppings. What I did not really like was that the server at the counter did not know what \"gluten-free\" meant. He had a very \"wtf??\" look on him. He went in the back to talk with the cook, then came back and brought out the employee handbook. We then flipped through it to find their allergen section. 

Here's what I can remember from the handbook:
* Angus burgers are okay when ordered without the bun and without \"fried toppings\" like the haystack onions
* You might have issues with cross-contamination as everything is cooked on the same grill
* Fries are not okay and there's obvious cross-contamination in the fryer
* Premium and malt milkshakes are not okay (obvious reasons)

We were in a dangerous mood, so we stayed and ordered. My gluten-free friend ordered a Sin City burger, sans onions, sans bun. I got the \"Rebel Special\" all-American burger, sans bun. I also added an egg on top.

The burgers came out on a plate. I was expecting it to be wrapped in lettuce, so it would be more burger-like, but it was like an open-faced sandwich -- or rather, a hamburger steak with toppings. We were given forks and knives to eat it with. Should have taken a pic, but we were starving.

My \"burger\" was decent. It had cheese, pickles, raw red onions, and some ketchup/mustard. The egg went really well with the burger. My only gripe was that the burger meat itself was a tad over-seasoned. Not sure how my friend's burger was, but he scarfed it down quick.

The cost for all this was about $20 (including drinks and a regular shake). Worth it? I don't know. But it was nice to have a \"gourmet\" burger for once."}
{"text":"Pretty inconsistent service and quality of food. I don't think I will be having another smashburger again. I do love their fries but I can find plenty of burger joints that have quality burgers & fries. 
When I ordered the sin city I repeated twice please leave off the grilled onions. I still got grilled onions that soaked my bun with that onion juice taste. I also noticed their routine of bussing tables consists of picking up the empty burger & fry baskets and that's it. I saw 5 tables leave while I dined and not one table or anything on it got wiped with a clean cloth. The napkins were nearly empty on almost all of the tables. If they pay such little attention to front of the house then why would they pay attention to the back? What I'm saying is I'm afraid of what inconsistencies are going on in the kitchen. If you want a burger, go somewhere cleaner with better quality."}
{"text":"Three stars because of where we sat. The floor was not swept and there were no silverware in the utensil container. Also, they brought over the wrong order. You suppose to know the order by the number they give you.

My wife ordered the Arizona burger without the tomatoes. Even heard the cashier tell the cooks \"no tomatoes on the Arizona burger!\". I had my usual, Truffle Mushroom Burger which was very tasty and the bun was soft and the bottom not soaked with the juices from the burger.

Had a coupon for BOGO free which was going to expire the next day."}
{"text":"Awesome service!  Raul was great!  We always enjoy smashburger. Clean facility and great service."}
{"text":"Don't order to-go from this restaurant. Unless you want to receive half the portion and trash for food. We ordered two salads, sweet potato fries and onion shoe strings to go. First off the salads mayyybeee had a half cup of greens. Apparently it's appropriate to put hot chicken and hot eggs on top of a cold salad?!?! By the time the salad got home (I live 3 minutes away) the lettuce was wilted hot and resembled cooked spinach. But I was hungry so I started to eat it. Then I pulled out the onion shoe strings and my face turned red with anger. The cup that they were in was LITERALLY half full and the shoe strings were sitting in a puddle of grease!!!! I must repeat...a puddle of grease!!!! See the below picture. I wish I would have taken a picture of the salad before I started eating it. Moral of the story?!? I paid $23 to still be hungry and have a stomach ache. Awesome."}
{"text":"This Smashburger is inside Caesars Palace.  While the food was good... I really like Smashburger and Smash Fries... it was SO overpriced simply for being on the casino floor?  I also did not think the combo I got here was up to the norm I usually expect from Smashburger and other locations I have been to.  I will pass on the price alone if I am every hungry for a quick bite at Caesars again."}
{"text":"Real greasy burgers and pools of grease at the bottom of the fry container. I do have a guilty passion for their BBQ, haystack onion, bacon burger. Their staff is decent and can't say I've had a bad experience. They'd get a higher rating if they'd at least try to do something about the grease, but it seems that they try to make it horribly greasy and add more grease on top."}
{"text":"We love their food here but it's a little scary when you look around and see how dirty the restaurant is, always. It appears the only thing they wipe down are tabletops.  I wish they would clean once in awhile"}
{"text":"I blame a Yelp Elite event for my new obsession with this place.  I'd never been til Yelp had us there and I was hooked.  Dammit.

The burgers are fresh and not overly greasy, but also not overly dry. They aren't healthy by any means. However they do offer chicken and salads as well. 

For me I love the class Smashburger (with no ketchup, which is Satan's condiment).  The Smash Fries are to do for.  They are 'classy' fries, if you will.  Thin cut and cooked so that they hold their shape and aren't soggy.  Tossed with Olive oil, rosemary and a bit of garlic they are far beyond your average fries at  burger joints.

I just yesterday got the Chocolate Oreo shake and it was heaven. Hand made using Haagen Daas, you can't go wrong. 

I don't frequent here often, because that's just asking for trouble; but it is my go to hangover place.  ;) After a long staycation weekend at the Biltmore, this was beckoning me.  It did the job!"}
{"text":"I THOUGHT I found the perfect burger at a certain chain that has a certain number in it. ;)  That is, until I found this place.  That OTHER place has gross fries but fantastic burgers, this place has fantastic fries and burgers.  

I hate soggy fries. Hate 'em. These were crispier than their competition.  The burgers are juicy and oh so flavorful.  I also hate soggy bacon,but this place got it right. My bacon on the burger was crispy and perfect.  You can't go wrong witht he bacon cheeseburger.  

My particular location I went to was in the mess that is ASU campus.  Yowzas.  However, kudos to the staff for dealing with annoying college kids.  Would I come to this location again?  Hell no, because I teach annoying college kids and try to avoid them outside of work. ;)  But I was in the location and had a craving.  Will I be going to a different location?  Hell yeah!"}
{"text":"The burger was amazing and the garlic fries are fantastic. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a great burger and fries."}
{"text":"First timer! Ordered the Veggie Avocado Ranch Burger with Veggie Frites. The veggie patty quality was ooook. Tasted like smashed black bean mush and was way too large for the burger's buns - looked like a flattened meat pancake, lol! The Veggie Frites were nothing special either, just a basket of carrots and green beans oiled and baked. However, I'm always grateful for the healthy/veggie options and Smash Burger has plenty of that.

My boyfriend ordered the Sin City burger (obviously a Vegas exclusive) and Smash Fries and said the burger was enjoyable, and fries were alright (thin and peppery)

I wasn't impressed with Smash Burger's food quality and wouldn't see myself coming back here for a burger fix. To get a gist of my burger taste buds, my top spots in Vegas are 1) In N Out 2) Shake Shack and 3) Bachi Burger"}
{"text":"Pssst, this location has been closed. Drove to the location today and area where Smashburger was initially located is vacant and sign has been removed. (Reported to Yelp)"}
{"text":"Oh yea. This place is awesome. I always get free sides here because I always do the survey on the receipt. I have never had a problem with any of my food being cooked wrong, my order has always been put in right, and I have always left satisfied.

The food is delicious. It really is. My favorite burger is the sin city...it's an off menu item, but make sure you ask for it. It has eggs, bacon, cheese, and fried onions."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast type of gal but their egg & cheese sandwich was so good!!! Oh, and the o j. seriously the best I've tasted :)"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers , highly recommend the Arizona burger for the spicy lovers. The avocado club is a personal favorite."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great. It was cold, bland, and there was a small rock in one of my fried pickles. Yes a small rock. It must have been in the batter or stuck to the pickle. After I bit into the fried pickle I felt a hard object in my mouth after blighting down and it hurt a tooth. So I spit out the pickle and there was the rock in it. I couldn't believe my eyes as I have never would have expected to see a rock in my food. Unfortunately it made a piece of my molar break off. Not really happy right now."}
{"text":"I went there today and It was fantastic.  The staff  is fantastic.  Delmario is VERY,VERY personable.  It made it a great time and I will be back and not I realize why people brag about this so much.  This was fantastic."}
{"text":"Somehow I just tried my first Smashburger this week. Overall, a pretty solid burger and a solid option if you are in the area of the outlets. 

My coworkers and I ordered takeout to bring back to the office. We placed the order online, but my coworker stil waited a few minutes for the order. The staff told him that online orders aren't received by the restaurant until 10 minutes before pick-up time. Bad news...this means you'll wait even if ordering ahead of time. Good news....the food was freshly prepared and still hot when it arrived back at the office.

Pretty much all of us ordered the Sin City Burger and Smash Fries. The Sin City Burger had a nice sized beef patty, American cheese, egg, crispy bacon, grilled onions, and smash sauce. It was a great combination of ingredients and tasted great. The burger had plenty of the mentioned ingredients, but was still fairly easy to eat. I hate when a burger is overloaded to the point that you end up eating each ingredient separately. The Smash Fries had a nice herb flavor and were very crispy."}
{"text":"Maybe it is Sunday night but 15 minute  wait to order   They are out of the good beer, out of lemons for tea, out of napkins and it is obvious the manager is away."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Very clean interior.  Wonderful youthful workers always smiling.  They seem to enjoy having a job."}
{"text":"While in line for in and out my friend asked me if I've ever tried smashburger. I hadn't so I looked at the menu online. Being hungry I just agreed cause the line at in and out was wrapped around the building. When we pulled up to Smash there wasn't a soul in sight. That should have been a sign of something. Dining room was clean and we were greeted promptly and told they would be right with us. There were only 3 tables occupied in the entire building but the staff was flustered and in panic mode trying to run food, answer the phone, and god knows what else. FINALLY we were asked to place out order. Staff was knowledgeable on the menu and offered suggestions and upsells. I ordered a burger for my dog plain but was told about the \"Fido\" burger (not on the menu) was told it was a plain burger with no seasoning for $2.00. So I got 2. My friend knew that would cause jealousy at the house so we ordered 3 more for the other pups at home. We each got the sin city burger, hers with no egg. After a SUPER long wait we got our greese soaked paper bags.......... (like REALLY soaked). Got back to the house and began eating. My burger was ok...... nothing remarkable (Double Double animal style is FAR BETTER) Fries were ok but I got the Olive oil and rosemary ones....... the cup they came in had at least 1/4 cup of I guess a mixture of fry greese and olive oil which made me have to throw most of them away. My friends burger had a big ol fried egg on it so she was bummed out. When it came time to dish out the \"Fido burgers\" I saw that it was just 5 beef patties in a salad bowl......... that's not what was described. Anyways I guess the lesson is to read the reviews and go where the line is, cause the food and service is probably worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger!  The people who work there are friendly and always make my friends and me feel welcome.  Their burgers and salads and fries are yummy.  I have tried many of their menu items and liked all of them.  Two burgers are my very favorite burgers ever!  One comes with bacon, avocado, tomato, and lettuce-- and I sometimes get it protein-style, on lettuce without a bun.  The barbecue, bacon, haystack onions, etc. with a biggie burger on an egg bun is a special treat!  Sometimes I will get these burgers with smash grilled  chicken -- also delicious!  And the salads are equally tasty.  The greens are always fresh, and there are many combo choices.  It is my favorite place to get lunch or dinner, either to eat there or to take home.  Tony is the General Manager and his standard is to make everyone feel welcomed and happy to be at Smashburger."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because everything I ate here was free, BUT that's not really a good reason to put this in a 4 star category. This is really on par with In and Out but with slightly better service. By better service, I mean they bring food to your table with a smile.

Just think Johnny Rockets without the singing and cheesiness. At this point, just come to my table and take my order already. I'm ultra selective in my caloric contents per day so to put that pressure on me while people behind are waiting to order is just plain annoying. I'll just end up ordering everything on my burger and it'll come out tasting like compost, extra salty! 

As for the milkshake, Johnny Rockets has the best milkshake on earth. The remaining is served in a frosty metal cup that is begging to be scooped with your tongue. Oh wait I'm suppose to be reviewing Smashburger.... enough said."}
{"text":"A good burger, but too expensive!  Great milkshakes too and decent fries, but for the same price-you can dine in at nearby Islands Restaurant for the same quality of food."}
{"text":"Honestly, everyone has their preference for the perfect burgers, but for me, Smashburger is pretty close.  The sad thing for me is that the closest ones to me are 1:30 flight or 2:30 drive....  On to the burgers!

I have had the Las Vegas special and the BBQ Bacon burgers.  Both are amazing.  The Vegas burger was nice a juicy, a little salty, but the sweetness of the onions, and richness of the oozy fried egg added a a great balance... all atop the amazing egg bun that absorbed all of the flavors and acted as the perfect mop to clean up anything that well on my burger wrapper.  The BBQ Bacon was again juicy, a little salty but the bbq sauce and crispy onions and the bacon alllllll made it so damn good.  And again, egg bun, you tasty tasty bun you, absorbed all of the juice and flavors and sauce into your soft eggy goodness.

If you get a chance when you are in Vegas go to smashburger! Way worth the drive or cab ride (or hike if you are that desperate)."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving milkshakes so I initially went to Johnny rockets but found out they were closed for business. Came here for the first time. They've hot Haagen daz IC. Got a pb & j and strawberry one. I asked for them to be thick. Girl said they would be thick. Got them and they weren't thick at all. Big disappointment. I'd rather spend my money on Sonic shakes where they're thicker and come in all sorts of flavors like PB and bacon! 

Also got the veggies frites which are carrot sticks and green beans flashed fried. Maybe it's bc I got them to-go but all they were were limpy vegetables. I'm pretty sure if I had them there they'd still be pitiful. Flash fried would still be crispy. Granted I didn't have their burgers but the place was still a let down food-wise."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great selection, of burgers and fries. Sign up for their special offers."}
{"text":"The most disappointing aspect of the food was the lack of favor. Fries are supposed to be: oh so bad for you, but taste so good. No such luck here. Not greasy, not cold; just flavorless and unappetizing. Burgers are supposed to be juicy. At a celebrated burger joint, the juices should run down your fingers and stain your shirt. This place is very laundry friendly. They are required to cook their burgers to at least medium-well. Well past the edible point. The burgers are a dry hockey puck. The ultimate conclusion is its more expensive than an Applebee's but poorer quality or taste than a McDonalds. Save your money, the ambiance can't make up 4 the food...."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries...not the speediest of service and drive through has been removed."}
{"text":"Love it!

We did Take-Out via phone (they don't have online ordering yet) and it was ready in 7-10 minutes, just enough time to drive over there.

You can create your own burgers with any number of topping - they even have different Cheeses and Buns to choose from. The Spicy Chipotle Mayo is to die for!

Expect to pay around $7 for a burger and fries. Compared to Five Guys - their portion for fries are very small. But do I REALLY need a large bagful of fries? Probably not, so it's fine. Smashburger's burger pattys actually seem much bigger to me compared to Five Guys. So it evens itself out.

If you want a great burger - go to Smashburger."}
{"text":"Great Cobb salad!!  Love the over easy kind of egg on top. 

Tina was such a delight, she even remembered me and my salad order from the previous day. 

Great place when you don't want to add the Vegas weight and get some veggies in for the day.  Thanks Smashburger!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love eating here! We always make a point to put this on our \"places to eat\" last when we visit Vegas. Smashburger makes me happy :)"}
{"text":"Parking here is a bit of a challenge but that's not really the reason for the low review. 
The menu is a bit confusing. Not because I'm easily confused (although that may have some part in it) but because I was there with three other people and everyone just ordered the #1 combo since they didn't want to take the time to decode the menu. 
This place didn't seem very clean either. We walked in pretty early for lunch and I could tell we were the first ones to sit down in an area and the tables were still dirty. I'm sure they weren't cleaned from the day before and this made me feel a little uncomfortable about the sanitation standards in the kitchen. After all, if they didn't take time to brush their teeth, it's highly unlikely they took a shower. 
Good news is the fries were a pretty tasty option. Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of the burger meat. I don't think running beef through a tenderizer is a substitute for using good quality product. For similar money I would just go to Five Guys. They seem to the fast but gourmet market on track. 
The quality does not match the concept. The place needs to step up the cleanliness and the staff was easily forgettable. I'm sorry Smash, but you have some work to do."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in here for lunch. I had never been here before. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with smash fries. After I received my order I realize there is no lettuce or tomato on the burger. I guess I have to ask for it. Anyway , it was a pretty good burger. The fries were good but quite a bit greasy. The bathroom needed to be cleaned because there was paper all over the floor. The service was nice and friendly. I might try them again someday."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Burger joint in Vegas the food is really great and fairly priced . The employees are very helpful and attentive ... the dinning area and kitchen are very clean . I would defently eat there again and again ."}
{"text":"Last couple of visits here have been terrible from the wait to order my food to the bathroom being dirty if it even works. Today I was in line for at least 15 min and then people that ordered their food after us got theirs first. No sense of urgency with the employees here. 
The tables don't even look like they've been wiped down. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"FINALLY I made it to @smashburgerlv and boy was I glad I did!!!

GREAT Burgers!! Excellent selection of Sides & Fantastic Shakes!!!

1st time out I had to try the Mushroom+Swiss Burger which was OVER the TOP good, 2nd time I had to go for the BAJA Burger which was great as well.

The burgers remind me alot of Fuddruckers with a great selection of fresh toppings but the sides are unique and quite incredible especially the pickle chips and veggie frites.

BEEFY CHILI IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!

Since this location is right across the street from the Village Square Cinemas its a good spot to fill up before seeing a movie instead of paying $12 for a popcorn & soda :) 

Prices are fair for a sit-down burger joint and service is SUPER-Friendly"}
{"text":"HOLY SCCHMOKES!!! Now this is a burger. Let me explain.. I am not a HUGE meat eater, as I usually another my burger in cheese and mustard etc because the beef taste I don't particularly care for. My friend promised me it was delicious. To be honest, when I received it - the patty looked pretty small but it is literally the best tasting and most flavorful patty I have ever EVER had. A must if you're close by. Also not too heavy..."}
{"text":"If you've read any of my reviews, you know that I love me some Smashburger.  Everything from the regular smashburger to the smash fries to the Haagen Dazs milk shakes.

So, during my Tempe/Phoenix visit, I had to stop by a Smashburger to try the regional burger, the Arizona Smashburger.  I'm so pleased that the creators of Smashburger ran with the idea of a regional burger; that means I can try new burgers in new states.  (Okay, so I still have yet to try the Colorado burger, but I'm working on it!)  And the AZ burger was definitely a taste bud pleaser:  kaiser-type bun, guacamole, Pepperjack cheese, chipotle sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and jalapeños.  So freaken' tasty!  I wish I could get this burger more often.

Haven't tried Smashburger yet?  Get off your bum and get moving to your nearest location because you'll be hooked on these delicious burgers in no time."}
{"text":"Our lovely friends brought my BF and I to this spot last night. I read the yelp reviews before committing, but am so glad I ate here!  We ordered 2 Sin City burgers, the sweet potato smash fries, fried pickles, french fries and onion strings, chocolate milk shake. 

My BF and I loved the burger!!!  It's pretty salty, but if you can get past that, it's one of the best burgers you'll ever eat. The meat leaks of juice and flavor; the egg is perfect.  Everything about it is mouth-watering greatness.

Stay away from the pickles - major fail. 

Milk shake - the bomb. Made of Haagan Daz ice cream!

We ate some of our friend's smash fries which were tasty.

If this place was closer to the strip, I can guarantee that it'd make buco-bucks."}
{"text":"Good burger for the price, especially the mushroom swiss burger. Smash fries are very good and stay crispy till the end. We came around 3:00 p.m so there wasn't much of a wait and the service was decent.  Will definitely be back whenever I want a burger and don't want to pay Bachi burger prices. Just hope they stay consistent."}
{"text":"A little disappointed today. Was totally looking forward to my burger and bummed to find out that they had forgotten to put the blue cheese that I had paid extra for on it. Not even a speckle of moldy cheese after paying damn near $17 for a burger, fries, and soft drink. Next time I'll hit In n Out right next door and pay about a third of the price for a meal that never disappoints."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking. \"It's a chain, all chain restaurants are the same!\" Not so. This Smash Burger is the best in town. They cook it right every time. Been there about a dozen times. The manager, the black dude with the dreads, really cares about your experience. You can tell he likes his job. Other SB's just don't have it going on like this one. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Consistently good service and food regardless of location in my experience.
Sin City burger is my go-to with smash fries. 
This location is small-ish, but good."}
{"text":"Great Better Burger Experience. 

Stopped by Smashburger today for the first time. The manager, Greg, was very helpful and showed me the highlights of the menu. I decided on the classic, just to see how they compare to other better burger joints standard offerings. After a very short wait I was treated to a tasty fresh bun, the meat is very satisfying and all my veggies were cold and crisp. Fries were good , lightly fried showstings, I will try smashfries next time. I also really liked the pickle-mayo-mustard sauce, That was the biggest surprise. I will be back to Smashburger."}
{"text":"It really is just an average burger and if you get the large size the bun is to small. But every once in awhile it is nice to have something different and the smash fries are outstanding. I also love the unsweetened ice tea, which is near impossible to get in Calgary. Definitely on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Been waiting to try out Smashburger since it opened it's doors several weeks ago.  Wanted to let things die down a little bit since the kids would be accompanying us and they don't do long line ups very well.

Finally a Friday night with no dinner plans except to decide where are we eating out.  Hubs mentioned a co-worker had eaten at Smashburger for lunch and raved about it.  Sold.  We had the kids grab some activity books to keep themselves busy should there be a line up and off we went.

We arrived at Smashburger and I almost fell off my seat.  No line up.  In fact 3 people ahead of us and plenty of seating  Yahooo, score!!

The menu was extensive and I loved the vegetarian, chicken and 'make your own' options.  Hubs decided on a beef burger, I had a buffalo chicken burger and the kids had chicken fingers & grilled cheese (lol).  We also ordered a side of the smashfries and fried pickles...PLUS beer.  Liked being able to order a cold beer with our burgers!

My buffalo chicken burger was ooey, gooey and all things delicious.  Hubs loved his beef burger and the smashfries were smashing!!  I was the only one who liked the fried pickles, but hey that meant more for me.

We didn't find the sides greasy, in fact everything was very tasty.  Can't wait to have another Smashburger!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers! Be aware the Maryland location (near UNLV) has a different menu...one that included Truffle parmesan fries that this location sadly does not offer. 
Meat is well cooked with all the best accompaniments...cheese, lettuce, pickles, onions, all on a soft egg bun.
The fries are a bit on the stingy side yet I do love crispy shoestring fries...just need the portion to fall in line with \"fat American\" standards, lol.
The onion haystacks are also good and crisp with a nice seasoning, very similar to Outback (which is located next door).
Prices are slightly higher for a fast food joint, but good quality food.
If you're going to binge, this is a good place to do it :)"}
{"text":"Good Food, but Disgusting Environment. My family and I went to Smashburger last night looking forward to a nice meal. Almost every table had dirty dishes and one table had a tub with dirty dishes. I had to clear a table so we could sit down and I cleaned the table with soap and water. The paper towel was black. It was filthy! As we were served we were given paper bowls and were told they ran out of clean bowls for salad. I asked the manager if they were short staffed and he claimed the system was down so they ran behind. None of us bought this extremely lame excuse. He still found time to run out to his car and have a smoke. We have always loved this restaurant and hope the owners fix this health hazard. Perhaps new managers and training on cleaning techniques. The food was still good, but the visit disappointing."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of Sahara and Fort Apache. Parking  shouldn't be an issue as there is plenty. Busy during lunch hours. 

Ok, now this joint has some pretty good food. 

I love the salads here, especially the chicken Cobb salad! The Cobb includes Spring Salad Mix, Diced Yellow Onions, Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Diced Tomatoes, a Fried Egg, blue cheese crumbles, bacon, and ranch dressing. - Delish, no complaints. 

I also come here whenever I have a hankering for fried pickles. Now these are a really good unusual treat. - I love them. 

Since I can't eat beef I can't vouch for the burgers, however the chicken burger is great. I ordered an Avocado Club that consists of Multigrain Bread, 
Breaded Chicken Breast, bacon, Mayonnaise, Leaf Lettuce, Tomato Slices, avocado Slices, and 
Ranch Dressing. -Scrumptious to the last bite. 

The place is always clean and has upbeat employees."}
{"text":"I love this place. I mainly go for their fried pickles a that always come out so good. I've been here several times and all the food is fantastic. Anyone I take never complains about the service or food."}
{"text":"actually they are 3.5 stars (.5 star subtracted because they have coke products) but rounded up because you can get a cold beer. usually order the truffle mushroom swiss on a multigrain bun and alternate between burger and chicken. never disappointed by the food. service has always been friendly and efficient, place clean and usually not overly loud. good place to relax, grab a burger and a beer."}
{"text":"This place is great! The burgers have a unique flavor and they are a little on the greasy side but that's just the style. The customer service is great; the staff is friendly and attentive. It's nice to have someone stop by your table to make sure you're enjoying the food even though it's only a burger joint. They also serve alcohol if you're into burgers and beer."}
{"text":"I've been interested in trying this place for a while but the pricey reputation kept me away.  Finally I gave it a try.

What you get for $11.  A drink, a 5oz burger, and a fries.  Worth it?  Of course not.

Burger is okay, not great but not bad.  In n Out level?  No.  As good as Lobby's up the street?  Hell no.  The 5oz burger for $6 is almost insulting.  The bun is much too large for the amount of meat, the burger almost gets lost in there.  It is called a burger, please make it the main ingredient.  I got the Arizona burger and everything on it was good, but due to the small burger it kind of overwhelmed it.    

I got the Smash fries which have rosemary and olive oil.  They were not good at all.  Very very greasy.  Not sure why you add oil back on to something that was just fried in oil.  Maybe the regular fries aren't as oily.

This is in the same category as Habit Burger.  Worth trying once, completely overpriced, very confused at how they grew beyond one location.  

The friendly staff is the best part of the place but I can spend $5 at In n out for better fries, and a better burger all while sitting in my car.  Why pay double for something not as good?  Exactly."}
{"text":"Very good for barely more than most drive through joints. Service is always good and atmosphere is friendly."}
{"text":"Smashburger isn't bad. It's definitely quality for a fast food chain. But much like 5 Guys, Fatburger, and any of the other nondrive-thru burger joints, Smashburger just doesn't justify it's higher price tag (although this one isn't excessively expensive). 

I had the 1/3 pound classic Smashburger and sweet potato smashfries. The burger patty itself was pretty good, not greasy at all. The egg bun is awesome. The special sauce is lame. I'm very sadden to say that Smashburger is the only place that's ever served me bad sweet potato fries. The portion is pretty small, the fries didn't stay warm for very long, and putting rosemary (an herb I generally enjoy) on them was awful. 

The place is clean and the employees are very friendly. I think Smashburger puts a little too much effort into trying to look like its something better than it really is. I agree with the reviewer who said \"good food costs.\" However, I paid a little more than $7.00 for a burger and fries. Not bad, but there's so many options in the ASU/Mill Avenue area (where for just a few more dollars I can have better food), that I think I'm going to have to pass on Smashburger next time."}
{"text":"Walked inside not very busy which was nice cuz I was hungry. Order buffalo chicken sandwich, so good fries where fresh and hot. Got to sit with my wife and have a quiet dinner in a fast food restaurant. Crazy but true"}
{"text":"Burgers are good, nothing exciting. Chicken sandwiches were a tad dry but the flavor was good on the fried & grilled sandwiches. The whole family agreed the fries aren't  the best since they were cold when we got them. The place will do in a pinch but so will the other burger joints, save your $$ and hit Wendy's - it's the same burger just square. The best thing to come from smash burgers is their shakes, awesome shakes!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Smashburger.  

So for a chain, i was surprised to see a Carolina Chili burger on the menu on a pretzel roll yet.  They had me at Pretzel roll!  The slaw on the burger is made with Duke's Mayonnaise which is another southern favorite.

The burger was great but a little salty, the pretzel roll did not disappoint.  It just fell apart to easy.  But overall with a little mustard added, this was a good choice.  I also ordered fries.  They were forgettable.  About the same texture as McDonald's fries but not nearly as good.  

Service was good here.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  I might have to give them another try.  But with so many burger joints in town, it is going to be difficult to get back here."}
{"text":"Smashburger is a pretty standard burger joint, with some highlights.

I created my own burger - a quarter pounder with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, grilled onions, and jalepenos - and it ended up being a solid burger.  The meat was tasty, and the buns were nice and lightly browned.

I also had the rosemary tossed fries, which were the highlight of the meal, in my opinion.  They had a crispy exterior and a soft center - the way good fries ought to be.  And I enjoyed the flavor of the rosemary with it.  

I've definitely had better burgers, but I'd come back to smashburger without having to think too hard about it."}
{"text":"Come on one piece of lettuce and a tiny piece of flat chicken.  Not good. I asked for a chicken sandwich. Does this look good to anyone?   Nope 
This place needs to get it together. The manager needs to update the cooking staff about how to make a meal."}
{"text":"I was thinking the poor experience was due to first night or weekend jitters, while they were working the kinks out.  Unfortunately, when I checked the previous reviews I see that they have been open a couple weeks now.  

Was there a problem with the food?  Oh, not particularly, but we didn't get our food for 20+ minutes and it was clear that the fries had been sitting out for a little while .  I guess it was cool that they gave us a heads up when we were ordering that it was taking awhile, but this was ridiculous, considering it was not that crowded (I've seen longer lines at the Camelback location with 1/2 the wait time for the food).  Additionally, we saw at least one party who went to complain about the wait time be told that their order had been mistakenly given to someone else!  

So while the food was fine...at this point in time, service is pretty bad.  Hopefully time will help solve the problem, but I doubt I'll ever see the inside of this Smashburger again."}
{"text":"Always great for a burger fix. The Smashburger menu is limited, but grow the hair on your chest and customize it. Super Bonus, they have local beer!"}
{"text":"Smashburgers sounds special doesn't it - NOT!  My burger-loving buddy was looking forward to a special upscale burger.  The only thing upscale was the price - $6.99.  

My buddy ordered a Chicago burger with lettuce, tomatoes and fried onion strips.  It was a 1/2 lb burger, the only other offering being a 1 lb burger.  BTW who wants or needs that much meat?  The bun was not big enough for the huge burger and was greasy on the top.  Afterwards he said he would have been happy with a Whopper at Burger King.

I had the Chicago hot dog which was just okay.  Again the bun was barely big enough for the dog.  Haystack fried onions on the side were tasty but greasy.  

Soft drinks come in a one size cup, making a couple of refills necessary.  Cost was $20 for both of us, overpriced I think.  

For a fast-food restaurant it was kind of dark, not much lighting. A greasy, unhealthy meal. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Smashburger a total of three times. Two of them happened to be at this particular location on Maryland Parkway right next to the UNLV campus. My experiences have been \"okay\" but more like... hey, I've had better burgers than this experiences. Therefore the 2-star rating must be awarded, especially after the visit I had last night after work.

All day I was looking forward to trying out the Baja Burger. I wanted something spicy, something meaty, something satisfying. I figured - this would be it! I was wrong. The burger was actually quite bland, unless I happened to be biting into a jalapeno. There was only a couple times I said, \"Hey, that's spicy\" and even less times I thought \"This burger is totally worth the price I paid for it\". 

I suppose Smash-fans are lovers of all the toppings you can apply to burgers here. Perhaps the different sides you can pair with your burger as well. But to me - it's just not worth the price tag.

Baja Burger - 5.99
Smash Fries - 1.99
Coke - 1.89
Total - $11+

Note that Smashburger does NOT make combos. You must order these things separate. Almost 12 bucks for a burger combo? No thanks. I'll go to a sit down restaurant, pay that much and then leave a bit more for a tip. That would be better than this.

Overall the food was NOT BAD. The burger's bun was actually the most enjoyable thing I had. The Smash fries were not what I expected. Yes, I tasted the rosemary, but not so much the garlic. Plus my fries were teeny tiny fries! Like, I had gotten the bottom of the entire batch! I just cannot say I was satisfied and I can say I probably would have been more satisfied if I had just gone to Inn N Out next door.  

3 strikes. Sorry Smashburger, you're outta my rotation."}
{"text":"First time trying smash burger and I found it disgusting. The burger was extremely salty and the poutine was cold. Nothing special about this place. I had much higher expectations and would have gone to another burger place instead. I'm leaving here with a headache and I feel like throwing up."}
{"text":"Very nice and attentive staff but the food isn't great and it gets real pricey fast. 

Food came quickly. Burger was extremely greasy and the fries were unremarkable - basic frozen fries. No flavor. 

I'd grab a burger here in a pinch but not my first, second or third choice. There  are better local options."}
{"text":"I has my first smash burger ever.   Candice was so sweet and helpful.  The burger was great.   Fries were hot.   Very good for airport food"}
{"text":"I've ate here 3 times now.

Something that has really stood out to me during those 3 times is their lack of detail with clearing the tables.

Every time I have to walk around the dining room aimlessly looking for a table that doesn't have tons of crumbs all over it.  

Please, Smashburger in Cold Springs, wipe your tables clean!!

P.S.
Food has been pretty good."}
{"text":"Nice try but smash did not make the list.. I was stoked from the pictures but I left disappointed.. 

I always look inside my burger and if it's not oozing with cheese or overflowing with toppings, then it ain't a burger..

I ordered the mushroom swiss burger with smash fries and sweet potato fries. The burger had 8 pieces of mushrooms, the meat was dry, the smash fries tasted good in the chili, and the sweet potato fries were not so sweet."}
{"text":"I love burgers and when Smashburger opened, I just had to try it....and I really regret that choice. It was the most digusting greasy burger I've ever had in my life and I will be sure to never return. I'll take Five Guys over Smashburger any day of the week."}
{"text":"OMG- This was the best burger I have had forever- for the price. And the Smashfries were wonderful . It beats 5 Guys by a mile. 
Smashburgers buns are out of this world. I had the mushroom Swiss 1/3 lb and it was so fresh and juicy. I could eat one every day so I am glad they are not close to my work or home. Bravo to Smashburger.

{"text":"This was my 3rd and final try for this place.  The other two locations in AZ have always been very delicious but this one can't seem to get its head out of its butt.  Last 2 trips, unprofessional staff, everyone standing at the back counter being loud and obnoxious forgetting they were there to work.  2nd time I went the girl at the register was down right snotty with way too big of an attitude, like she was too good to be there and having to serve paying customers was beneath her.  Both times food was cold and burgers done past well done, inedible.  This time I told the kid at the register, after he ignored myself and 2 other customers for a couple mins while standing at the back counter being loud with the other kids, that I wanted my burger medium rare.  He said the only way they can make them is well done???  I told him the last two times I was there I had to throw my burgers away because they were so well done they were beyond dry.  He said because they pre make them they are unable to cook them any other way and for another reason he couldn't remember.  Then why can I get it this way at the other locations? This is the only one they won't make it to the customers specifications.  It seriously is like they are back under a heat lamp.  So I got home with my burger and sure enough, cold and beyond well done and tossed.  Will never waste my money at this location again, which makes me sad because I was really excited when they opened one so close to my house.  Owners of this location need to start reading these reviews and make some changes.  Don't waste your money people, McDonald's is better than this place."}
{"text":"They're very fast here, food is fresh! I recommend getting the \"Smash\" fries with your burger/chicken burger!! They're tossed with rosemary and olive oil.. 
The shakes are made fresh and they are delicious as well!! Great spot for a good burger and fries"}
{"text":"Great and clean place. Food is delicious! Love the taste! Great place to go eat !! The waiter was very nice and patient. Portions were quit small .."}
{"text":"This place was dirty dirty dirty!  I don't even think cockroaches would live there!  Presentation was less then desirable and fries were cold!  All the tables were dirty, garbage and food on the floor,  condiments were empty, burger was gross, ice tea container empty.  The two pickles that I ended up only eating was the best part of the crappy experience!  Franchise???"}
{"text":"Not only is this the cleanest nicest place I've ever been but the staff is seriously the nicest happiest people I've ever seen. I ordered online and came in with my service animal. They didn't hassle me about him, which I get almost everywhere even though he has his vest on but they were so sweet when they gave me my order. THEN I had to come back because I messed up when I ordered it and they were SO SWEET to me about it. Usually you'll get an eye roll from someone but not here. I love the food and the people who work here. Everyone come here!!! It's worth it if not just to be treated with kindness."}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner at this Smashburger. Wife and I both got the Bacon Avocado Club. the avocado on both burgers were rock hard, we had to ask to get new avocado that was not much better than the first. Both our burgers were burnt on the bottom and I was picking charcoal pieces off of it to eat it.

They messed up my wife's Smashfries and tried to fix it by half assing the toppings instead of doing it right.

We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The food at smash burger is delicious! You can create your own burger and make it how you desire. The employees are extremely friendly and curious. The girl Tyler is an extraordinary worker!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise to find the burger is as good as expected.  Very fresh and tasty!  The fries that we ordered also were a huge hit.  Do yourself a favor when you visit this or another location and give it a try.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Bacon Avocado Club burger is so flavorful and delicious, great customer service, clean and friendly. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"this was really really good food, maybe a little complicated for the first go around but worth it! Sebastian helped us order and made a recommendation on which of our coupons to use. He also stopped by to see how we were doing and how we enjoyed our food. he picked up our empty trays and offered to refill our beverages. The environment is restaurant style and a touch of fast food. absolutely delicious. thank you Sebastian!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in my opinion. Always fresh, always delicious. The bbq bacon cheddar burger is too good for words. Fries are always yummy, hot and crispy. Clean store, friendly staff. If burgers and fries were healthy I would eat here everyday."}
{"text":"While on the quest for the PERFECT burger, I came across SmashBurger on the way home. I had to TRY it. I ordered \"double bacon cheeseburger with jalapenos\" and must say it was the CLOSEST thing to the \"Ultimate Burger\" that I've found so far in Phoenix! I highly suggest SmashBurger and WILL return in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I placed a online order and the service at the Resturant was terrible. We arrived on time and waited at the sign that says online pickup. We were never greeted and there was one employee who refused to acknowledge our very existence. I patiently waiting until our order was bagged and the employee threw our order up on the waiting area. I said excuse I believe that is my order and he asked if I checked in with the busy person working the register. I said no I placed a online order, which was completely wrong except I item of 3, and was told to go check in. Then I had to wait again to get my drink cups! I will never be back or recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had at Smash burger couple of weeks back and it was really nice and we were excited to have another eating option around. Today we went and ordered the same as last time and it was horrible. It smelled of reused oil, the chicken in the burger though grilled was greasy and the salad was stale. 

We had to return the salad as it had bacon and we had specifically mentioned we don't eat bacon. In fact it was the wrong salad.
After eating the burger, I just canceled the salad order."}
{"text":"Burgers were of nice thickness, well made and tasted good. Buns were fresh and moist. Didn't really care for their smash fries which were skinny and on the bland side. Liked that they served vitamin water as a choice on their soda dispenser."}
{"text":"Salty not Juicy and meat was to crunchy. I was craving a burger I wish I would have went somewhere else. I will not have a craving for a smash burger in the future. I did try the Colorado burger. There seemed to be more bread than burger. FYI Colorado burger will be for limited time only."}
{"text":"Sorry to leave such a low review but the food was not good this last time- made it my last time actually based on this experience. And I really don't come here often just thought I'd give it a try and now I see why I don't. I saw ants on our table so we moved and I let the girl who brought us our food know this and she didn't do anything and another guest sat down at that table. :/ dust was all over the photos on the walls just gotta look up to see they don't have professional cleaning done. In n out from now on! If they don't take pride in keeping the place clean how do they work in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"Ordered a smashburger with avocado and bacon with smash fries and a normal lemonade - the burger was pretty greasy and so were the fries ...the quality of the food was underwhelming - but it was pretty quickly"}
{"text":"Yummm!!!! Burgers are juicy and cooked perfectly.  They have gluten free buns so we can finally enjoy a GOOD burger out. Great fries too. Can be a touch expensive (mine with fries and a drink was $12) but when you just want a no fuss great burger this is the place."}
{"text":"Dude and I will come here from time to time.

Mostly for their amazing fried pickles and Smashfries (rosemary seasoned, mmm), but the burgers are decent. Not quite Lobby's Burgers or Zinburger status, though, but it's not meant to be.

I usually get the Classic Smashburger (a classic cheeseburger, nothing fancy-schmancy) lettuce wrapped, hold the mayo and add some applewood smoked bacon. 

Dude likes the Arizona burger: Fresh jalapeños, habanero cheese, spicy guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, and chipotle mayo on a chipotle bun. 

All in all, pretty average but not horrible either."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to SmashBurger, going there because we had a 2-for-one coupon and had to go the AT&T store in the same strip mall.

There's been an explosion of different burger franchises in the last few years to challenge the leaders.  But I think SmashBurger has a way to go.

I was less than impressed by the [lack of] atmosphere.  I could be a fan of minimalist design, but I found the grey upper walls and khaki lower ones just depressing.  The counter where you order your food looks like they forgot to build the other half.  But they say you can't eat the atmosphere, so on to the food.

My husband and I both ordered the Mushroom and Swiss burger, but I substituted Pepper Jack cheese for the Swiss.  The burger was cooked medium-well, but was still juicy and didn't suffer from what I usually complain about - too much salt.  But there must have been such a tiny bit of the cheese, since I didn't get even the slightest kick from it.  The egg bun tastes very good, but isn't firm enough to hold up under the liquid from the burger, pickles, tomatoes, and grilled onions.  My husband ordered the sweet potato fries, which I'm not crazy about, so I just had the burger.  To me, they looked almost burnt, but he loves burnt food, so it was okay by him.  

Because I had just the burger, I left feeling as if I'd had an appetizer, not dinner.  I wish they offered a side salad, or something besides more fried stuff.  But they don't.  Makes me appreciate Chipotle even more.  Now that's a meal, even though it's not a burger."}
{"text":"Way better service today. I got the chix wit goat cheese and xtra pickles and sweet potato fries. Very awesome food for a pregnant lady like me. O yeah!! Thank you!!  Sheena!"}
{"text":"Honestly this location used to be a Burger King. I'm  not super fond of Burger King but it's fast food, I have sympathy. This Smashburger is a total rip off, and have worse burgers than Burgerking. I'm so disappointed and honestly think they need to change the business again. Burger patties are flat like McDonald's and they charge 9$ for a burger. It's not really anything to be appealed to. Probably worse than a fast food burger honestly. Change this place. Workers are uneducated about their menu also. Horrrrible."}
{"text":"I decided to eat at smashburger based on a review that I saw on aol, they reviewed the best burgers in America so I figured since it was one actually in Charlotte that I would give it a try, well let's just say I was really impressed.  It was amazingly wonderfully great, just really great.  I had the mushroom burger, with mayo lettuce and mator and it was great, the fries were even really tasty I really enjoyed my visit I look forward to going again really soon.  One more thing I realized that this place reminds me of a store that use to be in Charlotte called The Apple Deli, the burgers tasted the same, really seasoned and good."}
{"text":"We dont have one so I thought I would give it a try in Las Vegas. Foods not bad but not worth the price thats for sure. Plenty of good burgers in Vegas for 1/2 the price. In N Out and Five guys are within a mile either one is better. Both our fries had clearly been sitting for a while as they both just about room temp."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a Yelp event . The mission was to taste test milkshakes. I was happy to find out the Oreo Cookie Shake was not in a small Dixie cup...it was regular size! The shake was so good it had just the right amount of cookies in it and it had a creamy texture that was just right! It's not like some places where you have to wait until the shake melts a little so you can drink it through a straw. I was happy about that.. I also had a salad which was delicious!  I know salads and milkshakes aren't the healthiest paring in the world but it hit the spot!  The salad had strips of fried chicken in there that really packed a crunch! The fresh Spinach and crispy bacon, with the Honey Mustard dressing really complimented each other. There was also something else in there I couldn't quite place but it tasted a little buttery which was an added treat."}
{"text":"SmashBurger makes a decent burger that I would call maybe a step-up from a Fatburger. They use Angus beef and have fancier set of ingredients as well as a nicer dining area. I ordered a 1/2lbs Sin City burger and Smash Fries and the total was almost $10 without a drink. The burger was juicy but as some had said was slightly greasy probably because of the egg and bacon too. The fries were OK but they were the shoestring type which tend to be dry for me, and the rosemary seasoning totally overwhelmed the other flavors. I might go back to try other things but I like Fuddruckers and In-N-Out a little better."}
{"text":"12/22/10

Yelp offered Yelp members a chance to eat here for free, and hooray, I was one of the lucky few!  (Was a bit confused at first as this \"event\" was not organized like other meet-and-eat Yelp events; I was just supposed to mention to the cashiers that I was on the Yelp list- no big deal.)  Had the BBQ, Bacon, and Cheese burger and \"sweet potato smashfries.\"  Had to wait a bit on the fries, as the deal only included their regular \"smashfries\" (rosemary, garlic, and olive oil).  [FYI, other side fries' options were Haystack Onions and Veggie frites (flash-fried asparagus, carrots, and green beans- all sound great to me, except I'm allergic to carrots.  And maybe green beans.  LOL.)]  After finally trying the soggy sweet potato fries, I'd wished I'd stuck w/ the regular smashfries, which were actually tasty and nicely-crisped!)  The burger is definitely \"smashed,\" and it was definitely greasy, but, oh was it delicious!  Really loved the added crispy onions strings, too.  I had them put the BBQ sauce on the side (didn't know what ingredients were used to make it), so I can't review that.  Honestly, though, w/ the cheese, shoestring onions, crispy thick-cut bacon, and, of course, the grease, there's no need for the BBQ!  

The meal also included a free fountain drink and a sample of two choices of mixed-in ice creams (something akin to TCBY shivers, DQ's blizzards, and Ted Drewes' concretes).  I chose the butterfinger (yes, I know these cornflaked candies are off-limits to me, and perhaps the Haagen-Daaz ice creams, too-- some varieties have corn syrup and cornstarch in them), but I like Butterfinger, and so I dove in!  The 4 oz. sample was very, very good!  Great, even!  Too bad I couldn't eat the whole thing (the less allergens consumed, the better!), but I sooooooo wanted to, though!

Service was quick and efficient.  Friendly, too!  And the women's restroom was clean and fresh, and the dining area, while a little crowded, was also clean.  There's not a lot of fast-food places I'll go eat at willingly, but I definitely would not turn up my nose at Smashburger!"}
{"text":"I really liked the burger and the service provided. I would say the only downside is the location. It's tucked away next to a Chipotle and the parking lot can be difficult to get to. Other than the logistics, I think the food and service provided was excellent."}
{"text":"In one word... YUM!
Have had a hard time finding a good burger since moving here. Have been 2 times now (sorry, neglected to write a review after time 1) and find it really tasty, considering it's made to order fast food.
Burgers are juicy and tasty. I got the classic burger ('regular' size) both times. Their special sauce is yummy. Fries are really good, I always prefer shoe string so that made me happy. Get their special fries - I believe they are called Smash Fries - they truly are special and verrrry yummy!
Service is good. Super nice folks working up front! 
We don't eat fast food (BK, McD, W types), this is way beyond that - food, quality, atmosphere, service, everything. Promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What an experience. We walked in tonight to find a very long line and computers down. It looked like things were about to take a turn for the worse. As we walked in with our ridiculous amount of kids, a gentlemen held the door for us. Immediately we were all handed free drinks and apologized to for the wait. I then watched as the man who held the door immediately started bussing tables, checking on computers and talking to guests. He was not in any kind of uniform, and I'm assuming was either the GM, or an area manager. 

Once computers were up the line moved quickly. We had coupons and the girl at the register was sweet and accommodating even though it took longer. Our food came out lightning fast and was incredible. Coupons are gone, but we'll be regulars. 

Kudos. So impressed."}
{"text":"Nasty fries and ok bugers. Wouldve saved time going to McDonalds across the street. One of the girls took her cell out of her bra checked it, then stuffed it back before putting our to go order in the bag. Ew!"}
{"text":"Was greeted and order taken by a Mr. Mike Kelly. Made this trip to this Smash Burger location a complete great one! TEAM MEMBERS like Mike are hard to come by. He is a great asset to this organization and I definitely will visit this location again because of this experience!"}
{"text":"\"\"Because I'm Happy\"... yep that song is blasting through my head right now!  I actually really love burgers at SmashBurger's and was thrilled that one just opened up on my end of town.  My son and I went for a norm and as usual.. they did not fail us!  This location just opened up a few weeks ago. .very nice inside and they are super fast and very friendly!  
AND I just saw on their menu that they provide gluten-free as well!   I have a few different sandwiches I must try and report back as soon as possible.
The only reason this is not a 5-star is because the parking is fierce. There are a lot of excellent eateries in this little area and it is packed!"}
{"text":"Soooo yum! Finally got to try Smashburger after hearing so many great things about it. I went with the Classic Burger and the Sweet Potato Fries, it was delicious and super messy. Next time I would prefer the Onion Rings, because I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning on the Sweet Potato Fries. I really liked the variety of menu items and the restaurant itself is clean and modern. I was pleasantly surprised to find they served beer, as I like a cold one with my burgers! I will be back and SOON."}
{"text":"I've been to several Smashburgers and to this one more than once. It's been a 3-4 star experience most of the time, but I'll give 4 stars today because my burger this last time was totally awesome.

I usually get a simple burger, less is more -- but I decided to live on the cardiac edge and try the Sin City Burger, the local signature burger with bacon, haystack onions, grilled onions, an egg, American cheese, smash sauce and Lipitor. 

SO. DAMN. GOOD.

Usually, I find Smashburgers a bit on the overly salty side, but this was perfectly seasoned and all the artery-clogging deliciousness worth every bite. I could only eat half, but the rest reheated well the next day (though, wrap it up when you get home in clingwrap, the box lets the bun dry out).

In visits past I've had their Veggie Frites, which are a pass, in my opinion. Always super greasy with limp vegetables.  No one likes flaccid veg.  

I also am not a big fan of their turkey burger, for what it's worth. Bland, pre-formed patties -- or so it seemed.  

My doctor would probably agree it's a once-in-a-while thing, but I could easily go for another Sin City Smashburger."}
{"text":"The menu options aren't bad. The burger was very juicy and great you have the options of the size of the burger you want. The smash fries was a great addition with the burger."}
{"text":"Sin City burger (minus the bacon) is amazing.  On the salty side but I can overlook that.  Modern decor and clean.  I've been to the one in Summerlin a couple times as well and both are similar in decor and food quality."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular location about 30-40 times since it opened. The food is high quality. They have sweet potato fries that take the cake! Sometimes the chicken looks smashed but maybe that's what they're supposed to do, hence the name of the place. 

The eating area is quite nice with a variety of seating options such as eating outside (only an option 3 mo of the year). Bathrooms are nice but private. 

The staff is awesome! Usually there is only one person running register and maybe two other ones cooking and running food. The line to order and the time it takes to get the food isn't awful but some might not have the patience.  They all seem to be motivated and work hard. They often walk around and ask how the food is.

In summary:
Pros***
- great food (for a burger place)
- great staff
- clean comfortable facility

- understaffed"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  I had the spinach salad with grilled chicken.  Tons of spinach.  Maybe a little light on the chicken... But it was tasty, nevertheless.  The one complaint I have,  use degreaser in your mop buckets.  Your floors make me feel like Bambi on ice.  No traction whatsoever.  That part was pretty gross.  Other than that, good experience."}
{"text":"Burger has a good taste, I ordered the Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger, but it was small compared to some of the other chain burger joints.

The above burger, regular fries and regular drink was 11.03 with tax."}
{"text":"Love!!   Smashburgers!!  The French fries are my favorite but, most of the time I have the spinach salad which honestly is the best one in town."}
{"text":"Quality Burger! The Classic Smash is the best as far as I am concerned!
Not a fan of huge chunks of avocado or lots of mushrooms on my burger..... but thats just me......
I also messed up one time and got a salad...... I am still not sure why... wasn't thinking straight that day.... went to Smashburger and ordered a salad?
Stick with the burgers!"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about how good this place was, had some time to kill one day and saw it so i decided to check it out, it was around lunch time anyway. I go in, order the jalapeno burger with the smashburger fries, very good, i've maybe been back 2 or 3 more times since then and the food is always good, never had a problem with their service, my only critique would be that burgers could be a little bigger, they are kind of small."}
{"text":"I came here to eat after a friend had told me how good the place it was.  I have to say that hands down Smash burger is delicious!  Fries were also sooo good.  Based on the reviews I am guessing that prices in Caesar's Palace are much higher than what they are suppose to cost.  What can you do when you are in any Casino on the strip?  They are designed to rip you left and right.  I ordered the chicken burger with fries and it was delicious.  Staff was helpful and I got my food in a timely manner.  Price point per burger is about $10.  So if you get fries and a drink I think it would be around $14 to $15 bucks. It can be a bit pricey but what else can you do when you are hungry and you are on the strip."}
{"text":"Great burger but the onion rings are very disappointing. This is a chain/franchise restaurant. They have multiple locations across Calgary. The burger comes in regular, chicken or beef. Menu is easy to understand and everything is laid out in the burger menu

Came here with a friend and I got the Calgary Burger combo with onion rings. The Calgary burger was ok. The beef patty was a bit dry and over cooked. Sauce was lacking. But overall the burger was ok and i don't expect much for that price and especially for a fast food restaurant. The onion ring is like a one star. Its super greesy and salty. Not to mention the onion they used are not meant to be made into fried onion rings. They are tiny onions. When you hold the onion ring up it doesn't even hold its shape but just oily and soft. 

Overall, service was good. We were checked up on a couple times. On top, the place was very clean and brightly lite. The place is very quiet.

Parking is great here. Lots of parking spots available. Overall food is two stars and service pushes up to 2.5 stars and so overall is 3 stars."}
{"text":"My coworker and I visited this terrific joint today. It was extremely busy with about 20 people in the queue leading from the entrance to the till. It wasn't long until we were able to place our orders. The choices are great and the sides are unique. They literally have \"deep fried pickles\". They quantity was copious and the drink fountain had some house special choices as well, like their own concoction of iced tea, orange soda (like Crush). I found the food a bit oily (the oil wasn't drained off the fries) but overall the ambiance gets 5 stars and the service was pretty good! I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Great burger every time, this is one of those places that does not need reviews because it will do well no matter what.  I would give them 5 stars but I detected a slight sewage odor that I hope they fix soon.  I noticed it at the 20st & Camelback location also.  I usually just get the regular smashburger and a drink for almost $8.  It is always cooked exactly the same and very flavorful, the burger patty is a little larger than the bun which is exactly how I like it.  The garnish is always good here too and the buns are great (even have a few choices).  I have not tried anything else here since the burgers are so great.  Atmosphere is consistent with all their locations, very clean, food comes out very fast, and service is what it is.  I am also glad they were able to get a good restaurant in this old Dickey's BBQ location next to Chipotle.  I noticed they are putting another location next to the Chipotle on Lake Pleasant and Happy Valley since they really are the Chipotle of burgers."}
{"text":"I showed up today at 3pm (after lunch rush and before dinner rush) and there was no wait at all, service was good, and food was as awesome as expected.  I like this location since it is a mile from my home.  Ever since this place opened there has been a line out the door and even the parking lot is fuller than normal.  I actually gauge the craziness by first trying to park and if I have to park 3 to 4 rows away I just go elsewhere.  Burger is a consistent flavorful perfectly cooked piece of meat with perfect garnish every time.  Both the french fries and sweet potato fries rock here and they have Dr. Pepper which is a peeve of mine when places dont.  Plenty of seating and now that the place has died down I can actually enjoy going.  I fell in love with this place after they opened at 20st & Camelback and put the Fuddruckers out of business over there. (yes, its that good).  Sorry all the other peeps here had a long wait time, that would definitely ruin my meal too."}
{"text":"I love this Smashburger in the northwest valley, I love the concept, I love the modern & clean look, I love the sweet potato fries, and most of all I love the burgers.  Very consistent, taste, flavorful burger.  I have had the Arizona burger which isn't too bad here the other day, but my favorite is just the regular cheese burger.  I have never had a bad burger here but I have only been to this location once since is barely opened last month.  I have been to the 20th Street & Camelback location several times.  I also like the fact that they are open at 10am, which is about the time I am hungry since my day starts way before most peeps.  The service was good for me (sorry Bryan B, but I hope you give them another shot)  I never wait more than a few minutes for my meal but I usually stop in when it is not peak lunch hours either."}
{"text":"I love Smash Burger.  I was first introduced by someone I worked with, and didn't really know what to expect.  It wasn't really fast food, but it wasn't really like a sit down restaurant either.  The burgers are fantastic.  I love the bacon cheddar bbq burger, and get it most of the time when I'm there.  The burger is always juicy and hot, but can get a little messy sometimes.  I always end up using multiple napkins. The chicken sandwiches are great too, if you aren't so much of a burger person.  HOWEVER: my new favorites are ironically the hotdogs! They are amazing, and this just confirms that smashburger isn't just about the burgers! The staff is always friendly, and you never end up really waiting for your food, as it is usually brought to your table in 5 to 7 minutes after you order (depending on how crowded it is, and what time of day).  Always super impressed with my meals when I go there.  The only downside is that it is a little pricey.  Usually my meals run about 10 dollars, and if you think about it, its not really that expensive. But if you're on a budget, paying 10 dollars for a burger, fries and medium coke may be a bit too expensive for you. Even still, I will most definitely continue to go!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing as usual. For a create your own burger with lettuce, tomatoes and mushrooms. Their French fries are the best! Smash-tastic"}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers is much better for several different reasons, but I will be fair and give Smashburger a review just based on it's own merits. Plus there are none in Vegas now, so it useless to compare for the time being....

 The place didn't have a very friendly feel to it. I don't know why, it just seemed like the staff really didn't have much mojo for being there. Next, the burger was pretty good, but I fell prey to the temptation to make it too complex. With these burger places, if you keep it simple you usually end up with a tastier burger. I didn't follow my simple is better mantra and ended up with a big, sloppy mess. After I scraped off most of the mayo, ketchup, and smashburger sauce it was pretty decent. Where the two star review comes in is with the fries and milkshake.

 The fries were not very fresh tasting at all. It was like they were a little freezer burned and then fried in old oil. The milkshake was too watery-in other words, too much milk, not enough ice cream. Oh yeah, guess how much my sloppy burger, inedible fries and watered down shake set me back? $8? $10? $12?

All wrong, it was nearly $14 with tax! 

Really it was quite a ripoff if you think about it. I've been to normal sit down restaurants with true waiter service that will have a great burger for $8 or $9 that comes with fries and a deli pickle. 

Do you want a really good burger that will remind you of Fourth of July cookouts and happier times? Go to a Five Guys when they come, or even In-and-Out Burger. They are both better at what Smashburger tries to do."}
{"text":"Rather have a Mcdonald's burger! Burger patty was flat, didn't even come close to fitting the bun.  Seasoning on the burger patty left much to be desired.  Fries were underwhelming. Overpriced for the quality of the food. If you're looking for a burger joint, this is NOT the place!"}
{"text":"I used to absolutely adore their milkshakes. I would go out of my way and drive 20 minutes any time I need something sweet because the peanut butter milkshake is the best I've ever had.

A couple of months ago I had the worst experience ever from that stupid milkshake. I got one, and it had the worst aftertaste. I couldn't pin point it but tasted so weird. Like spoiled milk. But I hadn't eaten all day and I was starving so I drank most of it. Fast forward 20 minutes when I couldn't stop throwing up and the only thing I had all day was that milkshake from hell.

Every time I'm in that location, I always see the milk sitting out. I alway assumed it was because they went through it so much that they didn't really bother to put it away. I don't know and I never really cared until that day.

I sent smashburger a feedback email, because as it turns out, I got food poisoning. Literally the only thing I ate was the milkshake. They did not reach out to me or respond at all! So I have boycotted it and I tell everyone this story. Only come here if you want to get food poisoning. Maybe you want to lose a little weight for the new year, smashburger is the place for you! 

I realize this review is a little harsh, but maybe if they had responded to my email than I wouldn't have cared so much. After a month or two of no response, I forwarded the same email to them. Still no response. They really don't care about their consumers so I am no longer a consumer for them. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Wait 5 minutes in line and then 20 minutes for your to-go order. Ask to confirm no mayo and ranch on the side. Get assured that is the case. Get home. Sandwich slathered in mayo and ranch. If I wanted to have my order screwed up, I would go to Wendy's, would pay less, and not have to wait nearly 30 minutes for it!"}
{"text":"Give me another SinCity burger, please! How delectable it is!  A burger topped with an egg, bacon, and cheese.....drool! Their signature Smash Fries are good, but  not consistent in quality based on the many times we have been there. The salads are not bad either. Just make sure you tell them to put the dressing on the side otherwise your lettuce will be swimming in dressing. Would have been a 5 star, but the inconsistency of the quality of fries and drowning of salad dressing makes it a 4."}
{"text":"First this eating at Smashburger me and my wife we thought the burgers was great and the sweet potatoes fries grate to this one it in a food court but had no effect on the Quality of the food"}
{"text":"The food is average, but everything is extremely overpriced.

I ordered a single BBQ cheeseburger w/ bacon and it cost $6.50

I will probably limit my visits, because of this fact.

I mean, In&Out provides an equally delicious product for about 1/3 of the price.

I'm not sure how Smashburger justifies their prices.  They are not making gourmet hamburgers or anything."}
{"text":"Good food but expensive for what you get. Always a long line to order and they are not very fast at taking orders. Takes 10 minutes or longer to order just about every time.  Otherwise great food. I especially like the Baja Cobb salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try something different than our usual grub run so he took me here. The young lady at the register was very helpful and very patient seeing that this was our first time here. I ordered the barbecue bacon and cheddar and a side of fried pickles. So good! The burger had bbq sauce, cheddar cheese and fried onions on top of it. What's not to love? The fried pickles had just enough sourness to them. Service was quick, the restaurant, including the bathroom was very clean. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's fast... fast food... but in a good way.   I've eaten here a couple of times and the burgers and fries are very simple and delicious... cooked just right."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I always get the kids smash meal.  Perfect size for those of us trying to keep our girlish figures!

Mouth watering for the fries... I have to stop now....."}
{"text":"This location was pretty awesome when we went for lunch one day. We went there before Blu Sol Massage and Spa since it was nearby, but my husband assured me that it was incredible (he goes to one near his work in Tempe sometimes.) 

We ordered, the employees were nice, the food came out pretty quickly, and they have sweet potato fries! I usually hate hamburgers, but I actually enjoyed the Smashburger I had. I can't even remember what I ordered though, other than the delicious sweet potato fries :P

Oh, they also have bottled root beer there too. I'm not sure if that's common knowledge, but I thought it was pretty cool :)

Overall, great service, great food, and it was a pretty stress-free lunch. I felt pretty relaxed there, which is definitely a good sign. Usually I feel uncomfortable when I go out to eat at places like this!"}
{"text":"The manager A-Juan has no business working a counter much less managing a place.  Packed up my family and left because of his rude behavior.  He berated the two customers right in front of me so I was bracing myself as I approached him and he was certainly still in a fighting mood when I got to him. Below is a letter I am sending to anyone that will listen in corporate about this jerk.

I just had the most horrific experience with the \"Manager\" A-Juan at the centennial location in Las Vegas. Talk about someone who's unprofessional with no business working in an environment where he interacts with people! I arrived at restaurant at about 8:45pm with my 3 kids and wife after a long day.  The manager A-Juan was at the register waiting on the customer in front of me. He made a snarky comment to the customer that in order to receive a discount or something for his group he had to tell them in advance. The gentlemen told him it was fine and it wasn't a big deal but A-Juan kept commenting that this was their policy and that if he were a regular cashier they would need a manager to fix it which would hold up the line. The customer said he agreed and told him again it was fine. The guy looked annoyed but clearly wanted to just move on with his night.

We were up next and were not greeted with a \"Hello\"or \"Can I help you?\" He just looked at us blankly waiting for my wife or I to begin ordering. I began placing my order for a kids meal then I ordered 2 more cheeseburgers for my older kids. I started ordering my next burger when A-Juan rudely cuts me off and asks if we wanted fries with the last burgers I ordered. I said I would order fries but that I was still wanting to order a couple more burgers and we are not getting combos. He said I needed to order the fries now instead of more burgers if I wanted fries. I told him I had been to smash burger before and was never required to place my food order in a specific order before. He repeated that he needed my fry order now if I wanted fries or I can't get any. I asked him why he was getting an attitude with me and said I can order my food however I chose to. He told me I had the attitude and accused me of raising my voice at him. He said their policy was to order burger, fries, burger because it was easier for them to read my ticket. I told him I've been there before and was able to order all my burgers first with no issues. I was not ready to order my fries at that time.  I was having a hard enough time remembering all my kids complicated burger requests. I asked for his name and he just stood there with a blank look on his face. I read his name tag and told him I'd be speaking to the owner about his poor attitude and we left. I will never patronize this smash burger if this is the kind of \"manager\" you allow to run your business."}
{"text":"Burger is good. But the service is so slow I will not eat here again. 40 minutes after walking in the door I received my burger."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place to come with family. Very Good burger option with option to build your burger. Nice place to quick eat and go. Smash fries are very good..."}
{"text":"I really liked this location! Great service, general manager was incredibly kind! I like this place because they have great burgers and fries that aren't too greasy and they offer a wide selection of kid friendly options too. Great spot for lunch! Very clean."}
{"text":"A while ago i had issues because sometimes the patties were over-salted (so much so that it was not edible). Thankfully, that hasnt happened in a while. Unfortunately, there are other issues. I love smashburger, but this location keeps getting the order wrong. I got the bacon avacado club and get home to find no avacado. Got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it had no buffalo sauce. This has happened 3 or 4 times and its really unacceptable considering the price of their burgers. They need better quality control measures or they need someone to double check the food they sell to make sure all the food is made correctly and not missing KEY ingredients."}
{"text":"A flyer caught my eye so I saved it.  I finally used it last night and I must say the Large Mushroom Burger with Swiss cheese had my tastebuds doing somersaults.  The meat was fresh and cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Next time I will have them put some lettuce and onions..I think that will even taste better.  
My girlfriend had the regular smashburger and she also loved it.  The Oreo shake made with Haagen Das seemed a little small but boy was it creamy and delicious.  The real hit for both of us was the \"smashfries\".. yummy.. shoestring fries tossed in garlic, olive oil and rosemary.
Next time,I am trying the Spicy Baja Burger or maybe make my own...  The workers were courteous,helpful and knowledgeable.
Woohoo... I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service with delicious food every time. This place is clean and they get your food to you fast and with a smile om their face! Love it and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The cashier/waitress was unpleasant, a smile would be nice. I ordered green chillies on my chicken with melted cheese and she gave me green peppers on my salad no green chillies. When she brought my food I asked why no green chillies , she said you got green peppers there on the salad, Big difference Miss between chillies and peppers. She didn't offer to make it right just walked away. News flash, there are Lots of other restaurants in the same vicinity we don't need to eat there. It seems managers at a lot of places teach employees some aspects of how to do their job leaving other the personality factor and importance of great customer service."}
{"text":"1st Time here, the place was clean... the staff was super friendly and helpful.we used a buy one get one coupon and everything for 2 burgers was 8.78. The burgers were pretty good! I also had a side salad and it was mixed greens with balsamic!"}
{"text":"ive gone to other locations and never really enjoyed the burger because they taste so bland id like the fries more... but at this locaton- the burger meat was amazing! . this location by far has the best taste and quality to the burger! staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I'm in the middle so I'm giving 3.5 stars

Decent sandwiches and great fries in an unmemorable atmoshphere is just enough reason to give this place a try. One major pro are the variety of toppings, breads, and dressings gives the customer the opportunity to be creative. I like their spicy baja chicken sandwich the best. The sandwich was delicious and had the right balance of spicy and salty flavors. However, I recommend saying no to the spicy mayo because it's just another layer of unnecessary greasy salty mess. Their black bean burger was a disappointing mushy hockey puck. The more I bit into the sandwich, the patty began to fall apart. But for me, the  sides are the super stars here. I love their fries. They're crispy, hot and flavorful. I am willing to squeeze an extra hour at the gym to order a heaping plate of chili cheese fries. They offer milkshakes and beer if you really want to your veins to run lard. I've spent between $9-12 dollars on a meal. That's a bit expensive, but if you haven't tried, I think it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"My number one burger destination!  Prices are reasonable. Not a lengthy menu which allows them to do what they offer really well!  Burgers are cooked perfectly and toppings are fresh. Their shoestring fries are so good!!"}
{"text":"Other than a little too SALTY,  I loved Smash Burger.  
I had the Sin City Burger,  a freshly smashed patty from angus ground beef, fried egg, bacon, onion shoe strings and smash sauce. 
Yummy good.   
the Sweet Potato Fries tossed in Rosemary and garlic were different and tasty.  

Rick had the jalapeno burger and regular rosemary fries.  He wasn't a big a fan,  but I thought it was great.

Well he also likes football and I don't, so go figure!"}
{"text":"The quality here went down drastically since the last time I checked in. Dirty store, cleaning equipments placed visibly, some near food station, cooks throwing something in the kitchen, stale bread for kid's meal, soggy fries, floor staff talking over food counter..... Forgetting items to bring."}
{"text":"Food was good as I expected... The 5 stars though is for the service by both the girl taking my order and the gentleman who appeared to be the manager on duty.  The PB&J shake is borderline addictive. Even the bathroom was clean. I will be back soon. Might even drive clear across town to this location."}
{"text":"The Original Smashburger is super tasty but also very sloppy. Maybe I put on too much ketchup and mustard. It's a great deal. And close to AZ On The Rocks Gym. They serve beer, which sets this chain apart from others."}
{"text":"I had never ever been to a Smashburger before! My friends and I were enjoying some delicious In N Out for dinner, when I noticed Smashburger across the street and mentioned this fact. My friends said that they had awesome sweet potato fries. Even though I'd just had a full meal at In N Out, I could resist! We all went over - I got the sweet potato fries and my hubby got a milkshake. Both were fantastic! Great quality considering they're a fast food chain!! I'll definitely be visiting more Smashburgers from here on out!"}
{"text":"The service here was great! My cashier greeted me with a smile and his politeness was genuine. BUT I ordered the Club Grilled Chicken and the chicken breast is paper thin. I paid 7.29 for the sandwich and an extra .70 for the cheese. It was pretty much eating a bun. I would have been much happier walking right next door to McDonalds. Great Service. Less than average food."}
{"text":"Really, these burgers and chicken sandwiches are awesome. And the staff is usually very friendly which is refreshing. But the restaurant is always dirty. There will be staff standing around talking chatting laughing, and not washing tables or picking up garbage or old food. Every single time we go, the tables are disgusting. I really wish they could simply wash down their tables. It would go a long Way in customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"The new shake Chameleon Cold Brew is sooo good you gotta try it ! The manager Sergio Martinez was constantly looking out for our order and experience"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, as I've come to expect from smash burger. My problem was the fact that the dining area was dirty. I walked into an empty dining room and crew members doing nothing, place my order and look for a place to sit; which is where I encountered the problem. None of the tables were clean. All of them covered in dishes or remnants of food. And The floors littered with trash and food. I asked the crew member to clean the table off for me which she did with an attitude, and left all the the other tables still untouched. I'd rather drive to any other location.."}
{"text":"This place not bad. Pretty good for a burger place. Burgers were delish! I got the bacon cheeseburger  on multigrain bread. Really yummy! The reg fries were good. Don't bother ordering the shoe string onion things .. They're freaking oily and a waste of money. The rosemary fries are ok but too too oily. The prices are ok a bit much for a burger. $5.99 for bacon cheeseburger $2.99 for reg fries. $6.99 I believe for the bigger version of the AZ burger which my bf said was pretty good."}
{"text":"Buffalo and Blue Please!!! My first visit, and now I'm addicted! Great quality and great tasting burgers. I got the chicken buffalo blue and my friend got the original smashburger. We both loved it! They have a nice variety to fit any dietary needs, even  for vegitarians."}
{"text":"I ave eaten here twice and they have gotten the order wrong both times. The service is so slow that by the time I get my burger it's cold.  Both times they have also gotten the order wrong but rather than bring it up and wait a lot more longer I just ate it.  It seems that they are understaffed and it's hurting their service.  Lots of dirty tables."}
{"text":"Smashburger quickly became a favorite among my friends and I . It's a little more on the expensive side for a burger and fries, but to be fair, they are really tasty. This location was having trouble the first time I went. I ended up waiting about 45 minutes after ordering. That was pretty ridiculous. The burger was a little above average, but the fries were lukewarm. I sent my feedback to the support on their website, and was was contacted quickly with and apology. They wanted a chance to make it up to me and sent me Smashbucks. I tried it out again, and it was much better. The customer service was great and I can respect them for making the situation right."}
{"text":"The burger and smash fries were good. I have been to three locations, and though 59th and thunderbird is still the best, I wouldn't disregard this location. I went around 8pm on a thursday night. There were about 8 other people in the restaurant. The burger and fries took about 10 minutes, which is okay. Food was warm.  Luckily I didn't have to horror stories like some of the other reviews here."}
{"text":"I have been to three smashburgers around AZ, and this is by far the best one. At least at this location, there is consistency. Food is made well and warm. It is a bit expensive, but quite good I think."}
{"text":"Man, I can't believe I am about to say this, but... um... this place may be better than In N Out. I know, I know... it sounds blasphemous, but hear me out, please.

I've made a few trips here, and I've never been let down. At all. On my last trip here, I bought food for myself and my way-picky brother. I bought him the larger cheeseburger with fries and a Nutter Butter shake. I got the spicy burger, rosemary fries, and the shake, too. Altogether, I spent $26. It's more expensive than In N Out, sure, but it's worth it.

First of all, the meat was delicious. It was perfectly juicy and tender without being undercooked. It was great, and seemed a mile apart from McDonald's-type stuff. Win. The bread was better, too, as were all the little extras: crisp lettuce, cold onions, juicy tomatoes... the works. Everything was great, and really in a different league than any other fast food place. The sauce on my spicy burger was great, too, and was more \"gourmet\" than I expected. It was another little bonus that kicked this place up another notch. When we finished our burgers and fries, both of us were fully stuffed. It's a lot of food, without really considering the shake. The shake was delicious, and way thicker and tastier than I expected. Again, it's more upscale. It's not even fair to compare Smashburger and McDonald's. 

I will return to this place time and again because it's so good. Everything is better than it is at a McDonald's, and AT LEAST as good as In N Out, if not better."}
{"text":"Don't be mad at me when I say what I'm about to say, but, here it is: I'm almost certain Smashburger has better burgers than In N Out. 

I know, I know... In N Out is awesome. They have great burgers, fries, shakes... all that stuff. Plus, In N Out is a staple in the UNLV student's diet as it's so close to campus. And, yes, prices at In N Out are fair. I agree with all that. So why is Smashburger better? Read on.

First of all, this review is specific to this Smashburger. The other location I go to, the Lake Mead location, is really good, but is more hit-or-miss. This location seems to be consistently good, so I like it a little bit more. 

Now, the food: the food here is good. My burger was really good, the tomatoes, lettuce and onions were good, and the sauce was good, too. It was a good burger! The bread was pretty good, too, so no complaints in that department. The fries were good, even though they were a little bit thinner than I like them. All in all, great food! Great burger, good fries. 

As other reviews have noted, this place is more restaurant than fast food. The prices reflect that, too, so be prepared to pay more than you might want to. Still, this is definitely a place you want to check out!"}
{"text":"Did not like the burgers. Onion haystack was dripping in oil and the burger got cold before I could finish it. For the price of everything I expected better. Will not be going back to Smashburger."}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Friday night, there was no wait and our food came out very quickly. They forgot the fries I ordered but remedied it quickly. I had a large BBQ, Bacon, Cheddar Burger, fries, and a beer. It was very tasty and I ate the entire thing. I thought it was a little over priced... the fries should come with the burger. My wife had one of their salads and loved it. It looked delicious and fresh. I was surprised a burger joint had a decent salad. I would return and recommend."}
{"text":"For me, Smashburger has really gone downhill in the last few years. 3 years ago I would have ranked it in my Top 3 of burger joints - really tasty burgers, fries and shakes at a semi-reasonable price. Then something happened - ownership change? corporate mandates? whatever it was, Smashburger changed almost overnight.  2 years ago we had a horrible experience at the Baseline location. A year ago another horrible experience at the Alma School location. Thinking this new location on Elliot might be different, I went again today. I got their new Sin City Burger, Sweet Potato Fries and Salted Caramel Shake all to go. The service was decent, the cashier was quick and efficient but not friendly at all. I got my food quick and drove home. While the sweet potato fries were pretty crisp and not very greasy, the burger was the exact opposite. It was soggy, greasy and super salty. I guess that's what I get for ordering a burger with a fried egg in it but I was not expecting the sogginess or the saltyness. Then came the shake, which I did not think you could ruin. It was good until I hit the bottom and found a couple of...not sure what they were, globs of something at the bottom that tasted bitter. I immediately spit it out and was done. I had a coupon so it wasn't that bad of a price, but the food was not great. I'd take The Habit or Five Guys over Smashburger now. Oh well, live and learn."}
{"text":"Okay, I kept putting off on eating here because I was not too much of a burger fan.  But I don't know what it is about SmashBurger, but they certainly have me hooked.  Its one of my preggo cravings, when I'm allowed to have the extra calories.  

I guess I've had my share of dry soggy burgers that it just made me stray away from burgers all together.  Then finally my hubby managed to drag me here because the rest of the family out numbered me on saying yes to burgers.  They managed to drag me here since it was near by, plus he said they had salad options.  Which I have yet to try, LOL.  

Well, if I am at a burger place, I will have to try their burgers.  Thats just the way I roll.  So, that is is exactly what I did.  

What did I go for? I went for the Truffle mushroom Swiss burger-chicken that is, and veggie frittes (& tasted the sweet potato fries).  

Buns, not even soggy.  Whole Burger, not even smashed.  What is smashed is the actual patty, but I think I like the concept because its cooked through and I don't have to smash my burger to get it to all in one bite.  

I have to say, I'm seriously hooked.  This location is also very friendly.  When you stare deeply into that menu, they'll even make a suggestion.  

ooooh, I must try their nutella milk shake.  Everyone was getting shakes, so thats my next thing to attack.  

These burgers...yes, like Hulk...SMASH!!!!!"}
{"text":"I seriously am obsessed with smash burger.  

Jesse could tell you I was not a fan of burgers, that was until I was introduced to Smash Burger. Nom nom nom is all you will hear from me.  Seriously, like hulk, I SMASH these burgers.

My go to would be either the Sin City or the Truffle mushroom swiss, burger or chicken, they are both delicious!

I like mixing it up with the sides, but when you want to save a bit of calories and get your veggie on, have the veggie frites.  BUT I save my calories for the shakes, hahaha!!

Additionally, service here is always friendly.  Bonus for a fast food joint.  

If you are dining in, bring a jacket, it's cold in here."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place. People told me their burgers were better than Five Guys. Alas, I do not hold the same regard. I found Smashburger's burgers greasy. Maybe some people enjoy this. I did not. Also, their burgers didn't have a great flavor. Their buns were quite soggy as well. The fries (and I sampled all 3 varieties) were mediocre at best. I'll stick to other burger places from now on."}
{"text":"This place is so damn tasty.  I love a good burger and I recommend this place highly.  I don't know why I didn't give it 5 stars.. 4.5?  Ok, there we go.

I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and the thing literally melted in my mouth. You have to be careful cause you could literally inhale these things in a matter of seconds.  They are that good!

A big plus that his place has is that they sell fried pickles.  I don't know of another small place like this that does.  Veddddy goood.  

Thankfully this place is two blocks from my house, so easy access.. lol."}
{"text":"Decent little burger joint.  Nothing fancy with the burgers but it ended up being quite delicious.  Some places go over the top and pack a million things into a monstrous burger,  but not smash burger.  So if you are looking for something simple that tastes good,  then this your place.
I like that they give you three burger patty size options, so depending on your craving you can up size your burger. I opted for the bacon cheeseburger which was tasty, ands also filling. I was diggin' the smash fries with its oil and herb goodness. We tried the veggie frites which were good.  I would prefer them to have a crispness about them but they were on the soggy side. The wife liked that they had vitamin water as an option to thier drink selection. It was a nice healthier option than just your usual sodas.
Overall we liked the place and would come back again."}
{"text":"I am not a fan.  I have tried Smash Burger several times.  All at this location.  I have had the Mushroom Swiss burger a few times.  A cheeseburger with a few toppings.  And most recently the Spinach and Goat Cheese Salad.  I asked to add a burger to the top, even though they only offer a chicken add on.  They were happy to oblige.  This is probably the best thing I have had here.  I am giving 2 stars because all the burgers I have had previously were really greasy and my salad was supposed to have raisins, dried cranberries, pumpkin and sunflower seeds...it did not.  This along with the fact that I have not been in this place where we could find a clean table.  The tables are always nasty."}
{"text":"After two trips here, I think it is alright.  I haven't been here since they first opened, and it was not on my radar for nearby options at work.  My colleague and lunchmate suggested it, and off we went.

The burger itself was great.  I ordered a small make-my-own burger on classic egg bun, topped with grilled onions, fresh jalepenos, fried egg, avocado, and goat cheese.  For some reason, this combo truly worked.  It was darn tasty.  The egg was not runny at all, but it still added a special flavor.  It was initially forgotten when my burger arrived at the table, but was quickly brought back.

I also ordered the sweet potato smashfries.  The concept of the added spices is great on fries, but the sweet potato fries looked double fried, completely different than the regular fries my friend had.  Also, each bite tasted like soaked in oil - and it was oozy.  I did not eat much of the fries.

It is quite expensive (especially with my add ons) but the small burger is the right size and as a clean slate is under $4.  I would return for my specific combination of deliciousness."}
{"text":"A little greasy for my taste. Still tasty though. Fast friendly service. Affordable price and convenient location."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, and good beer prices.   I hope the hamburger is natural raised as they advertise.  The place is clean.  Prices are reasonable too.  Only downfall is that they should have a few televisions there with sports on while someone is having a beer and burger."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple. Decent burgers, Haagen Daz shakes are excellent, and fries are great. Made a custom burger with bacon, bleu cheese, and egg bun, pretty good. The shakes are to die for, chocolate namely. The beef is soft but sometimes comes a little greasy. Smash burger gets two less stars simply because of the nonfriendly approach to newbs (funny, but not cool. hah!)."}
{"text":"I'm impressed by the cleanliness, friendliness & food hotness! When have I ever had a hot burger with hot fries? Umm, never until I ate at Smashburger! Burgers from other restaurants & burger joints are warm to cold, but not Smashburger!!!
You order at a counter and they bring the food to you at a table and your table is even bussed. 
The burger was tasty & delicious! Their Smashfries, tossed with rosemary, garlic & olive oil are to die for! They're thin, not big/thick and were perfectly cooked!  They even have sandwiches and salads. If I have the same experince whenever I go back to try something different, I will give them five stars!"}
{"text":"I found this hamburger joint to be a complete delight. We stopped in more out of geographic convenience and ended up surprised at the quality and tastiness of the food. My well-done burger was juicy, carmelized, and delicious. We also tried among the table a spinach salad, regular and 'smash fries', a hot dog and a grilled cheese sandwich. From the artisan breads to fresh meats and produce, you will be pleased with your meal at this little gem in the shopping center."}
{"text":"Again, great experience here. The cashier was very nice. We were served quickly after placing our order. My son loved the chicken fingers, but the BBQ was a little to spicy for him. I had the turkey burger and it was amazing!  I don't eat beef and there are very few turkey burger options around so I am stoked to find such a delicious one. We will definitely be frequenting more often now that I have discovered the turkey burger. This makes the hubby happy because he loves this place for regular burgers. The only complaint I can even think of is that the amount of bacon on his burger was tiny. It didn't even seem like it was equivalent to one slice. We just know to order extra next time."}
{"text":"Despite the few not so great reviews recently... I really wanted smash fries and their Baja salad so I begged my bf to be adventurous and let us drive 25 mins to this location. (Which used to be 5 mins from our old house) like I said, based off the so so reviews I was prepared for maybe lackluster experience, but any smash is better than none, right? 

Well, lemme tell ya!! Everything was perfect! I mean so amazingggg! Every order of the many, many orders of fries along side the salads were perfection, hot, crispy, fresh and so flavorful! And the salads were equally perfectly fresh and flavorful! 

Thank you Smashburger for not letting me down despite what a few people have to say about you!"}
{"text":"Well, this is the place that got Centennial Toyota a star... it was that good! I admit that I'm an In N Out guy so I may be a little biased when it comes to burger places... but this place is a close second to In N Out. 

I give Smash Burger higher marks then \"5 Guys\" because there is something about their burgers that stand out and is unique. I loved the egg buns and the Smash sauce was good, not quite In N Out's spread good but we were inspired to take my Girlfriends Dad back to Smash Burger the next day to try one. I loved that there were options when it came to sides, Smash Fries were ok, regular fries were better and the Onion Strings were awesome! Fries wise, SmashBurger has both 5 guys and In N Out beat! 

Bonus points for having Cherry Coke (that worked) and Milk Shakes rather then peanuts. However, two people for lunch was just over $20 vs In N Out being about $12 so the value is still better at In N Out. I would say this, if Vegas didn't have an In N Out I would be just fine having Smash Burger as my substitute."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor; just go to Blacow.  You get a far superior burger without all the hassle.  So disappointed in this place, and feeling mighty guilty for NOT sticking with a sure thing."}
{"text":"Great meat and flavor. Nice touches on all. A little weak on the cheese portion, but it's included in the price ( good )

Oh, and IBC rootbeer in a frosted mug= Heaven !"}
{"text":"I WAS SO SAD TO FIND OUT I WASNT GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST BURGER EVER!  after driving by and hearing all the rave about this place (and since kilroys kitchen was closed) i decided today was the day! Customer service good! The food is a different story.....i ordered their spicy burger and their bbq and rosemary fries and the results????? My burgers were cold and tasted re heated not much flavor and all the topping on one side of the burger.....I asked for extra jalepenos and un less they usually put two on the sandwich the four that were on there were far from extra for me.....the fries were really good but for $20 bucks for two burgers and an order of fries equal to the same amount in mc donalds medium fries i would have to say to eat here again they would have to bundle everything and throw in a drink for 2.99 and i might MIGHT think about eating here in a pinch. Not to mention the place was empty and i wasnt a victim of rush hour!"}
{"text":"Went into Smashburger for a late lunch yesterday with my hubby. He had eaten there before but it was my first time there and I was excited by all the fun options to customize your burger. I got a 1/3 pound burger on a chipotle bun with ketchup, mustard, pickle and haystack onions. I also got an order of sweet potato fries and a chocolate shake. 

The girl taking the order was extremely friendly and offered me a cup for water since my shake would take a while. But it really wasn't long at all before someone brought out our food. Unfortunately they had forgotten the haystack onions on my burger and it took a while to come back after that. While we waited, I took in the ambiance of the place. I know some reviewers criticized it as too trendy but I have to say that I liked the decor. And I also enjoyed the music selection. Given that kind of vibe and the fact that they serve some good bottled beer, this would almost be a place to meet some friends after work. However, instead of that kind of crowd it was mostly middle-aged couples, obviously out on a weekend excursion to the nearby Lowe's, each with 2+ kids in tow. 

However much I do enjoy trendiness, I think the food is still the most important aspect of a restaurant. And I did not enjoy my burger half as much as I thought I would. I don't mind the fact that it is smashed thin and overcooked - I like them very well done. But it was so greasy, it just really didn't have a good flavor at all. And the chipotle bun tasted like a regular white bread to me, I did not get any spiciness from it at all. I love sweet potato fries but these were inconsistently cooked. Some were burnt and saw were almost raw. The chocolate shake was just ok. Overall, I think I would have preferred the burgers/shakes from Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"Tried the place for the first time last week and it was delicious. Burger was very flavorful, loved the fries. Wish there was one closer to my area, I would visit often. If you haven't tried it yet get on over there and give them a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Smash Burger is my second favorite fast food burger place. Of course Fat Burger is #1. They have great burgers and fries here and I like the fact that they offer whole Wheat Buns.

The meat tastes better because the way they smash the burger on the grill. It Sears the meat and gives it that distinct taste.

I definitely recommend Smash Burger."}
{"text":"Very YUMMMO! I'm not such a burger Fan... but this place may have changed my mind. When my Fiance and i go out to eat we usually share an order of whatever we both feel like eating. WE ordered a make your own burger, which consist of avocado, Jalapenos (my fav), grilled onions, cheese, and 1/3 pound of juicy meat. It was so yummy I had my fiance go back and get another burger the next day! I suggest everyone to at least try this place once! :) *enjoy*"}
{"text":"Nice Burger, fries are kinda weird, I used a fork to eat them...
Used coupon for S I said, always good to try a place out...
Free burger with drink and fries purchase, so my order was under 5 bucks after taxes.
Good, I'd probably come once a month or 2 to indulge, without the crap they serve at Crap in the Box, McChina's, (with processed Chinese meat for MeDog province), Burger Krap, Wendy's Site...."}
{"text":"After a poor experience 2 months ago, the family decided to give SB on Power and Baseline a chance for redemption. Fail. Everything tasted old and was poorly made. This location defiantly doesn't have the same consistency and care as other locations. Salad anyone??"}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers very often (and actually the last time I ordered from here it was chicken), but I think Smashburger does very good fast food (and yes...it IS higher quality fast food, but fast food nonetheless). 

The few times I've came here it's been takeout and normally I order ahead of time. Orders have always been correct (which should be a given, but it's easy to make mistakes on burgers with so much customizing). Like I said, the last time I ordered from here I had chicken (the \"Arizona\" style burger), and I was delicious. The chicken was cooked properly and not dry, and all the veggies tasted fresh. I believe you can order any burger with chicken, beef, turkey or black bean. 

I also like that they have sweet potato, regular AND \"smash\" fries. Last time I got the later and they were really good.  They come with herbs on them (I believe garlic and rosemary), which adds really good flavor. I also like that they're \"skinnier\" fries.

On the rare occasion I do want a burger/chicken sandwich from a fast food type place I like Smashburger and this location always seems friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The food is 5 star, but the service... not so 5 star. Our table was dirty and one burger was lacking what should have been on it. But they did help us with the issues promptly. The mushroom Swiss burger is fantastic and the smash fries are to die for. Good food, average service."}
{"text":"By the looks of the reviews, this place is either a hit or a miss; thankfully, my experience resulted in a hit!

I've heard plenty good about Smashburger, so checking in to what I saw was 3.5 stars on Yelp surprised me. I can see the flaws in the service. There wasn't anyone at the counter for the few minutes I scanned the menu; there was no smile, very little eye contact, and by the looks of it, some time had passed before used tables were cleared and wiped clean.

But what I did get (dramatic pause) was a perfectly cooked Truffle Mushroom Swiss burger, Smash fries with rosemary-garlick-y goodness in every bite, and a rich, classic Oreo milkshake. Also, the interior is dimly lit which made me forget all about the Vegas heat.

And for that, my dearest readers, I shall return!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Love going here around 9pm and getting any type of burger with a fried egg lol. The cashier was quick and polite and they even helped me decide on a milkshake (butter finger). Definitely one of my favorite burger spots in Summerlin."}
{"text":"The list of fast food burger grows, and unfortunately, Smashburger is near the bottom.

If for some reason you get sick of Five Guys, In-n-out, Four peaks, and Lobby's, then give this place a try (although to be honest, Lobby's and this place are kind of tied).

I got an Arizona burger. It was good, no doubt about it. But just a bit pricey. A 1/2 lb burger + fries comes out to $10. For $10 I'd rather go to Four Peaks, or Five Guys (get 2 burgers) or In-n-Out (2 burgers + fries). Of course, you get more meat at Smashburger, but honestly 1 double double at In-n-Out or Five Guys and some fries split between two is enough for a meal. This place tastes really good, but it loses on value.

In fact, I had a B1G1 coupon, so I brought my lady along and she got a salad. There is no doubt she enjoyed the salad. However, neither of us thought it was a good value even at B1G1 (Remember when Chipotle had B1G1? That was a damn good value).

Unfortunately, if you're in the Tempe area you should go a little further to try to get a table at Four peaks. Better value and better food there. If you can't wait, hit up Five Guys on Mill or In-N-Out on 202/Rural."}
{"text":"Finally tried a beef burger vs. a chicken burger here.  The meat was nicely cooked, juicy, with good flavor.  I had it Arizona style with freshly sliced jalapenos, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion and habanero cheese.  The jalapenos were arranged in a neat cross design (See picture, they must have been feeling creative that day!).  Service was fast and friendly.  I did like the beef burger, but I'm still a bigger fan of the chicken burgers!"}
{"text":"Ordering online to this location was extremely easy and convenient since you can prepay for your meal and select the time you want it ready. My Arizona burger was made right on time and packaged very well with the modifications I requested (No onions to avoid stinky onion breath at work). The burger itself tasted like your usual Smashburger with great flavor and heat from the raw jalapeño. Definitely a good place to get lunch!"}
{"text":"Great service! Fantastic location  I love that there are several good options available in the same parking lot  Everyone is happy 
Fast service, online app to order for pick up! 
Gluten free Udi's bun available  Yum!! Try the veggie frites and the milkshakes rock!"}
{"text":"I can only speak for the takeout quality. By the time I drove 5 miles to my house and ate the food it was still really good and wasn't soggy at all. I was really impressed. Usually In-N-Out is the only company that can pull that off in my experience. Their burgers are high quality and I would put their burger quality closer to restaurant quality rather than fast food quality. Their fries and onion rings are amazing too. I had a really great experience and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Damn, I feel like a fat pig. That might be the only meal I need today! Being a nice weather, Friday kind of day I headed to the ASU campus to give the newly opened Smashburger a try. I have no prior Smashburger experience, but it was a new place to Yelp and I love me a burger.

I drove, and parking is a bit tricky if you do not want to pay for the parking garage. Fortunately I found a spot down the street in the 25 cents per 10 minute parking meters. The restaurant is in a good location -  plenty of traffic from foot, car and bus. Being right off campus I am sure it will be a big hit with students. Once inside, I found the restaurant small and cramped. The line was to the door (probably being new, being Friday and being noon didn't help). I placed an eat-in order and waited by a large table with several people gathered around. Looking around, all tables were full. Counting the large table, there were only 11 tables inside and a bar that seated 3 in the back. Glancing outside, the patio seating was full as well. 

I ordered the Arizona smashburger - which comes in 1/3 lb or  1/2 pound sizes. The 1/3 pound is $5.99 while the larger size is just a dollar more, so I went large. The burger comes with habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo, jalapenos and a chipotle bun. I could taste the guacamole, but the most noticable taste for me was the strong onions. The jalapenos were not noticeable.  I also ordered the smashfries which as small, thin fries seasoned with rosemary, olive oil, garlic and \"other herbs\"...Safe to say no one is kissing me immediately after eating this meal.

After placing my order and waiting at the table for it to arrive, I then had to wait for a table to open up. It might take a bit of waiting to get seated, so be prepared. If you go with more than one person, it would be best to collect the orders and have one person scout for a table. 

You definitely need two hands and a stack of napkins for this monster! Honestly it was difficult to wrangle - meat sticking out of the bun in all directions, guacamole sliding out, slippery tomatos and the mayo made for one messy sandwich - but I pushed through and eventually got a good grasp on the beast. I think it may be the best burger I have ever purchased. I would put it up against any backyard burger I have had in my day. The fries were simply amazing! I love rosemary and the combination of ingredients was unique and flavorful. 

Another aspect of the restaurant was that it was a little loud. Most likely not a good spot to go if you want to meet and get to know someone through introductory conversation...then again the oozing of quacamole down the face probably wouldn't make a good first impression either...

All totalled, with burger  ($6.99), fries ($1.79 with sandwich purchase) and drink ($1.69) came in with tax at $11.39. A little higher than a standard fast food burger, but 10 times the taste! If you are not into burgers, they have chicken, salads and hot dogs to choose from. If you don't want one of the standard 5 burgers, you can create your own. Definitely a good option...

If you want a good burger experience, give a Smashburger (and Smashfries!) a try!!"}
{"text":"If you want a thick greasy delicious burger that will clog your remaining arteries and wreck your gastrointestinal tract, come to smash burger ;)."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Burgers are a bit small but the Arizona black bean is worth trying as well as their fried pickles and milkshakes. Only down side is you leave the place with the aroma of seared meat all over your clothes."}
{"text":"Got the classic burger medium size for 7 bucks with drink no fries. Yes the price is correct and I got it from the drive through window. The taste was I don't know. The bread was good and I think it was the only good thing about this burger. Suggestions: make it more affordable probably people will order more."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! The employees are so friendly and the food is delicious!!! I Have ate there everyday since being in Vegas!!! It is going to be so sad when I leave tomorrow and I will not have a smash burger for awhile:-(   I would highly recommend SmashBurger the hamburgers are the best and all the employees are so friendly!!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Smashburger!! The burger never disappoints. Sweet potato fries are delicious and so are the smash fries. Haagen Dazs shakes and beer if you're in the mood; what more could you ask for?? Trying the chicken club and haystack onions today I'm sure they won't disappoint either"}
{"text":"Best Smashburger location I've ever been to, throughout AZ. GM was nice as can be, going above and beyond. Burger was the best I've had from Smashburger, extremely well made and timely!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped into Smashburger on a whim one late afternoon.  We had never been, were in the mood for burgers, and were already in Stonecrest so ...why not?!?   WOW, it was REALLY good!  My son had a Bacon Cheeseburger and and I had the Avocado Club Burger.  The burgers were fresh, hot, and delicious.  The shoestring-style fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly.  Service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was clean and comfortable.  I do believe we have a new burger go-to place!  I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best buffalo chicken (crispy) sandwich I have ever had! crispy on the outside, tender and juicy inside, crumbled blue cheese,  hot sauce, beautiful sliced tomatoes and lettuce on an awesome roll."}
{"text":"Smashburger has good food. It's almost great food.

I love the fact that they have fried pickle chips. 

Their burgers are also very good. I love the Arizona burger, somewhat just because I'm just partial to anything with Arizona in the name, but also because I like a good spicy entree.

The biggest disappointment I've had was with the side salad. It costs 2.99 and it is so small.

I enjoy the food, but some of it is priced higher than it should be."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of burger joints. I've eaten probably a handful (if that) burgers in the last three years so when my sister told me she was craving a good burger, I was disappointed lol But to make her happy, I let her choose which led me here. I've heard good reviews about this place and my sister told me it's one of her top favorite burger spots in Vegas. 

I liked how the place is set up. There are booths as well as high tops and the theme of the place is inviting.

I ordered the Sin City burger as well as the Smash fries. It came out fairly quickly -- they bring it to your table which has all the condiments set up for you. 


The burger has smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions and haystack onions, fried egg with an Egg bun and their signature Smash sauce. I didn't get to experience the Egg bun because they ran out so I had to substitute it with a wheat bun. But nonetheless was it so good! I couldn't help stopping after every bite and telling my sister how delicious it is. And the garlic fries were also pretty good. 

For two Sin City specialty burgers, two Smash fries and two fountain drinks, the price was $22 which is definitely worth it. 

I can't wait to go back. No, seriously lol"}
{"text":"The star for the hustle of this place. Wasn't crazy busy but I noticed there were many things that went wrong with not just my order, but other tables. I felt bad and I didn't want to give them a hard time, so I waited patiently for my food that I called in for pick-up. Upon arrival, my food was handed to someone else. I waited for about 15 minutes before getting my bag, but as I was walking out noticed that it was missing my smash fries. So I went back in and waited maybe another 7 minutes. The manager was apologetic and so was the cashier, but as I saw them offer the table next to me free entree passes, etc. and another table the same thing, I wasn't offered it after the two mistakes. It was a bummer."}
{"text":"A little disappointing.

I've only had Smashburger once before. My coworkers picked me up a Sin City burger from one of the earlier Vegas locations. I remember it being a well-balanced burger and I enjoyed the experience.

Fast forward to now. They finally opened a location closer to work. I again ordered a Sin City burger. This time, I asked for the multi-grain bun. I added a side of Smash Fries. They are the same price as regular fries, but add rosemary, olive oil, and garlic to the mix.

The short of it? The fries were salty and the burger was good but not great. The bacon on the burger overwhelmed the overall flavor. It may have been compounded by the salty fries. By the end, I was thankful to be done eating.

I'm handing out the good old 3-star treatment for now. I'll definitely return to try a different burger and probably skip the fries. On the positive side, they just opened and were handling the lunch rush quite well.

On yet another positive note, my just-cleaned teeth still feel clean (thanks Floss Dental). I better floss again."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that this is solely a review of the Sin City Burger. A coworker made a Smashburger run for lunch, so I put in an order for a 1/2 pound SCB. I haven't been to the restaurant, so I have no idea about service or environment.

Having said that, the SCB was crazy good. It's a little strange that the burger patty has almost twice the square inch-age as the bun. I guess that's the result of the \"smash\" in the company name. Despite its juiciness and relatively small bun, I was somehow able to eat it all without mess. Maybe I'm just biased towards any burger containing egg, but the SCB is oh-em-gee good.

I've heard good and mediocre things about Smashburger. I'm glad my experience swayed to the good side. I noticed they have malts on their menu. Ever since I learned that Sonic no longer does malts, I've been looking for them everywhere. I foresee Smashburger in my not-too-distant future.

BTW, why the heck does their logo look like Gamestop?"}
{"text":"Arizona burger is my fave!! Have always had wonderful customer service and I come here almost weekly!"}
{"text":"A couple coworkers and I stopped in one day for lunch. The line was long but we got through it fairly quickly.  I was excited to try this place as I heard such good things, but when we waited over 10 minutes for our burgers, it was rather disappointing.  The burger was ok...I prefer Red Robin's thick burgers to Smash burger's thin ones.  I had their fried pickles which were covered and swimming in grease.  For almost 12 bucks for a burger, side and fries I don't know if i'll be back."}
{"text":"I always get the spicy Baja and I have never been disappointed. Good flavor and juicy meat. Their fried pickles and fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch  here today. We both had turkey burgers...it's the best we have ever had...we ordered one large order of sweet potato fries and it was plenty....restaurant was clean  and staff was friendly too. First time to Smash Burger..won't be the last this is our new burger place...."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today...very clean with friendly service and the food was awesome too. We both had the turkey burgers and one large side of sweet potato fries....will be back first time visit"}
{"text":"Horrible taste. Like onions in beef.   Horrible.

Don't be foolish spending $10 for a burger that tastes worse then Burger King.  Run!!!!!!  Do not support this horrible tasting burger place."}
{"text":"One of the  best burgers spots I've been to. Really good customer service as well. The rosemary on the smash fries are really good. Nice touch. Very fresh food."}
{"text":"If I want the best burger and fries I can get for under $10 this is the place!!!  I love their AZ burger with the habanero bun and fresh jalapeños.  Sweet potatoes fries are nice too.  If you haven't been here yet and you like a good burger you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I only have great things to say about this place!  I've been here multiple times and the staff is super friendly and helpful with everyone.  They go out of their way to help with getting us a kids seat too.  The prices are what you would expect for a good burger place and food is phenomenal.  I like the AZ burger and their sweet potato fries are great.  This is probably my favorite burger chain in the valley."}
{"text":"Excellente! Definitely worth checking out.  Their salads are great, too!

Oh, and I did list \"outdoor seating\" but really it's just the curb out front, and you have all of these cars driving by, so it's not really all that comfortable...unless you like the smell of exhaust fumes, that is. ;)"}
{"text":"After having bachi burger a few days ago I've been craving it ever since.  Since its a bit far for me i decided to compromise and go for smash burger because i remember it being fairly decent last time i went.

Got the sin city burger with smash fries this time.  The burger was decent, the onions were grilled nicely and had a lot of flavor but for some reason the burger just wasn't satisfying.   

The smash fries were way too weak on the garlic and it was extremely greasy.  There was an actual puddle oil/grease at the bottom which was pretty disgusting.

Overall, I left with a gross oily after taste and will probably be burping up grease for the rest of the night.

To finish my burger obsession for the weak I gota compare this place to fuddruckers and then the fukuburger truck.  Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. The first time, I came here, the food was fine and the service was very decent. Today, I decided to preorder my meal, so I put my order in 30 minutes beforehand. When I got there, my order was just received, so I had to wait another ten minutes. The cashier gave me a free drink for my wait. While I was waiting near the pick up area, I hear two employees arguing with each other. When my food was ready, I took it home to eat. The burger had an excess amount of grease that it nearly soaked up the entire wrapping: same with the fries. My order was wrong, I asked for no pickles and mustard. The meat was falling apart, undercooked and salty. If you crave smash burger one day, I recommend trying a different location."}
{"text":"Well  ???  Hubby & I have been eating here at least once a month since they opened.  The manager or head waiter was fantastic.  Saw him all the time when we would stop by to have lunch on our way to our second shift employment.  Last visit was in mid May 2018.  Everything was different.  No recognizable staff.  And there was this BIG slovenly, sloppy guy with a chick running in and out of the kitchen area.  He looked like he was wearing pajamas. They were not attired in clothing like the cashier or servers.  Just super nasty and unprofessional.  We have unsubscribed from the Smashburger email and will never eat there nor recommend them to anyone.  YUK."}
{"text":"I was really up on this place when it first opened - great hamburger. But I have to say that it has progressively really gone downhill fast. I have eaten here at least a half a dozen times now and it gets worse every time. The biggest problem is the service. The cashiers and servers seem completely disconnected and disinterested. Twice our food sat in the window waiting while the workers were simply screwing around and not paying attention. I'm not sure what they are paying their help but they should think of upping the wage to get some qualified people. Pretty sad. Not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I had seen this place a number of times, and finally decided to go in and see what they had to offer. I'm glad I did! The Sin City burger (1/2lb size) and Smash fries are GREAT! Good service, good food, friendly staff...I'm a regular now!"}
{"text":"For a fast food burger, this is a great place. Order the onion strings and put a healthy bundle on top of your burger!"}
{"text":"My husband had been raving about these burgers so convinced me to go for an early dinner. Selection was great and ordering efficient. Being that it was early it wasn't too busy. I ordered a classic, fries and a chocolate shake. We sat down and the burgers and fries came out quickly. Fries were not very warm, burger was tasty but a little underseasoned. Still no shake. The people next to us complained to a busboy that they too were waiting on shakes. The cashier is the same person making the shakes and she was busy taking orders. Our neighbors got their shakes when they were finished their meal. Finally my husband went up to check on my shake. The cashier forgot and now she was out of ice cream. He asked for another flavor then and she said she was out of all ice cream. At 5pm on a Friday night?!?
We were refunded for the shake and went on our way. Pretty apathetic service and just mediocre food. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"As mentioned before - excellent food portions (received ample toppings on my Smashchicken Avocado Club and Arizona Smashburger) and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Excellent food portions - great customer service!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, quick service.  I would give it five stars, however that last star is reserved for my favorite burger joint which is fat burger.  Have not found a location with a better burger but this place is close.  


Ryan's stamp of approval."}
{"text":"This place is great! I loved the burger and fries and thought the location of this store was awesome! The food was quick and great! Not to mention, I had a coupon which made it all the better!"}
{"text":"This must be Smashburger lite. More money less food, longer wait. Couldn't be more disappointed in one of my favorite burger places. Smash fries weren't like any smash fries I have ever purchased, the image on their display looks like the fries I usually receive but these were much smaller and in a very tiny container. I ordered a double cheeseburger and received a double burger with no cheese. Yes I did order a milkshake and yes I know that shouldn't be on my diet but I love their milkshakes. I think the guy making milkshakes thought it shouldn't be on my diet either because he gave me a half milkshake. Yes the 16oz cup was about half full. When you come to Phoenix eat at Chelsea's kitchen not Smashburger. I love Smashburger just not this one."}
{"text":"Love their chicken bacon avocado sandwich- full of flavor and not overly greasy. You can order it grilled, and it's not rubbery or artificial tasting. Sweet potato fries are on point too- would like to try the smashed fries next time around with rosemary seasoning $2.29. They do charge like $1.50 extra to add avocado and bacon and other extras to sandwiches. Very quick service- was there less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Like others have said, the burgers are really greasy.  They leave a greasy film all over the place.  The smash fries were mediocre at bes, the fired pickles we decent.  I asked numerous times when ordering that I wanted CRISPY bacon.  Of course the bacon was anything but crispy.  The grilled onions were greasy as well.  Create a Burger was better, but for equivalent money I prefer to go to Red Robin.  If you haven't tried them yet, then get to Tommy's and In-n-Out."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews of this recently opened business, the first Smashburger in Pittsburgh, by the way.  Also, I did attend the pre-opening Yelp Elite event so wanted to revisit on a normal business day.

I was especially curious to see what the staff would be like after having read all the negative reviews regarding them and seeing how they were very awkward at the pre-opening event.

Well, I can say that they were polite on this visit, especially so (I was even asked if everything was ok when leaving).  I can also say, What the? on the number of staff no matter what and especially relative to the number of clientele.  It was a Friday evening about 5:30pm.  There were 6 staff in the kitchen and 7 on the floor.  Count them -- 13.  Number of customers?  Maybe 15?  Please do explain that?  Were some training others?  If so, it was not apparent.  

Anyway, they were polite, if not necessarily all that efficient.  Not all 13 could possibly be busy at once.  My order arrived at the table long before my husband's.  That's kinda irksome.  We would like to dine together.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with goat cheese and spinach, the same sandwich I fell in love with at the Yelp event.  It is a wonderfully tasty sandwich and I highly recommend.  I ordered a side salad to go with it and was satisfied with it, as well.  My husband ordered a crispy chicken sandwich (so why on earth did it take so long compared to mine, I'll never know).  He said it was fine.  

On another note, When ordering to dine in, you will be handed a plastic cup (not a to-go) cup. So, you can refill all you want in the dining room, just won't be able to take it with you.  

Pros:  Taste:  Very good for the chicken.  The burgers I sampled at the Yelp event were good, but not stellar for the price.  

Cons:  Price:  Way too expensive for a fast-food place.  My chicken sandwich was 6.99 all by itself.  The side salad was 2.99.  the fountain drink was 1.99.  12.00 for a meal.  

Recommendation:  Get the grilled chicken with goat cheese and spinach.  And, ask for to-go even if you're dining in to get a to-go cup so you can refill one last time before leaving.  But for the best burger experience, keep on looking at that price."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here Friday night and we had the create your own (cyo)  and I have to say that it was really good. My husband is not a person who likes  but he said that he actually enjoyed his. The fries we good as well since we had them to prepare them fresh for us. The only issue I had with this place is that they we were slow other than that it was great. The young lady that took our order was very pleasant and smiling and the other employees seem to be ok as well. I will definitely be back when in the mood for a  and ."}
{"text":"It's a little bit on the expensive side when you bring the whole family out for burgers but it's worth it. Sweet potatoe fries are the best and the mushroom burger is my favorite. The sauce on it what makes it really tasty so ask for extra."}
{"text":"Good burgers and interesting tasty skinny \"smash fries\" with rosemary and garlic. I enjoyed the avocado club burger with bacon and ranch on a whole grain bun- one they highly recommended . Definitely much better than your average fast food burger and you can truly customize your burger any which way you want- also a plus. Why Four stars and not Five? Its just good simple food"}
{"text":"Veggie burger was FANTASTIC. They really do mean smashed though. haha The manager was really nice and came to check on us during our meal. Staff was friendly, food was really good. I would suggest the onion rings- nice and thin."}
{"text":"The food is always good there. The fries are always fresh and the milkshakes are great.  But I continue to go back because of the customer service. The people that work there are always so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"My feelings of smashburger: Meh. 

First visit: It went okay. It was close to closing, I was able to order and get out within a decent time.

I thought the avocado burger on multigrain bun tasted good. The smash sweet potato fries were just okay... didn't get the full effect because when I got home and unpacked the food, it seemed like the topping was everywhere but on the fries. The salted caramel shake tasted pretty good, but was small.

Second visit: Ehh. It was around noon. Only one register open, that was frustrating because it seemed like it took forever to place my order.

I got the standard smashburger but with grilled chicken. I had a free side so I went with smashtots. Tots were ok, just tots to me. Chicken breast was ok, just odd that it was paper thin.

Can get pretty pricey pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I visited this Smashburger for the second time.  The first visit was great, but this one was not.  I ordered the Arizona burger with no jalapenos, to go.  It took them about 10 minutes to get me the burger, which was fine.  I waited til I got home to open it.  It was overcooked and fairly dry.  It was kind of crusty around the edges.  The menu say that it comes with habanero cheese, but there was no cheese at all on the burger.  I went to the Smashburger website to provide feedback, but the feedback link didn't work.  This was a thoroughly unsatisfying experience."}
{"text":"This particular Smashburger is in a casino food court, so my expectations were not that high. For a burger, it isn't a bad stop to make. But let's focus on Smashburger's real success: the Smash Fries. 

Smash Fries are thin cut crispy fries. But they aren't your average fries. They are flavored with olive oil and rosemary and it absolutely changed the way I enjoyed fries before. The rosemary adds a great refreshing flavor! Need I say more? Go to Smashburger and order up some Smash Fries."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous. I don't know what happened here, but after years of burger perfection, this place has inexplicably taken a sharp nosedive. Our last visit was so bad, I don't know where to start. 

We ordered 1 regular size jalapeño Baja, 1 large size jalapeño Baja and a smash fries. Simple enough right? Well, it took over 23 minutes to be served and both burgers arrived identical in size, despite the server announcing \"and the large is for who?\". After 23 minutes, we didn't care. Whatever. Then we noticed the buns had inexplicably shrunk in size. For some reason, the buns looked like slider buns with the meat protruding about 1-2 inches all around. Very skimpy and strange. Oh well... when you're hungry you overlook these things and start eating anyways.   Unfortunately though, the meat patties tasted like they had been coated in salt for a week. I've never tasted anything so salty in my life. It was my sodium allowance for the week in 1 bite. Unbelievable. We both couldn't finish our burgers they were so salty... and with those silly little mini-buns! What a disaster.

Anyways, I know it's fast food and we need to temper our expectations but nevertheless this was beyond bad. I never thought I would say this, but I would rather eat McDonalds. And that's saying a lot. 

Too bad. We really loved Smashburger. And now we will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Check it out, burger fans, there is a new game in town (or at least, there will be tomorrow, when they officially open for business).  Like Erin and a few others, we scored an invite to the Smashburger sneak peek, and were rewarded with a ton of food.  It was the opportunity to try literally everything on the menu.  We actually had to stop because we had no more room.  I felt like Adam Richman, and here food won the battle.

Speaking of said food...

The burger is clearly the star of the menu.  They are nice and greasy.  There are six basic options that come pre-configured, and you can also create your own.  The primary issue I had is that they are a bit pricey and go down way too easily.  I could probably eat at least two at a sitting, so it could get expensive fast.  Also the meat is a bit \"smashed\".  Smashed?  That just means that the meat does not stand out much from the other flavors.

Do make sure you flip the menu to the back - something I completely missed the first time around.  While the place is called \"Smashburger\", the back of the menu just might be the stronger, because it holds the chicken sandwiches (available grilled or crispy), salads and shakes.

For those wondering, the regular chicken probably will not hold up against Chick-Fil-A.  But the Buffalo sandwich, made with Frank's and blue cheese?  It kills the Chick-Fil-A spicy, and may just be the best sandwich in the place.  It was at least the best one I tried (I tried at least four).  Like the burgers, there are a handful of pre-made selections or you can build your own.

All our veg friends should not fret, as there are plenty of options, and not just sides like at many other places.  There are of course fries (made from both normal and sweet potatoes, in multiple configurations), as well as fried pickles, onion strings and veggie frites, but unusual in a fast casual restaurant, a solid array of salads too, both a small size for a side and several selections for your main dish.  Still not your speed?  There is even a black bean burger and the kids menu has a grilled cheese.

Do not miss out on the shakes.  Made from Haagen-Dazs ice cream, they are well worth your time.  You can get standard chocolate, strawberry and vanilla, or go a bit crazy and try banana pudding, butterfinger, nutter butter or oreo.  I actually preferred the standard, as though the flavors were good all around, the chunks in the specialty shakes were hard to get up through the straw.  But whatever works.  You can also get bottled soda floats made with IBC, Sun Drop or Cheerwine.

One huge misfire?  Their burger and chicken have BBQ sauce, there is Brunswick Stew, but there was no sweet tea to be found.  If you are of age, you can get either beer or wine, which helps, and the shakes are tasty.  But no sweet tea?  For shame!

Edit:
Word on the street is that there is indeed sweet tea - but when we were there for the sneak peak on Saturday, it was sadly MIA.  Hopefully it is out in abundance now!

{"text":"Are you kidding me? Love Smashburger! My go-to is the Carolina Chili Burger and man is it great! I always order buffalo style fries as well. They load you up with fries let me tell you. The portion size is insane. Shakes are great as well, I've only had vanilla but can tell you it is very good. Service is super fast and everyone has been friendly to me after already going a couple dozen times (too much maybe?). This is one of my regular lunch or dinner spots and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good burger. No clue why this place doesn't have 5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Amazing. Just a darn good burger. Got the Arizona, pulled off half the jalapenos, de-lish! Great service, manager was very nice and makes sure Military is discounted all the time. The place is clean and comfortable. The smash fries are so so, not my thing, but I am glad I tried them. Going here will not save your soul, but you'll be glad you tried it."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at this chain before. But I think they could give In & Out a run for their money, especially in Bakersfield where it takes 30 minutes to get in and out (Stockdale location). The burgers are very fresh, and it is nice that they make any one of them in three
versions sizewise. I did not think too much of the tiny \"shoestring\" fries, but they grew on me.
The Frank's fries and Smash fries were very good. People were very nice too."}
{"text":"I have to downgrade my review of this Smashburger location after my last visit. It's not hard to make sweet potato smash fries but this location has found a great way to mess them up. On my last visit the fries that were brought to the table were swimming in grease. And when I say swimming, we're talking a pool of oil and grease that was almost 3 stacked fries deep in the bottom, and let me tell you the few fries that I found that were not coated with their soggy oil were nasty enough that I spit them out. 

When I go somewhere and end up spitting out my food, that warrants an immediate Star drop. While the Spicy Jalapeno Chicken was just as good as ever...the fries were an absolute disgrace and should have never left the back to be served to a customer. 

2 Stars. I will go back...but I hope I never see a pile of fries swimming in that much oil and grease ever again. Nasty, nasty, nasty. Bleech. I hope someone in corporate sees this and takes the time to ask what in the heck happened as this is NOT the Smashburger experience that I've come to expect. Far from it."}
{"text":"If you want cheap and good you walk next door to In-N-Out. If you want something a little bit fancier but very good like guacamole on your burger or sweet potato fries you come here. 

My first impression was kinda ho hum as they were slow to get to the counter and take my order. And their fountain drinks were kinda flat and not mixed properly. But the food more than offset that. I loved my Spicy Baja burger and sweet potato smashfries. So much so that I am looking forward to coming back and having them again. They were really good!

When it comes to my list of hamburger places in Vegas that are fast and reasonably priced Smashburger in one visit catapulted itself to the top of my list. I like Smashburger! And I will be back!"}
{"text":"Manager went above and beyond to help us.  The food is good and atmosphere is nice.

Kristin & Jeff"}
{"text":"It's pricey as fuck, no complete fucking meals, ordering shit on the side makes me feel like a fat motherfucker. There's a dude named Shannon and he looks at me as I eat my hamburger and I look at him at he has a boner growing in his pants. No I'm kidding but he might as well have one the way he kept looking at our general direction, now theres nothing wrong with it, but don't play that gay stuff now. Food is okay, french fries are thin as fuck an little to no taste at all. It was empty as fuck in there cause In-N-Out is right next door. You should go to In-N-Out. Employees at In-N-Out work about 3 TIMES as harder in one shift than Shannon does in a week."}
{"text":"We have had multiple positive experiences at this location.  It's small but it is well-maintained and the food is good!  The entire family enjoys their meals here and it's good that there are some healthier options.  The staff we've encountered here have always been friendly and helpful.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Ok ... I am a burger fanatic ... I've had great and not so great burgers on a few continents and several countries. This one fits into the category of a marginally upscale fast food burger, not too bad and not so outstanding. The one thing they do really well is their bun. The \"smashed\" burger is \"cooked to government standards\" and not a bit of pink remains. I like more medium rare or even medium and the well done characteristics are just not as tasty to me.
Had the sweet potato fries with it and they were served in a waxed paper cone that kept all the fat and oil on the fries.
The cashier for our visit was a young girl who spoke way to fast and we missed a couple of minor points that would have enhanced our visit.
The sad truth is that this is one place \"I don't need to go again\" instead of a \"give it another shot\" ... too bad for them."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite with the family. Got in right before a big crowd..was very impressed with how cashier Devin kept her composure. Asked guest after us to give her a moment. Know it's easy to get stressed when it's busy. Actually got our food in under 15 mins. Burgers and fries we delicious as always. My little one dropped top of her bun..but another worker Anthony got us another. Was impressed with all of the staff's friendly service. Between the great food and service was an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Great food, clean place, you couldn't ask for much more, oh and friendly staff! I came in and forgot my wallet, even though I was cranky the held the order while I could run home. My daughter and wife went back because I wasn't feeling good, they gave them the order and even gave them a discount. I have been back many times now, and love it!"}
{"text":"First time here.    Trying the Arizonan.  -  AFTER THE BURGER... Not AMAZING, but the burger was something I am glad I tried.  It was made with care and the food was fresh.  I was not a fan of the wire food trays, but it was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Yeah. Two stars.

This place should be great. It has all the makings for an amazing burger joint. But it's just ok. There are tasty bits in there somewhere, but it's overall not that good. I love cheeseburgers. LOVE. I don't even remember mine except for that it came open-faced, which pisses me off. Yes. I get that much emotion from an open burger. I don't like to go out and order food, and then still have to put work into it before I eat it. Especially if it's still gonna taste average.

Bottom line, if you're gonna have the balls to put a burger joint next to In-N-Out, it better be phenomenal. Smashburger is NOT phenomenal."}
{"text":"SMASH! CRASH! BIFF! BAFF! POW!

Those are the sounds I imagine would be coming out of the kitchen if a super hero were making my burger. While that's not the case at Smashburger, they do a decent job of it nonetheless and while I won't claim it as the very best burger I've tasted in Calgary, I will go so far as to say it does deserve the 4 star rating I'm giving in. Especially when you put those spicy peppers on top and they live up to the spice promised in the name of the Spicy Baja Burger (pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and fresh jalapeños on a spicy chipotle bun).

If you haven't sauntered into Smashburger yet, there's one thing you should know. There are no combos here. Everything is ordered separately... so, burger, side, drink. Just burger. Burger and side. Side and drink. Burger and drink. Side only. Drink only. You get the picture. I went for Spicy Baja Burger, side of deep fried pickles and an iced tea. Do get the deep fried pickles. They're kind of awesome. If you're staying, you'll get an order number and your burger will be brought out to your table when it's ready. If you're going, there's only one itty, bitty little bench for two up near the counter for you to wait at. But if it isn't too busy, there's a row of tables just next to this you can use as well.

One option I haven't tried on the menu yet is the opportunity to create my own burger. There are a TON of toppings to choose from. I'm imagining it now... Big Smash on a classic egg bun with spicy chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, cucumbers, aged swiss cheese. Side of mushroom poutine (unfortunately, mushrooms are not an option on the build your own or I'd be all over that! But, we can make that up with the poutine). Ugh... I need to jump on the treadmill just thinking about it. 

Anyway, if you're in the 'hood and jonesin' for your burger fix, skip the other fast food joints just a bit of the road and come here instead where you can be sure your burger is made-to-order, made of real meat (or black bean if you opted for the vegetarian burger) and doesn't leave you feeling like you've just eating a lump of food that's going to sit in the pit of your stomach for the next 10 years while it digests. Instead, it's tasty, it's almost as fast and the patties aren't flash frozen or left in any warming trays. 

Sorry kids, for the time being, I don't see any gluten free options on the menu."}
{"text":"Had the classic Cobb salad. Very tasty with fresh ingredients. Also the manager (Amanda) took our order and she was awesome! She was really helpful, made good recommendations and even gave us a little discount for being new customers!!"}
{"text":"this place is only rivaled by five guys as a burger joint. everything is fresh, and the milkshakes are nothing short of amazing, they're a meal in and of themselves though."}

Only one person the run the cash register and run food at lunch rush.

Almost every time I'm here I watch more people get frustrated and leave than I see people actually wait it out and order food."}

{"text":"Normally Smashburger is awesome!! This time was a let down. The bathrooms were gross and the fryer was broken so my first chicken sandwich was burnt and had to be remade. The one I got was burnt on the outside and almost raw on the inside. Sorry Smashburger! You need to step up your game at this location so I can keep coming back. Luckily I already know Smashburger and am a fan but if this was my first time I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The greatest burgers in all of Calgary. Very cheap price for what you, extremely customizable. I'm not a big fan of veggies, but they have a tom of sauces/other stuff that makes the meals worth your money. 5 STAR FOR U!"}
{"text":"Super, super slow service. Saving money on labor and screwing the guest over with slow service is a bad business model."}
{"text":"FRIED PICKLES.

I don't know why this is a secret, but Smashburger has fried pickles and I enjoyed them very much. PSA over

The food was great as usual, but the wait was horrendous. There was a line the whole time we were there but the restaurant wasn't full. It took us about 30-40 minutes from getting in line and then sitting and waiting for us to get our food. Luckily there were no issues when it arrived, but we were really hungry :(

It seemed like they were very short staff, sometimes there would be no one taking orders because someone would have to run to the back to help deliver food. I will probably give them another try but based on other locations I've been to, the service was not up to par."}
{"text":"My heart sank when I saw the reviews say that they have fried pickles. Why didn't I know this? Why didn't anyone tell me? Why haven't I seen them on the menu? :(

I only recently tried Smashburger and am a fan. I brought some friends here a few weeks ago and they liked their burgers. I've only gotten the Arizona Chicken burger with smashfries, but I want to try a burger sometime soon. The manager is super friendly and the service has been great when I visit."}
{"text":"Smashburger is one of those places that I'd always wanted to try but just got around to it last week. There is a location close to my office so I grabbed some lunch for a couple of people. I picked up a couple of burgers and for myself got the Arizona Chicken burger with smash fries. It held up by the time I got to my office and sat down to eat. There is a lot of heat in this sandwich, which is what I was looking for so I was very pleased. I also really liked the smash fries, nice and crispy and nice seasoning. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've tried the burgers, fríes, rosemary fries, sweet potato fries and salad. I have been here a few times since they open this location and the store/tables/counter have been clean and neat every time. The food has good taste and the burgers are good sized , even the small size burger has enough meat to bite into it and get the taste and flavors. The staff at this store smile and treat you well. I've seen the staff go around the tables checking on customers to see if they needed anything more. I continue to return to this establishment often when I want a burger."}
{"text":"Located near the theatre entrance. 1st time here and I enjoyed the quick service. Very casual. I liked my dinner.
Ordered:
Bacon and Cheese Burger
Sweet Potato Fries
My friends thoroughly enjoyed having a milkshake or beer with their burgers."}
{"text":"I love this Smash Burger  I usually get the mushroom and Swiss burger with their specialty fries on the side. I also get the kids meal with grilled chicken breasts, apple sauce pouch, and chocolate milk. My son seemed to really enjoy his meal so that's all that matters to me! Although, i think their burgers are a little on the pricey side, but worth it if you're in the mood for a juicy-tasty burger! Last but not least, I get their salted caramel malt and butterfinger malt, they're both to die for!!! Service is always good and when they bring the food out, they usually ask if we need anything else. Staff is always nice and I always see their manager Brandon there!"}
{"text":"I mean I just love their truffle mushroom Swiss burger, it's just so yummy! I usually go for the regular size with their smash fries topped with rosemary! And to add that, I also get their salted caramel malt. I went to this location & the order didn't take too long to make which was great & the staff was nice as well. Great burgers & shakes, you'll be seeing me come more often when I'm in that side of town!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Smashburger a 5-star rating primarily for the quality of service I received when eating there recently for my first time. The guy working the register was friendly, and when I was 77 cents short he covered it for me, thus saving me a trip back to the car and another hit on my debit card. The girl who brought us our food was also very hospitable, getting me several condiments for my fries, and even suggesting I try their chipotle sauce (which I did, and it was decent). She also offered to get me a to-go cup for my drink when she noticed we were finished with our meals. It's rare, especially these days, to feel like the employees actually enjoy their jobs and take pride in making sure that the customer has a good experience. 

As for the food, I got a 1/2lb BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and it was pretty damn good. Reminded me of a Fuddrucker's burger moreso than, say, In'n'Out or Five Guys, definitely a little different than the norm when it comes to burger joints. I had the Smash Fries, which I thought were delicious with the seasoning they used.

If you are looking for a burger but you're sick of the norm, give Smashburger a try, you might just be pleasantly surprised as I was."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service - messed up the order (which has happened before) and took about 20 minutes to correct (which has happened before).  Meanwhile everyone else had finished their meal.
Puddle of liquid in the hot dog container - watery grease, urine?  I don't know.
Burgers (three out of four) were not centered on the bun.  Sound nitpicky? Basically needed a shower afterwards.

Seriously, their burgers are not great, their prices are not competitive, their service is poor.  Lesson learned for me: Be desperate for disappointment if I ever want to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing burger, although a bit pricey keeping in mind that in and out burger is nearby. Overall experience was good and would come back."}
{"text":"Yes and yes and yes.  GOOD burger. Straight from the menu or build it as you want it.  Try the Smash fries with it!   I'll be back for one of the Smash dogs...  we left full and happy."}
{"text":"I think the burgers taste pretty good, and the egg bun makes it special. The fries are super greasy and overcooked though."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  Aside from Tacos lol Burgers are one of my favorites.  

It was my first time trying Smash Burger and I'm hooked.  I ordered the BBQ Bacon and it was simple yet perfectly executed.  Nothing crazy which is what makes a great burger in my book.  

Now while the burger was great my favorite part of the meal was the String Fries.  Can I get an AMEN!! They were crispy and well seasoned.  What more could I ask for.  

Can't wait to go back and try something else along with a shake."}
{"text":"I am a burger fan. And this is a good one. It is not too expensive for what you get and the flavors are what I expect out of my food. Buns are fresh and soft, cheese is real cheddar."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to get a quick bite before leaving and I was not disappointed!  I had the Breakfast Burger.  It was amazing!  The burger was fresh, not frozen and oh so juicy!  The egg and bacon was just enough flavor to complement the burger.  The portion was just right for a breakfast meal.  If/when I come back to Las Vegas, I definitely will make this a stop!"}
{"text":"I think my 7 year old son said it best....Dad your homemade burgers and fries are better and cheaper than this, and they even forgot the bacon on my burger. I had tried smashburger once before and was not impressed tried it today because I had a coupon. The food was average and the staff seemed unorganized and looked kind of creepy. Really turned my stomach to see people in the kitchen area without hair nets or anything to cover their hair. The experience got even worse when I saw people in the kitchen touching their face and running their hands through their hair, could not see if their was a place in the kitchen to wash hands although what I saw really bothered me.....Smashburger all hype no substance"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out for quite a while.  I finally had a chance to go and get a classic Smashburger.  When I first walked in I was presently surprised with the modern decor!  Large HDTV's for the menu, modern dining room.  I thought it was all great.  When I got my burger I was disappointed by how messy it was.  

Also, the portion of fires you get are a bit disappointing.  

Other then that, Smashburger is a great burger joint."}
{"text":"Still love the food but wanted to give a shout out to whomever is training your staff here.  You have the right formula and your staff members are taking care of customers.  Recent experience with Shift Leader Leah was excellent, very accommodating and friendly.  Thanks for making my visit a pleasant one and ensuring that I will be back!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is my second favorite quick serve hamburger (after Five Guys). Their burgers are always great. Good milkshakes (even better than Five Guys) and this one is no different. We ate here and the hamburgers were perfect...as usual."}
{"text":"I had never been to Smash Burger, prior to this visit. 
I can't believe how fast we got our food!!! 
The restaurant was kept very clean.
The person who brought our food to us was great. We asked for a few extra items, and he did so with a smile and was fast and friendly.
We saw him tending to other guests and cleaning tables. 
it's obvious that the employees take ownership of their store and take care of it.
Amazing fresh and fast food and service!!
Thanks to you all at this location"}
{"text":"Great healthy yummy burgers! Never knew burgers could be healthy but smashburger changed my mind! I love how the buns are multigrain and the ingredients are so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Regular retail price $25. Paid $14. Joined the Smash Burger email club and got a free burger then got a free shake on my birthday  I did two transactions in order to use both coupons. The fried pickles were a little salty but they were super fresh! My dinner buddy said the shake tasted weird but I didn't find anything wrong with it, more shake for me! This place is pricey without coupons though, something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"The name draws you in, it allures you to get a better understanding of just what is a \"smashburger\"?  One thing you know pretty much before you take one step inside this small burger chain,  you're gonna like your meal. There's something salivating about smashing ingredients onto or into a fresh juicy all beef patty. 

Upon entering a smashburger it's clear that is ain't your typical burger joint.  Don't expect any mind altering experience, like Dorthy had upon arriving in the land of munchkins and the yellow brick road, but certainly not the homogeneous looks of the big chains of McD's, BKing, Jacks ( formerly known as jack in the box) Karl's Jr, Wendy's, Taco Bell and others that dominate this resturant category.  Simple typography of classic burger ingredients don the walls and a pleasant combination of Maroon, natural wood, Browns and wine color palette slowly come to focus revealing snippets of other menu items available.  While the typical layout of tables, ordering counter and soda fountain machine gently remind you that this is still a \"fast food\" establishment. 

But onto the main stage:  How's the food?
Take one part great FRESH food and FRESH INGREDIENTS and one part creative-takes-on-classics and smash them together!  You end up with a meal that somehow gets into you belly faster than you expected and well before you realize you remember to savor the last few bites.   Smash sweet potato fries add a perfect compliment to more than 90% of the menu. Hand made to order shakes available in the classic Chocolate, vanilla strawberry flavored and these are not the only choices.  Other mouthwatering favors include salted caramel, Oreo blend, and seasonal flavors.   

Food is delivered by onsite employees and on metal baskets with smashburger branded parchment paper. 

Overall, this place rocks and definitely has raised the bar on what quality fast food can be.  They smashed more than food, they smash the competition into the chuck ground."}
{"text":"I'm still trying to feel out Smashburger.  The first time I went there, I had the Spicy Baja (pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo, jalapenos, chipotle bun).  The guacamole was the dominant flavor (which probably hid any spiciness that was there), with everything else blending together that in the end made for a burger with a flavor crisis.  I also had the Smashfries (tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic), which didn't leave much of an impression on me.  Fries with a very mild garlic flavor, nothing special.  After that meal I didn't really feel the urge to go back.

Until tonight.  Why did I end up here?  I really, really wanted a tasty burger; Smashburger was my second choice.  My first choice was Slider Truck behind Yogurtland with a really long line despite only being there for 20 minutes.  Me being hungry and not wanting to wait in line, I headed down Fort Apache to this Smashburger.  This time I had the 1/2 lb Sin City Smashburger ($6.99, fried egg, bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions, smash sauce, egg bun), no fries.  So with this experience, it was out with the guac and in with the salt.  Not to the point that makes it inedible, but enough to keep it noticeable as you keep eating.  The fried egg and onions definitely led to a good combination of flavors that satisfied my burger needs.

Would I come back here?  I would, but I wouldn't go back for the two burgers I've already had.  Hopefully I can find a burger that is a bit more balanced with the toppings, since the beef is good.  Three stars until I find that burger.

{"text":"This sits at a strong 3.5 but mainly for the service. Everyone was so courteous, I almost felt bad for not liking the food.

The last time I had Smashburger was back in my college days and I remember the smash fries being phenomenal but I just never went back since I left Tempe. Lo and behold, a Smashburger in my neck of the woods. Plus a free entree with a purchase of a side and drinks if you download their app? Well, guess where I'm going. 

The food's greasy. I'm okay with greasy if it's good (ie. Rehab Burger). But if the food's just okay, that grease ain't worth it. The burger buns were small, the sweet potato smash fries didn't taste any different from regular sweet potato fries, in my opinion and the burger was just okay. The service was really good though!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SMASHBURGER!
Their burgers and fries are simply the best! I've eaten at several around the valley and they have all been consistent with each other in food quality and kind service. The food is always fresh, the fries always done to perfections (sweet potato & regular). I'm definitely hook. 
I take my teen boys wherever they want to go for their birthday dinner and this is usually their choice. I don't complain because it's so inexpensive compared to the places they use to request before Smashburger opened."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at any SmashBurger. The staff is always friendly, polite and courtesy. The manager that use to be at this location was always extremely nice as well. I encounter her at this location and the one on Fort Apache and Tropicana.

 Carrie helped me out today. She offer products that I ended up ordering. She greeted me when I walked in. She got my complicated order correct and I appreciate that. Her manager even came out to check if she needed any help. I just wanted to give Kudos to Carrie and your company. 
The salted caramel shakes are great. Don't forget to always add smash fries to you order. You cannot go wrong with Rosemary and garlic."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I's favorite burger place. It is super tasty, 15/10 recommend the smash fries"}
{"text":"This place is overrated and overpriced. The burger tastes fine but it's so small, even when you upgrade to a \"large\". Same with the fries. If you want a real artisanal burger go to Blacow burger down the street. And if you want a similar burger but save some money, go to Wendy's."}
{"text":"on line ordering does NOT work she said it too! left in a huff after waiting in line."}
{"text":"Took my fellow yelper advice and arrived at 11:40, got a table and took my time perusing through the menu before lining up just as it was starting to get busy!

Ordered a Canadian burger (incl bacon and cheese), and added spicy chipotle mayo to it (which wasn't all too spicy).... along with sweet potato smash fries (which comes with a side of dipping sauce).  Love that the patty is smashed flat, and that the burger was HOT of the grill & tasty... yup! a bit messy but that was from the sauce not from it falling apart.  Love that they have Good bun choices, and Good sauce choices.  

Compared to 5 guys I say it's more 'gourmet' e.g.  'smash fries' = tossed in olive oil and rosemary, and also toppings and sauces are as such. 
Fries are shoe string fries... and can also be ordered as a poutine.

FYI - smash sauce is just mustard, ketchup, mayo, relish, and lemon juice all mixed together - nothing too special

They have smash iced teas on the side. I tried all 3.  I liked the middle non sweetened one myself, the other 2 were slightly sweetened.

Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Long wait, Runs out of food. Poor management.  Waited in line 10 minutes.  Waited another 25 minutes for a togo order before they came out and said they were out of the item.  Didn't offer to expedite the order or anything.  Would have had to wait another 25 minutes.... Really?   Horrible staff and management."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good greasy burger, this is your place! Try the \"Sin City\" burger- the fried egg makes it extra special. I like the smash chicken, it's white meat so a nice lighter choice."}
{"text":"Good food when dining in.  Used the on-line order for myself and son using a gift card.  We ordered 4 items, only got 3.  (Seriously, how hard is it to bag 4 item?).  Food was barely warm and we picked it up within minutes of our selected pick up time.  Called them about missing item and they couldn't do anything because we used a gift card, unless we wanted to drive back.  Took down our name and said we would get a free side next time we are in...we'll see if that works out."}
{"text":"Was to tired too cook so went here the other night.  The staff is great; friendly and attentive.  The burger? Not so great.  Not medium rare as requested and kinda tasteless.  Will probably give it one more try just in case."}
{"text":"This Smashburger reminds me why I thought I didn't really like Smashburger until I tried the one at Tempe Marketplace and then encountered the pure bliss of the ASU location.

How, you ask, is this Smashburger different from the Smashburgers of joy and repletion? First, it lacks the large menu board placed where the line forms. The lighted board up behind the counter is barely readable when you're at the counter, with the result that people squint and dither and have no idea what they're doing. Despite the cheerfulness of the counter personnel, ordering starts on the wrong foot.

Second, there is something peculiar about the kitchen set-up. On the rare occasions when I've ordered take-out, it has taken forever (with eat-in people behind me served first) and that was apparently the case this time, as the clerks were apologizing to waiting take-out customers. The cluster of sulky people near the pop machines does not help the mood.

Third, the food is just okay. I mean, it's better than the Wendy's across the street, and I certainly whiffled it down; but now I get why people have been raving over The Stand.

Fourth, dear god, people, LET ME FINISH MY MEAL. I was attempting to work on a story at my laptop while eating. I was not taking an unduly long time over it, and the place had no lack of empty tables. Clerks were so thoroughly all over me, trying to clear my tray when I visibly wasn't done, that I checked my reflection to make sure a bad-hair day wasn't making me look homeless or something. 

I would NEVER eat-in at this location again, and only under dire conditions of hunger would I go to it again. Even though the food is decent, the experience is so fretful that it's not relaxing or pleasant."}
{"text":"GONE. Closed February 26, 2014.

Apparently reaching the peak of burger-fries-and-beer perfection meant it was too good for this world and had to close.

Let us all hum Don McLean's \"Vincent (Starry, Starry Night\") as we contemplate the burger goodness that was and wonder what to do for dinner in the College Avenue food-court strip. The Smashburger in Tempe Marketplace is still open, though."}
{"text":"Went in and order a Medium Size Smashberger with Chease & Bacon.  Price was $6.49 plus Tax and honestly the size of the patty was disappointing.

Honeslty for about half the price you can go to In - N - Out and get a Double Double that is so much bigger, better, and worth the price charged.

Had hear all these wonderful thing about SmashBerger, but it was a disappointment.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Well I guess I lucked out and came on a good night. It was pretty busy at 6 pm on a Friday night, which means that people like it enough to go there early. I thoroughly enjoyed my build-your-own chicken burger on which I got a ton of the veggies. It kind of fell apart since there were too many veggies, so I would recommend just choosing a couple. My husband really liked his b-y-o hamburger, too. It wasn't too greasy, but now we understand why it is called Smashburger. They literally smashed his burger to a pulp so it fell apart very easily. Got the smash fries which had a lot of olive oil on the top but not the bottom. Our chocolate malt was good but we got it about 10 minutes late since the runner girl gave ours to a different couple who came in after us. Boo. And when you deliver our food and I tell you that we are still waiting for our malt and you take 10 minutes to bring it out to me, that is not acceptable.  I expect it to be made ASAP since you already should have had it to me 10 minutes earlier. But that is just me being picky I guess."}
{"text":"Had Smashburger a few weeks ago with my coworker.  It was my first time having anything from there.  Not one of the best burgers I've had and certainly not in my top 5, but it was good.  So were the Smashfries. The cashier, Nancy was nice. Although the restaurant is small and was pretty busy considering it was noon, our food came out rather quickly."}
{"text":"I always end up ordering the same thing here....truffle mushroom Swiss chicken sandwich!! It's soo good! I had a nice big serving of chicken that was juicy and flavorful! Order it and you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I was displeased with the service that I got last week, so I contacted smash burger, and they immediately contacted me back and send me coupons. I ate there again today, and I was blown away by the service, and the absolute deliciousness of the burger! Thank you smash burger for being delicious and letting me believe in you again! And thank you for taking care of your customers. I appreciate you. I highly suggest you go here!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try something different. We should've stuck with what we knew. We didn't enjoy the food at all. I didn't like the cut of the fries. They were too sharp. We got the regular and the Olive Oil, Rosemary and Garlic fries and they were both disgusting. We hated them!

The burger was nothing to brag about. The flavor was decent, slightly salty. I got the large Bacon Cheeseburger and my friend ordered the Medium Size Bacon Cheeseburger. My friend was pissed because she thought the different sizes offered would add thickness, but the larger size was just wider and just as thin as the smaller size. The Applewood bacon on my burger was gummy. My friend's bacon was really small. I think they divided 1 slice into 3 different pieces on her's.

In all, to sum up my experience, I would say the place was mediocre. The place was dirty (EVERY table and also the drink station), the tea tasted like water and the food was average. The staff was friendly, but not friendly enough to make this experience any better than what it was.

I would not recommend this place and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love Brussel sprouts, so I ordered that as a side!  So, so, greasy!!  My gosh the oil soaked the brown bag.... absolutely too much grease!! Even when I've ordered fried chicken (different resturant altogether) it's NEVER been this greasy!! I have to say they were very good (just enough seasonings, great flavor), but if they are always this greasy they need to do something to soak up the extra grease!! The hamburger was also very good."}
{"text":"My husband tried a couple locations and told me he didn't taste the salt thing, so I figured I'd give them another chance. Even with \"light seasoning\" as my receipt claims, I still tasted mostly salt and grease. Seven hours later, it's still repeating on me. The burger also was quite thin, and definitely not worth $6.99 for a \"big\" size. Oh, and when you put a fried egg on a burger, you don't make it over hard... It's supposed to be over easy, idiots!

Guess this place goes into the trash heap along with In n' Out. People who eat at either of those places must not have functioning taste buds. :\"}
{"text":"Being a Vegas resident I have heard a ton of positive about SmashBurger.  Before I continue this review, I need to throw out the disclaimer that I have difficulty ripping friendly people.  SmashBurger was very friendly.

Experience starts by walking into an utterly confusing design with no one behind the counter, no one to be found.  I stare at the menu plastered above the cash register for 3 whole minutes before the girl working the counter arrives. I have no idea that everything is a la carte, I am college educated, and  I am betting this is not a reflection of my intelligence.

The girl working the counter (no name tag) is incredibly friendly, and apparently quite stressed over the very limited supply of customers in the restaurant.  I order \"The Classic Combo\" and am quickly informed that no such item exists in SmashBurger.  Obviously the girl working here has limited fast food experience because she proceeds to ask me item by item what I want.  We narrow it down, after some discussion, to a hamburger, fries, a drink.  Add chili.. what the hell.  I just drove 309 miles, lets splurge!!  Price is circa $10.50.  A bit stiff, but hey if the food is good, no biggy...

I get a plastic cup (noteworthy because this is the machine washable style, not the to go style) then take my seat at a table covered in filth.  This is the cleanest table I could find, however.  I am certainly not ADD, but I made 3 trips to the soda dispenser to wet napkins with water to wipe down the table.  I am being watched by employees the entire time.

Food arrives:  Burger looks pretty friggen awesome!  Chili is in a cup, coated in cheese.  No fries.  Long story short, she did not add fries to my order, extra $2.18.  Meal grand total now circa $13.  A bit high for a hamburger.  You aren't Ruth Chris.  After more discussion, I get fries ordered, they show up about 5 minutes later. 

The food:

Chili:  I love chili.  It will be the death of me.  This chili was very watery (I know, I should not have eaten it.  Everything in the last paragraph is my fault) and as the copious amounts of cheese melted it became very greasy.  I added a spoonful of chili to my hamburger and sampled the chili a few times until I realized my GI tract was preparing for war with me.

Hamburger: Excellent flavor.  Good job here.  Hard to mess this up, however, and not worth $10.  With the fluid drained chili that I put on it, it was pretty solid.  I may actually crave this item.

Better late than never French Fries:  Stiff, stale, no flavor.  I tried to dip them in chili for flavor, but it was watery to the point that they only came out brown, no real meat to them.  Doused in ketchup and salt, slightly tolerable.  Will not take this add on next time.

Service:  Very friendly.  The flighty girl working the counter was also apparently the server and expeditor.  Maybe they were short staffed today.  If not, horrible business plan.  When she is trying to get food out and to tables, people ordering are waiting. Likewise, when I can clearly see my food is ready and I am starving, I am waiting for an indecisive idiot to order.  This DOES NOT WORK!  

Will I be back?  Probably not.  Do I hate them and would I steer you away?  Not really.  They have decent food but....  they lack value and need operational help.  In the end, the only thing SmashBurger smashed was my colon.  My fault for eating the chili!"}
{"text":"Myself and my co-workers placed two online orders for pick-up today. We get back to work after picking the order up and half the order is missing. We go back to let them know and the Manager has an attitude about it. The Male Manager (didn't get his name) shouted at me and my Manager and said it was no ones fault about the mishap. Don't do online orders if you cant make sure that its accurate. The Manager was not apologetic at all. Didn't offer any coupons, a credit or anything. Keep in mind that we had to make two trips to get a correct order. I feel like the customer service is lacking. They in no way insured that I would e a continuous customer and they have lost our business."}
{"text":"I'm sad to have to write this review...I've been a Smashburger patron for years. This isn't my favorite location but it's close to work so I come here pretty often. Everyone has always been nice, place is clean, never any issues... Yesterday I got an email introducing their new Spicy Cowboy burger which looked darn good. The picture not only displayed the lovely burger but it detailed the ingredients as well. I called Smash, ordered this new burger to-go and it was ready for me right when I arrived. So far so good. Usually I drive straight back to work and eat my food... but this time I decided to sit outside on Smashburger's patio, and I'm glad I did. I ordered the large size, but mine seemed very anorexic. I took two bites and thought, this can't be the right burger. I recall several items listed on the advertisement that I'm just not tasting in my mouth. I pulled the email back up and noticed my burger was missing key ingredients, bacon and bbq sauce (how do you forget bacon on a bacon burger). I know it's a new burger, but if the picture in my email has the ingredients, I'm pretty sure they have it in the kitchen area. I went back in, went up to someone that looked like he had authority (he had a special red shirt on), explained the bacon was missing, he looked at me and said \"okaaaaay\" (kind of in a \"what do you want done\" type of tone). I was taken aback by that response. Then he said \"so do you just want bacon added on the burger?\"...seems the easy fix would be apologize for the mishap and make a new burger with all the ingredients...why are you asking me what should be done? I handed him my burger assuming they'd want to investigate to make sure I wasn't lying, and they proceeded to put bacon on my half eaten burger and gave it back to me. I asked \"did you put it back on my original burger?'...he said 'yes, did you want us to make you a new burger?\"...at this point my lunch break was running short and I didn't have time to wait for a new burger...I said \"no\" and left disappointed. I'm not so much upset over my burger being made incorrectly, mistakes happen. My annoyance is from how it was handled when I kindly brought it to their attention. Handing me back my original burger that was bit into was ugly. Smh."}
{"text":"I am home recuperating feeling sorry for myself.   But my lovely wife stopped by Smash Burger and brought me a FANTASTIC big burger with Avocado and bacon.   That was the best medicine I could been prescribed.   Juicy, flavorful. 
Perhaps the medical profession should take note.   ;-):-)"}
{"text":"I got a coupon at work that we decided to use right away. We ordered our food and the cashier was incredibly honest right from the start offering two free drinks due to long wait times because they are busy. Great customer service. This fltrend continued when they made one of our burgers wrong and gave us the right sandwich for free in addition to the two we already had. Outstanding job making up for the error. Also if you haven't been, the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I hate to be such a follower, but this place is 4 star worthy for sure.
Smashburger opened recently by my house and being such an in-n-out addict (see in-n-out review) I thought I might as well start reviewing other burger joints. This particular joint is located in a uber modern strip mally thing  on College and University I had never seen. I had to park across the street, down a side street, but its all good, it's so nice out. The joint is a minimalistic, classic burger joint style with modern flair. The menu is done up with many yummy, suped up fast food items like smashfries, which are gourmet-ish with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic. They have haystack onions and veggie frites for you health conscious fatties out there. They also have dogs and salads(?). Of course the real star is the plethora of burgers and toppings. They have a 1/3, 1/2 and chicken option for each burger and basic cheese and bacon and mushroom types. they also have a make your own with some good toppings, sauces, and buns. What's real fun is the menu for each state its in. I suppose they each have their own \"special\" burger. We, obviously, have an Arizona burger, which I *obviously* got, to go. (The Iowa burger on the website looks damn good too) The to-go box is so flippin cute! It's a lil chinese lookin take out box, specially made to fit my lil burger in. When I got home, I opened the lil package and saw a cute lil package of yumminess inside. The burger looked beautiful. the lettuce was springy, tomatoes were passable, jalapenos very fresh and spicy. red onions were my only complaint. There were a few all stacked up in the corner a'la how Mcd's does their pickles. The burger itself was very tasty, they must put special seasons in their meat, very nice. The bun was chipotle, pretty good. Overall, a very good, spicy burger that fits the Arizona name well. I will be back, those Haagen-Dazs shakes have my name all over em! (In n Out is still better tho, sry)"}
{"text":"Was in there on Memorial Day Sunday with my homie from Ventura, visiting parents...stopped there (against my better judgment) on our way back to Cali because we're not privileged enough to have a Smashburger in Ventura County and all was good. Restaurant was clean, food was tasty, despite it picking up businesswise while we were there no one waited for food and the manager/staff were interacting with customers and cleaning up what messes were made."}
{"text":"Arizona Smashburger is quite possibly the best burger I've ever had (including the ones I make at home). Smashfries are hit and miss (sometimes not that hot, sometimes too oily, sometimes over/under seasoned, rarely perfect...but when they are, oh MAN)...same thing with the haystack onions. But even when this location has a line out the door I find the service to be good and wait times minimal.

I should note that this fine establishment proudly serves Cherry Coke."}
{"text":"I've been to this Smash Burger five times now and every time I'm here my meal is delicious. I didn't give them five stars but their food deserves it because their food is really superior to other fast food burger restaurants. I like the clean feel of the restaurant. If anything keeps customers from coming here or it might be the price point it's just a touch higher than the competition. However, that doesn't really matter because the product you get here is really superior. If you're looking for an excellent burger, a choice of fries, and a shake this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this place. My husband and I used to come often but the quality has just gone down tremendously. We ordered togo on Saturday and I built my own chicken sandwich and added on avocado (an extra $1.50). One I got home, I opened the wrapper and whoever made the sandwich totally forgot the avocado until last minute so they threw a super small piece ON TOP of the bun like they just didn't even care! I was super disappointed and could barely finish my meal it just was blah. If you like how Smash used to be, then you won't like it now!"}
{"text":"I had specifically looked online to find a place that would have some good gluten free options.  The main website says that they have GF buns, and did NOT say it was only for some locations.  We were very unhappy to discover this location did not have GF buns.  The fries are good, but the prices are way too high, and the lack of the GF buns was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch..not terrible, they make a good burger. I had mine on a chipotle bun, may as well have been a regular bun, not very flavorful. The employees were talking really loudly at the counter, it was super annoying. I ate my burger and walked out, leaving sis behind to finish her fries. I seriously could not stand to be in there any longer than I had to..the vibe in there is just off. Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here experiencing a Smashburger. I wasn't sure what to order, the staff were helpful and explaining the process. It seems a little complicated at first, but I got it together the food was delicious, doesn't really seem out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviews, very heavy on the Salt, and whatever other spices they are putting in the meat (a lot of pepper too)but mostly the salt. I could hardly taste the meat. I ate at Several other Smashburgers and they were good, I would have remembered if they were anything like this. Whoever is mixing the meat and spices at this location is doing something wrong. I did get my food fast and the place was spotless."}
{"text":"What is the purpose of closing at a certain time and when you get there  10 minutes before 10pm doors are closed and employees pretend not to see you and worst people are inside eating."}
{"text":"Smashburger off Scottsdale Road is our go-to place! The burgers are always fresh and tasty! Whenever we have family in town from California, they always want to go!! The fries are bomb and we couldn't be happier with the service. Keep it up SB!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Emily was great as a counter person. The food was good and it didn't take long at all. I'll definitely be back to this location with our smartass. I got a build your own with nothing on it but cheese and pickles and my friend (TJ H on yelp) got a crispy ckicken."}
{"text":"Usually when you're starving everything is delicious. Well this wasn't. It was cold and a mess when I opened the wrapper. The smash fries were over seasoned and cold. I'll give them two stars for good customer service. I will not be back"}
{"text":"Ohhhh YESS. REALLY RAD... Cuz omg I can get.. THE ARIZONA BURGER which is the perfect level of SPICY YUM, a CHILI dog that's actually REALLY GOOD TOO (hard to come by) and if I want to go full hog, AWESOME FRIES. The staff and service are stellar, and the food is just wowww. The choice of buns, burgers, sizes etc is all really great, and the freshness factor is second to none. Great for a chain. Woo!"}
{"text":"If you are going to take it to go, i highly recommend you pre-order it online, which to go orders are online only, no over the phone orders anymore. Once you arrive to the restaurant, there is a separate shorter line for online orders. I used the 10% off Yelp discount. Even thought you pay for it online, they said the charge won't go thru until midnight, so its ok to put in your card number and then present your discount until you arrive. 

My favorite part about the burger is the bun, everything else is good too but not as great as the bun. You have to try the Smash Fries, they are their fries tossed in olive oil and rosemary."}
{"text":"I have to give them five stars for two reasons - first is the food - the food is great, and their black bean burgers are awesome.  The second reason is the staff itself - I was in one day and done an online order but found out later that I screwed up but they not only believed me but gave me my order and more free of charge because they felt they had done something wrong.  Few places treat the customers with integrity anymore and for that they get 5 stars and my continued business."}
{"text":"My burger was boring, the fried pickles are way salty and taste very much like vinegar. The ranch sauce to dip was meh. If you want great burgers and yummy variety have chee burger chee burger, but not here."}
{"text":"Smash burger is one of my favorite burger spots in Las Vegas. The Sin City Burger with a side of smash fires is my go to. I have never been let down or strayed by this order. The flavor of the tea here however is not the best. Usually get your food pretty quick and the shakes are excellent!"}
{"text":"Tried the Wedge Side Salad yesterday as I was craving some veggies. So delicious and fresh for $5! The blue cheese dressing, crumbles hike the calorie and fat count so you might want to ask for these on the side. Service as awesome as always. I wish their wifi was better. I marked it upscale as I think the ambience is compared to 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Smash burger is awesome!  How can you not love it, cooked to order fresh food!  They even made us some fried jalapenos which is not on their menu, but we had them at Smash in Texas.

The only bad experience we've had is a customer that went nuts and violently shoved an employee, it was scary!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service there was a small wait and the assistant manager Russell came out into the lobby and explained that 1 of his fryers were down and it would be a few more minutes he talked to us while we waited for our order and he was very professional and courteous (he offered a drink for the wait) I manage a restaurant myself and the service couldn't have been any better will definitely be back because of Russell"}
{"text":"I spent a day in Phoenix with low expectations of any good food as I am from California.  We came across Smashburger....the name intrigued us.  We ordered a chicken burger, vanilla milkshake and fried pickles.  

Beginning with the service and the facilities everyone was friendly and everything was clean.  Already happy to be there.  The food was amaaazing! The burger was packed with flavor, the milkshake was thick and yummy and the fried pickles were out of this world delicious.  It was my first time trying Smashburger and will look for it next time I'm in AZ.  Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the Fiesta area going on 2 years now . The only reason why I tried it because I received coupons  ( which were excellent). The burgers were very delicious, homemade, upscaled fast food. The guy Jeffrey and the other young lady the night of April 8th was very nice . I would definitely come back to this place . 

The line was not long, but it did take a while to order . I work in customer service and sometimes circumstances come up, so it didn't bother me. Keep up the great job you guys/ladies !!"}
{"text":"We had the Spicy Jalapeño Baja and the SinCIty burger. Both were delicious! Came with frys my fiancee had the regular and I had the Smash fries. The fries had a good flavor but where a bit thin for my liking. Our daughter had the hotdog and she ate it all as well as the apple sauce. Good quality food. Reasonably priced. Will return and bring other people. :)"}
{"text":"They charged us for 4 drinks even though we only asked for 3.  Then their ice machine was broken so we asked if they had ice in the back but they said they didn't but would ask one of the employees to go to the restaurant next door to get some but no one ever went, I had to walk over myself and get us all ice.  The girl also said that because they knew they had no ice they didn't charge us for the drinks we showed her on our receipt how they had charged us.  So we asked them to just give us an extra order of regular smash fries instead of a refund but they forgot to put in the order and we had to ask them again.  Terrible service,  but the food was good so still gave it 2 stars instead of none."}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone, but I popped my Smashburger cherry at the new Cotswold location.

This is Charlotte's second Smashburger. The first is out in the Stonecrest Shopping Center in Ballantyne. So excited to have one near me. 

My current favorite burger is the truffle mushroom swiss. The barbecue, bacon and cheddar bacon a close second. There is even a regional burger: the Carolina chili. Warning: get extra napkins. You can also create your own burger and have the option to pick whichever bun style you want on existing menu items.

Don't do burgers? Get a chicken sandwich. They smash those, too!! The spinach, cucumber, goat cheese and the avocado club are both delicious. Refuse to eat something that use to have a face? Go with the avocado ranch black bean burger. Interesting texture and flavor. The salads are HUGE. 

I recommend going here with a friend(s) so you can share sides. The smashfries are tossed in olive oil, rosemary and garlic. You can't go wrong with that. Haystick onions are delicious. SECRET MENU SIDE ITEM ALERT: fried pickles. 

This place is slammed at lunch. The parking lot is kind of small and awkward to get in and out of when it's busy. Note: there's only one way in and our of the lot. I learned that the hard way... twice. Both times while driving with one arm. #slinglife. 

The workers are all really helpful and come to check on the tables often. Your first visit you may sit there and try to remember what use to be here. Spoiler alert: it was a bank.

Great addition to this neighborhood. I think this location will do well here."}
{"text":"All time favourite burger joint!!  The black-bean burgers are to die for, the chipotle bun adds the perfect zip. This place is drool worthy!!"}
{"text":"Yummy designer burgers. Can't believe I waited so long to try this place out. The smash fries are fabu :9"}
{"text":"Was in Az, visiting from Cali last week. when I decided to check out yelp for some good eats. Thank you fellow yelpers. Cause this place is SO good, I ordered the avocado club burger and some fried pickles Delish! pickles were on the oily side but still good, my mom ordered the mushroom burger and sweet potato fries and my sister ordered a chicken sandwich with the smash fries, all were very good and next time I'm in town I will definately be back for a burger!"}
{"text":"Great food, it is reasonably priced so pretty much everyone can enjoy a meal here. I personally enjoy the Truffle Mushroom Chicken Burger. It is a savory and sweet combination that meets the palate. Then you can pair that with an Oreo shake and some sweet potato fries and voila, combination to mouth heaven. Plus the staff at this location is always super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ridiculously expensive for a plain cheeseburger. Fries are A+ though and the burgers are always delicious. Can't really complain considering it is Scottsdale.. 

I recommend the smashfries!! So good"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! great food! Yes it can be a bit busy at times but for good reasons. My last visit was fantastic, Dontez an awesome guy took care of everything, food came out quick and he recommended a few food combinations that turned out amazing!! I'll be stopping by again when in the area."}
{"text":"We love smashburger but every time we have modifications on our order they never come out correct. Other locations get them right but this one near our house has the hardest time with them. As an example, we ordered one burger with a gf bun on the side and spinach instead of lettuce so they put the gf bun on the side, there was lots of lettuce what happened to the spinach and we got another burger with the guacamole on the side. The guacamole is on he burger when we got home. I don't understand why one modification was done correctly but he other two were not."}
{"text":"The burgers are great, they have canned beer for $1/can, and the service is always great.  What more could you want?  Be sure to get the SmashFries, too!"}
{"text":"A burger for me is a once or twice a month type deal. The rotation generally includes 5 guys and In and Out, with the occasional guilty pleasure of a \"4 for 4\" deal at Wendys. I think I tried Smash Burger when it was newer in Chicago 4 or so years ago and wrote it off as overpriced and poorly executed. My return trip was motivated by an aggressive coupon, but again I arrived at the same conclusion.

The main gripe was my $8 \"big smash\" had less beef as the little cheeseburger at 5 guys, it was a pretty serious disappointment that their larger option was super thin and didn't extend past the small bun. Also the term smash, really shouldn't apply to what I was served. The patty was spongy and lacked any type of smashed crust that is supposedly this chain's signature. Because the patty was flacid, it was just dripping with excess grease. It wasn't that far away to what a Wednys would serve on good day. My burger was bundled with both bacon and crispy onion strings, but I maybe received a pinch of each. Portion control to the extreme really brought this burger down a notch.

The positives include quality customer service, and I was served surprisingly quick. Maybe 3 minutes after my order was placed. Perhaps they substituted a pre-cooked regular size for my \"big\"? The fries were quite enjoyable, as they are so thin and small they are guaranteed to be hot and crispy.

Smash burger was a terrible value, my basic and underwhelming bacon cheeseburger combo was $12.50. No thanks."}
{"text":"Good burgers but would rather pay less and go next door to In n Out. Very expensive for what you get. Not really worth it."}
{"text":"Don't take out smash burger if you want your order correct. Correction- We ordered to stay , very explicitly spoke to counter about why \"medium rare\" is requested but missed OFTEN , he said MISCOMMUNICATION TO KITCHEN LOL.....STILL CAME OUT \"WELL Done!\" -Sent back, and got True Medium Rare! Hallelujah. Thank the Rare Gods. We asked for no cheese on 1 burger and ALL medium Rare, and their medium rare when you eat in is ABSOLUTELY spot on delicious! Of the 4 times I've taken to go, NOPE WE ASKED YET they were never EVER medium rare!! FAIL!! SMASHCLOWNS, IT IS!"}
{"text":"Their cheeseburgers taste pretty fresh, but I'm mostly a fan of their \"Smashfries,\" that have a dash of herb seasoning and olive oil. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Again, another first from my journey to the west.  A lot of burger competition in the area, but was looking forward to this adventure of taste.  
Amazing!!  Spinach and goat cheese burger was off the chart with cucumbers and balsamic dressing  You hungry?  Go now.. 
Manager, Brian, was very nice and added to the overall experience.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Under $15 for my daughter and me. You can't beat that deal in this town! Most nice burger places are $30 plus and fast food is about the same price. Our first visit here and we will absolutely return. The Sin City Signature burger was nice and the buffalo fries are flavored with Frank's Red Hot. My daughter loved hers so much she finished before me! Great food, wonderful customer service and nice atmosphere. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Good food, great staff, but a little pricey and too LOUD! 

I tried the turkey burger for the first time (mushroom/Swiss.. YUM!!) and it was great - juicy & flavorful!! ... Although a small for the price. The staff is friendly, hard working and accommodating. I took my dad, step mom and grandkids for dinner and was frustrated by the level of noise in the restaurant. It was very difficult to visit.  It'd be nice if they'd do something to improve the acoustics in the place and either increase the portion or decrease the prices."}
{"text":"Food is always good but there computer systems are always down. Would be nice to use our value/rewards card but system issues always. Again the food is good but some \"people\" up front always have attitude!"}
{"text":"I've been two times so far scarfing down the Sin City Burger and the BBQ, Bacon, & Cheese. The Sin City Burger is definitely rich, but amazing. It will fill you up. I also opted for the Sweet Potato Smash Fries and they were a nice change from normal fries you can get anywhere. Fresh and crispy! Their buns are excellent quality and the speed of service is pretty good. An added bonus is that they do serve beer if you feel like a brew with your high temp cooked burger. Both locations near me are right down the street from In N' Out, and that can be tempting, but honestly, SmashBurger has a larger selection and flavor template than INO."}
{"text":"Really good place.   Very good burgers.   Good atmosphere, does not have too-loud music like 5guys.  The staff here are good so far.

Only reason I did not give them 5stars was fries, too small.  I like bigger fries more like Johny Rockets."}
{"text":"Quite a bit overrated for the price, but all-in-all a decent burger.  The total package saves a bland patty.  Excellent shakes.

They once offered a \"fresh-Mex\" burger variety which had enough going on to truly salvage the patty and make for a truly unique taste.  Enjoyed it twice...now it's gone.

There was a tip jar by the register- totally tacky.  Why would I tip for coming to you and paying a premium price but basically getting nothing in the way of convenience to me?  Nice looking place, outdoor seating is great in mild weather.

For my money though, it's In-n-Out.

EDIT:  Something has changed here- They may finally be seasoning their patties?  Taste has really improved!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great burger with a great milk shake on the side then this is your place.  The Original smash with added fresh jalapeños is usually what I get.  I top it off with a chocolate Oreo Shake and then I complete my chubby decision to eat here."}
{"text":"Food amazing! Custom burger ingredients are awesome I don't get burgers anywhere else. Took a star because I always wait. I wish there was a buzzer on the door so they know someone came in. Also they need to detail their fountain drink machine and area so it's perfect all the time. Other than that clean. People are super nice I like the employees they take care of you well once they notice and engage. Costing themselves brownie points not having the buzzer on door to at least acknowledge we have walked in. They don't need to run over I just don't like not knowing if they noticed I'm there or not. Seems like they are understaffed but I think just lacking tools to manage floor. HELLO don't be to frugal..."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. I had a $3 coupon for any entree. I ordered the Big Arizona. 

Its was fresh off the grill. The burger patty was hhhhhhhot. The ingredients were yummy. Maybe the only thing to improve is the bun could be warmer.

Is it 5 stars at regular price $9. No. But definitely the best $3 burger in Phoenix ... In n Out counting as $4. 

Sign up with Smashclub and take advantage of the perks! Well worth it. 

This location could use a little better dining room cleaning maintenance. 

I had a great lunch today! Thank you SB."}
{"text":"Prices are pretty steep for Smashburger but not much else is expected especially since it is located on the strip. 

A combination including a burger, fries, and a drink costed me around $20. 

At that price, it might be worth it to take a couple of more steps down towards an actual restaurant and pay for a meal over there."}
{"text":"Terrible ! Cold food .. poor customer service . Logan the manager was inappropriately incompetent and very rude . Argued with me until he realized he was very wrong with my 70$ order . Never coming back ! Try hiring people who can read"}
{"text":"Smashburger is located on 32nd avenue in the NE...the same strip mall as Basil!  The Smashburger sign is pretty obvious too.  Okay, for starters...I wasn't having a good day at all.  In fact, I was quite angry.  I figured \"SMASH\"burger would be the best place to try because I really wanted to SMASH something....so I decided that smashing a burger in my face would make me feel better.  Anyways, it was a Wednesday lunch hour, 12:30pm to be exact.  Parking was almost non-existent but I was lucky someone was pulling out so I snagged that spot. The line inside was to the door...it was busy.  We decided to brave it and order our meals to go because we had to get back to the office by 1.  We stood in line for about 10 minutes before we placed our orders.  It was good because I could observe the seating area...they had booths, tables, and stools to sit at, it looked like a good amount of seating.

Finally it came time for us to order.  Steven ordered the Calgary smashburger with a side of mushroom poutine and a bottle of coke (~$15).  I decided to go with the same Calgary smashburger but with a side of traditional poutine ($12).  They took our names and we sat and waited.  The wait was another 10 minutes; they shouted our names out and brought the take out bags right to us. 

We each left with two bags...one for the burger and a separate bag for the poutine.  I took a peak at the poutine and was thinking \"This was only $3.99? Sweet!!\"!  When I got to my desk, I opened the poutine and I got a nice whiff of rosemary & garlic.  The nice thing is they put the gravy on the side instead of pouring it on so the fries won't get too soggy.  I pretty much inhaled the poutine...it was delicious!!! (And I was super hungry).  They've got nice shoestring fries!  You can reallllly taste the rosemary and garlic for sure it's definitely an explosion of flavor in your mouth!  I then moved onto the Calgary smashburger which consisted of season grilled onions, pepper jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and Dijon mayo all between a Kaiser roll!  I cut my burger into quarters to make it less messy and it was ...smashingly delicious!!!  The Kaiser roll was soft, the bacon was crispy on the melted cheese, the onions were season tastefully, and the Dijon mayo had a bit of a kick to it! I enjoyed my very first smashburger A LOT.

All their burgers are smashed and grilled to order.  They've got 100% certified Angus beef that is never frozen!  They also offer 100% white meat chicken burgers (grilled or crispy), fresh market salads, hot dogs, veggie burgers (baja black bean burger), a ton of great sides (fries, sweet potato fries, fried pickles, veggie frits, chili, poutine!!...), as well as milkshakes or floats made with our very own MacKay's ice cream!!!!  

I'm getting pretty excited just finishing this review!  Smashburger is a great place to have an amazing burger with amazing sides.  They made my crappy morning into a smashingly great lunch time!!  The next time I visit Smashburger, I will be trying one of the milkshakes or floats to accompany my burger and side!!!"}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to get a burger without cheese? I've been to Smash Burger 3 times (1 time which wasn't at this location) and every time I order my burger with no cheese. And what do I find when I get home? Left over melted cheese all over my burger from a cook who messed up my order and instead of making me a new patty just decides to take the cheese off. Which would be fine except there's cheese all over it still. This has now happened to me every single time that I have tried Smash Burger. The worst part is I've always gotten it Togo and don't get to see the mistake until I'm finally home so it can never be fixed. What if I was lactose intolerant? Please teach your cooks how to read a ticket, it's not that hard."}
{"text":"Rough score, but it was a pretty bad experience. I'm thinking that maybe this store is just so new that it's still getting settled in and working out the kinks...? Anyway, the actual aesthetic of the store is like most Smashburger stores; clean, modern, well lit, lots of red font, etc. but service was poor, and little things get you annoyed pretty fast. 

First off, I came for the \"smash fries\" specifically, which weren't even available. Second, no ice.... Warm Coke with no ice in a plastic cup... mmmmmm. Then one of the employees came over and wiped down our table and wiped all the debris into my girlfriend's lap with a rancid smelling towel, so we tried drying it off but.... no napkins! We waited about 20 min for the burgers.... lots longer than usual, and when they finally came out the order was wrong. So. 

Lastly. You will go insane from the music. Something is wrong with the speakers, there's like a gnarly echo. The front end of the store is playing the song about half a second later than the back. Ok that's all."}
{"text":"Now, I should preface this review by admitting I am not a fast food fan. Having said that; An expensive Wendy's...That's how I see Smashburger. I seriously do not get the four and five star reviews. The BF and I went recently; he had a DIY Smashburger and I had the Avacodo Club Smashchicken (I don't even like typing the word 'Smashchicken'...ugh) which costs $7.29 WITHOUT fires and a drink. To me the chicken sandwich was anything I could get at Wendy's, except there, the fries and drink would have been included in that price! Like I said not horrible, but just not worth the moola. The burger was a little bigger than your normal fast food burger, but didn't taste any different. The SmashFries were ok, I guess. They are rosemary and olive oil or something. The staff was nice enough, but other than ordering, you don't interact with them a lot. It's not like a regular sit down restaurant where they take your order, bring you your food, then check on you (if you're lucky anyway). It wasn't a bad experience, just not what I was expecting. One of the reviews I read says Smashburger \"aims to be a couple steps above Five Guys...\" and to me Smahsburger, Wendy's, Five Guys, Burger King....it's the same. I think I just hate saying Smashthis and Smashthat. Does that Mcremind Mcanyone of Mcanything?"}
{"text":"I'm in love with a burger!  And it's called Smash Burger! 

One of the guys in our party absolutely LOVED this place once he discovered it in Dallas.  In fact, he lives in LA and drives all the way to San Diego to get one; because that's the only place where they have it close by.  So naturally, when we got to Vegas and he found out there was not one, but TWO, here, he wanted to go.  SO I was more or less forced to go.

But I have never been more grateful.  It's funny because the font on the store looks like Gamestop, and our friend works for them; maybe that's how he discovered the place...  Also funny that there's an In N Out just down the street.

It's a $6 burger joint, so you're paying for a step up from your regular fast food joints; and you probably won't eat here every day, or at least couldn't afford to on most occasions, he he he.  The Sin City burger was the bizomb tho, applebacon, cheese, on an egg-bun.  SO good.  Doesn't seem like they use pre-formed patties either.  You can get the 1/3 or the 1/2 point size, I opted for the smaller for this first time.  Also had the fried pickles which tasted like fried zucchini, so that wasn't much of a big thing.  Wasn't too hungry so I didn't get to try the Mint Chocolate Milkshake, but I totally would've if I had room for it.  Definitely gonna hit this place up again!  Gotta try the other burgers!  I could see why my friend likes this place so much.  Good restaurant-style burgers with barely any wait and decent prices!  

Service - It's a walk-up counter, so that doesn't really get factored in here.

Parking - Gonna have to drive or cab it here, cuz I'm sure you're not staying way off the strip, unless you live in the area =p"}
{"text":"WORST SMASHBURGER EXPERIENCE EVER!! 
Waited 30min in line, I understood. Apparently 2 people walked out on them. It's not that that bothered me, it's the fact that my order was completely wrong.  The girl taking my order was not getting it right so I gave her my phone to show her the text of what they wanted. EXACTLY word for word she was able to read it. Now I don't know if that was her fault or the cook. I do know I paid for avocado and got a sliver. The burger from the text was also completely wrong. By the time I got home it was to late. The burger was black-bean and was ordered with no cheese, no onion and no tomato. It came with all three! So dissatisfied. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"At my location the manager alfredo is a complete jerk he was judging me on what I was ordering and also while I was ordering he was just talking to a fellow employee not paying attention to me while ordering. Otherwise the food is always fantastic an I have never had any other problems. 

I have returned to the same location and did not see Alfredo and have had a much experience. Today I was served by Benny who was much nicer and did not do any of the things mentioned above.

I would change my stars to 5 now but the portions have become much smaller so I will keep it at 4"}
{"text":"McDonald's french fries have nothing on french fries from Smashburger...skinny, crispy perfection.
Their burgers are good too. I've eaten here just twice but each time the burger was good. This time I had the truffle mushroom and swiss. A little less garlic would've been great but overall a 4 star burger.

Service was quick..no complaints there."}
{"text":"Way to much salt on everything and I like salt but this was over the top. I was looking forward the the veggie fries but I couldn't eat more than a few. The chicken was fatty, really fatty and flavorless aside from the layer of salt.
My friend raves about the burgers so maybe that's the way to go....


Honest to god I wouldn't eat here again for free. Gross."}
{"text":"I went here for my first time a few weeks ago. Originally I went here to get coupons to wet and wild but then decided to eat here as well. I'm glad I decided such a good choice, the service here was great. They asked if I was a new customer and was more than happy to tell me what to order and how things worked. There are a good selection of burgers and sides. 

I ordered the Bufallo Chicken burger with blue cheese and that was delicious. It wasn't too heavy and had that nice bufallo wing sauce kick! The shoe string fries I got as my side was great too! 

If your looking for a good burger place, I would recommend this place. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I would like to start by stating that the food is great and it's definitely affordable.
My only advice is that they change their on line ordering to allow a cash pay option, especially if they are no longer taking phone orders. Otherwise, exceptionally friendly staff & great food!"}
{"text":"Burger was just okay (fast food places taste the same or better), the smash fries tasted like regular fries- couldn't even taste garlic. And then we were told we could share the individual large fry  as a family but they brought the fries out on a someone's plate so you couldn't share. Then one of the workers tells me that you need to request them to be in a side basket to get the full large quantity, if not they just fill the space in one of the burger baskets so you basically get a regular. If your worker is saying this, then you are an unethical company. And then the girl next to us found a hair in her burger. Definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat so I probably shouldn't have gone here. My husband got the \"Arizona\" burger and really enjoyed it. I went with the vegetarian burger which is basically black beans smashed together. I do like black beans, but I don't like black beans with mustard, pickles and onion on top of a bun. I enjoyed the rosemary & olive oil fries, but not enough for me to come back a second time.

Our total was $15.00 and that was not money well spent."}
{"text":"The food was good. I don't recommend the black burger.
They gave us free fries because of a misunderstanding on our part not theres. 
Hung in tough with a difficult order we had. 
But bring your own drink because all of their drinks are disgusting. 
I'm not sure the water situation but it's bad."}
{"text":"I have been craving a burger all week and finally ended up here. As my first time here I was very impressed with the customer service, greeted as you walk in, line at thd register moved very fast with one girl there, and food came out promptly. Also checked in to see how everything was. All those things go a long way in my book. The burger was just what I wanted, I got the classic but will be back to try the signature burgers next.a little messy but the taste was all there with the right toppings. I prefer thicker frys, vs their straw frys, but lets be honest who comes here just for fries?"}
{"text":"II love their hamburgers and fries!!!  The only two things I can ask for is that their burgers be a little less greasy and for this particular location, their building looks a bit blah, not too much going on, seems a bit cold.  That's why I gave them 4 stars and not 5, but other than that, they are great!  Excellent customer service!!  TASTY burgers and fries!  Oh and gluten free buns!"}
{"text":"Fast casual burger joints have increased in popularity recently. Smash Burger is the latest entrant in this crowded field to make its way to the Cincinnati region. As a burger fan, I like having more options other than fast food and Applebees types of chains for a decently priced burger.

Overall I have been satisfied with the burgers I've devoured at Smash. The burgers come in three different sizes (small, smash, big smash) and I typically go with the big. There is a large variety of toppings and buns to choose from. Their burger is of the steak burger variety. It's not gonna make the best burgers in the city list, but if you are on the run and want a decent burger Smash is a good choice.

Big question is how does it stack up vs. Five Guys? I would rank Smash ahead of Five Guys for a couple of reasons. I much prefer the ambiance and atmosphere at Smash. It is a lot more casual and cleaner than 5 guys. The burgers at Smash and 5 Guys is pretty different (I think both are decent), one thing I like better about Smash is I don't feel like I got hit by a tranquilizer dart after I ate their burger. Not saying Smash is healthy, but it doesn't seem to be as overwhelmingly greasy as 5 guys."}
{"text":"Great food. Mediocre service.

The food keeps you coming back."}
{"text":"Okay, they just deserve 5 stars....why?  Well, the food is always fresh here and so tasty.  Combine that with spectacular customer service and you get 5 earned stars!  Who knew a burger joint could be so well run?  

Soooooooooooo many restaurants need to check this place out and copy them please!  The management here is always in touch with what's going on, helping out wherever needed and that is impressive.  Having been in Management for many years I tend to notice this.  

I've been several times and every employee you interact with is accommodating and pleasant!  The Smash Chicken Sandwich is heavenly!  So nicely seasoned and tender.  The whole grain bun is an added YES.  The Smash Fries are my fav!  Malts rock and I hear the Root Beer Float made with Haagen Dazs is to die for!"}
{"text":"This location is better in the evening!  Lunch can be hit or miss in both service and quality of product.  I've found going later in the evening and you get better stuff all the way around.  They've changed the menu a bit so it seems more expensive. I think you used to get a break if you added a side to an entree......and now everything is ala carte....but the salads with grilled chicken are delightful and the smashfries are yummy.  The Hagen Dazs shakes are super rich and NOT something I get often but are worth it every now and then.

I ask for the Honey Mustard Chicken salad (off menu but they'll still make it) and I like that they offer the salad alone or add protein for a few more bucks.  Seems more fair to the vegan/vegetarian crowd as opposed to omitting protein which you are paying for!"}
{"text":"I'm one of the few but to me this blows 5 guys away.  Great, friendly service and a burger that is amazing.  The fries with red hot seasoning are amazing too."}
{"text":"Smash Burger is one of those places that pleasantly surprised me. I expected a decent burger but I got a great one. The burgers are greasy but they are SO flavorful that the heart attack later on down the road will be worth it. They grill it up just the way you want it with all the toppings you want. What more can be said?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome really took care of me even thought I'm kind of picky go here thank you I can't wait to munch this"}
{"text":"2 parts to this review. 
Food - delicious. Love love love the truffle burger. Everything is top notch. And service is excellent. 

Location - (why the 2 stars) - west Peoria Ave location sucks. air conditioning is too freaking COLD. Has been since this place first opened. And I'm not talking oh a little chilly. It's way beyond that. First visit we froze. If it was a typical summer evening, no problem. On our second visit we mentioned it to the girls taking orders and they stood there, no reply, blank looks on their faces. The girl who brought our burgers said corporate sets the temperature.  On third visit, a girl told us 3 repair companies couldn't find the problem. And she said the bathrooms wer hot. SO, last week I called before driving over and was told the cooling system was better but not fixed. SO, we went to the west thunderbird location. Much more comfortable. 
Note to management, please please fix the problem. Cause we love your burgers!!"}
{"text":"Smash burger has helped my husband and I with our low carb diet as we've been able to eat their burgers with I buns as one of our meal options and they have a lot of burgers to chose from so it's not the same old thing every single time. Their garlic fries and sweet potatoes fries are the best."}
{"text":"The best burger in Phoenix.  Reminds me of how Five Guys Burgers and Fries used to be.  The smashburger and smashchicken (fried) are delicious.  Ever since ordering the haystack straws, I've never been able to muster up the motivation try the fries.  You'll have to wait for your burger or chicken because they make it to order.  That's a good thing, by the way.  And, in case the name of the restaurant did not tip you off, yes, I will confirm it in all sincerity, smashburger is not the place to go if you are on a diet."}
{"text":"First time trying smash burger and I've definitely found my new favorite burger place! I had the the truffle mushroom Swiss burger. The sauce to die for, I love truffle sauce and it was perfect. The mushrooms were super fresh, the burger wasn't too huge and the egg bun was fresh and has sea salt on it, soo yummy! My sister has the BBQ, bacon and cheddar burger, she loved it and I tried the friend onion... Amazing! We also shared smash fries and loved the flavor! Lastly, we shared a butter finger shake and it was also the perfect amount. I'll definitely be back! The service was awesome and the man who helped us order was really friendly."}
{"text":"Will straight to the point. My burger was made fresh  and worth the wait. The size of the burger was not worth how much I paid. I went here because people told me it's great. Yes it good but for the price you get more at five guys or Carl's Jr. I will not be going back but at least I tried it."}
{"text":"The food is good, though the burgers are a *tad* on the greasy side. I get a kid's meal and it fills me up perfectly. Staff is always nice, even when there's a rush, but there's no place to stand and wait for a take out order aside from next to the soda fountain and trash."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger, really I do.  I've been putting off going to this location, and finally got around to getting in there tonight. Unfortunately, I had a bad service experience, and, even though I will probably return, I'm upset after tonight with this specific location.  Here's why:

I got here around 5:30 and went with the all american burger with a haystack of onion rings.  There wasn't a whole lot of people in the place when I got there, but it soon started to fill up after I sat down and started to eat.

Halfway through my meal, I had finished my drink and needed a refill. I also figured since the onion rings were small, I would also grab a fork while I was up at the beverage station.  Mind you, the place was full at this point. 

I stood up, took my purse, grabbed my drink and walked to the beverage station.  As I turned around, I saw one of the bus boys clearing my table. My burger wasnt even half eaten.  I started to go after him to leave my food, and he did not hear me.  He walked right by me with my dinner and continued on into the kitchen.  I was FURIOUS.  I had just paid $10 for a full meal, and this kid was taking it away.  (it was half the burger and half the fries, not the whole burger.)

While he walked into the kitchen, I grabbed one of the burger girls and told her what was going on.  I explained that I had gone to the drink station to get more pop and this kid took away my food and I wasnt done.  She told me to hold on a second, and grabbed the kid (who appeared to be in high school) and told me to tell him what I had told her.  I explained to him that I was NOT DONE EATING and he had taken away the rest of my dinner.  He apologized, as did the server.  I was still upset, and told him I didnt want an apology, I wanted the the rest of my dinner!

They offered to cook me up another burger and fries.  I decided to pass, as I was mostly full from what I had already eaten.  I asked them to get the manager and the kid ran in the back of the kitchen and never came back out.  I wanted them to know what had happened, so that way they would know.

I left and called the store when I got home and talked to the manager. I explained that I was upset, as anyone would be, and had wanted to talk to her about it in person, but the kid who went to get the manager never reappeared. It was upsetting for me all the way around.

The manager apologized and took my name and number.   They said that if I come in, I can have a gift certificate for a free meal there, which is what I had wanted in the first place.

Anyways, even though I love the food here, I dont know that I will be back to this specific location any time soon, due to this whole thing."}
{"text":"Always Awesome burgers! Quick service right by the theater makes this a nice option vs Yard House. I would say a better burger at half the cost us a win when you don't need sit down service. Staff was friendly, nice patio and good eats - will be back!"}
{"text":"After seeing this place reviewed on Yelp, I felt it was time to stop by and check it out.  I'm a burger loving kind of gal, and am always on the hunt for a good peice of meat.  This place definately has it going on.

After finding a place to park in the garage, I wandered into Smashburger and was happy to see that it was a clean new place. Ample menu of items to choose from, with a small variety of burgers, a hot dog or two and some chicken options as well.

I was torn between the BBQ burger and the All American.  I went with the All American, and boy, was it good.  Good came out quick and service was great.  Ya know what else?  They had a bunch of Yelp pens here at the register!!  This brought a smile to my face! Yippie!

What I really liked about this place is the burger is juicy, and not dry or \"corporate\" tasting.  I didn't feel like it was to greasy either.  I found it to actually have flavor on its own as well.  Worth a stop here.

I should also mention that this is review #300 for me.  Ya wanna know what else?  I hit 3000 miles on my car yesterday.  Cool, huh?  Possibly a sign, but quite cool that I am doing review #300 and hit 3000 miles on my car in the same day.  Cool."}
{"text":"I normally really enjoy Smashburger and have been to several different locations, but have to say this location was a letdown. I was doing some shopping at Desert Ridge and decided to come here for a quick lunch. There was just one other group in the whole place, so I was able to order quickly. The guy at the register was very nice and friendly. He was patient while I looked over the menu before making my decision. Once I ordered, he made sure to repeat my order so as to make sure it was correct. 

Food came out fairly quickly. Was a bit disappointed with the size of the burger as other locations I've been to are much larger, even for the size I ordered. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger with a side of Smashfries. The burger itself was pretty good however, my fries were a totally different story. Yes, they were crispy, but that was the only thing going for it. It was really lacking in seasonings. I didn't even taste any garlic on them and the rosemary was barely there. On top of that my fries were sitting in a big pile of oil! They really need to make sure to thoroughly drain the grease off the fries before serving them as no one wants to eat food sitting in all that. 

The seating area could have been better cleaned up as many of the tables were still dirty with crumbs and sticky stuff. I had to go around to several tables before I found one that was the cleanest and then I still had to use a napkin to wipe it down. 

This place could be really good if they just made sure that food was prepared and served correctly and made sure tables and floors were clean."}
{"text":"First time to smash burger. Would like to start by saying the girl who took my order was very friendly and seemed happy to be at work.  I ordered the special burger with fried onions, egg and bacon three of my favorite things. Flavor combination was good I was just a bit disappointed in the meat seemed to be a bit greasy and flavorless. However it was a comfortable setting I'll give it one more try!!"}
{"text":"A lot of people rave about Smashburger so I tried a few different locations starting with this one. I don't understand the hype. It was just okay.

Pros: Food made quickly, none of the locations was very busy.

Cons: The burgers are quite small. I brought this up and they told me some story about how they're smashed so it's the real weight or something I didn't understand, all I know is the patties are super thin and not very big/filling. The menu is very confusing, just imagine the opposite of the In-n-Out menu and that's Smashburger, a bunch of different screens that don't actually explain anything and it all seems the same. The burgers are overpriced, they're charging Five Guy's type prices but offering 1/2 the meat and 1/4 of the taste.

Will not look to eat at a Smash again but wouldn't refuse if someone else really wanted it."}
{"text":"Ate here last week while passing through town.  Friendly staff, average wait. Burgers not as flavorful as in Ca. If you get a soda, you get a plastic cup that you can not take with you. Parking lot is small for full size trucks."}
{"text":"First time I came here had a bad experience. The manger changed my mind to try again and I'm glad. Love the burgers here but man o man do they go out of their way TI make things right. I will stand behind smashnurger anytime Noe. They have made up and more. Thank you guys. 

The food was great. The burger was done just right and the fries was on point. Please come here and you will not be upset."}
{"text":"Had my first smash burger today and it was good! I am a burger fanatic and had heard a lot of chatter about this place so I had to check it out. 
Upon entering the place I was pleased with the decor and cleanliness. The staff at the counter was nice but honestly the folks at the in and out drive through are nicer! :) 
I decided to have the classic smash on a multigrain bun (trying to be a LITTLE healthy here!) and the smash fries. The burger was good and as others have said, it wasn't anything too special. Definitely fresh and well prepared. The fries.........Ummm OK the fries were really good! :) 
I believe they are dressed with olive oil, rosemary and garlic seasoning. Even after sitting in the to go container for about 10 min till I got back to my hotel, they were warm and crispy. 
All in all a good meal but not sure I would pass by in n out often to hit SmashBurger. 1/3 pound classic, fries and a drink came out to about 9 bucks."}
{"text":"i love me some Smashburger! the burgers are awesome and the beef is fresh and the fries are superb for real! when i am not feeling like having frenchfries i go ahead and order their grilled vegetables. good stuff."}
{"text":"So we tried this place and left hungry. Fries maybe a half cup. Never again. We will go across the street to In and out. Don't waste your time. Kinda sad.I read a few decent reviews and a few bad ones. I will trust a bad review from now on. So on the place itself,was clean and the napkin holder was full."}
{"text":"Just another Monday in Scottsdale...received a text and email about this triple double pub burger on a pretzel bun. Oh my! Tasty and juicy with the right amount mmmmhmm mmmm mmmmfff. 

Trenton and the rest of the crew (especially the guy in the kitchen who looks like G-Easy's younger brother). They were kind and heir customer service was above average.

I'll be back for sure, thanks a lot for the up and up experience."}
{"text":"created my own burger for lunch.. here's what i came up with:

1/3 lb burger
chipotle bun
chipotle sauce (mayo?)
lettuce
tomato
onion
fried egg
pepperjack cheese

the patty for my burger was flavorless... but everything else on the burger made it better. my dining companion ate the other half of my burger and realized my patty had probably been left out for a while. he said it wasn't up to the standard he had when he first tried smashburger. darn. i came right before a big rush so maybe my patty was leftover from the last rush? it was around 12:45ish..... 

the sweet potato fries were yum! 

anyway.. the service while ordering was okay.. and food came out in a timely manner. and it was hot. 

one strange thing i noticed was the soda machine was placed in a poorly though out location. not only is it next to the restroom (gross!).. it's on the opposite side of the restaurant from the register. so you have to order.. get your soda then backtrack to the dining area. the dining area and the soda machine are separated by a short wall which makes the space to get soda very tight. if you walk in through the back door... you have to squeeze by the people who are waiting to get the soda. 

i'll give it another try since i was told my burger was not normally what is served. will update next time!"}
{"text":"Seeing that there isn't a Smashburger near where I live, I like to make it a point to visit the house of smash at least once every time I'm out in the Phoenix area. That being said, I think it's pretty clear that I enjoy a good smash.

The burger itself is good, you can tell that the meat is of decent quality and it tastes good to boot. Maybe a little more seasoning to really make the flavor pop, but that's just my opinion. What really makes Smash that much better is the various toppings that go on the burger. There are so many different options that there's bound to be a combination that you're going to enjoy. The toppings are also really good. Now I know that it sounds a little strange to be praising the toppings more than what should be the star of a burger, but in all honesty, that's how it rolls here, they really change the dynamic of what essentially a naked burger.

Oh, and the sides, kinda hit and miss. The Smash fries, I personally feel are a little overrated. I like my fries to have a saltiness factor in them, and with their signature smash fries, it just wasn't there. The flavor was alright, don't get me wrong, but the parmesan and rosemary flavors didn't do it for me. Now the fried pickles and veggie fries? That's where it's at. The pickles may have been a little on the salty side (even for me), but they were packed with flavor, and were really delicious. The flash fried veggies were also a real treat. Who knew that plopping raw veggies in a fryer for a few seconds would make them amazing?

All in all, Smashburger is a darn tasty place to get a burger. Just make sure to load it up with some decent toppings to round out the flavor. Oh, and get fried pickles on the side. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Had the guacamole bacon combo on my first visit to smash burger. I had the fries with the special seasoning on it which would've been better without it. The entree was free thanks to a deal with their app where you got the entree free with the purchase of an order of fries and a drink which saved me $9. The meal was overall decent but don't be fooled by the nice appearance of the restaurant as it it still fast food quality. Decent burgers. The fries are just whatever. Not the best spot but probably the best option for a low cost meal in the area."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but fries is underseasoned when we came to visit recently. Also overpriced for $5 extra for a combo w the burger. That's $12 for just a burger and fries. Otherwise their burgers are still the same and so as their amazing hand spun milkshake"}
{"text":"A novel approach along the lines of 5 guys and in and out ... But these guys have the most interesting items on the menu with avocado burgers and the like"}
{"text":"After. Going to a free preview of mad max at harkins a scam. We dicided to have a nice thick. Juicy. Flavorful hamburger. Cashier was pleasant server good. Dribks are self serve. Washrooms very clean.
  At 6pm place wasnt packed to my suprise.  Nice cool ac was refreshing the seats are very very cushy .
 Our server came back to our table to give us so e napkins and checked on our table several times .

 The food is flavorful and served nice and hot .
Menu is not too big but just right.
  This was our first time to a smashburger and it wont be our last.
 Thanks for a great burger and frys."}
{"text":"The first time I went was with my kids who are very picky.  They loved the chicken strips and the sweet potato fries.  I tried a chicken sandwich because I had just had a burger for lunch, it was great with lots of yummy toppings.  I tried a bite of my husbands burger which is why we went back a second time; I had to get one of my own.   Join their email club and they will send you a BOGO offer right away."}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian don't eat here. I ordered a black bean burger and it came with bacon on it. When I complained they took the bacon off and served it back to me. I don't think they understand what vegetarian means. Eventually they figured it out once I asked for a refund and wanted to talk to a manager. Poor etiquette  and service."}
{"text":"Let me say this, after be willing to try to place one more time, I will NEVER, EVER , EVER Go back to this place ever again. 2nd Time around was not a charm . This place does not tell you the real deal and you are left wondering WTF????? Bottom line: SmashBurger SUCKS THE BIG ONE. Food is not up to par and staff sucks."}
{"text":"I have now visited our local Smash Burger 4 times. I wanted to get a good feel for the menu/service/food quality before I weighed in on the place. After reading some of the previous reviews I could agree that they had their share of the \"newbies\" at this store. In the beginning I think they were working out the bugs and service and food quality was not where it is today. I ordered the Baja 1/2 lbr now twice. I do like this burger because I am a spicy food fan and it is pretty darn good. I believe the 1/2 lb is the way to go as the burgers are much juicier. The last time in I had the Sin City which is now my favorite. Again I would say the 1/2 version to avoid running into a dry burger. The wild card seems to be the Smash Fries. It really depends on the time of day as to how good they come out. I am running about 50/50 good to bad. If you are blessed enough to get a fresh batch then the olive oil/garlic/rosemary fries are great. But if you get them in the middle of a rush or a slow afternoon while they have had a chance to sit...not so good. My wife always grabs the Mushroom/Swiss burger and I always sneak in for a bite. It is also VERY good. I have not run into the greasy issue that has been claimed in previous reviews (mainly because we always dine-in rather than attempt to bring home one of these big ol burgers) Overall they are improving but really would like to see them consistant across the board. Still a really good burger"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever been here, sadly we don't have these in Washington and boy was I impressed! It's the same style as five guys and those places, you order then go find a table and they bring you your food. I had a very hungry toddler, so when asked to bring applesauce quickly she had the whole kids meal to us in a jiffy and even brought an extra for the baby after. The burger was awesome, different than what I'm used to, maybe it's the wheat bun, but I liked it. Shay was so friendly with our girls, we loved her. All the staff was so great and kept checking on us. I'd totally recommend!"}

{"text":"I first had Smashburger in Florham Park, NJ when they opened up there, about a year ago. I vowed never to return. Obviously I can't stick to my vows. I found myself in the dismal Tempe Marketplace trying to decide which restaurant to avoid, and after a process of elimination, I ended up going to Smashburger. Now I remembered why I vowed never to go back. I don't think America is overweight, I think this country is bloated from water retention due to the excessive salt, places like this use. If the meat doesn't have any flavor why does anyone believe that a good salt lick is the way to go? The Smashburger is just salty, there is no real flavor other than salt. I think it would be too salty for the Morton girl. I forgot how hideous the sweet potato fries were. Rosemary? Does not work - at all. The sweet potato is flavorful on its own. If you fry it correctly, the natural sugars will caramelize and produce a nice crunchy, sweet fry. You can accent its flavor with  sea salt, but I fear telling these people to salt anything will result in a sodium overdose. Do they own stock in a salt mine near the Black Sea?

It is very clear to me that making a really good burger is actually more of a challenge, one that Smashburger is clearly not up to. Sarah S. I was disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has restored my faith in fast food! Ordered a specialty burger with my idiosyncrasies (no bun, cheddar rather than American) and the Smash fries with thier special Texas sauce. Wow! And, I do mean, WOW! Bar none, the best burger I have ever had.

Plus, the guy who took our order had a sense of humor, got the orders correct, and even delivered them to us outside on the patio.

Seriously, best burger EVER."}
{"text":"Still my favorite burger joint. Got the buffalo grilled chicken on lettuce. Served up with plenty of sauce and bleu cheese. Nom! This burger would have earned them six stars, if I could have that many to give them.

They were out of sweet potatoes - bummer! - but made up for it with great customer service and super cheap Oly beer (flashback from my Seattle days). Being that they are located next door to a college, I honestly wasn't expecting good service (sorry, kids,) but was VERY pleasantly surprised. We were greeted by a friendly person as we walked through the door. She was busing tables clear across the room, but took the time to welcome us. 

The man at the counter was efficient and patient (with my \"trade-this-for-that-and-make-sure-this-other-thing-doesn'-hit-my-food-and-can-I-get-a-salad-fork?\" quirkiness, I have been known to bring order takers to tears. He held up his end with a smile and some friendly banter.) When he came back out to break it to me that they had run out of sweet potato fries, he didn't deliver it in the typical \"sucks to be you\" fashion, but showed genuine remorse and offered to make it up to me. I got free cheese and onions on my replacement order of smash fries. Good job, kiddo.

Was reading some other reviews, where folks actually complained about the spicy fry sauce. Seriously? That's one of the BEST parts of this joint! Some people are so vanilla-bland brainwashed by the likes of McCrapper's that they wouldn't know good food if it bit them back. I mean, for crying out loud, it says spicy - what where you expecting? Strawberries? Geesh."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Smashburgers but this one was impressive. They had our food (family of 6) out to us before we could fill up our drinks. That's fast! 

Food was great and service was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband been on the look for a good greasy burger and he finally found it. He ordered the sin burger with egg and onion rings and said it was fantastic. Also got a large strawberry malt, and smash fries. Good portions for price. I got the veggie fries, and they were pretty good also. We will come back."}
{"text":"Can't eat bread right now but missed smash burger so decided to try it protein style or between lettuce instead of buns. Wasn't bad but wasn't as good as in and out protein style. My wife ordered the avocado bacon and they forgot to put the ranch on it as it comes and it took forever to get a side of ranch after request. Normally this place is spot on, tonight wasn't perfect. I'll still be back."}
{"text":"First and last time.  I ordered an Avocado and Bacon burger and the bacon they snuck in there was disgusting.  I wouldn't feed it to my dog.  I told the manager and her response was to offer to bring me more.  I told her that was the wrong response.  What she should have done is go clip the ears of the idiot cooks who know better but have no standards or pride.  Sick."}
{"text":"It's really frustrating to look up store hours and drive to the location only to find the store closed 45 minutes early. What's the point of positing hours of the store doesn't follow them?"}
{"text":"Burger joints that purport to be something special abound these days, and burgers are on the menu in many \"fine\" restaurants.  Is Smashburger any different?  I guess not.  Its menu is burgers.  You can pick the toppings.  They have french fries and sweet potato fries, shakes, drinks, and a few salads.

But Smashburger has an edge on most of its competitors - the burgers themselves are juicy and tasty.  This may be because they use (they say) fresh meat, \"smashed\" to order.  Also a bit above average: the bacon, the fries, the courtesy of the order takers.  With no outstanding negatives to offset these, Smashburger moves up into the four star range, as compared to other burger joints.

When will it all end?"}
{"text":"I had never been to Smashburger and had heard many mixed reviews about it so when I got a $25 gift card from one of our patients I was excited to try it! I went with my boyfriend Sunday afternoon and we ordered a couple things on the menu which combined with the Yelp 10% off check in offer came out to be just a little over $25! Perfect! 

We ordered:
The Classic Smash $4.99- my boyfriend said it was just OK.. I think he left a bite unfinished..
Truffle Mushroom Swiss $5.99- I got it low carb wrapped in lettuce... Except it wasn't wrapped in lettuce.. it had a small piece of lettuce on the bottom and it just looked so sad and lonely HAHA I think In'NOut & Carl's Jr. do the protein style way better..
Spinach & Goat Cheese Salad with chicken $7.99- I thought the salad was delicious! Very fresh ingredients and the best salad I've had at a fast food joint.. good portion.. we had to take half of it home. 
Smash Fries $1.99- I liked the flavor combo of olive oil & rosemary on the fries!
Fried Pickles $2.29- These were really good especially with the ranch.. I couldn't eat more than a couple bites though 
Root Beer $1.50- Came with an ice cold mug.. very refreshing! 

Overall,  I think the burgers are not something I would crave or go out of my way to get.. The patties just weren't that great and left something more to be desired.. I would come back for the yummy salad though but at $7.99 a salad bar seems like a better option! 

HOT TIP: they sell beer here!!!! & you get free fries next time if you do their survey on the receipt~!!!"}
{"text":"Late night stop in Vegas after hours and hours on the plane with kids.  Pleasantly greeted by super happy employees.  Food was fast and fresh served with a smile.  Kids turned happy like magic and overall a great place to stop."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Way better than some other burger places in tow, in my opinion. Not too greasy, perfect portions and decently priced. They have enough options to get what you want, but not too many to make your decision like seem like you are contemplating adoption. 

There Smash burger is great, and if you add on their Smash fries you will be in heaven! (smash fries - reg fries with rosemary olive oil and garlic) 

They are pretty quick too, so if you have a limited time for lunch this is a good option. They also have some great options for the little ones and a few other things to try other than burgers; veggie burgers and hot dogs."}
{"text":"After going by this SmashBurger store numerous times, I decided to give this burger joint a try. I must say that I was happily surprised when I walked in. The décor was modern and trendy and the reception I received was welcoming but not forced. 

Of course I went there because I was hungry and I wanted some meat. I was really glad to see the choices available to me when ordering. I chose the  1/2 lb BBQ Bacon and Cheese SmashBurger. IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST BURGERS I HAVE EVER HAD. The burger was cooked the way I like and it was very flavorful. 

I absolutely would recommend SmashBurger to anyone that wants a good, flavorful, gruicy burger."}
{"text":"Why would our whole party get their milkshake in a glass and tin and they forget one in our party and they bring it in a papercup."}
{"text":"Quite a tasty burger for a quick service joint if you ask me.  Everything is made fresh so expect to wait a little bit for your food, but it's worth it.

The burger is mighty good, albeit on the thin side.  Compared to say Five Guys, who also makes there burgers fresh, you might feel a little jipped, however what it lacks in substance is made up for in taste.  

This location seemed a little slower than others in the order taking process.  Only one person taking orders both times I was there, but doesn't deter from the tasty burger, just slows everything down in a town where nothing should be slow.."}
{"text":"Not bad but my favorite remains unbeaten. Service is a little slow and could be a little cleaner but not a bad experience. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"We were invited to join a couple of great friends to go to the local Smashburger, the one on Thomas & Scottsdale Rds., Scottsdale.  It was clean, easy to find, the employees were fine, the order was exactly right.  In this way, it would be a clear 4 stars.  It's only the second time I've had their food (first time was takeout, over a year ago?)  It was good.  The burger was smashed.  I had a \"Truffle Mushroom Swiss Smashburger\".  It had a nice amount of mushrooms; it was moist; I still don't know what flavor truffle is and it looked like one slice of cheese.  I enjoyed it, but would still rather have a choice to have it rare.  
     The atmosphere is clean, but not relaxed and homey.  It's what works for them, but I am more in the mood for a different environment.  That's ok, I'd prefer to go to somewhere that is local / independant, but I'm happy to try out places.  The fries are thin and aok.  Sorry it's a three, but it wasn't a four for me."}
{"text":"Wouldn't normally give a fast food burger place 5 stars.  Here is why I gave Smashburger the honor:

1.  When we arrived all the tables were full.  A couple exited a table right as we finished getting our drinks.  We swooped on it.  Even though we began cleaning the table ourselves, a staff member STILL came, wiped it off with a rag, and gave us a smile.

2.  The food was DELICIOUS!  My chicken sandwich was hot, fresh, and had great toppings.  The bun was even good!  DH loved his 1/3 lb Smashburger and devoured it in less than 5 minutes.

3.  When we were leaving, even though we attempted to bus our own table, yet ANOTHER friendly staffperson came by and grabbed our stuff for us.

An inexpensive meal with a positive and friendly staff... and food that was worth eating again and again.  

Way to go Smashburger!!!!"}
{"text":"Sin city burger was extremely over cooked and had a weird sauce. Smash fries were the only good part of the meal."}
{"text":"Holy smokes, someone must have spilled the entire Costco size salt shaker on our burgers! Don't get me wrong I am a fan of salt...a big fan in fact, but these burgers were inedible. 

We have been wanting to try the new smashburger joint in our hood and were excited when we finally got the chance to put in our order for a couple big burgers with cheese, onions, lettuce, and bacon as well as an order of fries and onion strings. The kid who took our order was friendly but kept forgetting our order, so we had to correct it a few times (no big deal though). It was only about 5 minutes and our order was up and correct! The burgers looked appetizing but when we bit into them the salt was overwhelming. I took the bacon off of mine to try to redeem my burger, but it was no help. The onion strings were solid, but the fries were bland and too thin to even enjoy if they did have taste. 

We were disappointed with our smashburger experience, maybe if there is a next time it will be better..."}
{"text":"This 4 star review is due to their awesome shakes, so let's start with that.

1.  Shakes - It doesn't get any better when you get a nice thick shake, and also the mixing canister it came in that is half full still of the amazing liquid gold!  Tasty, thick, and just right.

2.  Service - If you go right at lunch it will be crowded. We went during spring break and being next to the university and all, it was still busy with business types.  They ask you if you have been there before, and I said no, and they took my order. I have no idea why they ask you if you have been there, because nothing was explained.  However, complimenting the service is that they deliver to your table and they are friendly.

3.  Selection - Salad, Chicken, burgers, you have  great variety of burgers to choose from. IT is a bit overwhelming to figure it all out, however, everyone enjoyed their selection:

Ceasar Salad with chicken - Nice. Tasty, very little dressing which is perfect, and we added chicken on top. Thinly sliced and very succulent.  

Classic Hamburger with Cheese - Just right size for the young ones. They did finish it, anything larger would have been an issue.

Classic Chicken - Nice. The chicken is also cut so thin, it is juicy and just right.

Beef Chili - Not too spicy. good tasting. Plenty of bits in it and it is not soupy.. Nice and thick...

Sweet Potato Smash Fries - These were very nice indeed. Such a subtle flavor.

Chocolate Shake and Butterfinger Shake - simply to die for.


GK says check it out."}
{"text":"WOW. this was really really good. I wasnt too excited to go here but my bf said that he'd driven by several times and hadnt gone b/c he wanted to save it for when we were together. awwwww. 
so tonight we were orig. going to Catfish Alley but they moved ... and are no longer on Flamingo but off Silverado Ranch. well hell thats too far. 

BURGER: 
Baja Burger: see photo: my bf ordered the 1/2 lb beef baja burger. He said the jalapenos although were raw (uncooked or pickled) werent hot at all. He was kinda disappointed in that but he agreed it was a really good burger. He said he gave it 3.5 stars

BBQ bacon/cheese burger: I loved it. Its bbq was on the side. It had bacon *(which if it was on there I couldnt see it) those onion straw type onions. all on top of an egg bun. It was delicious.the show stopper was the patty. it was cooked to perfection, it tasted like one of those homemade patties that was so good. If it wasnt for the patty I would say next. but ti was THAT good. 

SMASH FRIES: OLIVE OIL AND GARLIC. these were good but i love garlic so for me they could stand to put a lil more garlic on these. 

SERVICE: EH.. Let's face it I'm not coming here for the service.. but for the food and a great burger. the guy that took our order didnt really atually take the order but more like just stood there waiting for us to order. Not once did he say what would you like? etc. So we just pretty much had to tell him what we wanted. He at least asked if that was all after we finished ordering. He was just plain weird. 

Would I come back. Yes. do I hope that guy is there w/ the weird name.. no probably not. this is def. a placed to try. 
10000x better than in-n-out! (which is next door in the UNLV hood) if ur looking for it."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place isn't rated that high... solid place to get a burger and their milkshakes are killer too (They use haagen daz so they're super creamy). For non-burger lovers like me, their smashchicken is yummy as well (and yes, it is  a piece of chicken that has been smashed.) It's the same topping options for both. I always get the spinach, cucumber and goat cheese, which also has tomato, onion, and balsamic vinaigrette drizzled on top. I'd say this is the healthiest option but it doesn't taste super healthy at all because the goat cheese gives it a nice creaminess. I just get it mainly for the goat cheese tbh. 
People say their fries aren't good but I recommend trying their fries that are mixed with olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. They're the skinny kind that are slightly crispy but chewy at the same time.
A bit pricey, yes, but I have yet to be disappointed. It's a good takeout option too since they're very speedy at bringing your food out."}
{"text":"I heard about SmashBurger via friends posts on facebook. I decided to give it a try on a busy Saturday night.  For as busy as the place was the line moved quickly. We placed our order which was for one bacon cheeseburger and a truffle mushroom burger. Along with two kids meals for my children which they had to verify existed before even allowing us to order. My daughter was sitting saving our seat. I pointed her out . I guess if you don't have children they don't give you fries and a drink with it. I found this out the hard way when my son's food didn't come with French fries. They quickly corrected the error but it still was strange. The main reason I didn't give 5 stars was my daughters milk shake came out after people who ordered behind us and it was in a TO-GO cup when we were eating there and she would have preferred the fancy cup that she saw coming out with other orders. It was upsetting but the burgers were delicious and cooked to my satisfaction.

Don't go here expecting A+ service but the food makes it worth the $ and the trouble."}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars I would. We ordered two chicken sandwiches online and picked up in store. When we got home the chicken on both were so burnt it was inedible. Worse than the chicken is the customer service. When we drove back to let them know that the chicken was so black it couldn't be eaten the manager's response was \"We have to keep cooking it until it's cooked in the middle so the oil may make it dark.\" As if, without even seeing what it looked like, we were complaining about nothing. No apologies, no humility. 
If your food needs to be cooked to the point that it is inedible just don't serve it! We have had many chicken sandwiches from different Smashburger locations and it has never looked like this. I could not be more disappointed in this location. See the pictures for yourself.
The fries were also cold and hard. Please avoid this location."}
{"text":"Delicious!

Six days a week, I eat really healthy: no grains, sugar, starch, dairy. One day a week, I eat things I normally wouldn't, and today, I chose to indulge in Smashburger. I'm glad I did! 

I ordered a BBQ bacon burger, which came with BBQ sauce and bacon (it's aptly named) and what I think was called onion crisps. I'm not a fan of onions, so I took those off. The burger was fantastic! I would definitely order that again. 

I also ordered smash fries and a salted caramel shake. Both were amazing. 

After eating the burger, 1/4 of the fries and part of the shake, I am stuffed. It's unfortunate, I would love to have finished those fries. 

It was clean, we received our food quickly, and the staff was friendly. I came in with my husband and two small kids (4 and 1) and we ordered 3 burgers, so the kids could share one. The staff kindly provided a table knife without asking so I could cut the burger in half for the kids and they brought us an additional plate. 

It was a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Best burgers ever and their seasoned fries are amazing!
Would definitely recommend this place to just about anyone."}
{"text":"Thought of trying this place only because I'm standing in front of it while we decided to get lunch. 
Another burger place...yeah...another one.
wow, how special."}
{"text":"If I were to walk through the gates of heaven, I think this is what it would feel like. I've never been here before and my life has changed drastically. Ethan guided me and helped me build my perfect burger and I feel like I owe him my first born child. Never stop being you, smash burger. I love you and I'm ready to commit"}
{"text":"Was underwhelmed with the burger and fries there. I did like the option of being able to build your own burger and fries. I was expecting a bigger juicier burger  compared to the one I got. And I'm more of a thicker fry guy compared to the long skinny fry. However the garlic touch was nice, as it was not too overpowering. Besides the food portion of the meal. My milk shake was very good! And would definitely head back for a pit stop food break"}
{"text":"Problems (plural). First, and this is always a problem, I ordered a turkey burger and got beef instead. It was a togo order and not realized until I got home which is a distance away. Previously, it's happened dining in so wasn't the biggest inconvenience. This time it was major. Second issue, the truffle mushroom turkey burger I did get was simply awful. It was literally cardboard  hard- including the cheese & mushrooms!!- and the bread was rubbery and tough. Whoever decided that this was suitable to be served should not be allowed to work in any kitchen. Finally, I ordered the shoestring onion rings, and they were so salty they were inedible. Also, the onion rings were not freshly made tasting like they had been sitting all day. I'll try Park Rd & Ballantyne locations in hope of having better experience."}
{"text":"I can't even rate it a star. I'm typing this as I still wait 1 hour for my burger. Sad. I come visit and drive out of my way for this. Malik the cashier was hustling but couldn't make up for last of production."}
{"text":"Disappointing!! This Smashburger is very close and i have always liked Smashburger. Sadly the one nearest to me isn't great. Undercooked haystack onions sitting in a pool of grease( and i love these, sad this location does such a lousy job), order burgers for more than one person and they come out all mixed up. One person roll with someone else's toppings etc. you shouldn't have to take apart burgers and reassemble them to get what you ordered. If you love Smashburger, try a different location unless you want to collect the handful of free fry coupons they toss at you every time they screw up"}
{"text":"Out of milk at 7:30???  With a yogurt shop 25 yards away?   The burger was decent though.  Typically airport service, typically airport prices. No milkshake for me tonight."}
{"text":"Got a coupon and figured I'd try their triple double burger..OMG there was only 1 car in front of me for drive thru and it took a full 5 minutes each, for the car in front and then for me waiting after I paid at the window. This was my first time through the drive-thru and I'm not sure if this is their standard delivery time. Not super impressed. The burger was pretty good but I don't know if I'll try that line again."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 big burgers only to get home and see they were half cooked.  Nothing against Smashburger as a whole because their burgers are awesome just be sure and check your food prior to leaving or you'll get home and be disappointed like I was."}
{"text":"Hate this location, ordered 2 burgers one with bacon..didn't receive bacon on it, but was charged, the other ordered no onions....you better believe it has onions on it.

They can never seem to get it right here and actual store is never clean. You're just better off going somewhere else and avoiding the headache altogether."}
{"text":"After sending my burger back for the cook not following what the cashier put on the receipt, got home and found a strand of blond hair in my burger....I'm black and far from a blond....but I did take notice to how the cooks just had on caps and no hair nets. Ruined my taste for them so I won't be back"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a decent burger joint in the West Valley for a while and I'm glad my friend suggested hitting up Smashburger!

We went at prime \"lunchtime\" and we did have to wait about 5 minutes in line and about 10 minutes for our food (I know some of you will stop reading at this point just based on this fact alone, but in all fairness, this crazy nurse before us ordered 6-7 burgers and this nerd with a FANNY PACK could NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND!!)

So, I ordered the 1/2 pound BBQ, Bacon & Cheese burger and was quite impressed. It was topped with shoestring onion rings and I also got the Smashfries (prepared w/ rosemary, garlic and olive oil...and YUM YUM!!!) Combined with a soft drink, my whole meal came to about $11. Cheap...not so much. Worth it...I think so. I definitely think they are a lot better than burgers at Rumbi a couple doors down. 

I also love an establishment that has CHERRY COKE on hand. Always a fine choice! They also have a few selections of beer and Barefoot wine."}
{"text":"This place is filthy as soon as you open the slimy  front door, take a look dust and smudge windows carpets floors just a bit dirty to say the least...ice tea lemons, lids dispenser and counters are slimy and sticky. No one care for the hygiene of this location sad to have a handful of employees just sitting around and no one to clean. 

Service is great two thumbs up
Fail in the cleanliness."}
{"text":"Our first time here and the kids loved it! Burgers were delicious! Shakes! OMG! The shakes were delicious. They had scrumptious flavors and cones with an extra cup of ice cream. They also have gluten free and veggie options available. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"First Timer at Smash. I was wondering what is different to their Burgers. Well it depends with what chain you will compare it with.
I would rank it just a bit over In and out Burger, but only cause you have more options here. The Burger are as well never frozen and deliciously prepared. The actual smashing is more a marketing trick to get a new burger chain on the market and visible. But that doesn't really matter. You can taste that the burger are fresh and nicely grilled.

I would have loved to have a chance to see when they are grilled and prepared as with its possible to most IN-out Burger locations. But it is not possible at least not at this location. I have to check others.

But that said i can finish it off with the verdict: it is simply a good burger for a fast food chain.
This location near the UCLA ist clean and the service friendly."}
{"text":"Loved it! I'm a little late trying Smashburger but it was worth the wait. I had the Mushroom Swiss burger and it was delicious! I would say it rivaled my favorite burger from Bachi Burger. The other burger we had was the Avacado club and that wasn't as good but still tasty. The meat was juicy and everything was very fresh. 

The smash fries were good just wish they gave us a little bit more. I am very pleased and want to go back and try their milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want a 12+ inch hair mixed in with your burger.
My husband and I don't eat here often and now we won't eat here ever again.
Got our burgers earlier today and my husband's first bite had the longest hair we had ever seen mixed into the patty.
We called over the food runner and told her we wanted a refund and showed her the hair.  Our refund was processed and we were on our way.  
Thanks smashburger for reminding us why we don't ever frequent this place.  We went to Sweet Poke instead.  Much better option."}
{"text":"So after being contacted by the general manager T.J, who offered me and my husband a free entree, I am satisfied with the service I received at Smashburger.

Our meal came out right away still hot and nicely presented. I ordered the black bean burger this time with spicy Bbq and onions added along with some smash fries while my husband ordered the baja burger with spicy chipotle sauce. 

My bean burger was huge, hanging over the bun by almost an inch. The patty had a lot of flavor and was a nice consistency. it came topped with avocado which I like to eat on the side so I can actually taste it. My husband enjoyed his burger as well even though I thought the meat lacked flavor still. we both ordered a side of small fries which was a decent portion because I couldn't even get through half of them after finishing my burger. I think this time they left the salt of the fries which is good because I like to add my own anyway.

The staff was a lot nicer and less rambunctious than before. They asked how our meal was and took our trays away after we finished eating. The floor was also a lot cleaner and I wasn't slipping all over the place.

After this experience I will be coming back to smash burger to try a salad next time and see if they have upgraded the dressings."}
{"text":"I had high hopes going into this place when I worked over by it. The menu was slightly confusing to order from, the rosemary-garlic fries were good but the burger was kind of meh. Nothing to really write home about, or make me say I would really like to go back!

The staff was nice, the wait wasn't bad, and the environment was clean. If you are just looking for a place to stop by and try so you don't have to go to Arby's across the street certainly give this place a look-see."}
{"text":"Not so smashing.

I mean, it was OKAY, but I wasn't wowed.  There's a lot of places around that do burgers, fries and a drink--this one isn't in the upper tier.  Another reviewer here remarked that In 'N' Out tastes better and has a better price--I find this to be an accurate assessment.

Not much more I can say--it was just. . .OKAY.  With spots like Lobby's, Tom's and Ted's around, Smashburger can't compete.  If I'm going to spend money on burgers, my wife and I don't want okay, we want GREAT.  This spot isn't on the burger rotation for this reason."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time 6-25 about 7:15 in the evening.
Ordered a kids burger, fries & a drink
AZ Big Smash, fries ( no drink)
Avocado Club Smash Burger, fries & drink
BBQ Bacon Cheddar Big Smash Burger
Truffle Mushroom Swiss Smash, fries & drink
Total was over $40- keep in mind one person didn't order a drink or fries, so with that being said, it would have been more!
The meals were just average , burgers were all very greasy. Rosemary fries were tasty; but greasy as well.
We asked for a side of BBQ sauce ( didn't care for it) & a Chipotle which didn't have much flavor.
Service was okay and food came out fairly fast/ burgers were cooked well.
Kinda disappointed-I expected a better tasting burger. I can say we've experienced it but not a memorable one. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I live across the street and I'm 4 months pregnant so I come here pretty often around 3-4 times a week! I have been coming here since December when I moved into the apartments down the street and I haven't had a problem at all since coming here! The workers are always really nice and attentive and the bathrooms and restaurant are always clean. I will continue coming here for the great service and fresh food!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable food.  Definitely liked the smash fries.  They have sweet potato fries will have to try them next time.  In a city where burger joints are plentiful this one is definitely a good contender.  A lot of options for your burger (or chicken) avocado being one (my favorite).  Derek the manager very friendly and eager to help new patrons to his establishment made for a friendly and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Soooooo amazing- I built my own but it was amazing, the onion straws were good and I recommend that sauce on your burger that they serve with the onions.."}
{"text":"I thought this place was good  The burger was tasty and the fries (think McDonald's) were okay too.  I did like how friendly the staff was and the simplicity of the menu.  This chain is better than fast food burger places.

This restaurant is modern and clean, and that is always a plus."}
{"text":"This place is great food is consistent!  Only downside is they started to get super busy. It's not Smash Burgers fault they make delicious food."}
{"text":"My daughter had to go, she loves SmashBurger.  I had the vegetarian burger which was just like any other vegetarian burger (just ok).  Sweet potato fries are great.  Food was served quick.

They are quick to clean, but as I watch them clean off the tables the \"crumbs\" went on the seat but never wipe off them off.  So before you sit, wip off your seat."}
{"text":"Mushroom truffle burger is disgusting - just take it off the menu and chalk it up to an oops. It's awful!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at this place last time but I was willing to give it a try again. Anyways, I tried the bacon cheeseburger with fries and it was so much better this time. The burger was nice and juicy and the fries were nice and crispy. 

Service was very good. Very friendly when ordering and the food came in decent amount of time. Even had people come over to ask how the food was. Not really used to that for a fast food place. 

I would say that I enjoyed my meal today and glad I gave it another try. Another option for burgers is always nice."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing! Friendly, helpful & great service. We had trouble with a visa gift card and they tried everything to get it to work and were super cool about it. The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went for soft opening on pay what you want day.  Staff was friendly, food was flavorful.  The triple double burger was a great value and came out looking and tasting great.  Smashfries were ok, nothing to write home about.   Mine were doused in oil and loaded with herbs and Parmesan.  Will try again after they get through their grand opening days."}
{"text":"Came here tonight only because I was given a coupon for bogo entrees. First off - girl at the counter didn't get my order correct, as I found after getting home. Second, waited 20 minutes for food to cook (just two burgers!) and heard \"Victor\" quietly called by the female employee with shorter shoulder length reddish hair next to the pick up counter. My name is Victoria, so I didn't try grabbing the order because Victor is NOT my name. Now, I understand it could've been cut off or something, but my receipt said my full name and this employee didn't try calling the name a second time or see if she had gotten the name wrong, so I figured \"Okay, that must not be my order\". Lo and behold, 10 minutes later after people who ordered after me were getting their orders, I approached the counter and asked nicely \"Do you have any orders for Victoria yet?\" And this inconsiderate employee barely glances at me and shoves the bag towards me without a single word. 
Won't be returning because of that employee specifically."}
{"text":"The food always comes out fast and is delicious.  The only problem is the food is ridiculously greasy.  I know you're asking for that with a burger joint but I always have a little more grease than normal dripping from my food here. The haystack onions are good on the burger and I like that you can build your own. My husband doesn't like how thin the patty is smashed but I like it.  The employees are always quite friendly and they keep the place tidy."}
{"text":"The black bean burger is a tasty alternative to meat. Place was clean and service was ok. Loved the milkshake. It was a good treat at lunchtime."}
{"text":"The burger was delicious! The milkshake was awesome. The truffle mushroom burger was great with an extra fried egg on top. The only reason I gave them a 4 and not a 5 is because they forgot a few things in my order. I ordered for 5 people so I guess it was confusing, but they forgot bacon in my bacon cheeseburger and an order of smash fries. However, it didn't ruin the experience because the burger was so good."}
{"text":"Got here at 0920. Thats probably why the Crew seemed in a hurry, and the person at the front was hurrying as along, since they were about to close in half an hour. 
Here is our experience:
- The staff made a mistake and swapped someone else's burgers with ours and had to search through pur bag and had to look for it after they have given us our order. 
- The salted caramel shake we ordered was halfway filled. 
- The burgers were dry.
- Onion rings were soggy. 
- Fries were subpar. 
The service and food quality is very lousy within an hour of store closing."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this made it onto eaters list but I wasn't impressed. I've been a couple times and had different experiences each time. 

Price is decent. Style is fast casual but chicken was too greasy.  Burgers are very messy but decent in flavor. However I would  consider come here before going most fast food places.  Honestly, I've had amazing burgers so I have high expectations. 

I liked the French fries and flash fried veggies... Probably not healthy at all because it was too salty but I give them credit because it very unique.  It's not something I would order frequently though."}
{"text":"Most people only write reviews when they have bad things to say, but let me tell you this is quite the opposite....  From the moment we walk in, till we are walking out the door, it is a pleasant experience. We are always greeted with a friendly \"HELLO\" Welcome to Smashburger... Our order is taken in completeness and without stealing a phrase from someone else's place - Special orders don't upset them... I must say that Ashley and Chiara, are ALWAYS cheery and an enjoyable person to give our orders too. I also like the way that you see what you are ordering as you order so in case they misunderstood, (or I mess up my husband's burger, like I usually do) the correction can be fixed prior to the burger getting made.  You get the food the way you want and in a quick time. The burgers are done just right and are not greasy. I HATE when you are eating a burger and you have to have a napkin on your arm to keep the grease off your sleeves, but you don't have to worry about that here. The French fries and haystack onions are a great compliment to the burgers. We each order one or the other and then we get to share and have the best of both worlds. There is never a time that we are there that the friendly manager Adrian doesn't come through and check with each and every customer to make sure that the fullest satisfaction is what the customers are experiencing. Of course, it is written all over our faces because our mouths are stuffed with the delicious food.  We go there every week and sure do miss when something comes up on our usual Friday schedule, so we will make it there another night. One more thing. I am always telling my family back in New Hampshire about how great this is and my sister just came for a visit. Her plane landed at 3:56PM and we were at Smashburger by 5:15PM. Now she is very jealous that you don't have one near her. She said that it was ALL I have been telling her and was very happy to of gotten to go there. Thank you so much for having a place that is a lot of steps above Fast Food, yet still in the affordable range that we can go out and enjoy a great meal.  My advice to anyone that reads this and is thinking of going.....Don't hesitate.... Go and ENJOY."}
{"text":"The week is long and I am tired.  I come into this place just expecting a burger and fries, but I great much more.  I get a superb meal. The burger is top notch and taste so delicious. The fries are dress and hot. The people are so friendly, they make you feel like they were waiting for you.  The place is clean and the temperature is comfortable.  Sometimes in the extreme heat of Arizona you go into places and they over do it with the cold and then you can't enjoy your meal. I needed this tonight.  I needed feeling welcomed and I needed the great food.  Thank you to the awesome manager Adrian and the whole team.  I emphasize the word TEAM, because that is what they are. 
Come-on in,  you will LOVE it.

Bonnie and Armand Croteau"}
{"text":"We've always had a great experience at this burger joint.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The burgers are some of the best around - I think that most of the people who are complaining about greasy burgers are mistaking the juiciness of the burger with grease.  These are juicy, drippy burgers....Yum!  We've never been disappointed.  The kids love this place.  The only downside that I will definitely agree on is that for a restaurant of this caliber, the prices are a bit higher than some places.  That being said, most restaurants are raising prices and will probably continue to do so.  MUCH better than The Habit, but the tradeoff is that SmashBurger is also more expensive.  I recently scored a deal on DealChicken which was $12 for $24 dollars worth of food.  Keep your eyes open for coupons and offers on Groupon and DealChicken!

Contrary to what most people said, we have NEVER waited in line and have always received immediate service.  We have only eaten in, never take out.  That being said, we've aways gone in the evening for dinner and not for lunch."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite to eat. I had the Spicy Jalapeno baja burger with smash fries and my boyfriend had the Calgary burger with smash fries. We also split a Butterfingers milkshake.

We both agreed the smash fries were delicious, crispy not to salty. The burgers were average, pretty good but nothing spectacular. 

It took a solid ten minutes after we got our food for our milkshake to arrive and we weren't impressed. Just an average milkshake.

All in all, it's an okay burger joint but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service. However it's not their fault. There's not enough staff. People polite and doing great job just not enough staff. But the food is good and value is good."}
{"text":"Wish this place was better because its a great location.  It seems like the people who work there just don't care, and I think thats reflected in the food.  When you go to a place like this you expect better than McDonalds, but I find myself consistently disappointed.  They could do better with some effort."}
{"text":"First time trying Smashburger. The cashier was very friendly and the order came out really quick. I got the truffle mushroom swiss with a beef patty on an egg bun. Super yummy, a little on the small size with the regular so wish I went for a bigger size option (next time!). Plus there's plenty of different side options than just French fries. Definitely great place for a quick lunch break and not too far from the strip!"}
{"text":"Found this spot and I'm impressed. The service was fast and friendly. Burger & garlic fries out of sight.."}
{"text":"Holy packed! The fam and I went this past Sunday since it was pouring rain and we were nearby running errands at Target - our first visit and process seemed pretty smooth .... But, the place was jam packed. Lots of families (which we like, since having a toddler can sometimes be a challenge with dining in public). Soda station was clean and stocked, food came out fast and HOT - that's a plus for sure. Staff are young teens who seem slightly uninterested, but that's fine, they're simply dropping and running food anyway. I ordered the avocado chicken ranch sandwich and I've never seen a chicken breast so thin, but I'm not complaining, it was still pretty darn tasty - and the fries, mmmmmmmm......... The fries. We'll be back, just maybe not on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Doesn't hurt that cold stone is across the way for a \"light\" dessert!"}
{"text":"I was hungry after my Dr visit, really wanted In&Out, but they were closed. I decided to take a chance on Smash Burger.
 The menu is awkward for us first timers. I just wanted a cheeseburger with extra onions. The cashier got my order down and offered me a water cup. Several people came in while I was eating, apparently to visit with her, which is nice.
 The eating area was more like a Red Robin mixed with a warehouse. Not fast food, but very relaxed. 
 The first bite of burger was WAY too salty. The limp lettuce leaf and mushy tomato didn't help either. The red onions added a nice bite of flavor.
 The fries were glorious and popping one in with each burger bite saved it's cheesy life! 
 The shake was a chocolate mint Oreo, in a smallish glass but served with the rest in a frozen metal shake glass, great temp control!
 The fries and shake made up for the less than Write Home to Mama burger, and I ended up enjoying it all.
 Torn between ratings I decided that I would be back and try a different burger. If I plan on going back somewhere I assume there's enough attraction to get four stars.

{"text":"Awesome I enjoy all the burgers & have hestd great things.of t chicken burgers too.. So yuummyy go try it a must if in Vegas"}
{"text":"Damn, that's a GREAT F'N BURGER! Expensive, but hands down the best burger you can get. Juicy, delicious and the Smashfries rule! The place is always busy (but not overcrowded). Sure there's an In & Out across the street, but Smashburger kicks it's butt."}
{"text":"Awful.  First they messed up or order and took forever to get it to us corrected.  They issued a refund without asking, cool.  However restraraunt was filthy and no hand soap in the ladies room,  how MUST EMPLOYEES WAS THEIR HANDS if there is no soap?!!!"}
{"text":"Dirty, brought my burger to me wrong multiple times and I stood at the counter for 5 minutes before someone came out to take my shake order. They were joking around in the back. The kids that work there were dirty and disheveled. Overall very poorly ran and managed. We used to come all the time but this will be our last time."}
{"text":"Any time the boyfriend and I can't think of what we want to eat, we can usually agree on Smashburger.  This location is close to our apartment and hasn't failed us yet.  The burgers and fries are awesome, but honestly, we usually tend to lean towards the chicken sandwiches.  The grilled chicken is good, but being a southern girl, I can't resist the fried filet.  And the fried pickles!  If you've never tried these gems, you need to!  They're cheap (only $2.95 if memory serves) and they are amazing, especially with ranch to dip.  
The staff is always friendly and the food always comes out quick and hot.  I've seen a lot of complaints about people waiting a long time for food, but in all the times we've gone, this has never been an issue.  Perhaps people don't understand that when there's a line to the door, you aren't the only person they're cooking for.  
Anyway, if you're in the mood for a good, cheap burger, skip Burger King and hit up Smashburger."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night at 9:00. The sign specifically says closes at 9:30pm. The door was locked while the employees avoided us while cleaning."}
{"text":"Smashburger is in the upper echelon of fast food.  Their restaurant is modern, clean, and the ambiance (if you will) is set apart from typical fast food burger joints. 

The menu offers a mid-range in selection.  Sandwiches can be built to your liking from a considerable amount of options including meat, bun, toppings, and condiments. 

I was teetering between 4 and 5 stars, but Green Tea at the beverage station helped me give the full five star rating to Smashburger (in the fast food category). 

The employees were very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I was invited to a special @SmashBurgerPHX Sneak Peek Preview Party. Of course I attended!

Our hosts, Kurt and Christina, whom I'd met previously, at the SmashBurger location on Cambelback, were again amazing. Very attentive to everyone's needs. Quick to pass you a sample of their DELICIOUS shakes, or a cup for some soda while waiting in line.

Tonight I opted for the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Smashburger, with an added fried egg, and chipotle sauce and mayo. I also added some Cholula, because it's so damn good!

We also had an order of their fantastic haystack onions, and an order of their signature Smashfries, which I described in my other review;
\"The smashfries are pure goodness! Tossed with garlic oil, rosemary, garlic, and other herbs, they were fantastic!\"

Sadly, they were out of their veggie frittes, which was sad, but understandable, given the popularity of the free food event. :D

I have been really wanting to get back to SmashBurger since the previous @PHXTasteCasting event, but life and finances have prevented me. I was OVERjoyed at getting the VIP invite!

Thanks again, Kurt and Christina!!!

P.S. I did not see, and did not inquire about, any beer or wine. I know it is available at the Camelback location. Perhaps they are awaiting a license?

P.P.S.

{"text":"Went to @smashburger for a @PHXtastecasting event.

Our hosts, Kurt and Christina, were amazing. Very informative, and very helpful in guiding us through both the menu, as well as the background of the restaurant and the company.

I have never been to a burger joint that offered a fried egg, to go on your burger, so I of COURSE had to get it.

I went with the 1/2 Lb. Arizona Smashburger; Habanero cheese, guacamole, chipotle mayo, and jalapenos, on a chipotle bun, with added Applewood Smoked Bacon, and the aforementioned fried egg.

The burger patty was so big, it literally eclipsed the bun! The egg was a beautiful addition! I put the top bun on and SMASHED!!!

First bite was AMAZING!!!

Personally, I would not have the guac, as I think it detracts from the heat of the habanero and chipotle too much, but I definitely enjoyed the burger!

I would also not get this particular burger with the egg, as it doesn't, in my mind, mesh well with the other ingredients. Perhaps WITH the egg, but WITHOUT the guac, might improve it.

The smashfries are pure goodness! Tossed with garlic oil, rosemary, garlic, and other herbs, they were fantastic!

The haystack onions were delicious, but I didn't have enough to say more about them.

One of the menu items that sets Smash Burger apart, are their veggie frites; flash fried asparagus, carrot sticks, and green beans.

SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!

Served ranch dressing, but not at all needed.

We were able to sample both the chocolate, and strawberry shakes.

Both were delicious, but the strawberry stood out as being something more than you can get at BK or Jack in the Box. Really good.

They also have salads available, and all of their burger items can be \"smashchicken\" orders, but really, what's the point?

They have a selection of beer and wine available, which is kind of unique for a burger joint. The beer selection is very nice, offering amber and hefeweizen choices, as well as some more mainstream selections.

I am, without a doubt, a fan. I wish I lived closer, but it isn't too far away."}
{"text":"Out of all of the little more upscale burger joints (those without drive thru), it is a decent experience.  The burgers are reasonably priced and are decently tasty.  I would say that if you are going to Smashburger do it for the smashfries (the fries tossed in rosemary and olive oil I believe) and the veggie frites (fried veggies with dipping sauce).  They are the standouts here."}
{"text":"First visit I wasn't impressed but I always give a second chance and glad I did.  The problem was I ordered a combination burger that I didn't like.  The next few times I did a build your own and was pleased.  Now I have figured out that the Arizona burger is my go to burger.  I usually don't like guacamole on a burger since it makes it messy and hard to eat but here they put just the right amount to get the flavor without the mess.  The fries are skinny so crisp up nicely, their flavored fries are tasty but I prefer the regular.  Have had milkshakes a few times and they have been thick and tasty. I did get an Arizona chicken once with the crispy chicken, it was good but I think it would have been better with grilled.   I usually swing by on spur of the moment and the food comes quickly, the occasional on line order has also worked out well.  Staff is always pleasant.  Docked one star due to hard parking at lunch times."}
{"text":"My friends took me to Smashburger while I was visiting them. I ordered the 1/2lb Sincity burger. It was delicious, but a bit overpriced. I had to cut the burger up since it was huge.  I felt a bit sluggish afterwards and had to walk around to feel better."}
{"text":"My dad drives all the way from Tucson to get a burger here. Also there is something to be said for a place that doesn't mind special request orders instead of \" a number five please.\" I love it!!!"}
{"text":"A bit more expensive than the average burger joint, but it was well worth it!

I ordered the regular mushroom and Swiss cheese burger with a side of fries, the service was prompt and courteous, and they took the food to the table. My friend was watching her figure so at first she didn't want cheese on her burger, but then she changed her mind, and she asked for a slice of cheese. They offered to melt the cheese, but she declined. Then she changed her mind again, and they did it for her without complains. I like how nice they were! (And frankly, a bit embarrassed over the whole back and forth thing with the cheese...)

The burger size was a bit on the smaller size, I guess that's why you can order the larger size. It was more like a jr burger at Wendy's, size wise. The fries were really thin so I didn't really care for them. Overall though, I'd be back because that burger was juicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is good, the service is fairly decent, and the food is solid. The only problem is after eating at least 3 times here I usually get the bubble guts and need to be home quick.
Fried pickles are really good and sliced the way they should to be fried. I like the sweet potato fries.
I usually get the Sin City Smash with EGG, BACON, AND Fried Onions. 
Very tasty just eat at home or near home."}
{"text":"It was a huge burger. Definitely yummy, but dripping with oil and heavily seasoned. But you cant help but feel like your arteries are clogging up as you keep eating. The place was incredibly busy. It was too expensive for what it was offering. There was no seating, so we ended up taking our food to go and eating outside on a bench. and parking sucks."}
{"text":"one of my favorite burger but today disappointed few fries and oily. its like they did not bother to cook more ."}
{"text":"My first time at Smashburger! I've heard all the hype, but now I finally got to try it myself. 

My husband, Joel and I stopped in on a Friday night. It wasn't very busy and the staff was already starting their closing chores. For a second we questioned if they were open or not. It was only 8:30 and lucky for us they are open till 10pm. 

It took us a bit to decide since we weren't familiar with the menu. I choose the California Burger with no Ranch and Joel ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger with Smash Fries and a drink. They have a large selection of fountain drinks, but I didn't see any tea. Our food was out to us at a pretty quick rate. My California Burger had avocado, bacon, mayo and tomato on a whole grain bun. It was kinda dry, but I think it was because I asked for no Ranch. Joel's was amazing! It was full of mushrooms, onions, mayo and was dripping with Swiss cheese!! We actually ended up switching burgers. I also really enjoyed the Smash Fries. They were shoestring fries that were covered in olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Great flavor combination. 

I've seriously been dreaming of that Mushroom Swiss Burger since we went. I haven't had a great burger like that in a while. I think the California Burger would have been better if I'd asked for more mayo instead of the ranch. Great quality burgers and fries that aren't too over priced."}
{"text":"The black bean burger is NONVEGAN. The employee stated that the patty is made with egg, and the cheese is pre-placed on top of it."}
{"text":"First timer! It was great! Shortly found out after that this place has a great bang for your buck compared to SHAKE SHACK. Don't go there. You pay double for LESS. Smashburger staff was awesome at this location and they were great with helping me and my boyfriend decide on our first burger from there. I'm a fan! We got burger combos with a drink for only $16. And it was great!"}
{"text":"This place,let me tell you! I've never tasted such a flavorful burger in my life! Its delicious and amazing.this isn't your ordinary jack,mcds,Carl's Jr or burger king but omg freaking so good I think my taste buds exploded thinking about it.I created my own burger and I damn sure made a good one lol go now! Its a must taste and go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Only been here once. Food was good, even though I got something else than what I ordered. 
They were busy, line moved slow. They only had one cashier working. Shakes were over priced, in my opinion, for there size. 

Wasn't the best experience but I would try it out again. Might have been an off day."}
{"text":"The food is very good But having it served by a fellow with long hair and long beard is not...I am pretty sure that is not in compliance with health department"}
{"text":"We're big Smashburger fans. We usually hit the one in Avondale off 99th Ave. Yesterday, though, we needed to visit Metro Center, and I was happy to find a Smashburger close by. Time was a concern for us, so we were happy when we walked in and found no line. We were REALLY happy when our food was out to our table in two minutes--we hadn't even mentioned our need for speed!

The food was excellent. I love my custom grilled chicken sandwich, and my husband had a Smashburger. We shared veggie frites--one of my favorite sides anywhere, and healthy, too--and my husband also had a chocolate shake. The server timed that to come out just as my husband finished his burger, so it made for a good dessert.

It's great to find that Smashburger is consistently good across its Phoenix locations!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is a family favorite. I love that it's a place where I can eat out and feel like I'm eating something both delicious and healthy--oh, that smashed chicken on multigrain with veggie frites! My husband, on the other hand, loves his burger and smashfries, and sometimes he gets a shake, too. The quality of the food is always excellent.

Service has always been top notch, too. Nice folks at the counter, friendly people to grab food trays and clear the tables. 

Another big incentive: they regularly have good coupon offers through their mailing list and also as stickers on the Arizona Republic."}
{"text":"This is a pretty damn good sandwich place. Usually, when I get a burger or chicken sandwich, as well as the smash fries, I am not disappointed. Today, as a result of the new year, I decided to get a spinach, goat cheese, and cucumber salad with chicken. It was honestly just okay. But I ate off of my boyfriends plate. I'd say, don't play it healthy if you're coming here. Go all out!"}
{"text":"Simple, delicious, fast and fresh; everything you would need in a burger joint. Smash fries are a must. They also offer a respectable black bean burger that is surprisingly flavorful. This is a staple burger spot for all looking for a great tasting American Classic."}
{"text":"Smashburger is the business!! If you're tired of the same old burger you will not be disappointed by Smashburger."}
{"text":"I've loved Smashburger since attending a Yelp event at Smash in CA, where we literally got to smash our own burgers and learn about it's background and their mission!

We learned that Smashburger locations have regional burgers and was so excited to try the Arizona burger here. I ordered the Arizona burger, a PB&J shake (as always) and Smash Fries- which come free if you fill out the survey on a Smashburger receipt.

The Arizona burger comes with a 1/3 lb patty, fresh Jalapenos, Chipotle Mayo, Habenero Cheese, Guacamole, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion sandwiched between a Chipotle Bun. Spice lovers, you will enjoy this burger. It was juicy, spicy and had tons of flavor. It is a hefty burger, but I managed to eat the whole thing! 

The PB&J shake is always my fave here since it has Strawberry and Nutter Butter blended into one drink. 

The Smash Fries are okay if you're looking for simple, thin cut fries. They are tossed with rosemary, garlic and olive oil but is very light in flavor.

The service here is by far the best in terms of dining at a Smashburger location, the cashier accepted my survey code and even checked up on us twice while we were enjoying our meal. Now that's service for a burger chain!"}
{"text":"Best burger & fries for the vegetarians! The black bean burger here is the best I have eaten ever. Plus thy have so many free toppings & sauces! Sweet potato & smash fries are the best! ( hint: try combining them :))"}
{"text":"After living in Las Vegas for almost a year and a half we finally decided to try Smashburger. I am very upset we did not try it sooner. The burgers were fantastic. I had a Sin City Burger and it was great. My kids enjoyed their hotdog and grilled cheese and my wife enjoyed her burger. The food was good and the service was even better. The staff kept checking on us throughout the meal and the engaged and were chatting with our kids. For a fast food establishment, this one takes the cake. It was a great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"The guys and I arrived at the perfect time, after the early bird special but before the family scrum ensued.  It is a family establishment but also a grade school hangout.

The high-schoolers  working the counter offered great service and placed our orders efficiently. Smashburger has an order up front and they'll bring it to you system.    
  
I ordered the big BBQ bacon cheeseburger and a side of sweet potato fries.  It was a solid burger and the fries were good, short and thin cut.  

My only negative observation is that when you order a fountain drink, you get a house cup.  Taking a drink to go isn't much of an option."}
{"text":"This restaurant was clean and service was quick friendly. The food came out really fast and was perfectly done. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"To begin with the food was great. We'd never been to this restaurant before so when we had some free time before a movie we went ahead and got some late dinner. I got the Avocado club with grilled chicken and it was great. It tasted fresh and I'll definitely come back to have it again. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because of the customer service. I was surprised that our cashier Jennifer was a shift leader because she clearly had no desire in helping us when we had questions. Being that we'd never been there before we did have a few questions which she reluctantly answered with an attitude. It was very obvious that she would much rather be doing something else then helping the customers. Other than the bad customer service at the register, the food was great and the girl who brought our food was really friendly!"}
{"text":"Avocado burger  sooooo good?  ?  Best burger ever?"}
{"text":"Really tasty burger. On the expensive side but comparable with 5 brothers but more flavorful. They also have fried pickles and military discount. So very happy and will be back."}
{"text":"Average burger in the Rio hotel but given the price is not a bad option. I got the burger with feta cheese (without the bun) and it was pretty good but nothing memorable. 

Price was around $10 i believe."}
{"text":"Burgers are fabulous here when I've visited!  Servers are nice too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch for the 1st time at this location. Was very fast service. Food was excellent as usual. Glad it was so convenient off of Baseline and Rural. I usually go to the one in Queen Creek. I ordered the Avocado Club grilled chicken sandwich, so good. This location is much faster. I will be back to this location for sure. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was pretty hyped about this place because a co-worker would come here often.  I went here with my husband one day for lunch and it was packed.  The place is pretty small for the large amount of people they serve.  I got the mushroom swiss (I think it's swiss) burger and it was pretty plain and regular tasting, not really an over the top place.  And for the price, it definitely wasn't worth it when I felt I could have gotten more burger, and a better tasting burger for less at Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"BF and I took his mom and grandma out for lunch. 

The BF and I grabbed the Sin City burger (egg, onion strings, grilled onions, American cheese, smash sauce, egg bun). This was good, but it was very rich. I think I would ask this without the cheese since egg is enough creamy richness. I was a bit worried about the reviews saying it's burnt and salty or dripping grease. It was cooked medium well, juicy but not overly greasy. It was lacking sauce though so I grabbed some BBQ sauce. 

Mom and Grandma got the Spicy Baja (pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato,onion, chipotle mayo, slice jalapenos, chipotle bun). They enjoyed it and said they would come back again. 

We shared 4 sides:

Sweet Potato Fries- interesting take that it's not plain or sweet, but have savory herbs on it. It had a smidge too much rosemary, but was good.

Fried Pickles- they were pretty good, but kinda salty after eating a couple.

Mixed Veggies- I thought these were going to be breaded, but were more sauteed. They had good flavor and just something different to snack on. 

Haystack Onions- this was the winning side. I love string onions and theirs were nicely done.

Our food came out fairly quickly, but BF and I got the wrong burgers so had to wait for them to refire the right ones. Overall it was a decent burger, but far from being the best in Vegas. It seems there are many comments about it being inconsistent in their food, so a 2nd visit will decide how this place stacks up. For now, I'll stick with the verdict that this was a decent experience, but I still prefer Create across the street."}
{"text":"It's been a long while since we've gone to Smashburger as the first time wasn't the best - salty, oily and a la carte overpriced. Seems things have changed over the years as the food tasted better and the prices seem to be more reasonable with the introduction of combo meals that I started to come back. 

Now the problem here is that the cleanliness of this location has bothered us enough to not return after seeing it a few times...and I see other reviews mention this so it's obviously a pattern and the normal. The first was forgivable as they were actually pretty busy with a sports team of kids and parents. I get it, in a mad rush sometimes you don't get to everything right away and if you aren't great a time management, you'll sink. The 2 times after that it was not busy and the cashiers were just lollygagging about. Tables sat dirty for a long time, if they cleared baskets it took a while to wipe and wasn't thorough, there was stuff all over the floor. I got out a wet wipe because there was crumbs still on my table. If  I can sit there and have a whole meal and tables sit unbussed, there's a problem. I asked for a sauce to dip my fries but towards the end I ran out of some so I decided to finish with ketchup. The bottle was crusty. Sure, a customer did that and sometimes you follow a messy person....so I got the bottle at the table next and it was like that too. I do not think they wipe down their bottles on the daily like you should. 

No thanks. It makes me imagine what they might skimp in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I don't know too much about this chain burger joint.  

This one is located in the food court at Caesar's Palace. 

There comes a time in all my visits to Vegas sans an expense account to charge my meals back to that I just get feed up paying $30++ for a meal without a beverage.  

I've had the burgers here during another visit. It was a burger nothing worth writing a full review on.  My last visit I popped in for a quick breakfast.   

$17 got me 
An egg and cheese sammie-a little dry
French Fries - standard 
Ice tea 

It was cheaper than going to any casino restaurants -- long gone are the days of the 2 buck breakfast buffet.  

The staff was very friendly and I'm sure if I stay in Caesar's again, I'll  get peckish and decide that Smashburger sounds like a good idea!"}
{"text":"Until I drove by and saw this location I had never even heard of SmashBurger before. (pauses for surprise) lol. Figured it was worth a try cause what person who eats beef doesn't always keep an eye out for a good burger?? Inside had a pretty clean cut look and it wasn't dirty or anything. Menu seemed fairly simple and straightforward and it was large and easily readable on the wall left of the cashier. Prices seemed reasonable, not cheap but ok. I saw they have shakes, I'm a fan of good shakes(Jack in the Box's real ice creams shakes are killa!) but I had to pass on that, maybe on the next visit. I asked what the difference between the two sizes is. 1/3 and 1/2lb patty. I decided on the Sin City burger Big Size & order of Smash fries(tossed in olive oil, rosemary & garlic). Sin City comes with bacon, their sauce and an egg. Eggs can be an awesome burger/sandwich topping so that clinched it as the first burger to try! Burger was a nice size and delicious. The fries, I really wasn't sure. Being my first time I tried a few fries first to taste them but I really couldn't tell if there was any rosemary and/or garlic. Far as I could tell it either wasn't really well seasoned/tossed or they gave me regular fries cause they sure seemed like regular fries...Service was good so I was sitting around 3.5 stars for this place since the only real disappointment was the fries. 
Still, would be enough to warrant another try in the future."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying smash burger, and given that we wanted quick, good food on the cheap in Vegas, it was a perfect fix. The classic Smashburger was great, and I will definitely try Smashburger again in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing food and consistently great service. Try the regular size Avocado Burger and the side ranch  salad, awesome meal!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is swooping in and riding the tide that 5 Guys started stirring up.  Personally, I prefer it over 5 Guys, in no small part because at least you have different options for cheese!  The cheddar that they used was deliciously sharp - much higher quality than I was expecting.  The smashfries are seasoned with rosemary, which was interesting, but I don't know if I'd pick them again.  

I liked the modern, sleek interior.  The food came out quickly, so it was still piping hot when it arrived at the table.  

I'd definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"This was my first time there and was a bit skeptical of this location after the reviews. BUT my burger was fully cooked, and my fries and onion rings were freshly cooked. The whole order was out fairly quickly and the service was good! The manager checked on us in the middle of our meal to see if everything was good. The girl who took our order had a big hickey on her neck (tacky) but other than that the food was delicious and service was good :) can't wait to go here again!"}
{"text":"I will start with the good. Good location, good staff,and good facility. I ordered the small smashburger and regular fries ( not smashburger fries).  I just didn't care for the flavor of the burger. It reminded me of commercial meatloaf with a lot of salt and pepper.  In addition, it was extremely greasy. The fries were the small shoestring cut and were very good and not greasy (?). The smashburger fries are tossed in a combination of ingredients....so beware if you are a french fries purist and order the regular fries.

Not dinging this place at all. The burger is just not for me. I will return again and try the salads or a shake. They looked great."}
{"text":"For someone who doesn't eat alot of meat its good. I ate the avocado black  bean burger. A lil messy but I suppose its like Carl Jr...\"if it doesn't make a mess it doesn't go in your face.\" Lol very expensive though! But we are in Cesars Palace right?"}
{"text":"I tried Smashburger for the first time and it was good, a little pricey though.  The shakes are very good.  Just make sure you come with an appetite!!"}
{"text":"The only restaurant I can compare this to is Five Guys because you order at the counter and they bring it to your table. The Twin Cities Hamburger has a very good taste but the burger you get is far from the burger you see on their advertising poster. It is much smaller. The Smash fries have a very good taste with olive oil and rose Mary drizzled on top. The Haystack onions are very disappointing. They are shaved so thin you can barely taste them. The price at Five Guys and here is comparable but you only get one side at Five Guys. But the amount of fries at Five Guys is plentiful. Five Guys by far is the better choice"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with the chicken sandwich. The chicken tasted like it been fried with a beef patty, the roll was wet and soggy, and the sandwich itself was prepared sloppy and gross. I had the burgers before which are ok , but this was a huge disappointment. Just burgers for now on."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting this place. As soon as I walked in the door, I saw several people waiting at different tables for their orders and they all had big smiles on their faces and everyone seemed excited for their order to arrive.  I walked up to the counter and immediately experienced great guest service.  I placed my order (pretty basic, just a cheeseburger with the wheat bun) and ordered the smash onions instead of fries.  As I paid, WITHOUT even asking, the guy gave me a cup for water while I waited. I reallly liked this, because so many other places give u a dirty look of inconvenience if u ask for one.  I only waited a few minutes and my to go order was ready.  I enjoyed the burger very much, it was very juicy, the smash fries were good and I loved the sauce.  I think the prices for the side of smash onions $2.99 with the burger $3.99 without was pretty pricey but the price for the burgers are fine.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about, burgers are boring , the fries are basic the smash fries have way too much rosemary . Two burgers and one order of fries almost $17 , no thanks"}
{"text":"The rosemary fries are pretty great and you can taste the olive oil in them despite being super skinny. The burgers are awesome too and we even ordered off the secret menu (look it up; totally worth it). 

Rating knocked down a bit due to price for what you get and somehow not being as filling as how I would like from a burger place like 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Not my go to burger joint but definitely a great place when you want to switch things up a bit. 

Customer service is good as there's not much interaction besides ordering from the counter and them bringing you your order. 

The establishment can get dirty at times but that's a given when the place is super busy with families (aka kids) 

The food is ok. Not my favorite burger but like I said, a way to change things up. They have a good variety of burgers and fries you don't get at other burger restaurants."}
{"text":"Well, it wasn't as great as I'd hoped.  My Calgary Chicken burger was dripping with greasy sauce and my spouse's beef burger was also a greasy mess.  The taste was good but we were both put off by the grease.  I did enjoy the Smashfries and I like the atmosphere.  It's a treat that they bring you your food and you don't have to clean up after yourself in a fast food joint.  My only other disappointment was the restroom.  It smelled like sewer.  

I'd prefer to eat here rather than the surrounding fast food places but wouldn't drive out of my way for it."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Love the smash fries with olive oil dipping sauce and their classic burger along with their milkshilk to die for, made from scratch.. Downside with this place is you will spend alot of money , a bit pricey but still worth it, you will walk away on a full stomach!  I would reccomend this place if your a burger fanatic.."}
{"text":"Always very nice when I go! My favorite is the Arizona burger! Cashier and employees are very nice and helpful. We've done orders thru phone for pick up and they've always had it on time! 
Always good place to go eat out and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I had been overseas for about six months in a land with no burgers... landed back in Canada, with a craaaaaving. I made the mistake of going to the first place I saw. This was a mediocre Smushburger and small, with a tiny, tiny order of fries. So disappointing. And for at least twice the price. This was the price of a \"gourmet\" burger, for well, something smediocre. At least I'm not craving a burger anymore. :- |"}
{"text":"Always friendly staff there. Love the grilled chicken avocado club sandwich & smash fries! Not to pleased with the shakes :("}
{"text":"Always great customer service ! For sure the best burger in the west valley. The topping are either free or cheap and the mushrooms are always so flavorful ! Try the haystacks you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place was awesome and had awesome service! Loved the burger with the fried onions, smash fries, and oreo shake!! The guy at the counter was nice and gave us coupons for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. We enjoyed eating here. The manager was very friendly.  We came in a busy Saturday and we were able to order and get our tasty food in a good amount of time.  This is a great place very clean and I can't say enough about the service."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night. Waited in line for 25 minutes because they only had one person working the register. When we finally placed our order, we couldn't sit down because every open table hadn't been cleaned off and there was trash everywhere. It took quite some time for our food to come out. The table next to us got the wrong food twice. 

When they food finally arrived, it wasn't bad! I ordered the create your own burger. It was cooked well and juice. They have beef, turkey, and black bean options for the meat. Regular, whole wheat, and gluten free buns. You can add a variety of free toppings and upgrades toppings."}
{"text":"Great customer service and General Manager was running circles to keep everyone happy. Great environment and the food was made to order and delicious!"}
{"text":"The service and people are ghetto.  I rather not eat than go here ever again.  The employees meed some training on hygiene and customer service.  They also need to realize that this is not the hood.  Professionalism is not practiced here.  The food is not that good and the cooking oil seemed old .  i would sooner eat spam than here again."}
{"text":"Cold burger after 15 min wait. Stale smash fries without flavors. Nice place without substance. Think I'll return to Five Guys"}
{"text":"After going several times always being served excellent food, I often recommend smashburger to friends.

My personal favorite is the build your own chicken sandwich. Standouts for me are the spicy chipotle bun and applewood smoked bacon.

My girlfriend loves their salads and I consider her standards very high. She doesn't often rave about salads unless they are 5 star.

Staff is great and restaurant is clean. Smashburger is defiantly a must try."}
{"text":"Who goes to a restaurant with \"Burger\" in the name and orders a chicken sandwich?  Me, that's who.  But I had a couple bites of 2 burgers while I was there as well as trying 2 of their fries.

The chicken sandwich was quite good.  The fries were also good but not as plentiful as I was led to believe from the cashier.

The burgers I tried were also pretty good.  I would go back but the bottom line for me?  Pricey for a pretty good burger.  I can get as good or better for less at other spots around town such as Lobby's: http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobbys-beef-burgers-dogs-tempe"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, and the service has been consistently friendly and efficient. They genuinely seem to care that the customer has quality food and an enjoyable experience. Definitely recommend if you're in the mood for a burger!"}
{"text":"We eat here often and have never had any issues but on this particular Saturday evening, our son wanted Smashburger.  The line was to the door but we love the burgers so we decided to stay.  It looked as though they were short staffed which is understandable and out of their control for the most part.  We sat and waited for our food and as we are watching our food sat under the heat lamps for about 8 minutes.  If they needed help they could have just called out our number and we would have gladly got up and walked over to get it, when the person who seemed to be the manager (I have no idea how because he was the rudest person I have ever witnessed manage a place or he had not people skills) brought our food over my husband said \"Oh thank goodness it's been under the lamp for a while\" the manager then said \"This isn't Burger King\" well no shit asshole we know that! Then to top it off after being their for 45 minutes after eating our food we still hadn't received our Milkshake so we went to the counter to ask for a refund and told them we hadn't received the milkshake and the manager once again had a smart remark and said \"Congratulations\" never once trying to solve the issue, either hand over the milkshake or provide a refund.  He then told the cashier that the system was down and couldn't give a refund.  As he left the cashier to make the milkshake which she had no idea how to make it and knocked it off the counter we walked out.  No refund, no milkshake and extremely rude manager.  I understand having short staff, but kindness goes a long way and maybe communicate with your customers and say \"hey thanks for your patience we are a litter short staffed and we appreciate your patience\"."}
{"text":"The staff seemed to be all high school age or college age students and all very nice, clean, and very professional. I liked the atmosphere for that reason and was comfortable. 
The cleanliness is comparable to a full service restaurant, and you leave your tray on the table and someone comes to get it for you. Definitely better than a regular burger shop. 
I got the Arizona burger which had guac, jalapeños (pretty hot) and chipotle mayo. The bun was soft but if I was doing a burger comparison only, I prefer IN N OUT (the fries were better here though). 
I was disappointed in the chocolate malt shake and won't order it again. It was also a full inch of more NOT filled to the top. I think they miscalculated but should be getting it topped off at that point."}
{"text":"I have said this before and I will say this again, differentiating yourself in the \"burger\" market is tough.  How many different burger blends can you come up with that makes your burger that much tastier and \"different\" from the next burger joint?  Between national and local chains, we are almost inundated with burgers.  So why would someone want to bring a new burger restaurant this way? 
 
Hmmm!  I know why!   Not everyone can afford to spend $20 per person to have a decent burger and fries and not everyone has quite bought into the mystery/questionable burger patties that some places serve that are priced under $2.  Smashburger fills a neat niche...Tasty burgers and sides that won't break the bank and where you don't feel like you have to cash in your 401K!

The burgers tasted like \"beef\".  I know that sounds funny but seriously, I've had burgers from unnamed sources where I really questioned if a bovine was used in the making of the burgers.  Smashburgers tasted like real burgers with real ingredients!  I loved that idea and concept.  I also loved the fact that you could try quite a few burger variations and have several options for sides. (E.g., Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger - heavenly; Steel City Burger - pretzel bun and bacon?  Come on man!  Yessir!)  Most of these burger places don't offer different sides and just offer one type of fry with differences only in the size of the portions.  Honey, fried pickles, onion straws, sweet potato fries, rosemary scented Smashfries.  Child, please!  And while I didn't get to try a salad (I know it's a burger place, but I like options!)  I could be happy ordering one of their salads.  The salads looked fresh and appetizing.

When this place opens to the general public, My daughter Muff and I will be there...Eating real burgers, sides and drinking down real milkshakes made with Haagen-Daz ice cream, don't you know.  And I won't be broke after ordering!"}
{"text":"It's a smashing good time! (Ok, now that I have you laughing, onto the review).

I've been to Smashburger several times now, and each time I really enjoy it.  The service is great, and the staff even joke with you when you have a complicated order.  They are attentive, and quite honestly, with my orders, they have yet to get one wrong.  That is a huge plus for me!

The food is good.  The chicken is a little greasy, but aside from that, it's awesome.  You get a choice of toppings if you want to build your own, or you can order a specialty burger.  Salads are oversize and completely yummy.  The only thing I wouldn't suggest is the 3-way dog, which is actually more of a 4-way (chili, cheese, onions on the dog).  The bun and dog were slightly overcooked and the chili was a bit chilly.  

The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because I feel it's slightly more than I want to pay for a small burger."}
{"text":"Went in on my lunch break, Trenton helped us out..His positive energy/attitude was contagious! Thanks Trenton for great Customer service and a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Went in around 8pm last night and the two girls working there seemed upset that they had customers, even though it was still 2 hours before they close.  They were already shutting down the dining room and we were requested to sit on the other side.  We felt like we weren't wanted.  Fries and Brussels sprouts were greasy."}
{"text":"I mean it's a burger place.  I don't really see what the hype is all about?!

I'll give the good points :

Location- it's great.  I can ride my bike there if I wanted to.  It's off of park road.  Score

Prices-  awesome.  Got two burgers, a soda and fires for less than $25.

But...

...there was nothing spectacular about my turkey burger or sweet potato fires. Husbands burger was greasy and good but again...nothing spectacular??  


It's great for a super casual burger and fries.  Patio and location are good.  But nothing to freak out about."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I had a smashburger with cheese and regular fries. Much better and not greasy like the last time (at a different location) . The regular fries were really good too. It was really crowded when we got there and it took quite a while to get our food but I will still come back because the food was really good!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Smash Burger.  I had the regular cheeseburger and the rosemary garlic fries. All the ingredients were very fresh and the burger was good although a little on the greasy side for me. The fries were very thin but tasted good. There is a bad smell from the sewer or something that I kept smelling off and on(I think it was when people were opening the door. Kind of spoiled my appetite."}
{"text":"Always a great burger and good service.  My girlfriend and I really enjoy the fries with a side of their garlic aioli - I'd put that shit on anything!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Got the avacado bacon club big burger with their olive oil garlic rosemary fries. Those were prolly over kill. Wouldnt get em unless sharing with someone. Great staff, says hello to everyone who comes in the door. Very professional and courteous. Fresh burger taste you cant get most places, all taste like frozen patties. Fresh veggies and great multigrain bun. Little costly at 12, large soda is overkill as well, huge cup. Id go if its in the budget, and you have a partner in crime."}
{"text":"This review is two parts: food and physical store. The food is not great but not bad...it's different. The burger tastes like no other burger I've had, and I can't say it's a good different. I do like the variety and choices you get. Mushrooms, pretzel bun, olive seasoned fries. Great shakes. Although I found it odd they had banana pudding shakes listed on the web site but it wasn't available in the store. I've had Smashburger three times in my life, and it's always been because of other people. I never go on my own, and tend to avoid them because the taste.

The physical store needs work. I look at cleanliness, and find this location to be one of the worse restaurants I've been to. Dust and bugs are very visible. The giant \"SMASH\" sign on the wall has dust on the letters. And not on top of the letters, on the side. Don't look up or you will see this dust on lights, light shades and signage."}
{"text":"THE BURGERS ARE TASTY

Each and every time. The buns are gorgeous (that's what they tell me when I walk in). They take my wife's tomato allergy seriously, grabbing a new knife, cleaning the station, and putting on new gloves. They play peekaboo with my son. Friendly and Delicious. A regular once or twice a month stop for us."}
{"text":"No need for a long review. Either you love Smashburger, or you don't. 

It's a great fast joint that has good burgers and great fries. I don't know too many people that don't like them. 
I personally prefer thicker patties.

The only thing I wanted to write a review for was their cleanliness. We've stopped by here a handful of times since living in the area for however many years. And the tables are always really dirty. I wish they had a trash so you could throw your own stuff out. But they do pick up after the customers. They just never seem to get everything and the tables literally look like they haven't been wiped but after 10 customers have sat there. 
It just makes it kind of hard to want to eat at a filthy table. 

Other than that, it's good."}
{"text":"This place is expensive for the quality of food you are getting!  Its slightly better than fast food places but my fiance and I paid $22 for two burgers, fries and a ONE drink.  The food was also extremely salty.  I've had better burgers for way cheaper.  I wouldn't recommend going here."}
{"text":"I've had their burgers a few time and still not sure what the fuss is all about. I finally decided to have their cobb salad rather than order another burger from them. For the price, it's ok. Their smash fries and onion rings are good. Their fried pickle was a bit too salty for my taste."}
{"text":"Ambiance is good and on the surface you expect to have a better than average burger given the price and the upscale feel of the place.  

I've been there twice, and coincidentally the same things have happened both times:

The cashier didn't know how to input a make your own burger, with chili, egg, and grilled onions (even though everything is on their list of ingredients to make your own)

The cook forgot my chili

They were out of silverware

I asked for a side of mayo which they forgot.

The most recent time, the burger and flavor of the meat was good, but it was a sloppy mess.  The 1/2 lb. patty dwarfed the bun, which was rendered useless.  When I did finally find the lower half of the bun it was a soggy and greasy.

My fries were cold and underdone.

Something seemed off too, as if the kitchen was short-staffed or inexperienced, as I saw orders going back and the food runners seemed confused.

I still *may* go back but I'd rather go to in-n-out like others have pointed out (not Five Guys though, I'd still rather have this than any food from that pit)."}
{"text":"We walked in and went to place our order and the person taking it was more concerned about their co-worker than taking the order.  I could hear the staff mocking a customer who requested their order be fixed.  We ordered all of our food at the same time and yet my daughter's food came out 15 min after ours. (Hot dog) there was no apology no anything.  All of the staff was unprofessional and goofing off and the food was terrible.  It was salty and not worth the money. The table next to us ordered shakes and the glasses came out half full. This was our first and last visit."}
{"text":"This place is great....good food....decently priced....
I usual order the BBQ cheeseburger or bacon cheese with smash fries.....not something I would order everyday but will worth it once a week"}
{"text":"I love this place! The black bean burger is amazing! The staff is very nice, and they provide fast service! This restaurant is a must try!"}
{"text":"I had the Sin City burger, which was good  but a little too greasy.  When we went we were in front of the order line and I went to grab a table.  A woman at the back of the line beat me to it.  It would be nice if there was some order and a system to the seating rather than a free for all grab as it gets busy and crowded with no open tables.  There is outdoor seating, however.  It's nice that you can order a cold beer with your burger."}
{"text":"GREASY! expensive and the actual restaurant was gross...food all over the floor...etc.

If you want a truly greasy burger that tastes like artery plaque then have at it. I'll stick with In & Out."}
{"text":"I've probably eaten Smashburger a dozen times and it's my \"go to\" if I'm craving a tasty middle class burger (middle class burger: somewhere between a Mcdonald's and a premium Gordon Ramsay-ish burger bar).

I so wanted to give a 5 star review (because I love their food overall) but the last time I was here, I was at the register waiting to order for 5 minutes at around 6pm and no one was at the counter, just nobody to take my order...so I waited and waited...and then some girl came out from the back kitchen and another lady (probably the manager) said, \"Hey you have someone at the counter\". Just bizarre to have no one up front for that amount of time and not even be busy.

Anyway, getting back to the food...I usually grab the sin city with the fried egg or the mushroom truffle swiss depending upon if I'm craving those awesome crispy shoestring onions on the Sin City or if I'm feening some truffle mushroom goodness.

It sucks that a bad experience reminded me to finally write a review for a place I've frequented quite often and enjoyed.

Tip: Try the sweet potato fries over the regular ones.

This place has great burgers..."}
{"text":"Arizona burger with habenero cheese and sliced jalapenos.  Most cannot take the heat.  If you are looking for something different and spicy, it is good."}
{"text":"We were in a time crunch and needed something quick so we could get in line for the show. Despite the staff being loud and unprofessional, I liked my cheeseburger and fries. 
Staff was very loud, seemed clueless and used harsh language when customers were in earshot."}
{"text":"Burger was a little dry, maybe over cooked but cannot say for sure.   They are supposed to be freshly :smashed\" balls of angus meat, never frozen.  The fries were great with the olive oil and seasonings, think \"giant string potatoes\".  Maybe I was expecting too much but it wasn't as good as anticipated."}
{"text":"I went to this location with a friend of mine on 6/12/18 around 6:30 pm. He had never been to a Smash Burger before, so he had questions about the menu. We were the only ones in line, which at dinner time speaks volume. The young man at the register acted as if we were bothering him. Getting annoyed with any question that came his way. We felt almost guilty being there. We wanted to know the difference between a combo and a meal, in my mind, they are one of the same. . His explanation confused is even more. It was very unclear and made no sense. After we ordered, we weren't sure what we were getting. My friend ordered a combo, yet got no fries. So weird to me. The young man was chatting it up with a female co worker. I guess this explains why talking him time was bothersome to him. He isn't there to work, he is there to make \"friends\". I own a brick and mortar. In my establish, customers come 1st. Not here. I gave 2 stars because the food was ok, not great, but just ok. My chicken was paper thin, but I guess that is the whole Smash concept. Way too thin if you ask me. It was more of a vegetable sandwich with all I added to it, then chicken. We will never go back."}
{"text":"This time I tried the build-your-own smashburger and it was much better than last time.  Last time I got the AZ smashburger and I think the spices overpowered the burger flavor... but this time it was yummy good."}
{"text":"We went back several weeks after our first visit. The general manager, Geoff, was very kind in his attempts to right the situation from our first visit.
We ordered our burgers to go...I think this review of the food would have been more favorable had it not had to travel 10 minutes to our home. The burgers were ok, though the fries would have tasted much better had they still been hot.
The condition of the dining room, however, was disgraceful. There was one occupied table in the restaurant, and there were numerous uncleared tables. The beverage area was so dirty, I refused to order drinks to go. Several employees were standing near the cash station, appearing to not be doing anything. 
I see no reason to try this location again."}
{"text":"Better than a normal fast food restaurant. Food isn't as greasy and even more delicious. You can get your base as veggie, chicken, or beef burger. No choice is wrong! Will come back"}
{"text":"When I'm craving a burger which is rare I come here. They have tons of different kinds and everything is highly customizable. This location is super clean and the staff is always friendly and quick. I love that the fries are thin and not greasy."}
{"text":"Ok, so let me give you the rundown on Smashburger...
As everyone else pointed out, they were quite audacious to open directly across the street from In N Out, but they really aren't the same thing. 
They cost a little more, and they offer a lot more \"unique\" options: Spicy Baja Burger with jalapeños, Sin City Burger with a fried egg, sweet potato fries, fried pickles (which are BOMB), etc. They have good tasting, fresh ingredients, but they are trying to be more \"gourmet\" or \"trendy\".
For just a delicious, high quality, never frozen burger, I'll still hit INO for an animal style. But, if I'm in the mood for a good fufu burger with unique sides, I might hit Smashburger again. :)"}
{"text":"This is a fave stopping off place for lunch.  I've always enjoyed the food, the staff have always been very friendly and helpful.  Until today.

Colleague and I dropped in for lunch and she placed her order ahead of me.  She was asked if she wanted to donate to X charity and she responded \"No.\"  That should have been the end of it, but the server (#102, wasn't able to get her name) replied, \"Don't care for charities, eh?\"  It just so happens that Colleague commits about 60 hours per week to a charity and was there on a short break from some of those 60 very intense hours this week.

A.  It's no one's business why anyone declines to donate to any particular charity.
B.  If someone says \"No.\" DROP IT, cashiers should never go beyond that.  I'm seriously disappointed to see that another person had a similar experience at this store a couple of days ago.
C.  Managers need to train their employees as to A. and B. above.  I don't care how good the food is, if it hadn't been for D. below, I would never go back.
D.  We spoke to the manager and told her what had happened (wow, how cool is it that a store like this has a young, female manager!?!!?) and she was mortified.  She apologized profusely and appeared to approach said employee to address it immediately."}
{"text":"1st visit to Smashburger after my wife suggested trying it. Very pleased. The food was great, it was clean with a great atmosphere. Will be back many times for sure."}
{"text":"Mmmm. First off Rob, the manager, took my order. He was very friendly. Got the truffle mushroom burger for my bf. He added haystack onions and loved it. I got the bacon cheeseburger. Classic and so good. Smash fries bc yum. I also ordered fried pickles. They were ok. Nothing special and I probably wouldn't order them again. The meal was delicious and really hit the spot for a burger craving. The 2 burgers, fries, pickles and 2 shakes was $30. Obviously you can get a cheaper burger but I think this place is worth it."}
{"text":"After a grueling few days of working out I decided to treat myself to the most delicious looking, exceed my calories for the day sandwich & smash fries. Yeap, decided to get the Triple Bacon cheeseburger which has a whopping 800+ calories (just the sandwich). 

At this point the sandwich was good but I thought that everything was a little bit pricey for what I got. In my mind I'm thinking a burger fries and a drink should be $8-10 and here I am spending close to $16 at a fast food place.

Don't get me wrong, food was good but it took a pretty long time for the order to make it's way to my table. When I say a long time, it was probably 15 mins and the restaurant wasn't packed or busy... 

The location of the restaurant is challenging when it comes to parking and pulling out as the parking lot supports multiple eateries along with others business. Only 2 ways in getting out heading east is a serious risk and challenge. Next time I will order online to get my order ready before coming back."}
{"text":"Airport choices are not the same as they are at a local Smash so don't expect to find a kids meal or a combo meal with ease.  All items are a-la-cart so keep that in mind if you're ordering a burger fries and drink.

I went with to Smashburger one order of fries and two burgers ran me about 18 bucks to feed too young adults. I did make a special request as far as the items on the burger and also to have them cut in half. Probably the most frustrating part was that I ordered two burgers and I watch just one burger was sitting on the top heater along with the fries for over five minutes and I was waiting on the second burger.  The orders went in together and should have come out at the same time. 

I don't like food getting cold fold especially when it's freshly made which I appreciate but it took way too long for the other burger to come up.  When I did it was more of a rush order to eat but still satisfying."}
{"text":"I love smash burger in general but this location is bad. Slow and bad customer service"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying I LOVE smashburger. I go to the one by my house A LOT! I'm addicted. However, I did not have the best experience at this location. All was well until I went to return to my table after getting my drink... The floor was wet and I slipped. Luckily, I was able to catch myself on a nearby booth!

I informed one of the workers that the floor was wet and I had slipped, her response, \"Oh, it is probably this rug, sorry about that.\" So she put a caution wet floor sign up and went about her business. My food came, however, I was missing my milkshake. I informed the worker (same one as before) she seemed a little irritated.... But promptly made and delivered my shake. The food and shake were delicious  as always. 

Unfortunately, putting out the sign was the only action taken to the wet floor and another customer slipped and this time actually fell to the floor. I immediately asked if she was ok, and informed her that I did the same thing! She told another employee about what happened, their solution was... To move the wet floor sign! Yet again. The other lady who slipped and fell got the manager and then someone finally came out to clean up the puddle. If the food wasn't so good their stars may have been lower! 

Puddles on the floor are not to be ignored! It's a safety risk."}
{"text":"I've given this place many chances and overlooked its many flaws because it's close by and their food is decent (just decent), but I can't do it anymore. The restaurant is dirty, poorly managed, hectic and disorganized. I'll never be back to this smashburger location."}
{"text":"This is a solid fast food burger.

I always \"build my own\" and add on everything I like...I really enjoy the bread options especially the chipotle bread...so much flavor and spice.

The bread really helps make the sandwich whole.  The \"smashed\" concept works, but no big deal to me....Customizing it from top to bottom is.

The fries are also very tastey, has some garlic/herbs/oil combination that works well and doesn't feel heavy and salty.

Service is pretty good as well...fast and friendly.

Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"It's time to write a review since we eat here often. I think their burgers are some of the tastiest in town and reasonably priced. Their shakes and root beer floats are the best. Clean dining room and always someone around to bring out the food to your table fast.  Like SmashBurgers better than Five Guys and Fats Burger and they are way better than McDonalds and Burger Kings for sure."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the second time.  Very quality burger, for the people who say in-n-out is better they must be crazy.  I am a fan of in-n-out but my first impression both times is that this is a very high end burger chain style burger i.e. no ordering medium rare, etc.  It beats in-n-out bar none.  Very high quality burger."}

{"text":"Craveworthy Burgers and THE BEST Fries

I've eaten at Smashburger since they started the chain and opened in South Denver. Menu has changed some over the years, but I was super stoked when they moved into Avondale's Foodie Corner at 99th and McDowell.

Service is relatively quick and the people are only par for the course the times I've been into the restaurant. But the food... Oh, my carnivorous happy hoots... 

Burgers are super tasty. Not huge, but the flavor, soft bun, and moistness are superb. The salads (yup, they have salads!) are also great to eat, though you can tell they aren't health food by the salt and oil in the flavor mix. Probably the best two things on the menu though are the Smashfries and the shakes. The fries are frite-style, crispy, and have the most wonderful blend of salt, olive oil, garlic and rosemary flavors. The shakes come in many options-- all have the taste of heavy butterfat, and are perfectly thick. 

Definitely worth a visit, or eight. :o)"}
{"text":"This place is good depending on what you like. We got a few burgers and nothing else. They were good, one was a barbecue and one mushroom. Good quality tastes like real meat not fillers. So on that note  not expensive, not a super deal either though. Everything is a la cart unless I missed something. There were tons of kids everywhere so it must be a family place, and the acoustics were terrible.
 Not for me but could work if your into the burger thing."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers as always and their frites are amazing. Do you know how to make vegetables tastier? Fry them and salt them! Their Arizona burgers are great."}

{"text":"First time and very dissapointed. My order was to go and it was cold by the time we got home (two miles away). Both of the burgers I ordered were completely wrong, but labeled correctly. Also the girl working had her long hair down without an attempt to contain it as she was making food. I was very bummed considering the prices weren't cheap and the quality was poor. My boyfriend and I waited over 10 minutes for out two burgers and large fry. I am never going back and plan on sticking to In-N-Out. They do not meet health code regulations ir customer satisfication."}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers, sweet potato fries, toppings etc.. the location on Las Vegas blvd is located right by the Las Vegas premium outlets south which was conveniently located to continue shopping.. great shakes also from real ice cream"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a few times.  Classic Smashburger and Smashfries are amazing!  They can get a little heavy with the smashsauce so I tell them light smashsauce or else it's oozing out of the sandwich everywhere.  
Nice modern atmosphere and the have workers picking up your baskets and garbage when you are done."}
{"text":"Nice to see Smashburger at the Rio, since we no longer have one near home. I had the big Sin City burger with a fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and onion strings. It was first rate. David had his usual big classic smash, and complained that it seemed smaller than before. Maybe just not enough toppings. Tots were a nice addition to the menu and were good. Wish we had one closer to home."}
{"text":"Had the Arizona Smashburger with SmashFries, Fried Pickles, Chili, and an Oreo Shake. Yeah yeah so much for my diet. I guess today is my Smash-Cheater-Day. The Burger was good, the Habenareos Cheese, Guacamole, and Chipotle Mayo were good. The burger was not greasy at all. The 1/2lb. burger was much bigger than the bun. The pickles were a little salty, but very good and something one does not get to try all the time. The Chili is Steak Chili, very dark, no beans, with Jalapenos & Cheese. The Oreo Shake was Haagen-Dazs with real Oreos...very tasty! The place was clean, restrooms clean, and staff very friendly. Overall a good time."}
{"text":"I called in my order on the phone to pick up at the restaurant. I get there and stand in the designated line for \"pick up your to go order\" for a few minutes and no one noticed me. So i asked if i had to wait in the line that had about 14 people in it, and he said \"well you have to pay for it so yeah\". 
Clearly understaffed for the amount of customers in line. Three people working at 4 on a saturday? 
Not to mention I see my food in the bag sitting there on the counter, not under the heat lamp the  entire time i am waiting. 

I don't understand why they have a sign with an arrow pointing to where you pick up your to go order. Might as well get rid of the sign since i had to stand in the other line. 

I never have written a Yelp review but i am annoyed at this place. 

Thanks for making me wait 15 minutes in line, plus the 10 minutes you said my food would take to prepare. All while my food is getting soggy and cold."}
{"text":"I live down the road from Smashburger and I opened my mail box a few weeks ago and was excited to find lots of coupons for a free burger with a purchase of fries and a drink. My boyfriend mentioned today he was curious about the place and I told him about how good Smashburger was, based on my experiences at their locations in the Twin Cities. I'm glad I decided to take him there on a night where we didn't have anywhere to be quickly, because even though we ordered to go, we ended up waiting 30 minutes for some mediocre food. One star because Smashburger is a decent chain and I will probably eat at another location.  
I started to get annoyed when I noticed several people ordered after us and got their food first. It wasn't busy at all. 
The girl who brought us our food must have known our order took unnecessarily long, because she half smiled at me and handed me my bag, saying, \"sorry about that.\" Sorry about what, exactly? As I walked out the door, I was starving and reached into my bag for some fries, and I was annoyed to find that they had completely forgotten to include them. My boyfriend's fries were cold. I brought them back inside and requested hot fries. The girl at the counter took the cold fries, set them on the kitchen window and sort of giggled and shrugged to the cook as she explained to him what I had asked for, like it was amusing that I would be bothered by cold fries. I did not find it funny at all. I had came into the building at 8:38pm and left at 9:06. 28 minutes to make a black bean burger and a bacon cheeseburger and fries. If I am waiting 30 minutes for food that should take 10 minutes, I would hope that I would be blown away by the quality. Nope. My black bean burger was too salty and just...ok. I had decided to get smash fries specifically for the rosemary and I couldn't taste it at all. They were thin and bland. I'm really glad I didn't pay full price for the meal."}
{"text":"Smash burger has always been my favorite burger chain, great burgers and fires!! I went here during Easter so I was happy to see they were open during this day, upon waking in, we were greeted with such energy from the workers here. It took us a while but we ordered an avocado bacon burger and bacon and onion burger. The bacon and avocado burger was pretty good, fresh avocados and not to greasy bacon on he burger. I also ordered fries and a drink with that burger. I ordered sweet potato fries smash style, GREAT FRIES, ONE OF THE BEST I HAD EVER HAD!!!!! Crispy and a bit oily, but not too oily fries going along with my burger. I would recommend to drink the green tea (Sweetened), perfect drink overall, the bacon and onion burger was good too, the onions do go along with the burger and tasted crispy and sweet overall. 

TLDR: Great burgers and fries along with great service, wish it was a bit cheaper and good for eating every month tho..."}
{"text":"Having Lunch/Diner here, after watching a movie. I got Creat your own burger! And the smashfries are very grease."}
{"text":"So sad.. I used to love Smashburger but they continue to fail. So first my order was completely wrong, I really mean everything. The burger I received was butt well beyond eating. Now this was a Togo order and now I'm stuck at work with no lunch. I called the store they said come back and they would replace it... not so easy when you working. Today I dine on air burgers ( better option then the burnt meal Smashburger provided)"}
{"text":"Really wasn't overly impressed! My burger was just ok. It was sort of crisp/burnt on the edges, which I despise.  Service was lacking any personality.  Prices are decent. May go back, if I'm in the mood for something quick and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I'm a burger FANATIC...So I was very happy when this location opened. Sadly, I probably wont be back. Seems like the sauteed onions, pickles, mayo, etc tasted better than the meat. Just a greasy, season-less piece of meat. Fries were not good, although my daughter enjoyed her sweet potato fries. Only goo dthing was the Hageen-Daaz strawberry shake...YUM-O (in my Rachel Ray voice)...Sorry SmashBurger..."}
{"text":"I was told that this was the best burger in town and that it rivals Fatburger. It wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't the worst.
They had messed up the order with my fiance's order, who is allergic to cheese. The burger itself was good, not great.
However, the smash sauce that they use on the burger is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"We finally stopped at Smashburger this evening. I'd heard a lot of good things about the place and was looking forward to it.

The food was good. The burger reminded me of Steak and Shake back in Indiana, or maybe the old Wendys of the late 1970's. The onion ring things were good, with the same sort of yummy sauce you get with the Bloomin' Onion at Outback Steakhouse. The other people with me had the fries, which were also good--garlic on them, I think. 

The atmosphere was a step up from a typical fast food place, but only a step. The prices were, I thought, really high for what you get. That is the reason for three stars instead of four. I would expect more for the money--better yet, knock 50 cents to $1 off of each item. That would be a winner.

All in all, it was okay. Everything good, nothing great, and almost as expensive as a full service restaurant."}
{"text":"Never again. 

Put extra onions on my burger when I asked for NONE, I can live with that. Luckily (for you), I'm not deathly allergic to them. However FOREIGN BIOLOGICAL OBJECTS IN MY FOOD?!? Unforgivable. I just wanted a salad with the normal ingredients that it has on the menu. I did NOT order the dime-sized chunk of eggshell or the 8 inch length of brown hair that I found at the bottom of the salad bowl. fml....AT THE BOTTOM!!! I muscled passed the crunchy eggshell surprise only to find a stringy remnant of someone's recent barbizon visit tangled in the floppy lettuce romain?!? AHHHH!!!! Do I have to get on webMD now?! What are the symptoms for food rabies?! (Is there such a thing???)

I openly admit that I've got some deeply-seated issues with gluttony; so it's really saying something if you were able to make me lose my appetite before I even finished my meal. Yeah no, I was more happy to eat the 4mo old snickers bar I found in my cabinet, than to finish the leafy $9 garbage disposal petri-dish they I *paid you for*. I gave you money....for you to give me hair, leaves and eggshells with a spicy chipotle dressing. I basically paid to be on your version of Fear Factor meets Punk'd: Restaurant Edition. 

Good God - HEAR ME, ZEUS. If I could leave negative stars (not even stars!! They'd be angry, jaded utterly bitter lumps of poop), I absolutely would. But yelp won't let me for some unholy reason. Maybe if they had your salad, they too would be prompted to make the adjustment due to the inexorable stomach pumping that would almost certainly follow. If fate is kind, the uncontrollable gag reflex will take care of that pre-hospital visit.

I will never...ever....ever (yes. juuuust like the Taylor Swift song) ever.... step foot into that establishment again. Truthfully, I hope at least 556 other people think twice about eating here (there) too. Or maybe the IRS decides to audit you the same day the restaurant inspection people come and shut you down for mixing horrible hygiene with respectively terrible cooking. I hope at the very least they make you create a separate, \"We feed you garbage!!!!\" discount line that is out back that just dishes food out of the trash. At least then, people would know what they're spending their money on.

I do love your salted caramel shakes though. They're delicious. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta go see if this particular location has a twitter page that I can continue my rant on."}
{"text":"Put prices on your menu in window and on the menu by front door! Not good to have to find out from cashier when ordering to find out cost!?!"}
{"text":"This is usually my favorite fast casual burger place. The problem here is the wait. I stopped in for dinner last Friday and the restaurant was understaffed and overwhelmed. My girlfriend's sandwich came out without the cheese and bacon we paid extra for. I sent it back and after ten minutes at least, checked in and asked them to please just put cheese and bacon on it. The staff was friendly. It was a busy hour. Management needs to put their employees in a position to succeed."}
{"text":"I have been waiting 20 mins for my food... fries and a shake.  Still waiting. Every table that does not have someone sitting at it is dirty. I cleaned my own table to sit outside. It's obvious you need to have more staff on hand. It's always a little slow, but this is unacceptable.

When the runner delivered our food she says \"sorry for the wait, hopefully next time will be better\".  Hopefully? Hopefully I come back you mean? 

There is a big oil slick under my French fries... inedible."}
{"text":"decent.  i was going to chipotle, but decided to give it a shot.  i liked the fries.  something just seemed off about the ambiance, but everyone was nice.  worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"I had the sin city burger it definitely hit the spot..very simple menu and they do a great job I will be back for more"}
{"text":"First visit to Smashburger (ever), with a bad first impression. Cost of Classic Smash Beef Patty = $5.59, cost to upgrade and \"Make it a Combo!\" added $4.29, and the cost to select sweet potato fries instead of regular was also $0.20 more. My total bill for a raggedy hamburger slopped together, mustard and ketchup spread all over, and burnt sweet potato fries was $10.91. If I wanted to pay this price, I would continue investing in Five Guys which is worth every penny. Also, very glad I ordered to-go. Highly disappointed with all the hype surrounding this new opening."}
{"text":"Okay, can you say relapse because this fake vegan did just that LOL.. and I had zero regrets! My burger was delicious and the cheese fries were yummy. 
Oh yes :) price friendly too. I do recommend for all the burger lovers."}
{"text":"I eat here once a week for lunch and I am never disappointed. The Sin City Burger with a fried egg on top is delicious and juicy, might want to omit the grilled onions as they are generally very salty. Even though this place is known for their Burgers, the grilled and fried chicken options are very good, especially the buffalo."}
{"text":"So excited they opened up this place near me, and next to the outlets too!

Walking in this place you can see there's a good vibe and layout. Just order at the counter and pick a table. The cashier was pretty knowledgeable about the food choices. And the food came out quickly. Pretty smooth so far.

As far as the taste of the food I got the avocada club it had Fresh avocado, applewood-smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, ranch dressing and mayo. This probably the only burger where I could actually taste the avocado! The bacon wasn't some silly paper thin bacon too, it was bacon only gods would eat. Burger was definitely a 5/5.
The smash fries on the other hand....taste super bland. Just a whole bunch of unnecessary oil that give no flavoring at all. 

Another plus about this place is they you can get any sauce you want for freee!!!!! WHOOOOO

P.S. Come in your birthday to get a free haagen-daz milkshake!"}
{"text":"The food is stellar, and the staff is always friendly. It sometimes takes more time than I'd like to get our food, but it's always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Smashburger has the best veggie burger in town. Though I don't see what the big hoopla is comparing it to the other unique burger places in Calgary. The lunch crowd is nuts for the first couple of months but it has died down quite a bit recently. 

It's a very good burger joint. Not the greatest but very good."}
{"text":"The wife and I hit up Smashburger yesterday.  When we walked in the interior is pretty much what I expected.  It was nice but nothing that stands out.  We ordered our food, the wife had the regular cheeseburger and I ordered the Arizona Burger.  The food came pretty quick and the orders were correct.  The first bite I had I was hooked.  The burger was seared and juicy.  We both agreed that we would be coming back."}
{"text":"Love the burgers! Agree with reviews about dirty tables. Almost every table cooks have been cleaned or wiped down.  Ordered milkshake with my good but didn't get it until half way done with my meal.... and I eat slow. Thank goodness my hubby got a soda. The silverware cups by the fountain machine were empty so again hubby to the rescue with his pocket knife so I could cut mine in 1/2."}
{"text":"El lugar muy limpio, el personal muy atento,  la hamburguesa buena, pero las papas fritas muy buenas."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Smashburger and I have a few great things to say as well as a few things that warrant improvement. First off, it was a Saturday afternoon and it was not too busy (maybe 10 patrons in all). The employees seemed a bit stressed and understaffed although they were trying their very best to do it all. Clean off tables, take orders, bring out orders to customers. It took a long time to get our food, I overheard that they were not prepped properly before the shift so many things weren't quite ready to go. Sadly, the customers were upset waiting and it was hard on the employees because it's not technically their fault. I say this because having worked in the restaurant industry myself for many years I completely understand that if a previous shift did not properly set up for the next shift to come in, it does indeed affect everyone down the line. I also know what it's like when you're doing the best you can but customers still aren't happy. In my case I wasn't in a hurry per se and the cashier was so pleasant and hard working how could you possibly be upset? She apologized for our food taking so long and brought us anything we needed. I give her an A+ for work ethic and attitude, something you don't always see these days. I ordered the black bean burger which was great with the exception that the bun is so tiny my burger fell apart completely. Please get a larger bun or make the patties smaller smashburger :) hint...hint....
Fries with truffle oil were amazing as was the chocolate shake. Yes, I'd totally be back when in the mood for a burger and fries but please staff better and make sure the teams are doing their jobs properly or you'll end up with more unhappy customers over time. This was my first time here and had I not had past experience in hospitality I may have had a different perspective altogether on the day's experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service over priced steak and shake there chili was a cup of grease literally"}
{"text":"I was quite surprised.  I came here expecting decent burgers, and I was pleasantly surprised with better food than I expected.

The warning I give here is that the burgers are pretty greasy, but the taste is great.  I got the Arizona Smashburger 1/2 lb (no guac and no tomato) and haystack onions.  The burger was quite large (though more wide than thick) and juicy, the toppings were fresh, and the bun was great, adding a nice complement to the rest.

This may not have been the best burger I have ever had, but it was good enough that I will come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Traveling through Phoenix looking for someplace to stop and eat, we stumbled upon Smashburger.

You order at the counter, seat yourself and the food is delivered to your table. They sell beer and fountain soda to help you wash down your burger and accoutrements.

My wife and I both got the Classic, a burger with \"Smash sauce\" (described by the counter clerk as a mixture of mayo, mustard and pickle relish), lettuce, onion, pickle, and tomato. The burgers were:

1. Obviously fresh, not frozen, meat - this was apparent by the odd shape of the meat.
2. Juicy and not overcooked.
3. Seasoned well

We were both happy with our burgers.

The garlic and rosemary fries were good, when hot. When they cooled down, the flavor became almost cloying. Maybe it's just because I am not too big a fan of rosemary. Nonetheless, an interesting take on fast food fries.

I was not too unhappy with the price tag. Two burgers and fries for $14. Seems pretty standard to me. The atmosphere of the place is kind of sterile. It's not a place to grab a burger, have a few beers and hang out. As I said, we were traveling through, so it met our needs well for this visit and I would likely return."}
{"text":"Our favorite hamburger place. Service was friendly and fast. Nice kick to the buffalo and blue cheese burger. Fries were hot and crisp. Not sure about other poor reviews. Maybe staff has been trained now. Not too salty and fries size was OK today."}
{"text":"It is Smashburger, where they smash the lights out of your burger, throw a jalapeno on it and call it Arizona __something or another. 

It's cool for a quick bite. That's about it."}
{"text":"it has been awhile I have ventured here,, with bogo coupon in hand , there i went.. I tried the truffle/mushroom burger, got the condiment sides I wanted, but unfortunately they only can cook the burger well done?? What is with the burger cooked til it is burnt, not juicy at all( I asked for medium), but was told cannot be done that way????
Well I guess the customer is not right and cannot get their burger their way here, so I will not be back... Service was quick and friendly, but no more burnt burgers for me.
My dog like the hamburger , but then again she is a dog, who loves here meat.
I will not be back....................."}
{"text":"fast food burger joint, nothing new here(inside fiesta rancho casino)... got the avocado club chicken sandwich,loaded with mayo and ranch sauce, too much for my liking, making the sandwich salty. Afterwards made me real thirsty, it sound good, but I thought it could of been better, maybe should of tried the burger, but it will be awhile, no desire to return... Yes food menu was pricey for burgers and drinks... Service was fast, not much seating when crowded, took mine to go.."}
{"text":"Excellent burger with fresh ingredients. Saskatoon milkshake with real milk and berries not fake flavour.    Enough berries to plug straw.  Good thing they do the old fashioned can and glass for the milkshake and you get a spoon to unplug."}
{"text":"Not a bad $3.00 burger, unfortunately it's $8.00!  Yam fries overcooked and thin. Good shake, but staff needs to organize drink and dinner at same time."}
{"text":"I came here on a really busy night. Standing room only because of my daughters school promotion. The service was excellent.  The food was quick and mostly great. My daughters burger tasted like SALT with a little meat taste. They obviously messed up while cooking. I didn't realize how salty it was until we got home and she prompted me to taste how bad it was. I am sure they would have corrected it, but it was too late by the time that we realized it. The only other thing that I dislike about this chain... Is the open container of lemons at the beverage bar. Usually there is wrappers and stuff in there. It's just gross... They need to do something about that."}
{"text":"Umm..some guy invited me here and truly truly..the only thing good here was the Smash fries...thats it....it should be called Smash Expectations Cafe...not worth stepping inside this place!  Sorry..its the truth!"}
{"text":"Had an online order for two black bean burgers. When I got back, both were beef. Not even close to the same. And the sandwiches were sloppily put together. Been  to another smashburger and the service and food was good. Just avoid this one because I always seem to have negative experiences."}
{"text":"I was so happy when I found out Smashburger was coming to my neighborhood. Since they have opened the Cotswold location, I have been twice and had a burger both times. The Carolina Chili burger and the Spicy Jalapeno Baja burger were great! The fries are too thin in my opinion, but if you get the Smashfries you are in for a tasty treat. The burger patty itself was so juicy and delicious. I removed the huge jalapenos from my burger just because they were so big, and the sandwich was still spicy to my liking without them. 

The prices are reasonable, but it would be better if a small side of fries came with the burgers instead of having to purchase them separately. What's a burger without fries? The staff was nice, but had an issue when my husband and I wanted to order our sandwiches before the fries. For some reason, that complicated things? 

My only complaint is the booths are not high enough for the tables. They are terribly uncomfortable. I recommend the restaurant get that situation fixed. I am average height, 5'7\", so I can't image a shorter person or child trying to sit there to eat. 

I recommend Smashburger when you want a quick bite to eat. A little better than fastfood, but you also pay for it."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. They never get my order right. I stop going due to the over pricing and always get my order wrong. My husband decided to stop today and get there \"Big Smash with the added Big patty\" and he asked the cashier to add bacon. When we got home there were no bbacon added and no added Big patty. Now my husband is mad and very unsatisfied said he will never eat at this place. Bad customer service and business. That's why I refuse to spend my money at this place. It's not worth the fit."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers. They tend to be a little salty sometimes due to the cooks getting a little overzealous with the seasoning when they are cooking up the patties. We have started to request no seasonings on the hamburger meat and that has solved that problem. I'm giving 3 stars because I'm not a huge fan of the shoestring style french fries and although they have a few flavor options for the fries they don't offer anything other than shoestring style fries. My wife got a salad once and it was pretty big and she said it was good. Overall, other than the fries we really like this place."}
{"text":"I don't partake in the burger often, but when I do... I order the chicken. That's right. I am a fan of Smashburger's chicken sandwich for a couple of reasons: 

1. You can get it on a whole wheat bun.
2. You can top it with just about anything you want.
3. It is smashed super thin, and I like a nice, thin chicken breast sammie. 

Despite being thin, the sandwich is still quite filling, so most of the time, I don't need any sides to have a fulfilling lunch. However, they do offer some creative sides, including sweet potato fries with rosemary and fried veggie sticks. It's actually fun to choose your side because the options are not ordinary. 

It's a burger spot that has something for everyone, even those who don't want a burger, and even those that want a salad. I find the service as this location to be especially friendly and attentive. My only mild complaint is that depending on who is on the grill, the offerings may come out a tad greasier than I'd hope, but not so greasy that I won't return!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is pretty good overall. Better than Five Guys, although I wish it were a little closer to where I live!

I've been twice - once to this location and once to another, both times with my husband. The first time, we got fries, he got the bacon cheeseburger (which he raved about and I tried a bite to confirm that it is in fact delicious). I got the black bean burger, and it was a little spicy for my wimpy tastes. It does say spicy in the name I guess... The second time, I got chicken with cucumber and goat cheese. I liked it, but my husband loved it. He got a bacon ranch avocado burger, which was yummy but super greasy and the avocado wasn't ripe enough. But the amazing Oreo milkshake more than made up for it. It cost around $18-19 for two sandwiches and the milkshake (no fries or other drinks). 

Every employee I've interacted with at Smashburger has been friendly, polite, professional, just good people overall. I don't eat meat often, but if I'm craving a burger, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch.  The service was good and the burger was really good.  I really don't have any complaints.  I would return."}
{"text":"Good fresh burger.  Ordered a build your own with applewood smoked bacon, blue cheese, haystack onions.  The burger was good and enjoyed the toppings.  Liked the haystack onions.  Had a delicious creamy Strawberry shake and some Smashfries that have olive oil, rosemary & garlic.  The fries are shoestring and OK, would have preferred fatter fries.   It is a little more expensive than regular burger fast food places but you get a big burger and good quality."}
{"text":"Wow! The customer service here is fantastic. The staff is so hospitable and friendly. I've been very impressed with how I've been treated the two times I've eaten here. The burgers and fries are super yummy here too!"}
{"text":"BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger....yummmmm!  Hands down one of the best burgers in town :)  Would I recommend to others?  Um, YEAH."}
{"text":"This place is to burgers what chipotle is to burritos, a little bit better than their true fast food counterparts. The staff I encountered was very nice and they bring the food out to you, clean up after you, and are very very friendly. 

I tried their new Buffalo Smashchicken with Sweet Potato Smashfries. Both were excellent and I would return here before I ran off to Arbys, Five Guys, etc. Pricing was very fair at $8.75 for a sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"Military appreciation here is awesome! Food is served fresh and the short time is minimum. Clean location. Friendly staff. Affordable prices."}
{"text":"The hamburgers are good, although the smashed patties aren't much meat.  I don't care for the extra thin fries as they don't hold much ketchup.  And it's very expensive as a single patty burger, thin fries and a small drink almost cost $12.  Nearby In-and-Out or Habit give much more burger for less money."}
{"text":"Friendly and professional staff .The place looked clean and organized 
The burger and fries where perfect and very tasty.
Don't think that I waited for more than 5 minutes to have delivered to my table 
Not much more to say than I'll be back"}
{"text":"The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. After walking into this we decided not to eat here"}
{"text":"By far my worst experience at Smash Burger, ever. You can look in my review history and see I don't normally write negative reviews, but this was absurd. From the time we got our receipt for a TO GO order and then got the food 27 minutes later and watching the bag we received, it sat on the counter for 20 minutes before we received it. That's understandable and all, but there were all to go people waiting and no one sitting down that ordered and instead of tending to the food that was waiting for him to bag it, he decided to take a 10 minute break to the rest room and when he came back, instead of tending to the food, he went and cleaned up tables that didn't have anyone waiting on them, with plenty of free open space and no one waiting that ordered for there instead of to go. Normally I'd be reasonable, but this is NOT the Smash Burger experience I've come to know. Not only that, they forgot toppings on each burger, two toppings a piece were left off and everyone's fries were soggy. Something needs to change, because there were a lot of frustrated people waiting on someone to hand their food that was already ready because the employees didn't realize that their first priority is food. Never coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Greasy is an understatement.  

I know they smash their angus beef on the \"griddle\" to seal in the flavor, but I've had much better!  Had the Sin City burger with haystack onions, fried egg, and applewood bacon.  Nice concept, presentation, and yes....very filling!  But the freshness and seasoning of the large patty was blindsided by the greasiness.
SmashFries were better!"}
{"text":"I do like smash burger. However, this location very rarely cleans their tables and you have to ask them to do it. Also, I found a dead dragonfly in my salad. Yes I'm being reimbursed and getting a free burger instead. But that's just gross"}
{"text":"We tried the Sin City burger and the Original burger (both small size) and were happy with the taste and quality of the food. The food came out hot and freshly made just the way I like it. It definitely had not been sitting around waiting to be ordered. The Sin City burger is a must try. The sautéed onions, bacon, along with the creaminess of a fried egg offers a great combination of flavor. And you gotta try it soon, the website says it will be discontinued after Feb. 27, 2017. Bummer! The smashfries are a good addition to the meal. They're thin-cut with a nice hint of rosemary. Very tasty!

The service was also very helpful in making suggestions for first-timers like us."}
{"text":"Food is just ok and the employees I've dealt with are so rude (girls) and if you ask them for anything they act put out."}
{"text":"Stopped here after doing the Voodoo Zipline Ride at the Rio.

The service was friendly and helpful, as Khalilah took our order. I ordered the spicy Baja grilled chicken. He ordered the classic smash burger with spicy fries.

We took our seats and waited for our food. Our food arrived in less than 5 minutes. We were a group of seven. We all enjoyed our burgers. The fries were skinny and too salty."}
{"text":"Their food is a savory overload!!!

Smash burger occasionally sends out coupon promotions where you'd get: $5 off a purchase of $12+, free side with a purchase of entree, and 1/2 off any milkshake. It is good for one coupon per person, per visit so I went with my fiancè where we got to use two out of the three coupons sent to us! 

We ordered a Buffalo & Blue Cheese SmashChicken w/ their SmashFries (olive oil, Rosemary, and garlic), and a Truffle Mushroom SmashBurger w/ fried pickles. We ordered one drink to share since it's free fountain refills and our total without the coupons was about $23. However, we used the $5 off $12 purchase and free side coupon and our total went down to $15, yas! 

It was a crowded dinner night filled with families so we sat against the window on the bar stools. They give you a number stand where they would find you to deliver your food and it took only about 10 minutes before we received everything. The Buffalo & Blue Cheese was super delicious - especially if you're a Buffalo sauce lover like I am. Their fries are very skinny but a good amount of serving, and savory. My fiancès Mushroom burger was another delicious savory entree that complemented the saltiness of the fried pickles. Food taste is 10/10 and portions a 8/10 just because I wasn't full off of their burger and fries combo. 

I would recommend this place, it's so good, great for families. However, parking is a hassle so you might find a parking spot a bit far away from the restaurant."}
{"text":"First Smashburger experience and it will take strong burger craving where EVERY OTHER burger joint is closed nearby for me to return. I like the build your own burger concept but it only works when the person putting the order in gets it right. I had to make a couple trips back to get my order right. When it was all said and done the burger was just fair. For 2 burgers, 2 fries it cost over $20. WAY over priced for what it is."}
{"text":"Food was very good, possibly one of the best burgers we've had. We didn't wait long to get our food at all and even though it's not a sit down restaurant the service and staff were excellent. Everyone was friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since we had been to this location. The young man behind the counter was brand new and you could see the frustration on his face.(I,m sorry you do not leave a new employee on a friday night by himself) it took awhile to get the order straight and finally with some coaching we got thru it, However there were things missing on the order(we said to go) they didn't have that on it and were ready to tray us and not bag us.We specifically said (NO ONION) but that was also missing from the ticket.Fortunately we asked questions and got it straight. The food was so so and the tooth pick type fries were horrendous.. 


Very Upsetting Experience"}
{"text":"The food was great! I got the triple double and he got a bbq burger and they were both really good! The service was 2/10. It was a couple teenagers and they were decently rude. One was a man and one was a woman, I'll still eat here but I'll know the service won't be exceptional."}
{"text":"Really enjoy their Arizona burgers and sweet potato fries. Also had an Oreo milk shake and it was bomb!! Super good place."}
{"text":"Good, standard smash burger. The staff was friendly and helpful and the good was good. Loved the honest tea lemon herbal tea and the green tea."}
{"text":"Stopped by because we were craving a juicy good burger. Fast food didnt sound appealing. So glad I stopped.
The burgers were some of the best. Seasoned and cooked perfectly. They asked if we wanted any pink, I admit I do! We got the spicy jalapeno baja burger without the guacamole and the classic. Loved both. Definitely try the smash fries, soooo good. The shakes I will have to try next time! They looked fantastic ;)
Glad they are close by, makes going next time easier than the other \"fast\" food joints."}
{"text":"I just stood in line with only one person in front of me and waited 15 minutes to not even have my order taken. And what is sad is that there was no manager present to even try to justify I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Smashburger!
I had been out here about a month ago for a Yelp event, and we received a couple free entree coupons.

This weekend, I was craving sweet potato fries like CRAZY, so I convinced my fella that we should go to Smashburger.

We both ordered the Sin City burger (fried egg, bacon, grilled and haystack onions on an egg bun, with cheese and smash sauce.)

The girl who assisted us (Emily? I think?) was very nice, and did a couple substitutions for us with no problem.  (BF subbed goat's cheese instead of the cheddar, and no smash sauce.)  

When the food came out, it was pretty good.  I'd say a step or two above McD's and BK.  The meat wasn't really seasoned at all...but it was cooked well, and the flavors from all the toppings were good.

The sweet potato fries were exactly what I wanted, and were delicious.

We finished off with a salted caramel shake...this alone was worth the trip!  So delicious. 

As far as burger places go, I probably wouldn't drive completely out of my way for it, but prices are good for the quality of the burger, and I would definitely be glad to come back."}
{"text":"Smashburger was pretty good.  The meat was tender and flavorful and the bun was soft and warm.  

This is probably your best option for food in this food court."}
{"text":"My first time eating here was maybe a month ago and I've visited 3 times since then. 3 times in a month! Not because I was too lazy to make dinner, but because the food is so darn good and the customer service is tastefully comparable. I don't remember who helped me at the ALMA SCHOOL Rd location the first time but the second time it was an awesome guy with a great smile named Chris. If I were any hungrier than I was he would have sold me the entire menu. I've never experienced such a friendly and hard pressed up-sell on a milkshake and Chris was correct, it was delicious! I inquired more of the youthful, friendly and outgoing employee (with braces) only  to find out that he is the manager. How befitting. I honestly had never heard of SmashBurger before stumbling upon it in the business shopping center. Now I can't miss it when I'm craving something tasty and substantial. They have an awesome selection of buns too: Egg, multi-grain, whole wheat, etc. And what can I say about those BUFFALO SMASH FRIES?  3 words: Watch-your-calories. The buffalo smash fries are delightful. They are almost shoe-string cut, so the calories seem so small.  The third time we visited this location was last night we were helped by Yasmin. I am all too thrilled to report that Yasmin was just as friendly as Chris. Good representation. Good staffing. Great food! They're literally SMASHING the competition."}
{"text":"These are some greasy burgers! The ingredients and service was quality. The burger was so greasy I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to SmashBurger and it was DELICIOUS. Right off we were greeted by the cashier and she was super nice and had great customer service. 

I had ordered the buffalo and blue cheese and it was SO GOOD with the smash fries. Both are extremely delicious. The place was clean, had a great playlist and had good kids menus. 

If you're looking for a new burger place to try out, I highly suggest SmashBurger."}
{"text":"I LOVE SALT. If you are one of those freaks that doesn't like salt, don't bother coming here - I can't imagine you'd like it very much. 

Sin City Burger (1/3 lb, $5.99) - american cheese, fried egg, bacon, onions (I requested none), and smash sauce (on the side). I can't comment on the bun as I ate this bad boy bunless. The bacon was a bit soggy for my taste (I like crisp bacon), but the egg was PERFECT, and the meat was delicious. Salty, yes, but I can handle that ! Smash sauce wasn't anything special (mayo, mustard and sweet relish), but I snagged some of my coworker's chipotle mayo and that was slammin. When served bunless you don't get a lettuce wrap, which is fine, but would have been a nice touch. 

Veggie Frites ($2.99) - HELL YES. A low carb french fry substitute!! So happy! Carrots, asparagus, and green beans flash fried in oil. Sadly they were a little limp (maybe they could bake them instead to give them more of a satisfying \"crunch?\"), but I'd still order them again. It's pleasing when companies think outside the potato!! 

Overall a nice alternative to my typical In n Out. More toppings, fun sides, and a meatier burger."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with it, but nothing that draws me back, either. 

The meat is good quality. You won't be confusing it for any of the fast-food chains. Of course, you're paying quite a bit more than at any McDonalds/Burger King/Wendys/etc. Standard-size fries and burger is about $10-$11. Add a drink and you're in the $15 range. For a burger.

Oh well."}
{"text":"My coworkers have probably dragged me here like a bazillion of times, and every time this place has delivered an awesome experience. 

The service has always been fast, the staff members has always been funny and friendly!!  They once let us use a bunch of coupons which I don't think was allowed, but they wanted our money so they did it.  We have good high quality money too, crisped and unfolded.  The place has always been super clean, and the restrooms is always kept up. 

I always order their kids meal because it's the exact amount of food I need without making me fall asleep at work afterwards.  Their food is of some quality because it can stay in my body for a while. Usually takes about 3 hours before I do a two.  And their fries is a little thin... but tastes amazing!  And the cheese burger... much better than McDonald's!! It's toasted to perfection.

Overall come here for a kids meal, it's mathematically the right portion of food."}
{"text":"Came into smash burger. 8:30. My meat was red. My gf was too. They must have turned off the burners since it was slow. O well. I'll think about coming back"}
{"text":"The food was super tasty and we were even one of \"those\" customers that comes in 15 minutes before closing but the service from the one girl was amazing! Props to her she deserves a raise or something"}
{"text":"So I don't eat a lot of hamburger meat. But last night I was craving a Bomb hamburger all day yesterday. So I decided to go smashburger cause they have the best hamburgers ever!!! I got the avocado club with mushrooms and hay stacks added. The food was amazing especially the fries with rosemary and olive oil. The one thing I was disappointed in was I did not receive my haystacks and didn't realize till I got home other than that the food and service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Won't be coming back. On a lunch break at 1:00pm and we're gonna stand in line longer to order than it takes us to eat our food. Arrived at 1:00pm with 5-6 couple standing in front of us. It's now 1:17pm and we still have two couple ahead of us. The clerk ringing up orders even left the register to clean tables while other employees didn't seem to care.  I don't get it. Terrible.

Update: paid for our order at 1:24pm. In all fairness the girl at the register was doing double duty because someone called in.  She was pleasant and courteous. Meal arrived at 1:30pm. Just enough time to cram it down and get back to the office."}
{"text":"I only tried the fries, so the rating will just be on that.  I got the Smash Fries, which is the garlic rosemary fries.  It was pretty good, I like skinny fries.  But the greasiness made the fries not as crispy as it looked like it should be.  Maybe next time I can try a burger also."}
{"text":"Very high quality and very fresh for fast food. Their Arizona burger is fantastic with habenero cheese and jalapenos. I also like the way they season the smash fries with sea salt, rosemary and olive oil."}
{"text":"So does anyone else think the logo looks a bit like GameStop's?
So you walk into this restaurant and are immediately enveloped by one of the best smells ever. My mouth was immediately watering and I went from being slightly hungry to starving in like 3 seconds flat.
I had the half pound (which is BIG) BBQ, bacon burger with no substitutions and smashfries.
The burger was really good. Like REALLY good. The crisp onion straws were very flavorful and the bun was delicious. I just wish the BBQ sauce had a bit of a kick to it. 
The fries were good, however I think I would have enjoyed the regular french fries more. 
Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Feeling the carnal need for a burger I thought I'd give smashburger a try.  

Yes the burgers were alright and I quite enjoyed the thin cut fries which were perfectly crispy.  But given the hype and rather premium price they only get 2  stars."}
{"text":"A joyless meal, a dry beef patty, gummy bread, a flavorless burger despite a range of potentially interesting toppings. Thin little fries that must be consumed immediately as they quickly lose heat.

Milkshakes were alright but but I was fiending anyway, so I wasn't as discerning about it. 

Hype  unsubstantiated."}
{"text":"Smashburger is great and this location is my favorite!  Nice and clean, with friendly staff. I've come here very early a few times and they didn't look annoyed to serve their first burger of the day. 

As far as my favorite...the BBQ Bacon Cheese Smashburger with Sweet Potato Smash Friesh. Omg!"}
{"text":"We go to this place every Friday for lunch. normally the line up is out the door! The burgers are great! they have an awesome selection. and will cater to any allergies (gluten for me) The place is normally very busy! so grab a seat as soon as you get there! some times it can be hard to get a seat and thats the only thing stopping them from a 5/5 rating!"}
{"text":"With all the burger joints lining camelback rd nowadays it is easy to find a great burger, The trick is finding one that doesn't cost $15 dollars. Sure there are plenty of fast food restauraunts, but if you want a freshly prepared burger for 5 bucks give smashburger a shot. There beef was good quality, the fries and onion rings were great... In my opinion this place is as good or better than both delux and the grind when you consider price."}
{"text":"Had my first Smash Burger while on a road trip in Vegas, and it was great.  Haystack onions and crispy sweet potato fries with rosemary rocked!"}
{"text":"Glorious smashed meat topped with applewood smoked bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato on a grilled gluten-free bun (Udi's brand). Served with a side of shoestring smash fries - tossed with a bit of olive oil and herbs - made for a great quick meal. 

Too much food, so stuffed, but so worth it."}
{"text":"The black bean burger is great, but the customer service here is lacking!! They do not seem to care about their jobs. However, the Black Bean Burger Baja Style is worth it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that not every aspect of my visit to this establishment was horrible. The staff at this location are very nice.

On October 8 2017, I decided that i would go to Smash Burger and grab dinner for myself and my family as I had a 25 dollar gift card that I received for my birthday two weeks prior. Upon entering the establishment, I was greeted by the staff who took my order. I ordered a Sin City Burger, a chicken club, and two double triple or triple double burgers ( not sure of the name) with fries, to go.

Upon bringing my food home, myself and my family began to eat the food, only to find that each of the sandwiches we're so salty it was like eating a salt lick. As the food was inedible, I ended up throwing the sandwiches away, and was forced to was money on a pizza that I did not want to purchase. 

Later on that night I completed the review on the company website, where I had informed them of the issue. The next day I receive an e-mail from Smash Burger's Market Captain, Joesph Zappala, apologizing for the overly salted food and promising to rectify the mistake if I sent an e-mail with my home address back to him, to which I did.

I am person who is patient and is willing to give a business a second chance if they had only kept their word. However, now I will not now or ever eat at another Smash Burger again, and I will also share the e-mail I received with other media outlets, so that they may encourage others to not eat at Smash Burger."}
{"text":"There's really nothing wrong with smash burger... It's just not amazing. After seeing the lines out the door we had to see what we were missing. I was underwhelmed by the burger it was really thin and just kind of lacking flavor. The people were really nice and helpful but that wasn't enough to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"On a street with an In 'n' Out, a Create, and about sixteen chain burger places,  I wasn't sure why we ever needed to go here -- except for SCIENCE.  Science is what makes us discover all sorts of great things -- infrared radiation or that new Thai place.   Sometimes science just ends up finding disappointment, like here at SmashBurger.  

I'm not entirely sure what this place is doing, it promised a gourmet burger and garlic fries but really all I ended up with was a 15-minute wait and some little chisel sticks.  The jalapeno burger wasn't at all and was missing vital parts, like spice.

Science is dangerous!  This was just another failed experiment so that you can get a real gourmet burger elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Had a recommendation from an airport employee saying I had to try Alberta beef if I was visiting (not sure this is the best option? but still a great burger).

I had the Jalapeno Baja burger and Smash Fries. The beef was great, toppings were stellar (guacamole, fresh sliced jalapenos and chipotle mayo), and the bun was tasty. 

The Smash Fries were similar to shoestring fries, with a rosemary seasoning. They were great with red wine vinegar or ketchup (or both!).

I also appreciated the selection of different iced teas to choose from. 

Very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Best $6 burger around. Smash fries and fried pickles are excellent. Always friendly and fast service. Great place for a burger, fries, and a shake for just a few bucks more than In N Out!"}
{"text":"a shout out for fast and tasty food....We only had 35 minutes to get our food and eat before we headed to the movies...out in 10 minutes and it was good!   We had visited another smashburger in August and was very unimpressed!  But the Happy Valley Location has made us a fan...so much so that my husband two days later said...\"Lets go eat there again that was the best burger I've had in a long time.\""}
{"text":"Okay . . . I returned to see if the Smash Fires would bump the stars up to Five . . . Had the Sweet Potato Smash Fries . . . AND . . . they did it.

Just for the record . . . I did have the Mushroom Swiss Smash Burger again . . . and it was just like the first.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Out of all the fast food place - one of the better choices. The Classic Smashburger is always a great choice...  Now, it's nothing special, but it is as good as you would expect walking in."}
{"text":"I bought Groupon and had a dinner there. My husband was impressed by good ground beef they use and enjoyed cherry coke too. He probably will give 4 stars. I had Classic burger with guacamoli and mushroom, sweet potato fries and drink since I can spend $12. They charge $1.99 each for 1Tbsp of guacamoli and 6 slices sauteed mushroom, LOL The sweet potato fries taste like what Trader Joe's carries. I think it's almost like Carl's Jr.'s $6 burgers. I may visit again when I got Groupon."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend and decided to take advantage of the outdoor seating so my dogs could join us. Got the BBQ Bacon & Cheddar with smash fries. There were parts of my burger that were a little on the pink side, which I wasn't thrilled about, and it was all pretty greasy/oily, but I guess that's pretty normal for Smashburger."}
{"text":"Smashburger is the best combination of quality, deliciousness, and price that I've ever encountered. The food is both delicious and high quality, and the price is crazy cheap. You can get a burger, fries, and drink at Smashburger cheaper than McDonald's, yet the quality is going to be better than almost any other hamburger place. Not sure how they do it, but I love it."}
{"text":"36 minutes for two (non-custom) burgers and two fries. Watched the food Tetris at the kitchen window the whole time, bags under the heat lamp, then out... unwrap something... move to another bag... no explanation. \"Sorry about the wait\"... really? The food's barely warm and fries aren't fresh..."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced for the airport, service was great, and my burger came out so fast it actually burned my tongue (I'm gonna take the blame for that). I could not, however, get over how much this tastes like Fatburger, which made me really miss Fatburger in Phoenix, and also made me drop SmashBurger a star for being unoriginal. Great Burger. Did I mention I miss Fatburger in the valley?"}
{"text":"A word to the wise..the KIDS, and I do mean kids,  that were \"working\", and I use that term loosely, on Friday, the 1st, really need to be trained, and retrained.
My party of 4 entered this establishment at 5:50 PM.  There was no one in line.  Some young fellow with hair down in front of us eyes was speaking with a young lady as we waited to order.
And waited.....another staff member strolled out of the kitchen and proceeded to make a shake, which she consumed herself, as we waited....and waited.  It was laughable as the original young fellow, (remember him) finally came over to let us know that they were very shorthanded and it would be, and I quote, \"at least eleven minutes until someone would be AVAILABLE,  to take our order!\"
At that time,  each in our party of 4 laughed, and then we proceeded to the In and Out Burger a short distance from the Smashburger.
Of course the order was promptly taken, and we were eating in a reasonable amount of time.
If I EVER am seen going into Smashburger, please tackle me, and NEVER let me enter into that sad excuse of a restaurant.
I am happy that I have not even one share of stock in that corporation, and I feel sorry for anyone that does.
'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"So gross- 2 to 3 inch hair in the burger.  Reading others reviews it's happen to others.  

Makes my stomach turn.  It honestly looked pube liked... Just missing the curly Qs."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give us 5 stars cuz the food is great. And even though it was SUPER SLOW tonight .. The staff is working hard to overcome!!"}
{"text":"Smashburger has one of the best black bean burgers out there, and might be the fairest in all the land. I'm used to being presented with black bean burgers that are prepacked/frozen. Not so at Smashburger! I've no idea how they make their veggie burgers, but you can definitely tell that it's fresh. The patty itself is \"smashed\" and spills over the circumference of the bun. Word to the wise - Nibble the edges of the patty before going all in. The burger is crumbly and has an unexpected sea salt taste to it. 

Spicy Jalapeno Baja ($6.99) - This, right here, is my...burger! Be prepared to have your face melted off because those jalapenos are HOT! 

Smashfries ($1.99): Full Disclosure here - the fries can be hit or miss. Sometimes they're drenched in oil and other times, they're perfectly delicious. It is what it is! 

Customer service is always exceptional. 

Smashburger can get a little pricey for a burger joint, but here's some pro tips on how to get more bang for your buck:

* This location has a military discount! Show your ID and you get free fountain drinks
* If you fill out the survey on the bottom of the receipt, you get a free side
* There's a yelp check-in offer for 10% of your order
* If you join the Smashclub, you get emailed coupon offers to save $$
* If you enter your phone number at the register, you get points. Once you reach 100 you get a free burger.

{"text":"No fries? Really? I have been to about five different Smash Burger locations, but the one at Norterra on Happy Valley seems to have a disproportionate number of problems. Today, they have no fries. Other times have been other problems. Generally the food is pretty good, but no fries??? Really? I will avoid this location."}
{"text":"I love the smash burger chain. My husband I were regulars in Colorado. I don't know if it's because this one is in Vegas so it sucks but the service is slow. 
My main beef with this Smash is when you check in on yelp they give you a 10% coupon towards your meal, they don't accept that anymore!!!! We got to the cashier and she said \"actually, we stopped doing that\". Really? Maybe you should make it so it doesn't pop up anymore. 
Just frustrated. The food was good so I can't complain on that. Just big on delivering what they promise. 
And... No soap in the bathrooms!!!!
And they bring out the food seperately... Cuz I want to eat in front of my husband while he just watches me... 
And the trash cans haven't been emptied in a while... Just displeased."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  There were so many people, and no idea why.  Ordered a salad with chicken but no chicken with it.  Expensive for a small portion.  Ran out of silverware.  Staff are very nice.  Just cannot afford the prices and the food was a letdown.  Very clean.  The menu board was upside down and the cash register shut down, which they say is common."}
{"text":"I went back after being contacted by Smashburger, and overall it was a much better experience. Obviously Smashburger takes feedback and constructive criticism seriously. When I went back a week ago, the fries were really hot and not at all oily as in my previous few trips. The burger was juicy and delicious and when I ordered it without bread (I'm GF), I didn't have to ask for silverware. I'm really happy things have gotten better here!"}
{"text":"Pretty unimpressive.  For $8 I get a mediocre burger and french fries?  I don't think so."}
{"text":"This smash burger here located on Fort Apache is very clean and they have great deals. The service is very fast and friendly . and the food is fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I visited this location with my family and enjoyed the burger and salted caramel milkshake. The burger seasoning was delicious and the shake hit the sweet spot. On my second visit, I was disappointed to find that the floor was littered with napkins and other trash even though it was later in the afternoon and there weren't that many people there. Needless to say I was wondering if the public part of the restaurant was such a mess, I wondered what the kitchen looked like. A little leery about visiting again."}
{"text":"I really like Smashburger, but I have a problem with it, as well.

I can't order anything else when I eat here other than the AZ burger and rosemary-garlic fries.

There are a lot of burger joints out there, but one thing that sets Smashburger apart is the level of service. 

You order, pour your own drink, then take your number and put it on your table and your meal is served to you with a smile. It gets busy at lunch hour but the staff deals with the rush pretty efficiently. 

During my most recent visit, someone in my party got a chicken salad with no chicken in it. When she told the manager about this, he promptly offered to grill her a chicken breast and apologized. On her way out, the manager also presented her with a coupon for a free sandwich on her next visit. 

Accountability. Nice!"}
{"text":"We had been to Smashburger in Ohio before and wanted to go back remembering how great it was the first time.
The menu is the same, though they do always have a \"local\" burger, here the sin city which my husband got with a fried egg,  applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun.
As well as a make your own and some smash fries tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.
I had a make your own veggie burger on a multigrain bun, veggie fries which are flash-fried carrot sticks and green beans AND a harvest salad with fresh greens, balsamic tomatoes, raisins, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and blue cheese topped with balsamic vinaigrette, no blue cheese, add guac.
YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
Way too much food, the salads at $5.99 are HUGE!
SO fresh, def enough, the burger great, black bean, very tasty.
Veggie fries, also tasty.
My son got a kids meal, also generous in size, we paid just under $40 for a ton of food.
The restaurant is super clean, everyone here is really on top of their game and offer fantastic service.
You get fresh and healthy food for a fast food price, that just can't be beat!
The manager checked on us often, he was great, I like the open kitchen, I need a Smashburger closer to home, they really are THAT good!"}
{"text":"I would encourage you to try a DIFFERENT place if you want a burger. The burgers and fries were just very mediocre. Just pass, never again!"}
{"text":"Came back in a 2nd time and was not all that impressed. I ordered the bacon cheddar double combo sandwich was a little dry. The smash frys amazing. The 2nd sandwich I ordered.was the truffel michrrom cheese burger with a chicken paty as well. I asked for there be extra mushroom and truffle sause on the sandwich and grilled onions. And tryed pickles. When I got home I realized they put the mushrooms and onions in a cup and did not put any extra truffle sause on my sandwich. Thr whole thing was dry it was awful.  The chicken was way over cooked.to the point it tasted burnt.  Very disappointed in my experiences."}
{"text":"Omg this is my official favor burger joint in mesa. I forgot the name of the cheese burger I orders. It was on a egg bun with this creamy special sause and had sauteed mushrooms grilled onions and spinach on the top. OMG CAN I SAY MOUTH WATERING. I also got there Rosemary smash fries if you have not tried them it is definitely a must. And there ranch us surprisingly really good, I would know because im a ranch snob"}
{"text":"This place is clean, our order came out fast, it was piping hot and delicious. I had never been to a Smashburger before so it was a gamble. I ordered a bbq bacon burger and a chocolate malt and both were perfect. My 3yo son was goofing with one of the employees while she was picking up orders and delivering them to customers and she was goofing with him right back. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We used to love this Smashburger location, however, the several times that we have visited over the past year it seems to get progressively dirtier. The bathrooms tonight were filthy and gross (again). The dining room looks like it needs a good scrubbing down. The food seems to have slid in quality over the past 12 months as well. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place and their burgers, but for Pete's sake, could you please actually put more than the equivalent of 2/3 of a slice of bacon on your bacon and avocado burger, please? I've addressed this with managers at multiple locations and still, the chintzy portions. SMH"}
{"text":"I finally received the smashbucks a while back. I have yet to use them, but we did stop by the other day to give it another go (I didn't have them with me). Service was much better than the first time around. Order came out correct. Unfortunately, we were still underwhelmed by the burgers. As I stated the first time around the onion rings were very good. Sorry Smashburger, I guess it wasn't meant to be."}
{"text":"What a week!  2 truly awesome speciality hamburger places have opened, Clive on 17th Ave SW and Smashburger on 32 Ave NE!  

Smashburger is part of a popular US chain from Denver, a lot like Five Guys Burger and Fries and Fatburger, but with a bit of a difference.  Smash is dedicated to be the best local burger joint in each city it's in.  As such, they added some nice touches to a Canadian Burger that reeks of Alberta, and ESPECIALLY the wicked ice cream shake using the ever rocking McKay's ice cream.  

As for the name... well, get a baseball-size ball of fresh meat, and then smash the sucker onto a reeeeeaaally hot grill to sear it quickly and seal in those yummy moo juices.  Once done, add some nifty sauces, toppings (love the fried onions) and put it on a great fresh bun, and you have the Smashburger burger.

When I went, the line up went right out the door, and I have no doubt it'll be that way right through lunch for years.  

Oh, and a especial nod to a certain fellow vegan Yelper Sarah Louise F., they have a BLACK BEAN based VEGETARIAN burger.  I haven't tried it yet, but I'm curious to see what'll be your take on it!"}
{"text":"Sooooooooo yummy!!! today was my first time going to smash burger and I loved it!the burger was cooked perfectly. The people who work there are nice and helpful. I WOULD recommend this place for a nice quick yummy lunch!"}
{"text":"Smash Burger is a great place to grab a great avocado burger or a spinach chicken salad with a side of string bean fries! Excellent service."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening and order the Sin city burger (6.99), Avocado club crispy chicken (6.99), and smash fries (1.99) for $9.79 (used the BOGO hamburger deal exp 8/27/13)

- Next to UNLV. Be careful, when we got there, 3 cop cars had to pull over a car across the street from this place! Friday night commotion! haha. 
- Fast service. We got our burgers in less than 10 min. Fresh. 
- Sin City burger was delicious. Anything with bacon and a fried egg makes it an instant hit! 
- Avocado club lacked much avocado but the crispy chicken was mmm mm good! Better than Chick Fil-A. Amazing! 
- French fries were cut thin. Had better fries, but still good. 
- Free shake on your bday. Sign up. 
- Great casual fast burger Joint! 
- In terms of the Burger (not fries): 1) Smash 2) Habit 3) Five Guys. Controversial list!"}
{"text":"I really liked everything we got. We got the sin city, smash fries and jalapeño chicken sandwich. The sin city was very salty tho so if u don't like salt I don't recommend it. Or put the sauce on the side. Also the cashier was rude and she was not helpful at all. She acted like we were taking up her precious time and there wAs no one waiting behind us. I really liked their selection of drinks. They have honest teas, coke products and vitamin water w acai Pom and blueberry. Very yummy."}
{"text":"I went with colleague and we loved their burgers. Very friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"The avocado chicken club is life! I have found most of the other things to be a little greasy but it still tastes good."}
{"text":"I had a violent craving for french fries and didn't feel like going the Mc Donald's, Five Guys or In n Out route.  I ordered a Mushroom Swiss burger and garlic herb fries.  

The burger was alright but I noticed I was given plain fries.  My fries went back to the kitchen and a few minutes later I got fries soaking in oil.  It did not taste like garlic nor herb.  It was mushy, oily and gross. Plain YUCK!

I was absolutely disappointed and wished I went to Mickey D's or In n Out instead!  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I was driving down the strip and ran into this Hamburger gem.  Fantastic burgers and the service was great. Especially Kayla, she was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Update: I decided to give them another try, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Service was much more pleasant and attentive. Also the quality is night and day better than the last time I was here almost a year ago, my meal actually looked delicious this time.  Thank you and keep up the good work by improving every day!"}
{"text":"Smash burger is one of those chains that is kind of not like a chain if you know what I mean.  It has a homemade feel to it similar to what u would find at a mom and pop place but clearly it's not.  But. Don't take this as a let down because this place has some pretty tasty burgers!

I had the Arizona burger it had habanero cheese, jalapenos and a spicy sauce.  The burger wasn't as hot as it sounds but pretty tasty.  The meat was mouth watering and the freshness did show.

We shares some smash fries they were ok kind if greasy but not too bad.  

Overall I would recommend this as the burger spot on the west side.  If your out and about over here give it a shot.  

Oh and they do have beer."}
{"text":"Burgers here are good - cooked after you order them and delivered hot and fresh. The ingredients are likewise fresh -- get the Arizona burger ... It has fresh jalapeño slices on it.

Also good are the salads -- spinach and goat cheese with balsamic is excellent... Add a chicken breast for some extra protein.

I find the black bean 'veggie' burger to be tasty but a little dry and difficult to eat: it falls apart before you can get it into your face.

You can get any burger 'big' if you want it a little bigger."}
{"text":"Heard so many good things about smash burger so headed down to try.  Burgers are fresh and decent size but really nothing to write home about.  Definitely better quality than your average fast food place.. but very comparable to a restaurant burger without all the fuss of a full service place.  They do serve the food to you after ordering at the counter.. but other than that I might have to stick with Freddy's or in and out."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! I had been told by several friends that I just *had to try Smashburger. Well, the husband and I did and it did not disappoint.

Let's get right to the good stuff - the burger. Oh, boy! Juicy, chargrilled flavor. The regular, Smash (1/3 pound, I think) was perfect. I got mine with pepperjack cheese and the spicy chipotle mayo. Delish! And you have to try the Smash Fries. I've never had anything like them - the olive oil and rosemary give them a very upscale flavor. The husband also got a banana pudding milkshake - creamy and rich. No complaints there.

Atmosphere was not what I expected - for all the raving I'd heard I expected something similar to Big Daddy's. But no. It's a grab a menu at the door, order at the register, grab a number & a table and wait for someone to bring out your food sort of place. Decor is minimalist and trendy - very bright. Inviting, but not somewhere you're going to linger, which, I guess is the point.
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff here are always amazing they are friendly poliet and do a great job keeping the shop looking great. The food is yet to dissapoint always fresh hot and juicy ! And the fried pickles oh god amazing"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the employee s that work at this establishment. 1st and foremost if you are picking up trash from the floor you should always wash your hands before you touch the Togo bags. 2nd if you are using a cleaning rag from a bucket with cleaning chemicals you should wash your hands before touching a Togo bag.I wonder what the health department would say about this....."}
{"text":"What an absolute waste of money. You could honestly get a more impressive burger at McDonald's. I thought I accidentally order a kids burger due to its small size but then I saw my sons burger which looked like something out of a \"little tikes\" child's fake kitchen. But even those look juicy. My black bean burger looked like smashed green and blue playdoh painted black and had too much salt on it to even eat. On top of that the goat cheese on my spinach and goat cheese burger was literally the size of a penny. Maybe they should spend less money on fancy Coke machines and little smash burger flags through the middle of your burger and a little more money on meat. Do yourself a favor and go to burger kind McDonald's bad daddy's your own home literally anywhere but this poor excuse for a burger joint."}
{"text":"My first visit to a smashburger was a flop.  Went to this location with two friends in late June.   Pros:  Place was very clean, cashier was friendly.  Great milkshakes.

Red flag.  There was only one other table with customers, this was at noon on a weekday.  

Cons:  Burger was ready 2 minutes after we ordered, meaning it must have been sitting in a holding bay.  It was barely luke-warm, and was overcooked.  Bun was cold (as if just removed from refrigerator).  Tomato/lettuce were tiny and not fresh (opposite of what you get an in and out).  Fries were terrible, seemed to have been sitting out for a while (not hot)."}
{"text":"Smashburger is delicious and fast! Dakota is wonderful and makes this place even better. Awesome customer service and attention to detail. Makes us wish we all had coworker like Dakota"}
{"text":"Since it's pricey here, I just get the kids meal. The burger is pretty much the same size as the all American. The fried pickles are pretty good. I would rather go to IN n OUT though."}
{"text":"was in the area so decided to check out Smashburger.  I went in before the lunch rush so can't judge how the service was, the place was empty around 11am. Looked clean although there was some noise going on - an employee banging on something, have no idea what it was, a machine or icemaker or something.  Who knows?  Anyway, I chose the BBQ burger with bacon and cheese. Regular size. Also had a side of haystack onions. Order was done quickly and took it to go.  Okay, here's my opinion on this burger.  I liked the bun - a nice change from the typical fast food bun, so that was nice.  The bacon had a nice flavor, and I thought the burger itself was well balanced in terms of BBQ, cheese and onions (maybe a bit low on onions but not too bad).  Here's the bad part:  my burger was pink in places. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and definitely would have had it well done as I do NOT eat hamburger meat with ANY pink in it whatsoever.  (and yes, a burger can be cooked well done without drying out, if I can do it at home for myself, a professional cook ought to be able to).  So, I was unhappy and grossed out by the pink areas. Various people have said the food is greasy.  I didn't find that to be a problem.  In fact, I like a burger with a bit of grease sheen, so that was a plus for me. I did find the haystack onions to be on the salty side.  Not horribly so but a bit more saltiness than I would like (was rather thirsty after finishing the meal).  The meat itself in the burger didn't taste all that wonderful.  Just so so, a bit more quality than a typical fast food McD's type thing, but not soooo much that it knocked me out.  There were bites that just didn't taste that wonderful.  And every now and then the haystack onions had a bit \"off\" flavor also (like old oil).  Would I go here again?  Probably not.  If they lowered everything on the menu by a dollar, maybe.  I understand what they are aiming for, a somewhat higher quality burger than fast food, but until they can cook a burger without leaving pink in it, I would never eat here again.  It's a shame because they are on the right track somewhat, but like so many places, they aren't quite there, and in this economy, leaving with a bill of over $8.00 for one person, for two items, is probably not going to bring back a lot of people.  They seemed friendly from the way I was greeted, so no complaints there, but like I say, it was early in the day and no one else was there.  I'd like them to succeed but at lower prices and fully COOKING the meat, then they might get a loyal customer :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I have to say I was impressed. Each state has their own special SmashBurger burger. I'm in Arizona, and theirs is pretty good! 

The service was great! The lady at the counter was able to answer all of my questions and give me her recommendations, which was really helpful. After we ordered we sat down at our table and talked, and when our food was ready they brought it to our table rather than making us go get it. They also came by and asked us if we needed anything and brought us some refills. When you are done eating you just leave your trays on your table, which is really nice. 

The Arizona burger was great! It was the perfect combination of flavor and spice.  I also got the sweet potato fries and they were super good and salty. 

Overall I really enjoyed it and I'm glad I chose SmashBurger for my quick dinner. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"The week of grand opening I finally came here to eat during lunch. Finally we have a Smashburger near my work! Food here is great! But today, instead of fries, I got the fried pickles...not a huge fan. If you like pickles, you might like it!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. The wait was long and when we got our orders home the burgers were so over cooked. It was like chewing into a piece of crispy bacon and it tasted awful. On the chicken sandwiches they mixed the ingredients. Put cheese where we didn't want it and used condiments we didn't order. Tried to call them when we got home but they don't answer the phone and could only leave a message. Guess they want us to write this negative review instead! Other customers also had problems with the wrong orders and left very agitated. We will never go back there again and we had been there at least 20 times previously and never had this kind of experience. TERRIBLE! Stay away!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE Smashburger!  As a first timer I was totally head over heels for this place.  A million people had told me how good it was and I finally got to see for myself. 

The angus burgers are ridiculously amazing.  You can choose a build-your-own or from one of their delicious menu options.  I loved the one with the fried egg.  There are awesome fry options including regular fries, sweet potato fries, and smash fries (rosemary, olive oil and garlic), which are a great alternative to the plain ones.  You can even get a side of the haystack onions.  Yes, please!  They serve milkshakes, which I can't wait to try.  I love that they give them to you plus the extra leftover in the milkshake cup.  I got asked for a water cup and they even cut their straws in half to fit the size of the smaller cup. 

Prices are good. A little more expensive than in n Out and I think it just depends on what you're in the mood for - I can't say one is better than the other.  

I wish there were more of these around the valley!  I will be back to try many more burger combos!"}
{"text":"It's okay. The burgers are creative, the turnaround time is quick and the customer service is great..... But the burger meat is mediocre. I guess if you pay the upcharge the burger may be more substantial, but the regular priced burger is no difference in size than that from McDonald's ( which has better fries.) The fried pickles are also very (too?) salty"}
{"text":"Beef, chicken, turkey, or vegetarian. This is a great burger place. The food is freshly cooked and shows up to you hot. Even right now at 12pm we got two orders right away and it isn't crowded in here. About half-full of customers. Staff is very polite and knowledgeable of their job and the place is clean. There's also a good selection of drinks if you don't want fountain soda, including beer. If eating outside is your thing they have a small area for that as well. My favorite Smashburger."}
{"text":"I had to stop in here today and give it another go it's been a few years since I've tried this I think last time I was at a Smashburger it was probably the day after a long night of drinking. Now that my single party days are behind me I realize I must have just been super hung over because I've was very happy with the service and burger here today although I do agree with one review I read about burgers being as big as the lead you to believe but I think it's just fine how it is. Still won't pick this over shake SHAK but then again I'm not always near a shake SHAK either."}
{"text":"I dont agree with People Saying Go Next Door to In & Out. Thats Rubbish. In & Out doesnt have the selection. And the prices arent much different. The Sin City burger doesnt dissapoint. I had the Smash fries with the rosemary olive oil. Delicious. The line moved fast and our food came out quickly. Im From Colorado and they keep up the quality of food in diff states which is good. The Lack of people at In & Out Speaks for itself. My only complaint is we had to use a napkin to wipe down our booth."}
{"text":"Have frequented this location off and on the past three years. For what it is the food is always good and the staff is always friendly. Never had any issues here and my kids always enjoy coming when we do. Place is great if you don't want fast food but don't have the time for a big sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Simply stated..............a GREASY burger from start to finish..

NOT 4 me....This place I will avoid while I continue on to a real good burger joint.!!"}
{"text":"Some of the friendliest service we received on our trip to Vegas. The woman at the country was smiling, kind, and happy to explain certain parts of the menu or offer suggestions.

I opted for the big smash Burger and smash fries. The burger was solid. Probably a 3-3.5. better than most fast for places. The meat was slightly charred, but not overly crispy. The bacon was cooked perfectly and the haystacks were great. The egg unfortunately was cooked over hard. I didn't ask for sunny side up, but didn't get asked on preference either so I'm not sure if they typically do this. The fries were ok. Good flavor, but I'm not a fan of shoe string fries."}
{"text":"I went here hoping to get a delicious burger , while they werent bad they kind of lacked flavor. Also I was hoping that the smash fries would have more of an intense flavor, fried pickles were good! The staff was friendly. Overall, this place is just pretty forgettable and honestly won't find myself craving it often!"}
{"text":"So, what part of NO SALT don't you undersand?

My partner arrived at 5:00 today & handed the cashier a slip of paper for 2 burgers (made the same way), 1 order of onion rings, & circled were the words \"no salt.\"  But when he reminded her \"there isn't any salt, is there?\", she said \"Whoops!  He'll have to re-make them.\"

This is repeatedly the mistake made at Sahara Smashburger & we're done with it.  Not only the salt problem, but the onion fries were swimming in oil &, therefore, quite tasteless.

Chefs in this town better get hip about how salt is contributing to unhealthy Americans.  We all have salt shakers or packets in our cars, so leave YOUR hands off the salt!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were really excited to try Smashburger. As far as the quality of food we were really impressed. They have a very good bun(we had the egg bun and the chipotle bun) compared to other burger restaurants. To me the burger itself did not standout but the overall flavor profile of my burger was delisious(the spicy burger). I had the sweet potato smash fries, the regular fries, and fried pickles also and we thought these were also delicious. Lastly my wife wanted to share a nutterbutter shake to which we both thought was deliscious but for nearly $5 it was on the small side. The atmosphere was great and overall customer service was on par with everything else in the area. We would eat there again for sure!"}
{"text":"When our food came out it was good.  We had to wait about 25 minutes for our food.  There was only 3 people in line in front of us.  We sat and watched 5 people in the kitchen who all looked very confused. There was a gentleman collecting and delivering each meal to tables who evidentally was confused about each order.  A girl came from the kitchen to straighten it all out.  Meanwhile, there were 4 to go orders waiting and watching with us for theirs.  Everyone who received something looked sceptical and checked what was in each of their bags before leaving.  We all made eye contact at one point or another.  I think they need management at this location."}
{"text":"1/3 lb Bbq bacon cheeseburger was very delicious. the fries were pretty basic but that burger was incredible. i heard talk for years about how great fatburger,jack in the box are on the west coast but they were lousy compared to this place. Imo. Its comparable to five guys burger and fries.(philly)"}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Hulk Smash!!! - They really do smash the patty pretty flat. I ordered a 1/2 lb. burger and it was a good half inch larger than the bun. It also creates a slight burnt crisp to the edge of the patty that tasted good.
       - Taste to Guilt Ratio - The flavor of the burger is amazing, but it's also incredibly greasy. I wouldn't recommend for anyone on a diet.
       - Price - The price is comparable to other non fast food burger joints like Fatburger, Create, and Five Guys. Price being equal, I'd definitely shell out my Hamilton to clog my arteries at Smash Burger.
**Price**
       - $10 - $12 for a burger, fries, and a drink.
**Ordered**
       -  1/2 lb. Sin City Smash Burger - One of the best burgers I've had. It features a fried egg, bacon, haystack onions on an egg bun. The patty is smashed flat so it's a lot larger than the bun. The fried egg wasn't runny and it combined with the rest of the fixins to make a delicious heart attack.
       -  Smash Fries - Rosemary, olive oil and garlic added to fries does seems strange at first, but the flavor of rosemary is unexpected and tasty.
       -  Haystack Onions - Pretty much string thin onion rings with a chipotle mayo sauce. I didn't really like the sauce too much, but I don't really like chopotle mayo.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd definitely recommend this place if you like burgers. It's truly a step above your average fast food burger with the higher prices to prove it."}
{"text":"Smashburger provides absolutely fantastic tasting burgers. There is a great deal of flavor in each burger and it's delicious. The bun is great, the cheese is great, the burger is great. The smash fries are really quite good as well, though they can get just a BIT oily.

$10 buys you a burger, fries, and drink, with tax, which is firmly right near Five Guys and Chuckbox. I'm a MUCH bigger fan of Smashburger than Five Guys, and it's neck-and-neck, burger-quality with Chuckbox. (They're different flavors, and Chuckbox's mesquite-grilling goes a LONG way, but their fries are freezer fries and bleh.)

The staff is very friendly, they typically hit their 5-7 minute statement, and it's one of my favorite burgers anywhere now. Definitely a good place."}
{"text":"One word review: Overhyped. The long version: The place was clean, and the service was fast and friendly, but the food is overpriced mediocritize. Trying to eat a little healthier, I opted for the chicken. The sandwich was ok. Good size, with plenty of topping options, but nothing much above average. The fries were shoestrings. Great if you are courting the under 10 crowd, but odd for a premium burger place. All in all you can get the same, or better quality food at In n Out Burger down the street, for half the price. A chicken/vegeburger option isn't enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"I love me some Smashburger. Food is always fast and fresh and the service is always friendly. My favorite is the SinCity. Great fried egg burger and go for the smash fries to top it off."}
{"text":"i normally like this place, but I was very upset when my burger had a soggy bun, nothing turns you off than a soggy bun. Yukk."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for awhile and I just don't see it. Will take Five Guys over this place anytime. The hamburger wasn't horrible, just so greasy, it was running down my arm. I would expect this at the Heart Attack grill. We also ordered the chili cheese fries. Was told it was enough for two people, and there was three of us, so got one order. That order of fries was about the size of a medium at McDonalds, and it was not much different from McDonalds either. (other than the chili and cheese) For the price paid, ($33 for 3 hamburgers, drinks and 1 fries, I will pass on this place and head for Carls Jr or jack in the Box!"}
{"text":"Update:
In my last post I raved about this place.  I haven't been back in a while, but I went today for lunch and was highly disappointed. 

The service was terrible. The guy taking our order wasn't friendly. He actually asked if we would be ok if someone behind us could go in front of us. The guy who was busing wasn't friendly. He was trying to carry too many plates and dropped some and was unhappy with himself. The girl bringing out food was fairly rude. She asked if we needed anything else. I asked for more of the haystack onion sauce. She brought me some mayo then I didn't see her again after that. She also refused to make eye contact. 

Now if the service was terrible, but the food was delicious as always I could say oh well bad day. The food was no good. My haystack onions were about half the size as I have had every other time I've been here. They were so greasy it was disgusting. The bottom third was just crumbs, so I couldn't even eat it. The burger was basically flavorless. 

I was so disappointed I had to write an updated review. I will give it another try to see if maybe today was an off day, but wow no more raving for me :/"}
{"text":"Best Smashburger I've ever had! I've had smashburger at a couple other places but this location is really good!"}
{"text":"Don't let the 2-stars fool you.  Smashburger makes a great burger.  The problem I have is I don't believe it's worth the price.  You can get a burger of equal quality beef down at Inglewood Drive-In for less.  You have to buy the side orders separately or pay a premium for a combo.

The fries were really salty and I'm not a fan of how thin they are.  I eat about 4-5 at a time which makes me look like a pig.  If I ate them one at a time I'd be there for 2 hours.  However, I love their egg wash buns!  The service was great as about 4-5 times during our meal we were asked if we wanted anything.  The air quality wasn't very good in there.  It had a noticeably greasy smell to it.  Having asthma it didn't help at all.  When we left our clothes smelled of grease.

I'd go back again but only if I felt like splurging."}
{"text":"Food was not good, fried disgusting, service Pour, tv  menu broken, bathroom holder broken. Won't be back"}
{"text":"You gotta try the smash fries! Fries with rosemary and olive oil... Enough said! The burgers are very good and they have tons of options to choose from. They also have options for picky kids like my daughter. They have hotdogs and grilled cheese, and \"normal\" fries for kids who haven't realized what yummy food is. Northern is back in classes so they may have a crowd but the service is usually fast."}
{"text":"UNLV is a virtual Mecca for cheap prices, good quality, and diversity in cuisine. Every time someone brought up burger joints, Smash was a destination worth mentioning. It was never the first on the list, but as I continue to cross out places I have tried, it was time to give them a taste.

When I entered, the cashier greeted me and asked if I had been there before. Usually when you reply no, the other person would explain, but he just asked for my order. That was not a big deal because I am usually set before I step anywhere near the register. The customer service was good overall, because when I did not order a drink, the cashier offered me a cup for water.

I had a job interview today, so I opted for the avocado club smash chicken sandwich because it did not have anything that would leave a lingering smell. If it was any other day, I probably would have gone for a burger with the works. The chicken breast was cut in two to cook faster, I liked this style because it allowed the meat to stay moist and juicy. Often the breast dries out and become overcooked if left whole. On top of that, they add four crisp strips of bacon, four slices of avocado, ranch, mayo, lettuce and tomato on a whole wheat bun. The sandwich is delicious, but pricey for the university area. At $7.99, you can go to In-N-Out and get a double double combo meal with a shake. At Smash, for the price of everything you would get next door, it would run you close to fifteen dollars. The food is good, but for that price I would probably go to Bachi Burger or Holsteins. I could pay a little more for a more unique meal."}
{"text":"First time we got screwed at Smashburger:( Gave them the Yelp check in screen when we ordered and the cashier forgot to add it, then tried to get another employee to fix it, but neither of them could figure it out so we paid full price.
Our burgers were disappointing too! They weren't as big and meaty as usual plus they were dry and the edges were a little crunchy (burnt). The fries were good like always thankfully but this visit really bummed me out. I usually rave about Smashburger. I will give them another chance, hopefully they don't let me down again."}
{"text":"Not as good as the W. Lake Mead location which we frequent quite often.
The restaurant itself is small. Service was a little slow, staff was not as friendly. The menu is different from non strip Smashburger's which is disappointing. The burger and and Smash fries were good. Fries were really oily but were still crisp and tasty. Even though I don't want to, I'll probably go back just because of it's convenience to home."}
{"text":"So sad...the service was awesome. But my burger...oh my poor burger was horrible. I've never had a Smashburger this bad before. It was very thin, dry, and salty. My fries were good. I'm hoping it was just a bad night for them. I will go there again hoping that it's better the second time around since it's so close to home. If not, I'll be making the ling drive to the Lake Mead location."}
{"text":"Good burgers but priced higher than other fast food joints like in and out. It's close to work so I go here when in the mood for a hamburger"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich is prettttyyy pretty good. Love the seasoned smash fries too! But. The best part about this location was our host Sydney. She is one of the most genuine and kind people ive ever met in my life. She is so nice i cant even really explain it. Thank you Sydney!!!! You made our day bright and shiny!!! Youre the best!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service, as well as good food. I had the triple double and it was fantastic. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"We came, we ate and left without being overly impressed. The food wasn't spectacular as we found our meal overly greasy without a lot of flavor and left us feeling not so great.  Definitely would not rate this place 5 stars as we have been to other great burger places who actually deserve that value."}
{"text":"Another new addition to Tempe and about a quarter mile or so from Mill ave and very close to ASU.  This is in the newer section of ASU on College and University and is very close to the dorms or a quick bite before a game.  The interior is a bit small and could easily crowd up fast and there is some seating outside.
Food is pretty good and definitely stands out from the normal fast food fare.  My burger was crispy on the outside, but still juicy in the middle, which is part of the Smashburger namesake and style that they are known for.  There is a decent amount of variety between the types of burgers or chicken sandwiches that can be ordered.  Fries are a bit on the limp/soggy side and could use some improvement, but the option for garlic and rosemary was pretty cool (needs more garlic, though).  The shakes are amazing and almost too rich for a place of this caliber and really made Smashburger stand out as a restaurant/dining option.  Haagen-dasz ice cream shake in vanilla, chocolate, strawberry or mixed up creates a very tasty side or dessert."}
{"text":"So today was the first time I had a smash burger.  I ordered a spicy jalapeno Baja burger with french fries and fried pickles, the burger was fresh all the fixings were fresh tomato, onions, Jalapenos and lettuce, it was delicious!  The fried pickles are lightly battered and deep-fried they're really good in the french fries are really thinly cut cook very crispy and they were delicious to the seasoning was not too salty.  I really enjoyed my visit today and I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Great tasting burger.  Glad to be the first person to write about it!  So glad we finally have a great burger place in SoMo!"}

{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  

Yes, the menu looks great!

But the utter greasiness of the food was just such a turn off.  The burger and the fries were swimming in oil.  My stomach hurt after eating here just from the sheer amount of oil.  

Don't get me wrong, I think love a juicy burger, Five Guys are my favorites, but this wasn't juicy it was just gross.  

I gave it two stars just because there are a lot of options."}
{"text":"I cant count the number of times I've gone to SB. Some of the times have been excellent and some have been \"fair\" and some have really p'd me off.
I went in to get a smash chicken and sweet potato fries to go. Tell my why i waited 30 mins for my \"to-go\" order. I had to go to the counter and ask the manager where my food was and that i had been waiting for 30 mins for TO GO, She went to the window and grabbed a bag under the heating lamps. Why ask my name when you dont call it when my food is ready? She wasn't apologetic i had to wait that long either! My fries werent that good after 30 mins.
Another time i got the chicken sandwich and ate almost all of it then realized it was pink inside! I was not too happy. lucky i didnt get sick! I have learned from that and i cut in my chicken whether its in the salad or my smash chicken! Dont bother to do the surveys if you have a legit complaint *my raw chicken* No one ever contacts you. Although you do get a free side during your next visit. Maybe do the survey but if you have a complaint don't expect someone to call and see what was wrong.
Also i dont like the menu change! You used to be able to add any cheese to your burger or chicken at no charge. Now they wanna charge for everything. :( Even if your burger is supposed to already have cheese on it. I do love this place thats why i keep coming back but i hope they dont get too greedy and end up like another run of the mill burger place."}
{"text":"I'd never been to Smashburger, but had heard good things, so when Yelp offered an event here that provided a free entree and sample of their new shake, I jumped on the opportunity.  I was not disappointed!  I ordered the Arizona burger (jalapeno peppers, guacamole, and a spicy mayo), and my friend ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger.  Both were delicious!  Definitely a good quality burger, and the fries were pretty good too!  The shake was really good as well.  The atmosphere was clean and bright, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  I'd definitely come here again when I get the urge for a good burger."}
{"text":"5 stars for a good burger, fries and milkshake.  Good food quality and the service was great.  Been here for lunch and dinner now.  And great prices.   Better than other fast food burger places."}
{"text":"The food is great, the staff is awesome, but the line drives me CRAZY!. They consistently have a line out the door, and they consistently only have one cashier working. This wait is exacerbated by the required survey sales pitch, and slogans. I am amazed at how it can take 5 minutes for one person to order a burger. You will be in line for 20 -30 min with 5 people in front of you. I am not exaggerating I have timed it. The funny thing is they take all this extra time to tell you about the survey, so you submit one and nothing changes. I have an idea save some time, and drop the survey pitch because clearly you don't read them."}
{"text":"The burgers aren't bad, they are in fact quite tasty. The part of the meal I want to complain about is the side. The sweet potato smashfries were such a small portion it was ridiculous. The fries were also extremely greasy and limp. I don't know if it's the oil, the length they cook them for or what, but they are just heavy and inedible. I had the same experience at the smashburger by my work, so I think it's the same at all of them now. For a much cheaper meal I will be going across the street for a much tastier side of fries with my IN-N-OUT Burger meal."}
{"text":"I ventured here today for lunch since my colleagues at work have been raving about it. 

They evidently don't offer the option of calling in an order for takeout, which disturbed me a little. The girl on the phone stated they only take orders in person. 

I had the Classic Smashburger and sweet potato fries. The burger itself was very tasty, juicy and flavorful. The crisp pickles were great along with the leaf lettuce. I like the sauce as well, sort of similar to In-n-out's secret sauce. My only complaint was that by the time I got it back to my office to eat it, the bun had soaked up so much juice it left it mushy. The fries were casualties as well, limp greasy potatoes. The rosemary and garlic seemed to overpower the sweet potato fries, but it may have been more because of the lack of crispiness that left a bad taste in my mouth. 

I vow to eat inside the restaurant next time, because this place certainly has potential!"}
{"text":"All of you people commenting on the price are complete morons. You do realize you're in Vegas, at Caesar's palace right? The burger was really good, the smash fries were excellent, and I got full for $13. I would eat here again. Don't come to Vegas if you're going to bitch about high prices."}
{"text":"Slow and had to go get the manager to expedite our order that was sitting in the window \"to go\" even they gave me a table number sign. Lost is all can say. I guess blame it on the rain."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with my coworkers, and everybody loved what they got!.. The service was very fast. Even when the line was large when we arrive (there were people outside the restaurant in the line) we could have lunch and go back to the office in less than an hour. 

I ordered the classic burger with mushrooms. And it was just great!!.. There is nothing I would change. The meat was very tasty, and everything was delicious! 

As I am new in the area and I don't know so many restaurants here. I cannot say is the best around. But my coworkers normally go out every Friday for lunch. And they all agreed that those are the best burgers in the area.

The onion rings were delicious too. And the prices are good too!!  This is a place where I definitely want to go back!!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is better. Frozen shoe string fries, smashed flat, dry burger (smashing the burger DOES NOT make it juicy, it makes the burger dry!!) the sweet tea is NOT sweet, or just hire someone from the south to show you how that is done. One star is being generous"}
{"text":"Excellent!!

I had to do a layover on my way to Georgia and stayed at a friend's house.  I asked their daughter where is good to eat and she brought me here.
I was amazed. Californians love In-N-Out but I'm not a die-hard fan of them. I can take or leave them. Smashburger by far surpasses In-n-Out in my book. (sorry fanatics)
The burger was juicy and big. The seasoning was unique. The fries were yummy. I had a chocolate shake and it was nice and thick.

Recommend and will visit next time in Vegas for sure."}
{"text":"Not the best burger quality its on the small size and expensive i had a bacon  chese burger fries and a drink total was 20$  your better off going to in n out"}
{"text":"3 stars for friendly staff. 

Ordered a smash burger w no cheese. Important BC I'm lactose intolerant ... I ate it and half way through realized  tasted funny ... Figured it was the smash sauce (first time using it) about 1/4 way left of the burger I realized the taste was cheese as I stated to get nausea ... 

Def asked for no cheese... Got cheese. Hence 3 stars"}
{"text":"Nice menu choices, has a little of everything beef, veggie and chicken! Good selection of fries, friend pickle or onions, even uses haagen dazs ice cream fortheir shakes/ malts. 

Fresh good taste."}
{"text":"looove this place. when you go in and eat the service is way fast like its ridiculous how fast it is. hopefully it doesnt shut down cause its the only closest one to me."}
{"text":"What can I say? I first heard about it on Facebook. So when I saw it in Denver I had to try it. I've loved everything I've tried with the exception of their fried pickles. Too salty. But I have been a fan ever since and I tell everyone who isn't tired of hearing me yet how great their burgers are. I even like the chicken sandwiches. I've been to three different locations and the service has always been so top notch they must treat their employees really well."}
{"text":"Serving up raw burgers since 2015! This place is horrible and wasn't able to simply cook a burger without raw meat throughout the center even after sending it back."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER HANDS DOWN!!!!!! Quality ingredients, great prices! The fries are out fo this world, and the onion straws are a great addition. The egg bun they use is so good. You get alot of burger for your buck! Only thing I did not like was that everything had to be bought separately, no combos, but that is minor."}
{"text":"Service was great! The cashier saw me coming towards the door with my stroller and she opened the door for me and my other son. I thought that was really nice of her. We ordered 2 burgers, fries, veggie frites and a kids meal. All came to $25 and change. Food tasted great and came out to is really quick. I like this set up rather than the older smashburgers (in summerlin and nw) because seating is more spaced out and it seems roomier. We will def be back to enjoy the freshly made food! And thank you for your awesome service!"}
{"text":"First visit. Enjoyed our burgers but thought they were a bit small. We will know to add a patty for myself next time. Smash fries were crispy and good. Fresh ingredients taste good."}
{"text":"Always delicious and expertly crafted burgers. The staff is always friendly and helpful. In my opinion, Smashburger is one of the best chain restaurants to indulge in a hamburger or cheeseburger. The classic smash is my favorite. The prices are quite reasonable and they are always busy."}
{"text":"Burger is TINY and expensive even without a drink and fries."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice.  The first time was when it first opened.  I remember them being average with their hamburgers and sweet potato fries.  I got takeout the last time, and it was awful.  The burger was greasy and the sweet potato fries were barely cooked.  Maybe it was a bad day for them, but either way, I am not sure I will be headed back there any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this fast casual burger spot. It's probably one of my favorite that casual burger restaurants. They have a good variety of unique burgers. They do chicken as well on all of their burgers. I've tried several different burgers in their menu and never been disappointed. Most recently I got the mushroom burger and it was pretty good. It probably wasn't my favorite burger of theirs, but it was good nonetheless. My favorite thing if theirs is the rosemary olive oil fries. I wish the had more variety/unique milkshake flavors. 

Overall this is a solid burger joint that I'll come to again for a good, cheap burger."}
{"text":"I went in mid-afternoon to place an order and the order took 20 MINUTES to come.  I found out they stopped the timber on the screen to improve their metrics, forgot to put cheese on my burger and the fries were COLD .... ALL after 20 minutes.  I spoke to the district manager director who told me the district manager changed for that store from a couple weeks ago and you get the run around.  I would stay away from this place as much as possible!!"}
{"text":"Great juicy burgers done your way and some ways you never thought of before! Truffle mayo, mushrooms, Swiss, add a fried egg.  Thick shakes. Rosemary seasoned fries. So yummy. Go check em out!!"}
{"text":"Right across the street from my pad and when you need a good cure for a hangover or just a good quality burger this is the place.  Onion straws are amazing, sweet potato fries, to die for.  Burgers are cooked just right and they are quick if you need it on the go.  Service was great and the staff was very helpful.  Great place to go grab a quality burger."}
{"text":"Food can taste amazing IF it wasn't poured with salt. The burgers were super salty I was able to see the salt on top of the meat. The onion Rings were also super salty. I couldn't eat half of it. By the time I took a sip of my soda I felt that even THAT was salty. The salty burger and onion rings messed up my taste buds. Second time this happens. Will not be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Went to the VIP Grand Opening last night for the new Smashburger.  This one is awesome.  Not only is the location close to CenPho but it fills in a space that is in need of decent food.  

The new Smashburger is on the side of the Best Buy next to the Cold Stone.  They have some outdoor seating and big windows so that you can see in and see what is going on.  

The place is nicely laid out and there are a decent number of tables (more than the Tempe location).  The staff is friendly and helpful.

As far as the food goes - well, it is Smashburger.  You can expect to get yourself a salty burger, some slightly greasy fries, and a yummy HaagenDaz shake.  If those are up your alley, then you will love this place.  In my opinion, they make the best fast food burger around.

If you haven't gotten out to the Tempe location or the new Avondale one yet, go hit this one up.  Im sure it will be packed come lunch time."}
{"text":"Well I just had to make a special trip out to the Valley's first Smashburger.  I love a good burger and while nothing really competes with the Fez Burger, this place will be making a run for the top spot.

Walking in, this place is pretty nice.  The color scheme is a bit of a nod to the traditional diner but without all of the red leather bar stools and diamondplate.  That's a good thing.  The people are very friendly and helpful (plus there were plenty on staff).  The menu is available outside (which I like because it helps make the line go a bit quicker) and they have a build-your-own card for your personalized burger creations.  In other words, they do everything that the Two Hippes Breakfast Joint doesn't.  Pretty sweet.

The food took 3-5minutes or so to come out.  We ordered ours To-Go but ended up eating outside.  It comes in a nicely packaged, especially if you were going to a picnic or something like that.  Nice presentation for to-go.

I ordered the Arizona Smashburger which was pretty much what you would expect it to be (no, not dusty).  Semi-ironically, this burger is called the Baja Burger elsewhere but the premise is the same - guacamole, peperjack, chipotle mayo, jalapenos on a chipotle bun.  Gotta say, this was actually on the slightly spicy side.  A nice change of pace from places that claim to have spicy food but never do.  

The burger part of this meal was the best part.  Not only was it cooked to a perfect medium (you might want to specify if you like it more done) but it was a big juicy patty.  You could tell it had been a ball of meat that had literally been smashed into its current form.  Just like I make at home.  The burger was a bit on the salty side around the edges.  Not sure what that was about but I LIKED IT!  Really it was a damn tasty burger.

Finally, we also ordered some \"veggie fries\" which I sort of expected to be like veggie crisps.  They were just fried veggies.  Carrots and asparagus cut into little sticks with some salt.  It was good & came with some ranch dressing.  Simply not what I expected.

The final big plus about this place is its location.  Very happy to see a new place by a LRT stop.  You can never have too many restaurants by the LRT and having this one so close to the Vet/College stop will be great for football lovers, ASU students, and LRT riders like myself.  Well done Smashburger.  Bring on the chains."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food! LOVE the turkey burger and gluten free bun! I enjoy the craft your own because I can dress that baby up any way I want!"}
{"text":"Guuuuyyyyssss my boyfriend took me here for the first time and he couldn't believe how quick I ate the burger. It was that good! I recommend this place for burgers."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Prices aren't great but they are do able."}
{"text":"Smashburger at Norterra, while it wouldn't be my first pic but co-worker loves the place. Came right at lunch rush, so mildly dirty, especially the drink area. 

Food; The burger is satisfying I really come for the sweet potato smash fries, which are always tasty. 

Service; I will say the service is always friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try out Smashburger as it kept being compared to In-N-Out. Well, for all those that have tried In-N-Out this place isn't even in the ballpark. Burger was incorrect, took forever to get a new one, then it came out super greasy and just ok. Fries were bland. I'd much rather drive to Freddy's. Also, the layout was terrible - they have the drink station right up against tables so there is a line to get anything."}
{"text":"Good vibe clean space. They messed up one of our burger orders but replaced instantly no questions asked and provided free coupons for sides on next visit. Smart casual quick priced right. We will be back."}
{"text":"As far as high end fast food burgers go, this is by far my favorite stop.  Fresh ingredients, quick service and same taste in every store, this place has it all.  I tried the Sin City burger since they don't have it in Dallas and it was amazing.  Make sure to always order the smash fries or sweet potato smash fries."}
{"text":"Gross! I love a good burger but mine had so much grease there was a puddle in the basket. Totally over-rated and not worth the calories."}
{"text":"Not worth the money!

The service is pretty good, but it doesn't make up for the sub par food at outrageous prices. 

We ordered an Arizona Burger, Chicken Sandwich, Smash Fries and Sweet Potato Fries. The burger was small (even though it was \"almost a 1/2 pound patty) and the toppings were falling out, and there was barely any guacamole on it. The chicken sandwich looked like something a two year old threw together. The Smash Fries were just okay - nothing special at all.

The total for two sandwiches and fries was over $20! I could get more quality food at so many other places for a lot less. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"You can taste the freshness of the meat. 
It was my fist time at smash burger but it won't be the last. I got the French onion burger. The only thing I didn't like much was that the bread was cold."}
{"text":"My favorite here is the Arizona burger, that with some frensh fries and a vanilla shake just hits the spot. The staff is always very professional and energetic. Fast services as well. The cheese burger is also a classic and a good choice."}
{"text":"I was in line for over 25 minutes. So many people and only one person taking orders?? Everyone seems to just be meandering around. Tables not being cleared. Doesn't seem like enough people are working."}
{"text":"So I just have to say that this location has really picked up their game!! I have avoided this location for quite some time after being very disappointed with their food and service.. after trying this place again yesterday I was very impressed! The place seemed very clean and all the staff that I interacted with were very professional and accommodating! The food was the best I've had at any Smashburger in a long time.. I was pleased that they got my order right the first time and they checked back on me a couple of times during my meal."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back anytime soon..horrible customer service..fries were so drenched in oil they were soggy and asked for new ones 3 different times..I was completely done with my meal and had to ask again and FINALLY they gave them to me so soggy and nasty..I didn't eat one. This place needs serious help!! Go to in and out instead!"}
{"text":"Thanks for taking care of the issue with the troubled employee. I appreciate the corporate office for investigating the employee that was so disrespectful on their cameras and took action to ensure it would never happen again. Guess my issues with her only scraped the surface.  Good riddance!"}
{"text":"pros: love the burgers, food and quality you get. able to customize your order literally. I got the Baja smashburger with haystack onions. no complaints here.

coins : dirty tables when I sat down and moved, and no student discount but near UNLV ?? lady at register says \"its Vegas for ya\""}
{"text":"You'd expect high prices and mediocre food inside a casino food court. But this place is a little ridiculous. We were looking for breakfast and didn't know this Earl of Sandwich doesn't open until 11am. We were hungry so decided to try Smashburger. We had a breakfast sandwich for $7 and a breakfast burger for $9. Both were average. The kids wanted a parfait -- $7. We also ordered two Gatorades -- $5.50 each. Lastly we got two coffees -- $4.50 each. After taxes, breakfast was almost $50. It doesn't help they only have a few items on the menu with prices listed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My bestie and I came here prior to christmas shopping at Tempe marketplace.  She ordered the avocado club smash and I ordered the kids smash with fries.  Tasty burgers and among some of the best crispy fries. Next time I am ordering a rootbeer float to share.  The meat used for the burgers was fresh and yummy. Perfecto!"}
{"text":"Treated myself out for lunch last Friday and decided on smashburger since I was craving comfort food. I enjoyed my small smash burger and fries. It was super fresh and not overly salty.   
This location was busy and the soda foundations and tables were still clean. Return factor is high."}
{"text":"So happy to have a Smash Burger near my house.

Came in last weekend for lunch to find a little bit of a line. Not unusual for a Smashburger.

I went with my usual baja burger and haystack onions and gave the Butterfinger shake a try.

The staff were great, the place was clean, and the food came out in quick fashion for the number of people there.

A solid experience as usual."}
{"text":"Weirdness, Incompetence, and Unsafe Food Practices...  I walked into the store after a 4 year hiatus and thought I would get a Black Bean Burger for an early dinner and a change of pace. The girl behind the cash register looked at me with a scowl and said to the male worker standing beside her I cant serve him while making some type of gang sign with her two hands as she was stating that to him. He looked at her and said I'll serve him and he did, I was puzzled by what her problem was since I've never seen her before or spoke to her before. I placed my order of a Black Bean Burger with Blue Cheese, Chipotle Sauce and Dill Pickles and an order of Smash Fries, paid, then got my cup for my drink, filled it, sat down and waited. About 15 minutes later the waiter came and got my number 50 placard and went to get my order. He brought back a regular Beef Burger with everything else and I asked him then, is this a Black Bean Burger? He looked at it and said sorry I should of looked at the ticket, I said that's cool and waited again as he went to fix the order. He brought back the correct burger. I bit into it and noticed that it was barely lukewarm and not hot at all, I thought to myself was this going to be safe to eat and took the chance. I ate the lukewarm burger and the fries, finished my drink and left. About four hours later I got severe abdominal pain and didn't feel well, I went to bed, and then woke up the following morning with a sore throat and headache on Easter Sunday. I went to the emergency room doctor, she asked me if I've been exposed to strep throat recently, not that I know of but I ate some bad food yesterday, she diagnosed me with pharyngitis and gave me a Z-pac of antibiotics to take for the next five days. So needless to say I won't be coming back to this or any other Smashburger from now on. I'll do the standard In N Out that's right across the street, always quality and always satisfied or travel another couple blocks and hit up a Tommy Burger for my monthly splurge.

Just a heads up Smashburger; If you leave food out and it cools, or barely heat it, it will collect bacteria and it WILL get a customer sick. I'm lucky I'm a veteran and I can go to the Veterans (VA) Hospital. It costs me very little, just $8 for the prescription and $35 for the Emergency Ward. For a Non-Veteran doing that would amount to a major expense in this day and age....tighten up your food handling practices or lose more customers.....and educate your female counter staff, the one I came in contact with needs a check-up from the neck up."}
{"text":"Five stars always given when we have no complaints! For our first visit we each had different burgers which were as they claim, tasty & juicy! The sweet potato fries were good and crispy as were the shoestring onions, and we both had their gourmet HD shakes which were delicious. Food presentation is nice and simple. The staff was friendly and the service fast and accurate. The place is new and modern. It's a little pricey ($28 for 2 people) but worth the cost for better quality overall. We hope this Metrocenter location survives a long time."}
{"text":"If for any reason hell freezes over and it snows in Scottsdale and you need to salt the roads, just throw these burger patties on the street and it will clear the roads up because these patties are the saltiest things on earth after my ex-gf. Staff was nice and the girl working the front was pretty but not worth the stroke I'm going to have from all this salt. Should be renamed Salt Burger since the two ingredients are burger and salt."}
{"text":"So I finally made the trip to Smashburger and WOW this place rocks.  I got a custom built burger with Chipotle bun, apple wood bacon, chipotle mayo, jalapenos, habenero cheese, and a 1/2 burger.  I also got the smash fries after reading all the reviews about how amazing they were.  Which yes they were.  : )  I was in heaven eating this burger it was dripping out everywhere just like a good burger should.  

This is one of my new favorite burger shops in the valley so if you haven't been make the trip it's worth it."}
{"text":"At first I was the typical In N Out fan complaining that this place was going to be over priced and mediocre- aka, not as good as In N Out. I was COMPLETELY wrong about that. This is place has hands down the best black bean burger I have ever eaten- it's actually slightly addictive. I go with the build your own black bean burger and love it. The sides you can get are excellent too, they have a very decent selection from four kinds of fries to veggies and fried pickles. The prices are about the same as In N Out depending on what you get."}
{"text":"The office did a lunch run here last week and I just was not impressed. I ordered the smash fries with a cheese burger with pickles. I bet if it were hot and fresh, it would have been way better. The fries had a frozen flavor to them and the burger was dry and salty. I'll try dining in next time. See if that makes it better."}
{"text":"-Wannabe In-n-Out- My burger was dry, and not very tasty. I can't figure out why this place was so packed. The next time I feel like dropping 8 bones on a burger, I will go to Delux. MMmmmm..Delux."}
{"text":"Food was good the dust busters and vacuum  in the dining area  gross! I would think this would not be the norm cause if it is its discussing!"}
{"text":"Mom kept saying in and out is better, and how they try to copy their fries. Lmao. Ohhhh mommmm

I loveeee my black bean burger.   yummm. With our without the bun is still delicious. 
Ugh, now debating if we should walk next door to get cold stone. Lolz"}
{"text":"Black bean burger with Avacado was to die for. The fries were crispy. Dip it with ketchup, ranch, pepper and hot sauce. Sighhhhh. Amazing. That's my concoction. I absolutely finished my burger, and I usually eat half. Gaspp. *fat girl problems*"}
{"text":"I had a really good burger today.  Mushroom and swiss, juicy burger, lots of mushrooms, good bun!  Yep, good burger.  The fries were ok - a little too salty for me.  My daughter's chicken strips/fries were the typical kid's meal fare.  The whole place wasn't as clean as I'd like considering they weren't busy and they had lots of staff.  But I will go back for a burger."}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy!  This is my favorite for the best burger, grilled mushroom & swiss chicken, or a healthy salad.  Everything here is GREAT!"}
{"text":"I love smash burger and had meals at many locations and the food is always great. Saturday night was the first time I was ordering take out.  The girl up front took my order then I sat down at a table to wait. This was at 8:30 at night so it wasn't busy at all. I waited and waited. Finally 30 minutes later I went up and asked how much longer our order would be. The girl seemed surprised when she saw me. Asked my name. Oh there was my order in the huge bag that had been sitting there for more than 10 minutes. I got the food home and it wasn't hot at all. Cold soggy fries. Very disappointed. That was $58 worth of soggy burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times and had enough.   Staff is extremely rude every time we go in.   One time we went in, were the only people in line and the MANAGER had her back to us while playing on her cell phone.   After about 2 minutes I asked if anyone worked there.   She turned around and told me \"I'm busy, but yes I know you're there.\"  She then made a milkshake for no one, and only then took our order.   Chicken fingers for my daughter looked like they were cooked twice, they were hard.   My burger was cold and I was served old fries.   Wrote a note to corporate and was told the issue will be dealt with - they sent vouchers for a complimentary meal on them.   Went back one more time to again receive cold fries and a burnt cheeseburger.   Will NEVER go back to this place again, nor would I recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is usually a delicious and good experience today on the other hand was horrible. Women's bathroom toilet overflowing, horrible cashier he didn't listen to anything I was ordering when I say a combo that means a side and a drink. Why did he ask me three times if i wanted a drink and a fry??? Managers standing around doing nothing, guy at the expo station complaining about the poor guy busting his ass in the kitchen! Calling him a idiot and saying he doesn't know how to do his job. Probably won't be back here I'm a business owner myself and I would never let my staff act in this way."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Smashburger fan, my frequented stores located at Norterra and Desert Ridge. This location SUCKS.

I went for lunch with someone who has never had Smashburger before. I wish I had been paying attention when he ordered because he ended up getting a pretty plain burger, no fixins. He said he assumed they came with lettuce, tomato, etc. and that the girl at the register did not ask what he wanted on it.

Second problem, the ice was being filled in the beverage dispenser and some genius employee unplugged the machine first and decided to not tell anyone, not even the girl filling the ice! Several customers asked staff what was up with the drinks, but nobody investigated the problem until I made sure someone understood, \"The beverage machine does not seem to be ON.\" Took a lot of head-scratching before Mr. Genius came out and said, \"Oh! I unplugged it! Haha...\". This whole fiasco led to about 20 customers needing drinks all at the same time.

THIRD and possibly the most inexcusable problem. My fries... were SWIMMING in oil. I was able to eat most of them, but there were quite a few that were inedible. I will post a picture. It was really gross. You can clearly see the oil slick on the fries, what's harder to see is the POOL underneath them, but it was definitely there. What kind of half-assed, lazy fry-cook allows this to happen? I really wanted to complain about this, but given that it was A. very busy and B. low-caliber employees I'd have to deal with, I figured it was just not worth the hassle. 

Avoid this location, especially if introducing someone new to Smashburger."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I'm not sure why there are so many mixed reviews... maybe what they ordered? I always get the regular size custom burger... blue cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato (and sometimes bacon). Simple and delicious. The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing. The only thing I didn't care for were the fried pickles... a bit too salty."}
{"text":"I finally tried Smashburger the other night. I got the original smash, but I am not a huge fan of the sauce. I'm a ketchup kind-of-girl, so good thing I got the sauce on the side. I will probably try a chicken sandwich next time, but I thought I'd go traditional for my first time. I caved in and also got the mint shake and um yes it was SO worth it! Delish!"}
{"text":"I love their food but the last time we ate-in, my wife ordered a salad and got a burger. Luckily we were eating in so they made that right. THIS time I ordered a spinach & goat cheese salad and a Harvest Cobb to go. I got all the way home and found I'd received TWO spinach & goat cheese salads! I should have looked before I left the store,especially since they screwed it up last time too!"}
{"text":"Juicy is the first word that comes to mind - perhaps the juiciest burger I've ever had.

I had the \"big\" version of the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger, and it was an exceptional burger. It wasn't my favorite burger of all time, but I'd say it's probably somewhere in the top 7-10. 

The egg bun is soft and doughy, and is satisfying to bite into. The beef patty, as previously mentioned, oozes with juicy goodness, and the bacon, fried onions, and BBQ sauce round out the flavors. 

In a way it reminds me of the fantastic BBQ burger at the Applepan in West Los Angeles, but somehow it doesn't quite replicate the magic. 

I tried both the chili cheese fries and the sweet potato smash fries and neither did it for me. The chili cheese fries felt sloppily thrown together, and the flavors didn't balance particularly well, and I felt that coating the sweet potato fries in rosemary and parmesan cheese gave them an almost mushroom-like flavor - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Will I come back? Definitely - I'm already craving  another one of their burgers while writing this. Perhaps I'll even try one of the smash chicken sandwiches next time."}
{"text":"I Love the truffle burger, true, but the friendly fast service about 1/2 hour before closing is what really keeps me coming back.  Tried the one on Eastern in Henderson & although friendly, they repeated my togo order  back right  3 times between 2 people and typed it in correct , but it was completely wrong when i gor home , no mas on that location!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is please check your food before leaving. I love smash burger and I am a regular to this location. I have to always check if they put bacon on the sin city burger because sometimes they forget. The past time was the worst. I ordered togo and when I got home I got a nasty surprise. The cook took off their glove and neglected to put it in the proper spot of the trash and left it in my wrapper. I did inform the manager and she was very polite about the situation and apologized. Just be aware that the kitchen staff is very forgetful."}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say this is one of the best airport burgers I've ever had. Fries were hot and crispy and the burger was very juicy. They'll customize the burger so don't be afraid to ask. 

This is a much better option than the McDonalds past security if you are craving a burger before you take off."}
{"text":"Oh boy....well, the burgers aren't bad but there are definitely better ones. The service is horrible. Today we were told to move from our seats because a table was reserved-yes, somehow people that came in after us and ordered after us \"reserved\" a table. Seriously? Since when does smashburger take reservations? They don't. Apparently they are friends with an employee and they made us move while we waited for our food. Anyway, I won't be back-this truly soured me."}
{"text":"Yes, a burger is a burger and a french fry is a french fry but when you are in a hurry and you are searching for something fast and delicious all at the same time smash burger just has something special that meets that criteria every time I go there. You feel like you are at a nicer place than something like a burger king and the quality of the burgers backs that claim. 

We ordered a blue cheese and truffle burger as well as the burger with an egg, bacon, and onion straws and man oh man they were both on point. Paired with the fries tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary you cannot go wrong. 

We ordered,  ate our food and got out within 25 minutes which was perfect for the schedule we happened to be on. This is definitely a go to now whenever we are in a hurry and want to grab an amazing burger for a fair price that is not in a drive thru under some yellow hue arches.."}
{"text":"Smashburger? More like Trashburger! $14 for a burger and fries and I leave feeling like I just ate a happy meal without the toy. Over recommended and over hyped. The only benefit was the free soft serve that I received after sitting on my throne later that night. 2 out of 5 stars bc I'm feeling generous."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and spent $30 on two combos and an extra side.  We put in our order online so we could be more precise and so everything would be printed on our receipt because this is a common problem.  Bf orders a sandwich with no tomato and no mayo.   I also ordered no mayo.  Upon picking up our order to take home, we realize something in the bag is missing, and then they question us when we tell them it is missing.  The guy was trying to read the receipt like it was written in giberish.  He gives us our missing item and we depart... get home to realize that bf's sandwich has tomato AND mayo on it.  He ended up throwing the sandwich in the trash, a good 10$ down the drain because they don't pay attention to detail... isn't that the entire part of the job?"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

So...I had not been to a Smashburger in years.  The last few times I did go to one, I left disappointed.  There are better burgers to be found, a lot of the time, for a lesser price, too!  I saw a commercial pop up though that was advertising their new \"Pub Triple Double\" burger and it looked/sounded right up my alley.  I headed down here yesterday to try it out.

Real quick, before I get into my review, one small gripe.....I downloaded their app and your \"welcome offer\" was a deal that had \"buy a side and a drink, get a free entree\".  I go to use the coupon and wanted the Pub Triple Double as my entree, but they told me I could not use it due to the burger already being at a discounted rate.  First of all, that doesn't make any sense.  The Pub Triple Double is only $4.00 on its own.  Their other burgers are $6.00 or more.  As a business, wouldn't you want to lose less money ($4.00 compared to over $6.00) and allow your customers to choose the lowest priced entree?  I didn't push the issue, and will save that coupon for a different time.  Anyways................  I went with a Pub Triple Double, a large fries and a glass of water.  My total was just over $7.00.  Here is how they were....................

Pub Triple Double-  First of all, this is what brought me in.  Two patties, 3 slices of American cheese, garlic grilled onions, Guldens mustard on a pretzel bun.  That's how I normally order my burgers (meat, cheese, onions and sometimes mustard), so I was really excited to try this one out.  The person came out and dropped off my tray of burger/fries and the first thing I noticed, was that it was a bit skimp.  Think of Wendy's Double Stack, but on a pretzel bun.  Not a 2 bite burger/slider, or anything like that, but I could have easily ate 2 of these things.  The flavors were fantastic though!  It was perfect with the 3 slices of cheese on it.  One of the slices didn't really melt all that well, but it was still tasty.  The onions were nice and soft, the mustard complimented the pretzel bun really well, and the beef was freshly cooked and nice and juicy. Guessing maybe 1/4 lb of meat on it?  Would have been better with 1/3lb. Pretty messy to eat, but worth it.  Just wish it was a bit larger.  For $4.00, it's a good deal.  If it was $6-7.00, I would pass.

Fries-  These were great!  Some of the better fries I have had from a fast food joint.  Incredibly hot, crispy and tasty.  Damn fine fries!  

Overall, I am glad I stopped in to try this particular burger.  Delicious, but small.  Their fries were great though, and their app/rewards program sounds like it should have some decent deals going forward.  Not racing to come back, but I'm sure I will sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"Fast food -- I know!!!  It looks like they changed their French Fries, which I like.  The burger, the cook was really heavy with the salt today, even my companion noticed way too much salt, and a little too much time on the flat top.  

I used to like it when they served the shakes in a glass when dining in--now moved to the paper cup--probably more cost effective!  Oh well.  Still like my hamburger from time to time.

NEED to cut back on the salt!!!"}
{"text":"Just went in for a shake and asked if the peanut butter was better as a shake or malt.  The guy making them behind the girl that was helping me said, \"they are all bad.  Hagan das is the worst ice cream.  He was totally serious...probably mad that he was sticking making several shakes.  Personally he should be fired."}
{"text":"What a great burger and fries...on the run through the airport!  This is a stop and enjoy burger!  
I'll be finding them in Phoenix on new regular routes for that constant burger craving.  
The fries were hot and fresh, so good...didn't need ketchup!  
Hard to believe this coming from a \"fast food\" place."}
{"text":"If I could write two reviews; one for the front counter and one for the kitchen I would. Since I am not able to here goes. The counter staff has always been super helpful and accommodating. Somewhere between ordering and the food being prepared is where the disconnect is. For example, tonight I ordered a classic grilled chicken smash, no mayo, no onions. My MIL ordered the crispy chicken buffalo blue cheese sandwich. My sandwich was not the classic smash and not only did they not take the mayo off but added more and added avocado to a burger that does not normally have avocado. My MIL did not have ANY blue cheese on her sandwich (which we paid extra for). Considering that blue cheese is in the name of the sandwich it is disappointing not to have received any. This is not the first time that our order has not been correct and honestly, I am becoming extremely frustrated. I am going to be forced to double check every order to ensure that we are receiving the food that we were promised. Please figure out a way to rectify the kitchen issues. We love your product just not the messed up end result and will be forced to go to another location. Or another burger restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the better burger places around. The only places that are better in my opinion are 5 guys and Red Robin. The staff is friendly and this place always has a ton of customers so you know they're doing something right. 

My personal fav. is the Arizona Smashburger and don't forget the Smash fries..."}
{"text":"So I have been wanting to try Smashburger for a while, I heard heard really good things about their fries.  So me a my boyfriend decided to give it a whirl for lunch the other week.  The menu looked and sound great, just when the food came out I was disappointed.  

Burger:  It is the thin flat, sonic style paddy.  Now I know why when we asked for medium they told us no.  I wash picturing more of the juicy thick burger cooked to order.

Fried:  There specialty is a olive oil and garlic fry.  They forgot to make mine the special way.  I mentioned something when my food came out.  You can tell they took my fries, dumped EVOO all over them and brought them out

Fried Pickles:  These were actually the  best, thin slices fried with a nice dipping sauce, I do recommend this

Milk Shake:  Okay it would have to be impossible to mess this up.  Haggen Daas ice cream....enough said

Long story short I see why people would like smashburger I just prefer a different kind of burger"}
{"text":"I go to this location numerous times a week. All employees are great, some remember me by name. Everyone is so friendly. I've eaten at other smash burger locations around Las Vegas and for some reason the burgers just aren't the same like they are at this location. Never have a problem with my order, always quick and made to how I like it every time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a weekday on my lunch break. I was impressed with the selection and options. I had the chicken sandwich with bbq sauce and grilled onions.  I sat out on their little patio, and the server brought it out pretty quickly. It was very good. In the future  I'd like to try the onion rings, regular fries sweet potato fries and a burger.  

It was good, and I like all the options and variety."}
{"text":"I had the classic burger with no cheese and no pickles. Regular sized which I believe is 4 ounces of beef. It was a very good hamburger. My dad and I went there and ordered our food to go. 

Unfortunately the people who were working there we're not really quick with our to go order and it got kind of cold by the time we got home. I noticed the bags just sitting there and they weren't calling my name. 

My dad also got a classic burger which he enjoyed and we ordered an avocado club burger for my mom which she said was very good. 

We were not very impressed with the fries or the onion rings. Onion strings actually. They were very soggy and cold. None of us cared for the dipping sauce. 

I would say the hamburgers were a solid four stars, but combined with the slowness of the to go order and how are bags of food just sat there without anyone calling our names,  I have to give them three stars. 

I would go back, but I would dine in to avoid cold french fries and cold onion strings."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 -#22/100

This is the third time we visited. Honestly the burgers were nothing special to me. My brother and my son enjoyed theirs though. My mom ordered the grilled chicken strips and they were good. This time around my son got the sin city burger and Spicy fries. He said the burger was good but the fries were too salty. I felt bad throwing away more than half of the fries as there are many who go hungry but I can't sacrifice my son's kidneys for the fries. 

Restroom is clean, my only problem with it, is they don't provide seat protectors. Parking is crazy, you're lucky if you find one even a quarter mile or so down, always give yourself time for parking, thus this 3 star review."}
{"text":"I'd give them 4 stars if they didn't get rid of the buffalo fries which was my go to always with them. I never get the burgers here I just prefer crispy chicken with avocado anything really and those are always pretty good. Prices are a little much but whatever no biggie. Foods pretty decent generally here. Milkshakes are great too. Maybe train your employees to not hover over customers though. Coming into a restaurant to order just to have the girl behind the counter with the large Princess Leia hipster buns and nose ring stare at my bf and ignore me when I'm ordering and then make her way over to the far west side of the establishment where we were eating to \"wipe down\" tables ( but only the ones right next to us ) while another young woman was already cleaning that area was a little unprofessional. Cool you find someone attractive and I found it amusing the first 2 minutes but it got a little annoying having a girl just standing there the entire time within earshot of our conversation while we're eating because she thinks someone is blatantly attractive. #calmdowngirl"}
{"text":"I noticed these places popping up around Las Vegas so after a morning of outlet shopping, I decided to give it try.  I went in around noon and it wasn't too crowded.  I ordered the classic smash with fries.  The cashier wasn't rude, but not too enthusiastic either.  After I sat down, my order was brought to me and the girl who delivered it was much more cheerful and told me to \"enjoy\".  
The burger was juicy and lots of flavor and the fries were standard French fries, but might taste different if I were visit Smashburger again."}
{"text":"So much better that 5 Dorks, I mean guys.  They have salads and great chicken selections!"}
{"text":"I really like this place for many reasons. One main is that unlike another delicious burger place, you can order chicken! I'm sure it's not as healthy as I wish it were but it makes me feel a little better about eating fast food. The fries are delicious and the smash sauce is something to write home about (thinner thousand island?) bomb. I'm always coming back and this particular location is clean and quick with service"}
{"text":"First time at a Smashburger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Close, but not better than In-N-Out. There were many ways to customize the burger but I just stuck with the original smashburger with smashfries. So good. The staff was super friendly. Very clean place and so busy--we were lucky a table opened up as soon as we finished ordering. TLooking forward to going back and trying something new! 

The only downside isn't really the restaurant's fault--the parking. It took a while to park...who puts Kneaders, Cafe Rio, Smashburger, Mod Pizza, Firehouse Subs, and Starbucks with so little parking? We did go on a Saturday night so that probably didn't help...but still...when you go, you will see how small the parking lot is. Definitely worth the wait for a spot though."}
{"text":"I have been awaiting this Smashburger's opening for one year...yes, a year!  It is a teeny sized building but I guess for a Smashburger it's enough..or NOT. It is in a busy neighborhood, Cotswold,  and we have been in need of a good burger joint for a LONG time. I have been there 6 times now, anytime from 2pm til they close. I find there is always a 'line' of folks awaiting their \"\"to go\" orders, sometimes with friends and there IS little room inside the S/B to wait. The area to do so, is directly in front of the pick-up counter and in direct line to the drink machine. Last night I counted 11 people packed along the 'take out bar' (the bar really serves no purpose), 4-5 employees trying to get the orders sorted, and walk-thru traffic trying to get to the drink machine and it was 8PM (not the busiest time). There is NO drive-thru, but maybe there ought to be if for no other reason than to pick-up the take out orders??
The burgers are decent. They are as good as what I might make at my home IF I had more than myself to cook for. I like the toppings assortment, and the buns available just to mix it up a bit. Some toppings you pay extra for, some not. They are PRICEY even for today's prices in meats etc....$10.40 for a burger and small fries is just HIGH. I got a regular size Smashburger and an order of fries (I got the regular ones).  They skimped on the fries and they were not hot, but I didn't know that and will check next time before I leave. I live 1 mile away and like to knosh on the fries as a walk home. I am not fond of the 'smash sauce', and will not have that on my burger in the future. I am a weightloss surgery patient and they allowed me to order off the kids meal menu like most of the other Charlotte restaurants do, which is one of the MAIN reasons I go to any restaurant  these days.
I can't really offer any information on any of the other food choices as MY main comings & goings here will be for the burgers. It was worth the wait, for me. I like knowing that my $6+ burger is cooked to order and has not been precooked or sitting under a heat lamp! They have me for a while."}
{"text":"I waited for this Cotswold Smashburger a long time. It's nice knowing I can stop in, so close to home, and get a fresh-cooked burger made like I choose. It's especially needed here in the Cotswold n'hood. The burgers are nothing all that 'WOW' and I think they're quite high dollar ($7) for a burger. Fries of any kind are extra $ and the very skinny fries. I DO like their Smashfries that are tossed in rosemary/garlic/oliveoil. They have lots of other foods and ice cream shakes, too! I'm sorta limited to what I can eat, as I'm a gastric bypass survivor. They DO allow me to eat off the KidsMenu, as do so many other great CLT restaurants, which I am thankful for. Even a kids meal burger is 2 meal for me. I'm going to adventure the menu more soon! Of note is they have one of those 100+ kinds soda machines and while I am not a soda drinker, the machine also has flavored waters and a Segrams Lemon-Lime in it!
The Smashie workers are all polite & mostly college-aged...and appear happy at work. 
The Take-out Bar/waiting section could/should be redone...as it's in a strange place and when the place is busy you are always in someones way. Parking is there behind the place, BUT if you visit know the in/out are ONE...and difficult to get out of behind th HTeeter. Park on the Randloph Rd side of HT for better escape once done with your Smashburger!"}
{"text":"My favorite Smashburger location!  I LOVE their black bean burgers and their sweet potato fries with extra chipotle dipping sauce.  So delicious.  Also, be sure to sign up for their email.  I'm always receiving free deals from them."}
{"text":"My friend was working as an associate professor for a while at ASU so we would meet for lunch in the area often and Smashburger became a favorite.  The black bean burgers and sweet potato fries are THE BEST!!!"}
{"text":"I was SOOOO hoping for a better experience! After being wowed at the CMYE at the new location in Henderson, I jumped for joy when Smashburger came up on Groupon. Only having 30 days to use the Groupon, we dropped in when we were sort of in their neck of the woods since this is a bit out of the way for me.

Located near the University, next door to In and Out and across the street from Cafe Rio, it is surrounded by all of my favorites. The restaurant was clean and there were a few but not many people eating. We had no problem using the Groupon and knew right what we wanted: The Vegas Burger, The Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger, Fried Pickles, a Blue Moon and a Fat Tire.

The beer was brought to our table and we were offered frosty mugs - why yes of course! I love that! The food came out shortly after. It tasted much like I remembered with 2 distinct differences. 1) the Vegas Burger had PILES of sauteed onions! UGH... I like a little bit of onion, but this had seriously about 1/4 cup of them piled on and melted into the cheese... way too much! 2) both burgers were extremely greasy! That was one thing we noted during the CMYE, the burgers were juicy but not greasy. In fact, the owner had touted that they taught the cooks to sear in the juices so it wouldn't be greasy. Also, they toast the bun to keep the bun from getting soggy... well, that was not our experience. I enjoyed the fried pickles however.

The food was good, don't get me wrong, I'll return to Smashburger again... it just wasn't the experience we'd had at the other location, it truly was a let down."}
{"text":"Just want to qualify that I'm the type that rarely complains about food service, but my experience just kind of sucked, so I have to share..  The service was slow and terrible.  After sitting for 15 min, I come to find out that my order was one burger short - my daughter's burger was missing.  (Thinking back, I realize that the cashier had failed to repeat my order back to me which I felt I had clearly stated.  Isn't this food service 101?). No concessions of any kind were offered other than a dull apology - not even an offer to expedite an update to the order for the missing burger.  At that point, I was so frustrated I just asked for a refund which also took quite a long time to process.  Furthermore, it appeared that another patron one booth over was experiencing a similar problem.  Bad news..  It seems like the staff are either new, undertrained and/or suffering from extended New Year's hangovers - they exhibited a general lack of concern for providing a good service experience and little sense of urgency in terms of valuing the customer's time.  Managament, please train your crew better!  I took my business across the street to In-N-Out and don't plan on returning to your establishment. (They processed 10 cars through their drive-thru, in the same amount of time it took your crew to serve a couple of in-store customers.)"}
{"text":"Found a BOGO deal and I wouldn't come roaring back here based on what we ordered.  What we had was OK but OK just doesn't cut it in a town full of great burger choices. 

Got the Spicy Baja which was described on the menu as with \"pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and fresh jalapeños on a spicy chipotle bun.\"  Not spicy enough for me.  People who order this want to burn and it fails to do that.  The patty was big and it looked like a great burger but it was overdone to my liking.

I liked my wife's Sin City burger much better.  We actually ended up switching halfway through.  That burger was stacked with \"fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun.\" I ALWAYS want eggs on my burger.  The flavor was much better than the Spicy Baja and if I would order this if I were to do Smashburger again.  

What's with the metal tray things they serve the burgers on?  A plate would've been better.  I found them awkward.  Stuff will fall off your burger and it would just be easier to scoop off something without holes."}
{"text":"No, no, no!!

My avocado on my burger was rotten. They didn't even bother trying to hide it under the other toppings. Rotten. 

*shakes my head* 

It continues. The burger was dry, not as ordered, etc. I tried this location twice before saying no more as I've been to other Smashburgers that we're enjoyable."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option to give zero stars. Over the summer, I ate here and got food poisoning. I was told their insurance person would reach out to me and they haven't. I haven't stepped foot in here since, but a few weeks ago a coworker ordered food to go from smash and after 2 hours she spent the rest of her shift in the bathroom throwing up. My experience resulted in a hospital trip & colitis. Not sure if the cooks here just don't care or aren't sanitary but I would not recommend if you care about your body."}
{"text":"Dont ever order online. They f up our order big time. Nasty burger too. If i had a choice, i will select NO STAR!"}
{"text":"Now that Munch at Caesars closed, the Sin City Burger at Smash Burger is my favorite burger on the planet and I eat a lot of them (it was the blue cheese bacon burger at Munch until it closed). 

Service is absolutely fantastic. They never screw up an order. They have fresh ice tea. Only thing it is missing is a drive through window."}
{"text":"I had high expectations given the hype around the opening of Smash Burger, unfortunately it just didn't live up to the hype. I had the mushroom swiss burger and the smash fries on my visit. The burger was under seasoned and just perfectly average. The fries were completely soaked in oil making them greasy and heavy. The portion of fries was absurdly small for the price and overall I felt the price I paid was not worth the meal I received. I hope things improve and one day I can have a meal here that matches the hype, until then there are better burgers to be had at a better value."}
{"text":"Love Smash burger. Great food great service awesome. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwich with spinach,cucumbers,onions and goat cheese served on gluten free bun. Thanks for offering that option to those of us who can't eat wheat and want bread   The places that offer gluten free buns are few.  Counter help was incredibly polite and sweet.  It's nice to know that some people still are being taught manners.  My hope for humanity was unsmashed by visiting this place.  It's my new burger joint!!!!"}
{"text":"Smashburger is a solid choice for a consistently good meal. Last week while visiting Phoenix my group stopped here for a late dinner after shooting at nearby Rio Salado. I picked the mushroom burger with fries and it was all good. Self serve drinks make it easy not to go thirsty. 

For a chain, Smashburger serves solidly good food."}
{"text":"I have to say I went back last weekend now that the place should have their kinks worked out. I was pleasantly surprised with the much better service which I thought was the real short coming on my first visit. The staff was considerably more courteous and efficient than they had been and even the food tasted better. 

I have gone from thinking this place is okay to making it my go to burger. The fries are Gandalf the White to McDonalds Sarumon the White (for anyone who wasn't a perennial loser in high school that means while the fries are similar style Smashburgers are way better) much less expensive and less crowded than Burgatory, cheaper than Five Guys I will be frequenting Smashburger as my brother also loves this place. If you haven't yet I urge you to give them a try and if you came to the opening week I urge you to try it again."}
{"text":"Burgers and shakes are good. The fries suck. I just can't stand the small shoestring fries."}
{"text":"Delicious! No complaints other than when ordering I feel rushed everytime I eat there, just give me a minute people!! Love the new franks hot sauce burger! And can't go wrong with the smash fries!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, I don't like it. First of all googling the address and then actually trying to find where in desert ridge this place is at was hard enough. All the workers looked like they should still be in high school. And the food didn't taste as good as other locations, very disappointing. I will stick with going to the happy valley location next time."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of other Smashburger locations in Las Vegas and Overland Park KS, and this was the worst Smashburger experience.  We came in on Saturday at 1:45 pm and there were about 12 to 14 people in front of us.  After about 5 minutes half the people in front of us left.  In total there were probably 12-15 people that we saw walking out because of the wait, including after we sat down and ate.  We finally got to order after about 14-15 minutes waiting, there were only 3 people that we saw working, the person taking the order, the person cooking the food and maybe a manager handing it the food.  The three didn't seem very happy, especially the older lady taking the orders and taking out the food (leaving the register with no one for 5-7 minutes at a time.  It would have went a long way for them to acknowledge that they're short on people today and say sorry about the wait.  Not even a thank you after we placed our order.  Though this attitude seem to be par at some Chinese restaurants I've been to.  I don't expect this at an American restaurant.

After ordering, our food came out within 7-8 minutes, much quicker than expected considering how long it took to order.  We ordered 2 kids smash burgers with sweet potato fries (an extra $.50 upgrade--it only costs $.20 to upgrade from regular fries to sweet potato fries for the regular side, but costs $0.50 for a kids meal upgrade :(), an Oreo shake, an avocado club grilled chicken and a triple double.  We used a coupon for a free burger.  Even with the coupon the total was over $26.

The kids burgers were small, as expected.  It has been a 2-3 years since I've been to a Smashburger, but the triple double burger seemed small.  The only difference between my kids' burgers was another patty and lettuce tomatoes and pickles.  My main problem with the Triple Double was that it was soaking in grease.  When I lifted the burger from the paper, there was lots of grease on the paper.  When I put the burger down and looked at my fingers, it was covered in grease.  If I wanted to eat a grease burger, I would go to one of its competitors instead.  My wife said the avocado club grilled chicken was greasy, but not as bad.  My kids said that their burgers were fine and not greasy like my burger.

Like most of the others, we just left everything on our table, the wire trays, drink cups, napkins, etc. because the only trash can near the kitchen door we saw was completely filled with trash and trays.  There were no other trash cans that we saw.  We had to clean our tables ourselves so we could sit at a table.

Maybe we should have left like the people we saw leaving before and after ordering, but we didn't--this is what we get for staying.  If the 3 people working there weren't happy, then I don't expect that anyone there would be happy as well, including the customers.  I don't recall 1 smile from any of the workers the whole time we were there, in fact I don't think there were any smiles from customers either.  I hope this experience at this location is an exception."}
{"text":"I had a meeting in this area and I hadn't eaten all day, so I went here to taste this new joint.  What a huge disappointment after being told these were the best burgers ever.

Everything I had was so utterly salty and cooked bad, that eating at McDonalds would have been much better than eating here.  

Where do I start?  Fries, were the type of fries that might have been sitting out the day before.  They were all petrified, and extremely salty.  The kind of fries where every single one tasted like a bad potato chip.  They were supposed to have sea salt on them, which would have made the saltiness a little bearable, but there was no trace of sea salt on these.  

Haystack Onion strings were seasoned so badly I had to throw them out.  They had this funky taste that made me think they were seasoned with ground up chicken bullion cubes.  I kid you not.  They were just so over the top they were inedible.

The burger probably was better than the sides but all the burger was, was a huge mass of gray meat.  There was no char whatsoever, as if it was microwaved or something.  I took a few bites and didn't finish this either.  The only thing I liked about this burger was the wheat bun, but it was so doughy and starchy, way too much bread for meat.

There are very few burger joints in the area worse than this place, go to all of them and you'll know you ate better than eating at Smash Burger."}
{"text":"Awhile ago when Smashburger first came to town on Lake Mead, I gave a scathing review of one of the worst burgers I thought I had ever eaten.

And then time went by and I had a Five Guys Burger and I realized - maybe I was too hasty about Smashburger, as that burger made McDonalds look like a delicious gourmet meal at Joel Robuchon.  I found it that disgusting.

So some Groupons came up and my husband and I jetted down here because he hadn't tried it before.  And I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it compared to the first time.  So I may go back to Lake Mead and try them again and see if I can update that review some time.

But I still have issues with some of the other items - The fried pickles, onion strings, and fries are not that great, still.  And while I love a wheat bun on my burger, the one that use at Smashburger just is too doughy and big for the burgers they cook.  The regular ones (yes I know, white flour bread is bad), are much better.

I don't really go to the UNLV area that often, but if I did I would definitely come back someday."}
{"text":"Yuck!  What a grease bomb.  I don't see what all the hype is all about.  I'm giving it 2 stars because the staff really tried.  They noticed that I didn't like my first choice and brought me something else.   Great staff, poor menu."}
{"text":"What I ordered:
Baja chicken smashburger with lettuce wrapped with no bun (gluten issue). Item should have a chicken patty, guacamole, Chipotle mayo, lettuce, onion, pepperjack cheese and tomato wrapped in lettuce.

What I received:'
Thin piece of gristly chicken, pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, JALEPENO slices (not a listed ingredient on the menu) with NO guacamole and NO mayo with a side of ranch. 

When asked about the first girl quickly dodged me saying she was new (understandable) the second girl had me dissect my chicken sandwich to prove the ingredients were indeed missing. I also pointed out the addition of fresh jalapeños and showed her that the ingredient was not listed as an item in the menu to which she replied \"yes they are\" so I again pointed to the menu and showed her it was not listed as an item, to which she replied \"ohh but they are and ingredient\" and ip suggested adding it to the ingredients list on the menu. I also ordered vedgie frites that were basically just deep fried green beans anad a couple carrort slices that were just greasy and very undercooked. The chicken was very gristly I ended up throwing it out and getting something else for lunch. This place sure has gone downhill, I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"They take FOREVER. For a burger I'm only paying five dollars for, I shouldn't have to wait fifteen minutes. I work at another store in the marketplace and have a short break, so coming here again won't be an option."}
{"text":"We've had good experiences here in the past, but it's amazing how far downhill it's fallen. The line was out the door, but they still only had 1 of their 2 registers open. Based on all the help the cashier needed operating the register from the manager, it's their first week on the job. The staff at the online order pickup window was rude and curt.

I'll definitely think twice before stopping here again."}
{"text":"This used to be a good burger joint. I must say I'm disappointed. I ordered 2 big classic burgers, WELL DONE, because their burgers tend to be undercooked normally. Guess what? These were full of pink undercooked meat. I even heard the guy bagging the food \"double check\" with the cook. Yep, all good...not!
I also ordered 2 sides of smash fries. Guess what? NOT Smash fries...regular fries. How sad. I can see messing up one thing, but two?! Thank goodness my order didn't have anything else to it. 
On a side not, they have changed their fries. They used to be thin and long and now they are the medium sized ones you get at any fast food place.
I have to say, I won't be back to this location. You dodge homeless people out front, parking is horrible and the inferior level of food service justify my decision. The only thing good about this visit was the girl who took the order, she was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, she wasn't preparing the food!
For the $19 I paid, I could've gone to McDonald's and got better, hotter, fresher food and probably more of it!
Oh well, live and learn and avoid this Smashburger. Not worth it."}
{"text":"First time here
Excellent food and impressive service!

The smash fries are crispy and tasty
The haystack onion rings are perfectly cooked

The burgers are amazing flavorful and juicy

Thanks for the great food and friendly service!!"}
{"text":"My latest experience at this location wasn't great as it used to be. This review is based solely on last night's visit and the black bean patty.

Upon arrival, the lady just looked at me, walked away and didn't greet me at all. After a few minutes of just waiting at the register, she finally came over and said \"Alright.\" (Not even a proper greeting such as \"Hi there what would you like to order?\") and stared at me until I gave my order. I was a little taken aback at her lack of customer service but just ignored it and preceded with my order. 

I was excited to try the Black Bean burger patty that they offer so I got that as a large Classic Smash. That excitement went away with my first bite - I didn't expect the patty to be so mushy and lack any \"bite\" to it; it barely felt like I was eating a burger at all. I was disappointed since the classic smash used to be my favorite when I used to eat meat but this was a disappointment. I wish they would come out with a veggie patty in the future and possibly vegan options. 

I did appreciate the fact that they upgraded my Smash fries to a large even though I paid for a small but that was the only best thing of the meal last night. Not sure if I'll give them another try but others may enjoy the varieties of burgers that include chicken, beef or turkey as the patty option as well as salads and milkshakes. They also serve beer that you can enjoy with your meal."}
{"text":"Well one thing is for sure, the parking did get worse as I suspected. This center is restaurant central for East Elliot Rd. Burgers, Sandwiches, Pizza, Burritos and a Bakery. Wow, you can find whatever you want, except easy parking when the center is busy. Regardless, C and I visit this location at least monthly. 
On this visit our cashier was Michael. He was very polite, didn't make us feel rushed and totally hooked C up with his \"extra\" pickles request.
C got his usual, Kids Smashburger ($5.49). And as usual, he asks for extra extra extra extra pickles. When his burger arrived, there were 22 pickles along side his burger. Nice. The patty was cooked to his liking at the fries were hot and not overly salted. C ate it up.
I got the Arizona Smash ($6.59) and a Reg. order of fries ($1.99). The Arizona Smashburger is topped with Habanero cheese, guacamole, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato and onion. I got the chipotle mayo on the side. The patty was seasoned just right, cooked right and tasted great. This is a good burger.
The dining room was clean and the background music was at a proper level.
C and I got 2 great burgers, fries and drinks for $17 and change. 
Questionable parking. Great Burgers. Great Fries. Pleasant Staff. Clean Dining Room. Fair Prices. 4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"This location is far and away not anywhere near where I live. But, C's East Valley Children's Theater performance troupe was putting on a couple of shows out in the east valley. We had an hour between shows and found this location. Pulling up I knew what to expect because I've been to a few other locations.
The dining area was a bit dirty but I assumed that was because we were in the middle of the Saturday lunch rush and they just hadn't gotten to cleaning them. We were still able to find a clean table with no problem.
C ordered the Kid's Smash with pickles. The patty was seasoned nicely and the cheese was ooey gooey goodness that covered that patty nicely. The patty fit the bun as well which is nice to see. When it comes to Kid's meals there are places out there that shrink the burger patty for some reason. Not here. C also got fries with his kid's meal and it looked like a full order of fries, which was a nice suprise. 
I ordered the \"Creat Your Own\" burger. I had the big burger with the classic egg bun. Then added sliced aged cheddar, cucumbers, grilled onions, lettuce, pickles, tomato and yellow mustard. Again, the patties were nicely seasoned and cooked properly. All of the added ingredients seemed fresh. My one complaint would be that the grilled onions were a bit greasy. But overall, Winner winner Big Burger dinner. I added an order of fries which came out hot and crispy. Nicely done.
Good burgers, good service, messy dining area, prices a bit high. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING burger.  Their fries are excellent as well.  I also like the fact that they do not use iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a burger or even a shake. You can get the burger basically anyway you want it. They also offer chicken sandwiches and salads. I love the smashfries. I've been meaning to try their shakes but I just haven't gotten around to it yet. I'm usually already full by the time I finish the burger and fries."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly. The toilets were duel flush. The burger was tasty and the fresh brewed green ice tea had just a bit of sweetness. The beef hamburger was smashed just a bit too oversized for the egg bun and towards the finish, the outside beef broke off. It was the first time I had a smash burger. The cheese was melted, the bun was toasted and the onions were grilled. I thought the beef was a bit too greasy, but the caramelization and tad bit of charing on the burger with just the right amount of seasoning added to its deliciousness. Not quite my type of burger, but worth a try. I love grilled onions, egg hamburger buns and a nicely caramelized chunk of beef."}
{"text":"I tried out smashburger for the first time tonight and it was pretty tasty. I got the chicken avocado club with no bacon and my wife got the smashburger regular size. We also got a side of fries. The chicken was really tender and moist and the flavoring was really good. My wife said that the burger was really yummy too. The fries were really good also. Shoestring fries and cooked perfectly. I also thought that it had a nice setup and was a pleasant dining in experience. Would definitely go again in the future."}
{"text":"Loving Smashburger, great burger tried the sin city and bacon avocado with the sweet potato fries yumm. Great for kids and great customer service both times. I do wish they would sell a brownie or something besides shakes. Either way I Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Heads up, the Bacon cheeseburger does not come with lettuce. Asked for some and got some for free though. The burger was great. Also had an order of smash fries. The only downfall is paying strip prices for fast food. Would definitely recommend though."}
{"text":"I had never been here before, but was expecting really good food, this was not the case. When I ordered there did not appear to be anyone waiting for their food, however,  there actually were many that had been sitting down around the food court. My food (it was only me) took at least 15 minutes and the shake was not ready. The french fries were really pretty bad, cold and grease running so that the bag was saturated thoroughly. I did think the hamburger was good. I do not think I ever would have been served my shake if I had not asked again for it from the cashier about three minutes later. When it arrived, it was a full four inches below the lip of the cup. After considering the rest of the experience it was a little funny but pretty sad as well. The shake tasted good. But the service and lack of organization was bad."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here recently after going to the nearby outlets.  I had the avocado club burger.  It was super good.  Nice fresh avocado, ranch dressing and tomato.  I did not realize it did not come with cheese so next time, it will be something I had.  I had the fried pickles as my side.  They are not on the menu anymore but you can ask for them.  They were nicely fried and good dipping sauce.  My mom had the bbq bacon burger.  She enjoyed hers.  She had onion strings as her side.  They were really good - nice a crispy with a light batter.  

This location was super busy but the staff seemed to handle it well.  Cleaning off the tables frequently and apologizing for the wait for our food.  It actually was not a long wait but it was nice to be looked after."}
{"text":"My family has eaten here quite a few times now. We love it. My husband usually gets the Arizona burger and consistently likes it. I used to get the bbq/bacon/cheddar burger and loved it (though I feel it could have used a little more bbq). Recently I've been trying to eat healthier and have switched to the spinach/cucumber/goat cheese chicken burger. Love. Really, it's fantastic. I'm also a fan of the veggie frites. I've never been disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"Best burgers EVER!!! The fries are bomb too! Wait times were good and the price was so worth the food. Wish they had a smash burger in my area"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner with my boyfriend and the service was PHENOMENAL! Our food came out quickly, except for our fried pickles. However our waitress was very apologetic and even gave us a coupon for a free meal since they took not even five minutes longer than the rest of our food. The staff at this location is beyond friendly! We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I give this 5 stars great person behind the counter comped my fries be a it was my first time being there. Bbq bacon cheddar was great full of flavor and the smash fries were very good! I suggest all to try it out!"}
{"text":"To start off...I am not a big fan of burgers. It is about the last thing I will pick as a food option given a choice. Well we came here for a burger one night and wow, I was impressed. The burger was delicious!!! We both got the BBQ, Bacon and Cheddar burger. The best parts of this burger were the haystack onions and the bacon. I got the BBQ sauce on the side. The burger was SO juicy! The fries were delicious. The staff went out of their way to be super friendly and helpful. 

Now if given the choice...I just may pick a burger as an option to eat, so long as it is at a Smashburger."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger with mayo, ketchup, BBQ sauce, spicy Chipotle, bacon, and a egg. The burger came out really well. I also ordered a side of Spicy Buffalo Fries thinking they where going to be actual hot sauce on the fries. Little did I know the Spicy Buffalo was a seasoning that was way over salty no taste just pure salt. Other than that the burger was good and service was good."}
{"text":"I'll try to give this place the benefit of a doubt. More or less leaning towards 3.5 stars solely because of it's convenience and pricing.

When staying at the RIO a lot of their food options don't open until 4pm or so (lame) so you are generally limited in your options unless you go offsite, room service, etc. Plus, when you're in Vegas for more than just a couple days, one can appreciate that you aren't going to pay a small fortune by eating at Smashburger. 

I got a classic smash with fries. The fries...I'm sorry folks, these were awful. Cold...pre-frozen, flavorless. 
The burger itself wasn't too bad. The house sauce is tasty and it was just the perfect amount. Beef patty was decently seasoned and the toppings were fresh. If I had to eat again, I'd just order something without the fries, no biggie. One cool thing about this place is that the receipt held a code for $2 off your next purchase (within a few days time) which I suppose is nice. 

This place is nothing to write home about and am a little sad they didn't really have options outside of a burger but you can't really complain when you can get a full meal for under $15."}
{"text":"They say first impressions mean everything. My first impression here was the worst experience I have had in recent memory.

Trying to place an order was a joke. The girl was standing at the register, playing on her phone, while looking at us every few seconds. My wife and I were in shock that we were standing right there and she wouldn't help us and the other person was tending to a customer (he left because of how rude everyone was and the entire staff just laughs).

After a minute the girl just blurts out \"we are out of fries\". How can you be out of fries? My wife and I decided to try the sweet potato fries and the onion straws (I posted a picture because they were a joke). When the guy was done, after his guest left, we were told to go there, while the girl that should've taken our order went over to the kitchen area and picked up something to eat. That is unsanitary!

We ordered our sides and burgers, paid more for the burger ones (what a joke) and the guy in the kitchen made a jester that there actually weren't onion straws but there was mumbling and we were charged for them. 

Order placed and we go sit down. I am so confused on why there are so many people working. Out of maybe ten employees, two or three were working. Two staff members were throwing cups at each other, throwing stuff in the kitchen, drinking drinks near people's orders, it was awful! Where was the manager?

Oh I can tell you that. He came into the place when we were sitting down, drinking a McDonalds coffee!!!  Not hiding it or anything. Guess he doesn't care at all about his store because he also walked right by the staff messing around and a girl, the one who wouldn't wait on his, just standing on the floor, playing with her phone. This place is a joke!

So someone walked to our table and said there were no onion straws and stood there. Furious at this point, I said I want my money back on them since there were no fries and we didn't want two orders of sweet potato fries. She said she'd get the manager. Walked back to the corner the manager was at. A table with friends I think, walked right by us and said nothing. Our food came up and there were onion straws, which was confusing. An order of onion straws that looked like a joke at $2.50. What does the manager do? Walked near us and says \"oh guess we have them\", laughed, and walked away.

Never did he say sorry or even acknowledge us. He still had his McDonalds coffee though.

The more I write this the more I get angry. This place is a joke. The manager doesn't care about anything, health codes were being broken, and the staff doesn't care. Everyone is rude!!

Oh yeah the food. Not the best. Overpriced. Can't help but think our big burgers weren't really the big ones because they were small.

Pass on this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I've been to many Smashburger locations, and I usually get the same experience at each location.

You can order from burgers to salad to shakes. For burgers, you can create your own or pick one of their signature burgers. Even with pick a signature burger, you can pick the size and the type of meat, which I think is awesome so people can still try the signature burger even if they don't eat certain meat. My go-to burger is the regular Sin City burger. I love trying burgers that have egg in them, and this burger has egg, onion strings, bacon, cheese, and, of course, the patty. Everything compliments each other very well! I also love the Smash Fries, which are skinny fries seasoned with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.

My overall experience here was good. The employees were nice and the are was pretty clean."}
{"text":"Why did my chicken burger look like a filet of trout?  Just wasn't expecting the thin sliced piece of chicken.  That was a....surprise.  It was pretty good but because of the texture/size, I  really ended up with more bread in my mouth than anything.

Husband liked his burger but it was just okay.  Nothing great.
Sweet potato fries were tasty.  The place was packed!

Nice quick meal option I suppose.  They didn't gain a new loyal fan right off the bat but I would revisit in a pinch."}
{"text":"The service on this visit was fantastic. Friendly and quick.
The bacon cheeseburger was ok.  I don't know how the bun gets so soggy so quick, the top was good, the bottom was like eating a wet dishrag.  
The burger was well seasoned but undercooked a bit.
The haystack onion rings were excellent with a spicy sauce to dip but the fries are boring and flavorless."}
{"text":"Smashburger is an experience that I have wanted to try.  So we walk in and instructed to take a menu, controll our excitement and then order at the counter.  I actually was amused by this and the menu sounded great.  I mean you get to pick your bun and a large amount of topping choices.  The buns were excellent, crisp and flavorful instead of wilted and soft like most hamburger joints.  I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and they put the BBQ sauce on the side making me happy as I like to control the amount of sauce on my burger.  The wife made a blue cheese and avocado burger on a spicy bun.  Overall the burgers were decent but I am not sure whether it is due to the smashing or just poor chefmanship but our burgers were overcooked.  

The atmosphere is so so, diner style seating with a few old school vegas photos hanging around.  For kids they have hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese and some chicken.

The fries are thin and rubbery, almost an afterthought.  I have had better fries nearly everywhere.

I wish the burgers were slightly less cooked as the bun was worth coming here for.  Alas, the search for the perfect burger continues."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Fried pickles & gourmet burgers .. I mean where can u go wrong??"}
{"text":"Definitely better than I thought it was going to be. Friendly staff. Good food. Chill location."}
{"text":"This place is ok... I had a crispy chicken sandwich, my better half had the grilled chicken sandwich. Both were actually really great! We shared an order of regular fries which were pretty good, too. The wait for our food was pretty ridiculous, but outside of that the restaurant itself was clean and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try Smashburger, and now that I have, I won't be back.  There was just nothing special about it.  The burger was good, but not great, and I felt overpriced for what it was, and the side salad was so small filled with more onions than anything else, gross! I didn't get a shake but neighboring table did and seriously I would have been pretty upset that they didn't even fill it to the top. They're new and many people are trying them for the first time, I hope they make improvements soon so people have a different opinion and go back a second time.  I know I won't."}
{"text":"Ran pick up food for a quick to go lunch took over 30 minutes to get food.  Got to the car and the order was wrong and fortunately didn't have time to go back."}
{"text":"Love Love LOVE this location! I work incredibly close to this smashburger location and whenever i get the craving for junk food (which honestly, occurs more often than it should), I drive over and order some food to go. Buffalo fries are addictive! Tastes like wings but are french fries. Best thing in the world. Staff is incredibly cordial and welcoming-- especially Bret!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh juicy burgers and awesome grilled fresh chicken sandwiches. Yummy kids menu and delicious shakes!"}
{"text":"The other day I ordered online and it ended up missing an order or fries. Not a big deal. Today I went and talked to the manager about it and he was very understanding and offered to take care of it! The food here is great and delicious!! Ron I believe is the manger on duty when I went in and he did a great job handling the situation!"}
{"text":"I am not very picky about most of my food. The exception to that rule is burgers.  I am picky and a bit of a snob about my burgers.  I have seen Smashburger around town for a while and I talked about trying it out, but never got around to it.  I wish i made the time sooner, i missed out by not eating here sooner.  I took my burger wingman (my son) out to lunch one day, and decided to give it a try. 

The burgers were awesome, and was secretly happy when my son did not enjoy the Smash Fries because it left more for me. As i am a good father, I purchase him an order of regular fries and he very much enjoyed them.  As I am better than a 'good' father I also let him get a shake and he enjoyed that as well.  

The food was so good, that at a later date when my wife and I were in Flagstaff, AZ I took her to a Smashburger and she enjoyed the burger but unfortunately also enjoyed the Smash Fried and ate half my order.  I will get two next time."}
{"text":"After a long day in the car and a hankering for a burger and fries, we saw the Smashburger sign. Oh! Sweet, Divine Providence!!
The Truffle Mushroom Swiss burger saved my life!
The perfect ratio of meat to bun to fancy stuff.  The flavors were a fantastic marriage of bold and mellow. 
Perfect meal at the end of a day."}
{"text":"Smash Burger is between a fast food burger joint and a sit down restaurant.  They call it smash burger because they smash the meat down on the grill. It is nice dining area pretty good service.

They have good burgers there.  I ordered the Las Vegas burger, it comes with a bunch of topping including an egg.  I really enjoyed the burger.  It was over the top with all the toppings but it worked.  The hamburger patty tasted like a real hamburger... it was real thick and juicy...

The order of fries was plenty for my girls and I.  So you don't need to order fries for everyone.  

It is similar to 5 guys if that helps."}
{"text":"Two words: Smash fries!  They are smothered, roasted, sauteed (ok, maybe they are just cooked) with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic... YUM!  And as the Black Eyed Peas would tell you, \"I just can't get enough!\"

And the burgers are tasty too.  I have heard that Smash Burger actually pulls angels down from heaven and smashes them down into their burgers.  Unconventional perhaps, but you can't argue with results!  And those results are greasy and delicious burgers that moisten your bun but never reach the level of fall-apart-in-your-hands messy!  

The only negative is that we have officially gotten to the point where a $10 fast food burger is accepted and expected.

Eat well, my friends..."}
{"text":"I am not sure of the surprise by many that this place opened up so close to In N Out as many retailers/restaurants move next to their competition. These burgers are competitively priced compared to other \"gourmet\" burger joints. The SmashBurger was good and I would suggest you give the Smashfires with rosemary and olive oil a try."}
{"text":"One of the best burguers ever!
Dont like the skinny fries tho, but the burguer was so juicy and the milkshake so delicious i didnt care"}
{"text":"AJUAN provided Awesome Customer Service! He has provided the best experience yet at this location. Very knowledgeable and very helpful. Great food and Great service you can go wrong here."}
{"text":"The Smashfries are DEFREEKINGLICIOUS!!!  I also loved the grilled Arizona Chicken Smashburger sandwich.  I have also had the classic Smashburger with their yummy Smashburger sauce.  So good!  I also really appreciate the ability to order a smaller meat portion burger.  Their malts are also verrrry good.  Highly recommend!  Not really diet food though haha!"}
{"text":"I come to this Smashburger location all the time, my order is correct and it comes out in no time. However today it was the complete opposite. I came in and immediately can tell it was somewhat busy. So after I order I walk away to get my drink and realize that I didn't get my number, which is not a big deal. So I get my number and I sit, about 15-20 min I get my food, that's a really long time compared to the times I've been here. I receive my food and they read me what I ordered but they gave me my food wrong so I tell her it was wrong and she takes it back. I then waited another 15 min for the food again and seemed fine. As I'm about to eat it I noticed my order was wrong again. I go up to them and let them know it was wrong and tried to blame it on me saying that's how I ordered it and they just made a whole new burger. I was not a fan of them trying to prove a customer wrong especially with some attitude. I then waited another 10 min and finally my order was correct. I waited 40 min for my food and I was so excited but sadly this visit wasn't the best."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food. I had the bacon avocado burger. Scrumptious! But I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about the over the top-AMAZNG-ethical-personable staff at this Smashburger at The Rio. We got in to Vegas very late. We were starving and tired. We got our food, scarfed it down and left to go check out the casino. When we went back to our room, my husband realized he had lost his phone. Panic set in, DEEP! We raced back to the casino to re trace our steps. We couldn't find it anywhere. I just knew it was long gone. I finally went back to Smashburger, the cashier recognized me(Emmanuel, I believe he said his name). He said they found a black phone and took it to security. As I was taking the escalator down Cedric (another Smashburger employee) recognized me and walked me over to the security desk (I was a little lost). Not only did he walk me over there but he waited with me until a security officer came over and described the phone to the officer. I am beyond words to say how thankful I am for the over the top customer service and honesty!!! Thank you Emmanuel, Cedric and Smashburger! You guys have an amazing team. Thank you! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Repeat after me.... truffle mushroom swiss burger.  Say that 5 times and you will then find yourself magically in your car headed for Smashburger.  This is one of the best burgers you can get anywhere!  The sweet potato fries are awesome as well.

Gotta go.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Fresh, hot and delicious.   Good service, good clean space, friendly smiling staff.  Make sure you order the smash fries they are well worth it.  

I made the mistake of ordering a second patty on a BIG burger.  It made for a huge sandwich that was hard to finish. It was delicious and tasty but just a bit too much for one meal."}
{"text":"The Smashburger is a very tasty burger.  The problem is that they are 7+ bucks and keep getting smaller.   There were three of us and order three sandwiches, 2 smash fries, 1 veggie fries, 2 fountain drinks and the bill was $36.   The value just isn't there with The Habit and In N Out just a mile away. 

The place was clean.   The service was super fast. The staff made several stops to make sure we were happy.  Makes it a struggle when the food is tasty and the service is good when the meal is over priced.   I think I will spend my dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"We all know what a Smashburger tastes like.  We all know how good the Smash fries are.   We all know how good the milkshakes are.  

What makes a Smashburger is the service and this location has no mojo.   The two guys working front of house were just awful on the Wednesday we visited.  They were slow, uninterested and just did not want to be there.  They would clean tables and the run the resister and then deliver food without washing hands between.  

Out group had three of us place orders and the fourth in our party waited about 5 minutes before they took his order.  Of course this meant three of us had our food well before the fourth.  Just messed up the whole lunch experience and that last member of our party was rushed as the rest of us were done.  

Three of us were charged differently than the fourth member of our party as well.  Seems that one of the front house staff was trained differently than the other order taker. We pointed it out and a guy named Todd corrected it which was cool.  But it underscores the problem with this location.   What you want in a fast food joint is consistent experience, fast service and a little thought into order process.   That does not happen at this place.  Too bad.......Smashburger is a great brand that this location is tarnishing."}
{"text":"Went to a movie with wife and daughter and wanted a great burger. It's so nice when you can get absolutely great service. David Newman was at the cashier and I did ask if he was the manager. He said yes and asked if everything was ok. I said yes and assumed any worker that can treat a customer that nice has to be an owner or manager. Then we went to sit outside and the night was tipped off with Trent the server who actually told my teenage daughter that we were cool parents. Can't wait to come back. To see the youth of today take such pride in there work  gives me much hope"}
{"text":"Military discount while in uniform, is always a bonus maybe next time ya ok who we kidding.   Two Sin City Smash Burgers, French Frys and Smash Frys completed our order, and we almost licked the paper outta the baskets.  This was a great burger.  Service was impeccable so friendly and attentive to your requests, people kept telling us to try this place only wish we hadn't waited this long!"}
{"text":"\"Fine\" dining. food was fine. service was fine. atmosphere was fine....but just that-fine. Nothing to write home about, but also nothing to really complain about. They do offer fried banana peppers as a side snack, which is different and tasty."}
{"text":"Smash Burger is the bomb. For a lower priced burger (in-n-out, The Habit) this place rocks. Burgers are definitely heavier so i always end up ordering the small burger. My burger of choice is the Sin City Burger. Fried egg on it is legit. I get the sauce on the side so i can control the amount on the burger (first time i went there was a little more than i liked). I have already been back there 3 times since my first visit. AND lets be honest. A place that stays open that is litterally next door to an INNY? Has to be good."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch, pretty damn good burger and they have tater tots!!!! Will defiantly come back here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"So my first visit to this location was just okay.

First, let's start by the ordering process. I arrived shortly before 12, just beating the lunch crowd. After reviewing the menu I decided to order the Classic Smashburger with cheese, however I wasn't sure the difference between the Regular vs. the Big. I asked the guy behind the counter and he proceeded to show me using his hands, I said but what is the size, again he showed me with his hands. So finally I said is one 1/4 lb etc. at that point he said yes. I told him he should probably know that vs. using his hands.
Anyway, I proceeded to take my number and find a seat. Orders are delivered, which I do like, but what surprised me was that my fries were not too fresh and somewhat over cooked. That was the disappointing part of the meal. As for the burger, I went with the Big Classic Smash with Cheese and it was cooked to perfection! The cheese was melted just right and I enjoyed their special sauce very much. That burger is something I will look forward to enjoying again!"}
{"text":"Smashburger was a nice little surprise.  Having never been before I decided to order the classic smash cheeseburger with extra pickles and a side of fries.

Once we placed our orders, filled our drinks, and sat down our burgers were delivered. They looked great and I was ready to dig in.  Although I wasn't a huge fan of the smash sauce, the burger was cooked perfectly. The cheese covered the burger and was melted too perfection. And, the pickles, OMG, classic dill, great on a burger!
As for the fries, I could eat them everyday.  Shoestring fries perfectly cooked, a little crisp but soft on the inside.
As others have mentioned prices are high for a fast food burger chain, but knowing the burgers are cooked fresh upon ordering and definitely don't taste like other \"fast food\" burgers, they are worth it in my mind.
Overall I was impressed and would definitely stop at Smashburger next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great stuff and start with manager Alex who really was nice and apologize for our food wasn't cooked properly and gave fresh new order and add more fries and gave us comeback for free visit coupons my parents were really happy from start to finish 5 star A++++*"}
{"text":"The cashier was rude and got our order wrong. We ordered a craft your own with CRISPY chicken, but she gave us GRILLED chicken. When we told her, she acted all snotty about it, and didn't offer to give us new ones. The chicken was a bit floppy, and the bun was soggy. I tried my cousins crispy tenders and they were amazing though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Us Service Dogs love hamburgers, especially when they are so tasty and juicy as they are in this place. Also have outside tables and are pet friendly!"}
{"text":"The smash fries were greasy and tasteless. Chicken smash burger with mushrooms was good. 
The dining area is small and they don't have  enough seating. There is always a long line and not enough tables."}
{"text":"Very good service.  Was not that busy so I received my good in good time.  The burger was good and the quality was the same standard as every other smash burger that u have been to."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. And the staff are the nicest and most efficient staff in this entire hotel/casino!"}
{"text":"I get the Arizona burger with a black bean party. Its awesome but always falls apart when I eat it. Sweet pot fries are good. Do not order the veggie fries, they taste like they have been marinating in oil and are not crispy. I've never had a milkshake here but they look great and have a lot of flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"We usually have a good experience here (when we sit down), but their take out is underwhelming. Each time we've done take out, the food has been somewhat soggy and cold. Today, we ordered shakes for take out the first time, and we got really... unappetizing-looking shakes. Still like this place, but would recommend sit down, rather than pick-up."}
{"text":"One of my work colleagues eats here all the time, and I drive by it enough times... and I've read about it here, so I knew at some point I would eat here. Well today was \"that\" day. 

Sunday afternoon -- the place was pretty empty. I asked if they have complimentary WiFi, the cashier stated no, because normally they are so slammed that they wouldn't want guests just lounging around hangin on WiFi. Okay......

Ordered my All-American Smashburger, onion stringys.... not bad, I think my total was around $7 + change. 

The cashier said that it would be 6min for my burger to be delivered to me. He was wrong! It was 3... :) 

Food was very good. I was nervous about the \"egg bun\"... but it looked really tasty. (Which it was.) The cheese was nicely melted on my 1/3lb patty. 

The onion strings were certainly tasty, but they were pretty messy to eat. And I don't remember there being any silverware. So yes to the mess -- and good to eat. 

I was also impressed with how attentive the staff was to make sure all the tables were cleaned. Good job! Nice to see that. 

I'll definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Arizona burger and think it's definitely in my top ten taste wise. What I don't like and have a huge issue when you pay 7 or 8 bucks for a burger is when you have to pay for fries separate. By the time I ordered fries and a drink I was at almost $13. When the average lunchtime meal is around $8 paying close to double just isn't worth it. It's disappointing that they price gouge as much as they do because the burger really is a good one and the smash fries are excellent as well. 

I took my wife, son and nephew a few weeks back and my bill was over $60. Not what I was expecting from a walk up and order restaurant."}
{"text":"They've improved a lot. The service is very friendly and the food tastes great. I did notice that there were no lemon slices by the water when I went to get some, and the portions for fries are very small. Other than that I enjoyed the food and the constant customer service and concern for if we were enjoying our meal and had everything we needed. I recommend this place, but I have it 4 instead of 5 stars because of the small fries portioning."}
{"text":"Smashburger is awesome. I'm a huge advocate for this stuff, I've tried almost their entire menu with only a few quarrels. everything is reasonably priced, you're looking to drop about 10ish dollars a person for burger, fries, and a drink.

The only small issues I have is that when ever I get the BBQ Ranch chicken sandwich its normally drowning in sauce making it hard to eat. Also making the bread some what soggy, of course you could prolly just order light sauce and fix the problem, I normally am rushed and forget until I get back to my desk  X0 

Also as incredible as their burgers are certain ones can get a bit greasy (especially my favorite the Sin City Burger) so if your not used to eating greasy foods which I'm actually not, it can do a number on your stomach. So if your a first timer just start with The 1/3 Pounder Smashburger with smash sauce, and your choice of toppings. Pick a fry, all are good, none are anything to freak out about but there all tasty.

Also plus sides normally pretty quick wait time about 5 maybe 10 min. Service is friendly and helpful, and you can buy beer and they have some pretty good brands there. I feel this is a Win, Win, Win type situation."}
{"text":"Let me save you some time and money.. go to Five Guys or In N Out 
$5 milk shake? Nothing like pulp fiction..
Hyped burger.. weak.. ate it in 6 bites.."}
{"text":"The burger and fries overly dripped grease and tasted like grease. Not good; never going back."}
{"text":"Yeah no thanks... disorganized, short staffed, super slow. When we went to find a table every table needed to be cleaned because it had the last customers tray still waiting to be bussed. We waited quite a while for two burgers and a kids burger. The kids meal came to the table and then a few minutes later my classic smash burger came out. You would think something that had the company's name would be cooked to perfection but the cheese was so burnt it wasn't edible. We canceled our order because the last hamburger still wasn't even delivered to our table yet!Although the girl that gave us our refund was sweet about it you don't see ANY Management visibility this goes for the two locations we've visited. Smashburger, hire some help for your staff and hire a Manager to correct all the issues your customers are experiencing... Great product but poor execution!"}
{"text":"Much better visit than the last couple of times we have been here. Staff was attentive and professional and the dining area was very clean. Our food came out quickly and nice and hot! You can tell there is a huge management presence now, as it should be. It's visits like this that will make us want to return. Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"I like that they have different choices for fries here.  I prefer just the regular fries however.  My favorite burger is the Arizona Smash burger.  It has jalepenos, guac and cheese on it.  You can also get it with chicken instead of beef.  This place is a little pricier than other fast food burger places but it tastes a bit better in my opionin.  Hard to describe, so try it for yourself and see."}
{"text":"The food here is good.  Tasty burgers and fries with lots of options for what kind of burger you want.  It's a little pricey, but still cheaper than Five Guys and better in my opinion.  My only complaint about this place is the location/layout of all their restaraunts.  This one for instance is on the corner and has a \"L\" shape to it.  I thought I parked in front but apparently after walking in I realized I was in the rear entrance and had to maneuver myself to the line and it was annoying because these places are all so small.  Maybe they should have some that have a drive thru.  Would be a lot easier."}
{"text":"This was definitely a meh experience....although I guess that should have been expected. I built my own burger with a wheat bun, cheddar, lettuce, haystack onion, ketchup and mustard. It was greasy and underwhelming. All I could taste was the mustard.... I think there was too much of it. The BF and I shared some smashfries which were weird tasting.... not really good.... just weird. I was hoping for more garlic flavor. Overall.... it was just a meh experience."}
{"text":"I was amazed today that it took more time to actually order my food then to receive it. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. Though my only complaint was the Nutter Butter Milkshake. Not really a sweets fan but it sounded good. The Milkshake was great, it just didn't taste too much like Nutter Butters. In fact it seemed like they used one cookie, and half of the cookie was stuck in the whip cream as a garnish."}
{"text":"Dominic took my order and got everything correct. My order was very complicated and I know it's easy to misunderstand when an order is placed over the phone. They continue to get my orders on point and provide the best customer service."}
{"text":"I've been craving a burger all day and finally listened to my gut. Nick took our order and got everything right. He was friendly and even recommended trying a new burger since I always get the Arizona. I tried the haystack and think I found my new favorite. Their food is always bomb and you can't go wrong with the smash fries. I've never had a bad burger from Smash. Keep up the work and thank you."}
{"text":"I went to this smashburger when they first opened and the service was not very good.  Now I went and it was phenomenal.  Kennedy was professional, friendly, and helpful.  The restaurant was clean and our food came out promptly.  Our fries were hot and the burgers were juicy!  This location is excellent now and keep up the good work! And Kennedy is an asset to your company!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about.. This place is too expensive and the food is too salty. On the positive side, the service was really good.  Will I go back? No, there are better places."}
{"text":"Food is always great. But yesterday we were there and although food was good. Service was awful and the tables were dirty. Food left on tables for the hour we were there. We had to ask them to clean a table for us. There was one other family in there besides us. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a SmashBurger in Las Vegas. The location itself was clean. The lady that took our order not so nice, first she seemed like we were a inconveince and next when we asked about a military discount she said, \"they are all ran different.\" Thank you lady we'll go to a different location next time. The food was amazing! I love the SmashChicken! They have about ten different variations and of course they have about twelve or more variations of the SmashBurger. Also the SmashSides the sweet potato fries are amazing!!! I will def visit another SmashBurger just not this one."}
{"text":"The food was good, tasted fresh and was quick to deliver to table. 
We came in first thing in the morning. 10:00am the place was pretty dirty. Fries on the floor and crumbs on sticky seats and sticky tables. 
The employees are super nice. 

The bathroom (female) was dirty and the toilet was pretty gross. I just went in to wash my hands before we ate.  
Three stars because it's pretty dirty."}
{"text":"Another first for us since moving west. Husband enjoyed crafting his own burger. His creation was a burger with blue cheese and onion straws. Makes my moth water just thinking about it. He enjoyed it with a side of regular fries.  I had a regular burger without a bun and sweet potato fries. Loved the fries and the burger tasted wonderful. Smashburger is a great place for a quick meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is my favorite SmashBurger location in Vegas! The staff is really hospitable and sweet, their food is amazing, and it's at a really great location.

You MUST try their sweet potato fries and their Smash Fries!"}
{"text":"The burgers were good and the meat they use is great. However, that being said, the fact that you get a burger, only a burger, and nothing but the burger for the money bugs! Any \"sides\" cost extra. The day we were there it was also VERY SLOW! On a Saturday afternoon, during the lunch hour, they had one person working the register taking orders with a line out the door and shouting, (while she took orders) \"Welcome to Smash Burger\" or \"Thanks for coming to Smash Burger\" every time the door opened for people to come in or to leave. We had the kids with us and the waiting time was insane not only to order, but also to get our food. Not a good place to take young children when you need to be in and out with hungry children with short attention spans. Probably won't be going back when we can get faster service and more food for the money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always good food and great service the guys there were really nice very helpful the burger was awesome I'm a big eater so I should've ordered two but most people will not be left hungry. They have really good tea as well."}
{"text":"I am updating my review after speaking with the manager, Ryan. After a pleasant discussion over the phone, I advised Ryan I would give Smashburger another chance as his customer service (by reaching out) significantly improved the standing of his establishment.

My three children and I went today for lunch, about 11:30. I was assisted by Colin, who was pleasant and helpful. We were seated quickly, to a clean table, and our food made it out in approximately 5 minutes. The ingredients were fresh, and the burgers (the original) were good, as were the fries. Colin and another gentleman assisted when my 11 year old asked for smash sauce and ranch. They both arrived promptly, and with a smile. The Restaraunt was busy, but service (which is huge for me) did not suffer. 

I want to thank Ryan for changing my mind about this location. It was a pleasant experience for me and my three children. I appreciated both Ryan's and Colin's customer service, and because of that customer service I will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Smashburger and it was a smashing success.

Having never been to one before, I asked what the difference was between the regular burger and the big burger. The response was \"it's the difference between being full and still being hungry.\" Excellent answer!

I got my own jab in when asked if my order was for here or to go. \"For here...although technically I will be taking it with me when I leave.\" Hey-O!

I had the BBQ, Bacon, Cheddar big burger. It was outstanding. I also got a regular order of the Smashfries. I really liked the Smashfries although the portion was really small. Yeah, I got the regular size, but it was smaller than I expected. They lost a star for that.

Overall though, very good food, very friendly and fun staff, and this particular location was very clean.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome and kicks In-N-Out's ass! I think I've found my #1 burger joint. I'm not going to go on telling you how good it is, I just recommend you come try it. When I was here I ordered my own \"Make Your Own Burger\" that way I made it to how I like it and boy did they make my burger just perfect. I will come back here to try their fried pickles and chili beef stuffs. I can't wait to come back and put other toppings in my burger, something that In-N-Out burger will never do.

Thumbs up guys keep my burger nice and warm for my next visit."}
{"text":"The burger itself reminds me of freddy's steakburger, but the only difference is that this place is a little bit more expensive. Everything about this place is just ok, so don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"Literally waited 30 minutes for my burger. They have THREE people working the fucking line. Maybe if you spent as much money having employees working, as you charge people for food, people would be happier."}
{"text":"After sub par experiences at other locations, Brian P. & I frequent this location quite a lot. Their Baja Cobb salad & haystack onions are killer. 

Compared to other Smash locations, this one used to be on top of their game. They had a great manager who was efficient and kept the place in great shape. He got promoted and now the staff is a wreck.

Now when we go, tables are not being bussed. Having 6 empty tables and all are filthy and uncleared, coupled with long lines is a disaster. Past few times we've been given plastic cutlery instead of metal. Last time I was given a plastic knife and a metal fork. Odd.

In addition to the unbussed tables & disposable cutlery, the last time I went, the door to the kitchen was open. It looked like a prep garbage can had exploded on the floor. Food waste, paper basket liners and general trash was on the floor in a pile. 

I love the food here but management needs help fast."}
{"text":"Amanda and Jay Z were the most friendly, pleasant and helpful helpful staff I've ever had. Super clean establishment, quick and efficient service, amazing hot, juicy burgers, and ample parking make this my favorite Smashburger to visit. Love the sweet potato fries with smash sauce as well!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Polite and respectful.  Good atmosphere.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"The Buffalo Blue Cheese chicken sandwhich is my favorite! Smash fries are great, and so is the Classic Smash. I like that they have the Four Peak's Peach Ale at a counter service restaurant. It can get pretty pricey here, but the quality of the food is fresh and the staff is very accomodating. After ordering at the counter, your food is delivered to your table and the employees seem genuine about delivering an excellent experience. You can fill out the survey on your receipt after each visit for a free fry, as well!"}
{"text":"I ended up waiting in line for 10 minutes before walking out never able to order. While waiting in line for an extraordinary amount of time I observed as the cooks did not wear their proper uniforms (no hats or hair nets). I also observed as a the cooks where eating while prepping the food. 

I did not know the cooks or the leader on duty during this time but these health violations need to be addressed."}
{"text":"Decor: modern and clean 

Service: 4 stars

Food: 4 stars

Ordered the club burger with an egg bun. It came with avacado, bacon lettuce and tomato. Bacon was crisp, avacado was a decent portion. Also ordered the smash fries which are tossed in truffle oil and rosemary. The fries were thin and tasty but i would avoid the ranch dressing that tastes like processed Hidden Valley or similar! We also got the truffle burger which was amazing.

They have a few good beers to select from."}
{"text":"I got the sin city (cheese burger with fried egg, bacon, crispy onion on an egg bun). The patty tasted fresh and was really juicy. Nothing too wild on the burger. I also got smash fries, which are essentially truffle fries, also tasty but too greasy for me. For desert we tried the Oreo mint shake which was delicious!! Definitely the highlight of our meal."}
{"text":"They charged us for two fries, only gave us one and charged extra for goat cheese on my burger and the forgot the goat cheese. The food is good but the service is really hit or miss."}
{"text":"Tastes like throw up, bathroom had piss on the walls. Paper towels all over. Horrible customer service. ABORT MISSION!"}
{"text":"Food was good as always. It was pretty busy all the available tables were dirty. Let manager know he cleaned a table for us right away. Then our food took longer than it should have to get out. I am giving 4 stars because even though there was issues the manager recognized it without us complaining and gave us free entree certificates and was very apologetic."}
{"text":"Drop in here with a Groupon with the family in tow.  Really surprised by the quality and taste associated with the burger i got (BBQ, Bacon & Cheddar \"smash\" sized burger on a wheat bun, with a side of fried pickles).  all in all, i was initially a little unimpressed, until the freshness of the ingredients and the quality of the preparation hit me with the first bite.  
First of all, although not the most massive burger on their menu, it was filling without leaving me feeling stuffed sick (as can be common with other comparable burger joints - firve guys, in and out, fatburger, etc).
the kids loved the kids cheese burgers (no real surprise there), and aside from too much bun on their burgers, their meals were also a hit.  wife got an arizona burger, which while not for me, was a hit for her.  will definitely return and the fried pickles were also great, if you like pickles."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Smashburger, love love love and so happy we finally have one in Laveen!"}
{"text":"Saturday after noon this place was crowded. There was quite a line at the counter. The dining area was also full so tables would fill up as soon as they were empty. First time to a Smashburger so I wanted to see if they were as good as they claim. I ordered a Twin Cities Burger. This had a smashed burger, grilled onions, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on an onion bun. I also ordered a side of the haystack onions. They said they would bring it out so we found the cleanest dirty table as no available table was clean. 
The food was out in a reasonable amount of time for as busy as the were. My burger was ok. It wasn't a whole lot different than anyone else's non frozen burger. The onion haystack is something I won't order again. They were very oily. The carton they came in was soaked through. I should have left them alone as I got an upset stomach later on. 
I don't know if I will return to Smashburger or at least this one. Because the tables were dirty, the onion haystack oily, and the price a bit high, this place just missed the \"Places I Avoid\" list."}
{"text":"Ok...I am addicted to their burgers. Great selection and never had a bad meal here. Hats off to their customer service...was very impressed with both Samantha and Josh...really customer oriented.  If you get the Smash Burger App there are great deals and coupon offers....only one coupon per visit.  Place is clean and a local favorite. Been to 5 Brothers and In & Out Burger but keep coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Food: small Classic Smashburger, no cheese, no sauce, no red onion. Add grilled onions. That's my jam! I'm never disappointed. Smashburger makes the best hamburgers. So juicy and fresh tasting. Accept no other. 

Location: easy location next to Taco Y Taco. Parking in the lot can be challenging at high times. 

Service: Friendly and pleasant. This location is a good size and it's clean."}
{"text":"The burgers are great! 
Their meat is fresh, never frozen and you taste it!
A must for a fast lunch. 
You should be there before 12:00pm. 
Then it gets quite crowded ...

It's yummy but not cheap.
Burger, fries and a Coke: 11.10$"}
{"text":"Consistently good burgers, fries, and milkshakes. The employees are always friendly and helpful. It's nothing too special, just a slightly above average fast food burger shop but it's good in its own lane."}
{"text":"Got burnt chicken. When it was replaced it was burnt again and the worker (Amanda) said that she couldn't do anything about it except bring me a burger (honestly, if I'm getting chicken strips, it means I don't want a burger). My husband who works at a food place asked if the oil was dark and apparently the oil had not been filtered today leaving all the nasty burnt bits to cling to food. There was also an area that was super slippery from grease. The man cooking the food was also not wearing a facenet over his pretty long beard."}
{"text":"Came in today with my service dog in training and they were great! I ordered a Fido burger and they knew what I was talking about and even offered me a bowl of water for him. My dog tried to pick up the water bowl before it was empty and it dumped on the ground and Adrian was understanding and patient and even offered us another bowl of water. Love it when we have such wonderful experiences!"}
{"text":"Smash tots are good but didn't enjoy the bbq, bacon, and cheddar burger because it's overly salty. Atmosphere is good but the staff could have cleaned up tables better."}
{"text":"Staff were rude on both occasions.  Burger lacked flavor and substance.    2nd time eating at this location, and will not go back.  By far, Freddy's and 5 Guys have a better product for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This Smash Burger is not representative of the Smash Burger chain from what I've seen. I had a bacon avocado club with grilled chicken. The chicken was twice the size of the bun, so I had to trim he outsides off.  The only avocado looked like 1/5th of an avocado in one chunk right in the center. Hard to eat with it trying to jump out of the bun. Just overall disappointing in comparison to other locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Their burger is great! We go there all the time and we order different things off the menu and they are all great.  

Staff is friendly and helpful.  This is not fast food. I think I would call it casual dining. They are slower than In and Out but about the speed of 5 Guys.  Better than both IMHO."}
{"text":"Was there on 9/15/17 after 7pm.  5 stars for the food quality; 1 star for cleanliness. The walls are dirty, not like it just got dirty that day but dried up food on the walls kind of dirty.  The bathroom was filthy like you see in some old Circle K, if you know what I mean. The service was 3 atar.  The fries came out 5minutes before my burger. The quality of the food was great, but the dirty restaurant bothered me.   As i was leaving, i noticed an employee crouch down and tie his shoes before then continue working at the front. Yuck.  Hope to see it cleaned up next time I'm there spending over 20 bucks for 2 burgers and fries and a couple of drinks!"}
{"text":"Daughter and I went there on New Year's Day in the evening.  No wait.  Ordered at the deli-style counter.  Hard to choose as everything looked so good.  I went with the mushroom n swiss but added bleu cheese.  chose the fried onion rings as my side.  My daughter chose the bbq, bacon and cheddar I think with the smash fries.  They were pretty good but not as good as my onion rings.  the onion rings were super skinny and fried to perfection.  YUM.  The offered a good beer with it.  Service was good.  Size of food was good and price was great.  So for that, 5 stars and I WILL be going back!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a regular burger, fries and a chocolate shake.  The food was good but for $26 it was quite pricey for what you get.  The food was very comparable to what you would get at Steak N Shake, but twice the price.

We werent able to get a combo meal since we got shakes.  If the changed that policy it would make them more competitive."}
{"text":"Great service but just doesn't compete with 5 guys burgers. Felt a tad pricey for a under par burger. My wife enjoyed it but just don't think it was a hit for us."}
{"text":"I came in the other day and wasn't sure on what I wanted to eat because I recently stopped eating meat...originally I was thinking the sweet potato fries would be good, but wasn't gonna feel me up. Then all of a sudden I see the  Black Bean Burger, and noticed it was vegetarian. The customer service was great the store was Clean and even better the food was great. The Sweet Potato Fries Were Perfect And The Buger was amazing as well. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Place was filthy, \"manager\" basically threw our food on the table and then my chicken sandwich wasn't even what I ordered. Excuse was they are short staffed but you can tell it hadn't been clean in a while. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and quality.....don't understand because other locations Are FAR superior to this one."}
{"text":"Just now 
Long line to the door, one person at the counter. Totally under staffed at a peak time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger before the movie. Good choice, it was prepared very quickly and it was very tasty. I had the mushroom and swiss - plenty of very thin cut mushrooms and a slice of Swiss cheese on top of a thin grilled burger. The bun was perfect. My daughter chose the bacon and avocado. She also enjoyed it thoroughly.

The fries were a hit. Nice and thin shoestring fries, but not salty at all. Awesome. I put a hit of Cholula in with the ketchup and got a nice zing to them. Yum.

Two burgers, fries and two drinks for under $20? I'd do this again."}
{"text":"this place has some yummy tasting burgers!!! we've tried a few spots around town (5 guys, in & out, fatburger, johnny rockets, etc) but this might be one of the best burgers i've had in a long time... i created my own burger with pickles, lettuce, mustard, mayo, pepper jack cheese, and a fried egg on top! DELICIOUS!! the fries weren't too bad... my bf & i got out of there under $18 :) not bad.... we will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Love that they have gluten free burger buns!  I love the rosemary Smash fries!  This is one of our family favorites. The kids love the milkshakes too."}
{"text":"I love Smashburger, but this particular location is not run very well.  Vacuuming the floors 30 minutes before they close, under the table we're eating at????"}
{"text":"Service at this Smashburger is outstanding and the food is great.  I had some service issues with another location and I have to give kudos to the customer service team at Smashburger.  They really showed they cared.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This is only for Kristen--she is, I believe, the night manager and she does a terrific job.  A friend and I often drop in on Saturday after church and Kristen delivers customer service like non other.  I suspect she is challenged with turnover, \"kids\" not wanting to take direction etc; but she does her job with a smile and professional demeanor.  Suggest she be enpowered to do more...she's a keeper!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great. Shake was really watery tonight. And the kid's hotdog was terrible."}
{"text":"I keep returning here for my burger fix and I like it. Today tried the fried pickles which I really enjoyed. I still stay away from the fries but thats just me. The Avocado Club with an Egg bun has been my choice the last few visits. Today were were given a couple $2 coupons to ensure another visit, thanks!"}
{"text":"Sea Salt Fries and Sin City Burger

First, the fries with truffle mayo were very good. Crisp, not too oily, flavorful and they were piping hot. Also, the bacon on the burger was thick and not overcooked. 
Now, my problem was I ordered the burger itself to be cooked rare. The first try was well done. Realizing it may be a mistake I asked for a recook and was willing to pay for it. The second burger, at no cost, also was well done.  I gave up! This I could forgive if the burger wasn't so lacking in flavor. I was not expecting Kobe beef at $6.99 but the accompanying ingredients were bland including the sauce leading to an uninteresting burger with no taste, and the grilled onions were verging on barely cooked.
Overall, a major disappointment, especially when I wasn't expecting much to begin with."}
{"text":"What a waste of my money!  I can pan fry a burger at home and it will still taste much better that this place.  To think I spent almost $30 here, makes me angry...I want my money back.

My daughter got the Oreo shake which was really good.  But the burger was extremely disappointing.  Don't even get me started at how gross the veggie fries were....YUCK!"}
{"text":"Waited for ever, then watched a girl wipe her nose with her bare hands while also making my shake. So gross. When I finally got my food it was cold and my burger somehow had a different top bun that the bottom. Other locations are great but the staff here is awful"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but service could use some polishing up. I asked for some ranch when they brought our food but they never brought me any or said that they didn't have any."}
{"text":"I have been a total of 4 times now so i really feel i can give it a fair view. Its hardly crowded the few times i have been so good for me to not have to wait a long time. Employees are friendly enough. I joined the smashclub and took advantage of the buy one and get one burger. Great so i can have someone else try it. My daughter got the original smash and i got the one with the bacon and haystack onion rings. GREAT meaty burger, great taste and all...love the onion straws . Now the only mixed feeling i have is the prices of the burgers while very good $5.99 and up for a burger is a bit pricey especially when u have kids. Especially when In N Out can feed the whole family for about $12 and here u would be spending a WHOLE LOT more.

I enjoyed the burgers each time but this would be a special treat place and not an oh lets grab a burger for everyone place. But love the variety of the menu, veggie burgers, or chicken or salad. and even the chiptole bun. Love it just cant do it daily"}
{"text":"I love the menu at Smashburger because there are plenty of healthy options. And my wife loves that they offer a gluten free bun. Burgers are consistently good and the service is always great at this location. 
I have used Smash&Dash the last two times I was there. Order ahead on my phone, skip the line and then eat in or take it to go. Slick. Removing one star only because our order has been incorrect both times we used Smash&Dash."}
{"text":"When you walk in @ 9:15 and closing is 9:30 and you are invited to place an order to go and not sit down and eat........."}
{"text":"Ok listen to me on this one. I am old and therefore wise. I am fat and therefore my wisdom is concentrated in a few areas like food and related topics. Order the classic smash burger with blue cheese crumbled on it and a side of Buffalo sauce to drench your burger with. There was a party in my mouth and the cops were called twice. Oh. The restaurant is good too."}
{"text":"By far the rudest burger joint I've ever been to. I've had better service at burger King drive thru. Host K, this was our First and Last time at this establishment. I felt like I was an inconvenience and was being rushed while trying to order. Keep in my this was my family's 1st time. Please don't tap you nails or sigh deeply when people are right in front of you. It's rude!"}
{"text":"**military discount**- Regular size fountain drink for free! 
Mmmm...yes....I loves me some Smashburger.  Went here yesterday 6-28-15 around 12:30 PM.  I ordered a small burger with cheddar cheese, pickles, mustard, and ketcup on an egg bun with a small order of fries with a drink ($6.03 was the total).  Delish!!!  
The cashier and food runner were friendly."}
{"text":"For some reason I feel like Smashburger is healthy (newsflash: it ain't) so when I'm craving a burger but also want to feel dainty and waifish I always head to Smashburger.  

Visited on Tuesday 8-23-16 around 6PM. $26.32 got us a kids grilled chicken meal, a milkshake, a chicken sandwich with fries, and a cobb salad.  

Yes, I had a salad and a milkshake.  Don't you judge me.  I see you over there with your judge-y looks.  

$7.99 classic cobb salad - Menu says it has fresh greens, a fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, onions, cheddar and blue cheese topped with buttermilk ranch dressing.  I asked for no blue cheese and chose crispy chicken to go on top.  

When my salad arrived I was a bit perplexed....there was a big scrambled egg sitting on top next to the chicken.  The menu says it's supposed to be fried and I guess they broke the yolk and just said \"fuck it\" and threw it on my salad.  I never thought I would say I have eaten scrambled eggs on salad but...there ya go.  Those are the cards I was dealt.  I didn't say anything to the staff about it...I just sat there and ate my weird-ass salad.  Their ranch dressing is gross...tastes like hidden valley.  They use spring mix lettuce and the chicken was perfectly cooked...moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  

We split a $4.29 chocolate banana milkshake and it was perfect.  I like how they serve the milkshake in a glass and give you the leftovers from the metal mixer container.  It makes it really easy to split between two people. 

 My husband got \"veggie frites\" instead of fries and they were delicious and next time I go back I'm going to just get a basket of those and not share with anybody.  They were green beans and carrots shaped like fries and sauteed to perfection.  They taste almost exactly like green beans from a cheap chinese buffet, which I love.    

So from now on Imma stick to burgers here because they are delicious.  That's what I get for ordering a salad at a burger place."}
{"text":"This business needs to get it together. Lunch rush is horrible today, way under staffed. They have the register lady taking orders and running the food. They have 2 registers left empty as she runs all the food, with a huge line not being taken care of. Do not come here on lunch time unless you have time to spare and want to wait in line for awhile. These people are great people when they show up for work, lol! Register lady said 2 people didn't show today. But she was great and still had a smile on her face

Food has always been acceptable here. Good location for a burger joint, great solid burgers with anything you would want. I showed up on a bad day for them. I'll give them benefit of the doubt cause they are usually on point."}
{"text":"There are no shortage of bad things you can say about smash burger but at this location the food was good and the service was really dang good. The nerdy looking guy with the glasses is a hard worker and made the trip pleasant and even bussed the table for us. He even tolerated the people in my group  and their annoying use of multiple coupons. Good times!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places when it comes to taste. This location did not disappoint! Both of our burgers were extremely juicy & our fries came out piping hot! Our CSR Will was also very helpful with decision making.  Definitely will return...on my next Cheat Day"}
{"text":"Ehh. The milkshakes & service was great, but the food was average. & it's really cold inside"}
{"text":"If you have time... Save your self the waste of money and Go to the one on 24th street and Baseline. This one is horrible... the fries flavorless and stale, I ordered grilled chicken on my sandwich it was burned and it tasted bitter, the tomatoes were small and looked old like they had been sitting for a while. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Yesterday ordered to go from this smashburger restaurant and when we got home we had someone else's order, nothing that we ordered.  My husband took it back to them and they wanted to give him the bag that was supposed to be ours but was cold, the fries were cold and the burgers and the milk shake melting.  He asked them to make a new order and they did but they gave us raw hamburgers.  The inside was pure red."}
{"text":"Great veggie burger and the Heineken buckets are reasonably priced.

Good smash for your bucks!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  My favorite is the Baja burger!!
Haven't tried the shakes yet. Sweet potato fries and Harvest Salad are good, too."}
{"text":"Visited here tonight for the first time.  Honestly, I was SHOCKED at how good it was!  The Deluxe Burger had a fresh delicious beef flavor you rarely get anywhere let alone in a \"fast food\" type of place. Pickles, tomato, lettuce, etc were crisp and fresh. The Smash fries were amazing and came in a huge pile.  I read the reviews before I tried the Smash.  Maybe they improved, I don't know.  All I can say is that this is now my go-to burger spot instead of IN N Out when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place before so decided to give it a try. Tried the BBQ Bacon SmashBurger. It was delicious. Yummy fries! If we ever see another one in our travels we will definitely stop and eat. You've got to try it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Burgers are always good and love the Oreo shakes!!! The nutter butter is good too! The special sauce is so good and also love the fried pickles!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I'd never been here before, but was lucky enough to get a free meal thanks to a Yelp event. I got the bacon burger sans bun to make it more gluten free friendly (just remember to have the onion thingys removed too since they're breaded). Also got the smash fries, which are rosemary and olive oil, which are the best fries ever! Overall, I thought the whole experience was great. Staff was attentive and friendly, the burger was really flavorful and it was a really clean and inviting atmosphere. 

We tried the butterfinger shake, which I wasn't a huge fan of, just because the texture had a weird fluffy thing going on. I like my shakes thick, so this is just a me thing. 

I'll be back for sure since it's right up the street for me. Great job Smashburger!"}
{"text":"OMG, great burgers! I fell onto this place, after shopping in the mall area.  I ordered the Phoenix and my daughter the Portabello Mushroom. Both were delicious, although I favored mine (with the jalapenos). Didn't care for the skinny fries with sea salt, as they had very little flavor and were dried out."}
{"text":"Good enough food, but really nothing to write home about.  Service - they weren't rude, but they weren't very friendly either.  Just kinda there taking your money.  I had the Triple Double and Smash Fries.  The burger was at an introductory price and my order was still a little pricey for a very, very average burger and fries.  Meh."}
{"text":"Today was one of the worst experiences at any restaurant I have been to. The place was disgusting and not clean. There was food all over the ground. Tables were not clean or even cleared off. We were lucky to find 1 table clean but was in direct sunlight. So we decided to move to another spot and clean the table off ourselves. When we got our food my boyfriends burger was burnt and also very salty. We also got there spicy buffalo fries. Do not recommend getting them. Way to salty and clumps of seasoning. We did get 2 milk shakes. Mint oreo and strawberry. Well this is a whole another story. Strawberry tasted like syrup and was way to runny. Then the mint oreo well in there picture it is green. Mine was grey with a slight green tint  i said something to the girl and she said there was plenty of mint in it and there shakes never look like the picture. Well maybe you should change that. So I decided not to even bother and leave. I was beyond grossed out being inside there. Even when we walked out people were making comments how horrible it was in there. By the time i got to my car my shake was separating and so runny. The only plus was the bathroom was clean. But this does not even deserve 1 star. And to top it all off we both got sick from the food we ate. We will not be returning to this location again"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times since I moved here. Always good customer service & great food. Was there earlier today & the young man in the red shirt who took my order was very friendly & had great customer service skills. I was really impressed because you Nora lily don't see that at fast food places. The whole staff is usually polite but I had to write this review just based on this past experience and give him & them the respect they deserve."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Smashburger, but it's not the best burger I've ever had or will have for that matter. It is definitely a huge step above In & Out and about as good as it gets for \"fast food.\" The Smash fries are absolutely fantastic! Little crunchy gems tossed in rosemary, olive oil, and garlic. I am pretty sure I could eat a barrel of them by myself. The burgers aren't bad either. I tend to favor the mushroom and swiss burger. My husband opts for the BBQ, bacon, and cheddar with a chipotle bun, just the right amount of spicy and savory. 

We have also tried the sweet potato fries and the haystack onions, both of them are OK but nothing special. I have also indulged in the fried pickles, which are overly salty to the point where they are almost inedible. However, if we are talking flavor then this is one of the best, if not the best, fast food burger and fries out there."}
{"text":"My husband went to smash burger today for lunch. We ate in today instead of getting our food to go. The service was super friendly and nice. We both got a classic smash burger and split some fries and got a side of smash sauce.. (Which is awesome by the way) the burgers were super good, even better than our first visit. This might be our new favorite burger place"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience for burgers I've ever had. Drowning in grease, not only was my bun soggy but the grease from the \"smash fries\" started to soak into my table. The only saving grease 'grace' was your staff was on point with serving and highly courteous. That's why ill just stick to rocket burger as my go to. Or in n out but definitely never this again."}
{"text":"What I liked: sweet soft buns, fried eggs on burgers, real chicken tenders, Vitamin Water & Honest Tea on tap, shoestring onions. My kid said he liked the chicken tenders better than McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. Not that McNuggets are the standard, but I'm glad I didn't have a problem getting him to finish his food."}
{"text":"Like their burgers but the service is really bad and can't keep the place clean. Dirty tables and staff walking around and I am wondering why they don't bus the tables."}
{"text":"This place is OK. I love their burgers and I like how many toppings and combos they have.
However, I was a little annoyed the last time I went here because I asked for my arizona burger as a salad and it came on a plate with 1 leaf of lettuce and barely any guacamole. I went back and said I'd be happy to pay for a bowl of lettuce, and instead I got a tiny side tray of greens. 
My burger was still pretty good, but I was annoyed that I wasn't able to get what I'd asked for. How hard is it to have a \"burger in a bowl\" option? And you'd think with all the gluten-free/low-carb customers smash burger must have that they would make this option convenient and appealing to their customers, instead of just plopping meat patties onto plates."}
{"text":"Give this location another shot. It is Under New Management. With new staff.  I live right on the corner so I come here all the time. The difference is incredible. The new manager (Tony) has really whipped this place into shape and you can certainly tell. The food is better the orders are more accurate.  Friendly staff and they finally fired the old manager who I swear was drinking on the job

 I'm really surprised such excellent Burgers get such poor reviews. Give them another shot you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just ok burgers! Great pricing for being in LA live! Would suggest for a quick and easy meal, but not for a \"big juicy burger\" craving. I do enjoy the outdoor seating they have and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Went in and before I ordered the employee at the register said they were only doing to go orders because they were getting ready to close. I ordered and waited maybe 3 minutes and my food was ready??? As I was leaving I noticed the cook who just placed my order in the window had an unlit cigarette tucked into his ear which raised my curiosity about cleanliness. After I got to my hotel room which was only a couple blocks away at the Bluegreen Resort, the bag was so totally soaked with oil which has now made a mess on the counter. When removing the contents from the bag, all the napkins that had been placed into the bag were soaked with oil as well. The burger was soaked, the fries were soaked and ice cold as well as the damn ketchup packs leading me to believe that the fries had been sitting out for awhile already (remember, my order only took 3 minutes to prepare???). It was so disgusting I had to throw it out! Stay away from this place, the food will make you sick just looking at it!"}
{"text":"Yes there are so many burger joints but this place DOES IT RIGHT.

A huge burger, with a cool vibe and local brews hit the spot.  
I ordered the Arizona Smash Burger and it had so much flavor...Habenero cheese and guac for dayyyys.   I got the big one...which is a $7 burger, kinda pricy so that's why I settled on the 4 stars.  

Everything was great including the entertaining and receptive staff.  A good place to munch when hungry as a hippo."}
{"text":"Have been hearing about Smashburger for months (none in Los Angeles yet to my knowledge) and finally had an opportunity while in Vegas to try it.  

I was told that their chicken was sublime. So with that, I ordered the :

SPICY BAJA (6.99)
Pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and fresh jalapeños on a spicy chipotle bun

And a side of the:

SMASHFRIES (1.99)
Tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.

The sandwich or chicken burger I suppose was Excellent!  Loved the boldness of it and the flavor combination too.  Not to mention the tasty succulent chicken.  I would have to order this again I think.

And next time for a side either the:

SWEET POTATO FRIES (2.29)
Seasoned with sea salt.

HAYSTACK ONIONS (1.99)
Served with dipping sauce.

Or the 

FRIED PICKLES (2.29)
Served with buttermilk ranch dressing.

Bring on the Smashburgers Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this Smashburger location.  It is in my neighborhood which I am grateful for because we don't have many options in the area I live in.  However, the cleanliness of the restaurant, quality of food, quality of employees, sanitation of the employees is highly questionable !!
If I am extremely descriptive of what I want or how I expect my food to be served they meet my requirements - if I don't the food is inferior.
I have actually met with the district manager who was very nice but I feel our meeting was in vein because I have not seen the improvements I was assured I would.
BTW - the employees repeatedly neglect to turn on the neon \"Open\" sign so people driving by can see they are open.  I think they do that so customers think they are closed so they do not have to work.
I also had an employee tell me his food handler card was expired but yet he was still working ??
Get it together Power Road, Mesa AZ Smashburger - we need you !!"}
{"text":"I first tried this place because I got a groupon for it, and boy was I glad I did! This is a great burger place. The caramel malt was superb and the ingredients they use for their food are soooo fresh. Great, friendly service. I will definitely be coming here again and again."}
{"text":"The staff is horrible!!!!! While ordering the gentleman taking orders was more focused on conversations being had elsewhere because I had to repeat and correct my order several times. Then, when he turned back to the boys behind the fryers to tell them to add 3 chicken strip meals to the fryer the little boy back there rolled his eyes in obvious annoyance and said \"it's gonna be awhile\"... I spent $42 on two burgers that were barely edible because of the grease. I'm sad to say that I won't be back to this location again. I can't expect much from a restaurant staffed by immature high school kids."}
{"text":"Yummy! I visited the Smashburger in Tempe for the first time last week, and it's delicious! Due to it's proximity to ASU, they offer a student discount which includes a classic smashburger, smashfries and a drink for $7.50. The classic smashburger comes with the regular crowd- lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, lettuce and tomatos. But this ain't your momma's burger, it's huge and delicious!! And the smashfries are made with rosemary and garlic and are completely addicting! If you're in the mood for a burger, but want to try something new, you have to check out Smashburger! They're popping up all over the valley- so chances are, there's one in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been here twice. I am ok w the vegetarian (not vegan) offerings. The price point is totally fine. The location...it's Stonecrest. It's going to be crowded on the weekend especially since Smashburger is right by the fun outdoor seating area. The restaurant can get very noisy when almost at capacity. Table turnaround time isn't bad. The last time I went when we opened the door we were the end of the line. In 13 minutes we were placing our order with a calm, cool, and collected cashier and by the time we filled our drink cups a table had opened up. On both trips here the food was delivered within 10 minutes. Overall not bad.

Here's why I do not plan on going back: my little dude ordered a (different) burger each time and 20 minutes after we left the place his stomach went crazy wonky*. 

*This is my vague way of saying he blew up the bathroom."}
{"text":"Kind of over priced but their food as always been good to me. I just like how I can get my burger exactly the way I want it. Someyimes the wait is a little bit ridiculous the at least the food it good"}
{"text":"Best burger in town.  Smash fries are delicious.  Have never been disappointed with quality or service.  #smashingisbetter"}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better. First time eating here so I thought I would give it a try.  But next time I will stick with Islands Burgers.  Way better value."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for chain restaurants, but after my wonderful first time visit to Smashburger I just had to!

Upon arrival to Smashburger, we were greeted by the smiling face of the cashier.  She gladly explained the menu and made her personal suggestions to us.  The inside décor is very simple but I was surprised that the place was very well-kept.  Tables were all aligned, clean, and there wasn't a spot on the floor!  

For my order, I had the truffle mushroom swiss burger ($5.99) and the smash fries ($1.99). On my burger, I added the complimentary toppings: grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles.  After the first bite of my burger, I knew I was hooked!  It had a certain burst of flavor that I couldn't pinpoint to one ingredient.  The components of the burger really worked well together and the seasoning was right on!  The smash fries were also very delicious.  In addition, a server was walking around to all the parties to make sure that everyone was doing okay.  A step above your typical burger chain restaurant.  Will be coming back again (and again)!"}
{"text":"A little too pricey for decent burgers. We had  the baja and the carolina. Nothing stands out about it. Around $16/person with drink. I like Burger 21 more."}
{"text":"I don't like this branch, we've been there twice since this location is closer to our house. Their burgers are not really \"smashed\" and they don't take instructions rightfully. We had ordered the bacon in the burger to be crispy and burnt.No it wasnt. We instructed to set the crispy fried onions aside.They put them together in the bun. 

I still like the Rural/Baseline location better.Sweet potato fries are suggested.Our last visit I tried one of their salads, it was really good!

And...I really initially picked 2 stars but because for the numerous times we've visited Rural and Marketplace locations they give me free smash side for taking the phone survey, hence,they deserve the 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I just happened to notice this Smashburger the other day after I was dropping off some friends....We had been trailrunning and I was hungry.  The manager waited on me and she was very friendly and professional.  I ordered their Sin City (personally I find that general term as degrading as a Las Vegas local) and I really was not all that impressed.  Not bad but not my cup of tea.  I had the sea salt fries but they did not really rock my world either.  Nothing bad to say but I would probably stay with Five Guys and In-And-Out for my burger fix."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burger place, i'd skip the veggie burger cause it just very bland. They do a regional burger for every location. I was in Vegas, so I had the SIN CITY. This burger has Fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun. It was really tasty and the service was really great!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time last night and the food was so delicious. I got a classic with cheddar and avocado and my husband got their BBQ burger. I'm surprised other reviewers say they received poor service because the girls were all so nice! We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and an affordable place to have dinner with the family. However, they got 3 out of 4 orders wrong (one was even a Build-Your-Own Burger) and were out of ranch. Regardless, the burger was cooked medium and the smash fries were seasoned well. I would recommend ordering online and then picking up to ensure the right order."}
{"text":"We did a burger challenge with Lydia, Cheryl, Nelly, Debbie and myself while visiting Vegas. We decided to do it on with Five Guys Burger, Fat Burger and Smash Burger. Here are the results of the following:

Score are 1-10 and 10 being the highest

- Five Guys 5 to 6 it was lacking seasoning/flavor/fat, bun was very basic, all you can eat peanuts was unexpected but good! Clean bright dining room. $$$$

- Fat Burger 7 it was juicy, seasoned very well, bun was a upgraded Kaiser style, fat fries cooked to order. Foul sewage odor / dark in the dining room.$$$

- Smash Burger 9.5 WON it was the tastiest, just enough meat, fat and seasoning, best atmosphere in the stylish dining room, the bun was the best egg style bun. Most inexpensive.$$

Congratulations Smash Burger for being the top dog! Congrats to my burger foodies for hanging in on the 110 degrees heat while taking on this Challenge!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm updating a review from 2011 where I had a chicken salad with only 3 pieces of chicken in it. 

My friend wanted to go here so I said, why not...maybe its changed. Well, I upgraded one star because the All-American burger I got tasted good ($4.99) for a medium. My friend had a small bacon cheeseburger ($5.69). One soda and one salted caramel milkshake for a total of $17 and change. So for me, this is still overpriced. I can get a double-double for less and it tastes better. So 4 years after my last visit, and will probably be another 4 years until I try it again. I just don't find it a good value, similar to 5 guys. I was still semi hungry after the medium burger."}
{"text":"This burger joint is located in a strip mall type area, next to a nail salon on the corner. Parking is okay, not too busy.

The interior is brightly lit with plenty of seating; the menu is clear (what comes on burgers, etc.) & the customer service is okay (nothing extraordinary).

As much as I wanted to absolutely love the food & had high expectations of it, it wasn't all that awesome. It was like any other burger joint but less greasy, other than the shake. I got the butterfinger shake & it was AMAZING!

If I'm in the area, I'd probably return; it was good enough food & not going to lie, I'd be back mainly for the shake... Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Allow me to say one thing, my wife and I got food poisoning from here. We ran into the couple that ordered before us at CVS buying alkaline water and OTC med's because they got sick from the food as well. Please, enjoy your time in Vegas. Value your life and health, don't eat here!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly on a take-order. My parents ate in and called up to see if I would like something to eat since I busy unpacking... I said, \"Sure that sounds great, I had just bookmarked this establishment out for a try. Surprise me with the burger.\"

So when Snoopy and Ebu -- our nicknames for our parents - show up with sustenance, you can bet I was ready to dig my teeth into some yum yums. They delivered the Spicy Baja - which is pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, red onion, spicy chipotle may and fresh jalpenos on a spicy chipotle bun. 

It was pretty darn good! Snoopy remembered to order my ranch - don't really care for mayo (unless mum makes it) so I use a bit-o-ranch. I probably wouldn't order this one again, but I would order something else. The meat was of good quality, the produce fresh and not wilted, the guacamole was a bit runny for my standards (being from Cali--you know what REAL guac should taste like) and the bun was fabulous. The problem with take-out is that being the bun was soooo friggin fresh... it got a bit soggy as it soaked up all the burgers yumminess. 

So on my next review of Smash, I will be sure to eat in and enjoy the ambiance! To soak it all in.... But for now, I'm sold."}
{"text":"Big disappointment!  Have been there a few times and the service has been horrible.  I actually took a survey with corporate and the franchise owner called me and promised to make it right by sending some coupons.  He never sent them which just underscored to me how bad the service is at Smashburger."}
{"text":"This place does an okay job on burgers. The name says it all which not sure why they actually smash the burgers because all that does is push all the juice out of the meat and as expected it is on the dry side. Plus they will not cook your burger to temperature which indicates they do not trust their own beef which is a problem in itself. French fries were tasty and they have some interesting side sauces. All in all it's a decent place but nothing special. Many other places to go in the same price range for a much better Burger. The restaurant itself was clean, the employees were at helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"They do a good job on their burgers the only thing I do not like is that they actually do smash the burgers with a spatula and I feel that releases the juice and drys them out a bit. They do have excellent skinny fries and the service is fast and friendly. The restaurant itself is clean and well maintained."}

{"text":"Save three bucks and get the same burger at wendys...then get your fries at five guys since they cost two bucks at smash burger.  Overpriced average at best"}
{"text":"We've been to Smashburger many times.  I usually get the Classic Smashburger with all the fixings.  My kids get the Classics, too.  They also like their regular fries whereas I prefer their Smashfries.  We love their Haagen Daz shakes.  As my teen son would say, they make them creamy and smooth.

They are a bit more expensive but I don't see why people are complaining about the price.  Do they want McD or BK prices? Come on!!  Their burgers are definitely more juicy and tasty than the mass-produced burger chains out there. Considering the choices of burgers in the Highland Heights/Cold Spring area they would still be the best in this community.  Their competition is a bit of short drive away in Newport(5Guys and Mad Mike's) thus we will definitely keep coming back for their delicious burgers."}
{"text":"Meh.  It was friendly service and a clean restaurant, but I didn't think there was anything special about their burgers...other than that they were extra greasy.  I like the build-your-own concept, but I wasn't impressed when my burger came out. I ordered it with goat cheese, grilled onions, and Smash sauce and it was skimpy on all three.  I honestly don't even think they put goat cheese on it.  The Smash tots were pretty good, but also greasy.  It was okay, but there are other burger places nearby thatI like better.  And as for the build-your-own chains, I like 5 Guys better because I can get Frank's hot sauce on my burger.  Probably won't come here again. Not horrible, but not memorable."}
{"text":"Good yummy fresh burgers to your ordering choice. free dry peanuts all you can eat, lol. if you order fries, they give a lot to share with your party, too much to eat by yourself."}
{"text":"I like smashburger enough because of how they cook their patties. Definitely an alternative to the prerprocessed and packaged patties found at other fast food joints.

My favorite item on the menu is the sweet potato fries... delicious! The standard smashburger is great in my book, but I wasn't too thrilled with the smashchicken sandwich. A little bland, nothing out of the ordinary, no particular kick or taste to separate it from the rest of the pack.

Customer service = beyond excellent!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint. Reasonably priced. Got the mushroom and swiss burger and it literally melted in my mouth and down to my tummy. SOOO GOOD. The patty was so moisted. Definitely not your typical fast food place. Get \"Smash fries\" if you like them seasoned."}
{"text":"We have gone to Smashburger 2 times now and LOVE it!  Hannah has been the cashier both times and always has a smile and goes out of her way to make sure the food for my 2 medically gluten free kids is made properly.  The flavor is the best around.  I have had the truffle mushroom burger (yum!) and the chicken, avocado sandwich (yum!).  I highly recommend, esp for my GF friends!"}
{"text":"First off I would like to say, I have been a customer to his location since it opened. I have brought members of our youth group and church numerous of times. We have always received exceptional business. This is why I'm giving it two stars. Last night, our group showed up at 9:30pm. We received the dirty looks from all the employees, including the manager Cynthia. As I was giving my order, the lady at the register kept shaking her head with disgust and frustration. When she brought our food out she just kinda tossed in on our table. My brother proceeded to the cooks, and let them know we appreciate them taking care of us tonight. My brother then told Cynthia the same thing but told her, the other lady cannot be doing that to customers. We had a couple more of our group coming but couldn't come in because they locked the doors at 9:47pm. (I thought they closed at 10pm). As we were exiting, we happened to look back to see one of the cooks giving us the middle finger. My sister asked Cynthia to open the front door, to let her know. She wasn't even surprised!! I've had a lot of bad service in the past but this is the worst I've ever had. 

I would like to add something very positive here. After going directly to Smashburgers website I was immediately contacted by the district manager. He was very apologetic. He need make any excuses and took full accountability, even though it was his fault at all. The two employees that treated us horribly were terminated. I will be going back to all smashburger to show us, they are a great company that's prides in customer service!! Thank you Smashburger for carrying!"}
{"text":"Q:  Is there a way to make a hamburger do the Hula? 
A:  Sure, order a burger and a shake!

After hearing so much about Smashburger, I really wanted to love them.  For $25.77, we got the Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger with a side of Smashfries, the Avocado Club with Veggie Frites, and a Salted Caramel Shake.  Here are my thoughts:

\"TRUFFLE MUSHROOM SWISS: With sautéed crimini mushrooms & truffle mayo on an egg bun.\"  Minus the strong mushroom taste, it was an otherwise bland burger.  It was cooked well-done and was super greasy.  My mouth was coated in oil the whole time I ate my burger and it just wasn't enjoyable.

\"AVOCADO CLUB: With applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, ranch dressing & mayo on a multi-grain bun.\"  The Avocado Club was much better than the Truffle Mushroom Swiss. Fresh avocados, perfectly cooked applewood bacon, and dressed nicely.  It was also cooked well-done and still had a greasy feel.  At least it had more flavor.

\"SMASHFRIES®: Tossed in Italian olive oil, rosemary & garlic.\"  These are amazing.  I could eat these fries by the dozen.  They were super flavorful but the thing that made me salty was how skinny they are.  I'm the kind of eater that likes to eat fries one by one but I found myself chomping on these by threes.

\"VEGGIE FRITES: With a side of ranch dressing\"  I was disappointed in these.  These were just oily roasted green beans and carrots.

SALTED CARAMEL MILKSHAKE: Delicious!  Not too sweet, not too salty, just perfect.  I wish I saw that they actually served maltshakes too because I love malts over milkshakes.

All in all, it was a decent dinner.  The place could use some cleaning since I saw grease all over the table and the booths but hey, maybe they were busy before I walked in and they hadn't had a chance to clean yet [although it was slow by 7PM and the staff mainly stood around].  But with all these other great local burger places charging the same amount in prices, I'm not sure I'd ever crave Smashburger specifically."}
{"text":"customer service is so great here! Food is good, went here twice on our vacation to las vegas. brought a few people with me and they loved it as well. suprised the staff walked around asking customers if they needed anything. they also refilled our drinks. didnt expect that from a fast place. a must go to if you love burgers and great staff!"}
{"text":"Don't know how I feel about smashburger. The fact you can order online & have it ready by a certain time is awesome and super convenient. Now food wise... I had heard a lot of mixed reviews from people. You either hate it or love it basically. I got the Sin City burger & the smash fries. The bun was super soft and it melts in your mouth. As far as the rest of the burger, it didn't really wow me. The smash fries were the best part of my meal! Also a little on the pricey side. I might try something else next time, but as far as burgers are concerned, I'll probably stick with In n Out or Five Guys."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time the other day and ordered a Sin City burger and Smash Fries.  The fries were good... cooked perfectly and the seasoning they used (rosemary and garlic) was a different twist from the normal salt.  But I'd prefer good old salt in the long run.  The burger tasted good and had quality ingredients, but it was nothing special or out of the norm.  Next time I'm craving a burger, I'll probably end up at In-N-Out or Fudrucker's instead and probably wouldn't make a special trip to go here.  Also, the burger was pretty freakin' greasy.  Half way through eating it, I took a break to wash my hands.... yeah I got them greasy all over again, but it was that bad. I do like that they have some kind of unique items on the menu (veggies frites, sweet potato fries, fried pickles).  You can switch out chicken instead of hamburger on a number of the burgers. A fountain drink, burger, and fries cost me just over $10.00, which I think is a pretty good value for a quality burger.  They also have a small alcohol selection... bottled beer (the only brands I specifically remember are PBR and Blue Moon) and small bottled wine.  So even though my first encounter was nothing special, I'll likely return and try out some other menu items."}
{"text":"We were here for a Yelp even and I have to say that I was impressed. I know that the staff and management will be on their best behavior during these events (after all they are basically a form of marketing) but still. This was the best service I've had at any Yelp event. Including some fine dining establishments.

The district managers (former owners before they went corporate) really seem proud of their work and their locations. The staff knew their stuff and they do temp their meat rather than rely entirely on a timer (which means that it is possible to get something that is not as overdone as most fast food locations).

The food all tasted great and there is a huge variety including interesting looking salads. And don't forget about the hidden menu items including... friend pickles.

In my opinion, this is one of my favorite fast casual places in the valley. I'd place them above 5 Guys and In And Out. And the prices seemed a touch lower than 5 Guys and you can get something from 4 Peaks if you want a drink too."}
{"text":"I think I must be in the minority here, but I just didn't like Smashburger much at all. The service was speedy and there was no problem, the restaurant itself was clean and well designed. 

However, The food really left a lot to be desired. The shake I got was pretty good, but the fries tasted like they had been cooked in oil that hadn't been changed in weeks. My burger itself was somewhat dry and rather tasteless, I couldn't finish it.

Perhaps it was just an off day or perhaps their burgers just aren't that good if you don't load up on toppings. I may try it again, but I won't be going out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Burgers are tastey! Don't bother with the Smash Fries. The concept is nice, but tossing something that's already been fried in olive oil is to much!"}
{"text":"This store seems to always be out of their shakes, either the ingredients or the machine is down, something seems to always be wrong. Their burgers are good, even though the mushrooms are canned and not fresh. The smash fries I love. However I do come here for the shakes and without one my meal feels incomplete. This is the closest smashburger to our house and still 25 minutes away. I've even called to make sure their machine was working and arrived to their power being out. Needless to say we left as they weren't able to make us a shake or food. Last time I came here they had taken the butterfinger shake of the menu, which was my all time favorite. I will not return."}
{"text":"ok so after 3 trips here i finally figured out why the burgers are so over salty. first they said try cheddar instead of american cheese but that didn't help. Apparently they add some salted butter stuff(not real butter  ) to the buns. Then they add tons of salt and better and another salty meat flavoring to give the common ground beef a more steak taste. Now that I know this, I order no salt, no seasoning s etc. Next time you eat a SB burger  realize you're eating a weeks worth of sodium in every bite"}
{"text":"I love this place. Ever since I found out that there was one of these close by I have been going a couple times a week. I really like the classic smash and the regular fries, but, I also like the mushroom Burger and the BBQ. Try a large burger with truffle mayo, haystack onions and American cheese. That was my creation from last week and my new favorite. The milkshakes are also very good (salted caramel is  awesome) and the staff have been really great. You will spend just as much at Subway and in my opinion Smashburger is the better deal. It's just an all around great place to eat"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing. Consistently tasty. 

Best thing in the house? The Arizona burger. Fresh guacamole, fresh jalapenos and the most amazing chipotle sauce I've ever had on a burger.

Do you want a good burger? Come here. No place better in Phoneix."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not a gourmet burger, and definitely overpriced. The bun was fine, but nothing special, and the patty was fresh and clearly of decent quality (ground chuck, perhaps?) but less than a quarter pound, and under-seasoned. The big disappointment for me was the \"fried\" onions (this was their \"Calgary\" burger), which were definitely more stewed than fried, and dripped all over, making the bun soggy. At $5 it wouldn't be bad value - and would take them to three stars, but at $8? Afraid not.

The place is clean, and the service is fast, but with the prices (everything is a la carte), I can't recommend it."}
{"text":"I love their chicken sandwich. I don't eat red meat so I haven't tried the burgers but the chicken, fries, and shakes are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Solid burgers - I think they take a ball of fresh (not frozen) ground beef and smash it into the griddle, hence the name. They also do chicken sandwiches, grilled cheese, shakes, and fries and onion strings.  The onion strings and fries are light and thin, crispy and great for dipping into the killer sauce they serve.

This time 'round I got the Baja burger - jalepenos, pepper jack cheese, and guacamole for a good kick, I've also had the Avocado club burger (bacon and avocado with ranch) - both very good burgers. Staff was nice - came around and cleared our plates.  You can get better burgers, but this is way better and fresher than your typical fast food fare."}
{"text":"Smashburger is amazing!  The Arizona burger definitely satisfies my burger needs, and the smashfries are incredible.  

My wife complains about going to burger places usually and was hesitant to try Smashburger, but once she went, she fell in love with it."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The food was great but the people and atmosphere really made the experience. I loved the burger I ordered and the onion strings! Everything was simple but delicious! Definitely a fun, casual place for burgers and more with very nice people and great service!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great tasting burgers.   Asked for mine to be cooked medium versus med well and it was perfect! All condiments fresh,  well prepared."}
{"text":"Do you sometimes just want a simple BBQ bacon cheeseburger drenched in BBQ sauce? You can't get it at in n out because they don't sell it, and you can't head to Bachi, because it wouldn't be the simple 'ole burger you're craving. 

BBQ bacon cheese smash to the rescue!!!!!! I wanted bacon. With cheese. And it had to be BBQ. So I finally came here after looking at multiple burger reviews and their menus. Trust...took me about an hour. 

Not too bad at all. I give them way more kudos than shake shack because 1) I feel like I'm getting what I paid for at $6,50 for the burger. It ain't cheap but it ain't too crazy pricey. Price point is well set for the quality and what they're selling. 2) Shakes are made using Haagen Daz ice cream. Yeah, I don't get paying $5 or more for custard shakes. 

This is the step up from Carl's junior and In n Out, but one step below the upper echelons like Bachi, Umami, and Stout. 

Fries were shoestring but tasted okay. Mine were cold for some odd reason. 
Service here isn't too great. I spilled soda all over my fries (thankfully after I ate a few and decided I didn't care for it) and the table and the floor, and saw 2 kitchen staff walking towards me while I was in their line of view. These guys didn't even flag the host, cashier, or the other workers to clean it up. They didn't offer to bring a mop out either. I jut ended up cleaning the mess myself which was no biggie, but I swirl sucky expected they would notify the other staff after seeing what happened. 

My super quick motor skills kicked in quick enough to save what was left of my burger from drowning in the sea of soda. 

It was the perfect burger for what I wanted during my craving strike. Will be back but skipping the fries and maybe I'll try their shakes or the onion rings."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I've been here and both were great experiences. Customer service was fantastic, the staff seems to like their jobs and the burger was great. My only complaint is the Cobb salad was pretty plain, meaning there were a few ingredients on it but small amounts. Otherwise, this place was.pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"I just came in for lunch. 
DON'T order the triple double burger!
It was so greasy I left more than half of it on the tray. The haystack onions were no better.
 Come on, I've had deep fried burgers and Blooming onions with half the grease!! 
I feel I just waisted 11 bucks and left hungry.
I may not come back here. What a change from last time."}
{"text":"Fast friendly staff was not very busy didn't have to wait long for order BBQ bacon cheeseburger was very good fries were a little tough maybe had sat a little to long. It's not the best burger in town but it's still pretty good!!"}
{"text":"Best fast food burger we have ever had.  Tastes better than a delicious restaurant burger.  We have been back three times in two weeks and we live in Maricopa, a half an hour away!  Get the chili fries, YUM!"}
{"text":"We love smashburger. That being said, if this were our first visit to a smashburger we would never go back. I had to ask for hot sauce two times and never got it. We ordered two burgers and they came out, one wrong. We told them and they took it back. What we did get (mine) had the wrong fries and they were so greasy that they were gross. Twenty minutes later we asked again and they said \"oops sorry we will make it now\". Got it about 15 minutes later. By then I was long done my meal. They said \"sorry here is a free coupon to make up for it\" and it was a buy an entree get a free side coupon. Wow. No one seemed to care about anything there. We won't be back even though it is the closest one to us."}
{"text":"The classic burger is one of best burgers I've ever had on the fast food spectrum. Their smashfries were awesome and those haystack onion ringlettes were stellar! Definitely hitting this place up whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Customer service is blah. Not too appreciative of their customers. Fake attitude, managers a tool. His man bun an wrist jewelry is a \"tell\""}
{"text":"Went in, got our order to go & when we got back to eat, the order was wrong. This place is great supposedly but I'm allergic to the cheese on hamburgers & so I couldn't eat what I had (specifically) ordered (a regular hamburger with NO cheese and add avocado) because they had put cheese on it & was completely melted in. At least the fries were good.... Mistakes happen I guess but what a waste of food & money!"}
{"text":"It's a burger place. They are very friendly and flexible tough. Food allergy? Pick eater? No problem, they will help you through. They have gluten free buns and it's actually pretty tasty! The place looks nice and clean, staff always in a good mood and they have an outside area with a mist system to keep you cool - too bad it's right next to a dumpster. If you stop by, remember, they just opened and some of their staff is still in training - be kind."}
{"text":"Pretty laid back place! I don't eat burger but my partner does, so we went to this place by the outlet mall and their smash-fries are outstanding! They actually taste like chips! 

The hamburger meat doesn't come out of a freezer and you can taste it! (Yes I had to have a bite) 

The only thing... It's a little pricy! Specially when you have to basically wait your own food! (There's only one cashier and you pick up your order from a window that's connected to the main kitchen."}
{"text":"It took fifteen additional minutes, after the rest of the food had already come, to get my son's fries. They were part of the kid's meal, which we clearly ordered, but they didn't come out with the rest of the food, and then the guy who TOOK OUR ORDER seemed genuinely confused when I asked where the fries were.

Also, if I'm paying a extra dollar for bacon on my burger & they say I'll get three slices of bacon, why would they chop one slice of bacon into three little pieces and tell me they've given me three slices? It's misleading; I wouldn't have paid one dollar for so little of an extra item. They suggested next time I order EXTRA bacon! For another EXTRA dollar! 

How about no. And how about I don't come back."}
{"text":"This location serves one of the best burgers I've had here in LV.  This includes burger places on the Strip.  Rodney, who I assume is one of the managers, is awesome when it comes to customer service.  Very friendly and very accommodating.   Other employees have shown similar excellance in customer service.
We always get the truffle, mushroom burger. Thr burger is juicy and flavorful.  I've never had a bad burger here nor bad customer  service.   You should try it out!"}
{"text":"I like fatburger or five guys better. The burger was dripping with oil or liquid and took several napkins to contain the drip. I consumed the burger and feel okay but think there might be a better way of cooking it. Wasn't that impressed with the egg bun. The haystack onions (ie onion rings) were mediocre."}
{"text":"????????????????

{"text":"Great food and service.  Consistently a good buy and serving sizes are worth their prices.  Higher price burger and fries than McDs or BK, but as the saying goes- \"You get what you pay for.\"  I have returned on a number of occassions to this location and it has always been fresh and good.  This is another great place to take your family for good food, good service that is between a fast food joint and your local Chilis or Olive Garden.  3 meals each with a side and drink will run you about $30."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and a far better interior with more room than the Summerlin location. Found my new, and closer local Smashy!"}
{"text":"If u believed everything u read on yelp, u will never experience anything. U have to try something's for ur self. 
Smashburger is a good example. I seen a usual whiner abt stupid shit. All bent abt nothing. 
This place rocks. Period! Is everything perfect. Uh no. What is?  The service was great and the food was good. 
Not to mention it's near UNLV. So there's some nice young babes to look at. 
I had the bacon burger and fries. Personally I thought it's better than Five Guys. 
4 stars!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews normally but I think this is a great Restaurant and working in the industry unfortunately I disagree with walking in at 8:15 on a Thursday night and seeing have the restaurant closed because they close at 9:30! I have been here a couple time and seem to be a regular thing. Also hearing employee complain about more people walking in is outrageous. I think upper management should look into this problem as it is a bad look on this great restaurant! Every guest should be important and feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Finally hit up the Smashburger to see what it is all about! I joined the Smashburger club via their website and in return they emailed me a voucher for a free entree. Hell yeah a free burger of my choice sounds like a great time to give them a try! I did not have to manually print the coupon they accepted it via looking at and deleting the email from my phone.

I am glad we did as I was very happy and satisfied with my meal! The service is Amazing as well, all of the employees so helpful and sweet always checking on us to make sure everything is perfect! Andy and the crew at this location kick ass!!! 

They were even patient with me while I stood at the counter trying to decide what I wanted to order as the menu is neat how you can add stuff on to your burger. They have their own creations and they have the option to create your own burger or chicken burger. Lots of free toppings! Mmmmmm yum!

I decided on the \"Classic\" and decided on the \"big smash\" size which is 1/2 pound Angus burger. Includes American cheese, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, onion, pickles and smash sauce on an artisan egg bun. I added sweet relish and extra purple onion as a free add on. The sweet relish on my burger was divine, it just took the flavor and taste to a whole new level. Reminds me of when I was a kid and would order a burger from an old school diner my Mom would take me to in San Diego, CA, they put sweet relish on their burgers, I will never forget how good it was! Thank you for the trip back in time and fond memory Smashburger! :)

My boyfriend ordered the \"Spicy Baja\" which includes pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo, fresh jalapenos on a spicy chipotle bun. He added for .75 more fried pickles on the side and haystack onions to his burger. He really enjoyed his burger, his only complaint was that the meat patty is smashed out further than the bun. I said babe it is called \"Smashburger\" lol That is what I liked is that the meat patty was bigger than the bun, I enjoyed that meat hanging out on the sides mmmmm yum!

The Angus beef so juicy, flavorful and literally was running down my mouth and chin. They make a messy burger and they have plenty of napkins available on the tables. If a burger is not messy then it is not a well made burger!

We also ordered smashfries to share which are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic, mmmm delicious as well.

This was truly a treat for our lunch today! I enjoyed it very much along with the Outstanding service we received from Andy and the crew!

We will be back! They have a burger worth sucking silly and I want to do it again!

Our total for two burgers, two drinks and fries was $25 after my coupon for my free burger it brought it down to $18. Had a great lunch, tried a new place and saved some money! WIN WIN WIN!

Thank you for the happy ending Smashburger, my tummy thanks you! :)"}
{"text":"Not bad. Not bad at all.

Salads are a good size for the price, though with how much dressing is added, I doubt it's much healthier than a burger. Still, it tasted good. The burgers aren't too greasy and I like that there's different size options.

Staff was friendly and restaurant was clean. I wouldn't mind stopping in again."}
{"text":"3.5 - rounded up to 4 for great service -  

Not a bad burger joint at all.  

After a nice little hike at Red Rocks, Killer was craving was some red meat and claimed that if I didn't take her to a burger joint soon, that she'd be taking a chunk out of ME.

Well, seeing as how I'm rather fond of all my attached parts, I decided to find her a burger joint close to Red Rocks - PRONTO.

We looked at our trusty Yelp app and it pointed us down Lake Mead to a place called \"Create\" , but after zooming up and down Lake Mead for several minutes and failing to find Create, I was lucky enough to spot Smashburger before I lost a limb. 

Tried out the BIG \"Sin City\" burger which had a single 1/3/lb patty, applewood smoked bacon, fried egg, fried onion strings, grilled onions and their special sauce on a multi-grain bun and it wasn't bad.  better than the average fast food burger (but I still miss Kilroy's) - it was a bit salty though, so it definitely could've used a sweet component in the burger. 

The smash fries were perfectly crisp and well seasoned with olive oil and rosemary

I actually like how the restaurant is laid out.  The entrance flows straight to the registers and through to either the indoor dining area or the outdoor patio. 

ProTIP: They server BEER! -  Also: Cherry Coke at the Fountain - BONUS!"}
{"text":"I used to love Smashburger but my last two visits the quality and service were poor. This time they lured me in with a special from their app on my phone but it took forever for my order to come and when it came there was no burger just the tots they weren't very hot. When the burger finally came it was barely warm. I should've sent it back but I was starving and needed to get going. Will not be back anytime soon to matter what coupon they send me this time."}
{"text":"My first visit and last visit to a Smash BurgerId give it zero stars, but to leave a review I had to have at least one. My burger came out shoe leather over cooked when I ordered media.  When I asked the manager in duty a woman by the name of Lacy whether or not the could prepare burgers medium, he response was \"yes, we can but you know sometimes things get mixed up in the kitchen. \" she then promptly walked away like that was a suitable and ok response.  Probably the rudest response I have ever heard. No offer to fix or refund. She needs retraining in customer service, and being busy is not an excuse."}
{"text":"Ok, so the food is yummy, but for the new place in town they seem a little cocky about their new popularity. My coworker raved about the caramel+chocolate milkshake that she got on her last 3 visits to this location After being sold on the idea of coming here for a caramel+chocolate shake on our lunch hour by my coworker, I was a less than amused by the employees attitude towards us while placing our order. Really, a milkshake is ice-cream, milk and syrup (either chocolate, caramel or strawberry) how hard is it to put a measure of chocolate AND caramel in the mix? The snarky employee refused stating \"just pick one or the other\"! She stated that everything was pre-measured but the obvious flavor syrups were there in front of us and they were just liter bottles with a pump on top. What gives? If they are this cocky when they are new and trying to establish a reputation how will they be in 6 months? I hope they are still around because the food is good, just with a crew of employees with better attitudes!"}
{"text":"Of all the Smashburger locations in Las Vegas this one is the best! The food is really really good but the customer service of this location is what sets them apart, they are WONDERFUL!"}
{"text":"I used to eat in and out burger. My husband is a 5 guy burger guy. But after coming here we can both agree on a good burger joint."}
{"text":"Food: OK. Chicken and burger proteins lacked flavor. Shoestring fries were the highlight of our dinner. 

Presentation: Clean. 

Staff: Professional, friendly. 

Ambiance: Comfortable seating. Need to bring in more warmth to the space. Felt a bit sterile. Music  was too low, which created an awkward space. 

Verdict: Smashburger is a solid 3-star restaurant. The food was not noteworthy, but if in a rush and nearby, we will keep it on the reserve list. The biggest pointers for improvement are warming up the decor and added flavor to both the chicken and beef. Kosher salt and coarse pepper go a long way!"}
{"text":"Had the sin city buger and crispy fries.GF had the mushroom  swiss burger.   It was great cooked just right and tasty.  Manager checked with everyone about their meal and no complaints. A first. They keep it cool in the restaurant  but just ask and they will turn it off for awhile."}
{"text":"Very good service! Bacon and cheese were pretty skimpy.. We all ended up ordering the Arizona burger.. Delicious! It was so cold inside we ended up sitting outside."}
{"text":"Ok Matt the manager is a proactive guy as most of the staff trying to be on ball. 
The WiFi has a lot to be desired, let's just say there is none so it's hard to get coupon/meal credits. Matt had to figure out ways to get around it since the receipt did not have a bar code to scan also the coupon on the ap although it seamed to have read it, it didn't register on the order. 
Now for the big part, the shake was ok I wouldn't run in to get another one unless it was a basic vanilla, chocolate or strawberry. 
The burger left a lot to be desired. It was dried out and as the pic shows, very little toppings, thus not helping it out at all. 

The salad which was small compared to other places for the same price, it became 1/2 the size the next day. 
The fries straw fries with the dipping sauce was the best thing. 
I will give this place another try and hope it gets better. First time I went it was fresh and the meat was juicy, but then I was told the burger joint down the road is amazing so they will have competition if they want to keep going here."}
{"text":"Geez, what happened here since my last visit (mid-2015)???  Long line and only one register open.  Finally made it to the register after 15 minutes.  Easy order: 2 classic Smash burgers, order of Smash fries, vanilla malt, chocolate milkshake.  Received the burgers after 10 minute wait (acceptable), but no fries, no malt, no shake.  Stopped an employee after waiting several more minutes to ask about rest of order.  He had to ask the guy cooking in back who had to ask the guy at the register (they lost my ticket)....they were all confused.  Gave them my receipt as proof of my complete order.  Got fries but had to wait another 10 minutes for drinks!  Vanilla malt had large chunks of ice, burgers were way over-seasoned.  One small piece of lettuce and 2 extremely thin shards of red onion topped both burgers.  Such a huge disappointment!  I used to come here frequently and touted this place as the best burger ever.  Burgers used to be \"stuffed\" with lettuce, onions, etc. and tasted incredible.  Malts and shakes were to die for!  Sadly, not true anymore.  No one there seemed to be in charge.  Will need to find somewhere else for my burger fix!  :-("}
{"text":"Been working uber all day I pulled up few min before 10 closing time Brandon welcomed me with great smile and made me the best burger. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I am in Phoenix for the weekend and after golf we wanted a quick dinner to pick up and bring home.  We decided to give Smashburger a try and we were not all disappointed. I had the black bean burger and sweet potato fries and both were very good. My friend had the grilled chicken breast and he was also very pleased. The was ready quickly, the prices were very reasonable and the staff welcoming!"}
{"text":"$12 for burger, fries, and soda.  Unbelievable how much some of these \"nicer\" fast food places charge.  Added jalapenos to my burger and it was just four little rings in the middle.  What kind of add-on topping value is that?  On top of this, the habanero cheese isn't really hot at all.  Parking is atrocious since it shares spots with Jimmy Johns and others."}
{"text":"My first thought of this place was... another fast food joint. And that is what it is, fast food joint; but its very different and they actually have great burger combinations (both chicken or beef) and their fries and amazing!, specially because they have sweet potato fries!. Their shake are pretty sweet!, but at least for me still dairy queen has the best shakes. As for the service I like that they are very quick at it, even on crowded days."}
{"text":"First time trying this location. I usually go to the one in Stonecrest but received a coupon to try the new location. The registers for ordering are right next to the door, creating a very tight environment, won't be fun come winter time. Booth seats seem abnormally low. My husband got his usual BBQ, bacon cheddar and seemed pretty satisfied with it. I tried something new (the burger with mushroom and Swiss) I should have stuck with my usual of the baja burger, this new one lacked the flavor I'm used too. The smash fries were really good as always. Service was also great, everyone was so curious and constantly checked on us. I am glad there is now a location closer to center city."}
{"text":"Other than a small hiccup with the power (oh no! Lights out for 30 seconds) it was a pleasant visit. We entered with 10 other people, but the line moved quickly. 

[A representative of the Smashburgers in this area had reached out to me, and sent vouchers, asking me to revisit last month.]

We ordered (and used our vouchers) paid for our reminder (large order, and the milkshakes were irresistible. Hey it's a hot day) and sat down. We had our food within 15 minutes bagged and ready to go. They look to have handled just as many orders today with less personal than last time. The manager was the one ringing everyone up and running the front counter today too.

We just finished eating at home:

Smelled and tasted delicious. We're contemplating going back for another 3 burgers! My friends who are local here swear by Smashburger. I'm hoping the last time was just an isolated event. 

Will probably returning in a few weeks through that area and will be definitely considering grabbing a burger to go."}
{"text":"Been awhile since I was there, I guess I should actually write the review.

From what I remember, the service was good.  The menu is not that overly complicated.  Build your own or pick a combo.  Pretty simple.  If you can't figure that out, stick with McyD's.  

The food was great, very juicy & the meat was mildly seasoned with salt and pepper.  It didn't detract from the bun, cheese or additions.  The price is a little more than you'd pay at the 'other' burger joints.  But the quality is noticeably superior.  (IE: You get what you pay for.)"}
{"text":"I was here on Friday afternoon and it took over a half-hour for me to get my food.  I finally had to ask someone about my order.  The burger was salty and overly saturated with sauces and my smash fries were cold.  Not a very good first impression Smash."}
{"text":"Smash burger is the bomb dot com. Im a fan! The burgers are always on point and I have never had a problem coming here. It has always been a wonderful experience. I wish they had more locations though. Hopefully they will open some locations in WA state!"}
{"text":"Really tasty burger.  The meat is well seasoned and juicy.  Sides are so so, especially the fried vegetables which were extremely greasy.  Basic fries are pretty good but not the best."}
{"text":"Long line almost out the door but only one cashier and they did not even bother to open another cashier counter. Took 20mins to get to place my order."}
{"text":"Burger was 'ok'.   For the amount of $$$ you pay i would say it's not worth it.    Fries with the buffalo seasoning on it was pretty good.      It was 'Milk Shake Monday' so...  that was def the savings grace for today's visit.   For the 'price point', I would certainly recommend FiveGuys over SmashBurger"}
{"text":"Ordered the bacon cheeseburger with everything on it. Went to eat it and it only had onions, cheese and bacon. The burger didn't have mustard, ketchup, or anything else I had asked for and surprised how small the patty actually was.  The spice on the buffalo fries wasn't consistent and they were a little underdone. Doubt I'll be going back."}
{"text":"UGH WHY.  

SALTY onion rings, oil dripping down my arm, and bread slightly cold. 

saving grace was the nice cashier"}
{"text":"A really good burger, and some unique appetizers.  We had brussel sprouts, PLUS french fries. The burgers were tasty, with lots of options for toppings, and different bun options. We sat outside in a decent area. The only downside, no craft beer. But for a burger, I would say one of the better ones I've had."}
{"text":"The avocado club sandwich was quite tasty. Staff was friendly and courteous.  Can't think of anything that could make it better!"}
{"text":"Went there a while back ago and now going to make my review very delicious great food and service I definitely will be going back again when I can. The smash fries and sauce are the best."}
{"text":"Yum!  I like in-n-out and five guys as well, but I may prefer this place by a hair for the below reasons:

1) Garlic rosemary fries.  I love garlic and rosemary, and I liked that they are thin cut fries.  You get a nice crunch that way.  Mine weren't pooling in oil, but I see how this could easily be an issue if someone gets a tad overzealous in the kitchen.
2) The bun.  Doesn't look like anything special, but tasted better than the competitions to me.
3) They have milkshakes.  Made with haagen-dazs ice cream.

It's not my regular burger spot, but definitely satisfies a particular craving, and like the 4-star description says, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Smashburger was because I had a Groupon.  I didn't know what to expect, but ordered a burger to go, with fries, and it was really good.  Since then, I've visited several times and now know a bit more about it.  The ordering process is simple and they have a membership card now where you can dine for free after so many visits.  The burgers are made fresh, to order, and are awesome.  The sweet potato fries a wonderful and you have to get a shake to go with your meal.  This is a splurge place for me and I love it.  All visits have been consistent with excellent food.  These are my favorite burgers in Vegas.  No need for In-n-Out when you can go to Smashburger!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from so many friends I decided to finally check this place out.  It's close to campus, well-lit, clean, and definetly within a college student's budget.  The portion sizes are good and I have to admit that I'm a little in love with the BBQ Bacon burger.  Bacon pretty much always makes everything better, but I really appreciated the shoestring onion rings in the burger.  They are perfectly cooked and I think they make the burger.  The only reason I'm not giving Smashburger 4 starts is because their \"famous\" fries are too intense.  They have garlic and rosemary, but both flavors are so strong that I feel it worked against the rest of the food.  Oh well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have came here on several occasions but usually to go as it's on my way home from work.  We've always been pleased with the quality of the food. The Burgers are always very tasty, the Smash Fries and onion rings are excellent, and the staff is typically friendly and helpful.  

I have only had one off experience. One time they forgot to put the bacon on both burgers we ordered.  No big deal right? Well my girlfriend thought we should let them know especially since we did in fact pay extra for it. When she called in to inform them of the error the graciously offered to provide us a free meal on them.  They were extremely polite and apologetic. Needless to say when we went back a couple of weeks later it was just as promised.  There wasn't any confusion or hassle in the matter whatsoever.  Now this may not sound like much but when they consistently make good food, provide quality service and genuinely appreciate their customers...I'll be back time and time again.  We will be long time customers!!  BTW..the Arizona Burger is awesome."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Smashburger! Many of my friends raved about this place and said I had to try it! 

I ordered the Baja Smashburger, it was  tasty and had just the right amount of  spice. I love jalapeños on my burger. The bun on this burger also had a kick to it, and made the burger that much more tasty! 

I would also recommend the Smash fries! They had such a good flavor and I found myself devouring them!!!

My visit was satisfying and I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Quite good, and friendly service !! 2nd time here, will be returning. I also just found out that you can order online ahead of time. Save your receipt for future savings."}
{"text":"It is a nice fast food burger joint but nothing special. The greek fries are awesome but the burger is average as are the prices. Good place for a pit stop."}
{"text":"I had the smash fries and an Arizona burger both were really good. Luckily, I was able to sneak in before the lunch rush, there was a long line. I didn't like the paper lined wire mesh trays, I thought I was going to make a mess. All-in-all great good and atmosphere. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My to-go salad was packed without dresssing. It is a pain in the rear end to park at the Richmar Plaza so I really don't have the energy to drive back, wait for parking, wait in that line again (it was neglected for several minutes when I was picking up) and get the dressing. The coffee shake is amazingly delicious, but tiny compared to the dine-in shakes. I guess this reminds me why I don't go to smash burger."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone downhill. Got a Take Out order this evening, ordered online. Picked up with out checking the bag, yeah that's on me. Fries were not in the order. Ordered my burger with lettuce, onions, tomatoe, pickles, ketchup, mustard and mayo. Received a dried out burger with mushrooms, white cheese and mayo. Not to mention ketchup and mustard packets on the side? (see pic) I don't know why that bugged me so much? I guess because I thought this was custom burgers made to order, not a cafeteria. 
Upon trying to call the store, it was answered with a very strange, whispering recording. No one would answer personally. Unfortunately had to drive up there, burger in hand for a refund. Certainly didn't want a replacement, just in case. Manager was very apologetic, baffled, having seen the ticket, how such a huge mistake got made. Did get a refund for the fries (after reminding) and the burger. Not for the other burger, that was as ordered and veggie frites. Not too often a \"freebie\" is desired but in this case for the hassle of having to drive back, it would have been called for. 
The veggies frites were pretty good. Greasier than before and sadly not good enough to warrant a return after this boondoggle. 
Sad to see a place not meet up to the standards they started off with. Off to Jack In The Box."}
{"text":"Awesome juicy burgers. I got the bbq burger and it was so good. I was sorry I did not make it a double. Great burgers"}
{"text":"Another success for a chain that shows promise to dominate the burger scene! This newest Las Vegas location offers delicious made to order burgers, chicken sandwiches and milkshakes (loved the pb&j).
Ask for the fried pickles, which are not on the menu but the \"secret menu.\" The sweet potato fries were also great. The burger with truffle oil & mushrooms was a standout for me, and I will return for more!"}
{"text":"As a first time customer, the food exceeded my expectations!
Sin City smashburger- Egg! Bacon! How can you go wrong with that combo?? A very flavorful, beautifully cooked burger. The two types of onions also added flavor to the sandwich. Love the egg bun too.
Mushroom/Swiss smashchicken- Nice combination for a chicken sandwich, and I got the chipotle bun which was a good choice. 
Downside- Awful music at this location. It was club music and I don't get why any retail business would play music geared toward a specific age group."}
{"text":"Chicken truffle is the best! I get that every time. Buy one get one shake if you're wearing green on St. Patrick's day!"}
{"text":"1st of all let me say that Smashburger Corporate customer service is amazing. I had an issue when I signed up for the Rewards and went to the Ballantyne location, but they solved it ten fold. Now customer service at this location wasn't that great, which is sad, because I only got take out. When I walked up to the counter, I showed him my reward on the App and he responds \"Ok\". So then I say\"This is my 1st time here\", because I didn't know their process for claiming rewards and he just stared blankly at me. So I think to myself I guess i'll just order. I ordered the Big Create Your Own Beef Burger with Cheese, Bacon, Lettuce, Spinach, Cucumber, Onion & Pickle, Regular Smash Fries and a Regular Drink. So once I complete my order he tells me to scan my reward, which I didn't know where the scanner was. Being my 1st time, he could have at least pointed to it. But he just stared at me as I searched. Then once I find it, its turned backwards, instead of positioning properly for me, of course I had to do it myself. So I was annoyed with this entire interaction. But the food made up for it. I loved the nice grilled taste of their hand pattied burgers. The fries had a very unique flavor that i could see myself craving later. They were also fried perfectly to a crisp. I will definitely return and hopefully since I figured everything out today my ordering process will be better."}
{"text":"Good milkshake. The cashier was sweet.
The place was a mess. And the food is WAYYYY over priced. Could have gone to red robin for cheaper and better.

First time ok... But probably not a returning customer"}
{"text":"I have found a new place! I've passed by it many times, but never gave it a thought. So glad we stopped for the BBQ burger and Buffalo fries. We will definitely be back! 

Staff is great as well. Very helpful."}
{"text":"Just as good as advertised!! Much better than in and out In quality and the staff has been very well trained!  All you need now is a drive thru and 800 more California locations!!"}
{"text":"Use the app! Truffle Mushroom Burger is tasty. I'm a lifelong customer because of it."}
{"text":"Its a nice alternative to other fast food burger places. 
The add ons are killer! Talk about variety, and most are included with your price. Pile that burger high, or keep it as is.....whatever you fancy.
Its a good place to sit down, and enjoy the time with friends, family, and company....or take it home with you (like im doing this time).
The vibe is good, and the burgers are good. Doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"In my search for the perfect burger, I was hoping I found a winner. The buns are good, but no different than Fuddruckers. I found the burger itself to be a little too salty and greasy. Didn't care for the fries or the onion strings at all. 

It's a clean and reasonably priced venue but it just doesn't do it for me."}
{"text":"I was expecting great things after having attended a wonderful Yelp function at one Smashburger and having a very nice meal at another.  This Smashburger locale was anything but satisfying.

The cashier was friendly and helpful.  The place was clean.  But the food didn't satisfy.  I ordered a Windy City burger,  limited-time special burger that was unmemorable.  My husband had an Avocado Club burger, and we shared a Spinach and Goat Cheese salad.  We both agreed that the meat tasted very strange - not spoiled, just indescribably weird.  Both looked nothing like the alluring pictures.  The salad was okay, nothing wrong with it, but it was just ordinary.

If we ever decide to go back to a Smashburger, it won't be this one, for sure."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what in the world was going on tonight, but it was terrible. Ordered on the phone and was told 15 minutes before my order would be started. No problem. I showed up at 20 minutes figuring on a few more minutes wait. The line was almost to the door. I walked to the pickup area and was told they were waiting on the fries. I noticed the bag of burgers under the lamp. Someone hands me my sons shake.

 A few minutes later the fries come out. There is only one register operating and the guy asks if I've paid, then looks at the one open register and the long line and tells me to hold on. I wait another 10 minutes and finally the 1 cashier on duty waves me over to pay. The shake is now completely melted. One of the guys apologizes and says there are coupons in the bag for next time. The guy behind me said he called around the same time I did and was told there would a 14 minute MORE wait. The reason people call in the orders is to NOT wait in line, and yet we waited longer? 

Anyways,  I got home and these burgers were cold. Like, not even semi warm and the meat was dried out. My 17 year old will eat just about anything, and barely ate 1/2. Fries- stale and cold. Not sure why it took so long, because they obviously weren't freshly made. No one ate theirs. Shake- melted and warm. Coupons are for use within the next 2 weeks only. I won't be using them. Very disappointed. Smash burgers needs to hire more cashiers and figure out a better method for busy nights. Way too expensive for the lack of quality in both the food, and the service.

Side note: As I waited, I noticed a LOT of empty, dirty tables. It always looks unkempt when I come in."}
{"text":"Locale is clean, staff is friendly. Had the classic chicken, smash fries and lemon herb tea. Food is good, price is reasonable. Had a good lunch."}
{"text":"Worst experience again ...... The cook had no gloves.... Waited half an hour before my food came out. Too bad normally the food is good\"\" Service sucks\""}
{"text":"Smashburger is great place for a quick and delicious lunch! Plenty of great choices to choose from or basically a build your own burger option too! Friendly staff! Clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"Meh....greasy. 

I ordered the Sin City burger since, well, I live in Sin City ;) It came with fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and fried onion stings and smash sauce, served on an egg bun. It sounded amazing, but overall it was just very very greasy.  The bacon was a little soggy and not crispy, and they were very skimpy with the fried onion strings. The smash sauce is pretty tasty tho! Would def recommend. 

I also ordered smash fries, which smelled great (rosemary/italian seasoning? yum!), but after about 10 mins, after the fries cooled off, didn't taste so good. 

Overall, I always compare my burgers to what I believe to be their equivalent.... So Smashburger is getting compared to Shake Shack bc of price.  Overall, I think the burger here is only OK. Shake shack's burger has better flavor.  Smashburger does give you more options, including a build-your-own menu, but even then, the burger is just so greasy, I taste fat more than flavor. 

To be honest, I would even prefer In & Out to Smashburger since I think the flavor is better (and it's almost half the price). 

Service is very friendly, and food service was fast.
Clean fast foody restaurant space."}
{"text":"Solid burger chain. I really like the Spicy Baja style great with Burger. Good with grilled chicken. Wish they did a little more to the chicken. Still quality food though"}
{"text":"I would give Five Stars alone for their sweet potato fries. I put one in my mouth and didn't even realize that I was just eating them away. I look down and they are almost gone. What the heck?! Where did they go? In my belly, yep.

But other than the sweet potato fries I don't know how much I would rant and rave about this place. 

I ordered a sin city burger and it was tasty. The patty itself was well flavored. The bun was soft and buttery. My egg was just how I not like, well done and crispy. But overall it was a solid burger. Bacon was one strip cut in half to try to cover most of the burger, didn't work out so well.

The regular smash fries suck though. Bland, limp and major suck-age. The haystack onions were pretty tasty, just kinda greasy. 

I walked away from this place really enjoying their burger but I don't know if it is the best burger ever. 

I was crippled by poor customer service, starting from the girl who didn't know how to ring us up and ended up using the wrong groupon.  That itself was an experience. I am not sure that they felt so bad about it. They made me feel like I was crippling them with my problem. Manager finally came and said sorry to me as we were about to leave our table while cracking her knuckles. In my opinion, just not so professional. Maybe it's a nervous tick for her but it can easily be misconstrued and taken another way.

It's a fancy dressed up burger with a fast food feel to it. Definitely worth trying at least once. I would return if I was with others and they wanted to go, just don't know I would say I had to go to this place to have their burgers. The sweet potato fries, yes."}
{"text":"Good burgers, even better grilled chicken burgers!  Portion could be larger, as I can easily finish two plus a salad and a malt shake.  Pricier than most other burger joints, but the taste is better too.  Tables are usually clean, but the seats are not always wiped down.  That's the quick 15 second elevator ride summary.

And now the verbose version :p

So, Groupon offered a burger promo a few months back to a few burger joints around Vegas.  Smashburger was one of the options, and I selected the Lake Mead location because I have never been to this location before.

It is located in a popular strip mall plaza (Dolphin Court Day Spa, Grape Street, Starbuck, DQ, Walgreen, and a Red Box) and gets plenty of traffic.  But on a chilly Thursday evening in November, I did not have to wait at all to place my order nor have trouble finding a booth to sit down and enjoy the Chocolate Malt Shake and Grilled Chicken Avocado Club plus a side order of Smashwedge salad.

Their Grilled Chickens are always nice and juicy, and what you end up ordering will be up to your personal preference or your mood.  I went with the Avocado Club option, and it was delicious. 

The Side of Smashwedge Salad was pretty good, but you have to really love blue cheese and blue cheese dressing.

Their milkshakes and malts are all very good.  Today I went with the Chocolate Malt, and it was as delicious as always.

Only gripe about dining at Smashburger is that the burgers and chicken sandwiches are not at all a big hearty sandwich, and a growing teenager or someone with a healthy appetite can easily put away two of them.  Which means taking out a family of four here can easily put a small dent in a parent's wallet.

Service was good, and my order was placed without any issues.  

Location:  SW.  Near the 95 and Summerlin Parkway..

Taste:  4/5  I like the food I have had at Smashburger overall, except I am not a fan of their \"onion rings\".  All their milkshakes and malts are excellent!

Price:  3/5  A tad pricier compared to their peers.

Quality:  5/5 Everything appears to be made from fresh ingredients.

Parking:  3/5  In a busy plaza with plentiful parking spaces, although not all of them are right outside the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Smashburger - have heard about it from friends and read favorable reviews on Yelp.  Was able to sample their menu recently at their W. Sahara/Fort Apache location and I couldn't believe that I have never noticed it being there, since i drove past it on a regular basis on my way to the West Sahara Library or Boca Park.  The restaurant is cheerfully decorated and have seating for about 80 people. The menu on the wall is nice and large, so you can read and ponder which item to try on your visit or ask the friendly and helpful cashier for their recommendations.

These are the items I have tried thus far (for menu item description you can easily navigate to their menu page on the SM website):

BBQ Ranch Smashchicken - overall a good chicken burger, which was nicely flavored and juicy. 

Haystack Onions - works inside the burgers, but not as a standalone sides.  Why?  It was why over salted and over fried (at least the one I was served).

Sweet Potato Smashfries - I like it!  The rosemary and garlic flavor is subtle and enhances the yummy earthy treat.

Honey Mustard Chicken Salad - I think this is a good salad, but the breading of the chicken is not mixed very well, since some pieces are really salty and others are just good.  I like their Honey Mustard dressing.  Salad is a decent size, but I would like to see a little more for $7.

Oreo Milkshake - New item on their menu and it was good.  Although I still prefer the one from Jack In the Box better.
Chocolate Milkshake - Good chocolate flavor, can never good wrong with this one.

Overall, I think Smashburger is a good burger joint that is a little different from the major national chains and worth giving it a try.  And in my book is a 3-3.5 stars eatery.  Why not a higher rating? Price is on the high side for fast casual burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Sin City Burger, I've missed you.  Just a little over 2 years ago, the Smashburger was a wee tot and had just opened up.  I had the pleasure of dining here twice before I moved back to LA.  So, while visiting Vegas last week, I relished the chance to go back, eat, and have an opportunity to look at it anew with Yelper eyes.

Lots of tasty choices from burgers ($5-7, offered in 2 sizes), to salads ($6), to grilled chicken sandwiches ($6-7), hot dogs ($5), sides ($2-3), haagen-dazs shakes ($4), and chili ($3).  The prices are really reasonable, and if you don't fancy any of the selections, you can create-your-own anything here.

Re-living a not too recent favorite, I chose the Sin City Burger (american cheese, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and served on an egg bun, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aXY6Ejxdb1RpLzp5Q4COVQ&userid=ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A).  Instead of glorious fries, I chose the veggie frites (flash fried carrots and green beans).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#ejIvLEaxT5wsCd_UvtQRSQ
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#afd8gM9iwR4AZ1mcdECpyg

I think for the price-point of a $7 burger (1/2 pounder), it's very good and very messy...couldn't eat the whole burger without it breaking into pieces.  Taste wise, it's in the neighborhood of a In-and-Out, Johnny Rockets, or a Fatburger.  The meat is hand-formed, but thin and larger than the bun.  Seasoned lightly (I remembered it differently from before), but the quality of the meat is less than a gourmet burger (many which are found in my \"Berger knows Burgers\" list, http://www.yelp.com/list/berger-knows-burgers-los-angeles-2).

The Veggie Frites, great choice to save on carbs, and a unique offering at a burger place.  Green beans and carrots, flash-fried, sounds great. Unfortunately, I found them really boring, really oily, and with no pizazz or seasoning.  I ended up adding a ton of salt to it, so sure, no carbs, but now -- not even healthy.  And, WTH -- are you flipping me off?  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#P-k5gqRqkCBad8G2rw9WRw

In summary, while the price-point for individual items seems reasonable, they didn't offer a combo price, so my tab (with a soda) ran over $12.  Not an inexpensive burger lunch adventure by any means.  Would I go back again, absolutely.  The food is fresh, the decor is contemporary in red and white (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ) with big painted words of \"Smash\", \"Sizzle\", and \"Savor\" --- and if you know me at all -- I love a good burger fix, and I'll find one in any city across the country."}
{"text":"Seems ok... Food looks spot on and the staff are cool so basically it's a smashing Bash get ready eat and hit the road"}
{"text":"Dontez is incredible!!! From the time I walked in to the time I left! Way to set the bar for customer service !"}
{"text":"I did not like smashburger at all!

The people were super friendly but the food was not good at all. 

Deserves zero stars. The burger didn't taste like a burger at all. There was barely any lettuce or bbq sause (I got the bbq and bacon burger). It was bland and just not tasteful at all. 

I do not know what all the hype is about this place. I will never return here again. 

Save your money, go elsewhere. 

The meat was nasty (tasted like chewy dense cardboard), there wasn't enough sauce on the bbq bacon burger. Just over all not good. I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times, and the food is good. I'd give the food 4 stars, but the wait for your food is way too long. I did a take out order the last time I was there, and it took 22 minutes for them to get me two chicken sandwiches and two french fries. 22 minutes! And this was on a week night after 7pm! That is a really long time to make someone wait for such a small amount of food. I do love their smash fries and the grilled chicken club sandwiches, but I'm not sure if I would want to go there again and have to wait that long. I'm also not a fan of how pricey they are."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place out of pure chance. He had previously asked if I had eaten here before but I only actually came here when a friend wanted to pick up some jalepeno poppers for his mom; I never had actually eaten here until now.

We had our 6 month old dog, Mistral with us and I was very cautious about bringing her inside. She is a service dog in training and while she was still being desensitized to different things, I didn't want to approach food establishments just yet. My husband ran in to check and that's where we found out that they were actually dog friendly. We had to sit outside, which there was no fuss of and we ended up ordering 2 cheesebugers for ourselves and Mistral ended up having their \"fidoburger\" which is just an unseasoned beef patty with lettuce. Needless to say, with her, that didn't last long. She absolutely enjoyed it, same to say with my husband and I's dinner. I'm usually not a big stickler for fries, but they were still pretty good. The girls fangirled and squealed over our dog and Mistral enjoyed every bit of it (they even offered her water when we forgot to bring her water bowl.) So if you're ever out and about with the 4 legged family members and are hungry, I would definitely recommend this place. It has something for everyone, an aspect that not alot of restaurant can offer. Will be back,"}
{"text":"I just picked up a Harvest Salad w/grilled chicken to go.   The chicken was there, but just a tiny bit of the other ingredients. It wasn't even side salad size; not what is supposed to be an $8.00 dinner salad.  Having to go back out somewhere to get my wife an entree."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service paired with delicious food! Major kudos to the managers here. You'd think this would be a no-brainer for food joints but not many managers are as hands on as these guys. They help at the register, bus tables, and even get on the grill! They're handing out coupons, talking with customers making sure everything is great, it's just been a great experience every time I've visited. Rosemary smash fries are the bomb too!!"}
{"text":"Well, after not eating here for about a year and finally trying it again recently, I am sorry to say that Smashburger has gone downhill! It just isn't as good as it used to be.

A lot of items were taken away from the menu. They no longer serve crispy fried chicken. Really?? WHY?? I know that grilled chicken is healthier, but come on, sometimes I am in the mood for fried chicken! The Chicken Avocado Club that I used to love wasn't the same. They also took away their hot dogs and there are less varieties of salads. The sweet potato fries used to be awesome when they were tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. I was really looking forward to eating these again, but now they are plain and seasoned with sea salt. 

There are big digital menus by the register, which is nice. The cashier wasn't too friendly, but the girl who brought our food to the table was. She stopped by our table and checked on us twice. Pretty good service for a fast food place.

Sorry Smashburger, but you have been smashed down on my list of burger joints! Looks like I'll be going back to In-N-Out and getting chicken sandwiches elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I've had both the burger and the chicken sandwich here, and I think they're delicious! They are quite seasoned, and don't taste like anyone else's food.  I also love the Smash fries, which have rosemary - unique and delicious!  I'm also always a fan of burger joints that sell Oreo milkshakes. They just go together! 
This place is usually pretty packed, which means a short-ish wait to order, a medium wait for your food to come out, and the occasional wait for a clean table.  They certainly make the most of their small storefront, which means the tables are a bit crammed together.  Not the place for a private meal.  
All in all, i love this place for the food! And really, I can't complain that they're busy, because that just means they'll probably stick around!"}
{"text":"Breaking News: The Hulk decided to open his very own burger joint and called it Smashburger.  Whaaaa? you asked.  That's right.  The Hulk's signature move is now being incorporated into how his burgers are made.

Splat.  Splat.  

Okay, okay.  I was joking of course.  For all we know, he really did come up with this.  ;-p

The funny thing though is, I never really order the beef burgers here.  I LOVE, LOVE their crispy chicken burgers with swiss mushrooms! Sooo effing goood! The patty is so crispy while the breast meat is tender and juicy! TRUST ME.  YOU NEED TO TRY.

The buns hun! fantastic! 

I think within the last year or so, they've revamped their decor and added an \"Ice Tea Bar.\"  Its kind of cool, cuz the Tea Dispenser is in a tubular, modern shape and colorful too making it \"pop.\"  I usually get their mango passion or something like that.  Its awesome!

I'm hungry just typing this out."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. It was a bit on the expensive side but if you're looking for a really tasty burger then come through.

My friends and I stopped by Smashburger on our way home to Riverside, CA, from CES 2017! I'm not exactly sure how we heard about this place but I was just along for the ride! I'm glad we stopped by because the food was delicious! The Smashburger was so juicy and cooked to perfection. It left me wanting more. I did order one of the most basic burgers so there's definitely more to try before solidifying the rating, but it left a great impression on me!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place being \"the best\" burger joint so i had to check it our for myself. My boyfriend and i went on a saturday afternoon and to my surprise most of the seats were taken, people were coming and going so my first thought was they must be good since they were so busy. Severs were really nice and prompt.

we both ordered their 1/3 lb arizona smashburger which has: habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipolte mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun, we also had an order of their smash fries.

first thought, the presentation of the burgers and fries looked great, after putting mustard and ketchup on it and TRIED to pick up the burger everything almost feel out. It was messy and greasy totally ruined the experience of enjoying the burger. It tasted like any other burger, nothing really special about it. Their fries however were amazing. 

on a scale of 1-10 i would give this place a 6 just for the food presentation. my boyfriend said he wouldn't go back but i'll give it another try one day."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place out for some time now!  I had a smash burger $4.99 and the smash fries $1.99 and both were really good.  The smash fries are my favorite for sure, they are the skinny fries and they are made with olive oil and rosemary....VERY good!   there were four of us and we all had fries and burgers.  Two had the chocolate shake and they were quite delish as well.  The bill came to $35 prob cause the shakes alone were $4 each.  Compared to an in and out this was far better...IMO."}
{"text":"One bite of the Smashburger veggie burger had me wondering if there's a conspiracy amongst burger makers to create veggie burgers as punishment for people that have decided to stop eating meat. While they work on the recipe in their kitchen, I wonder if they're thinking, \"You wanna stop eating meat??!!? There! Eat THIS!!\"

There isn't 1 good veggie burger I've had from any food place. I've had zero beef for 18 years (tons of carbs, though), so I could say I've had more than a few veggie burgers. And I think maybe I've had enough. I'm at a point where I'm ready to give up, because it looks like the best veggie burgers are all in the freezer section of grocery stores.

Always an afterthought, restaurant veggie burgers are never taken seriously enough. Maybe burger joints just don't want to lose out on sales (understandably), so they add a veggie burger to their menu. Unfortunately, the taste of these burgers reflect this decision.

The Smashburger veggie burger itself was as expected, a mushy mess salvaged by the egg bun, the cheese & the truffle oil. I wonder if they had cows taste-test the burger, & the cows were like MOO, it's OK, thanks for our lives or something. I mean, I dunno. If your granola friend has been trying to get you to convert to veg, this wouldn't be the burger she would be having you try.

The service was great but Smashburger, please make a good veggie burger."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! We walked in having no idea what the menu was like. The guy working there was super friendly and made us feel comfortable about taking our time ordering and was even pitching in and telling us about the customer favorites. 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks cost us under $25!! The food came out super quick and it was DELICIOUS! Five guys is too expensive, in n out takes forever...smash burger is the perfect burger spot! Amazing food, amazing price, amazing energy and staff! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I think the food is great. I had the az burger which was really spicy, but I loved it. The fries are good. It's a little pricey but I think it's worth it occasionally. I'd recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"My first ever experience here I ordered the classic burger. I waited for what seemed to be a reasonable amount of time for my food. The black guy came over and apologized for making me wait.(I didn't think I'd been waiting very long.) He then gave me two coupons and the food was delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So my mission to find a good blue cheese burger in Vegas continues now that Create is gone. [You can check out my review for Bottles & Burgers' blue cheese burger for another option] This is what I would get if I'm jones-in for a blue cheese burger and I don't have a lot of time. I made my own burger with the regular bun, onions, tomatoes, spinach, blue cheese, and spicy buffalo sauce. It was pretty damn good if I do say so. Has it ended the search? Not yet. Off to the Three Angry Wives next to try theirs. Until then my friends, stay hungry."}
{"text":"Just ate the avocado burger- hit the spot. Bacon on it was so tasty. And they were so friendly here. Well kept / clean. Shakes are bomb I got the peanut butter and jelly ( not on the menu) so good."}
{"text":"Love this place best burger in town always good fresh and ordered your way I go one a week if not more. The staff is first class and it is always clean and fresh. Take the time to go here"}
{"text":"I got there 10 minutes before closing and the servers turned me down when I got to register. They are so unprofessional. I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Super slow ordering process. Both chicken and sweet potato fries way too salty. Good idea now feels like franchise. Off my list."}
{"text":"Ok burger, ok fries.  Got there after 115 and the place looked like a tornado hit it.  The majority of the tables were a mess and not bussed.  I only saw one employee up front, so whoever was supposed to clean the place either wasn't there or wasn't doing their job.  Not a 3, not a 2...would give it a 2.5 if that were a choice."}
{"text":"The name Smash Burger reminded me of a cook angrily smashing the patties in the kitchen ;)

I went there twice already and finally decided to give a review:
 The burger is truly great, juicy, and you have a WIDE array of choices of toppings/sides  to put on it even though the menu looks simple. (for example, fried eggs ;) ) 

the rosemary garlic fries.....Mmmmm....sorry i was drooling thinking about it. It is divine to say the least.  

Customer service is great the both time I was there too. The price might seem a tad high for a burger place but it is worth every penny. 

TL;DR version: if you want an awesome burger, come here. If you want a quick fix of burger, go to In n Out.

hope this has been useful"}
{"text":"Burgers were good, the smash fries were nicely seasoned with a variety of seasonings.
The location is nice, it's right in the middle of the casino in ceasars palace."}
{"text":"We have been to this Smashburger at least ten times.  The food is good, but expensive.  If you order a salad, chances are it will not contain the ingredients on the menu.  In short, they don't know how to to make their own advertised salads at this location.  The goat cheese salad is amazing if they can get it right for you.  

On a recent trip, we were charged $1.00 more than the advertised menu price for each sandwich we ordered.  The unapologetic employee explained that Smashburger raised their prices but the menus were not updated. 

Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Been there a few times, good burgers. Nice to be able to choose size of patty. 
Took wife there and she is not a burger lover, but she tried the Avocado Club and enjoyed it. I had the mushroom Swiss which is usually excellent , but this time they must have seasoned it few times or the lid fell off!...Fortunately they serve beer, which helped wash the salt down! 
Service was good for the millennial group today- It could be just my age, but the new generation has to be the most relaxed working bunch I've ever seen- on the phone looking at the next beard style. 
Kudus to Brandon for working his butt off!"}
{"text":"Oh boy. I really wanted to like this place. The decor is the usual trendy fare with stainless steel this and that. The hipsters are sure to love it, very Chipotle-esque.

The food. Very, very disappointing. It sure did look like a gourmet, high-end burger but it managed to taste bleh. I think it was the toppings. I had the Bluegrass burger (this chain's attempt at regionalization) and it tasted awful! I'm still in disbelief! Did they not test this thing before putting it on the menu? I can't swear to it, but I think the \"cheddar\" they used on this thing was a cheese sauce. Really? On a $6 gourmet burger? If for some reason I'm mistaken and it was actually a slice of real cheddar cheese, I'm sorry they need to look for a different supplier. Cheese that doesn't taste like yak ass would be a good start.

My wife had the Spicy Baja burger. This was another bland, uninspired burger. The giant leaf of lettuce tasted very strong. I know it sounds weird but it tasted like yard work. It was better than the Bluegrass burger though (which isn't saying much). The fries... the fries. They offer something called smash fries. It's fries covered in oil, garlic and rosemary. This does not even sound good to me, that's why I ordered regular french fries. Guess what they brought to my table? Yep, smash fries. I figured what the heck. I tried one. Have you ever accidentally tasted ear wax? Yeah, that's how my taste buds reacted to that french fry mess.  I got my regular fries though and they couldn't have been any more generic. Think Steak n' Shake fries, just slightly thicker.

On the upside, the burger patty itself was good. It was cooked just the way I like it with just a hint of pink and plenty juicy. The big smash, which I thought was going to be two patties is actually one big (as in diameter) patty. With a patty this good and tasty, it's a shame they screwed up the rest of the burger.

This place has no soul. From the stock generic logo and Chipotle-wannabe look to the menu built by someone who obviously does not know burgers."}
{"text":"I wish there was one of these near Elyria, OH!!! On top of delicious burgers and fries, the customer service was far beyond what anyone might expect from a fast food joint. Seriously, I want to know who does their customer service training! AMAZING! Now, for the food... Day one: Truffle Mushroom Smashburger and Smashfries. The burger was sooooo good. Buttery bun, juicy burger, and one word for their skinny, seasoned fries - addicted! Day two: Spicy Baja Smashchicken and, of course, more fries! The burger was so good, I HAD to come back and try the chicken. Spicy was an understatement, it was HOT! Hot and delicious, and just as impressive as the burger. If I was in town a 3rd day, I would have eaten here again. Honestly, even if the food was subpar, I would have come back for the customer service. Customer service is so rare these days, and this place sets the bar high! I love it! (Oh, and free refills on fountain drinks - BONUS!)"}
{"text":"Made to order burgers. I don't recommend the smash fries, they are pretty oily. The smash burger 'big' is 1/2 pound and taste great, except the bun got a little soft from the patty. I might be back but I won't go with the big burger or the smash fries. I'll try the classic and see how that goes. 

The combo ran me $9 and change. Clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! I heart the spinach and goat cheese chicken sandwich! Oh my delicious.  I've had their burgers before and they are okay.  But boy do they have kick ass chicken burgers.  The other day I also tried their seasonal salted caramel milkshake! I died and gone to Haagen Daaz heaven.  I highly recommend this place and don't forget to get on their email list.  They have great deals sent to your email!"}
{"text":"My dad and I craved for a burger today and we found this place on the internet.  They had me at sliced jalapenos!! I loved the option of creating my own burger. SUPER AWESOME!! So I went with a chipotle bun, blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, jalapenos 1/3 burger!! It was devine, juicy, spicy and lovely :)
Although I wasn't fond of the haystack onion rings...a bit soggy :(
My dad got the Arizona Smashburger which made him sweat from the spicy habanero cheese and jalapeno combination.  Sweat is always a good sign with my dad!!
As for the dining ambiance, we got it to go but while I waited in the restaurant I was impressed with how clean the dining area was and the staff was friendly.  
Overall, I was impressed with Smashburger and would recommend their burger any day :)"}
{"text":"One of the few places you get a genuine welcome when you come In. Always encounter very friendly staff and management.  Food is great, is this a 5 star restaurant burger? Well no that's why it's $7 instead of $25. It hits the spot and is always filling. Personal fan of the haystack onions on the classic burger."}
{"text":"I eat here all of the time. it is a great place to eat. The staff are always friendly and the food comes out great. Today however is different. I had to repeat myself literally 4 times to the cashier whose name is River what I wanted. I am a bit upset because even after repeating myself those 4 times, my order was not complete. So I told him 2 more times once at the register I wanted the Large Smash fries. Now I am sitting here waiting for my order which is 12 minutes. Today was the worse service I ever received here. I gave the 5 star rating because of my previous experiences.  But if I did this today you would have received 1 star if I was a new customer. Train your people better."}
{"text":"The servers at this location are wonderful. The burgers are on the better end of the fast food chain and I love their Rosemary Sweet Potato fries. Yummy! Check it out."}
{"text":"First time at this particular Smashburger location. The service was friendly and attentive. Chatty staff, but not overly so. 

I came here with my mom and our food came out quickly after we ordered. My chicken was cooked well and was moist, but overly salty. Everything else was great and we were in and out for dinner in less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Yet another visit to a chain food spot saved by excellent customer service. The only reason my fella and I ended up at Smashburger was because we had a coupon. 

We walked up to the counter and took a while to decide what to order. I was being fickle as always and luckily the girl taking our order was patient and helpful answering all our questions. I decided on my order and then my fella put his order in and then, what do you know, I changed my mind about what I wanted. The girl was sweet and responded to my apologies that it was no trouble at all. 

When our order was ready she walked it out to us when we didn't hear our name being called. Her extra effort really made our experience that much better."}
{"text":"I saw the groupon for this place and since I'd been meaning to try it, I thought it was a good opportunity to do it for a reasonable price.

Honestly, I felt it was a little expensive for what you get., despite having my coupon. The burger was somewhat flavorless, for my taste. I was hoping for more seasoning or spice. I tried the sweet potato fries and the veggie frites. They were ok, but nothing to write home about.

I'm definitely willing to give this place another chance, but since I don't live particularly close to any of the locations, I'm in no rush. I'll probably try the Avocado Smashchicken or the Spicy Baja Smashburger."}
{"text":"This is for the manager.
Jan 6, 2015
Whatever ur whole crew was this day was horrible. 
Grumpy girl up front. Manager/guy bringing out food only came out with food.  Then when we asked for ranch he did not bring it out till my food came out. Which came out 10 min later ( because I met him there. And ordered later). So no extra steps there.  He was not walking around and checking on the customers in between orders. 
Once again this is more for owner, just for heads up on staff on duty that day. 
Cook was good. Food was up to par as usual."}
{"text":"I wish that I could say that my first experience with Smashburger was a smashing success, but alas I cannot!!  Have heard good things about this fast food burger chain.  Well, I can tell you that their branch at the food court in Caesars Palace Las Vegas did nothing to impress me.

All the food is served a la carte.  No discounted combo meals here.  Go up to the counter and pay at least $8.49 for your regular size burger.  Pay another $3.99 if you want fries, and $3.79 for a soda with unlimited refills.

I ordered their Classic Smash Burger and a side of their Smash Fries.  The fries had good flavor, and I would order it again.  The burger was good, but not worth the steep price.  It is more of a $5 burger at the most.  

I realize that the prices are probably higher here than their regular branches.  May try them again at one of their other locations in the future.  As for this specific location, no thanks.  Once is enough."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, but it was a bit crowded and messy.  I'd go back again if it looked slow but they seem to be a bit cramped.  Make sure you have enough napkins though for these burgers."}
{"text":"I have only been to Smashburger 3 times now but I am definitely a fan! I like the black bean burger patties and the rosemary and garlic Smashfries. My husband really likes the grilled chicken and my kiddo loves the burgers and fried pickles. Everything here is good and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get a hamburger but not location anymore. I ordered Az Arizona and it ended up being cold plus my so called smash fries didn't have the \"smash\" flavor like it suppose to have.   Totally disappointed in this place :-("}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place I had to come and check it out. Very speedy service and the oreo chocolate milkshake has become an instant hit!! Great fresh taste to burgers and smash fries are good!!"}
{"text":"If you want the best non sit-down restaurant burger ever, then this is where you go.  I am absolutely head over heels in love with Smashburger.  I was completely smitten when I first visited the one in Tempe a while ago, but the long distance relationship was just too much.  Now that Smashburger is closer to my 'hood, we can see each other more often. 

 We went for their VIP grand opening, and everything went surprisingly well!  They were utterly jam-packed but the crowd was appeased with shake samples while we waited for our free food.  Of course it was delicious.  You can't go wrong with the BBQ Bacon burger.

We have since been quite a few times, and they are consistent with the first.  I always get a delicious burger that is cooked well but still incredibly juicy.  The bacon actually adds to the burger in both texture and flavor.  The haystack onions really set this burger apart from the rest though.  They add flavor, texture, and a perfect savory finish to every bite.  I love the veggie fries, especially when I get lots of asparagus.  The olive oil rosemary fries have actually gotten better since the opening.  I think they have lightened up on the OO, which is a good idea.

Smashburger is pretty tight with me, although my pants don't appreciate it.  We'll have to see where our relationship goes once Smashburger moves in less than a mile from my house.  I hope I don't get too clingy."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue!  I actually first came here when they just opened, maybe even on the first day.  I absolutely loved it then, and I absolutely loved it again when we came for Office Hours!

Both times I have been here I have ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger and the Veggie Frites.  So far, at least to me, this is the best burger in the Valley.  They season their burgers so much that it tiptoes along the lines of overkill, but I like it.  The burger is always juicy and fresh and the toppings are killer.  The BBQ sauce is thick and sweet and the perfect complement to the salty bacon and fried onion strings sitting atop the meat.  This is really a fantastic burger.  The Veggie Frites are yummy, especially the asparagus because the tops of them get all crispy.  They serve them with a generous side of ranch.  Yum!

Obviously, I love this place.  I am soooo excited to get one of these so close to downtown, but that is going to be a very dangerous thing."}
{"text":"Was smashtastic, cooked well, fast and great service . Was welcomed inside and were patient when we were figuring out what we wanted."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had Smashburger and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it, but I remember my experience.  

I think if their whole concept and even store name revolves around the word \"Smash\", they should design their store to reflect that.  SHOW US THE SMASHING!!!  Five Guys & In-N-Out, who I would place together in the same category as Smashburger, both have exposed kitchens showing us how clean and freshly prepared their food is.  

Next, their burgers are really really greasy.  I think the best beef to fat ratio for a patty is 80/20.  I don't know what their ratios are, but just because they use 100% Angus beef, it shouldn't equate to more grease.  It should equate to more flavor.   And their 'highest-quality-cheeses\" wasn't anything special.   And I really really tasted.  I really did.

Their rosemary/olive oil fries adds another couple of bucks to your meal, which is north of 10$ dollars for a meal.  They're not as good as they sound.  Next time, I'll stick with the regular fries.  

I will go back to try again, but so far, Smashburger is just 2 1/2 stars in my book.  The rounding-up because I'm just nice. :D"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and tasty.  Every location I attend is the same consistent experience. 
Get the deep fried pickle!!!"}
{"text":"We always order the burger with bacon and top it off with a scrambled egg. The shakes are very good. Each time we go it seems to get better"}
{"text":"Great location to get to, good service and very prompt with the food.

Love the smash fries, bbq bacon burger with fried egg is delish. Try the oreo shake which is always a winner. The truffle mushroom burger is also a great choice. This is above the in n out burgers and is as good as the expensive gourmet burgers at half the price.

Place is very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"I come to this Smashburger way more than I need to. With that being said, my favorite dish is the classic smash with Turkey meat. The last few visits have been questionable. Before I start, I would just like say that the cashier Lychene is a very good worker and always gets the job done. On the other hand, her manager does the total opposite. The last 3 times I have come, the manager is doing absolutely nothing but talking to the cook while Lychene is stuck taking all of the orders and serving the food. Very unfair. Last week, I found a hair in my food and was very displeased. This restaurant needs work."}
{"text":"Nice burger place to welcome to the Park Rd. area... but then there's parking (lol). It's not the easiest to get in and out of this place, so peak times would not be recommended as a good time to try out the menu items. But if you're pressed, then you can always park over on the Viva Chicken side and walk over - try to respectful of the homes that are behind the place, as their driveways are not for your personal use (I've seen it happen). 

Everyone at this location was friendly, but be mindful of what you're ordering as it can get a little pricey if you aren't careful. For two burgers (no sides), two water cups came to about $18 (plus tax). Not worth the headache, for a snack but could be fulfilling with some fries. 

I will definitely try this place again, as there is an extensive menu of burger items to choose from (included black bean burgers). Go enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had the mushroom & Swiss burger which was delicious. I wasn't crazy about the sea salt fries tho. My hubby loved his Arizona burger and rosemary, garlic and olive oil fries. Overall, not bad at all!"}
{"text":"How does a burger place with bacon on every item run out of bacon? Poor management which leads me to question the rest of the food prep etc. It will be a while before I try this place again."}
{"text":"Everything here they made hot and fresh if you love burger this is the place. Service is nice food come out fast"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Felt welcome the moment my husband and I walked in. Carrie and Bella were very friendly. Food was great, excellent quality. Bacon cheeseburger no cheese and tomato lettuce.
And a classic no onion well done with garlic fries and a coke."}
{"text":"The service is awesome and the food is great. It is located right off the 101 and Elliot. Super easy to get here. I ordered a regular smash burger with Oreo milk shake along with fried sweet potatoes and fried onion as side dishes.  The meat on the burger is super tender and juicy. It makes burgers from McDonald doesnt look like food. Milk shake portion is super generous. Not only it is in a tall glass, they also give u extra on the side as well. The fried onion is a bit greasy but it is still delicious. Fried sweet potatoes was mouth watering. I will definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"At first, I was excited about a brand new smash burger opening up in Chandler...but unfortunately we end up walking out disappointed. 

First off, almost all tables there were not picked up when we walked in. We literally had to ask the cashier finding someone to pick up at least one table for us to sit in. Then, they ran out of folks in the general area. I had to, again, ask for a folk at the cashier. Kind of annoying. 

I ordered a avocado burger and the beef was a bit overcook. As for the Oreo milk shake....it was decent but water down. 

I will come back here again to try something else. I understand that it was a busy day when we came in. Hopefully it will improve next time we come back."}
{"text":"Good chain restaurant, salad was good proportions with meat added (Two dollars add on). Grilled Chicken burgers are good but a little watery, fried chicken is crispy. Smash fries are good with anything. Black bean burger is good but very soft and not really burger texture.

This location is attentive, friendly and new people tend to work with managers."}
{"text":"2nd to In-N-Out this is my favorite chain burger joint. The burgers are great, sweet potato fries & fried pickles are amazing, and they are one of very few fast food places that offer alcoholic beverages. The line moves quickly but seating is limited so be prepared to take your meal to go. Prices are a bit high, and there can sometimes be a wait to get your food which increases the risk of items not being as fresh or even arriving cold. Overall, worth going back again & again."}
{"text":"We love this place and the older lady that works the cashier is great and always nice, but this trip was kind of aggravating because of one of your employees Chloe.  She was terrible to watch... the place was full but not crazy busy and out of hand by any means.  It took her 3 mins to put 2 burgers in a bag to go.  There were table open but still had previous customers food left on them... she was so concerned with taking her time delivering other orders to clear tables for any waiting.  I finally had to clear my own table as she watched and then Chloe never offered to at least wipe it down.  This was disappointing"}
{"text":"Fun place to people watch at Desert Ridge! The assistant manager who took my order was very accommodating. I ordered the chipotle cobb salad and it was very good. What I would do differently is either get ranch dressing instead of chipotle or no blue cheese on it. The two together tasted very strange and clashed. Aside from that it was great! Their appetizers were very inexpensive so this is a good place to go if you are on a budget. They also sell Honest brewed tea which is my favorite bottled tea. I'll come back!"}
{"text":"For the price of the avocado burger there could have been more than 2 slices. 
The sin burger was good, the veggie fritters were greasy"}
{"text":"Totally not worth the hype. I thought it was not good. Took 24 mins to get a take out order. Not impressed good was dried out and not good wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Here's the thing....I'm a HUGE 5 Guys fan and I think I've found my new fav.  Smashburger was everything I had hoped it would be and more.  Basically....

- the burger was amazing. 
- the fries were amazing (had the oil and basil fries)
- the service was fast and friendly - delivery to your table is a nice touch
- the restaurant was very clean and well staffed 

What more can you ask for?  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. The flavor of the patty... Kind of gross. The put American on my sandwich and charged me for it when I clearly asked for cheddar. The smash sauce....mayo, mustard, relish. In that order. Not very good. My lunch is so blah."}
{"text":"Ordered our food to go. Both got different burgers to try, I got the veggie fries , my husband got the regular fries. Food was borderline edible and we both got sick shortly after eating. I was far sicker and violently vomited for hours after. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Long line with one register open.  Clueless.  Too bad since its good food.  They need to be more aware of the customer experience"}
{"text":"Decent service, poor kitchen delivery. They were out of caramel shake but they made it up and gave me an extra one. Still, my bad experience didn't end there. They messed up my order just like every other fast food joint. I have no idea how these people can't follow simple instructions. How mediocre are you?! I've lost all confidence in the food industry, sadly sometimes we don't have time to cook so we have to rely on tide-pod eating, condom-snoring millennials to cook our food. It's no longer sustainable. Thank you for ruining my meal."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since my first review, but just wanted to comment on the service. Mr. Silva is top notch, and was very accommodating. Food of course was excellent."}
{"text":"A group of us visited this Smashburger today for lunch.  I ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger and asked for extra BBQ either on the burger or on the side.  The woman at the counter look at me like I had just asked her the square root of 247258.  After her confused look, I acquiesced.  I also ordered the smashburger fries.

We grabbed a seat and the food came out relatively quickly.  My burger looked good but I was given regular fries instead of the Smashburger fries.  I didn't realize until I felt like it was too late to say something.  Someone else in our party didn't get the right type of fries also.  The plain fries were very bad and desperately needed some sort of seasoning.

The burger was ok but I thought mine was really dry.

I'll pass on Smashburger in the future."}
{"text":"I have eaten at other Smash burgers before with great results. Last night it seemed like the crew was off their game. We entered the store got in line with one person in front of us getting their order taken. When done we stepped up and then we did not exist anymore. The person behind the counter did everything but take our order or really acknowledge we were standing there. After several minutes we just left and went to another place to eat. There were two people who were up in front working and neither one did anything to help us."}
{"text":"Sadly my first Smashburger experience was an extreme dissapointment! Their customer service was horrible, the food was too salty, the surrounding tables were covered with trash, they screwed up our very simple order, and they didn't have any Tabasco. What burger joint doesn't have Tabasco? Obviously Smashburger. Perhaps we were there on an off day based on all the other reviews they received, but either way I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Foods not bad but the price is just insane. I can get a much bigger and better burger in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Conveniently located off the 101 or the I10 on 99th and McDowell is a restaurant called Smash Burger. This restaurant puts a modern day look and feel to an old classic style burger stop shop. The seating environment was decent considering the amount of service during the dinner hours consisting of booths and tables, and the customers even had the choice of sitting outside as well. The place did have a welcoming aroma somewhat like a backyard grill smell. At first glance the restaurant looked pretty clean, but taking a closer look at the tables that had a greasy type texture that remained from previous customers made it seem otherwise. The menu had a vast amount of options to choose from, whether you wanted a beef burger, chicken burger, veggie burger, or even a simple salad was not out of reach. This restaurant is a little on the expensive side of things when it comes to the portion size as well as the quality of food. The fries themselves were overly greasy and doused with seasoning, and the burger itself was juicy and contained fresh ingredients but the patty seemed small. All the food here is made to order and is hand delivered to each table in an expedient manner with excellent customer service. I would say overall from my experience even though the service was inviting the price, environment, and quality of food make this restaurant a not a number one choice. The food itself is not worth the price as well as the cleanliness of the restaurant make it a very unattractive location for friends or family."}
{"text":"1st time here and the service was amazing! Next time I'm in Vegas I will go back! the food was yummy and fulfilling."}
