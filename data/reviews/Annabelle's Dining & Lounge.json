{"text":"The karaoke on Tuesdays and Fridays at 6 is great, but there's something wrong with the plumbing adjacent to the restaurant.  The hallway right there constantly smells like a latrine.  This has been going on for at least 3 months.   Management must repair this soon, or the whole place will get reputation as a dump."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I usually go for the karoke on Fridays and have tried several things on the menu and would not recommend any of them. Many times they are \"out of\" a particular item on the menu. Tonight I had dinner before I went to karaoke, and was told by the waitress \"the tables are for paying customers only\".  I will never be back!"}
{"text":"We had eaten here once last season and it was excellent.  Decided to take hubby there for his birthday dinner.  We both had excellent meals and could not be happier. His steak was tender with a delicious port sauce over it.  I had the chicken pasta dish with a sauce that was delicious.  Has a very knowledgable waitress, Lynn, and very efficient lady.  You will not be disappointed with your meal.... or your waitress."}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews, so much so that when I have a bad experience, I normally just don't write a review. 
But this was just nuts. 
Brought my whole family here tonight for my parent's anniversary dinner, 7 adults and 3 kids. I happen to work across the street from this restaurant and thought it would be good to give it a try. And it was rated so well on Yelp!!
We get here and are seated quickly thanks to our reservation.
We get waters from the nice bussers, but it ends up being about 20 minutes before someone comes around to take any drink order. Red flag numero uno. 
From then on, it's just one catastrophic circumstance after another. 
*Apparently, as we were informed later on in the night, they only had ONE chef, although they had taken at least 4 reservations that we could see for parties of 10+. 
*Also, there was no manager on duty. At all. On a weekend night, no less. 
*Our server was brand new. She was very nice, and apologetic for the disaster that was our dining experience. Which we let her know was none of her fault. How the management thought it a good idea to throw a brand new server on for large parties with no help is beyond me. 
*They were basically out of everything. If you google the menu, you will notice there is not an extensive list of options. Great, fine with us. But when four different people at our table are told that the selections they've made are out tonight (including my son's pick of MAC & CHEESE), then that's just unacceptable and further illustration of the poor management. 
Due to all of these events and the unimaginable wait time between any kind of event (30-40 minutes between ordering and receiving anything, including drinks), we were pretty irritated by the end of our meal. 
Added to that stress, the elderly table of 6 next to us was at the tale end of their similar experience, which lead them to complain quite loudly and argue at the table with a rather rude brunette server who was acting as a manager type and hearing them vent. After which, they started to ask our table if we were satisfied and having as bad a night as them. Ugh. 
I will say that at the end of our meal, after my little brother (who has been a bartender for 6 years and was FUMING) tracked down a bartender named Ruben, we were finally given an explanation (ill managed and unprepared) and apology, and were taken care of for out trouble. Ruben was very nice, and had great customer service skills. And although we were nice and smiled through the whole ordeal, I felt bad that he had to face the brunt of all the angry patrons that night, which from my count, was everyone in the restaurant. He's the reason there is an extra star in this review. 
Ugh. On advice per Ruben, I may try and muster up the gall to give this place another chance, provided on a different day and only with the server he suggested. 
But, we have all been warned..."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times - mainly in the bar/lounge area.  The restaurant just recently rolled out a new menu, which I was pleased with.  It sounded like they were working out some kinks with the new menu, but nothing that sacrificed quality or service.  Their new shrimp tacos on corn tortillas are awesome.  Don't feel shy to change your sides - as this girl loves her fruit.

Go on a Monday, Wednesday or Thursday night for karaoke.  The host is not only really talented, but a super nice guy.  He makes he round and knows your name by the end of the night.  BTW, it starts early and ends at 10pm.  Needless to say, especially on a school night, I appreciate the hours.    

I look forward to going back and singing my heart out on a karaoke night!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was OK for karaoke. Since it was a restaurant thought we would get the corn beef and cabbage on St. Patty's night. Can't sit in the booths, too broken down, definitely need tables there instead. Sat at high table that needed to be wiped down. Blek! 
Only $12 a plate but geez, 3oz piece of corn beef, half of potato, too mushy to tell, 1 slice of carrot and couldn't see the cabbage. Was mushy with the potato. Good thing out of this meal, even though it was very greasy, it was tasty!
Had to BEG for rolls or bread.  Don't trust them don't think I'll eat there again."}
{"text":"We have been here for one hour. There is under 20 diners in the restaurant and are still waiting for our dinner. There are 5 of us. Finally received Luke warm dinner. Ordered a margarita and actually had to call the bar and ask when I would receive my drink after waiting ten minutes for it."}
{"text":"OK; I know I am a non-learner, but this time I mean it!!  This is the last time I go to this place.  We went for dinner last night because we felt that we could have a nice Xmas Eve dinner here.  Well, it was OK, but far from what I wanted or expected.  Let me begin by telling you that they have been advertising that they have a new chef with a new menu that is great!  NOT!!

I call to make reservations for dinner and ask if Annabelle's Restaurant is open for dinner since the last time I went, I called and was told \"yes\" but in fact the restaurant was closed and we had to eat in the coffee shop.  I was again told yes.  I also ask if the menu is the same as what is showing on the website and I am told yes.

We get there and order a couple of cocktails and start to peruse the menu.  First thing I notice is that there are no appetizers on the menu except for shrimp cocktail.  WTF?  Are you kidding me?  What kind of semi-fine dining restaurant has no appetizers?  And the rest of the menu bears no resemblance to what is shown of their website.  WTF?  So I ask if we can order from both the coffee shop menu as well as the restaurant's menu and they tell me yes.  That is a relief since I ordered some onion rings with some smoked chipolte dipping sauce and some nachos with chicken -- both appetizers are pretty good.

There are four of us and we order as our dinners chicken ala king over angel hair pasta, chicken marsala, shrimp scampi, and a NY cut steak.  The dinners are MEH at best and they have no french fries or baked potato for my steak.  They do have mashed potatoes, but I am not a mashed potatoes fan.

Salad of mixed greens and Caesar salad are fine.  

But the dessert menu is pathetic and only one of us orders dessert -- a chocolate lava cake that looks like a Mac truck ran over a chocolate cupcake and they scrapped it of the road.

The bill is $150 for four of us --- not expensive, but not cheap either.  But I think I can do better at another restaurant.

So today, I am cooking/making (with my girlfriend) our Xmas day dinner for the family.  It will be super good.  If anyone is interested, send me a message or email and I will tell you what we are having."}
{"text":"We went for Easter Brunch.  We had reservations for 2:00 but they started pulling the food at 3:00.  The food was just ok."}
{"text":"I had not eaten at Anna's in a number of years because of the decline in the quality of food and service. After reading that the resort had changed ownership we decided to give give the restaurant a second chance. BIG MISTAKE. While the menu was more limited, the selections sounded appealing so I ordered the beef short ribs for $24. What I got was ONE short rib which was mostly bone and fat served over a small mound of mashed potatoes with two thin carrots covered with gravy. I won't be returning to Anna's any time soon.  There are plenty of other restaurants in that area with better food at much more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I grabbed a very late lunch in the Anna's lounge portion and was pleased. Service was very friendly and efficient. It seems the place is stacked with regulars coming off of the course.

They have a few good beers on tap like Kilt Lifter, so you can't complain. Their scotch selection looks very good, but it also looks like the kind of place that may not sell a ton of the good stuff and thus let it go past its prime easily. Yes, liquor has a prime when it's opened. 

I simply got a diet coke, which was refilled quickly, and a club sandwich with fries. The fries were only okay - standard, slightly oily but hit the spot. The club sandwich was quite tasty, and had all of the essentials. Perfectly adequate sandwich.

I don't have anything bad to say whatsoever, but I also cannot praise it because I had a pretty simple meal."}
{"text":"Brunch was fabulous. We heard this was the first week for there Sunday brunch and that they have a new Chef.  Chef Eddie. Had an eggs Benedict station omelette station prime rib a Desert station A lot of fresh fruit and salad  they also had sausage and bacon scrambled eggs and  we had eggs Benedict the prime rib with mimosas and loved it. We will be back for sure   The service was impeccable the staff was very friendly made us feel very welcome Amanda was wonderful"}
{"text":"Had the chicken Marsala and it was disgusting. It all was about the same quality as hospital food.  Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"We are in the lounge this visit.  The food is so so.  I had the heirloom tomato and mozzarella bruschetta ok but not fabulous.   My husband had the dagwood sandwich with fries and said it was great.  I had creme brulee for dessert.  The custard was tasty but no flamed sugar crust.  My husband had the cheesecake and said it was very good. 

So why 4 stars when the food is just ok?  Here we go:

The service is amazing!  Fast, friendly & efficient.  The drinks are fabulous.   The place has a comfy,  laid back feel and they have live entertainment several nights a week.   The night we came they had the cheesiest lounge lizard.   What a blast!  Seriously,  give it a try."}
