{"text":"Very cozy, friendly warm place.
Nothing too fancy but everything is tasteful and carefully selected. 
From decoration and food presentation to fresh ingredients.
Nothing negative to comment on food, everything I have tried is very good - ok might have a enjoyed a slightly bigger portion but not bad anyways.
A must if you are living close by, one of the best options in the neighborhood for a friendly or family gathering."}
{"text":"First impression: Cosy place and a friendly staff
Food impression : Fresh, good portions and a wide variety of otpins
The Catch: Its quite pricey for very traditional style sushi"}
{"text":"So in spite of being really 2 minutes away from this place for years now, I am embarrassed to say this is the first time I have tried it.  And for the amount of sushi my team eats, that is like saying you're a sports fan, and have never heard of Michael Jordan (please don't ask who that is). 

So like we always do, we rolled in for lunch, 12-deep - without a reservation (like a boss?).   They somehow accommodated us, and were very nice.   Despite an understandable slight delay in getting all of our food, service was great.  Everything was pretty much as good as it gets.   Since we were a big group, I tried just about everything on the menu (seriously), but my favorites:
- Seaweed salad (very fresh, and covered in perfectly-ripe avocado)
- CRAZY-good (like Britney or Tyson crazy) Dragon rolls.   I recommend the Red Dragon
- very fresh sashimi

Only knock - wasn't a fan of the sushi pizza.   Too much roe.  

Try this place.  And not only because they are the only respectable sushi place left on this block.   Seriously - there are a LOT of \"conditional\" health inspections around these parts."}
{"text":"Ate here about a year ago when we visited Toronto.  We were with a large group and ordered one of the large sushi boats.  We liked everything, especially the spicy salmon rolls, and the presentation was fantastic. When we return to Toronto we will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Great place. I had a bento box and everything tasted great. I went on a Friday night and the place was empty so service was pretty fast."}
{"text":"Delicious! We got the love boat and it had 4 kinds of fresh sashimi, some nigiri and rolls (california and spicy salmon). Cali rolls had thick cut cucumber that delightfully crunched and the spicy salmon was so good! Everything tasted very fresh. They use less rice and provide thicker cuts and more fish in general. Love!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, Friendly staff, Cozy place!!

The best sushi in Toronto! Especially I loved the quality of food - it was so fresh, and so delicious!! My friend and I ordered Suki boat, Dynamite rolls, Teriyaki Salmon, and more. My favorite from this place is spicy salmon. To be honest, all of the sushi and rolls taste really good, and I love how fresh the fishes are! 
Their spicy salmon is quite unique compared to other place, and certainly they have the best one. 
Their service is very friendly and I always feel welcomed! I can assure this is one of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's one of the best sushi places in the city. Outstanding teryaki!!!"}
{"text":"I love this cozy restaurant. 
Staffs are always super friendly. They remember their regulars. The quality of the food is excellent. There's a wide variety of rolls, nigiri, sashimi and combos to chose from. I personally think their sushi rolls are the best in Toronto. Try spicy salmon roll. It is always so fresh and yummy, one my favourite on the menu."}
{"text":"Great sushi place with plenty to offer. 

Specifically:

Miso soup -  whenever I visit a new sushi place, I always try their miso soup. Sadly, this was my least favourite part of the meal. I found it too salty and lacking that umami flavour that good miso soup has. 

Sushi - decent California rolls as part of my combo, but nothing that sets them apart. Will need to try their other rolls but can't say they really stood out. 

Sashimi - Now we're talking! The sashimi was excellent. Melt in your mouth, fresh, delictable pieces of fish. Could've eaten a dozen more. Definitely the star in my meal.

Would recommend, just for the sashimi alone."}
{"text":"This is still by far my favourite sushi place in the city.  Sushi here is just always so fresh and delicious.  I order lunch from here on a regular basis.  The pricing is good, the food quality is great.  The staff are friendly and courteous.  Service can be a bit slow during lunch hour, but that is pretty typical for the area.  I've been to many downtown sushi places that are good...but nothing beats Suki!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood. I often go there to take out. I ate there only once. During the summer they have outside seats and tables. Daytime and night time, the atmosphere is very different. Daytime, this was a sushi restaurant and night time this was like a bar. The service is good usually. The foods are good, too. When I was eating inside, the waitress was acting like a teacher. I do not think it was bad, but I think it was strange. She explained what she brought to us. When she served miso soup, she said this was miso soup and it was a tasty soup. When she served a bowl of salad, she said this was salad and this was good for me. When she served Sushi, she said this is called sushi. I ordered sushi because I knew what Sushi was. That was funny."}
{"text":"For me, this is a rather average sushi restaurant. I feel like the fish is pretty fresh here, but it isn't anything that made me go: WOW.

For that, it gets 4 stars, but not 5. It's a solid place to eat at.

The miso soup tastes like there is MSG in it, and was very good as a result. I also took the Teriyaki Chicken Bento which was pretty yummy even though I hate California rolls, refused to eat the salad covered in their odd dressing (as I always do), and just had the chicken (breast) which was a bit dry but tasty nonetheless.

The salmon nigiri rolls  had were fresh, and I can't really complain about the place, as it has a higher standard of sushi than most average sushi places."}
{"text":"I'm glad that Suki is just around the corner. I'm not always a huge sushi fan but my friends are always pleased with the rolls they order, which look beautiful.  They make the best unagi don I've had in the city. Yum."}
{"text":"The most amazing and delicious spicy salmon and spicy tuna maki I've ever had! They even give you free crab salad if you stay in! A must must check."}
{"text":"Good prices and good sashimi.  

I got sashimis and was surprised by the quantity and quality for a fair price. 

Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in the area. Small family place with a cozy atmosphere and great food. Love their spicy salmon or tuna rolls."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! Very tasty and authentic! however, make sure you can wait at least 30 min, the service is pretty low once it looks like a family business and they don't know much how to manage the delivers."}
{"text":"Despite walking in the Yonge/St. Clair area often, I had never seen this restaurant but was really excited to try it.

I ordered the Osaka sushi combo for 16.95 which included 8 pieces of sushi and a salmon roll.  The combo came with a miso soup.
The sushi was excellent and well-seasoned.  However, there was way too much wasabi in the sushi - and my sinuses were instantly cleared!

The owner was very friendly, but I have to say that even though the restaurant only had 4-5 tables occupied, the service was so slow.  It took her 20 minutes to take our order, and if you're in a hurry I wouldn't recommend coming here.
Even though it seemed like she was running around everywhere, she wasn't very efficient.
I know this has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, but there was a family with a young child who kept screaming.  It was really annoying.  While we all realize that young children cry occasionally, this was constant screaming.    

Also, at other Korean-owned Japanese restaurants, sometimes they give you free appetizers like edamame.  But here, we weren't given anything.

At the end of the meal I was still really hungry.  So despite having exceptional quality, if I were to come back, I wouldn't order the sushi, probably something like a bento box (approximately 20-22$ for dinner).

Overall though, the Yonge/St. Clair area has some great Japanese food!"}
{"text":"This is a great Japanese restaurant in midtown Toronto.  I often avoid sushi restaurants that are not high end, for health reasons, but this restaurant only serves fresh, well cut fish!  The atmosphere is simple, tasteful and warm.  The owners and staff are very gracious hosts!  Nothing fancy here - just high quality Japanese food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi takeout place in the area.  Super friendly staff, fast service, consistent quality.  Always leaving me craving for more after the last bite."}
{"text":"Living nearby, this has become my regular haunt. Fresh fish coupled with the chef's personal creations, this place is a hidden gem in this neighbourhood. Their love boat is the best deal for two. Great service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service and some of the best quality sushi I've ever had!  Prices are pretty reasonable, considering the area. Definitely my go-to Japanese lunch spot."}
{"text":"A really good sushi place with lovely service. It was my first time here but the other people I was with had gone numerous times. Our server remembered orders from last time! Their lunch menu is full of great deals. I was especially happy selecting from the Bento Box choices because those also came with soup, salad, a few rolls and a meat of your choice. Just right for lunch! I would definitely come back here for my sushi fix when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"The sushi was good but the place is really expensive for what it is. We ordered
2 avocado rolls 
1 spicy salmon roll
2 vegetarian combos 
And it was $65 .... We had water and the service was pretty bad, I don't think it's worth it for what we had."}
{"text":"Good sushi, but I don't like the sauce they slather on the sashimi (feels like they are trying to hide something), and the proportions are quite small."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Shared the loveboat sushi with hubby and we both loved everything on it. Small place, good, attentive customer service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had a sashimi dinner at Suki expecting something above average due to the superb reviews and feedback, what a disappointment it was for me personally or either I had too greater of an expectation. When my friend and I arrived, we were the only customers, yet service was almost non existent. Food alone would made it average at its best. Price isn't cheap and will not get much money's worth. Not planning to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi at a decent price! Although I wish the servings were a bit larger. Love their spicy crab salad, I find myself ordering it every time I go here for lunch. The staff is quite friendly, and the interior seems to be well kept."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Vancouver, I know good sushi when I taste it! Like every authentic japanese restaurant, you are greeted by \"Ohayo Gozaimasu\" when you enter. Just from hearing the owners converse, you can tell they were from Japan which got me excited!

The experience first starts with 3 side dishes , the miso soup, the pastry and the salad, which were all were quite nice. Finally the main course arrived! The sashimi was incredibly fresh and flavourful. It would be rude to not take the time to enjoy each piece as it melts in your mouth. The spicy salmon was perfect as well as it was not overly spicy allowing you taste the freshness of the salmon.

Absolutely delicious and highly recommended! The best place to eat if you are looking for a restaurant to go to around Yonge and St. Clair West. Well deserved 5 stars!"}
