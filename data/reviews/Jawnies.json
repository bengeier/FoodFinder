{"text":"The first time I dropped by this restaurant I ordered the egg breakfast and the toast was mouldy. I never finished the meal and left never to return. 1 star is probably more than it deserves."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast Sunday. What you order from the menu on the place mats is not what gets served. The over easy eggs were completely without taste, the potatoes were soggy with little seasoning, the sausage was crisp on one side (the way Iike them) but mealy on the inside. The toast was good, and some of the fruit was edible. For a breakfast under 10 bucks, it will fill you up but I didn't walk away satisfied. Meh..."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give this place a 0. That's how bad it is....And if you look at my reviews in general, you'll see that I'm generally very satisfied with things, so this place was a definite no-no.  We went here for brunch last weekend and it was an utmost disaster. The food is UBER greasy (and not in a good way), and the service was quite bad. Not to mention, although I had a very clear conversation with our hostess about substituting potatoes with tomatoes, and omitting certain things from my dish, I ended up with something exactly the opposite and definitely not even the item I ordered. When I asked her if maybe she made a mistake/brought out the wrong plate, she got defensive and said that this was *exactly* what I ordered in what was basically a \"too bad so sad\" attitude.  Needless to say, I didn't leave much of a tip. Good thing I even paid for that not eaten meal.  Nothing irks me more than horrific service, and that's pretty much what you'll get here. That, and a stomach ache. :|"}
{"text":"Jawnies has been an exercise in 'how to let your standards slide'   I have been going on and off for about 15 years. The restaurant has changed hands three times in that period and with each new owner came good and bad.  This latest owner has ushered in the era of NEVER AGAIN for me! At first I had been optimistic because the place started to look cleaner. It is unfortunate, that with the slightly cleaner environment, came a big decrease in the quality of the food and service. Don't get me wrong! This place was never a 5 star but I would have given it at least 2 to 3 because it was in my neighborhood and the waitresses were quite friendly. The new owner got rid of the more friendly and competent staff and the place is left with a few who try their best and others that are completely rude and difficult.    The food has always been kinda Meh, but now it is down right embarrassing to let people know you eat there. Nothing is done properly! Order a chicken burger, and you get a microwave de-thawed hunk of chicken, that is rubbery and just plain gross. Breakfast, my fave meal of the day, is prepared with the care and finesse of a garbage man performing his/her duties. And FORGET any special instructions...they will be completely ignored. I have tried over and over to get them to make a plate of eggs the way I want them. No success! I actually thought that it was a difficult order until I went to a place where they made them correctly the first and every time there after. So Jawnies, I bid you Adieu! Nostalgia is no longer a good enough reason for me to waste my money."}
{"text":"This is a sad review to write as a lot of my childhood memories consist of ordering from this restaurant with my grandparents. It used to be fantastic! However, it is now under new management and has completely gone down hill (and I mean way, way, way down hill). Under the new management, I would give this restaurant negative stars if I could.   We started noticing a difference in their pizza (which I used to rave about to everyone I know). The sauce became watery and the pizza had no more flavour.   Just recently I ordered a chicken pita for delivery and while it started off by tasting quite good, one bite resulted in me chewing on a nice long bone. I'm not one to complain to a restaurant/company but I had to call them about this. When I did, initially I was offered my next order of a chicken pita for free.. Seeing as I only ordered from them every couple of months (and won't be doing so ever again), I told them that wouldn't work. They then offered to deliver a brand new chicken pita. Although my appetite had pretty much disappeared, I felt I was deserving of a new one and accepted. Unfortunately, the new one they delivered was pork. Oh, and I was charged extra for using my debit card.   I'm absolutely done with this restaurant. Old Jawnie's, you are sorely missed."}
{"text":"I think they are still trying to work out the kinks, so see the comment at the end of this review.   Unfortunately, The cheese used for the pizza which made it a 4 star on that front is no longer. Now it's that runny goo that I'm not so sure is even real cheese. I hope they will change it back to the way it was, cause the taste and price were right for those dreary rainy nights when you need to use the pizza box as an umbrella.  Honourable mention to their giant portion of home made cabbage rolls, which could have fed a family of 4, but due to the density of the dish, were not warmed all the way through and needed more marinara sauce to wash them down. The flavour was quite unique and savory.   All-in-all, I'm rooting for them to tilt the quality see-saw the way of better quality, not worse."}
