{"text":"They sell paan for $2 and if you want something extra on that they'll charge more. So if you want the real paan including surti or something they'll charge for small amount of surti and they'll add that amount on every paan you are about to buy. Say if you want 5 paan then they'll add $5 above $10(for paan) just for a little amount of surti. My dad is fond of paan so I had to buy it from this place but they are looters"}

Royal Paan Rexdale

Royal Paan Rexdale is our LAST stop for our November Food Crawl!

Royal Paan is in an area I hardly frequent.. especially at night! GPS took me to this strip plaza, the only one in the intersection that were packed with parked car. Smell of spices and curries so thick in the air....

I just cannot eat anymore...... KO for the night but then I saw a DVD store.. My Yelp Friend last stop is for me to look at  Bollywood DVDs? What were all these men doing lining up for what?

Paan is a tradition practice of chewing betel leafs with areca nut and slaked lime paste. Paan is claimed to be chewed as a palate cleanser, a breath freshener, and for digestive purposes.* That's sounded like a perfect ending to our Food Crawl....

But chewing leafs was the last thing I had in my mind when I saw all the pictures of Lassi and Falooda......

Royal Falooda ($3.49) 
- Falooda is an adaptation of the non-liquid Persian dessert Faloodeh
- a hint of rose syrup with vermicelli and jello and ice cream sprinkled with grounded pistachio
- drinking this liquid dessert through a jumbo straw remind me of Vietnamese iced drink experience!

Royal Lassi ($2.99)
- taste similar to the Royal Falooda but it just a yogurty drink with Rosewater syrup...
- I told my Yelp Friend drink up that's good for him! 

What a \"Royal\" Ending for our November Crawl! 

Until the NEXT one!!
