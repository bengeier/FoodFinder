{"text":"This is a place I always come to knowing I will have an excellent time. Easily some of the best brunch in the city, and at a frankly insane price for all the offerings they have.  Have coffee while you inevitably wait in the antique store that accompanies the restaurant - find weird porcelain figurines, dresses with the fiercest of shoulder pads, and practice your skills with an old etch-a-sketch while sitting on a couch that probably belonged to your grandmother.  I typically go for the more breakfast-y options on the entree menu, and the only suitable word I can describe the pancakes as is dank - almond and lemon are memorable standouts. They do a lot of good things with the seitan and tofu dishes as well. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but eating like this could maybe (not really) convert me.  Most of the time I don't even have the stomach room for the pies/cakes by the end, but somehow I will find a way to taste something. I rarely leave this place without a well deserved stomach ache.  It draws a variety of people, but definitely has a large clientele that likes to brag about how they come here every Sunday like they're racking up cool points. But it's absolutely unique and a must-go for anyone who likes hummus and peanut noodles."}
{"text":"I've only been here on Sundays for brunch, but i'll speak on behalf of the buffet. It's impressive, affordable, and delicious. Even if you're a meat eater like myself, you'll enjoy it. Great staff, atmosphere. I wish i knew what kind of coffee they serve because, in my opinion, it's one of the best cups of coffee to get in the city."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat in southside on a Sunday and decided on this place because of all the great reviews. As soon as we walked into this stinky thrift store I thought about turning around to try some place else, but I trusted fellow yelp reviewers and we sat down. The food was AWFUL- I can't believe it when I read all these great reviews. What am I missing? We got the Polamalu wrap- I couldn't get through more than a few bites. As for the buffet, I tried almost everything I could and didn't like any of it- and I don't consider myself a picky eater by ANY means. Very disappointed and puzzled as to why this terrible place got such positive reviews. Don't bother going here..."}
{"text":"Urgh. Not a fan. Being vegan, I was psyched to hear about this place and definitely wanted to check out their Sunday brunch. However, I was supremely disappointed. For starters, I get that the vibe is laid back and all, but in my eyes everything just came off as messy! I am by no means a neat freak but when I eat I do like to feel like i'm in a clean environment...and I just didn't. The buffet was underwhelming...random foods (which were bland and didn't seem to relate to one another in any way) thrown sloppily into bowls...and very little actual \"brunch\" items. Also, super noisy and just a feeling of chaos was in the air the whole time. The only cool part was the thrift store in the front."}
{"text":"Boy did this place give me the heebie-jeebies!!!  Talk about a real life version of American Horror Story.  You walk in and half-expect Jessica Lange to jump out behind the clothing racks on the side of the foyer wearing an old wedding dress and wielding a chain saw.  Me and my reluctant, non-vegan boyfriend arrived here at 11:30am on a Saturday, just as they opened.  The front part of the restaurant is basically an untouched, vintage thrift shop from the 1980's.  There were racks of old clothes, household decor, and a randomly placed jewelry display case.  Once you rummage through all that old crap, you get to the dining hall, which smelled strangely enough like a vintage car burning diesel fuel inside of a closed garage.  The decoration was a hoarders paradise -  years of collecting old crap from the Goodwill across the street on East Carson.  The waitstaff, again, reminded us of American Horror Story.  They were slow even though we were the only people in the restaurant from the time we got there to the time we left (11:30-1), but had suspiciously cheery attitudes and made sure we had enough coffee...very suspicious indeed!  The food was actually a delight.  We shared the Greek platter as an appetizer.  None of it was homemade, we could tell, but it didn't taste bad.  My boyfriend got the sweet potato burger which tasted like maple syrup, in a good way.  I ordered the curry chick pea burrito which was rich and filling.  The zenith of our meal was actually not being poisoned or tortured!  Food was good, environment was weird - 7/10."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite place altogether in Pittsburgh! It's definitely hands down favorite brunch place.   Sunday deal: $10 for one entree, one drink, cold appetizers buffet, cake buffet  The food tastes SO GOOD! The cold appetizer buffet is the absolute best with all kinds of yummy salads, pastas, hummus, and fresh goodness. And the cakes are so so perfect as well... very obviously baked in the past day and not smothered in frosting just perfectly sweet.   Something about all their food just leaves you with a clean feeling as you leave. Sure you might be bloated from stuffing your face but it's all good for you food and so fresh at that."}
{"text":"Pros: -Good, healthy food -Great Sunday buffet (buffet is mostly vegan, with the occasional exception of a dessert that might have honey...the entrees that you order have vegan and vegetarian options) -The Sunday buffet is a VERY good value. It comes out to about $12, and you get TONS of food. You get to order an entree from the menu (changes every time), free unlimited hot/iced tea or coffee, PLUS the all you can eat buffet. -The Sunday buffet has about 8 different desserts -I went there for Thanksgiving dinner last year, and the food was very good, but kind of pricy -As a vegan, it's great to have so much selection. -They have a large variety of flavored teas that are very good. I don't usually care for flavored tea, but I really like the ones I've tried there.  Cons: -Very crowded on Sundays during the buffet; you share tables with other people -If you eat there often the food begins to all taste the same -The Sunday buffet desserts are mostly cakes, and they are OK....they don't have enough icing and they taste VERY similar  That being said...I DO recommend this place. The food is great, but overall it is just good."}
{"text":"Okay, maybe I should have known better than to go to this super-vegan friendly place for brunch with my vegan friends.  But I would LOVE to think that I could be vegan...  If only I wasn't allergic to soy!  (We're talking I-may-need-that-epi-pen-that-I-don't-carry-around kind of allergy.  Haven't gotten there yet, but unfortunately, the allergy gets worse and worse.  :(  And I'm Asian.  Kinda sad, I know.)  What I did eat before I needed to stop, was yummy!  This place is great, seriously.  Wish I could go back!  I always shed a little tear when everyone else goes...  and leaves me behind.  For my own good."}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews about this place I decided to give it a try. I had only read briefly that it offered some delicious, fresh vegetarian dishes and was a cool, new atmosphere that I probably hadn't experienced before.  Both of the things that I heard about this place were accurate. And for only 10 bucks, the amount of food and the quality of it were both worth it.  One thing that I actually really enjoyed about the restaurant is that you get seated with random people. If I were asked this at any other restaurant I would definitely feel weird about it, but here it seemed just right. My friend and I agreed, and were happy to sit next to two ladies who had been there many many times and had recommendations on what we should get. I opted for the eggs with zucchini, and my friend got the french toast...both of which were much better than I'm used to getting at any breakfast restaurant.   The buffet was pretty good, and I really enjoyed most of the vegan desserts. There was a cookie flavored cake that I thought was extremely good. The coffee was better than most breakfast places as well.   I will definitely be returning to this place for breakfast. The only thing that I would like more would be if there were more variety at the salad bar, as it was pretty one note."}
{"text":"This \"Hipster Cracker Barrel,\" as an out-of-town friend described it, is mostly a fun gathering place for 'burgher veg heads. I only go for Sunday brunch; the desserts are great and the atmosphere is fun and, well, antique, but the actual food is just OK (go early, or yours might be nuked)."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to eat brunch on Sundays! This place is one of a kind - it's a restaurant inside an antique shop! I really like that they fill up empty chairs at tables by seating strangers next to each other. (They do ask if you mind first, which is nice.) They have a large assortment of teas, all vegetarian food - though they do use real eggs - fun, quirky atmosphere.   Here's how it goes for Sunday brunch:  1. You get there early if you don't want to wait, but if you don't get there early you get to pass the time looking through the antique shop until they call your name. 2. You sit next to strangers at a table, choose your entree from a small menu, and choose your beverage. 3. After telling the waiter your order, you get up and go to the sidebar for the buffet, which all seems healthy whether or not it is. And it's delicious. 4. You eat everything and, if you haven't already, you get back up and go to the table piled high with bunt cakes of all varieties! Don't be fooled by the \"hot chocolate\" one! It's \"hot\" as in \"spicy\" chocolate.  The entire meal is about $11. There is always street parking available. On Sundays at any rate. Highly recommend.  One warning: The eggs were ridiculously salty when I got them. I have just avoided them since that experience, so I don't know if that's typical or if the shaker just fell into the batch that day."}
{"text":"I love Zenith! I haven't been down in an age, but when I think of my favorite spots in the city, this is definitely one of them. I took my parents here for their buffet brunch when I'd had it with the shortlist of available options in Pittsburgh (either a chain or WAY expensive) and even they enjoyed it. There is never a long list of options for hot entree but guaranteed you'll still have a tough time deciding. The decor is unlike anything else in PGH - fronted by a rummage friendly antique store.  You almost feel like you're walking into a surprisingly cozy back stockroom to eat with the owners.  I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, but Zenith usually makes me feel like I easily could become one and not miss too much!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I am an avid meat eater, but I love Zenith. Best brunch place in PGH and although delish! The Sunday brunch is insane. You get and entree and a drink plus an entire buffet! Also, the cakes are wonderful, and normally I hate vegan desserts! GO! I actually prefer going during the week because the value is still great and you can have a nice relaxed meal with less of a crowd. The owners Rob and Elaine are awesome too! If you go on a day besides Sunday (when they are way too busy to chat), they always have something interesting to talk about."}
{"text":"The salads in the buffet are awesome!!! The restaurant is in an antique store which is cool for others. I like the bathroom full of owls(table tops). I'll go again mainly for the food though."}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a month for Sunday brunch, try to introduce it to as many people as I can. Great value. I've been twice for dinner on other days and it's also delicious, but just doesn't seem like the wildly good bang for your buck that you get on Sunday. The line in the morning goes around the block every week! The menu also changes weekly."}
{"text":"Wow,  what a disappointment.  After all the great reviews I can't help but be disappointed. The veggie burger I ate had no flavor and was a waste of money.  The veggie burger was more of a mushroom mess slopped together to look like a veggie burger.   The service was lacking. The waitress did a lousy job waiting on our table,  she was slow and non-attentive and non-existent most of the meal.   The price for the buffet was high compared to the quality of the food,  and I'm hoping lunch and dinner selections are better than the brunch.   Save yourself money and go to Double Wide Grill?  Im sure you will like it better then Zenith."}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally get to try Zenith, but was pretty disappointed! The atmosphere is awesome, I will give them that. It had a lot of visual appeal. However the rest of my experience was kind of frustrating. The staff seemed very self righteous and aloof. It seemed like anytime we talked to the staff, they came off as annoyed and bothered by us. Very unfriendly! My mother stopped the hostess as she walked by to tell her that we were ready to order (our waitress was not around) and the hostess rolled her eyes at us. Rolled her eyes! The hostess was never at her station and throughout the meal I saw people waiting long periods of time without being seated. I hate to use the term \"hipster\" but this place was way too hipster for me! I felt like I was being judged by everyone there! I even watched two waitresses point and gossip about a couple that was seated across the room. At least gossip in the kitchen! Don't do it out in the open, not very smart or nice. Now, onto the food. The food was mediocre. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. I felt really heavy after my meal. They had a buffet of appetizer type foods. A lot of the bowls were empty and my brother found a hair in one of them. I felt like they didn't put much effort or care into the food. The pancakes that my sister ordered tasted like pure baking powder. In addition to the appetizer station you got to pick an entree, which is a lot of food. Of course we didn't finish all of our food, and had a lot left. They didn't have to-go boxes! I completely understand not taking any buffet food, I get that, but you were not allowed to take home your entree that you ordered. We had to buy zip lock bags at Aldi's around the corner and secretly put our leftovers into plastic bags. Over all this place had a chaotic vibe to it. I think the main issue was the people. The staff was just unfriendly and had a \"too-cool\" vibe which was very uncomfortable. I really wanted to like this place, I really did. I was excited to eat here! But it just was not a good experience unfortunately. This place needs an attitude check. Would not recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I went to Zenith for their Sunday brunch buffet and it was an interesting experience. The antique (read: junk) shop provides a unique ambiance and plenty of things to talk about during the meal. The meal itself was mediocre; my french toast was soggy with an overly sweet strawberry syrup, and the coffee was no better than that of a typical truck stop. The buffet, however, was decent, boasting several tasty items with better nutritional value than most brunch fare. Not bad for $10. If you're really hungry on a Sunday morning and don't want to spend much money, the Zenith is a solid choice."}
{"text":"I give the food 5 stars but the cleanliness and decor a 3. The place is an antique shop, but I use the word shop loosely. It looks like a very disorganized basement with junk. I have never seen anyone buy anything in here and frankly the place is so dirty that I'm not sure that you'd want to. I don't think that anything has ever been cleaned in there. Where you eat the food seems better, but I noticed a fly or two around some of the food. It is laid out in a home buffet style. I did notice one gross thing. Each table has its own placemats. I figured that between people they would change them...Nope! The hostess scratched the crumbs and such off the place mat and then seated other people there. Again, the place has great food but after waiting there for almost 30 minutes with the junk, I couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for their sunday brunch.  The food really is terrific and the decor is fun. As a vegetarian it is so nice to be able to eat at a place where everything is an option. My 3 star rating is due to how crowded this place is. There is not enough room to accomodate the amount of people this place draws. By 11am (when they open for sunday brunch) I am too hungry to deal with the line wrapped around the room and the constant bumping and cramped quarters once I am seated. I've also experienced some equally grouchy patrons while waiting in line for the door to open. I've seen people hold a spot in line for their whole party, too. So what you thought were are two people ahead of you suddenly becomes 30 which could mean the difference between you being seated now or in an hour.   Basically, the popularity of of Zenith is it's only deterrent."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  A vegetarian dream in an odd Antique store?  Yep and fantastic prices and wonderful food to boot.  More than reasonable prices, portions and panache. Seriously, though, this hole in the wall is worth finding."}
{"text":"We went to The Zenith for an event. While we weren't thrilled at the prospect of a vegetarian restaurant, we loved Zenith! Considering we were there for an event, we had the opportunity to try an assortment of different dishes and really enjoyed all of them. My favorites were the spinach lasagna, pasta with pesto and olives, and thai pasta salad. I'm not sure if these were regular menu items, but given how good they were, I'm sure the rest of the menu is just a good. I would definitely go back!   My only complaint is that it did not have air conditioning, and got a bit hot!"}
{"text":"Zenith serves the kind of food that your non-vegetarian, culinarily inept friend might make for you. You smile and choke it down because you don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's just bad. Some noodles, ground up tofu and sauce from a can equals lasagna. The \"chickpea burger\" I foolishly ordered today appeared to be about a half pound of dry, hummus-like mush, grilled a while beforehand and served cold on a cheap, untoasted white bun. I couldn't bring myself to eat it. Two stars only because the salads are okay, and what vegan doesn't get excited about a table full of vegan cakes?! Mind you, the cakes aren't that great (tend to be a bit on the dry side), but there's a lot of them! My advice if you go for Sunday brunch: skip the entrée. I really want to like Zenith. I love the concept, and they all seem like nice folks who mean well, but they really need to work on their recipe development."}
{"text":"Zenith Antiques gives vegans everywhere a bad name. I went here because it's recommended as a \"great vegan spot in Pittsburgh\" while nothing could be further from the truth. Is the food vegan? Sure. Is it decent? Absolutely not.   Ignoring the fact that it the \"antiques\" that are barricaded sloppily in the space are actually similar to donations that Good Will recieves/sells (and that it smells like a musty old Good Will store), the last time I went here (December 2012) to try to dissuade me from hating this place, someone was smoking a cigarette inside at one of the tables. Pardon me for trying to avoid ordering COPD with a side of lung cancer while at brunch. DISGUSTING. This is not a night club, if it were, I could potentially ignore this transgression and chalk it up to \"he was so wasted, he lit up a cigarette.\" This is obviously an acceptable standard at Zenith Antiques, and consequently the atmosphere and the food stinks."}
{"text":"All you can eat vegan buffet on Sundays!!! Plus you get an entree option (some of which have dairy) and a tea or coffee. The buffet has amazing cakes and pies for desert - all vegan and probably 10 different types. Everything they have is delicious and the two of us usually share one entree and go all out on the buffet (it's way too much food if you like the buffet items)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's definitely one of my favorite vegan-friendly places to eat at in Pittsburgh. I love the concept for this restaurant. It's always fun to eat with strangers and you're in this amazing antique store, so there's lots to look at! The food is superb. The buffet is amazing in and of itself, then you get a whole table of cake, plus your meal choice from a separate list! It's incredible! The staff is also super friendly. I would definitely recommend this buffet place to anyone! Be sure to get there early, as there is usually a line and parking can be difficult to find."}
{"text":"Q: Where do all the hipster-vegans go when they get fed up with Quiet Storm's brunch? A: Zenith  The food was good, all vegetarian, the coffee was pretty okay for a breakfast joint. The wait wasn't extremely long and the hostess was nice enough to ask us beforehand if we minded being sat with other people and/or children neither of which bothered us. It's a family set-up, so it's more like a huge dining room with a big buffet table than anything else. I can understand the appeal of this sort of place, but in the end it's just not for me. A little too much noise for my mornings. If you can deal with that many people talking that early in the morning, then this place is for you. Also, now that I think about it, this may be the only thing I've enjoyed in the South Side."}
{"text":"We went in for Sunday brunch this week. Our party of three each ordered a different entrée and then split everything so we could try a little of each. Honestly, the pastas that were offered on the buffet were the best parts of the meal. The peanut noodles were divine. I probably would have been totally happy with a full bowl of those peanut noodles and nothing else.  The buffet was extensive and I tried to taste a little of everything. I'm not a huge carnivore but I'm not a vegetarian either. You have so many options at Zenith that you don't really miss meat in your meal. Everything is tasty. The cakes were all great. I definitely ate too much but how can you not when everything is so good? The atmosphere is so unique it felt like you were sitting in someone's living room. A really comfortable atmosphere, staff was super friendly, the food was good. I think if you have an adventurous spirit when it comes to trying new foods then Zenith is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I went for Sunday brunch and loved it. I thought the antique store part was fascinating and it has the added bonus of making any wait time for a table go by in a flash (there was also coffee you could help yourself to before being seated.) I saw some nice antique compacts and there were more vintage clothes than I expected, glass coffee pots, beautiful vintage chairs, etc. some of it is dusty and it's sort of a cozy clutter of oddities and antiques. Examples of the oddities are a literal shrine to the Steelers complete with kneeling bench, and glass table lamps filled with painted Barbies. The food though! It was really terrific, very flavorful, very filling. I was in a party of 2 and we were seated with some other guests at a large table. For $11.50 I got unlimited coffee & tea, an entree  from a small menu that I understand changes weekly and unlimited access to the 100% vegetarian (and vegan?) buffet. A dozen different bundt cakes to try, some of the best hummus I've ever eaten, salads, fruit, cilantro beans, a variety of cold pasta dishes, orzo, penne, peanut noodles, spicy green beans, chickpea salad, a great herbed potato salad with vinegar dressing...etc. I'm sure it changes every week so there's no use itemizing everything. I loved how everything was seasoned, no two dishes tasted too much alike; mostly basic ingredients that were well prepared with surprising variety, nourishing, and most importantly tasted really good. I loved the lack of tofu especially, not that I dislike tofu but it's everywhere. The seitan slices in my entree tasted great and not like they just slid them out of a can. Good times. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"A vegetarians dream come true.  Don't call to ask about wait times though, whoo, they get super grouchy with you about that!  Geez!"}
{"text":"oh, zenith. you might be one of my favorite places ever, as a vegan who also really loves antique/thrift stores, the melding of the two was pretty mindblowing. the antique shop is super cute and full of treasures of all sorts and price ranges, and the restaurant is equally cool. (you can buy the art on the walls, and even the chairs/table you're dining at, if so inclined.) oh, yes, they also sell a variety of teas.   and then there's the vegan sunday buffet--$10 gets you an insane amount of food and drink---an entree, a table fllled with side dishes, and a dessert table that was overwhelming with the amount of sweets it held. oh yeah, and unlimited (really good) tea and coffee.  this place makes me happy happy happy. i hope to return soon."}
{"text":"I had brunch with my girlfriends in this brunch place on a very cold winter day..... and the dishes of the brunch buffet were cold, too. The dessert, like cakes, was just too sweet and heavy..... I know lots of people love it, but maybe it is not for me. The only one good thing was that you can have hot coffee while you are waiting for a table in the shop."}
{"text":"Quirky and fantastic blend of vegetarian / vegan homemade delights and a mesmerizing collection of eclectic antiques. Pittsburgh classic that really is a best kept secret. The menu is limited because of the boutique nature of establishment. Family run and fantastic creative items like the Tofishy Sandwish ( this is Tofu done amazingly right ) and many others. Vegetarian or Vegan and up for something not so cookie cutter? Try this spot. Saturday lunch or Sunday Brunch are also great times."}
{"text":"Very weird atmosphere, but charming. The restaurant sits in the back corner of a chaotic novelty/vintage/junk shop full of a ton of random items. The first thing that I noticed, that stuck with me through the night was that all the cloth textured items gave the restaurant a musky, hot smell. Like being in a carpet cocoon in humid weather. We had to seek out the small staff of husband and wife, but once we found them they were nice and attentive.   We ordered the seitan meatloaf and stuffed mushrooms and both got the soup. Large portions, and the food came out quickly. The stuffed mushrooms weren't really stuffed as much as they were laying flat under a layer of rice and vegatables. The food was good, but not amazing. Seitan meatloaf and potatoes tasted like I expected. Gravy and potatoes is always pretty good. Mushroom and filling was flat.  Good overall though! Soup was the best apart."}
{"text":"One of THE most unique restaurants i've ever been to. The Zenith is an old art gallery turned thrift shop, turned restaurant with all vegetarian food, and a weekly menu that's never the same.   I saw this place on Yelp and online and had to give it a shot. The side salad i had was top notch, as was the portabella  mushroom with mashed yams and an apple salsa. Worth a visit just to see the interior, but a delicious, filling, home-made meal as well."}
{"text":"Awesome unique place my boyfriend took me to and figured I would like it. I definitely loved the decor from all the antiques and vintage oddities, I absolutely loved the atmosphere it was great, I'm really glad he took me here...however the food we ended  up getting was pretty good, but since we arrived later on in the early afternoon they were sold out of most the menu which was awful, but the buffet we has was ok, but I definitely would love to go back again and try more options on the menu that we wanted to try."}
{"text":"Delicious food aplenty for not a lot of penny in a setting that makes anybody smile.  Unique vegetarian menu in this antique shop venue -- with waitstaff with a friendly, can-do attitude."}
{"text":"The zenith is a really hipster, unique looking place. It's also an antique store and the restaurant is almost hidden in the back. We came for brunch and got the TLT. The tofu is amazing!! The entrée comes with the entire buffet which includes noodles and different types of salads. There are also a variety of cakes which are really moist and tasty. It's nice and inexpensive, and a drink is included in the meal. Overall I had a great experience at this cute place."}
{"text":"I seriously cannot get enough of this place. It is by far my FAVORITE place to eat at, and it is always my go-to when I want to go out to eat. Zenith was initially very confusing and strange on my first visit, as you walk straight into a vintage thrift store. Walk to the back of the building, and viola! Seating. There are two separate rooms for eating, all furnished with vintage tables, coverings, and dishes. There is no A/C, so be prepared for it to get a bit stuffy in the summer.  The food here is awesome. Comfort food along with unique dishes make this a great place for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters alike. Some dishes are more unique than others, and they rotate the menu each week. The Sunday brunch is a MUST if you have not experienced. For less than $12, you get your choice of entree plus an endless supply of savory salads, pastas, grape leaves, and CAKE. Seriously, probably the biggest reason we come back here all the time is the cake. I cannot recommend it enough. It's entirely vegan and they have SO. MANY. VARIATIONS. Spiced pear. Chocolate hazelnut. Chocolate peanut butter banana. Cherry vanilla with GIANT chunks of cherry. The list is endless. Brunch is a great way to try a ton of different flavors and find your favorite. The seating can be tight at brunch, and I recommend getting there early. Be prepared to share a table with people you don't know! Make some new friends and have some good conversation.  Service here is always great. The staff is wonderful, we are always tended to very quickly, and many times they treat us to \"extras\" because the owners are so excited about the food/desserts they make that they can't help but share."}
{"text":"This place is the best for Sunday brunch.  Its a vegetarian's paradise.  There's so much to choose from on the buffet, and you also have your choice of a meal and tea. I had the spicy chickpea soft tacos when I was there last. Set my mouth on fire, but, luckily, I was able to calm that after devouring the crazy amazing desserts. This is definitely a place to take guests from out of town. One thing I dislike about the joint is that the seating is so limited, you're typically sat with other people that aren't with your party. So, if you're looking for a more intimate setting, at least for brunch, this isn't the place. Can't wait to try out their dinner menu sometime."}
{"text":"Calling all vegans this is your dream place for brunch!  Even non vegans like me will love it.  Go right when the place opens to get in line as it gets very crowded for Sunday brunch and can be a pretty long wait. The place is located inside a neat antique shop and you can shop while you wait. We went right at 11 when they open and the line was already down the street. Luckily we were seated pretty quickly with our party of 3 and they added 2 others from another party into our table.  Community seating is the new thing and we met a cool couple.  It is a set price of 11.50 for coffee or tea, buffet and an entrée. The buffet is enough for a full meal with many salads, fruits and an amazing pound cake bar. Then with the entrée on top you will leave feeling full. This past visit they had about 5 entrees to pick from. I went with the one non vegan option of scrambled eggs with cheese and it came with some kind of sweet hash. Others in my party ordered the veggie burger which was a huge portion. They also have French toast and pancake options. Everything is vegan and tastes delicious.  I enjoyed a little sampling of most salads from the buffet including fresh fruit, a potatoes salad that does not have the normal mayonnaise taste, green beans, and lots of other fresh veggie salads. The pound cake options are just amazing from pumpkin to double chocolate with raspberry. A must try for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for brunch! Everything I tried was delicious. There's a lot of yummy options in the buffet. Love the funky decor and the stored attached to it. I'll definitely be coming back with friends."}
{"text":"An eclectic, funky place that is so cool!! I'm not a vegan but the place has wonderful food and great tea!!!! I highly recommend the Zenith!! BYOBand enjoy the decor!!!"}
{"text":"First, I will say that the food was delicious. However, the ambiance was VERY...... interesting. Being that me and my date were the only people in the joint, it was even more so. Won't be back but it's because it's just not for me. But the FOOD was great, truly. I will stress that."}
{"text":"1 word: Mmmmmmmmmmm! This vegan restaurant may have the most distinct character of any other restaurant in Pittsburgh. The veggie/vegan brunch here is legend. The antique store on your way in is epic. The food and desserts, all baked by a couple of lovely women that are friends of friends, are so tasty. The inside decor is so cute and cozy, filled with big, older tables with older furniture and cute antique-like decorations. on the walls and hanging from the ceiling above. At first I wasn't too stoked about the big table setup- particularly if you're going by yourself or just with a friend. However, a couple of times I've met some really cool people that came and set beside me or my group. The people who work here are amazing, and I love the cool, young, hip patrons that come in. For years I only had been here for their brunch, but a couple of years ago I actually had my birthday dinner here with a big group of friends- and the dinner meal was great too! Going on a weekday surely doesn't have the same craziness as a Sunday brunch, but a very good and different experience in its own right. I couldn't recommend this place more highly- even if you aren't a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place all the stars in the world, I would. Amazing place. From the food, the options, the location, atmosphere, service; it was amazing.   I went here with a friend for lunch and ordered a hummus platter for an appetizer and for my meal I purchased the seitan Reuben of the week. Delicious. The service is also very hospitable and friendly. They even gave us samples of the cakes they were making (we were the only people in the restaurant).   The whole place is very eclectic and very interesting. The restaurant is within an antique store but the overall experience is a must for all vegetarians, vegans, or those who like to try new things.  Edit: They also have changing menus weekly, so keep up on their website for new items!"}
{"text":"This is my fav sunday  brunch restaurant in Pittsburgh it is 100% vegetarian. On sundays they have $10 brunch that includes one entree and a buffet. The buffet has everything from grape leaves, different salads, and fruits. they also have desserts likes pies and about 4-5 flavors of cake and desert breads. They also offer coffee or tea i looove the coffee.  They flavours are great and i always have a food baby after brunch. The owner makes almost everything and the decor is pretty cool. when you walk in you walk through an antique store and then get seated its pretty cool in there. The service has been questionable on some occasions but all the food is worth it.  Tip: if you get there early before 11 or a little bit after the wait might not be too bad. but even if you have to wait they serve you coffee!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, not a fan of their pancakes but the rest of the food is awesome, this is a treasure in Pittsburgh. I enjoy it much and please ignore the less than favorable reviews, this is just home style vegetarian & vegan food, not gourmet, I will say some of their  dishes I would say I consider gourmet, this good hearty food and reasonable..."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for the weekend and had Sunday brunch at Zenith: a place like this simply wouldn't be possible in Brooklyn, due to the higher cost of everything. You sit at communal tables in a homely dining room -- filled with artwork, plants, nick-naks, and light streaming through the windows -- and help yourself to a delicious buffet of vegan salads, featuring ingredients such as macaroni, olives, corn, tomatoes, chickpeas, melons, potato, and pesto. I piled my small plate high. The buffet includes a great selection of freshly made bundt cakes with various creamy frostings. I would've been happy with the buffet alone, but it comes with a made-to-order entree -- I chose the portabello mushroom with sweet potato mash and sampled the scrambled eggs, which were good, but nothing spectacular. All this for just $10. There were some downsides, however. The place was packed out at noon so we had to wait; the staff were running around madly and the entrees took a long time to come out, so the whole experience was rather chaotic. Zenith is definitely worth experiencing, but it's probably not going to be your regular brunch spot simply because of the crowds."}
{"text":"Best brunch, best waitstaff, best antiques.  The seating is amazing.  If you're a small group you may be sat with another small group.  It's great to have new conversation.  Lunch and dinner there?  Always superb.  It's quiet.  It's fresh.  And there is a ton to look at while you're in there.  It's like eating at your old irish gypsy grandma's"}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh for a week and ate here 3 times. I dinged them a star because of no alcohol. Beer and wine would be nice. But besides that the place has wonderful vegan homemade food.  I'll admit, it's weird when you first walk in because you cannot see the restaurant at all from the door. You're basically standing in a very crowded thrift store environment. I knew this ahead of time but it is still off putting.  They are only open Th- Sun. Sunday brunch was out of this world! So. Much. Food. And a lot of desserts. Heaven. Also, I don't think they have A/C because they have lots of fans on. It was July. So don't expect to walk in to a refreshingly cool environment on a hot day. Just saying. I would go back here in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"I would give the brunch 4 stars because it is a fun place to go--I like the atmosphere, the diversity of the ALL VEG offerings, and you can't beat the $10 price. I was not *amazed* by anything I ate there, and the service was sometimes a bit sketchy, but it was all good enough and the options and affordability make it some place to which I will return on Sundays to come.  Dinner, however, was another story. My girlfriend and I stopped in for an early dinner on our way out to a free concert in South Park. We ordered grape leaves (6/$3.50) for an appetizer and we both had the Tunisian Red Bean Stew (red beans, yams, red peppers, tomatoes, onions and jalapenos simmered in a spicy peanut sauce over rice), served with a side salad ($10).   The grape leaves were quite good and easily the best part of the meal. The salad was downright bad. It was all the same kind of lettuce, smashed into a bowl with ~4 pieces of green bean, about the same number of red cabbage shreds, piled with bell pepper (which I hate), and a few grapes. The dressing was so strong with vinegar it made us both cough. There was so much pooled in the bottom of the bowl that we just left the bottom third of the salad because it was completely inedible.   The entree was okay, but not wonderful. It was a little dry, the elements seemed to blend into each other rather than stand out individually and the sauce was one-dimensional. I usually expect a \"spicy peanut sauce\" to be a little more complex with the peanuts adding a sweet-savory base on which the heat from the peppers can play, but the pepper heat washed out the peanut flavor in this dish. The rice managed to be both sticky and dry, so the meal felt pretty heavy.  Despite the criticisms above, Zenith is okay and it certainly is not overpriced. It is a fun place to dine as you'll always find some new funky object to check out, but don't go expecting to be amazed by the food. There are more options available for Sunday brunch and you can't beat the all-you-can-eat sides and sweets.   It's worth going for the Steelers shrine alone."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm an avid carnivorous meat lover.  And I still love zenith, despite it being vegetarian/vegan.  Walking into zenith, it's a thrift store filled with all sorts of curiosities.  Behind the store is the restaurant, with tables scattered between random antiques and oddities.  There's two parts to zenith: the main meal and the buffet.  The buffet has myriads of salads, pasta salads, different pastries, and desserts.  The main is your typical brunch menu.  I don't think I've had such tasty vegan food in my life.  The only struggle is figuring out how to portion yourself so that you can enjoy a little bit of everything.  Pro tip: get there early- we lined up in front maybe 30 minutes before they opened and we still had to wait in line a bit.  I feel like Pittsburgh has some random gems, and Zenith is definitely one of them."}
{"text":"Most of my 4 stars is for the amazing atmosphere of Zenith. You could possibly spend HOURS wandering around looking at all the stuff in Zenith (it is also an antique store). How many things can they possibly hang from the ceiling? How many things can they hang salon style on every wall? Have you seen the bathrooms yet?  The food is pretty awesome, too. Sundays are the times to go -- vegan/vegetarian buffet (includes coffee/tea drinks) for $10. Make sure to show up early, lines start forming quickly!"}
{"text":"My lady and I eat here on average at least once a month. Always delicious and I love the social aspect of being seated with strangers. Love the iced tea and the buffet. I wish the staff wore uniforms but other than that Zenith is awesome!"}
{"text":"The concept is great, but the execution is a little off. They served noodle salad with peanut sauce (which was good) with ice cubes tongs to serve yourself. This resulted in smashed or cut noodles. Some of the items seemed like they were trying too hard to be different with middling results. The price is right on par though. I just wouldnt call it a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The Zenith is a hidden gem. If you like antiques, this place is paradise. If you like quality vegetarian food, this place is paradise. If you like antiques and quality vegetarian food, then might as well pack your bags and move into the store.   I came here for Sunday brunch. To be honest, the antiques (especially the mannequins) kind of freaked me out a little bit. I'm not a huge antiques fan, so thought the atmosphere was a little bit stuffy. However, once I got over that and focused on the food, I had an amazing experience. For ~$10, you get an entrée of your choice and access to an all you can eat buffet filled with delicious appetizers and desserts (cake galore). I got the soft tacos for my entrée. I'm not a vegetarian, but I thought the vegetarian tacos were delicious. I couldn't even tell they were vegetarian. For those who are vegans, there are plenty of options too. I think I focused on the buffet more than the entrée itself.   Atmosphere is great! People are friendly and so much to look at while you eat. Overall, this place is absolutely amazing. It has a lot of exotic dishes and perfect for vegetarians/vegans. Even a meat eater like myself thought the vegetarian options were phenomenal. A little warning though, you have to be a little adventurous with food and be willing to try unusual sounding choices."}
{"text":"Can't say I thought the food here was that great.  It's a very interesting experience though, and worth trying at least once.  The breakfast bar food (buffet style) is much better than the hot food, imo.  I had blueberry pancakes, which were too dense and not blueberry enough.  I think everyone in my party agreed that the food was average.  I will say that the atmosphere is extremely unique and lends itself to good conversation.  The servers are fun as well, and you can't beat the prices.  It seems like it would attract a hipster crowd, except families and old people go too.  Go figure."}
{"text":"Greatest vegaterian food in the whole united states prices are great. Always full of people"}
{"text":"I have decided that if I say anything about this place, more people will find out about it and it will be impossible to every get a seat. However if people don't  know how amazing the concept, food, and decor is, they might not go. What to do? fine.  This place is so good.  It is a regular stop on my brunch rotation.  Sundays get you an all you can brunch buffet.  The buffet consists of about 15 different salads and sides ( grape leaves, chickpeas, beans, Greek, to name a few.)  ALL COMPLETELY VEGETARIAN.  Then you also get to pick a main course.  They are creative, healthy and very tasty. About 5 choices.  Fantastic flavorful and so good for you.  I walk away gorged on food thinking, today I did something really good for my body. Its almost like a meal there is a cleanse and I always feel like a test start to my health.  And the includes the one simple detail I have failed to mention.  The buffet also includes unlimited cake.  Flavors unheard and familar. All bundt cake. All very very good. Usually 10 or so flavors at the same time to pick from.  It doesn't make the meal any less healthy.  It provides the same well rounded nature that life desires.  I love this place.  I really do.  So bring on the wait, cause this place deserves it."}
{"text":"Had brunch here a couple weeks ago with a friend visiting from out of town and my husband. It definitely had an interesting atmosphere and the food was pretty good, too. You get an entree and beverage, as well as access to a huge buffet. I do wish that they allowed doggy-bags though for the entree, or that you could opt for either the entree or the buffet, because my entree was so big that I barely touched the buffet.   It's a bit hectic, so you'll want to get there about 10 minutes before it opens if you want to sit down right away. There were literally people lined up around the block! It's not a bad place to wait though - plenty of merchandise to check out and they also had live music the day I was there. My friend found a nice dress for cheap on our way out."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch. My friend and I shared the pasta salad and a variety of pastries. They give you the option of the hot bar, ordering off the menu, or both. We had pancakes that were really good, pasta, and a ton of offers from the buffet. All very good! It is a little odd and you have to enter the restaurant from the front and walk through some weird items that look like what you'd find in your grandma's basement, but it's worth getting to the back and enjoying the food."}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere 5 stars for price 2 stars for food = overall 3 stars  a few decent buffet items, but the tea and the entree were both really weird tasting.  wouldn't come back here for food, but may come back to check the antiques"}
{"text":"AWESOME spot for Sunday Brunch!  Have been twice and love it.  There is something for everyone-- and with a vegetarian and vegan in our Pittsburgh crowd, Zenith is great for making EVERYONE happy.  The food is good (not life-changing, but still solid) and there is a buffet.  Which has pasta salad.  And cake.  What.  I would be happy eating nothing BUT pasta salad and cake.  But then you order a \"main\" entree that is generally a hot dish too!  And, drumroll, it's $10.  Last time I was there, I had lemon blueberry french toast.. it was hot and gooey and lemoney and had fresh blueberries-- delivered exactly as expected!  The service is friendly and the atmosphere is super cool; you never run out of things to look at since it's an antique shop as well.  Cool place for anyone, but must try for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  I was there for Sunday Brunch and couldn't believe how reasonably priced it was and the amount of food I received.  The service and quality was amazing even when they were super busy.  Zenith has such a positive welcoming vibe.  If you haven't tried them yet you are really missing out!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan/vegetarian. Super cool design with the restaurant being in an antique store. The price is really impressive - you order an entree and can go to the buffet! Food quality seems like like it might be from Costco or off the Sysco truck, but it tastes amazing! If you're looking for seasonal/local, doesn't seem like the place for you, but it's a neat place to try and the food doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've only gone once and it was for Sunday brunch.  We didn't get there early or at opening time, but a couple hours in and there was no line out the door.  Four of us sat on a couch and chairs and drank coffee while we waited to be seated.  I was only slightly afraid that something would fall on my head while waiting (in an antique store crammed full of various things, and yes, some were hanging from the ceiling).  We were offered to be seated with another party, but due to social anxiety with one in our party we asked if it was possible to have our own table: of course but it will be a few more minutes then (only 5-10 minutes longer).  We sat, ordered, helped ourselves to a delicious buffet.  I'm more of a fan of brunch meaning breakfast foods at lunch time, rather than the breakfast and lunch foods.  Did not care here!  Everything I tried was delicious.  I had french toast as my entree which was good at satisfying my once in awhile french toast craving.  It was a bit of a carb overload with that, all of the yummy cakes, and then the buffet pastas and whatnot.  Did I mind?  Heck no.  It was delicious!  I just wish I could have ate more.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly staff! One of the best vegan meals I've had in a while. Just moved to Pittsburgh and will be visiting this place often."}
{"text":"I adore Zenith. I've since explained this place to non-Pittsburghers as the hipster Cracker Barrel, though that description does not do Zenith enough justice. I chose the pumpkin pancake as my main entrée at my last visit, but I have to admit, the star of the show is the buffet table. There wasn't a single item I tried from the buffet that was anything less than stellar, from creamy peanut butter Asian noodles to the fresh, crisp salad (because then I can pretend that I'm eating healthy, right?) to the myriad cakes they have lying in tantalizing wait for you at the buffet finish line... ahhhh. Lovely. My only regret is that I was too full to try more of those delectable bundt cakes. After our feast, we had a blast browsing through all of the antiques at the front of the store. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Pittsburgh, I go to Zenith for Sunday brunch. They'll ask you order a \"main dish,\" but the accompanying buffet (all included for one price) is even more glamorous, beginning with 10 varieties of vegan upside-down cake, fresh fruit, and endless amounts of salads and savories. The decor is astounding--it doubles as an antique shop, after all! I've also scored some of my most prized possessions there. Vegan or not, you must experience Zenith!"}
{"text":"Quirky vegan place with great tea and cake. NOM!"}
{"text":"The best part of Zenith is the salads and desserts that come with Sunday brunch. They have distinct flavors and combinations in all their offerings. The  worst part of Zenith is that the entrees are not always so good. They're innovative and interesting, but they're not always that great.  I've had French toast and pancakes where one of the two pieces were burnt and they were still served. Two weeks ago my friend ordered a sweet and sour tofu rice dish that was 50% liquid. My chickpea sandwich was good, but the rice that came with was overly sweet and disappointing. The entrees are overall just not my thing. I wish they were but they're just disappointing.  The service is usually really good. The food is also served within an antique shop (which is kind of their thing/shtick) but it's also kind of musty/dusty."}
{"text":"Edit: I took away one star because I went back with my family today and the entrees were not as good. Trader Joe's has better frozen vindaloo than the one served today. The ginger seitan was the best item and was served as a big heaping on a plate. While, the vindaloo and egg dish were small portions. However, I would recommend visiting because it is a nice opportunity to try different things at brunch.  Man the sunday brunch is such a deal! The coffee is excellent, the side and cake buffet were awesome, and my jakarta tofu wrap was so great I hope that I can visit pittsburgh to eat here again. (I must confess that I initially was turned off by the idea of eating tofu in a wrap, but the texture was different than the usual asian kind I am used to. Plus the flavor was delicious) I loved the lemon lime cake the best. It reminded me of key lime pie. The actual antique store is wonderful and worth a visit alone!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here, I wish I could come every Sunday for brunch!  Everything on the buffet and most of the entrees are vegan, or are clearly labelled as not. Meat-eaters will not be disappointed here, either. No matter if you go sweet or savory, the entrees are always delicious. The almond pancakes and anything seitan are some of the best things I've ever eaten. Everything on the buffet is delicious, I'd say the hummus and peanut noodles are favorites among my friends. The cakes and pies are also amazing, especially with the unlimited coffee and tea.  Love. Love, love, love. Stay forever Zenith, and never change."}
{"text":"Such a fun place. Restaurant with vegetarian and vegan options AND a vintage store wrapped in one. Decorations for the food part is so fun. Old and cluttered in a fun way, mismatched furniture and silverware. Delicious and well priced food."}
{"text":"The zenith is easily the coolest restaurant I've ever been to.  The food is also fantastic.  I went for the sunday brunch - my god.  $10 for a main course and all you can eat sides.  The sesame cold noodles and 10 different types of vegan cakes, wow.  I had the tofu tacos - perfect.  I also had a bite of the ginger seitan - also delicious.  If I lived close, it would be a weekly haunt.  PLEASE OPEN A ZENITH IN PHILADELPHIA.  thank you."}
{"text":"I actually can't get over it. It's been almost 24 hours and I'm still struggling with the fact that I paid just $10 for this brunch experience. I say \"experience,\" because it truly is one!  The front of Zenith is bursting with antiques from floor to ceiling.  Nothing life-changing, but a delightful assortment to peruse while waiting for a table.  We waited 40 minutes on a Sunday afternoon, but it flew by amongst the racks of vintage clothing, jewelry, housewares and hipsters.  Our party of four was seated at a roomy 6-top that you'd swear came straight outta Grandma's kitchen.  I had no idea what to expect from the brunch and was very excited to learn that we were given an option of one of many mouthwatering entrees AND the buffet.  I asked what type of food was on the buffet and I absolutely stopped listing when our server said \"Well, we have a cake buffet...\" A CAKE BUFFET?  I mean, why...haven't...I...been...here....before?!  Yes, a cake buffet; chock full of a variety of bundt cakes including Banana Chocolate, Raspberry Almond, Chocolate Coconut and just too many more to mention.  The buffet also included a salad section featuring peanut noodles, macaroni salad, hummus, potato salad and again - too many more to mention.    After stuffing my face with much of the aforementioned I received my entree of Seitan Gyro (vegetarian gyro).  It was fine, but I wouldn't order it again.  Let me be clear though - nothing WRONG with the gyro. It just turns out I don't love Seitan.  Also included in the massive $10 charge is your choice of hot or iced tea. I opted for the raspberry/peach iced and DAMN, it was good!  I liked the glass so much, I asked if I could buy it and they obliged, for the super-fair price of $3.    So, for $16 (including glass and tip) I walked out of Zenith with my fill of gyro, bundt cakes galore, delicious salads-o-plenty and a really big smile.  I can't wait to return!!!!"}
{"text":"Best brunch deal in town - and hands down the best vegan brunch ever. I've brunched at Zenith probably a dozen times and I've never been disappointed. Don't eat anything before you come, because you've got to save room for everything on the buffet (peanut noodles! Bundr cakes!) - plus your entree! The entree menu differs every week so keep your eyes peeled for an item that intrigues you."}
{"text":"We are avid travelers and love the random hole in the wall places with genuine service, food we won't get anywhere else, and an unmatched atmosphere! We just found our hidden gem! Must come here to experience this treasure of delicious food and eye candy for entertainment!"}
{"text":"I really like the Zenith Tea Room, of all the restaurants I have ever eaten in, Zenith has a personality all it's own. The inside of the restaurant is decorated like nothing I had ever seen before.  It reminds me of going to my nana's house full of nick nacks and chotchkies, but the interior in done in such a way that it's charming and inviting.   I am not a vegan by any stretch of the imagination, but I do enjoy creative dishes and Zenith does not disappoint.   I enjoyed their appetizers sampler plate you get hummus, grape leave olives and feta cheese.  The hummus was very good and thick which as the way I like to eat it.   I feel that you get a  good amount of munchies for the price, Zenith for a restaurant in the Southside has very reasonably priced menu offerings."}
{"text":"One of the best places where one can enjoy brunch in Pittsburgh!  To be honest, I'm not a big fan of brunch, mostly because I'm a guy and would like spend more time doing real fun stuff. But Zenith has never brought me this kind of feeling since going to Zenith is something FUN.  No need to say to much about their food. Just wonderful.  The real interesting things are their decorations as well as all kinds of antiques that fill up the entire place.   A \"must-go\" in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food in a very unusual setting.  The prices are very affordable and they can accommodate large groups.  The store carries an odd assortment of collectibles, antiques and used items, I had a lot of fun browsing after my meal.  The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Easter Sunday and my boyfriend takes me on a surprise brunch date. I was ECSTATIC when I realized we were going to Zenith. I have driven past this place, literally hundreds of times and probably every single time said \"I really want to go there!\"  We waited in line for a minute and chose to seat with another group in order to be seated more quickly. No problem at all. We grabbed ourselves a coffee to start, had some water, ordered an iced tea and our entrees and headed over to the buffet. It was unbelievable how much food was there. With the $11.50 purchase you receive: a drink, the buffet and an entree. How cheap is that?! Here's a list of some of the items I had at the buffet and a description of how delicious they were:  Peanut Noodles- this was most definitely my favorite item on the buffet by far. The cold noodles were so tasty and I couldn't stop eating them. SO DELICIOUS. Macaroni Salad- reallllllly good.  Potatoes with a chimichurri sauce- SO GOOD Broccoli with mushrooms- so good. the broccoli was crunchy and the mushrooms were juicy and packed with flavor Veggie Orzo salad- YUM. Again, packed with flavor Fruit salad- fresh and tasty Spinach & Strawberry Salad- Amazing.   Do you see a pattern here? Everything was incredible. It was all cold items, and all packed with flavor. I wasn't sure how my carnivorous boyfriend would react to this place, but he and I agreed on every item we tried. In addition to the cold salads at the buffet, they had different bread options, as well as a desert table with pies and tons of cakes. I tried a lemon mint rum pound cake, strawberry vanilla pound cake and a chocolate almond one. ALL of them were so delicious.   Was that all we ate? Of course not. In addition to the incredible buffet, you get to pick an entree. The list of options weren't too big, about 8 options. I went with the vegan lemon pancakes with strawberry topping. My boyfriend went with the vegan bbq seitan sandwich. I really enjoyed my pancakes- they were SO tasty and moist and just insanely delicious. My boyfriend wasn't as crazy with his sandwich- he ate it and liked it but thought it was a little dry. Both of our meals came with a curried rice, which actually wasn't super good, but it didn't matter, because there were SO many buffet items to compensate for it.   The most random insanely delicious item we had there? The ICED TEA. It was literally the best iced tea I have ever had. It was just black iced tea, but it was so tasty and bolder than other teas I've had. We were sad we couldn't take a pitcher home with us.  In addition to the food, I LOVED this place because of the experience of it. Chairs and other decor hanging above your head while you eat, different colored rugs on the floor, pictures and other items all over the walls- it was so entertaining to look at everything. After I ate, I walked around the store for a bit to look at the clothes, shoes, jewelry and everything else they had to offer.   Basically, I'm obsessed with this place. The service was great, the food was unbelievable, the atmosphere was so fun... I am anxiously anticipating when I can return again! :)"}
{"text":"Zenith was exactly what I needed during a recent trip to Pittsburgh. A friend and I had headed out that way to go to Fallingwater, and thought navigating Pittsburgh's fun would be easy. I'm going to say that it actually wasn't. However, our Sunday brunch at Zenith opened up the doors to the goodness of Pittsburgh. We waited in a fairly long line just to get in the doors at opening, and then were seated family style. And then were completely befuddled by the ridiculously large amount of food we were offered for 10 dollars. You can go through the bufftet, which has a variety of vegetarian salads, from green salad to a Thai peanut noodle salad, to traditional pasta salad, a corn and black bean mixture, an Israeli couscous sitch that made my little heart sing... and then a whole table of various bundt cakes and pies. The almond cake with chocolate icing was enough to make me want to stay forever. On top of all that, we got to pick an entree. I selected a casserole of lentils, brown rice, spinach, carrots, and ginger-soy sauce with cashews. It was excellent, and I wish I could have eaten more of the whole thing. The more traditional breakfast entrees looked good, too, though I only sampled the apple pancakes. They were quite tasty.  Though it was definitely busy, I never felt rushed or stressed to move on, and we wandered through the store part after lunch. It was cute and not overpriced, and if I could have brought a couple of larger furniture items back, or even had room for them in the first place, i probably would have. So even though it's right off of Carson St, which was a bit of a horror the night before, going to brunch at Zenith reminded me of the mysterious charm of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my father for fathers day, he's totally a meat eater, but he's open minded sometimes.   The food was delicious as always, I have the seitan and the girlfriend had the tofu salad sandwich. The brunch buffet has Peanut Noodles to die for! As well the spinach and strawberry salad was yummy!   The environment makes this place even more awesome! We spent some time exploring the antique shop after we were done eating and it's reminds me of my great aunt Mary's bedroom, just filled with awesome trash.  Overall please go to here for brunch on Sundays. You won't regret it, and even your non-vegetarian parents will fall in love."}
{"text":"I always take my non-vegan friends here and they love it. The service is excellent and they always remember us every time we come in. The atmosphere is so unique and no place I have been is really like it. It feels like you are in someone home and you are getting a home cooked meal. Very reasonable price for an all you can eat meal."}
{"text":"A carnivore by nature, I was skeptical the first time I was dragged to this vegan and vegetarian mecca for brunch, but my mind was immediately changed at the first bite of peanut noodles. My plate was already full of several kinds of pastas, bread, hummus, green beans, various fruits and a sampling of the vegan cakes before I realized you also order an entree! I wont claim that each dish Ive tried was the best, but thats the magic of the buffet/entree double whammy! You can experiment (and I encourage you to be a little adventurous!) with the changing menu, and if its not your thing, go back to those amazing peanut noodles and cakes.   Zenith's atmosphere is also worth the trip. Its an antique store at its best with local art on the walls and hanging from the ceiling. The dishes are colorful, the glasses are mismatched goblets and the crowd is great for people watching.  I know people complain about long lines and potentially having to share a table, but its really a testament to how good it is! That being said, plan ahead! Get there about 15-20 minutes before its supposed to open and talk about your Saturday night adventures while you wait for them to get set up. Go in table sized groups of 2, 4 or 6 to avoid having to sit with other people if youd rather do that (although you are sure to meet characters if you end up sharing a table). If you cant go early, go expecting a wait and with your mind made up to sort through antiques before food.  All in all, if you are a Sunday brunch kind of person, give it a shot :)"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely captivating (mostly vegan) restaurant within an antique store (or an antique store within a restaurant) and I loved whatever it is that they're going for. We made it here for Easter brunch. Zenith has to be the first (and only) place where I was almost a bit disappointed when our host told us our wait time would be only 5 minutes. They have coffee/tea for you while you wait on eclectic antique couches and their entire store for you to explore.. and I certainly would have enjoyed a longer wait time. Soon enough we were seated and our coffee/tea was refilled and we placed our entree  order. Their Easter brunch, inclusive of the entree, coffee/tea refills, a large buffet of salads, breads, appetizers and desserts is priced super reasonably at $11.50! The food itself didn't quite hit the spots for me but that could be just me. I found the almond French toast a bit too overwhelmingly almondy and the Seitan meatloaf not all that great. I was mistakenly served the portabello burgundy which I took a bite before realizing it wasn't my order.. and that tasted pretty good! I wish I'd ordered that instead of my meatloaf. Almost all the items on their buffet were tending towards the sweeter side except the one pesto pasta salad and the hummus. That plus the French toast and sweetish rice-side to the French toast was way too much \"sweet\" for my brunch palette. I'd initially loved the look of all those options on the dessert table but when it came time for dessert, we'd had way too much \"sweet\" already in our food to be able to give all those dessert-cakes their due. I tasted the orange-chocolate cake and the raspberry-coconut cake and found them just about ok. The servers are friendly and polite. I'll go back to Zenith and try their other offerings..but I'll go back mainly to poke around their antique store while I do that and look around a bit more. There's a lot to take in and we almost missed the mannequin lying in a couch suspended from the ceiling above our table! Creepy... but also really cool! Gotta go back for more such interesting displays we may have missed on our first visit here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem tucked away in South Side. Doubling as a antique shop, the entrance can be miss leading but don't worry just walk straight back and you'll see a host stand.  I recommend going for brunch. For $11.50 you get to pick and item off the main menu and get an unlimited buffet full of a wide verity of foods from salads to peanut noodles to delicious bunt cakes. Usually they have around 6 different types of dessert cakes. Each one mouth drooling good. Oh and you get a drink such as a coffee or juice included. Crazy, right!?  So this places is completely 100 percent vegan. Go for brunch to get the buffet and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 8 for brunch - we had a diverse array of dietary preferences, ranging from gluten free, to completely meatless, and some who are avid carnivores. Overall, even the vegetarians were not ultra impressed. The bundt cake array was impressive, but none were world-rocking (honestly, there's only so much bundt cake one human can eat in a sitting). There was a dizzying quantity of noodles, some of which were pretty blasé. My favorite dish was a vegetable and sesame noodle combo, which was fairly flavorful. The salad was predominantly iceberg lettuce, which was disappointing for a vegan hipster joint like this, where I'd expect more interesting combinations of veggies. There was a farro salad with parsley that was acceptable, but I have had much, much better at pretty much every Middle eastern restaurant I've ever been too. Sadly, blandness was pretty much the status quo at the Zenith, where I'd expected a punch of flavor to round out the veggie/vegan fare.  I would have given the place 2 stars for a pretty uninspired showing of mostly noodle/bundt related items, but their quirky decor, fun aesthetic, and really tasty bottomless coffee for those waiting for a table - those made it a little less bland. One half extra star for ambiance, and one half extra star for being so committed to the vegan/vegetarian ideal, which is rare enough in Pittsburgh. I hope they improve their flavors.  Will I return again? Probably not. There are FAR better vegetarian and vegan restaurant in the 'Burgh. However, I'd recommend checking it out if you are looking for a quirky spot. It just probably won't top your list for places to return to frequently."}
{"text":"There is a line to get in, so go early. Upon entrance you walk through the antique collectibles and there are lots of them. Soon you enter into the dining rooms, set up in the middle of shop. The tables are set with antique dishes. The menu is a small card on the table. You order an an entree and the vegetarian buffet is included. The flavors are absolutely amazing. This is a hidden gem. Assorted bundt cakes for dessert, at least 15 to choose from....help yourself to deliciousness....."}
{"text":"So pleased now that I have finally tried this place. I am rarely in this area but now I will go out of my way to come eat here for Sunday Brunch. I had vegan French toast and it tasted like the simple and wonderful classic before Veganism. But the buffet did me dirty. The overwhelming joy consumed me as I ate all the different sides. There was some Asian peanut noodle dish kinda thing that really stood out for me. I'm still so full, probably won't eat til next Sunday so I can come back with an even bigger appetite."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of eating in a thrift store. If you can get over that, you'll probably enjoy it. I believe that their menu is 100% vegetarian.  I just couldn't get over the fact that I was eating amongst people's old possessions."}
{"text":"Ten bucks on a Sunday for an amazing buffet AND an entree, yes, please.  Look, I think it's simple: I ate here before bowling a perfect game of duckpins. Woody Harrelson also ate here a few weeks after I bowled. Ergo, Zenith is for \"Kingpin\"'s. Eating here makes you stay on top of your game. It's game changing. Life changing, even. When can I go back?"}
{"text":"My 19 year old son and I stopped in Pittsburgh on the way to Cleveland for a concert. I am a vegan and my son is limiting his meat intake so this place seemed perfect.  As we walked in one of the cooks asked us if we were looking for the buffet.  We weren't, and proceeded to seat ourselves.  I loved the eccentric vibe of Zenith and spent a few minutes walking around looking at all the cool stuff, much from my childhood! We started with the smoky potato soup, which was delicious.  I ordered the seitan sandwich and my son had the tacos.  The sandwich was okay and my son also said the same of his tacos.  The cook who greeted us when we came in came to our table and asked about how our soup was.  Then, she never left.  She actually stood there talking the entire time we were eating.  That alone will make me not go back.  But the food, it was just okay.  The soup was good, but the seitan was served as a gravy-covered sandwich on white bread.  As a vegan, I was supremely disappointed.  To me, being a vegan isn't just about not eating meat, its about eating healthily.  Why would I want a mushy gravy covered sandwich made with white bread, regardless of what was inside?  That sandwich would have been delicious served on brioche or focaccia with onions, sautéed mushrooms and garlic, topped with arugula.  Instead I got something barely edible with a staff person who needs to learn restaurant worker etiquette. I would not go back.  ."}
{"text":"I've gone here for dinner and now just recently for their brunch.  It's a small shop with antiques being sold in the front and the eating area in the back. The tables and chairs also seem like they are antique-like.  If you go for dinner, you get a much larger menu along with a large assortment of teas to choose from. Their menu changes seasonally as well.  For brunch, you get a buffet + entree + coffee/tea, all for $12. It is much busier during brunch, too. You have a variety to choose from for the buffet and the entrees, but the tea and coffee is only what they are currently brewing. You also get access to their cakes, which are quite delicious.  Overall, Zenith offers a unique atmosphere and a delicious variety of vegetarian options... also delicious tea! :D"}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE Zenith because as a pretty harcore carnivore, eating vegetarian is one way for me to try having an exotic culinary experience every now and then.  So one weekend when my veggie loving Mom was in town, we decided to hit the famed Sunday brunch at Zenith.    I must not have read the reviews here before I went, because I was shocked to see a line.  I didn't bother me though because I figured with a line that long waiting for the restaurant to open, it must be worth the wait!   What did truly dissapoint me was the seating arrangement.  I'm a perfectly sociable, friendly person and chatting with strangers of my own choice at a bar is great fun to me.  But one thing I was not prepared or excited to do was spend Sunday morning and the last morning of my mom's visit making small talk with strangers.  I realize this is Zenith's way of maximizing business and satisfying the long lines of people at the door.  But I would have appreciated at least some sign on the wall or something \"you will be making akward small talk with strangers over breakfast\" to warn me so that perhaps we could have headed to Tom's Diner instead where my mom and I could gossip about our crazy relatives in relative privacy.    I'm probably not the best judge being that I'm not vegan nor vegetarian, but I thought the food was delicious and so did my mom.  I don't remember what she ordered, but I had french toast with strawberries, I believe.  It was better than good...not awe-inspiring, but yummy.  What really delighted me was all the salads, the dolmatas, and the cakes.  My god, the cakes were delicious.  I could have had nothing but cake for brunch that day.    Overall, it was an interesting experience and I enjoyed the food.  The atmosphere...eh.  The service....eh.  I haven't been back since that visit which was a few months ago, and I don't really plan to go back in the very near future."}
{"text":"I've actually been coming to zenith even before I moved to Pittsburgh (I've lived here since July 2013). For the most part, as long as you don't mind sharing a table with other customers, you can get seated reasonably fast. All of their buffet and entree food has been delicious. One thing I do not like is that not all their entrees are vegan even though everything on the buffet is. Prices have gone up over the past years, but I totally understand that. This is an awesome place for brunch to bring \"out-of-towers\" because not only is it a restaurant but also an antique shop."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The waiting room is really an antique shop where you can buy most things on display. I will say the selection seemed to be aimed more toward women (loads of clothes such as dresses and shawls) but I found some old games and machines that were to my liking.   The dining area is nice. Homely, in the best sense of the word. The glassware didn't match, the silverware didn't match. The plates didn't match. I loved it. Think of an old artist grandmother's homestead. You can order food and--at least when I was there--they had a buffet set up, from which you can get side dish foodstuff. The vegetables and fruits were fresh and delicious. Most of them were in non-traditional dishes (i.e., different dressings, toppings, and whatnot). Great for people who love trying new foods.   The only issue I had was when seated, we were placed at a table that was occupied by a couple and their child. In some situations this sharing of tables could be beneficial, as I can imagine it might breed thoughtful conversation. But in this case, awkward silence was the only thing being birthed. Being placed by children is not ideal when you particularly dislike them and the constant kicking/whining/spilling that create.   Still, though. Overall, excellent."}
{"text":"Pros: Great and various food, attentive service, interesting decor  Cons: Not much except that you're in Pittsburgh not where I live now!!!  Tell me if I can find a place like this in the SF Bay Area.  I miss you, Zenith Tea Room!  I have only come here for the Sunday brunch which starts at 11 am.  This is one of the hidden treasures of Pittsburgh.  The entire brunch is vegan and also dangerously unhealthy (read: tons of sugary treats).  The buffet is flat-rate which includes the buffet, a choice of tea/drink and main dish (such as vegan french toast, if that's possible -- it's so awesome).  FOR TEN DOLLARS!  They use mismatched antiquey dishware and silverware.  And even the chairs don't match!  So in some way, it's like dining in an attic, but everything is tastefully selected.  Of course, this place being in the Southside means it's mostly hipsters that come this way.  But an incredible gem this is.  It's easy to get a table for less than 4...but huge parties, expect to wait.  I really need to come back here just for tea there.  They have an incredible tea list.  I personally love the darjeeling, but that's the staple for me."}
{"text":"Favorite Sunday brunch place in Pittsburgh for Vegans and Vegetarians. Love the vegan buffet and I could eat just that, but then you also get a great entree to choose from too. Try the green beans, sesame noodles, and the vegan deserts.    The only drawback is that sometimes the entree portions are too big. Don't take people take people who don't appreciate a diversion from the norm.   I really feel like I can get my fill for $10."}
{"text":"Love this place! Can't believe it took me so long to get here.  Came in on a Friday night. It was empty, which, compounded with the antiques everywhere, gave an initial creepy vibe.  I would place the aesthetic right on the spooky/cute border. I dig it.  The staff were extremely nice and attentive. Prices are very reasonable and portion size is great.  I ordered the stuffed grape leaves and the seitan sandwich. In my opinion, I was taking a risk: eating grape leaves at a non Mediterranean place could be disastrous, and I'm quite picky about seitan.  The risk totally paid off: the grape leaves were delicious, and the seitan sandwich was so good it's craveable. It invokes the taste and texture of a sloppy joe, with really great sauce and just the right amount of messiness. I know their menu rotates, so I'll be stalking it to see if the sandwich appears again.  I finished my meal with raspberry vanilla cake. The cake was so moist and great, and they put a berry sauce on it (it had a funny name that I can't remember) that took it to the next level.  In sum, a great spot for vegetarians/vegans and their omnivorous companions!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Pittsburgh for three months, and I've been wondering where all the hipsters are. I mean, I live in South Side. It shouldn't be that hard to spot one. Maybe I work too much, I thought. Maybe I need to spend more time in the Beehive instead of just getting my coffee to go. Or maybe the hipsters only come out during the day while I'm at work, like opposite vampires, and spend their nights sitting on someone's roof in Lawrenceville, drinking PBR ironically and discussing the importance of dialects in the cultural fabric of America while I sit at home and watch bad reality television.   And then I found them. In a line 35-deep snaking around Zenith at 10:45 AM on a Sunday. Success!  Despite the fact that standing outside amongst the cool kids made me feel like I was about to be picked last for dodgeball, I can understand why they flock to Zenith. The $10 vegetarian brunch at the restaurant/antique store is an open secret. Brunch starts at 11 AM and includes coffee or tea, a main entree, and a glorious buffet of vegan cakes, fruit, and vegetables. I had the vegan french toast with apple topping, which was delicious. Due to the popularity of brunch, Zenith will often sit multiple, smaller parties at large tables. My friend and I said hello to our fellow diners, but they were too engrossed in their banana pancakes to acknowledge their tragically unhip tablemates. No matter: the waiter was charming, the food tasty, and the price right. I've got nothing but love for Zenith, and me and my lame self will be back for many a Sunday to come."}
{"text":"I stopped in for brunch with Laura Sunday morning and had a fun time at this unique shop and restaurant. I live nearby, but never stopped in since  i wasn't too sure of what i would order since i am not vegetarian. I've been missing out! The shop itself as well as the decor in the dining room is totally cool. Laura & I were seated with a couple who were very friendly and seemed to come here often. We learned from them that the menu changes often, but the buffet is often the same.   The buffet had a mix of pasta salads, fruit, pastries as well as an entire table of bundt cakes. I sampled a few pastas as well as some fruit. I'm not sure what it was, but the pasta salad with peanut sauce was my favorite. Speaking of that, i wish they would put the name of  the pasta so we could remember it.. maybe even a list of what it consist of for example :)   For brunch, i ordered the almond french toast. It was super tasty as well as filling. My order came with two large pieces of french toast plus a side dish of rice (or something along those lines) I could only finish one piece of the french toast, but then again i sampled 3 pastas and some fruit from the buffet. The brunch menu states no to go boxes so i assumed that was both for the entree and buffet. FYI: one flat price ($11.50) equals an entree and unlimited trips to the buffet.   I'm sure I'll try the brunch here again since i live so close. It is also nice that the menu changes, so im excited to see what else is offered. my fiance is pretty open minded so he may like this place as well and he can tag along next time. We shall see."}
{"text":"Trying the brunch here at least once is a trivial MUST. It's worth it just to experience the novel concept of eating potluck style fare in a vintage shop. But when it comes down to it, Zenith's execution is very simple. The brunch buffet (only available on Sundays) is all vegan and exciting, but the food isn't really all that much fun. The cakes and pies are truly bad and the salads are average. When I say \"potluck style,\" I mean that this is the sort of food your plebeian friends or family prepare for parties - cheap and easy to make. The entrees are typically extremely uninspired, bland and obviously mass produced and re-heated as necessary. I would never even think of coming here on any day but Sunday (ok, well, I did once go on a Thursday; we were the only ones there and it sucked). I would give Zenith two stars, but I have to give them a little extra credit for business design - convincing people to crowd in one day of the week so as to require a wait during which people can shop deliriously (hungover and on an empty stomach) before eating. What they do the rest of the week is beyond me, it's definitely not creative menu design - I guess they are probably religiously hawking thrift store goods to re-sell..."}
{"text":"I visited the Zenith yesterday for Sunday brunch with fellow Yelper Chelsea S.  We'd been wanting to do brunch together for awhile, so I suggested the Zenith, since I knew it was near where she lives and I'd heard it was a really unique and cool brunch venue.  Although neither of us are vegetarian or had tried a vegetarian brunch before, we're both game to try new things, so we decided to check it out.  The first thing you notice when walking into the Zenith is the interesting kitschy antiques everywhere--including suspended from the ceiling.  Unlike the Beehive coffeeshop further down Carson St., which has similar interesting decor, it's my understanding that these items--as well as the tables, chairs, flatware, etc.--can be purchased.  I'm not sure of the range of prices, since I didn't inquire, though.  The second thing that became apparent, which I didn't realize from reading previous reviews, is that parties of two are mostly seated together with other pairs (i.e., communal/family style seating).  That wasn't a problem for us, since our tablemates were interesting conversation partners, but if you're a couple looking for an intimate/romantic brunch venue, you may wish to look elsewhere.  If, on the other hand, you're game for meeting new people, by all means, check it out!  As for ordering, the setup is a hybrid of a prix fixe and a brunch buffet.  All of the entrees, which change on a weekly basis, are the same price ($11.50), which also includes coffee or tea with unlimited refills.  (I had herbal tea.)  Once you order, you have access to the buffet tables, one of which focuses on salads and fruit/vegetable side dishes, and the other of which contains an assortment of bundt cakes.  For my entree, I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I was expecting wafer-thin flapjacks, but they turned out to be quite thick, moist, and cakey--in a good way. This entree was proof that vegetarian fare can be quite filling!  I wasn't as much of a fan of the side dish that came with it (not sure what exactly it was), but it added some welcome savoriness.  As it were, my selections from the vegetable buffet table added the savoriness I needed to offset the sweetness of the pancakes.  They included pasta salad, thai peanut noodles (?), chickpea salad, spinach salad, a piece of bread, and some fruit, as well.  All of them were quite good, and also filling in their own right.  Finally, I sampled several of the bundt cakes (double chocolate, vanilla blueberry, poppy seed lemon, and orange lavender (?)).  While I enjoyed all of them, too, my favorite was the double chocolate, due to its moistness. If you don't have as much of a sweet tooth as me, you may prefer some of the other flavors, which were less sweet.  I'm definitely glad that I tried the Zenith's brunch buffet, since it's one of the most unique brunches in PGH, for sure.  Even if you're leery of vegetarian food, I'd encourage you to check it out--I daresay you'll be pleasantly surprised!  And, of course, it was great to share the experience with a fellow Yelper (Chelsea S.), as well as our table mates, and make some new friends while enjoying a delicious brunch!"}
{"text":"I'm a hardcore carnivore, especially when it comes to brunch, so I was skeptical of Zenith. It was better than I thought it would be.  The vegetable stew I got was pretty good, but nothing special, and it would have been greatly improved by a good helping of slow-cooked beef (sorry, it's true!). I had a bite of the pasta and it was beyond bland, whereas the french toast (strawberry that morning) was far too sweet. Essentially, I could have done without the entrees altogether.  The buffet portion of the meal was much better. A large selection of salads, dips, and such, and of course those peanut noodles. Everyone raves about them but guess what? They are super easy to make at home! Just search \"peanut butter noodles\" in Google and you'll get a million recipes. There you go, your reason for going to Zenith is no longer (and most of the other buffet items are just as easily imitable). I do have to say that the dessert buffet was very impressive. Pies, cakes, breads...I am not a dessert person at all but I just had to sample everything. If you are a dessert person, you will probably be in heaven.  I wouldn't be against coming back here again (can you BYOBacon??) but there are so many other good brunch spots in the city that I might not get around to it."}
{"text":"I don't get to the South Side much so I've only been there once, but I was really impressed. This would be a great place to take my parents I think.  The decor and common tables (not all the tables are common) are just different enough that my parents would feel uncomfortable.  Yea, and my dad would definitely think he's going to go away hungry, which he won't (his comment whenever I say I want to go to a vegetarian restaurant is that he doesn't want to b/c he's rather hungry).    Anyhow, they use great ingredients and the prices are good."}
{"text":"The Zenith is all about atmosphere. But it has great food, too-- and at a good price, which is a rare combination. Most of the other reviewers talked about Sunday brunch, but I've always dined during 'off' hours, finding myself the only person there at times. When it's not busy, it's a good place to wander around looking at art and antiques while waiting for your food. I would compare it to eating lunch in my grandmother's attic. The sort of place where I might have sneaked into to have elaborate tea parties as a child. It's a nice sense of whimsy.  There is an extensive tea list, many of which are interesting herbal mixes named after times and places (Wild West is my favorite). I used to buy the dry tea from them years ago, but I don't think they sell it like that anymore.  The food is always great and often creative, with ample portions.  It's definitely starch-heavy though, with most of the dishes being based around sandwich bread, pasta or rice, and I haven't recently been there to find out if substitutions (like salad instead of rice) are ok. Their vegan desserts, especially the cakes, are to-die-for and alone are worth the trip.  It's one of my favorite places to take people from out of town because it's something that I don't think people really expect from Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"As a meat-eater with a vegetarian sister and a vegan best friend, I often find myself searching for places that will satisfy both me and the ones I love. Let me tell you--Zenith is it! Best time to go is on Sunday mornings for their enormous brunch-y buffet!! Peanut sauce noodles, stuffed grape leaves, delicious green beans (how do they make them taste so good!??) and a huge assortment of cakes for dessert. You will not leave hungry! Just about everything is vegan and I do not miss the meat/dairy at all. All the food is full of flavor and truly tasty! The owner also get a special coffee blend from La Prima that is awesome.   Did I mention this place is also an antique shop? As if it couldn't get any cooler, you can browse and peruse the extensive shop before or after you eat, or you can come in just to shop! I could easily spend a whole day in Zenith, shopping, eating, shopping again--and maybe then some more eating. Great place to take anyone who is looking for an out-of-the-box Pittsburgh experience."}
{"text":"You want to talk about a hidden gem, well this place is it! The pass 2 years my girlfriend and I have been doing a vegan diet and The Zenith is the perfect place to go to pig out on vegan goods!  Our 1st visit there, I was surprised upon entry at all the antiques and what seemed like ancient furniture all over the place! Certainty a retro vibe going on, didn't mind it not one bit. As you walk through all the fun decors, you make your way to the dining area. Almost felt like grandmas house with all the fabric table mats.   My girlfriend and I were quickly greeted by a nice waitress who took our order and insisted we hit the buffet! We both went with the pancakes! So good and tasty because it comes with this strawberry jelly on the side. Also, served with seasoned brown rice. Surprisingly, a nice combination of sweet and savory. Pancakes were great, but the real highlight is the buffet!  This vegan buffet is the best I have ever seen! There is a mixture of noodle and veggie pastas to choose from, the peanut butter noodle (my gf's favorite) and they usually have a few different spinach base salads. My favorite had to be the pesto spiral noodle pasta with tomatoes and veggies. Hands down the best part of the buffet are the desserts! I have never seen as many vegan sweet treats in my life. This day they had; lemon poppy seed cake, hazelnut coffee cake(unbelievable) and three other cakes to pick from. I'm greedy at buffets so I tried them all :)   What really puts a cherry on top for The Zenith for me, are the take home boxes! Each time we visited, it was close to there closing time. As it gets closer to time, the waitress will eventually come around and offer take home boxes for the guests still eating. Not only is that good to cut down on waste, but that means we get to take as much vegan goods home as we can! In case, you were curious, my box was full of cake!  I recommend The Zenith for anyone who wants to try something different. You do not have to be vegan to eat here and enjoy good food. If you still aren't sold on the food or the wonderful cakes, they also have eggs on the menu! Go visit!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic but I just can't get over the old things laying around; it feels dirty and moldy, I almost lost my appetite."}
{"text":"My mother was in town and we decided to check out a vegetarian restaurant nearby. I don't know if we went in the wrong entrance, as we followed the google directions to the address listed, but we walked into a old retro antique shop with the name of the restaurant on the front door, that smelled and the windows had so much paint and dust I wouldn't eat there if my life depended on it. It smelled like food but the place was so creepy we walked back out and looked for another entrance. After walking around the block for 15 minutes and not being able to figure out if there was another entrance or not, we decided to go to a different restaurant. They need to update their sign/entrance info. or if we were in the right place, do not go there. Definitely not up to health code. BTW there were mannequin parts with just hands or legs."}
{"text":"After a bit of deliberation, I decided Zenith is fully deserving of five stars.  The key to this justification is to remember the restaurant title \"Vegetarian CAFE\".  I will explain later...  Upon entering Zenith, and as is well documented by the pictures, one is greeted by the warehouse everyone's mother would love to have!  Antiquities all over the place and those are extremely fairly priced as my mother-in-law was so elated to find.  After a short wait, we were ushered into our table for Sunday brunch.  As I said, Zenith only claims to be a Vegetarian Cafe and, as such, goes above and beyond that claim but may fall short of a full fledged restaurant.  The salad bar is superfluous, while possibly a bit monotone in ingredients (pasta, veg, beans, pasta, veg, beans) with 10-12 different pasta and green salads.  There were two flavors of bread and then a menu of 6 entrees for only $10/person."}
{"text":"Vintage and vegetarian! This place was so great, glad I visited. I'm in town for work and stumbled across this gem. Quirky, offbeat, and authentic with good music. I had the tofu salad sandwich which was surprisingly tasting (think egg salad with apples and celery). Also, picked up a cool knock-knack and the generous owner threw in a book I liked. There was also a whole table of homemade cakes which looked so yummy."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for a snack - neither of us were overly hungry so we opted for the Mediterranean plate.  It had hummus, pita bread, grape leaves, feta cheese, red peppers, olives...those are all the items I can remember.    I thought everything tasted good and fresh.  I remember liking the hummus.  I would have never thought there was a restaurant hidden in this antique store.  We walked through the antique/thrift store to get to the restaurant, I don't remember seeing another way to access the restaurant portion.  The ambiance is very quirky, maybe b/c there's alot of people's old stuff all around, but it works.  I'm not sure that I'd always be in the mood for something like this, but stopping in for a mid-afternoon snack just clicked.    I'd like to go back and try some meals as these reviews have me curious!"}
{"text":"Here it is my 100th review here on my favorite website. If any place is deserving of being my big milestone review it's Zenith.  While I'd been there more than once before, it had been too long and I didn't think I could accurately review it without more recent research being done. (Which is a great excuse for me to go back and have brunch again and again and again. I am a research assistant extraordinaire.) Let's take two things I love thrifting/antiques and brunch and smash them all together into one Sunday morning good time.   The interior of this store/restaurant is so full of interesting bits that there are things literally hanging from the ceiling. When you walk into the main room it's almost a feeling of sensory overload. So many fun items to look at and touch. You can buy everything, right down to the chair you sit in while you eat and the dishes you use. It's not particularly a perfect place for preschoolers though as some pieces are precariously perched and practically praying to be pushed over. (Like that alliteration I used there? Priceless!) Just one hiccup, a lot of items have no prices on them and I'm not really sure where you take an item you want to purchase.  It's best to get there before they open at 11am as a line begins to form immediately. For $10 you get to pick an entree (of which they have 5 or 6 options which change each week), hot or cold tea or coffee, and access to the buffet. The options are vegan or vegetarian and they always have fresh fruit and fresh baked breads. The dessert table is usually various pies and bundt cakes. The flavors are great and subtle too.  It's a small space so if you're claustrophobic or don't like beat sat with strangers this most likely isn't for you. They do take cards or cash so you're safe either way.   If you're looking for a unique brunch experience you'll want to make the Southside a stop off."}
{"text":"Zenith Antiques is one of my favorite vegetarian places in Pittsburgh. I am not a huge fan of the eclectic decor but it doesn't bother me either. I agree with the other reviewers that say good things about their tea selection."}
{"text":"All I could say the whole time was \"why haven't we come here sooner?\" The Sunday brunch is seriously awesome. I was shocked at the spread of amazing gluten free bunt cakes, and flavorful vegetarian side dishes came as part of the meal! I wanted to try everything. It was all incredibly good. I could go here every Sunday. I had a vegan almond French toast that was super delicious, it had a mixed berry topping and a side dish with a yummy curry flavor. Great portions plus the buffet I left more than full. The self serve free coffee is yet another bonus. The only thing that might not be for everyone is that you may have to sit at a table with strangers. It gets quite busy and they have larger tables but I didn't mind. Great prices. The atmosphere is so cool. This place is really a unique experience. We spent awhile waking around the antique store after. I love the vibe, you can find hidden treasures all over the place. One time here is not enough."}
{"text":"My new favorite brunch spot in the 'burgh!  It's all vegetarian, and sooo good.  Definitely worth waiting in the line that forms before this place opens up on Sunday.  You pick an entree, usually there are french toast and scramble options--last time I went, there was even a BBQ seitan sandwich.  I went with lemon artichoke stew, which was heavenly.  There are also different herbal teas, juices, and coffee to choose as a beverage.  The best part is the buffet line--close to 30 different salads (veggie, pasta, and fruit) to choose from and a whole table full of pies and cakes.   The dishes are fiestaware and different antique pitchers and glasses from the Zenith's antique store.  The atmosphere is cute and kitschy, and you can buy any of the art on the walls.  I will definitely be back for brunch on future Sundays, I might even try lunch or dinner here as well.  The Zenith is a great little place!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Sunday with my wife and sister for brunch.  We were not originally planning on coming here and after having to call an audible we arrived shortly before 11 to find a huge line outside of Zenith.  It was large enough that I was concerned we weren't going to get seated in the first wave of people for brunch.  Having been here a couple of times before I knew that if we didn't make it into that first wave then we could be in for a long wait.  Thankfully we eventually did make it and were seated at a table for six.  Zenith is quite interesting in that they have a number of tables in the dining room but they are all communal tables and so they pack in as many people as they can.  As such the three of us ended up sharing our table with another couple and a regular.  The inside of Zenith is quite different than any other restaurant you have ever been to before.  The front of the store also happens to be a thrift/antique store which you can peruse either while you wait or after your meal.  That store happens to spill into the restaurant as well and there are numerous random items around you that are on sale.  On my most recent visit two of the more random items were a 4 feet tall cardboard cutout of Santa that I was sitting next to and then a couch with a naked mannequin on it which was high up in front of our table.  The bathroom that I used here was also somewhat creepy as it had hundreds of owls in it all of which were sort of watching you while you did your business.  All of this was mentioned not to say anything bad about Zenith but merely to point that it is different which ends up being part of the charm of Zenith.  If you have never been to brunch here before you get a drink (coffee/tea/iced tea), access to the buffet and then a entree item all for a single price.  The buffet is where I think that Zenith really shines.  It has a large number of cold salads, some bread and finally a number of different cakes and pies on it.  During this visit I was able to try an array of different items and the ones that really stood out for me were the grape leaves, a green potato dish (sorry they don't have names or descriptions on the cold salad items) and finally the vanilla cake.  Where I think Zenith is less successful is their entree items.  On this visit I ended up choosing the homemade beefy seitan sandwich with lettuce and vegan mayo as my entree.  I don't know what I was really expecting here but it wasn't the shaved seitan sandwich that resembled a roast beef sandwich.  Even so I dove into it and I ended up thinking that the seitan in this sandwich tasted somewhat weird.  I have had seitan in many forms before and normally really enjoy it but for some reason this one just didn't do it for me.  Neither did the rice side that came with all of their entrees and was left by almost every person at our table.  With all of that being said I think that I chose poorly for my entree as I was able to try my wife's jakarta wrap which was really delicious.  It consisted of sweet and spicy tofu, fresh spinach, shredded carrots, raisins, sunflower seeds and peanut sauce with the tofu rightfully being the star of the dish.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future.  While I hate having to get here early and wait outside for brunch, I think that it is well worth it and that Zenith is a brunch place that every Pittsburgher should try at least once!"}
{"text":"Cheap, big buffet of vegan items, unique experience. There might be a bit of a wait, but at least you're in a vintage store so you can look around."}
{"text":"The Zenith is one of my favorite brunch spots ever. Not only is the food fantastic, but the restaurant doubles as a unique antique shop and there are tons of things to look at. If you have no attention span, you'll definitely be a fan!  I've been going to Zenith for a few years now, and I even follow their Instagram account to peep the weekly menu. My favorites are their lentil burgers (best vegan mayo in town) and the almond pancakes. On my last visit a couple weekends ago I got almond French toast that came with some delicious, sweet blueberry syrup. The buffet is only $11.50 for tea or coffee, a buffet of cakes and different cold salads, and your choice of an entree. It's a steal for the amount of food you get. Also, who doesn't love a bar of cakes?  Zenith is in the South Side of Pittsburgh, and if you are visiting the area it's a great place to shop around after eating. The antiques here are fun to look at and you may be able to take something unique home. Even if you don't adopt the vegan or vegetarian diet you'll leave here happy and full!"}
{"text":"Very specially place! Check the review first and then decide to visit instantly. It's turn out its a very specially spot, especially suitable for vegetarians!!! Although it's a little salty yet still delicious! Strong recommend tofu sandwich!"}
{"text":"So great!!! I'd been wanting to go for awhile, just based on the reviews and the tales that spoke of an all vegetarian brunch place with an antique store in the waiting area (my dream come true?).  The Zenith lived up to every wild expectation I could have. They sat us fairly quickly considering we came during the busiest Sunday brunch time. Interestingly, we could've been sat immediately if we agreed to share a table with another couple who were regulars. The hostess explained some people love it, others would rather eat alone; personal preference!  Excellent, attentive service. You order a main dish, which is accompanied by a buffet to the side with all the delicious side dishes you could want! Ridiculously quickly our server brought us out our entrees. I got the banana pancakes with syrup which was paired with an Indian tasting rice. Such an unusual, surprisingly perfect combination!   I will admit the coffee was not good, but the rest more than made up for it!! I will absolutely be going on the regular."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegan/vegetarian place hidden in the back of an antique shop. We went there for brunch and enjoyed the $10 entree/drink/buffet.   Great layout on the buffet.   Friendly service.  Fast delivery of entrees.  Great ambiance.   Good music playing in the background.   Cool antiques out front!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend from out of town with another vegan friend, and she took us here for Sunday brunch. It is hands down my favorite place and I wish they had one in NY/CT! We got there early to make sure we could get a seat since the line apparently gets long. The brunch included an entree PLUS the brunch. That was definitely more food than needed, I would have been happy with just the brunch, but wanted to try the entree as well. So I tried to take tiny portions of the brunch food just to get a taste.  The setting was super cute too! Very quirky and fun. The prices were a great deal too. I had to drive around a block for parking but found parking on the street. I hope to go back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with vegan food we had excellent service and everybody was very friendly. The atmosphere is cozy and romantic."}
{"text":"Went a Saturday evening, the place was empty as we walked in and no one greeted us at the door. We walked through to the dining area where one other table was eating. They were out of 5 meals on the small menu and the taste of what we got seemed like it was old and/or previously frozen. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Really unique place to eat. I'm not vegetarian but loved it. Cool atmosphere. Great value for the price."}
{"text":"I want to LOVE Zenith. I go there about every 6 months, and I try again, harder each time, to like Zenith. It's an antique shop, and I love antiques! They serve vegan and veggie food, which I love! They are known for their brunch - my lifelong favorite meal! i know everyone loves zenith because it is part antique shop and part vegan restaurant, and there is a buffet of vegan sides, salads, and vegan cakes, and you get a vegan entree, coffee/tea, AND buffet for only $10 on a sunday morning, and a lot of the salads/buffet items are delicious. i respect all of these reasons for loving Zenith.  And yet, I consider Zenith to be the biggest sore disappointment in my Pittsburgh experience.   First of all, I hate waiting in lines. I hate that you have to time the exact moment of your arrival (to beat everyone else) and wait for Zenith to start seating. or you can arrive when they are open, and wait in a 30 person line to be seated.  i cannot express how deeply this irritates me.   I hate sitting cafeteria style at tables with strangers -- okay, honestly, I don't hate strangers, but I do hate non-consensual seating with ex-girlfriends, ex-friends, ex-co-workers, and other parties from the past I'd rather put to bed. Pittsburgh is an awful small town for such a big city, certainly I can't be the only one wishing those demons would stay somewhere far away from my brunch table?  Third, their table service is perhaps near the lowest-ranking in the city. If it is 90 degrees in June, and people are sitting in an un-air-conditioned room, with one lazy ceiling fan, and your server literally cannot bring you a glass of water.... well, there's a serious problem.   and finally, the food. The brunch buffet salads/sides are sometimes \"Good\" but mostly mediocre, and i don't think the entrees are ever very good.   We have a problem where we conflate quantity & quality. Our collective vegan brunch love for Zenith is exactly this issue. As vegans, you are not used to seeing a table full of cake you can eat. So when you do see that, you will rave about it. Even if the cake is dry and flavorless, you will eat it, and you will go back for seconds."}
{"text":"I've only ever been to the brunch but - my god, I would eat here every Sunday morning if I could get my lazy butt out of the house on time...  Zenith is where hipster goes to die (I mean- it's connected to an antique store, there are Christmas lights all year round, local artists decorate the walls with their art, etc.)  The service is fast and the entree is usually good! If it's your first time I'd stay away from the bottom of the menu where they get more \"adventurous.\" And hey - if the entree isn't good there's an entire side buffet and bundt cake buffet awaiting your hungry selves.    I could go on, but you'd have to experience the hipster glory of Zenith yourself."}
{"text":"After reading about the mention in the New York Times, I decided to give Zenith a try for lunch, even though it's highly noted for its brunch.  We entered the antique store and were greeted by a woman who told us to choose a table for lunch. I chose a table for us by the space heater since the large room was a little drafty. It wouldn't be a problem through the meal since the meal came with a delicious miso soup that warmed me right up. I had the linguine which was good and my dad had the seitan beef which was really good, and for the price you really can't beat it.  But the real joy of eating here is the environment. There are antiques everywhere including the table settings. The music is an ecclectic mix. And the owner was a woman who came over and talked with us, and she really made our dining experience special. You can tell she really cares about her customers, and she takes into account the mostly younger clientel, although for lunch all the other couples were very much out of college.   I would very much recommend making a stop here for lunch or brunch if you're in the area. Very much worth it."}
{"text":"Probably the best vegan place I have ever eaten!  Zenith is located in the back of a vintage shop, which really confused me. After walking past all of the interesting, eclectic selection of things one could buy before or after a delicious vegan meal, you'll find the open seating area for the restaurant. They have unique decor that will keep your eyes wandering, and would certainly make for interesting conversations.  The food is presented in a self-serve 'buffet' style. What can be frustrating is that things can run out, but their selection is so broad that you'll never find your plate empty less you've had your fill. Salads and desserts are incredible. I've only been twice and am always looking for more opportunities to take friends who have never been.  Overall, a hidden gem that must be checked out, even if you're a carnivore!!"}
{"text":"This is a review of Zenith Antiques' Sunday brunch:  Wow. This is a truly unique place. We woke up Sunday and our Air B&B host asked us if we're vegetarian. Mostly? Then we *must* go to Zenith for brunch.  We parked nearby - I love how easy it is to find parking in Pittsburgh - and walked in the nondescript entrance to a hugely colorful thrift/antique store with chairs hanging from the ceiling, tapestries, old paintings, and gadgets and (mainly) funky items galore. It took us a few moments to figure out we had to advance to the back to get seated. We were only two, and so we were seated immediately at a larger table with a few others.   Since the main brunch item is the buffet, we walked over and stocked up, only to be asked upon returning to our seats what we wanted to eat. Ummm, the food we just picked up? Except you get an entree, too. Coffee or tea, a very nice brunch replete with bundt cakes (eight? ten? moist and delicious) and an assortment of salads (lentil, vegetable, Israeli couscous, pasta) and fruit, AND an entree. $10. I'm sure they make a killing on Sunday mornings (especially with a simple menu and no to-go boxes, probably to discourage taking more than you will actually eat from the buffet), but I thought this was amazing for a satisfying brunch.  Everything appears to be vegetarian, with a number of vegan options. My entree was nothing to write home about, but it was not bad: I had a solid burrito with rice, beans, pepper, onion, and pineapple, though I probably should have asked for no tortilla. Lots of rice and a tortilla always seemed funny to me. I'm not gluten-free, and I've only gone this once, but I get the impression that there are plenty of buffet and entree options for those who cannot eat gluten or wheat. But if you can! - I loved the almond-chocolate bundt cake and my husband was making happy noises while eating other bundt cakes and his chosen entree: apple pancakes. The brunch menu of the week is available here: http://zenithpgh.com/brunch-menu.  Our table companions were friendly and local, and told us that the room in which the buffet is located was used to be an art gallery. Perhaps it still is. It does appear to contain more contemporary work.   The service was great, especially considering the tightly packed setting: water jugs are available on the table, and our tea was refilled as often as we liked. There was no problem getting the check when we were ready to leave, and I was happy to discover they take credit cards.   Highly recommended for a relaxed and filling meal."}
{"text":"Best. Brunch. Ever!  And the most unique dining experience I've ever had. You order a vegetarian entree, go get delicious vegetarian salads and desserts, have coffee, then your entree comes.   It's hard to know what's better: the food or the atmosphere. Either way, I'll be hitting this place up a lot.  Bring your appetite though. Since it's buffet-style, there aren't to-go boxes."}
{"text":"Love this place. All vegan deliciousness. You get an entree with the buffet for a great deal. I had the seitan pot roast which was extremely tasty. Everything on the buffet was delicious, including the desserts. Sure made up for my last vegan meal.   I highly recommend this cute, artsy place and will certainly come here again."}
{"text":"A vegan place in Southside with quirky (weird?) decor. I tried the chicken soup and tacos with refried beans. I liked both!"}
{"text":"Zenith is seriously one of the best places that I have ever been. On Sundays there is an all you can eat vegetarian buffet. There is hummus, macaroni salad, tabbouleh, and about five different dessert items to choose from. I think that all the desserts are vegan too. That would be enough for $10, but no, you get to choose a hot entree and a tea. I got blueberry pancakes that were to die for. It's such a great concept. Also progressive is their seating policy. If you have 3 people in your party and another party has two in their party and a table for five happens to open up, you may be sat with another group. It was a wee bit awkward at first but we started talking and made food friends. I seriously loved this place and I'm so glad that Natalia took me there.  Since there is generally a long wait, the fact that the waiting area doubles as an amazing thrift store makes it an easy wait. The awkward part is carrying all the stuff you want to buy into the dining area and then finding a safe place for it until you pay. Few things have prices on them but it's not an arm and a leg for most things. I wound up with some Japanese owl coffee cups from the 70's and some vintage wild floral printed fabric."}
{"text":"Well this place is amazing. Had brunch and everything was so good! My suggestion is order something sweet as your main dish because most things on the buffet are savory (other than the table of cakes that is). That said I had a Malkin Melt as my main, it was delicious and I don't regret getting it. All of the pasta salads are wonderful, the potato salad is a little different but very tasty, dolmas are excellent. The cakes and pie are superb - my favorite was the hot chocolate (the spicy kick was so good!).  Go with an open mind. The vibe reminds me of another off beat vegan spot in Connecticut named Bloodroot, though this place has a feeling all its own. If the decor doesn't keep you entertained the random people you may be seated with will. Oh and the price can't be beat! All this for $11.50 is incredible."}
{"text":"A friend took me to The Zenith yesterday for brunch. After hearing about it for awhile and how much of a hipster mecca it was, I was a bit apprehensive and had flashbacks of the morning brunch sketch from Portlandia. Thankfully there was no line wrapped around the building and we only had about a 10 minute wait.   We were seated at a table with two other couples. I didn't realize it would be communal dining, but luckily the other diners were cool and kept to themselves. I could see it being a problem for some, though (groups with kids, etc).   The deal for Sunday brunch was incredible: coffee or tea, an entree, and the buffet all for only $10. The entree I had (Almond Pancakes) wasn't anything remarkable. In fact, I didn't even finish it because they were dry and missing that sort of richness I usually crave in a good pancake. HOWEVER, the brunch buffet was FANTASTIC!  There was a homemade baked cake/bread table, full of yummy looking bundt-cake type of things. I'm not into sweets, but I tasted a small piece of banana raspberry bread and it was delish. I got my fill on the savory side of the buffet: spicy asian flavored green bean salad, a rotini pesto salad, the homemade hummus that is probably the best I've ever tasted, and much much more. In the future, I think I may skip the entree and just veg out (excuse my pun) on the buffet.   I was certainly full after leaving here, and not in the gross way that sometimes comes from places where they use a bunch of processed canned nonsense from Sysco. This place certainly did fresh vegetarian food correctly, unlike it's competitors across town (ahem, Quiet Storm).   The only thing that would make this place better is air conditioning. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This place is about more than the food for most people that go there and love it. An for a certain hipstery set Zenith is like moths to a flame.  For the rest of us though Zenith is an antique shop with mediocre food and ok service,  It's held up to be something more than it is for those of us just looking for a decent meal."}
{"text":"When you walk into Zenith, you find yourself in an 'antique store'.  I feel like I'm being sort of generous referring to this as an antique store ... it's more accurately a thrift/vintage/junk store full of run down stuff.  I'm all about impulse buys normally but there was nothing I was tempted to even touch.  If you are waiting to be seated, there are a few couches that look like they're from the 60s and 70s to sit on.  The dining area consists of around 10 old family dining room tables and is filled with mismatched cabinets displaying more 'antiques'.    Zenith is CHEAP.  $10 at brunch gets you a warm entree, a drink, and unlimited stuff from the buffet.  Their pomegrante iced tea is wonderful.  Zenith uses these funky 'antique' glasses that vary from table to table.  They're a lot of fun.  I didn't mind the cafeteria style communial dining tables - though it may be less OK depending on who you're stuck with.  That being said, I was disappointed with the food at Zenith.  This is very standard fare vegetarian food and it's nothing special.  There were 6-8 warm entrees to choose from at brunch (scrambled eggs, pancakes, lemon linguine, and a curry burrito to name a few) and the two I sampled were just average.  The buffet consisted of the usual standard cold vegetarian food (grape leaves, fruit, cake, and too many variations of tabouli salad) and none of it was better than stuff I buy premade at the local organic store.  It's not especially fresh but it's decent.    Now for what I disliked about Zenith.    1)  People, let's talk about climate control!  I can't say I have ever been more eager to finish at a restaurant so I can go outside to the 90+ degree heat to cool down.  They've got a series of fans but it is in no way comfortable inside when it's warm outside.    2)  This place has old, white exposed rafters and it looks like the paint is peeling or something.  I spent a fair amount of time wondering how much of it falls down into the dining room ... and the kitchen.  3)  I was not impressed with the open closet (or whatever it was) with cans of paint/stain haphazardly stacked by the door.  Call me weird, but I like to pretend there are more than 30 feet separating my food and whatever restoration project you're working on.  Just close the door!  4)  Like another reviewer, I'm one of those annoying people with food allergies.  The buffet is basically an epipen salesman's dream.  It's full of all sorts of food allergens, it's all unlabeled and it's potentially dangerous.  There were a few things I didn't dare go near because I couldn't tell what was in them.    My last bit of commentary on Zenith has to do with the vibe.  I spent quite a bit of time on my trip back trying to decide how to describe the people here.  The best way I can think to word this is that it feels like the hot spot for the art folks.  It's a bit like the tortured artists meeting the hippies.  Completely unique ... but sort of odd if you don't fit into that category.    I'm really torn as to how to rate something as unique as Zenith.  I feel like if you're going to have a vegetarian restaurant, you need to do vegetarian food well.  For cheap, average and very basic vegetarian food in an unique environment, it gets 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"The Zenith uses white,  not raw or other natural,  sugar in their desserts.  White sugar often has animal bone char in it (about 50%of the time,  it's not labeled,  ya da ya da - if you don't know,  Google it)... thus, anything with sugar in it at Zenith is not veg or vegan.  Sorry folks.  We asked one of the cooks... She said that the desserts were made from \"regular\" sugar. That being said,  the atmosphere is awesome as is the store.  For that,  they get 2 stars from me.  But,  you simply can't call yourself a vegetarian or vegan restaurant when you serve desserts that contain white processed sugar :("}
{"text":"Zenith provides a delightful brunch experience. For $10 you really can not beat it for the following reasons;   1. All you can eat vegan buffet! They have various salads, pastas, hummus & bread! Every time I've gone they've been a little different but mainly the same. My absolute favorite are the peanut butter noodles, I could eat a large bowl of it but am forces to save room for other treats. On the other end of the buffet are vegan breads they always have 5 to 6 seasonally included favors...I look forward to these!   2. Not only do you get the buffet you get to choice an entree from a list. They options sometimes very but seem to always have eggs, French toast or a curry burritto. Among other options. I've tried most of them, all good! It's not by means the best vegan or vegatarian  food I've had but it's completely worth the money! I always leave full & satisfied  3. It's an antique shop! If you have to wait for a table there's plenty to look at. I've even made a few purchases. Some of its over priced but I can usually find a cheaper nik nak or a retro scarf. Also because it is an antique shop...all the dishware, tables, chairs & decor are unique. They also have large tables for big groups!   So I  recommend zenith for a wonderful sunday brunch"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and it really is all about the atmosphere! I loved it because its vegetarian and its hard to find a menu you can order anything off of. My favorite part: the deserts!!! SUUUPER YUMMMM!!!! Anyway, go to zenith, it's not boring and the food is good."}
{"text":"This place is vegetarian heaven! The atmosphere is very cool and hipster, as it is also an antique shop! If a vintage piece catches your eye, you can buy it! Delicious food, tasty cake, and the best veggie buffet to grace the South Side. I wish there was a \"buffet only\" option on the menu as I waste most of my \"meal\" because I really only want the salads & cakes... THE CAKES. Holly Guacamole guys, the cakes are amazing. Last visit I was there on my birthday and bought myself a picture as a present. Met one of the owners and he couldn't be nicer. My only complaint is that the place is so popular, the service can be very slow and you can expect long wait times for a table. However, the food is worth the wait. I will be back. Again and Again and Again!"}
{"text":"I went to this place once, and I have been dying to go back ever since. I thought it was a very unique eating experience, I loved the whole vintage/antique store aspect of it. Not to mention the food was cheap & really yummy. $10 for entree, drink + brunch buffet! I only went for brunch, I heard it is more expensive for dinner during the weeknights... But I enjoyed the atmosphere and experience, although it was a hard to find location, tucked away on the back side of a building."}
{"text":"Walk in, wait five minutes..but hey look at cool antiques/vintage items. I was excited!  Sit down with others at one table.  Okay, I'm chatty.  My friend and I tried to sit next to the couple and were informed that we should leave a seat in between...hmmm...social?  Really?  Told the waitress we had never been there.  My friend wasn't really that hungry, so the idea of a full entree for brunch didn't appeal to her.  I ordered almond french toast with raspberry sauce...we were going to share (didn't understand it was a buffet).  The waitress \"kindly\" informed us that we would have to be charged for two people.  Okay, fine, that's legit.  So my friend and I decided to eat what we could...get our money's worth!  We're eating the french toast...the waitress scurries over...\"I'm going to have to charge you for two if she keeps eating\".  What?  We thought you were anyway.    Apparently my friend and I go from restaurant to restaurant trying to cheat them out of as much money as possible.  Soggy french toast and a catty waitress...no thanks...I'm good.  P.S.  I really tried to give it a chance...but I suppose my hipster status isn't solid enough."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews so knew pretty much what I was in for. Kind of like going on a roller coaster for the first time but knowing what to expect because you spent months talking to your friends about it.  I thought the experience was pretty cool, perhaps ghoulishly cool.  We parked around the corner, and once we were on the street we walked right past it.  There isn't a sign or anything but because of all the pictures on yelp I recognized it just as I passed it.  We walked in, and right into what could be an art exhibit.  Or a garage sale, depending on your point of view.  Even the bathrooms are loaded with stuff.  Other restaurants that use pieces of Americana as decor are mere imitators of this place.  The Zenith is the real McCoy.   Now about the food:  I was there on a Saturday, and had the wheat berry salad.  It was large, and filled me up.  It tasted good and I was pleased with it.  I will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Wait time was deplorable. We left after 2 hours it was completely outrageous. We heard good things about the food and we were sad we werent able to try it. But a wait of more than 1 hour is unrealistic. I strongly encourage nobody to come here unless you want to be neglected by the staff"}
{"text":"Long-time vegetarians have learned to be suspicious of buffets. What's okay for me to eat? Is there any meat lurking in that innocuous-looking pasta? A vegetarian buffet is like a dream come true. A vegetarian buffet (+ entree  + coffee/tea) for 10 bucks is a dream come true for a girl who just finished grad school and needs to find a job.  Zenith, you're a dreamboat.   The entire store and dining area is super charming with antiques everywhere. Even the water glasses are fancy. Bonus points for having water pitchers on each table. The buffet can be divided into two categories--savory and sweet. On the savory side, there's bread and an array of bean salads, pasta salads, hummus, and other vegetable dishes. Some standouts were the potato salad and the sesame noodle salad. As for the sweet side, there are 10 types of bundt cake, from Earl Grey with blueberries to almond ginger to several kinds of chocolate cake, and 2 kinds of pie.  On top of that, I enjoyed my Tofishy--which was fried and breaded tofu on a bun with lettuce and tomato, and vegan cocktail sauce (vegan tartar sauce was the other option). Oh, cocktail sauce. I haven't had you in a long time, as you often contain Worcestershire sauce, and because I didn't know what else you could go with besides seafood. I didn't realize how much I missed you.   Even folks less keen on tofu will be happy here--there are always more standard brunch entree options like pancakes, French toast and eggs. While I did visit on a big graduation weekend, which might skew the clientele a little bit, I feel like the mix of young, middle-aged and elderly people eating here shows that everyone will find yummy bliss at Zenith's Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"So after reading all the 5 star reviews about Zenith, I had to stop in and see what everyone was raving about. I'll skip the part about how cool it is, the hipster ambiance, and how the inside is like an A.D.D. person's wet dream. That's already been hammered to death in all of the other reviews on this site. I should also state up front that I am a carnivore, Yes, that's right, I like to eat dead animals. But I knew the Zenith caters to the vegan nitch when I went in and I was all good with that. Lastly, I should mention that I noticed that most of the rave reviews on here are for the brunch menu. I came here around 5:00 pm and ordered from the dinner menu.   The guy that greeted me had a friendly demeanor, invited me to choose a table and he handed me a menu. I chose the Curry Chick Pea Burrito mainly because it boasted \"curry spices\" and I have a palate for spicy foods. It didn't take long for my burrito to come and it was piping hot when it arrived. I cut it in half and took a bite and it was just there. I was hoping for the flavor to jump out but it was just a bland burrito. I asked for some Sriracha sauce which gave it some kick but I thought the curry should have done that.   If you're a die-hard vegan I suppose this is the place for you. But if you're looking for a burrito, check out one of the many Mexican restaurants in the South Side that use beef."}
{"text":"Ok. I have now been to Zenith, NOT for shopping, but for their delicious food!  There evening dinners are a feast of cheap and plentiful vegan and vegetarian cuisine. And then there is the Sunday brunch... For 10 bucks you get coffee, an all-you-can-eat buffet of every type of salad, noodles, cakes, and pies imaginable... PLUS a brunch entree! Get there early or you will have to wait.  The atmosphere is super casual, the food is homemade, and it is the perfect spot to catch-up with friends."}
{"text":"VEGETARIAN BRUNCH.  Top three things to love about Zenith: 1. Out of this world decor 2. Elaborate veggie dishes 3. $11.50  I realize to the average bear that might not get you going, but breakfast has a lot of fatty meats in it (sausage, bacon, grits, whathaveyou) and it makes brunch a lot less fun when you don't partake in those items.   Easily a vegetarian brunch could just mean a Comfort Inn Continental Breakfast. This is not the case. The buffet is made of couscous, broccoli salad, vegan cakes... Really 75% of what's going on those tables are raw and clean foods. Super healthy.   I ordered veggie burger. Admittedly I was recovering from a doosie of an evening that my friend group called \"Galentine's Day.\" At any rate, this was just what the doctor ordered. And all those veggies replenished my vitamin supply.   It's regularly an antique shop from what I gather. It's very over-the-top, dancing on the line of creepy. Millions of angels, a few mannequins, and an oddly placed Santa doll later and you've got the Zenith deco scheme. I dig it.   It's a hidden gem just off of Carson Street and one worth making a trip to uncover.   P.S. The coffee wasn't amazing, but Big Dog Coffeeshop is just a hop and a slip away to complete your Sunday morning checklist."}
{"text":"As someone skeptical of Vegan food, this place more than exceeded my expectations. Between the variety of foods on the menu and side dish bar, I left full and satisfied. Highly recommend that you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday with a friend to enjoy the Sunday Brunch, which is an absolute bargain at $10. It is not a secret judging by the line of people queuing up.  Had the pleasure of waiting 20 minutes or so to be seated, which was NO problem, because there is just so damn much stuff to look at: vintage jewelry, shoes, clothing, glassware, furniture, bad art, good art, lamps (sooo many!) you get the idea.  When you put your name in, they will ask if you mind sitting with other people. I love love love this idea! We met a couple who were perfect dining companions.   The meal consisted of a  dozen or so vegan salads, side dishes and desserts set out in a traditional buffet, plus a hot entree of choice cooked to order. For ten bucks!    I should pay better attention to official menu descriptions of dishes. We sampled a few of the cold items on the buffet--all delicious. I thought the green bean salad was fantastic. We shared these two hot entrees: a chick pea, potato and green bean wrap. Steaming hot when cut open, the potatoes almost the consistency of mashed (or smashed), wee bit of a ginger scent. It was comfort food at its finest. The other item was a small casserole dish filled with chick peas, yams, red beans (NOT canned!) pineapple, kale with a jerk seasoning lightly mixed in.   Skipped the desserts (AGAIN!), but I could see a large sideboard covered with layer cakes of many sorts....sigh...  Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We're new to Pittsburgh and we were so delighted to find this hidden treasure. It's definitely quirky and not for uppity personalities. I'll be purchasing items from their store soon to decorate our new place. We love eating here and shopping!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had my doubts walking in, but it turned out great.  Came for a late lunch or early dinner, around 4ish, so we were the only people in the shop. It's an antique shop, with a dine-in option. Though we didn't see people come in for dinner when we were leaving around 6ish, there were a couple of takeout orders.  Had a wonderful dinner - ordered a variety of stuff, including soup, salads, and appetizers. Everything was super delicious!   Afterward, we shopped around a bit and got some pretty cool things. I got a pair of retro Nikes for $20!   An archaic, vintage shop with vegetarian dining. So bizarre but wonderful.  Note, staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the zenith for the Sunday brunch, very excited to find a new place to eat for vegetarians.. the buffet was good but the entrees we ordered were sweet ! We ordered the stuffed cabbage and a wrap ! The desserts were okay !"}
{"text":"Just moved to Pittsburgh, and a friend told me about the brunch buffet here. It's one of the best dining experiences I've ever had, and I'm not even vegetarian. Get there before it opens to avoid the line!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch: unpleasant if crowded. You may have to share a table with strangers as they do in Asia. Can be awkward if you want to have a conversation with a friend or if they are hipsters. Nice variety for buffet though. Limited tea menu.  Saturday lunch: Full tea menu. Better table choice. Nice lighting if you can sit in the inside room. Bring a camera and take some no-flash pictures. The colors are quite warm."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for The Zenith. I finally made it here for Sunday brunch: * I arrived ten minutes before opening and there was already a group waiting in line which continued to build until they let us in. Looking back it was not necessary for us to do that as there seemed to be always a few opened tables. However my friend and I were seated at a table just for us versus the communal seating. * I choose my entree as the coconut pancakes. The coconut was not overpowering which was great though the baking soda that was used could be tasted so not so great. The curry side was a weird pairing and it was okay though The Zenith could have just served me my pancakes (and mixed the batter more to nix the baking soda taste). * The desserts were good. The salads - smattering of fruit, leafy greens, pasta/grains - were hit or miss for me. The peanut noodles as recommended by other Yelpers were a hit. * Service was slow and our waitress did not give us coffee refills upon our request towards the end of our meal. She also could not be found when it came to paying our check so we had to ask the other waiters to track her down.  Overall I'm glad I came to The Zenith. It is a cool unique venue and am glad it caters to the vegan/vegetarian crowd. The price is right for all that you get and I definitely left full (and not the greasy full) but I'm on the fence as to whether I would come back."}
{"text":"Yinz I will miss this place. I have eaten so many Sunday brunches here its kind of ridiculous- I went to a lovely bridal shower hosted here on a Saturday (they do private parties too)- and also happy food times were had. Two words: PIE TABLE. Thats right your $10 brunch buys you an entree, coffee, a buffet of side dishes and a buffet of cake/pie. I'm shedding tears right now about how $10 will buy me two cups of coffee in NYC"}
{"text":"I was so glad I was finally able to visit this place. It is an antique store and restaurant combined. Each table is uniquely dressed and can accommodate a small group. Their menu changes weekly and I was pleased that they had a lunch menu. They also will hold events here such as a bridal shower or anniversary. Just contact the business for more information.  Staff was very pleasant and explained everything to me. Their food is basically vegan but hey, it's all good! I chose for my lunch a platter that consisted of two lentil patties, curried potatoes, and apple chutney. This platter also comes with your choice of salad or soup. Today's soup was vegan chili.  It too a bit of time to get the food but it was well worth it. My chili which I was expecting a cup was a whole bowlful! I saw people at a nearby table order a salad as their side and believe me it looked like a meal in itself.  Afterwards I got the main course. Those lentil patties were so filling and so good that I could only eat one of them.  The chutney and the potatoes also were awesome!  I saw they had brought out a cake earlier which was a vegan lemon cake. When I was done my waitress asked if I wanted a slice of it. Regrettably I had to turn it down since I was so full but it looked delicious! She told me the cuts on the cake were also generous.  This place really gives you a lot of bang for your buck when I realized my meal with water was only $9.00 plus tax. I only wish they were open more  days of the week but to make up for that you get free two hour parking on Sarah St where the entrance is.  This shop has so much in it that you can take hours looking around. Everything is for sale but I was just glad to finally have the opportunity to dine here. Zenith is located near the Southside shoppes. Although the address lists 26th St the entrance is on Sarah St."}
{"text":"I went to Zenith because of the great reviews, and even with high hopes going in, Zenith surpassed my expectations! The food was delicious! My spouse and I shared black bean and tomato soup, a seitan steak wrap, and vegan lasagna. The menu changes weekly, is all vegan, with the option of substituting with cheese for some of the dishes. Great portions at an affordable cost. The service was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is magical. The cafe is attached to an antique shop with a fun selection of clothes, jewelry, artwork, and much more! Highly recommend a visit here and I will definitely be back when I'm next in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is the best place only to have a relaxed Sunday brunch in Pittsburgh. If you can locate this place in Southside it takes even more searching to find someone to seat you in the backside if the antique store.  The wait is worth it even for non-vegetarians as they choose from a range of entrees that keep changing every week. Additionally feel free to help yourself to numerous salads, rice and noodle dishes with bread and dips on buffet. The dessert options are pretty good if you have room left in your stomach. Their spl teas are good and deserve refills. All this for $10 leaves you with lot more to spend on the rest of your Sunday."}
{"text":"Cool weirdo hangout brunch. Enjoyed the decor and atmosphere. Food was pretty good. Had the lentil burger and the vegan French toast. Limited drink options. Kids didn't care for the food, though it was a half portion and half price for children, which was cool. 6/10 would visit a second time."}
{"text":"What are the 5 Stars for: food, service, hospitality, originality?  Not all of these but 3 or 4 with a caveat: you don't go to an antiques shop for food, let alone vegan/vegetarian AND buffet (on Sundays).  Let's not forget the vegan bundt cakes either.  I give Zenith some slack for service in that patrons shouldn't go there with Michelin-service expectations but for Elaine and crew to stick out their necks in Pgh and do wonderful and very affordable vegan... I don't have a problem rounding up to 5 Stars.  Return visits are in the making!"}
{"text":"Veggie food AND antiques together in the same place!   This place is just downright fun. There is plenty of stuff to look at while you wait for a table and even while you're eating, as every square inch of this place is filled to capacity with art and interesting objects hanging from the walls and ceiling.  I'm withholding one star because even though the food is satisfying, a lot of it is food you could probably make yourself.  But when I don't feel like cooking, this is where I go, and it's a great place to bring out of town guests.  The brunch is massive and packed."}
{"text":"I took my vegetarian friend to The Zenith when she came to visit after a suggestion from another vegetarian friend. THIS IS A GREAT DEAL. I thought I was reading the website/menu wrong when I saw that you get an entree, drink and a sides and dessert buffet all for about $12-13.   The charm of this place is the environment. It is in the back of a antique store and basically looks like a huge dining room. Guests will fill up large tables, which affords you the opportunity to meet different people and have chats (if you want). The decorations are very eclectic, with each corner/section having a theme (e.g. Christmas). You order an entree (full on breakfast, lunch and brunch options are on the menu) and you can also get unlimited servings of delicious sides like hummus, pasta salads, etc. There is also a huge table of desserts.   The Zenith is unlike any other eatery I have been to - which is pretty cool. Plus, it was approved by my picky vegetarian friend :)"}
{"text":"I was in town for a friend's wedding and was looking for a good brunch place that would be vegan/vegetarian friendly (for me) and also have gluten-free options (for a friend). My local friend said she had tried Zenith for lunch and that it was awesome! She also said that the brunch was supposed to be even better so the three of us decided to go for Sunday brunch.  What a funky, cool spot! The thrift shop upfront provided more than an eyeful as we grabbed our coffees and waited for a table. We were quickly seated and handed menus. I ordered the barbecue seitan sandwich and both my friends got the roasted portabella plate with mashed sweet potatoes and greens.  Then it was on to the table groaning with all kinds of salads: fruit salads, grain salads, pasta salads, vegetable salads, etc. Wow, what a spread! I chose about five different kinds to try out and returned to my seat. Our main courses quickly joined our overloaded table. Upon taking a bite of my seitan sandwich, I immediately noticed how sweet it was. It had some spice to it, but the overwhelming flavor was sweetness. My friends took bites of their dishes and said the same thing. We then all tried our various salads. Good, but again, too sweet! What was going on here? Did whoever prepared the food have a serious sweet tooth? At least the cakes were good and sweet, as expected.  The food was okay but not nearly as good as I was hoping for. My local friend said lunch was much better and was also confused as to why it was so different this time. Hopefully it was a one-time thing and the food is normally seasoned better. If not, stay away unless you love your sugar."}
{"text":"Seriously, one of thee most unique places to eat in the Burgh!  Big thing here is, it's an antique shop that also has awesome vegetarian food!  So being a antique shop, they draw upon that for all their decorations in the dining room area.  It's like walking into your quirky grandma or aunt's house.   The food could stand alone, without the antiques shop.  I ordered the lentil burger for the first time ever.  I can happily report back that it was absolutely delish!  It was HUGE and packed full of goodies (what I found out was, lentils, bread crumbs, potatoes, etc.).  The burger kinda fell apart after a few bites so I opted to eat with a fork.  No worries, it still tasted good!  It also came with a side of chips, but I opted out because of my lame diet and ended up getting a side salad.  The side salad acted more like a full salad, it was served in a tiny bowl stuffed full of fresh lettuce, peppers and grapes!    Since I'm a huge fan of tea I was also super excited to see such a massive tea list.  I choose the Almond Spice black tea and am happy to report it was super tasty.  Loved that it came out in a pot all for myself!  I love my own personal tea parties!  The antique side is, of course, filled with a plethora of chachkies.  But there's many many treasures to be found!  I totally dug a couple of awesome 70's style dresses that inspire me to find some kind of 70's themed party (or throw one!).  I thought the vintage costume jewelry selection was awesome though!  It was a win win for me walking out of there with a full belly and a $12 vintage bracelet!    Don't be fooled, this place is legit awesomeness!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian by any means, but I'm pretty open minded on vegetarian and vegan food and have cooked quite a few dishes.  I have always had heard good things about The Zenith, but never had an opportunity to go.  Today I went, and it was everything that I thought it would be.  I went to the Sunday brunch and ordered the tofu and walnut meatball sandwich.  The buffet and coffee/tree comes with any entree you order.  The buffet hands down the best part of the experience.  They had really unique yet simple salad and pasta dishes.  The pickled cucumber/red onions and the noodles with peanut sauce were my favorite dishes from the buffet.  The tofu and walnut meatball sandwich was pretty good, but ate all of it except the bread because I was already half full by the time the sandwich came to our table.    The only downside is that you're not able to take your main entree home.  So I had to leave quite a few things on the plate unfortunately.  I can understand not taking buffet food home, but we should be allowed to take our main entree home if we can't finish.  Besides that downside overall the place is fantastic and can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"OMG Terrible even my wife likes vegetarian and hated this  Quick give me a real egg and meat!! Even sub par for veggie lovers  The first experience with a yelp recommendation I was totally turned off by"}
{"text":"This is one of Pittsburgh's hidden gems. It is tucked away in the Southside and most people probably walk right by not knowing it is a restaurant. We went here based on a recommendation and I was glad I knew that I should walk to the back of the shop and around the corner to get to the restaurant. Otherwise, I may have though I was in the wrong place.  There is usually only one person working there during the day (probably not the case for brunch), so be prepared to wait a while, although you may not have to. If you have to, definitely walk around and check out the antiques. I believe everything (even the table you are sitting at while you eat) is for sale.  The food is fantastic. I have tried a number of different items on the menu, and have been blown away every time. They seem to switch their menu up often enough, and I have heard great things about their brunch. I will be back soon to try it!"}
{"text":"Zenith's all about the atmosphere.  You're in an antique shop, it's so cool!  The food's pretty good; not super spectacular but definitely worth it for the price.  You get an entree, the buffet bar, and the choice of a hot or iced tea.  I had their scrambled eggs my first time, which didn't wow me at all, and the Moroccan Stew this morning, which was definitely good.  The best part is definitely the buffet bar and the assortment of cakes; I REALLY like their different pastas.  You gotta get to Zenith early.  I've been to Zenith twice; once I got there just after 10 AM to wait in line for when they open at 11 AM while today I got there after 12 PM.  If you get there early, you'll get better service from the waiters since they won't be as overwhelmed in the beginning.  The food at the buffet bar will be fresher since all the food is made once and when it's out it's out.  Get there too late and all the best foods are gone (I missed out on their stuffed grape leaves and green beans today).  Also, if you get there early you'll get your own table, but if you get there later you might have to share a table with other patrons.  Today we ended up sitting at a table with three other parties, which is kinda cool but also kinda awkward at the same time.  I think Zenith's the kinda place that not everyone will be able to appreciate, but for those who do, they absolutely love it."}
{"text":"Carnivore here who tried it out. Went for brunch and was impressed with the buffet beyond words. Couple kinds of salads, couple kinds of veggies, couple kinds of pasta salads, orzo salad, and some suprisingly tasty vegan desserts. I had the black bean burger and have to say it's been the BEST alternative burger I've ever had in the city. Place was cool to look over and lots to keep you talking . I would tell anyone who asked me what the best vegan brunch in the city was at the Zenith. Super spot."}
{"text":"Vegan thrift store that should just be called Cake Breakfast. I love how healthy and hip this place makes me feel when I am sporting a pernicious hangover and a belly just emptied of last night's pizza."}
