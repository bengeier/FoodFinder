{"text":"Very nice spot, authentic food. We all had pho (house special) and it was very tasty, would definitely come back for more.   Highly recommend, clean building too"}
{"text":"I give credit this place is amazing food is fresh and price are ridiculous cheap"}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to! I enjoyed everything I ate there. The service was excellent too!"}
{"text":"OMGosh, I went there Sept 7th because it's close to home. A pot of tea was placed on the table upon my arrival.  You write on the order sheet what you want.    I had the fresh shrimp wrap appetizer, and it came with THE best peanut sauce I ever had (ie, the only one I've ever had, lol).  Then, for my main course, I had # 134 \"grilled pork with spring roll\".  I was in heaven.  The food was amazing !   The size of the bowl was huge, and I couldn't finish it all.  I will definitely go here again.   I've seen a few other pho places local to home, I haven't been yet, but I've been to other pho restaurants in Orangeville, and Ottawa; and this place is by far THE BEST I'VE BEEN TO."}
{"text":"Stopped by based on the previous reviews. First thing that hits you as soon as you walk in is the wonderful aromas of the spices they use in the broth. Ordered the 109 and husband ordered the 110. Broth was amazing and the noodles was tender and not too thick. Service was quick. Took off one star cuz it could have had more meat in the pho."}
{"text":"I will never go to Pho Vaughan again. I went here with two other people and sat down at a table. After sitting there for ten minutes, no menu or tea was brought over, and no one came over to take our order, we left. I saw two ladies look over at us and they just continued to talk amongst themselves. Horrible place. Go to Ox Noodle instead."}
{"text":"As usual, one of my coworkers is a foodie, and he told me that we should try out this Pho place, besides the usual Pho Anise. This place is located in the plaza that is adjacent to the car dealerships on Jane St, north of Rutherford. If you are going south on Jane, you'd have to make a left into the plaza entrance (same entrance to Zona's), and then make a quick left/U Turn and you'll see the place.  Upon entering, we sat down and looked at the menu. The ambiance, and overall hygiene, I'd rate it out of a 7.5/10. The menus could use some overhaul in terms of their layout and appearance.   I noticed that they only had one vegetarian dish, which actually its just plain noodle soup. To add mixed vegetables, its another $3.45 if I am not mistaken. As far as I know, most Pho places I've been to, already have the vegetables and don't charge you for it. Any how, I didn't want to seem picky, so I opted for that.  I was not asked if I wanted the broth to be vegetable based. I am quiet sure it is either fish or chicken based, but I myself had to ask. At least Pho Anise informed me or had asked me in the past, where and if I want the vegetable broth.   Any how, that being aside, the server told me that there's no vegetable broth, and they'll use water instead. That was no fun at all. It was tasteless and lets just say that I wasn't satisfied. Even adding the hot sauce to the soup, did nothing at all. There's not much to say about the vegetables. Vegetables are vegetables, and at least they were cooked properly, and not raw.   I guess I won't be coming back to this place after all, and would continue going to Pho Anise for my pho."}
{"text":"Not bad and the price is decent.  The menu is minimal and the hours of operation kind of sucks.  What restaurant closes at 8pm on a Sunday.  The food is very fresh!! I love seeing fresh lime, mint leaves and sprouts. The broth is clear and tasty and not overally salty....not much msg if at all.   It is one of the better north of Rutherford."}
{"text":"We ordered spring rolls and pho with ice soya milk and ice coffee with condensed milk. The spring roll sucks like it's a frozen spring roll you buy at the grocery store and you just deep fried it. The pho was pretty good with a perfect amount of noodle and meat. The ice soya milk is just complete disappointment. They felt powdery that you are positive that they just make this from whatever package and just add some water and ice in it. The ice coffee was good though. I would totally recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Pho. I used to drive all the way downtown on Spadina for a decent bowl of pho. I now find the Pho in Vaughan so much better. The establishment is clean, soup broth is not too greasy. I like their noodles too. They don't use the flat thick rice noodles. They use thin rice noodles. ( that's a personal preference).  I mostly order beef tendon, beef brisket noodle soup. I like to load tons of basil in it and one squirt of lime. Delish! Of course I always finish my meal with an avocado milk shake."}
{"text":"The best Bun Cha Ca Hanoi I've had in Toronto! Almost as good in Vietnam :)"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to. Weordered 127 Fish cake and grilled pork nugget in betel leaf, 106 Grilled pork sausage rolls, 109 special beef noodle soup, and 131 Hanoi styled grilled pork for a family of 4. (or 2 and a half people considering 2 of them were 5 and under and we would be lucky if they could eat half a dish) The total was around $46 after tax and tip.  The food had great flavour and they were probably the best I've ever had from a Vietnamese restaurant. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broths were really tasty. The pork was also seasoned to perfection. Since they specialize in Northern Vietnamese cuisine they had items on the menu that I've never found in any other Vietnamese restaurant.   The place was very nice and quiet and had a good homey vibe to it. I don't think the waitress knew English because she just politely smiled and never uttered a word. The service was pretty decent though. We got our orders pretty fast even though the restaurant was pretty full.  The prices were decent and so were the portion sizes. At the end of the meal we were all full but not extremely full.  Overall, I would definitely come here to eat again."}
{"text":"131 - actually in love with this dish.   Mistakenly ordered 125 thinking it was THE bun cha we wanted. Got this noodle in tomato soup-looking dish. Tasted horrible. I saw others eating this and I am sorry, but I could not understand... how?!  After getting the wrong dish, we ordered what we came for. Number 131, under the section with a bolded word BUN KHA. Uploaded photo of the menu for your reference - you're welcome.   The dipping sauce/soup is vinegary and you get a heaping amount of noodle that you dip into the sauce. Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"food is authentic and delicious, and the place is very clean. the lady is very friendly with order recommendations."}
{"text":"Not everything here is amazing but if you know what to get its awesome. My three favourites are the pork sausage roll (106), bun cha ca, and the super special giant spring rolls for $16 (but worth it!)"}
{"text":"Haven't reviewed anywhere in Vaughan in awhile so this is perfect spots to get back into it with. We were on the hunt for fresh Pho on Saturday and after a quick scan of the limited reviews in Vaughan we decided that Pho Vaughan had the most reviews and highest rating and  set the GPS for it.  It's located in the strip mall/condo combo plaza across from Canada's Wonderland and parking is 1 row so at peak hours it is TIGHT. There is no turn around at the end of the row in either direction so if you don't find parking you're forced to do a 3 point turn to go back in the other direction. This isn't a strike against Pho Vaughan, just one for the plaza and a heads up to folks who might visit.  As soon as I entered, I knew the reviews had led us in the right direction. Time at Yelp has taught me that if you go for ethnic food and see more people not of that ethnicity than of it, you should beware. If you see lots of people of that ethnicity of close to it, you can trust it. This spot was right one the money.  Like most Pho, the prices were cheap ($8.50 for a LARGE) and the service was quiet but efficient and quick. The difference was the broth, very very clean, with no lasting effects of other places where it's rife with things like MSG (you can always tell because 1-3 hours later your fingers swell and you get the driest cotton mouth you've ever had.  I had the 116 combo (might not be the exact number) but it had rare beef, braised brisket and beef balls - loved it. For two of us to have the same, both large and tea came out tax and tip to $22. Where are you going to eat for that cheap these days. No where!  Definitely a solid Pho spot in Vaughan - I'll be back!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"my favourite place for pho very tasty broth ive tried alot.of other place but this place jus tasted better"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite go to place for pho in vaughan. Right across from wonderland and located conveniently. This place has a small interior but the broth is wicked! Although I'm not a big fan of the rice and meat dishes, I find the meat is a little bit thin and dry. However, a great place to go for a quick bite! The soup is very authentic and I just can't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"As others have said, it's right next to Wonderland.  The broth was clear and fat free, portions were quite large.  I ordered a large, shared some with a 4yr old and still had enough left to fill me up.  Our table of 5 all agreed, it was delicious. It will be our default place to dine after a long day at Wonderland. The place is also quite clean. Unlike other established pho places.   I have no reason not to give it a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food, authentic dishes with a northern touch of flavour. Unique northern dishes are also available only here. Restaurant is clean and service is quick."}
{"text":"Instinct tells me that this is a pretty good Vietnamese restaurant after having been here regularly.  #26 Bun Cha(Hanoi Pork, $7.50) seems to look pretty authentic from what I can research online.  It had 2 Pork Patties and the rest was Pork Fillets grilled and put into Nuoc Cham.  On Weekends they have that Weekend Special written in Vietnamese for all those Vietnamese patrons that I only notice here and barely any other ethnicities.    From the words from the regular menu, I compiled it to be Duck Pho(#23 Bun Mang Vit) from Duck stock which took some time to arrive but nice to try something outside of the box of what we Canadians seem to think is a limited variety of Vietnamese choices.  *Duck and Bamboo Vermicelli Noodle Soup*  Pho Vaughan is now officially upgraded to 4 *Star* Sorry Gentlemen, I believe both the waitresses are already taken."}
{"text":"This is the most Vietnamese place so far in Toronto when they served us the refreshing cold tea just like in Vietnam.  Price is OK,  avarge.  The soup was good.  The sugar cane drink is the best thing I had so far in Toronto. It was Very Vietnamese that I can't find any place like that even though it costs 4.25 for a drink ( no regret). So far,  the place was awesome.  However,  the reason I gave 4 stars because my boyfriend and I asked for rare beef pho. The beef was too cooked."}
{"text":"Pho Vaughn seems to be quite popular with a variety of clientele.  During peak periods, it is packed full with loyal clientel.  A small joint on the east side of Jane Street in a plaza north of Rutherford and opposite the auto sales showrooms.  A family establishment that has been around for long enough that the tabletop Formica is worn to a ultra smooth surface.  Love that they will serve a pot of tea with the meal, while many places have gone away from that and only do so when you order it.  The broth varies in depth but is usually delicious enough without needing to add modifying condiments.  Bean sprouts are crust as they should as is the basil.  Appreciate that they will serve some Thai Red collies along with the crisp veggies.  Noodle texture is also consistently good, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"The man of the GTA, Kris U was craving pho so he suggested this place for a brief lunch. Boy, oh boyyyy, I am SO glad he did and introduced me to such a gem. He had warned me about the parking so I showed up with plenty of time to spare just in case I had to fight a person for a spot. Or three. Who knows? Luckily, spots were plentiful but I do suggest you back in for an easier exit - you never know when somebody dumb is going to come speeding down the narrow lane.   The menu was cheap!! Which a poor girl is definitely a fan of. I approve. They had a lot of different options but also had a plain pho which I could add veggies to for $3 (which was the only pricey part for some bok choy and a few other assorted vegetables). I had a medium and it came piping hot with a stack of veggies on top. The noodles were average but everything tasted amazing together. I'm not even a big fan of bok choy, but I did enjoy it with the fuuuuh. I also told Kris that he HAD to try to avocado milkshake as it is definitely a staple in any pho meal and he has never had it anywhere. (I know right?! I'm shocked too) I recall him saying it was pretty good and definitely filling.   The place is pretty small but service is stellar. She apologized profusely for taking half our tables to seat another customer even though most just do it anyway. The place definitely gets filled up quickly during lunch hour though, and I can see why!  I'll definitely drop by here when in the area; I don't mind eating pho alone and for such a good price, why not??"}
{"text":"Fairly standard Pho place with clean interior. West facing corner store in a strip plaza with lots of sunlight in the afternoon. Two tables filled when I was there around 2:30pm on a Thursday.  Sat down, ordered a special beef noodle soup which arrived speedily in minutes! Good chewy pho noodles in a hot soup with good flavour. Fair place to have a quick bowl of Pho for lunch break. =]"}
{"text":"Just across from Wonderland this is a nice spot with excellent food. Had the rare beef pho and really enjoyed it. They are very generous with their portions. I can't eat noodles and they were very accommodating giving me extra bean sprouts at request.  Staff are friendly and ask after you've ordered if they are unsure about your order. Which is nice, I'd rather them ask than wing it.   It is on the smaller side it can hold a max of about 40 people. But at the speed they are cranking the food out you're good.   Will return!"}
{"text":"Had special pho.  Very salty broth,  not much tripe and almost no tendon.   Gave us a lot of bean sprouts and basil though.   Overall not a bad pho but there are definitely better out there.   My daughter had a beef dish and the meat was like rubber."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  I don't feel like it's the best pho I've ever had, but I'm currently just getting acquainted with what food is available in Vaughn.    I had pho with rare beef, tripe and brisket, and well priced at $6 + tax and tip.  It's clean enough, and wasn't super busy when I stopped in.  I think I just missed the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I came here for Bun Bo Hue, which was not on their menu (for a reason, I guess), but they made it for me anyways.  I think the girl charged me $12 + tax for it?  It looked spicy but tasted bland. It didn't have the normal toppings that Bun Bo Hue had. It felt like they fried up a tiny piece of lemongrass, put some hot pepper in it, and dumped it in their regular pho broth, and added some random ham and super dry and tough beef slices to it. Did it even have pork blood curds? I don't remember, it was such an unimpressive bowl.  It was just disappointing overall. I wish I had gone to my normal spot after taking a couple of sips of the soup. I had to add so much extra sauce to it to finish it.  No wonder this place was empty."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, it was my favourite place in literally, the world, for their bun cha Hanoi. I finally brought my mom here to dine after shopping at Vaughan Mills and my... oh my their bathroom is sooooo dirty.   There was a dead fruit fly in my noodle... And more flies buzzing around us."}
{"text":"This short and spicy review is for the Bun Bo Hue only,  I am on a quest to find good Bun Bo Hue (BBH), that is a more spicy pho.  The broth of a BBH has to be a star or the BBH is nothing.  Many places dumb down the broth, so it is hard to find a good BBH. The BBH broth at Pho Vaughan was quite spicy, probably the second most spicy BBH broth I have ever had in GTA.  Yet the beef flavour came through. The noodle was fresh and well portioned.  The quantity of the protein was okay."}
{"text":"This is a pretty dayum good Vietnamese restaurant. It is very authentic and has a variety of specialities some other Vietnamese restaurants don't have such as the Bun Cha Hanoi, Mi Xiao du Bien and many others. I've been here on numerous occasions and for price consistency, most of the dishes are under $10  and will surely get you filled. Great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Tried their seafood rice noodle soup. Lots of veggies, plenty of noodle and just enough of seafood. Loved fresh basil in the soup . Money worth."}
{"text":"This is one of the better options in the area for pho. Place is small by suburban standards and seating is somewhat limited, but manageable. Its proximity to a high school nearby may be why you get the teenage lunch crowd from time to time.  I like the pho here, it's the only item I've ever ordered. I am told that this is northern-style Vietnamese cuisine. I don't know what that means exactly, but one interesting difference is that they add ginger to their pho. Their broth I've found to be generally more intense, full-bodied, not exactly the light type. It's really quite flavourful and this is where the pho shines in my opinion."}
{"text":"Was recommended by my friend to come and have a particular dish that she had in Hanoi, Vietnam. This dish is called Hanoi Grilled Pork (bun cha hanoi). I ordered that dish along with a classic bowl of special pho to try out their soup base. For the appetizer I ordered the fried spring rolls. The spring rolls were not the best but still good. I enjoy my spring rolls with the mummy like wrapper. This tasted similar to a Chinese spring roll. However, the Hanoi grilled pork was delicious! You wrap the meat with the noodles & herbs in a piece of lettuce. Eventually I mixed everything in the bowl of meat and ate it! My hunger got the best of me... The special pho was also delicious! I really enjoy pho places where the soup base isn't heavily based on MSG where I'm dying from thirst afterwards. The soup base did not leave me with the urge to quench my thirst! It was full of flavour! I drank around 98% of the soup! That's how good it was!   If you are in the Vaughan area, I would highly recommend checking this place out! Even though there are plenty of Vietnamese joints right across from Vaughan Mills!"}
{"text":"How have I not seen this place before? Definitely my new fav pho place in Vaughan. Also, it's a good sign when you see a lot of older Vietnamese people eating there to show it's actually authentic. The menu selection shows the authenticity as well as it's very similar to what you'd see in Vietnam. I'll definitely be back! :-)"}
{"text":"We always come here for one thing only... the bun Cha ca. It is the best I've ever tried and I come here strictly for that. A lot of people seem to get their ha noi bun which I will try next time. I don't really like their orange juice as they put sugar in it. I've had the pho and it wasn't a favourite."}
{"text":"Right across the street from Canadas wonderland which s super convenient as Wonderlands food is insanely expensive. I had the plain beef pho and was tasty i always add chilli paste and siriracha  sauce. The flavour of the pho broth on its own was good. The medium soup is really filling and for $7.50 you can't go wrong.   The place is pretty small and they only have a few tables, the menu has a lot of options and the food came out quickly. I'll be back her when I'm at wonderland for sure. It's a good cheap meal thats close to wonderland.   I personally prefer Ramen over Pho but since I dont know of any ramen places this area this is where I will be coming back. Just be forewarned they only take cash and debit."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to places for Pho or Vietnamese food in general now.  Luckily I'm in the Vaughan area more often because if not, I would have never discovered this place.  There are some dishes here that you won't find at your typical Pho restaurant and that's what makes this place stand out to me.  Some notable dishes here are the Bun Bo Hue, Bun Cha Hanoi and Bun Cha Ca.  Of course, the staple dish, Pho, always a good dish to go back to when not exploring other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Noodle soup in these hot days say what???  I can't help it and trust me, Vietnamese noodle soup doesn't always mean Pho. Pho is our national dish, but we have more than just that. Have you ever tried those noodle soup from the middle of Vietnam, originally from the South, or from the North? Pho Vaughan offers a variety of Northern-style Vietnamese cuisines. And they have this sour noodle soup (that I like) that can refresh yourself and help you cleanse the system with all those herbs and vegetables.  I always here for their Vietnamese fish cake, fried fish and fried pork in betel leaves noodle soup. Yum!!! Also, I always order shredded pork skin salad rolls, with fish sauce on the side.   The broth is clear, tasty and sour enough for someone who dislike sour food like me. It  isn't as sour as Thai tomyum and it's not spicy. The soup comes with lots of thin pieces of fish cakes in the soup, vegetables, fried fish and 2 pieces of pork in betel leaves on the side (my favourite). The portion size are huge!   Why do I love shredded pork skin salad rolls here? Because they make it almost close to those I had back home. Their salary rolls are big, however their fish sauce isn't tasty enough. I think they adjust the sauce so everyone can have it. (You know how strong the fish sauce can smell). (And Karla, stop thinking for yourself:P)  They make the food from North of Vietnam the right way. From the Pho, salad rolls (northern types), and those sour noodle soup.   The restaurant is small, but clean and neat. You won't feel suffocated in here and the smell of food makes you feel even hungrier.   The staffs here are nice and very friendly. They are quick as well. As soon as you sit down, there will be pot of tea right on the table for you. And you can ask them for iced water if you don't want the hot tea.   Like I said, the portion size is pretty decent so price here is reasonable.  You may bump into me here, who knows? :)"}
{"text":"Not bad prices.  They can be a little salty at times but it's one of the better pho restaurants in Vaughan. I'd come back"}
{"text":"We were in the area getting our hair cuts and was told by our hair dresser to come here for authentic north Vietnamese food like bun cha ga. Ever since I had bun cha ga in Vancouver, I have been searching for a good northern Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto and the search will continue...  It's not that the bun cha ga wasn't good, it was decent.  Two reason why it was pile compare to the bun cha ga I had in Van.  Firstly, the broth was a bit sour for my taste and secondly, the fish cake/pattie was super thin and there wasn't much in the bowl,  We also order the giant spring roll which came highly recommended. It was definitely something different as one roll was almost the size of my forearm! It takes 15 mins to prepare as it's wrap fresh when the order is placed.  Unlike regular spring rolls which comprise of minced pork, there were actually chunks of pork and shrimp inside along bean sprouts, vermicelli and other veggies.  Also unlike the usual, the wrapper is rice paper so it was extra crunchy."}
{"text":"Location: Convenient, parking at front 5* Authenticity: 5* Specially mid-Region of Viet Nam cac món bún Hue / Trung Service: 5* Cleanliness: 5* Price: a little more pricey compared to others VN restaurants in the area. But hey, the food is great."}
{"text":"2nd time here and hasn't disappointed. Fresh rolls on point. As for Pho, the broth is everything. This one is slightly less salted but the flavour is great. Will come back to try other menu items got sure"}
{"text":"Drove super far from the east end to try this place & came by around 4pm and the place was closed. On a Saturday... I was not happy at all. There was no signs indicating why it was closed when store hours are listed open.   There's no reason for me to call and check if they're suppose to be opened.   This review could possibly change if I ever end up coming back and if the food is 'good'"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a real ma&pa operation.  The Pho is rich, balanced and very tasty.  The chicken fried rice is a hit with the kids.  Strawberry slushy is excellent.  The service is very friendly.  The restaurant is very clean (from the semi-open kitchen to the dining room, to the bath room.)"}
{"text":"This place is one of the better vietnamese restaurants i have had most of them serve the same dishes this one and clean and taste better then most."}
{"text":"Dropped by Pho Vaughan for a late lunch on a weekday.. I was surprised that to find it was not the usual Pho's crowd I usually encountered.   I were sandwiched in between teenagers.. swearing, gossipping while eating their lunch.. more like a high school cafeteria feel.   The Pho I have is A-OK. Though the noodle is dried noodle but it was well cooked. The broth has a good taste of anise and deliciously salty!   Service here is fast and efficient... In and out quickly after I stuffed my face with Pho."}
{"text":"I've had dinner at Pho Vaughan a few times now and the food is excellent. I've ordered both the pho with beef brisket as well as the grilled chicken rice dish. The pho broth is flavorful and just perfect. The pho is definitely filling and makes for a great meal on a cold winter day. I really enjoyed the grilled chicken dish. The chicken was not overcooked and was marinated perfectly. The dipping sauce is definitely authentic and I suggest drizzling it on the rice if you like spice. It goes well with the fried egg. The rice dish also comes with a bowl of broth.  They take cash or debit. However, the debit machine is old school. You can almost imagine the beeping sounds from the 2400 baud modem."}
{"text":"Not bad overall.  Had the special pho. The broth was salty and a bit greasy but had good flavour( my girlfriend's was more fragrant and less salty, I think I got the last bit of a pot). The overall quantity was pretty good. There are only S,M, and Large($9.75) sizes available. There could have been more meat but the cuts were pretty good quality and not fatty. The veggie dish did not have culantro which made me a bit sahd. And the place was missing my fav condiment, pickled peppers. The condensed milk ice coffee came in a plastic cup, tasted good and nice and thick, 3$. Overall 6.5-7/10!"}
