{"text":"The views were amazing, yes. Our server was nice and sweet. But we won't be coming back- it's way over priced for food. Unfortunately, an order of truffle fries is $11. We also had the pork tacos & they were pretty good."}
{"text":"We had a 6:30 reservation and we were seated immediately. Unfortunately we waited a full 10 minutes without water, server or acknowledgement that we were at the table. I had to stop a busboy and ask about a server. 5 minutes after that a server came over and made no apologies that we had now been sitting for 15 minutes at the table. We ordered drinks which took another 15 minutes to arrive. The cocktail was great when it finally did arrive but that was 30 minutes after we sat down. We ordered and didn't receive our first dish for another 30 minutes. We had tickets to a show and let out server know that we were concerned we wouldn't have time to eat. Finally the food showed up all at once and we had 10 minutes to eat or we would miss our show. The food was good but hard to enjoy when you're scarfing it down. Disappointed in the service, pace of this location. The middleton location could definitely give them some pointers."}
{"text":"Holy crap, a wall to wall $H!@ show of humanity and slow service.  Stay away when it's busy."}
{"text":"What fantastic views of Madison from Eno Vino downtown! This bar is an amazing addition to the downtown scene. My husband and I went on a busy Saturday night and despite it being quite busy we were able to find a spot fairly quickly. I highly recommend visiting this hip bar & bistro!"}
{"text":"Excellent views of the Capitol. Pricey. Very Busy. 10th floor enclosed bar. 9th floor open terrace overlooking Washington with great views S,E and W. Food was exceptional."}
{"text":"I'm not usually the type of person who lets bad service ruin a restaurant, but this one is hard to ignore. In our bowl of fries (which were cold to begin with), we found a screw covered in cheese. They comped the fries but didn't seem to make much of an effort to redeem themselves. Great drinks and a great view, though!"}
{"text":"Ladies, take your phone into the Ladies Room - a selfie is in order.  Loved the food, atmosphere and service.  Can't wait to bring my out of town guests to wow them with a beautiful view of Madison."}
{"text":"TL;DR

Beautiful backdrop of the Capitol.

Noise level is loud.

Knowledgeable service, especially with their tapas. Our server was right on with his recommendation of the Pork Tacos (yum!).

Pricey! No drinks, two tapas = $30 w/ tip.

Would make an impressive spot for a date (they have a lower level lounge with a fireplace that's less deafening) , or just a great place to impress your out-of-town friends."}
{"text":"Just turn up the low-key club tracks and remove the tables on the balcony and I'd hang out with those views all day/night. Keep the dining inside with the windows open. We didn't eat here so I can't recommend the food either way."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. Located at the 10th floor of a hotel, the view was outstanding! You could see the Capital on one side and an awesome lake on the other... the food was also amazing ! It is tapas style and everything we ordered we loved: four cheese flatbread(huge and needed some chili flakes for more flavor), crispy lobster - I'm salivating writing about this, it was some of the best bites I'd ever had, and the seared calamari - extremely flavorful and juicy."}
{"text":"Go for drinks and the great view but not for the food. The scallops were tasty but heirloom tomatoes and burrata had little flavor. Skip the underdone bruschetta. It was cold and prosciutto had an unexpected sweet taste. The waitress was nice and didn't charge us for the uneaten appetizer. Nice drink menu with reasonably priced wine."}
{"text":"The downtown location has figured it out. We went here the first week it opened, and it wasn't up to par with the Middleton location but they met and exceeded expectations this evening. The menu was excellent with variation from last time and a couple of fantastic specials for the evening. The service was excellent - our waiter Brian did a great job - confident with recommendations with timely service and led the way facilitating a great overall restaurant experience. Well done eno vino"}
{"text":"Most wouldn't contest that this place has the best restaurant views in the city, but you definitely end up paying a pretty penny for it. 

It's crowded here, so make a reservation if you can. We started out standing on the balcony for a drunk before snagging a table. I ordered a fresh watermelon Moscow Mule; 10/10 would recommend in the summer. 

My partner and I shared the chicken lollipops. I never knew chicken drumsticks could be gourmet  until I went to Eno Vino. To die for. Crisped to perfection, and I didn't even mind the mushrooms as a non-shroom lover. We didn't leave full, and actually ate some food after we left home; this was expected considering it's a tapas menu. 

The buzz this place generated is most definitely warranted. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for a work dinner with coworkers. We picked this place because we knew it would be great for sharing plates. They have an extensive wine list, as expected, which can be a bit overwhelming. However, they have the menu on an iPad on the table so you can more easily break it down.  I had a Red Blend that I really enjoyed.  
As for the plates that we shared, there were 5 of us and we ordered 8 small plates. It was definitely more than enough! We ordered:
-Pork Belly BLT
-Pork Tacos
-Octopus
-Poke Poke
-Brussel Sprouts
-Beet Salad
-Calamari
-Goat Cheese Tortellini
+ the complimentary bread and cilantro/lime butter

Out of the above items, I would eat the pork tacos, calamari and brussel sprouts again in a heart beat. I liked the Poke as well, but wouldn't necessarily order it again. The pork BLT was delicious (cut like butter!), but hard to eat and hard to share. 
I need another excuse to go back here to try more dishes and the creme brulee, which apparently has a layer of brownie in it. Sounds amazing!
Sharing plates and splitting the bill was a good way to go. Get your money worth!"}
{"text":"The food is great probably ( cause I'm still waiting like 20 min) but it takes them forever to make it.   But atmosphere is amazing. Very nice cozy place. So I give them 3 starts.

Updates : food is really good."}
{"text":"Don't know why I didn't stop in sooner, it's bright and loud with excellent views of the Capital area. They have a solid drink menu and small plates. Of all the plates we had the Goat cheese tortellini really stood out! Parking nearby."}
{"text":"We went there this weekend for my bachelorette party. The view was incredible and the place was beautiful! My sister had made the reservation 3 weeks in advance for 14 but when we got there, we were split between two tables. I was quite disappointed because I wanted us all to be together! I asked if we could join them together and they had said no because it would be a fire hazard. The manager came over and talked with me about it. I told him that with 3 weeks advance notice they should have been able to put us at one table. He told me they just couldn't fit a group this large at one table. I looked around surprised as the room was quite large with many tables. They moved our tables together like an L shape but it didn't really help. 

I was complaining about it with my friends when our waiter Brian was pouring our wine. He seriously slammed the bottle on the table, shook his head and walked away. I was in shock and it was so rude of him. I just wanted to be together! 

I've included two photos of the room we were in. You can see there was PLENTY of space for them to move tables together for us but they chose otherwise. Very disappointed in the staff and their customer service."}
{"text":"I don't have one bad word for this place. We came here to celebrate our anniversary and because we heard so much buzz about this place I made sure to make the reservation well in advance. Contrary to belief, there have been times where I've made a reservation and have not been seated right away, but they seemed like they were on top of their jobs and sat us right away. We were greeted with water and menus. We started out with the little decanter of Riesling. We started off with the sweet potato tempura. They were really good but a little on the heavy/greasy side. We also ordered the Seared Scallops and this was by far the best dish of the 4 we ordered. I could eat it every night! The scallops were seared perfectly and it was accompanied by chipotle cream corn, roasted onions and little spanish sausages. This dish was so full of flavor and completely worth every dollar. For our third plate we ordered the filet and oh my goodness, it was so delicate and delicious accompanied by the cutest little goat cheese potato pancakes finished in a beurre rouge sauce. For our last plate, we ordered the bruschetta. This was my least favorite plate, but it wasn't a bad dish to start with, but I suppose with the 2 plates we had in the middle putting me in a flavor heaven, it was an underwhelming send off. Eno Vino is an amazing place for flavorful food. Definetely understand the hype and will certainly be back"}
{"text":"The wine list is the star at this restaurant, and is accompanied by a wonderful view of the capital building. We had multiple glasses of wine by the glass and each was delicious. 

With the gorgeous view and the great wine, we were expecting the food to be on the same level. Unfortunately, for us, this was not the case. The food was good, but did not live up to our expectations. We ordered the following items:

1) Truffled Fries: These were actually quite good. Hot and very crisp. They came with an aioli that was also quite tasty. No complaints on this dish.

2) Bruschetta: For me, the bread on the bruschetta was a bit too soft, and overall I was not that impressed with it. However, my fiancé very much liked all of the bruschetta's that we had. As a result, you'll have to try them for yourself to decide.

3) Grilled Octopus: This is the dish I was looking forward to the most. The octopus had great flavor. Unfortunately, there were only three very small pieces. Portion size normally does not bother me, but what stood out was the amount of roasted potatoes that came with the octopus. There was a significantly large serving of potatoes, and very little octopus. The ratio left me confused, and we ended up leaving the majority of the food (potatoes) on the plate.

4) Seared Scallops: The seared scallops were by far the best dish we had at dinner. The scallops were large, well seasoned, and well cooked. They melted in your mouth but had a slight crust on the outside that still gave it the slightest salty bite. The creamed corn that they sat on was very sweet, but in a good way, and really complemented the scallop. 

If we were to come back to Eno Vino Downtown we would definitely get a couple glasses of wine and probably order the scallops again. However, I would not order the Grilled Octopus or Bruschetta.

If you are looking for a nice glass of wine and a good view, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good.  This place obviously has amazing downtown views.  You have views of the Capitol and the lake; very cool.  This place is going to be packed for a long time because no other restaurant in town has this kind of view.  That's where its draw ends.

The food is pretty mediocre, and that's being generous.  Every single thing tasted like it came out of a Sysco box, pre-prepared with no thought at all put into it.  For example, I'm 99% sure that the \"ceviche\" was pre-cooked shrimp mixed with some tropical fruit and orange juice and the berry tart could have been taken from the frozen food section at T. Joes. Probably the best-tasting thing we had was the pork belly BLT, which is actual pork belly, not pork rinds like another reviewer stated.  They do have pork rinds available to order (chicharrones).  

I get the feeling that whoever created this menu stumbled across a blog post titled, \"How to throw a tapas party on a budget\".  I guarantee you there is no actual \"chef\" in the kitchen whipping up culinary delights.  

Along with the disappointing food, there's the surprisingly amateur staff which are not to the level that you come to expect at a downtown restaurant, especially not one with the prices the Eno Vino charges. 

Overall very disappointing and I probably won't be back until this place turns into something else."}
{"text":"Cool place, a little pricey but that's okay, service hopefully will improve with time. The servers never seem happy.  Love the cheese bored but needs crackers. Happy hour would be nice."}
{"text":"This should be the number one restaurant people need to visit when they come to Madison. 
I had the lobster to start and the steak they were both AMAZING i will definitely visit this place again"}
{"text":"Life doesn't get much better than drinking a glass of wine on their rooftop terrace. Good selection and a classy but relaxed environment. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This food is some of the worst I've had in Madison. It tastes as if everything was frozen and reheated. Lacking texture, freshness and brightness, my two meals here have been both disappointing and expensive. All the cabs by the glass lack depth and for being an Italian restaurant you'd expect a far superior wine program. Service also was inattentive and the place felt dirty."}
{"text":"The view! The ambiance! The food! The cocktails! No disappointments. We made reservations for 6:15pm - Reservations are encouraged and only allowed for indoor seating. We requested a table with a view and they accommodated us! The patio is first come first serve. I was here this evening (Tuesday) and the patio was packed. The service was prompt and our waiter made welcomed recommendations.  We had the truffle fries, the mini pork and black bean tacos, and the combination bruschetta platter - you can choose 4 of the 6. I will definitely be back for a summer patio happy hour sesh!"}
{"text":"Really delicious menu items and the view is terrific. Plenty of choices on the wine side but also great combos on cocktails. Totally recommend watching the sunset while having a meal as the capitol building is front and center. Loved the scallops and even the European breakfast was good for morning."}
{"text":"Dined here the evening of May 31st. Eno Vino has consistently great food although I've only ever tried about 1/6 of their menu since they have a lot of options.  Their crostinis for their cheese board need a little olive oil and pinch of salt and pepper over them before they're baked. Overall I would give their food a 3.5 star rating (I don't give 4-5 star ratings often). Go to Field Table on the square for 5 star food. 
The wine selection is wonderful and servers are very prompt in giving tastes of wine before choosing a glass. 
The five star review I'm giving is for my wonderful server Nathan who knocked the full dinner service out of the park!! WAY TO TO NATHAN!  Before we paid I asked him if we could finish our drinks on the outside patio. He continued to keep an eye on us out there and, even though we were out of his jurisdiction of table coverage, he continues our service and brought us two espresso dessert martinis which are fantastic! 

Well done to management. Keep up the good work, Nathan.

{"text":"PLEASE BRING BACK THE TURKEY LEG!


Beautiful place, with a great menu. The first time I went, the turkey leg was our favorite. My entire group was disappointed when we arrived at our last visit and the turkey leg was off the menu. The chicken lollipops were great, but nothing can make up for the succulent turkey leg. The guys in our group were especially bummed out, and although the Brussel sprouts and beet salad were delicious...they REALLY wanted the turkey leg."}
{"text":"Wow, I had a great experience here. The views are amazing, the cocktails creative and well made, and the dishes did not disappoint. The one down side is that the acoustics of the restaurant aren't great, and it's hard to hold a conversation if you're at a larger table.  A few highlights: the brussel sprouts and the scallops and squid ink pasta special. The entrance is a little confusing - you have to enter the hotel lobby and take the elevator up to the restaurant - follow the signs!"}
{"text":"I have just arrived at Madison's newest hot spot with views that will ensure instant success. An automatic must see/do whether you're a visitor or a lifer!
Sitting atop Madison's newest hotel, you're immediately blown away by with the most stunning view of the Capitol that only a select few Madisonian's have ever been witness to! What's amazing is there are two floors of stupendous views! If the Capital bores you, turn to your left and the view of Lake Monona may keep your interest going. There are no bad views.
The food is just as good as the original location albeit a whole different menu with a couple stalwart carry-overs. The Shrimp Ceviche is mouthwatering with citrus coming through the vinaigrette...and it's not too spicy. (y'all know how much I like spicy heat....NOT!) The Sea Bass and Scallops are a must! As with the suburban location, no visit is complete without an order of the (carry-over) Truffle Fries...as good as it gets! If you're really hungry, try the Turkey Leg Confit. The meat of the full leg literally falls off the bone and the flavors are amazing! We didn't have enough room to order more but if these first bites are an indication, they've hit it out of the park!
The wine menu almost mirrors the suburban location which was a great relief as I now have two places to order a wonderful Coté du Rhone! (give it a try!) They also have a full bar, which was good for the guys next to me ordering Old Fashioned's.
The only knock on the whole experience? Parking. It will be difficult but then, any place downtown is. It's a small price to pay.
Do yourself a favor and cancel your next night's plans, grab your best girl, and get to Eno Vino on top of the new AC Hotel. 
You will send me thank you notes."}
{"text":"Love the view. Love the Wine. Love the staff. The food is working it's way up, but hasn't impressed me completely. I would love to see a better late night menu other than just two options. The wine menu could use some rotation. I haven't seen it change since they've opened. If it has, it's been very minimal. Overall, the ambiance is amazing for a late night drink or day time scenic view of the city. I enjoy having this place so close to downtown."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Anthony! Makes you feel like family and offers his suggestions and is honest about it :-) the view can't be beat and I know it sounds weird but ladies you should make sure to check out the bathroom. Almost the best view in the place! Great happy hour and awesome creme brûlée."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I've been an admirer of the first location for years so the spectacularly located second restaurant three blocks from my home is a great addition to the neighborhood. The food is outstanding as is the service, with the views virtually unbelievable. Do yourself a favor and visit Eno Vino."}
{"text":"The views and the drinks save this place. Having good experiences with the west side eno, I was not impressed by the food. 

After waiting an uncomfortably long time, our gnocchi came out. Upon setting it on the table, the waitress noticed there was a hair in the dish and quickly whisped it back to the kitchen. My dining partner was confident that same bowl of gnocchi came right back out to the table next to us. 

Then after waiting another long period of time we finally got gnocchi. The flavor, the texture, bleh. Unlike anything... and not in a good way. 

While I'm sure some of the other food may me great, our gnocchi experience was not. I much prefer the Olive Garden gnocchi...................."}
{"text":"After attending a private party my partner and I were interested in dining. When we talked to the hostess we were informed that dining was based on a reservation system and they were booked for over an hour. We ended up eating at the bar with a view of the dinning room  there were empty tables in the dining room the entire time we were there. I have lived in Madison my entire life and have never had such unwelcoming and dismissive treatment. Not a good business model"}
{"text":"Love this place. Rosa was an amazing server! Wonderful service and phenomenal food. Me and four friends got a couple bottles of wine and shared the cheese board, bruschetta, and truffled fries."}
{"text":"You can't beat the view here! It is a cool, trendy atmosphere, but it's pricy. I have only tried the tomato soup on the food menu, and that was really good. It came with little slices of grilled cheese for dipping, which made it even better. Overall, a nice place to grab a drink or two with an app, especially in the summer if you can snag a spot on the amazing patio."}
{"text":"EnoVino downtown offers a beautiful view of the capitol and nice and not overpriced wine list. Unfortunately, these are more or less the 2 good pros. The place is loud, the waiter was probably the most obnoxious one I've ever had (you know the type, trying to act cool at the cost of being insistent and intrusive), the food was mediocre. 
Let me tell you more about the food. We ordered fries, bruschettas, and pretty much every seafood item on the menu. Everything is soooo covered in sauces and spices that you can't really taste much of the seafood. For example, the lobster was tempura-style with some salad. The taste was good, but you could not tell at all that it was lobster. It just tasted like fried breading. Overall, I didn't eat well, but I spent too much for glorified pub food."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your out-of-town guests (although I would also say it is a fantastic place to hang for locals as well). The view of the Capital is incredible. I also think they have really good food. Last time I was there, I ordered the cheapest bottle of Pinot Grigio to share with friends, and it was very good, especially considering it was only $22. My go-to food choices are definitely the truffled fries (with three kinds of dipping sauces) and the goat cheese tortellini. I would highly recommend making a reservation in advance (several days if you have a big party) if you want to sit in the restaurant. Every time I have come here I have opted for the bar (which is first come, first serve) and have lucked out by getting all of the comfortable chairs near the fireplace. Definitely a place you should check out if you have not already."}
{"text":"As one of the only rooftop bars in Madison, this is one of my favorite places in town, especially now that it's warm!!! 
They have gahhhgeous views of the Capitol and the city. So, if you want a dope insta pic or a new fb profile pic with your hunny make a stop here!
The drinks are amazing and the service was great.
The only downfall is that it is always super busy and there isn't a ton of room to stand/sit. I recommend this as a pre or post dinner stop because you will likely be standing the entire time and get bumped into at least twice."}
{"text":"We have been to Eno Vino before in there other madison location. The food at the downtown location was awesome as expected. The location is amazing. Awesome views of the capital building and the lake! Great place to go!"}
{"text":"Eno Vino is incredible. I actually didn't know this place existed until my chiropractor said I should take out-of-town guests there. So off we went! Both the Madisonians and the two Kansas Citians all fell in love with this place during our visit. And the two Madisonians loved it enough to revisit a few weeks later!

Pros:
-Wine: All of the wine I've tried has been really phenomenal. The servers during both visits were very knowledgeable when explaining the wine if I had questions. They also both offered samples.
- Cheese: During our first visit, the four of us split a cheese board, and it was to die for. Graze and the Old Fashioned have incredible cheese curds, but the best raw cheese award goes to Eno Vino for its cheese board.
- Food: During our second visit, we ate a full dinner at Eno Vino. Sure, it's pricey, but the food is very good, very fresh, very well-thought-out, and the plating is quite pretty.
- Service: During the two times I've been to Eno Vino so far, I've had great service. Both servers were friendly, very attentive and very professional. The service has been top-notch.
-Views: This goes without saying. Even the women's bathroom has a view. The bathroom is situated on the corner of the building, so you get to enjoy an even better view of downtown than the fantastic view you already get from the restaurant area. Take your wine with you to the bathroom and just hang out and enjoy the view. I haven't actually done that, but I think I might do that next time!

Cons:
- My husband thought the prawns in the garlic-roasted prawn dish did not taste fresh. He was drinking red wine, which may have affected the taste for him. I had white wine, and I thought the dish was incredible. It was the most authentic Italian dish I've eaten in the U.S. since I spent 10 days in Italy last year.
- The decor in the dining area is sort of boring. The tables are positioned to where you look at either wall, instead of being positioned to look at either the windows on one end or the cooks on the other end. I personally think the view out the windows and/or watching the kitchen would have been much more interesting than staring at the modern twisty metal thing on the plain wall.

Eno Vino will definitely be on my list of places to take out-of-town guests for a quick appetizer/drinks and/or a full dinner. It's a very interesting place, unique only to Madison, with fantastic food, service and drinks!"}
{"text":"The rooftop Eno Vino is what it is because of the views. Great place to grab a drink and a snack. If you're going for dinner be ready to dish out some cash for small plates. For people visiting, I would deff suggest this spot. If you want to sit outside, arrive 10 minutes before opening."}
{"text":"Amazing views, decent drink selection and good flatbreads make this a solid choice for a date. Split a flatbread and some sides and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, day of our anniversary. Sat at bar, spent $140 in two hours with three people, and the place was PACKED on a Friday evening with pretty aces. Good service, high prices, and you realize you are paying for the ambiance and the view. 

And you decide it's worth it.

Had Brussels sprouts, flatbread and two bottles of sparkling wine. Food was great, but small portions. Will come back for special events, but will not become a regular. If I want dinner, I'll try to make it over to the west side location."}
{"text":"My wife and I along with another couple celebrated 2 birthdays last night at Eno Vino.  Great time. Wonderful food. View was nice even through the rain. Our server Brian was amazing. He told us he was still in training, we thought he was joking. He was very professional, knowledgeable, kind, and confident.  He made great suggestions which were spot on. He shared travel stories and made us feel very special. Highly recommend this restaurant and Brian to anyone looking for a wonderful night. We will be back indeed."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pretty great, and I really like both glasses of wine I ordered. Also, the food was pretty darn tasty. Our favorite were mini tacos, which was surprising. The fries were a good choice, and I really enjoyed the poke poke. Everything was pretty expensive, but given the location, you can't be too surprised. At least the prices are worth it, in my opinion. And next time I'll remember that one plate per person is plenty for me."}
{"text":"I found Eno downtown disappointing. The views are lovely but... Uncrisp fries. Pasta stuffed with cream cheese, which just doesn't work. A salad that was way overdressed and poorly plated. Soggy bruschetta. A lackluster cheese plate. A waitress who smashed herself (meaning her behind) into our table in order to photograph the next table without a single word to us. A group of ten who used our table as a photo staging ground as we were being seated, leaving us awkwardly stranded for much too long and again not one word from the host seating us. A piecemeal arrival of dishes we clearly meant to be simultaneously ordered such that someone's dish came out long after everyone else was full. It was also (on a Thursday) packed, which some people may like, but I found it difficult to get a reasonably timed reservation a couple days out. The location in middleton seems better managed and higher quality."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. First of all great views and cocktails are pretty good. They know how to shake and stir em. We had a shit ton of stuff I was there for a work function with work so it all kind of blurred together but we literally had at least two of everything I was disappointed with nothing."}
{"text":"Gordon, a manager, was amazing tonight. He saved the day with unique cocktails for our friends birthday! We tried to tip him, but he left before us! Thanks so much, Gordon! You deserve a raise!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the view at the Capitol location -- I would find a reason to return just for that. The menu is interesting, presentation is clever, but ultimately I found the food a little underwhelming. If you like heavily sauced and dressed food, you'll probably be happy.  If you prefer to let ingredients speak for themselves, you might not be. Service could be improved. Example: if you ask for your tableware to be replaced because it has fingerprints, water spots, and smears all over it, a server should take care of that in about 1 minute, not more than 5 minutes. Especially when everyone at your table has been served and would like to eat. And when plates are empty, they should be removed promptly."}
{"text":"I had a very positive experience at Eno Vino's westside location but would not likely return to this one, admittedly for problems that likely stem from the location itself and the volume of patrons that it attracts. Nothing was egregious, but enough iffy factors piled up. We had a reservation, but they didn't actually have a table. (A very stressed out host scrambled to find us a new table, one that actually had a better view and wasn't in the very loud inside dining room.) The server was pleasant, but clearly overstretched, harried throughout our entire encounter and struggling to fulfill small requests promptly. Beyond that, the cocktails were downright weak and overall pretty bland. That's pretty bad when the cocktail game has gotten pretty serious in Madison (Forequarter, Gibbs, Heritage, etc). The food was fine, but the atmosphere conspires against anyone actually being able to enjoy it. Beyond the fact that the wait staff is clearly on edge, we were surrounded by people constantly jockeying to take selfies with the Capitol behind them, bachelorette parties, some older dude creepily shooting pictures of one such bachelorette party... My advice? Go for a beer or glass of wine and just enjoy the view OR go to Eno Vino's west side location."}
{"text":"Good points: the view, the location, the modern and chic atmosphere and decor, good foreign wine, the relatively good service.
The meh points: prices are high for food, draft beer selection is thin, and the level of noise inside the bar.
Personal experience: beer, proseco, gewurztraminer were good. Fast service on drinks.
we ordered a cheese plate that took more than 30minutes to be served, which was definitely way too long for the type of food... it arrived with half the cheeses ordered. When our server realized that he jumped on the manager and took the food away from the check, which was very nice.
We asked another server for additional bread for the cheese, but never saw it.
The cheese plate was very small for the price, and we are glad we did not have to pay for it"}
{"text":"Great ambiance,vibe, and layout of this establishment.  Located on the 10th floor of the AC Hotel, you have a great view of the lake and down town Madison.  I ordered the grilled octopus and crab cake.  The portions are small, but delicious.  A bit pricey for the serving size."}
{"text":"This place is one of those places if you want to impress your date with how expensive your taste can be with small portions of food. It's a tapas restaurant so everything is made to be shared and for taste. 

We got the lamb meatballs which was $13. It comes with three meatballs and two slices of bread. It was good. Nice texture for a meatball. It was soft and pretty good size. It was a bit on the vinegary side but I think it was the acidity of the tomato sauce on top. The sauce was so good! It was vinegary but somewhat sweet. 

Also got the chicken lollipop. This was $15. You get three chicken lollipops. It was with moody bleu cream. It's a sauce where you dip the chicken in. I would describe it as cheddar bacon dip. The chicken was on a bed of shiitake giardiniera. It's with onions and jalapeños. 

We also got the foie gras. It's $18. It's about an ounce or two of seared foie gras. It was really good. Good texture and cooked right. It's a little bit of rich flavor like a buttery flavor and texture. It comes with foie gras mousse which fluffy and to me, flavorless. I thought it was just there for display and filling. It's served on top of raspberry jam and thin apple slices and raspberry and almonds surrounding it. I thought it was an interesting mix. It was sweet and overpowering the foie gras.

They have over 300 selections of wine if you're into that. The wines are pretty good and inexpensive.

The service was great. It was just weird they were cleaning like crazy while we were still in there. They were moving tables and cleaning the floors. One server was even under the table nearby cleaning up. 

I would recommend this place if you like to try different kinds of gourmet meals and also if you're not hungry. The portions are small. It's also expensive."}
{"text":"Great dinner, friendly and efficient server (Rosa), and really good drinks (Rosa made sure that they were good, as we told her that they were pretty weak last time).  The pork tacos and Thai Chicken flatbread pizza are so good, it is hard to try anything else.  Limoncello Collins and White Sangria are two really sweet drinks.  Of course the view is outstanding.... I prefer to be in the bar, looking out at the lake rather than the Capitol building (knowing who is in that beautiful building would ruin my appetite)."}
{"text":"Eno Vino never fails to impress. I've been here during peak hours, and at times when I'm one of 5 people in the bar. Each and every time, I've been made to feel special! 

From long conversations about wine re-carbonating methods, to getting free food because of minor chef mistakes, Eno Vino has proven they are dedicated to customer service"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the food or anything else here, this review is strictly for the atmosphere, location, and views.  If you're looking for a place to get after dinner drinks, perhaps a happy hour drink.... this is the place to be.  At the top of the Ace Hotel this place is beautiful.  We walked in here after dinner down the street on the way back to our hotel.  And wow.... the views are spectacular.  And in addition to that, the atmosphere inside made you feel like you were at an upscale bar on the Las Vegas strip or in Los Angeles.  Very hip, very trendy.  Super nice.  The wait staff were all very nice and attentive.  The bar was beautiful and clean.  Sweeping views of the Capitol and city.  And the windows are pretty much floor to ceiling so it was beautiful.  We looked around at what others were eating and it looked great."}
{"text":"Food is Good but pricey. Go with family on Sunday evening for less noise. Every dish is meant to share."}
{"text":"We ate earlier then we typically do to avoid the noise and were rewarded with good food and service and an amazing view of the Capitol!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location. Friendly and prompt. Our waiter was able to talk us through the entire menu and recommended some of the best. We started with a tomatillo & avocado (spicy aftertaste - amazing), prosciutto (absolutely mouthwatering - we should have gotten more), and fresh mozzarella (I prefer diced tomato but whole tomato works, and is good!) Bruschetta which was exquisite. Next came calamari fries with a side of the house red sauce, again.. exquisite. Coated with red pepper flakes to add some spice and paired with the red sauce was everything together was flavorful. After readjusting my pants, the hanger steak came out & it was simply put one of the best steaks I've had in quite some time. The mashed potatoes along with the glaze takes it over the top. Dessert is a must and we took the berry tart with a scoop of ice cream to pull it all together and we could barely get out of our seats, and didn't really want to as we watched the sunset over the Capitol. We did try three different drinks, the all natural went down smooth as well as the Vampiro. Hats off chefs, bartenders and waiting staff!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the views. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Marriott, which is only a block or so from the capital. They have an outdoor area (we didn't go outside though) and huge windows throughout. You can also see part of the kitchen from the dining area, which is pretty cool. 

We went on a Saturday night at 8 and got seated right away (although we might have just a got lucky). By the time we left, there weren't any open tables. Our server, Guy, was friendly and attentive but the food took a long time. 

When you're seated, they put an iPad on the table as well so that you have an even bigger drink selection that the printed menu. 

It's a tapas place in that they serve small dishes (not Spanish themed). We ordered the Gnocchi, truffle fries, goat cheese ravioli, and scallops, but it was a lot of food. We would have been better with only needed 3 for the two of us.  The gnocchi in particular was great- it melts away in your mouth. All of the food was good, but a bit expensive. 

Seems like you could've asked for bread based on looking around, but we didn't realize so we didn't get any.

All in all, Great Saturday night dinner!"}
{"text":"Great date night spot or to take out-of-town friends for a killer capital view, friendly and professional service, and good drinks and food!

Within the Marriot and good amount of street parking. If you want to do happy hour, you have to sit in the bar/cocktail area. 

Comp sourdough bread was with this sort of sweet and sour cream cheese spread that was super delicious. We asked for more! 

The Ginger mojito was also very yummy and just strong enough.

I recommend the scallops (seared perfectly and went great with the corn), and the shrimp risotto (if available, was a chef's special). 

Brussels sprouts are meh, get if you feel like you need something healthy.

The foie gras didn't cut it for me. Very little amount in ratio to the bread and the fruit preserves was way too sweet and overpowered the foie gras saltiness.

Creme brûlée was DELISH.  Stacked with fresh raspberry preserves at the bottom (not that canned stuff) and a brownie cake in the middle. So yum. Should get!"}
{"text":"Went here for a girls night out and will definitely be back! You 100% need a reservation, especially on the weekend. Food was great, prices good too, and you can't beat that view!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Cmon Yelp, halves matter!!!

Trying out more than a single location of a fine dining joint would imply one really enjoys their food! I'd certainly say that was our intent as we love Eno Vino's West Side location!! However...this one was an interesting conundrum as the Service spilled disappointment juice all over our evening!

Decor : Fabulous with the full wall wine rack, sophisticated with industrial art decor and with the City Hall in the background as your view, it sure does make for one gorgeous setting to dine! I'd easily give it a 5/5

Service : At best a 3/5. Strangely enough, the service here was miles apart from the rather upscale feel we received at their other location. Our server barely came by to check on us, could care less to explain the nuances of each dish and it took a whole lot of time to get the courses coming. If it weren't for their sweet gesture to give us a complimentary dessert as it was wife's birthday, I'd give them 2.5/5.

Food : Drab service aside, thankfully the food still held it's own and left our bellies satiated! We kicked off the Tapas Style concept with a set of Grilled Octopus and Poke Poke. The Octopus was delicate and juicy and char on it went very well with the tangier cilantro chutney! The roasted baby potatoes were cooked just right as well. Poke Poke was a brilliant dish as it showcased 2 versions of poke - the tuna on a bed of seaweed and the salmon in a sweet spicy mayo dressing. Both fish were very fresh and whether eaten as is or piggybacked on the well made wontons, were very tasty.

Our next set was Hanger Steak and Seabass and Scallops. The steak was perfectly cooked and I absolutely loved the balsamic glaze on it. The mashed potato was silky and smooth as butter and the fried kale added a fun \"crunch\" element to the dish. The seabass and scallops dish had the scallops cooked exactly how you would want them with just the right natural sweetness of theirs standing out. The seabass fillet was a bit thin to be honest thus making its coating too crunchy for such a delicate fish. The beurre blank sauce was sinful!

Lastly, our dessert was their famous Creme Brulee. Perhaps one of THE best creme brulee Ive had so far. The layers of brownie, fruit compote go so well with the custard that once youve had it all together, you cant possibly imagine having a \"spartan\" creme brulee afterwards!!

So, in the end, my love for Eno Vino continues. Just perhaps not to this particular location."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Great view of the capital building! Great attention to detail!"}
{"text":"Come here for the view alone.  Most likely, when you arrive, you will mutter the same as I did, \"This does not feel like Madison\".  Eno Vino occupies two floors-the 9th with a small bar, seating area, and outside deck along with the 10th with a larger bar and large dining room.  During summer, try to grab a spot of the patio as the views are amazing.  The menu is similar to that of their space on the West side with dishes designed to be shared.  They feature an extensive wine list (both bottle and by the glass) as well as craft cocktails and beer.  Foodwise, there are a few standouts for me.  I felt the best was the seared scallops and sea bass.  I would get that every time I stopped in.  The calamari fries, although smaller than what I remember, are also a solid choice.  Sadly, their Finocchiona flatbread (goat cheese, fennel, brussel sprouts) was flavorless.  Roasting the brussel sprouts before baking the pizza, I feel, would have helped.
Service was fast and amicable and the spot truly is beautiful.  An excellent spot for a date, business dinner, or just to have a sip of wine and watch as the sun sets behind the Capitol."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. This is located on the top floor of a hotel near the capitol. Beautiful view, but kind of difficult to grab seats without a reservation. It was initially a confusing time when we were told there would be a several hour wait while a group of four behind us rushed towards the bar seats (we learned after the fact it is \"open seating\" around there). Drinks are tasty and a bit pricier for Madison (but for the view and sit-down restaurant, not a big deal), running $9-11 for more regular mixed drinks and $11-14 for the fancier ones. The sangria and mojitos were tasty. The food was very enjoyable though. We ordered the truffle fries, calamari fries and a flatbread sans goat cheese. The prices initially seemed a bit high, but the portions were enormous, so well worth the splurge to share. I definitely recommend the truffle fries (wonderfully hot and crispy with that delicious truffle flavor). The calamari was likewise, filling but I felt the breading got to be too heavy after awhile and I had no complaints about the flatbread. The overall ambiance would definitely be romantic if it wasn't so loud and crowded.

Overall, this is a fancier place I'd take some people from out of town for drinks and a great view, but maybe avoid peak hours. I'd probably come back during a happy hour to check it out."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Our first visit.
View is spectacular from the 10th floor of AC Hotel!
Our server, Nick, could not have been more helpful. The calamari fries wete a generous portion, perfectly breaded and pleasantly spicy with a terrific house tomato sauce. The sausage/mushroom flatbread was equally pleasing and some came home with us-bonus!
Impressive wine list (of course). Our first visit...not our last."}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the AC hotel that Eno resides in. 
What an amazing hotel bar! The view of the Capitol is incredible from the huge windows that make up bar side. 

They also have two separate outdoor patios. One on the 10th floor where the main restaurant is, and one down on the 9th floor. 

I tried the gnocchi and tacos. Both of which were well prepared with good flavor. They were on the small plate menu, but either would work by themselves for a light eater. 

The bar is where this place shines though. They have over 400 bottles on their wine list, and the make excellent craft cocktails. They whipped up one of the best Old Fashioned I've ever had. 

If it's busy upstairs try the smaller downstairs space on 9 as a tip. I'll definitely visit anytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"Honestly, the service is great. The food is good, but overpriced in my opinion. I really like the flatbreads.

The reason that this place gets three stars is because of the ridiculous wait sometimes. I went to meet up with 5 friends and didn't put in a reservation, but when we asked in person they said it was a 3 hour wait. I looked into the dining room and it was mostly EMPTY. There was maybe one table with patrons. How is is possible to have a 3 Hour wait on a Friday starting at 6PM with only one table filled? 

We ended up sitting/standing at the bar and we got great service. The crostini were fantastic. Get one of each. We were there for a good 2 hours and the dining room was still not at full capacity. We could have done the dining room, but they were \"booked.\" What a disappointment. We probably won't go back as a group without a reservation. It's definitely not a good place to go if you decide last minute. 

I heard weekdays are not as busy as Friday-Saturday. 

Tip: Get the flatbreads and crostini to share. Totally worth it and delicious!"}
{"text":"We came here on a busy Friday night and found a seat at the bar. They have a great view of the capitol from their restaurant. The food was delicious and so were the drinks. I love the concept of tapas/sharing plates so naturally I knew that I would enjoy this place. We had a flatbread, calamari and some fries. Everything was perfectly cooked and amazingly delicious.

Service was a bit slow but what do you expect on a Friday night right?"}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) stellar views
2) great food
3) nice atmosphere

Love love love this new spot! At the top of the AC Hotel, the views of the city are amazing. This would be a great spot to take people from out of town (or anyone really) so that they can view the gorgeous Capital. 

With Eno Vino being new, even on week nights the place is packed creating a fun and upbeat atmosphere. 

The menu is basically the same as the Eno Vino west side location with a few twists, and of course the wine selection is excellent. Be warned, this is a \"small plate\" restaurants but the portions are actually quite large. Eno Vino isn't super gluten free friendly but the servers can help you navigate the menu. 

We tried the frites, the turkey leg, a cheese board, and the pork belly (basically like pork rinds), and the fondue. We were completely stuffed and all of the food was excellent. There really is something for everyone on every menu. 

Try this spot out for some great food, wine and views!"}
{"text":"My partner and I made reservations here for dinner on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday. Since I do not live in town, we chose this location based on a recommendation from some friends who had recently been there and said the drinks were good. The restaurant is located in the Marriott, and has its own elevator that goes directly to the restaurant on the left of the main elevators and the front desk. 

In truth I'd like to give Eno Vino 3.5 stars, because I do hate that my experience was soured by a rude hostess, but as we were there for a special occasion, which was mentioned in the reservation as well as by the hostess in question and our waiter, and the hype surrounding this place, I stand by three stars. We were seated at a four top table, on the far side from the window. When I requested if we could sit next to the window, or perhaps a bit closer, the hostess informed us that those were reserved for reservations that specifically requested it in their reservation, despite the reservation system specifically stating that they cannot guarantee window seating. I mentioned that there was no indication of that in the reservation system and she just sort of...looked at me? Stared down until we just sat and never even explained the reasoning. Three two top window seats remained available throughout the hour and a half of our meal. It was a super disappointing start to what should have been a great meal. When our waiter came over and started to mention that we were celebrating, I declined and stated that I did not want to celebrate there, and to his credit he was very kind about it.

The food was great. Nothing mind blowing, but it all tasted very good. The plates are perfectly sized to share with one other person, and between the two of us we shared five plates and each had a cocktail. My favorites were the Sea Bass and Scallops and the Foie Gras Duo, both of which really made the usually mild flavors of the ingredients shine. We also opted for the Chef's Special of the night, which was a short rib wonton. The idea of a rotating plate that's specially designed every so often is one of my favorite things they provide. I really loved the Espresso Martini, and the balance of flavors it provided. At the end of the meal, our waiter did come back and say that he knew we declined to celebrate that evening, but indicated that he was aware it was a birthday since he had checked our IDs for drinks; he offered dessert on the house if we wanted, which at least ended dinner on a better note.

Overall, I do think it's a little overrated. Obviously the view of the Capital is really nice, and the food is good, but as far as price aligning with service, I only get to visit Madison every other month, and there are other restaurants in the area that I'd be more willing to return to."}
{"text":"Came here for a colleague get together. The service was good, wine was excellent, and food was small plate which I love. From what I heard all of it was good. It was good for me too but I had all veggie options. It was a little loud, so probably not a romantic place or a place for deep convos."}
{"text":"Great view here but the service was a bit of a mess. I tried to come here for a birthday gathering with friends last night. Turned out there was a reservation glitch and the hostess gave us a hard time despite other staff trying to be accommodating. We then offered to sit at the bar facing the windows and waited 20 minutes and were never served. The hostess clearly saw us trying to flag her or other wait staff down but chose to ignore us. We were really disappointed and likely won't be back. We were completely fine with not getting a table but would have appreciated friendlier service."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time trying to go here. I've been to the junction road location many times and had great experiences so was looking forward to checking out the new downtown space. We read that you don't need reservations, but we weren't in a rush, so the host said they would put our party of 4 down and text us in 30-45 min. We happily went off down the street to another place to wait. We never got a text and were disappointed we didn't get to check this place out. After reading other reviews here from people who had the same experience, we likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Unfortunately on a Sunday night Red Sushi was booked, Morris Ramen was closed , and because we were on the square we decided to give Eno Vino a try instead of going down to Sardines. Our server, I wish I got her name , was annoying to the point of it being inappropriate ... It's 2017 , people don't just walk around Madison with a blindfold on hoping to make it all the way up to Eno Vino having no idea what type of a place it is. Don't give us a dreadfully long speech on how this is a \"exclusive\" restaurant, \"it's all about the view\" , \"small plates , 2 to 3 plates per person\" , etc., etc. We already know that you serve food, have wine, and the place has a view! Otherwise we never would have came. 
Instead you should have told us the specials for the night and items that were listed on menus that were not available!! 
For the 3 of us , we ordered 10 items. We knew we ordered heavy , but this was way way too much food. The servings were huge!
The bruschetta was seriously, the largest I have ever seen. The bread was not grilled or toasted, it seemed like bread that was just air drying all day. They used precooked shrimp in the ceviche and when we got two of our main entrees to go, they put it in the same to go dish, which then got mixed together. I could go on and on , but I hope you get the idea."}
{"text":"I love the west side location but experienced the downtown location for the first time today. Have nothing but good things to say. Food was all delish! We had the pork belly BLT(my husband LOVED it), the Brussels sprouts, four different bruschettas and piquillo peppers. The wine was delightful and reasonably priced.  The views were exceptional as was our waiter Anthony. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been here two times and both have been pleasant experiences. The real reason you come here is for the view and then stay for the delicious drinks and food. 

The drinks and food are pricey, but they are very tasty. For a date nights or wine and appetizers with friends this is and ideal spot. When I as here last we had the truffle fries, gnocchi s and four cheese flat bread.

The truffle fries were rich and came with three dipping sauces. My favorite was a tangy ketchup that they make. It also came with a garlic aioli and cheese fondue. 

The gnocchi were in a red sauce with panchetta. The panchetta was a nice touch and off set the rich tomato sauce. This was my favorite out of the three things that night. I am a sucker for some good pasta! 

Last was the cheese flat bread. They used some very rich cheese, this was a nice touch. It would have been nice to have some marinara to dip it in as it was just cheese with basil on the flat bread. 

Everything I have tried here I would order again. The menu is large so you do have many options depending on what you like. Like I said it is pricey but every once and awhile this is a nice place to try."}
{"text":"I'm giving Eno Vino three stars.... I wish I could give it five, but it just didn't live up to expectations.  

First, the positives:   The views are the best in Madison.  It is a beautiful setting and a beautiful space.  \"Energetic\" best describes the atmosphere.  No intimate conversations here.   

The highlight of our experience was our waiter, Jose.   He was excellent at providing stellar service under less than ideal circumstances.   

When we arrived for our 7:15 reservation, we were told that it would be a \"few\" minutes.  40 minutes later, we were finally seated.  Jose was quick to come to our table and welcome us. We placed a drink order, and---unfortunately----it took over 15 minutes to get our drinks.  (Not Jose's fault).   

We ordered our food; an eclectic mix of small plates that were delivered well prepared.  Unfortunately, they were out of several items we were looking forward to trying.  When it came time for dessert, we were informed that all they had left was the chocolate fondue.  We opted to go somewhere else for dessert.  

We will return and give Eno Vino another chance.  The restaurant just opened and we chalked up the issues with an obvious learning curve that they are experiencing.

Jose made the experience very pleasant, in spite of the other issues we experienced."}
{"text":"Great view, good drinks, but they have a gnat problem. Disgusting! Especially for a problem that's easily resolved."}
{"text":"Tapas food that is only so-so. My soup du jour was lukewarm. Ginger mojito tasted mostly like fountain lemon lime soda with mint in it. Crab cakes were lukewarm. Cheese plate was skimpy. Waiter completely forgot the prawn order. Looks very high end but food was fair to middling. Daughter got two kiddie cocktails. These came to $12. Really? For spritzer and some fruit? 

If you want good high end tapas and a mix of large and small plates, go a few doors down to Heritage. Or hit Graft."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance and incredible food! Small plate style with an impressive wine list. A perfect wine bar in an unpretentious setting."}
{"text":"I called yesterday at 6pm and asked if a reservation was needed for drinks on the patio and was told no that it is on a first come first serve basis and that it can have a wait sometimes. I went with one other girlfriend at 8:30 and entered the hotel and went over by the elevators. There was a woman there who asked if we had reservations and I said no we were only there to have a drink on the patio. She said they were at capacity. I said that was okay and we would like to be put on the waiting list considering no other people were around in the lobby. She said it would be at least an hour wait and I said that was fine and gave her my name and cell phone number. Hours and hours went by and I never received a text or call saying that we could go to have a drink on the patio. 

Incredibly disorganized location. I find it incredibly rude that I was told no reservation was needed, then was added to a wait list (with no other people around) AND never received a text saying that we could have a drink on the patio. I was completely ignored and pushed aside. I would be happy to speak with someone at this location about my circumstances."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be a health hazard. I ordered a drink and asked the bartender for a few extra maraschino cherries. He proceeded to stick his entire bare hand in the jar and plopped the cherries in a separate glass, after having just took my credit card to pay for the drink. Absolutely disgusting! I understand that they are busy, but there's absolutely no excuse for that. I will not be coming back to this location, the Westside one is infinitely better."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for a drink because I had heard about the wonderful view.  We were able to snag a seat at the window when another couple was leaving.  We had a gorgeous view of the capital and really loved watching the sunset.  Even though the space was full, were were still able to chat and easily hear one another.  The waiter was attentive without hovering and we both enjoyed our fun cocktails.  It was a nicer vibe so make sure to put on something nice before coming out but it works for a couple as well as for groups of people.  If coming with a group, arrive earlier on the weekend or be willing to split up or have some stand until a space clears out that works for you.  I will be planning a trip back so that we can also enjoy some of the food offerings but this visit was for drinks only."}
{"text":"Amazing views and amazing service. Came for drinks, and Jordan was great! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Wowee sooo delicious and the view is great of the Capital. Different kinds of bruschetta., shrimp ceviche, and calamari fries with a great spicy dipping tomato sauce. We wanted to try the truffle fries but couldn't fit them."}
{"text":"You come here for upscale, but sort-of-keeping-it-casual type of dates and/or if you want to have drinks/cocktails with mesmerizing view of the city, especially at night. If you are seated at the right spot, the view is simply amazing!

The cocktails were great, but pricey. In fact, a lot of the items on the menu tend to be on the pricier side of things and your bill will easily run around the Benjamins if you're with friends. But, the food doesn't disappoint. I still remember their calamari; it's is typically more than what I would pay for, but it was soooo good. It was succulent, fried perfectly and I don't know what kind of culinary sorcery they use to make it taste so heavenly!

It's *very* busy, especially during the evenings or happy hours. During these times, the service can get be slow and, if you're at the bar, you may have a hard time finding a good seat (or any seat). Also, the bartenders at the bar may be slow to get to your order. Nevertheless, I would recommend this place to my friends who are looking to take their dates for an upscale dinner or who are looking to get drinks with gorgeous views. 

Also, apparently, the view from the restroom is gorgeous."}
{"text":"I live the original Eno vino way better in term of serving speed and quality of services including the way cheeseboard is not being served with wood board here in downtown location. Foods are still good. But table is small. AC is not strong. And very very noisy"}
{"text":"15 minutes into our meal a woman at a nearby table yelled \"why are you doing this to us?\"... she didn't yell loud enough.

Let me start off by saying I never leave reviews and would give Eno Vino on Junction Road 6 stars all day, every day. The new Eno Vino downtown is like an airport version of the original. For the TLDR crowd: food is good not great, drinks are mediocre at best, and the service is hot garbage. Here are the highlights:

- Called 20 minutes before our res to say we were running 15 minutes late and the host on the phone said \"I would hate for you to have to cut your dinner short, we are fully booked all night\" implying that we would be kicked out if we ran a few minutes over our allocated dinner time, which was on a Tuesday

- Hostess had no idea what to do with us when we arrived (a four top with a reservation) and told us she couldn't leave her hostess stand to figure it out.  Took an extra 10 minutes to be seated

- Food came out before drinks

- Food came out incorrect but was not taken off the bill 

- Out of numerous wines by the glass on the menu despite just opening 

- Despite the earlier warnings about not being able to finish our dinner at our table there were empty tables in our section the entire night

- Plates stacked up at the table or weren't replaced the entire time. Two runners spilled drinks at our table and didn't offer to replace them. A different runner acted like it was our fault there wasn't room on the table for a 'heavy' plate that he couldn't set down because there were other plates there still

- Dinner lasted 3+ hours due to slow service and inability to get us our bill in a timely manner

- Server took 35 minutes to bring the bill from the first time we asked and then ran it for the wrong amount

- Manager never came to the table to check on us once. Despite being there over 3 hours and having numerous things go wrong

- Manager was in the elevator on the way down as we were talking about how bad the service was and didn't say a word or offer to rectify the situation in any way

Again, food wasn't bad but isn't as good as the original location. Drinks were of significantly lower quality. Service was a joke at every level. I didn't even take the time to list all of the complaints but you get the point... Pretty sure the Rocky's on Tree Lane is run more efficiently than this place. 

With the current management and staff in place I'd be shocked if this place is open in a year."}
{"text":"We made a reservation online for 5:30PM on Friday (wanted to make that happy hour) but accidentally reserved the one on Junction Road instead of this one :( The hostess was so sweet and was able to get us a table even though it was our mistake. We really appreciated it because after a long day at work, we were looking forward to spending time here. 

Small plates are offered and you're encouraged to get a bunch of them -- and we were pretty hungry so that is indeed what we did. I only eat fish when it comes to meat and we let our waiter know that. He gave us suggestions on fish and vegetarian dishes, and even said on some of them, we can remove the meat.

 First we got the bruschetta -- we chose the Mediterranean, Fresh Mozzarella, Smoked Salmon and Tomatillo & Avocado. The Salmon one was my favorite (was basically lox) and the Tomatillo/Avocado was close second. The bread was so soft, which was a pleasant surprise because we expected it to be super crunchy. We then got a bunch of plates that came out in spurts.. The truffle fries come with three different sauces but the homemade ketchup tasted like marinara sauce -- it was nothing too special. The crab cake and brussel sprouts were delicious. With all the sauces and oil, the brussel sprouts were nice and refreshing. We got the goat cheese ravioli without the meat -- it was pretty good but there were just two pieces of ravioli so it didn't feel like we got much of a taste. 

Of course we got wine, I would not be able to remember any of the names, but if you have a preference but are open to suggestions, the staff is very helpful. They will even bring out some samples for you to taste test before committing. 

To sum it up: Great service, beautiful view, decent food and delicious wine. Definitely going to try and come back to sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Yum! So good and unique! Which makes the fact they are tapas even better, so you can try more. And if you like wine, they definitely have one for you."}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal and excellent wine we enjoyed all while enjoying the beautiful views of downtown Madison, the state capital building and the lake.   We will definitely make this a regular stop on our trips to Madison!"}
{"text":"The view is stunning overlooking the capital!! Large wine choices some not as expensive as expected.  

This is a great place to celebrate any special occasion!  We had crab cakes, truffle fries, and flatbread pizza.  The best concept here is to order several few things, great drinks and share them all to experience it all.  

It is a little expensive (at least for me) but the service was great and the experience is amazing!"}
{"text":"A little bit pricey, but mannnn you cannot beat the view of the capital especially on a nice afternoon when you get to sit outside. They serve a wide variety of cheese and meats to go along with it. The servers are definitely knowledgeable and are ready to provide suggestions! Personal favorite cheese choices include: Parmigiano Reggiano from Italy, Manchego from Spain, and the 7 year Aged Cheddar yours truly, WISCONSIN. Pro-Tip: Get there early, save money so you can keep enjoying the view and their food, AND enjoy the a nice sunset over the Madison skyline accompanied by a nice bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"This is a fun hip place for drinks and great food. We hung out outside on their balcony for drinks and apps. For the apps, we had the shrimp ceviche and the fried calamari. The ceviche was incredibly fresh. It had a good amount of avocado and citrus flavors. Very refreshing. Calamari was tender and had great flavor. They had a wide variety of specialty cocktails. Definitely a fun spot worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place definitely has the potential to receive 5/5 but it's not quite there. But before I get to that I'll explain what I really enjoyed about my experience. 

1- The view. Every time I looked out the window at the Capitol I realized I will never get sick of that view. My friend and I came on a pretty stormy night so unfortunately the terrace was closed. That being said, we did have the best seats in the city for the lightning show.

2- The drinks. Yes this is a wine bar, yet we couldn't pass up the cocktails. I got the Vampiro (tequila, lime juice, three in one bitters, agave) and the Cucumber Mint Gimlet ( vodka, mint, cucumber, agave, lime), both of which were very refreshing. My friend got the Jalap-in Your Business (jalapeño-infused tequila, lime juice, orange liqueur, demerara syrup, smoked salt) and the 1 North Webster (mango purée, coconut rum, lime juice, egg whites, white cranberry juice). We also got the Espresso Martini for free because the bartender made a mistake so he just gave it to us. Thankful for that because that one may have been my favorite! 

3- Small plates. I am all about sharing food, so the small plate style here is perfect. We got bruschetta (brie and apple, smoked salmon, mediterranean, and fresh mozzarella), the roasted beet salad (the whipped goat cheese is truly incredible), spicy brussel sprouts, the crab cakes, and finished with the crispy lobster. I don't eat meat so I appreciated the large menu with plenty of vegetarian and seafood options. Next time I come in I definitely want to try the risotto--the woman next to me at the bar ordered not one but TWO consecutive bowls of it, so it must be good! 

4- The service. I read some prior reviews about the mediocre service, however I thought it was great. Coming with a friend who works at the restaurant certainly helps as she knew almost everyone working. Nevertheless, we were well taken care of. Our server, Liz, made us feel taken care of without being too overpowering. She was very well versed with the menu and gave a brief description of each dish as she delivered them to the table. Also the recommendations she gave for food (crab cakes and the crispy lobster) were very helpful! 

Now to the things that kept it from getting a full 5/5: 

1- The layout. This is an enormous space. The tables are set up incredibly close so when it is busy, its almost claustrophobic in there because it's so tight. I honestly think there may be a couple too many tables in the dining room and it would be a lot more comfortable for guests (and servers) if they got rid of a few. 

2- Cleaning while dining. A server was vacuuming/sweeping the carpet of the dining room while people were still enjoying their dinners. Not only was it distracting, but I felt rushed to finish my food because I thought they were maybe closing soon (but they weren't). For such a nice restaurant it was just a bit tacky and not a good business practice.

Thank you Eno Vino!"}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times now since opening. Thought maybe 3rd time could be a charm. 

The views are undoubtedly great - capitol, lake, etc 
Every time I've been here the service is poor and the good is mediocre. 

I was disappointed as I love the one on the west side. If you are just having drinks it's fine. For the amount of money and small plates the service should be better."}
{"text":"Came here it's coworker before dinner at Graft. Located on the 10th floor, this place is great for drinks, HH and bar bites. They have an extensive menu of drinks and bites. We ordered the chicharones with cheddar flavor. Surprisingly good and great portion I also ordered violet the pilot drink with gin. Pretty drink and not too sweet. Just the way I like it. I will definitely be back as I will continue to stay here when we come for business again. TRUST!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a cocktail after dinner. I had a gimlet and my friend had a sangria. Both drinks were delicious and well-made, prices were fair. The service was fast and friendly. The views and interior were gorgeous. It was crowded, but we easily found cushy leather stools by the window. My only minor complaint was that the layout was slightly awkward so it was difficult to get out, with stools blocking every aisle. We loved it though and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I visited Eno Vino Downtown last night for my first time with co-workers for a belated Christmas celebration.   We had a reservation for 6:30 and were promptly seated at a great table by the window.  Three of us had a great view of the capitol and three had a great view of the restaurant.  It would be lovely if the table was perpendicular to the window so we could all have the view but just not possible.  

Our waiter Seth was prompt and friendly.  He was quick to take our drink orders and offer advice.  

We ordered quite a few things and fortunately were able to cancel a few at the end as we couldn't quite finish everything.  

We had a great cheese plate, beet salad, (which does not come with any greens and the salad was so delicious, they weren't missed at all) Poke Poke, Shrimp Ceviche, (one of my favorites) Brussels Sprouts, Risotto, Truffled Fries, Sweet chili calamari fries, crab cakes, pork tacos and finally the scallops.  The scallops were delicious and at $10 per scallop, they should be.  

I tried the ginger mojito which was refreshing and delicious.  After two of them, I decided to switch to an old fashioned  . This was a little too sweet for my taste but it was the end of the night and I didn't feel the need to finish it - and couldn't.  

We did have a few sweets to end the night; a bread pudding with amazing house-made cinnamon ice cream, and old fashioned upside down cake and creme brulee.  All were good but the ice cream really stood out from the rest.    

One thing we had to ask for repeatedly were serving spoons to be able to share our plates.  There were six of us and while we are work family, we didn't really want to use our personal knives and forks to serve food to each other.  We had our plates changed out at least 4 times and I would have kept a dirty plate for a platter of serving forks or tongs.  

I look forward to going back in a different season and watching the sun set.  I'd love to be able to see downtown in the daylight and the  night.  

Oh - and don't miss the restrooms!"}
{"text":"Fun. The tapas are great and the wait staff are more than happy to recommend their favorites. Take your time and share with a significant other for a special night out or just a fancier girls' or boys' night. Great view of Lake Monona. Outdoor seating for that time of the year too. Only complaint is some of the wines are a little over priced -- but, once again, you won't be disappointed by the wine list."}
{"text":"It's been some weeks since we visited, but we quite enjoyed our visit. A comfortable, yet frenetic, stylish and well-run operation. We sampled many of their small plates. They aim for well-executed simple plates that are fresh and yummy, and they hit the mark.
Anything you pick from the menu is going to be well-executed and tasty. The elevator ride is fun and you will gasp at the size of their main dining room. It's impressive. We were lucky to be ensconced on the couches near the stairs, thus making us feel entitled to the occupancy of an entire room. That delusion was ultimately challenged during the evening as fellow diners lined the windows to soak in one of the best views of Madison you can have. Looking forward to our next visit, so I can have more of your food."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have had a great experience every time. Every person I have ever had serve me was even better than the last! They have a really nice indoor area that takes reservations and an open seating patio. All the food I have ordered from here has been excellent and the wine selection is good.
 Additionally, I do not believe there is a better view in all of Madison."}
{"text":"I came to Madison and stayed at the AC Marriott for business. So glad I found Eno Vino!
Fantastic views of the Capitol and lake - watch the sunset on the roof! Great spot to meet friends and take some pictures too.
The outdoor space is a little small but it's certainly worth it. Also lots of space inside with nice views as well. 
Good overall menu with great food - they have lots of apps, flatbreads and larger entrees. I enjoyed the calamari and the cheese plate. Service is friendly and the space is fun and relaxed. 
Amazing find if you are staying at the AC hotel but definitely easy to get to visiting as well. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of Eno Vino from their original location. This downtown location has an unbelievable view! Service needs some work as far as timing the small plates but that will come as they get more experience. They have valet parking which is huge as we went when concert on the square was being held so parking was severely limited downtown. Our food was good, drinks awesome. Highly recommend reservations...great place to take out of town visitors. Side note women, the view from the ladies restroom is unbelievable. Sorry men.."}
