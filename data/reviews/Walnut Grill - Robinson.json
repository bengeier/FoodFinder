{"text":"Ambiance and service were pretty good. Food came out relatively quickly, but our waitress did take a while to come back at the end when we needed our check. Normally not a big deal, but it was lunch hour on a work day so we were in a bit of a hurry. 

Food was okay, but not worth the price. Thai pork mac and cheese was good but could have been better on the cheesiness factor. We ordered the 1/2 sandwich and salad options - buffalo chicken wrap (pretty small serving size for a half but not bad in taste); reuben (the most disappointing item we got. The beef and flavors were good but the salt content was enough to kill a small human); candied walnut salad (pretty good); strawberry balsamic salad (also pretty good but balsamic dressing was goopy and sugary). 

Probably wouldn't come back again since there are many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you're in a hurry. We dined in this past week, with reservations, and it took just shy of two hours to serve our lunch food (sandwiches and flatbreads, nothing crazy). Sever was inattentive. Most restaurants around here are excellent at accommodating working (one hour) lunches.. not Walnut Grill.
Food was good - but I would never come back for lunch."}
{"text":"Food and service is good. Great management, I never had a bad experience. I will continue going there."}
{"text":"Always great food,  have been 4 times to this location,  have never waited for a table,  have never had food I didn't thoroughly enjoy... A new favorite"}
{"text":"Worst experience ... I have worked in restaurant business for over 20!years .. I accidentally spilled a drink and bartender was so rude !!   I went to order another drink and she asked me if I was going to spill this one !!!  We talked to manager but he had no back bone ... Unbelievable that these people have no respect for customers ... I will never be back there or recommend anyone to your restaurant !!
You just lost tons of business !!"}
{"text":"Poor food (for both of us) and service (barely asked how things were and they were not...good)...sorry to say nothing good about the visit"}
{"text":"The service was fabulous, and I loved the Brie quesadilla with raspberry sauce! Unique flavor combo and delicious. My fiancé loved his steak as well. Not sure why this place is rated low. It's a must try."}
{"text":"This place is constantly hit or miss. Mostly misses. The food is usually decent but the service is almost always lacking. I once waited 50 minutes to be served when the restaurant was nearly empty."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!! We had a dinner reservation for a group of 6 people. The waitress immediately told us that they were a little behind and that they might be slow with our food order.  We waited a very long 1 hour and 20 minutes before we received our salads and an additional 20 minutes until we received our food!  An hour and 20 minutes?!!
The restaurant looked fairly busy when we arrived but tables emptied quickly so I'm not understanding the reason for the poor service.  We asked the waitress if they were short of help and she said that they had plenty.
The quality of the food was ok but certainly not worth an hour and 20 minute wait.

This was our 1st and last experience with the Walnut Grill at Settlers Ridge.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Great food!! Excellent chicken salad...didn't receive great service though. My daughters food came and the waitress threw it on the table and didn't say a word. No personality what so ever. But will go back for another delicious pittsburgh salad!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely without a doubt our 25th anniversary dinner was outstanding from the time we walked in to the final goodbye the staff was fantastic. Do yourself a favor and go to this walnut grill you will be glad you did?"}
{"text":"Jim was our Bartender/Server and he was the best!!
We were taken care of quickly and very politely! Jim has a great attitude and is upbeat and really makes you feel comfortable during your visit!! I will definitely return based on Jim and breakfast till 3pm."}
{"text":"I went back for dinner and sat at a booth in the bar area and the service is pretty good. I got the prime rib sandwich and it was pretty good.. I would definitely get that again."}
{"text":"Saturday night, so there was a wait.  Service at the bar was great.  Bar tenders we're friendly and fast.
Once we were seated, our drink food order was quickly taken and the salad came soon afterwards.
Unfortunately, the entre didn't drive for another 40 minutes. That is the only reason they didn't get 5 stars.
The food was excellent.  Well prepared and presented.
We will return."}
{"text":"Manager kicked me out of the patio while I was sitting enjoying a cocktail because he had a bigger party coming in, when there was plenty of space elsewhere in the patio to accommodate.  What a loser - he lost the business of a regular without any care.   Poor customer service - worst I have seen in my whole life all due to that manager."}
{"text":"Great food, great music, no complaints about service.  We were given a very large table which made out party of 7 and a baby very comfortable."}
{"text":"My friend and I met here one night for dinner & I must say it was delicious! We were there during happy hour and took advantage of their $3 appetizers! We had the spinach and artichoke dip, which I highly recommend! It was different from other dips I had before because the artichokes were big slices. But I enjoyed it very much! For my meal I ordered the Pittsburgh Salad with grilled chicken. This salad was topped with the tradition Pittsburgh topping - fries!!! The salad was very large and I took half of it home for lunch the next day. My friend ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, which she says is one of her favorites! It looked very appetizing! Our waitress was super friendly and was very helpful with a digital 10% off coupon that I had received. I will definitely be back - especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Dearest future customers I'd like to let you know I've given this place 3 take out chances and 1 dine in experience and I have nothing great to say. Order with caution. It's not that I have experienced bad tasting food but poor quality service and mediocre presentation and sad all around. My dine in experience wasn't recent but it was slow service but I wanted to give another chance..The past 2 take out orders have had missing food,but this 3rd time will be my last time. My fiancé ordered your $26.00 crab cake dinner and it was  a laugh. The two crab cakes were mostly crab and I will give you that but they were 1/2 the size of my fist along with the mushy side vegetables.To top it off everything was cold. We also ordered fish tacos and they were ok and still pretty warm but the guacamole that came on the side was brown meaning it was either old or someone forgot lime juice I had sweet potato fries on the side and they were really cold much colder than the tacos. My mom ordered a salad with an add on of Ahi Tuna she had no c/o anything being wrong. I could keep going but I think this says enough."}
{"text":"Wow. Did a late Sunday lunch,  all our food great.  Prices very reasonable. Sundays do  breakfast offerings until 3 pm. Tasty, nicely presented good food. My burger cooked to order! Other orders, also wonderful. Great menu check it out.
 Especially liked the service. Jennifer, our server was  so good, knew the menu, answered our questions regarding food & drinks. Always handy as needed but not intrusive. Nice to go to a place w/ good, good food and have a delicious lunch without a server interrupting every 2 minutes ..need water, tea...  duh,  in so many places difficult to carry on any conversation b/c  servers are trying to help but instead are a constant  interruption to a private  or business conversation. Good staff, great food."}
{"text":"Very good.. the meals were definitely worth the money... a coworker and i went here after work for dinner and were not disappointed! The service was great and food came out in a timely manner... over all experience was quite pleasant"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday Brunch on Easter Sunday 4/1/2018.  These guys did a tremendous job.  We have a dairy allergy in the family and they were very accommodating.  With simply explaining our issue and our daughters requirements the waitress took it upon her self to talk to the chef and have her own scrambled eggs made separately.  We also asked about deserts and the waitress and chef worked together to promptly whip something up.  In general the staff were overly friendly even on the busiest of weekends (Easter Sunday).  I would highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner and ESPECIALLY Sunday Brunch.

If I had a negative the area where they have the buffet was tight.  It was very crowded for people to get to the food and/of when some of the food ran out it was difficult for people to get out of the way of the waitress/cooks to get the new food in there.  It is a tight quarter and I'm not sure what they can/would do to help this - they probably are doing the best the can with the space they have - but this would be my only recommendation for improving the place."}
{"text":"Excellent food but our server was terrible. Saw her three times to order. Never checked on us and everyone else who worked here brought out food and checked on us. Great fruit and cheese plate! Ahi tuna tacos awesome!!"}
{"text":"I honestly really like Walnut Grill. We just had a pretty terrible experience.

Five of us co workers came for lunch. My colleague and I picked the restaurant because we have never had a bad experience and the food is pretty good.

However, this day was pretty terrible. We were seated fairly quickly so that was good. We had a table in the large eating area. It was not crowded at all. 

We sit down and our server comes over and takes our drinks. She comes back with our drink orders then we order food. We waited for about an hour to get our food. No one came to check on us until about 5 minutes before the food came out. It appeared there might have been a problem in the kitchen but no one came out to let us know.

Our food came finally came out and it was just alright. We were not offered an explanation as to what happen or an apology. Honestly I will not be coming back to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here!!! I got the lobster Mac n cheese it was very good and to my surprise it came with two crispy pieces of bread to dip in! I was super excited about that. My bf got a RueBen, fries, and a side of French onion soup. He said it tasted good but nothing out of this world or anything. I have had their parmesan crusted chicken and sirloin in the past and I have never had a bad experience here! I will say it's a little over priced, but it's good."}
{"text":"I am a fan of walnut grill. The former mt Lebanon location was great - used to go there weekly. The Bridgeville location is good - DJ is great. The Robinson location has an awesome staff and is about 10 minutes from my house so I come here often. 

This review for the Robinson location specifically. The bartenders are always awesome.  They have a great drink selection and multiple t.v.'s so it's always a go to spot to grab some drinks.  I have had a few issues in the past waiting forever to get my food.  Also, on 2 occasions, I was there when it was cold outside and it was freezing inside as well.  The menu has a little bit of everything and I'm never disappointed with the food....it's always a little above average and consistent. 

My only real issue with this location is the one manager (bald gentleman) was very unfriendly to my wife and I one time and then very rude and condescending to my wife another time. The owner of walnut grill ended up being apologetic and very friendly though so I'm not going to give a bad rating over one guy. 

Overall, solid neighborhood bar / restaurant...very friendly bartenders...good food...really good drinks...very nice owners."}
{"text":"When we arrived at Walnut  Grill our waitress informed us it was still Happy Hour. So we hurried up and ordered. Our waitress was wonderful. She Helped with Gluten Free items and a menu. The food was great I ordered Blacken Salmon BLT it was awesome.  I liked the atmosphere and felt it was a great place to socialize."}
{"text":"Good service.  Had Erica's Frojito which was very good (even if my husband said it looks like a drinkable salad) if you're a mojito fan. Ahi Tuna appetizer could use a little more pizzazz for my taste buds. Carmelized walnut salad was ok.  Hubby's pasta dish was very good.  Can't remember what it was called but I think it was a new item. The beef in it was very tender."}
{"text":"Great lunch offerings and ambiance. Split \"Pick a Pair\", Seared Tuna Tacos and Caramelized Walnut Salad, along with Parmesan Crusted Chicken & Gnocchi. Perfect amount of food for two people. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Walnut Grill In robinson three times. I was giving them the benefit of multiple visits. Never again! Today was the last straw. We waited to be seated and then waited for the server to take our drink order. My husband ordered coffee and I had iced tea. She brought them but forgot the cream. We never saw her again. We waited for ten minutes and left. I could understand if they were busy but there was maybe one or two tables and they weren't there when we came in. We walked out and will never go back again!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and I don't know why all the negative reviews. Yes, they are a little pricey, but their service was great (thanks Mary and Elysse!), and the food I ordered (Pork Osso Buco w/House slaw), was great. I would definitely eat here again. I did have a 10 of 60 coupon to try this place. It is way better than Stone Peppers was, that place was awful!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious! The atmosphere is nice and relaxing. The drinks are on point!!! Waitress was very attentive and timely...even the Mgr stopped by to ensure we were satisfied! I will definitely return on my next visit to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Love this place...great menu selections with just enough variety. Have been there four times so far and every time we have received great service! Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst restaurant experience I have had in many years.  We had a party of 7.  It took 1 hour for our food to arrive after we ordered and the restaurant was empty.  When the food arrived only 4 or 7 meals came.  3 of those were completely burnt (black).  I should have taken photos to post but I did not think about it until after they removed the meals.  It then took another 30 minutes for everything to be served.  The manager did comp the meal but I would rather pay for a meal that is good than to get a bad on for free.  We will never be back."}
{"text":"4 star because we only stopped here for dessert and a drink. Great service at outdoor bar! Clean area. Drink specials were awesome! ($4 Long Island, $3 corona) can't beat that on a Saturday night. Desserts were amazing! Checked out menu while we were here, will definitely be back for food!"}
{"text":"Like the others, this Walnut Grille is an ok place for a casual dinner. It is, however, remarkably unremarkable. It's a nice restaurant, but there is nothing unusual or special about the menu, wine list, or service. If you're shopping in the area it's a convenient place for dinner, but not a destination on its own. We like the app lobster mac and cheese as a entre, usually with a salad to start, and one of their fairy-priced Chardonnays to wash it down."}
{"text":"It's a Wednesday night and we decided to try this place for dinner.  When walking inside, we noticed that it is clean with a current decor.  The hostess was friendly and offered us a seat in the bar area or dining area.  We chose the dining area as it was a bit quieter and we wanted to be able to talk.  The place was about 80% full, but we managed to get a booth.

After perusing the menu, we noticed the appetizers and entrees were fairly pricey and since we had never tried this place, we opted for a couple of sandwiches for our first visit.  My hubby settled on the Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich with fries and I chose the Beer Battered Cod Sandwich with fries.

After we ordered it took about 20 minutes for the food to come out.  At first glance, the plates looked pretty good (picture posted of the fish sandwich).  However, upon further inspection, the food was lacking in a big way.

The fish on the sandwich was cooked well on the inside but the batter was far from crispy.  In fact, it was down right soggy.  So much so that when trying to cut through it with a fork, it seemed like rubber.

The shaved prime rib sandwich had more bread than steak. Ultimately, better than the old SteakUm's used to be, but nothing to be excited about.  Hubby said it was \"meh\".

The fries sort of tasted like they had been reheated and there was absolutely no salt to be found on them.

Our whole meal had an overwhelming lack of flavor.  Thank goodness for ketchup and tartar sauce.  

The service was good and our server was attentive and polite.  She refilled our drinks without being asked and brought the check in quick fashion when we were ready to leave.

The big bonus were the little bowl of mints on the way out.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have not posted a review in a while, but felt that I would because my experience was wonderful at this Walnut Grill.  I was there on Friday night for happy hour and Jim the bartender was so spectacular.  He was fun, engaging, and very attentive.  I will return to this location because of his fabulous service."}
{"text":"Had a wedding rehearsal dinner here on 5/4/17....We were running very late, but it didn't matter....Everyone was so gracious....Thank you Rich (and staff) for being so pleasant and accommodating!....and the food was tasty!"}
{"text":"Had Walnut Salad and Flat Bread...amazing.  Fi wished off with Banana Bread Split.  Happy Hour 5-7.  Amazing food.  Great service."}
{"text":"The new Walnut Grill in Robinson looks nice.

I went with a group during lunch.   I ordered the Beer Battered Cod fish sandwich and fries.    The sandwich was HUGE.    The sandwich was okay.   The food came out hot and was cooked correctly.

The batter was not as crispy as I would of liked it and lacked flavor (I love beer battered fish).    

The overall experience was good.   

Ambiance - Great - this could be a good place for happy hour in the future
Service - Great - the server did a nice job and was polite.
Food - Okay - cooked correctly but lacked some flavor I was looking for
Price - :-( - They have lunch specials.  Many of their items start over $10 (average $12-14).  I believe my bill was over $15"}
{"text":"Jim always makes the work day better with his service at the bar. One of my favorite places to go for lunch in Robinson."}
{"text":"Our waiter was amazing. The food not so much. We ordered the pulled pork street tacos and the flavors did not mesh well. My long Island iced tea was a joke. It came out almost clear and in no way tasted like a long island iced tea. They did remake it, but yet again I felt as if I were choking it down. My daughter enjoyed her kids meal at least."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. Had reservations, was seated immediately however NO one waited on us. After 15 minutes we left. 3 servers looked at us and nothing. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food. We ordered the Fried Brussel Sprouts. They were very tasty. A bit gummy but overall were quite good. The side salad portions were large and fresh. The Atlantic Cod dinner was not good at all. Quite over cooked. My Crispy Chicken BLT Wrap was pretty good. Very large portion. The fries were nice and crispy. The manager came over to ask how our meals were. She agreed that our fish was over cooked. She was apologetic and bought us a round of drinks. We were there on a beautiful summer Friday night yet the place was not crowded at all, which should have tipped us off. No complaints about the service. The ambiance is very nice. We're not sure if we will return. Overall bill with drinks for three was $120 including gratuity."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here at 8 on a Saturday, the service was horrible. We waited 30 minutes for a drink from the bar, which when asked came right out. The food was good but, the portions are small and over priced. Don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Right by my Gym! the walnut grill is a healthy alternative to the surrounding restaurants. I came here on a Sunday after working out, I am not the guy who goes to restaurants to get a salad exactly, but the salads here were A-OK, good amount of different fruits, nuts,cheese, and greens. I got a beat salad w/ shrimp, tasted like some quality ingredients were used to make it. 

I just wish I had more, the salads average like 13-17 dollars with meat, for that price I would hope to have some more salad is all- if a rating was just based on service, cleanliness, and taste I would say the walnut grill would be a 4 star. 

Definitely left a good impression, very clean place to eat- looks like it has a good variety of food, I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday afternoon, not too crowded but was sat in the most crowded section,  service was slow, flat bread was burnt to a crisp, french onion soup was good. Probably will never return as I am sure it will not be there in a year."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sometimes the service is a little slow even if they're not busy,which can be a little frustrating , but other than that LOVE IT! great food, great drinks and specials, really nice staff!"}
{"text":"Atrocious. Absolutely terrible. Would never come back.The only things that were mildly ok were the drinks and the fact that no one was actively rude. We had to go get our own menus, the food took about an hour to come out once we had the opportunity to even order (our waitress would disappear for half hours at a time before we even ordered and that was even before we got drink orders in which also took forever to get to us even though we saw them sitting at the bar.) The food didn't come out as it was described on the menu at all: I ordered the Ruben eggs Benedict which sounded interesting and delicious. It came out as a poor excuse for a meal, missing cheese and having an anemic amount of substance. It was mostly large pieces of bread and one single slice of corned beef on each piece that they probably bought for 12¢ at giant eagle next door. The \"dinner size\" of the orange chicken was laughable and by laughable I mean sad. It was $17 for two tiny pieces of chicken tenders covered in sugar basically. I don't feel bad writing this review. We used to go to the one in mt Lebanon and it was pretty good. But this location was a poor excuse for a restaurant. And they certainly did NOT deserve the $47 we paid for the awful service and food. Sorry but this place sucks."}
{"text":"I've known about Walnut Grill for a while now but it wasn't till a few months ago that I actually decided to go to the Wexford location. I wasn't blown away whatsoever so I thought for sure I would never return to any location . I had a sudden change of heart this past weekend and decided to give the Robinson location a try. 

Needless to say there was clearly a reason I said I didn't want to go back. The menu looks enticing with all of its options but the food is nothing special whatsoever. After much debating I decided to order a Bloody Mary with my brunch. I'm a Bloody Mary snob so I was very hesitant going into it until I saw what it looked like and it seemed like it could be half decent. Wrong again. It tasted like watered down Campbell's tomato soup. I couldn't even force it down it was so bad. As a Bloody Mary fanatic, it was a disgrace that they would even call that a Bloody Mary. 

Food wise I decided to go with the biscuits and gravy. I thought surely they would have to be good if my work cafeteria can manage to make good biscuits and gravy. Wrong again. It didn't event look appetizing. The gravy looked as if they decided to be cheap and replace some of the cream/milk with water. It just didn't even look right. The biscuits didn't taste fresh at all and the eggs were most definitely not poached. Having a runny egg doesn't make it poached. The egg white shouldn't be completely cooked and rubbery. 

With my recent experience it's safe to say I'm done giving any Walnut Grill a chance. If you enjoy good quality, homemade food I would not recommend it. The food doesn't taste fresh and at times doesn't even taste like they made it in-house."}
{"text":"Service was slow for an empty place . The GF's soup salad combo was good , the Pittsburgh steak salad was a joke For $17 , you can get a better salad from your local pizza shop . I paid an extra $7 for tips and I got like 2oz of meat ! Probably wouldn't come back . Unless I was just Drinking I wonder how long it would take to get a beer"}
{"text":"Gave WG another chance due to a gift certificate from a horrible experience at another WG. Well I should have declined. The price and quality do not match. The prices are Morton's but the food is Eat and Park. The pumpkin ravioli was flavorless and room temp. The side salad greens were limp and lacking any pizzaz. The beer menu was decent enough but after three chances on food and three really disappointing experiences I'll take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We just came for appetizers and drinks. Great service and great live music.  We both loved the apps drinks music and service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is a convenient place for a happy hour drink and snacks or a lunch date with a friend. They have good drink specials every day of the week (I personally favor Mojito Monday) and they always have a good selection of beer on tap. The service is generally pretty good, and the staff is friendly. They have some creative salads (I like the Strawberry Balsamico, add salmon), but they can be pricey if you get one that doesn't come with a protein and decide to add on. I haven't had anything bad here, but also nothing extraordinary. I would recommend if you aren't looking for a food experience, but just want a reliable place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Good craft beer list, another awesome set up, not too far from the city. The food was good too! Will be going again to get full meal as we only got appetizers"}
{"text":"We were on our way to PF Chang when we noticed walnut grill, I never heard of it apparently there are four or five others so we tried it, we were very satisfied with our food and that consisted of the stuffed banana peppers a cheeseburger fish tacos grilled veggies and loaded tater tot's. Food was very good service was very good atmosphere was a good first time I was ever there and I have no complaints definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I ate there with my Mother on a Wednesday evening. Wasn't too busy, drinks were awesome, our food was prompt and very good. Our waitress was personable and the manager came around to each table to ensure everything was acceptable. I'll be recommending to the boss for happy hour and lunches. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to this new Walnut Grill, formerly Stone Pepper location.  Have enjoyed some happy hours drinks and appetizers at some other WG's but we stopped in for a meal.  My Blackened Salmon BLT was OK, the bacon was tasty but the fish was not real good or fresh.  The sweet potato fries were large slices of potato and OK.  We sat in the bar area and it was busy and looks like it will be a typical WG.  There are about 30 beers on tap."}
{"text":"Daughter and I went here the other night for diner.
We both had the special which was filet mignon and a baked potato and french onion soup.
The filet was delicious and the french onion soup was among the best I have ever had.
The service was super fast and waitress was really friendly.
The price for two of us with drinks and tip was like $42 a bargain for such a delicious meal.
If I am ever in that area again I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Three stars is all this place is going to get from me. This was my second attempt at liking this Walnut Grill, and honestly it will likely be my last visit.

The server greeted us and was friendly and attentive enough, but decided it would be a good idea to start with telling us how he was recovering from a hangover. Cool.

This place could be so much more. Good menu, nice drink selection, etc. But it was EMPTY when we were there and the food was simply okay. Soup was a little too salty, cheese on my sandwich wasn't melted, table was sticky. Just a lot of misses.

My husband said it best. They need to decide if they are five stars or two. They are not the only option in the area. The decor says \"hip, kinda swanky, upscale bar but not too fancy\". The food and service say Applebees. Just confusing."}
{"text":"I have always loved the food at Walnut Grill. The atmosphere, drinks, and food are all very good. I didn't have an issue with the restaurant until the last time I went. My boyfriend and I really wanted to sit outside because of great weather, and we were excited because usually the outside tables are full, but there about 8 tables empty. However, when we asked to sit outside, the hostess said that there was nothing available. I understand if they were short-staffed, but there was no explanation after we asked why we could not be seated outside. We then proceeded to basically be ignored once we were seated inside, and we almost missed the movie we were going to after dinner. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for good food and drink, but I would also caution you to get there early enough if you have plans after!"}
{"text":"Service subpar and food mediocre. Good happy hour and super convenient location which is honestly why we continue to return. Recently they've implemented a button to get a waiter -I hate it.  Call me old fashioned but I don't want to hit a button when my drink is empty. Please service my table and refill/clear things as appropriate. I found that the button replaced actual service and if we didn't hit it we weren't looked at."}
{"text":"Based on several visits. Sunday brunch, drinks and apps and meals. Good service and food. No complaints. Enjoyed the loaded tater tots appetizer with the melted cheese sauce & candied jalapeños. The wings were very good. Have tried something different every time and have not been disappointed. Like the chili. Tried the pick 2 with the crab cake. Tasty!"}
{"text":"We had made a reservation several months ago for the patio for our family reunion kick off.  Although I had made the reservation for 6:30, when I called to confirm I was told it was for 6 pm.  Since those who were attending were getting into town early, this time worked.  Upon arrival, I was surprised that the tables were set up separately.  When I asked to have them put together so we can all be together to engage in family conversation, it was reluctantly done. Not sure what the issue was that made it so difficult to accommodate.  Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, the waitress forgot to put in 2 of the 15 orders.  Both orders were comped for their error, but that wasn't the point.  The food that was delivered was very good."}
{"text":"Went to walnut with a friend before going to a movie. Waited almost 20 min for our waters (wine took longer), told waitress we only had an hour before the movie, food came out with 10 minutes to spare. Good food, horrible service and wait time, no one comes to check on you"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy the food at this particular Walnut Gill. However, this was the second time we have come in on a Sunday and had terrible service. The first was a few weeks ago for bunch and then today for dinner. No idea where our waitress ran off to. She was very pleasant and friendly but did not check on us for refills or to see how our food was during the visit. We love the food here but may just order takeout or come in on a different day."}
{"text":"This Walnut Grill location was absolutely terrible. The service and our appetizer started out great, however after that everything went down hill. Our waiter, although nice, came to our table about every 2 minutes and 30 seconds . He kindly explained to us that the kitchen had messed up and was remaking half of our parties meal and would be out very shortly. When I specifically got my food (buffalo chicken Flatbread which is what I normally get) all of the toppings, including the cheese, fell right off of the Flatbread. I should have taken pictures because as I came to find out, while the bread was cooked the cheese was not and there was about 7 pounds of Buffalo sauce on the meal. I do understand he had brought my food out literally seconds after it was done but if he would have explained to me that it was just pulled out and it would be a little longer, I would have been fine with that. 

To that note we waited a good 30 minutes for our actual meals to come out after the appetizer, which to me is unacceptable. It was also not even close to busy. 

Overall, this location was a pretty big flop. The Wexford location is much better in terms of overall service. More then likely will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Service was fine, not very crowded (we went during lunch). we had a party of ten with reservations yet they sat us at a high top which was not very comfortable or spacious. There were many other options they could have put us. Drinks and food came out pretty quickly, nothing really to complain about here. 

I got a shaved prime rib sandwich, mashed potatoes as a side and an order of tater tots. The tater tots were the best part by far. The mashed potatoes were pretty good and would order again. However, the sandwich was very disappointing. To start off with, I ordered it without mushrooms and peppers, and i swear they gave me extra peppers and mushrooms. Plus it was all cooked together so it was extremely difficult to simply pull them off. The beef was very bland and kinda lukewarm. The baguette it came on was pretty good. There was no au jus sauce to dip it in which was a little disappointing. 

I would go back, simply because I have heard many good things and I would give it another shot, but overall, it was very \"meh\""}
{"text":"The salads we got prior to our main dish were fantastic. They were better than the main dish itself. I ordered the mixed grill with three types of protein and they were all bland in taste. They were grilled nicely but just lacked flavor. I may just go back for those salads!!"}
