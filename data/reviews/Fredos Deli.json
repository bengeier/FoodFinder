{"text":"The food is excellent.  Make certain to try the chicken salad and the tuna salad, all homemade and delicious!  Really nice owners!  The wraps are fantastic and not soggy!"}
{"text":"I have the distinct privilege of being able to work on Potomac Avenue in Dormont. There are so many great places to eat in Dormont, but Freido's continues to be my favorite. My meal is always ready quickly when I order takeout, and I have yet to be disappointed. By far my favorite menu item is the steak, ranch, and french fry toasted sub! Amazing! I'm also a fan of the wraps."}
{"text":"I had been ordering about once a week for a few months for lunch and was very happy with the service and food. Prices are reasonable and food quality better than average. 

Last week I found a hair in my salad which I understand will happen but of course I did not eat it. I called a week later to place an order and informed them of the hair and was only asking for a replacement salad for the one I had to toss. I was then informed that there was nothing that could be done because I did not call immediately and prove the hair was there.

Its not a free salad issue to me , just principal. I had spent hundreds of dollars there and was clearly just looking for some customer service. Just a warning that if you find something in your food drop everything you are doing and call immediately or they will not help you.

I will personally not be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Just recently moved from Ohio to Dormont. Couldn't believe there was a Bosnian restaurant right down the street from me. They are super friendly and remembered my name after only one visit. I always get the large cevape."}
{"text":"Fredo's has great food. What I like most about them is they deliver. The godfather hoagie is delicious and well as the tomato florentine soup. The bread on the sandwiches is always fresh. My boyfriend ordered a gyro once and didn't care for it. Wings are also good! I would recommend Fredo's deli."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found Fredo's as a delivery option of something other than pizza and Chinese to my house.

$15 minimum for free delivery via Grubhub, which would amount to a huge lunch for one, or a couple of sandwiches. 

I was able to try the Rachel and the Italian. For $8 a pop the Rachel was quite small and tasted unimpressive... I didn't really like the corned beef they used. :(  The Italian, on the other hand, was much more substantial for the same price and had a delicious balance of meats and toppings; my only complaint is that the bread was a bit too hard to chew. 

3.5 - gotta take off a bit for being overpriced for the portion and quality, but i'm still very glad to have it as an option!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived in Dormont for almost 4 years and have been going to Fredo's fairly regularly for awhile.  All of their sandwiches and wraps are quite good.  It was only until recently, however, that we tried their Bosnian food.  It was pretty amazing, especially the bread.  We had a Cevapi and also the pljeskavica.  The Cevapi is lamb and beef sausage links on homemade bread and the pljeskavica is kind of like a hamburger with the same beef and lamb mix on the same bread.  Both excellent, the bread is kind of like a pillowy focaccia. The only thing I've had that wasn't well above average was the Gyro.  It's frozen gyro meat not off the spit.  It was still OK but not great.  The chicken gyro is better.  They also have regular coffee, lattes and espresso, as well as Turkish coffee.  They have a great breakfast too.  The owners have always been very friendly and very supportive of the neighborhood.  There's also a big back room that could probably hold around 50 people.  They have free Wi-Fi and allow BYOB.   Definitely worth checking out, especially if you live in the area."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: great deli serving up variety of foods. Fresh ingredients, great service. 

I wish I'd come here sooner. It's a small family-owned business and they have such a varied menu; they don't just have your run of the mill deli sandwiches. They have wings, gyros, cevapi and much more! The cevapi are amazing and you can't seem to find it at many places in Pittsburgh, not that I know of anyway. Cevapi are little beef and veal sausages served on homemade pita-like bread, with raw onions and some sort of red pepper sauce. The breads is perfectly crispy yet soft and fluffy, and also a bit chewy and buttery. PERFECTION. The sausages are juicy and the onions add a nice zing. I've also tried the gyro and the ingredients were so fresh! Fredos also has an assortment of grocery items that you usually can't find anywhere else. I will definitely be back if not for the cevapi, then definitely to try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"(9/9/2014) We needed an easy meal before a show at the Hollywood Theater and stopped in at Fredo's right next door. I wouldn't necessarily call it quick, but I thought it was worth the time spent, wish we were a little more relaxed. They have paninis, cold sandwiches, but the specialties are Bosnian street food. Never had it before, tried the Small Cevapi, 5 homemade beef and veal links on fresh lepinje (soft round bread). Sausages were like an Eastern European descendant of kefta or ground meat kebabs that can be found all over the former Ottoman Empire. The bread was soft and pillowy, lots of large bubbles in the yeast risen dough, slightly springy and chewy, great for soaking up the juices from the sausages topped with ajvar (roasted red pepper spread with mild heat, slight bitterness) and raw diced white onion. My friend had the Gyro, looked basic, lots of fresh shredded romaine and a rich tzatziki sauce. A side order of grape leaves were fine, but I suspect from canned. Def some good cheap eats, place is cozy, filled with dry goods, soft drinks, and candies from the Balkans.  Service was friendly and homey, looked like many locals and possibly some family members hanging out there."}
{"text":"Fredo's does do a great job of portraying a family deli in the heart of Dormont. I've tried a few of their sandwiches and have to say that my go-to favorite has to be the Italian. IT\"S AWESOME!!

I like to go in and see all the authentic candy, drinks, whatever kind of stuff they have on the shelves that are in labeled in languages I can't pronounce. It's also an added benefit that the employees talk to each other in a foreign language. 

Nothing is cooler than going to a place and hearing the workers yell at each other in a foreign language. Are they talking about you? Are they talking about the food? Who knows...? It's all mysterious, and it adds to the excitement of getting your food. 

I always polish my sandwiches down with an ice cold Fanta or Orange soda. I suggest you do the same yo.."}
{"text":"Food was good for half of the people who ordered. Overdone chicken tenders, not good fries, but nothing compares to having the delivery driver yell at you and have the restaurant brush aside your concerns. This was for a $150 order. The driver got lost due to a Grubhub error and called in an angry voice to say he was lost. Directions were given promptly and when he arrived he yelled at me when I opened the door. The restaurant was called and no apology was given. Customer service at its finest."}
{"text":"Such a great little spot! Homemade soup of the day (tomato florentine) was AMAZING! Salads were generous and freshly made. The restaurant has a European feel. We loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's right across the street from where I work.  The food is great and the family that runs it is even better.  Grilled Italiano Panini is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff! The Cevapi are to die for!!! I go here everytime I'm home with my family. It's right in the heart of dormont and right next to the Hollywood theater which is super convenient when you want a good meal right before a show"}
{"text":"Triple decker was a decent sandwich and part of a large deliver order.  However the driver did not have the correct address and drove around for 20 minutes before calling.... Hello?  Use your phone and call after a few minutes.  So driver finally gets here and then yells at us, yes literally yells at us.  We may or may not gave the correct address upon ordering, but i doubt we messed up our own address, we have lived at this residence for a number of years.  But why be rude and yell at us.  A few other people made comments about there food being mediocre, maybe it from the driver not calling and riding around for 20 minutes before calling and then yelling at us leaving us with cold sandwiches that should have been hot."}
{"text":"What fun find in Dormont! My husband and I moved from Texas and I LOVE finding little caf√©s and delis to try. I'm not disappointed. Fredo's has a decent sized menu and the lady behind the counter an enchanting accent. I like a good Reuben but was torn between it and an Italiano panini...she suggested the panini and I'm glad I took her advice. It smells delicious, the bread is homemade and all the meats are fantastic. Can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I get the cevape all the time and whatever desserts they have available. They are very friendly everytime I come here. You can pick up or get delivery."}
{"text":"This place changed my (foodie) life! Before moving to Dormont, I had not exposed myself to much Greek or Mediterranean food. Shortly after moving here, my boyfriend and I stopped here after passing it every morning on or way to the Potomac T Station. I figured I'd try out the grape leaves because I have always wanted to try this Mediterranean staple. All I can say is WOW. The grape leaves are served cold with slices of lemon to squeeze over them. We also have tried the gyros (chicken and lamb) and they were excellent as well (wish the tzatziki sauce was a little more flavorful). Try the grape leaves here - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am changing the rating for the mere fact that the owner puts magic in her food! I lovve everything I have tried so far! The meat ball hoagie is filling even at 6\"! Everything is homemade. The steak for the sandwiches and salads are marinated in her special marinate, then fried. So delish! This place never disappoints me and my family. Keep doing a good job!!"}
{"text":"I would go out on a limb and say I've had the best hoagie in Pittsburgh here. Buff chix was good + the prices."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews I was excited to try this place. We had our food delivered so my expectations were a little lower, but what we got was terrible. My fianc√© got the Ruben and while I don't expect piping hot food it was so cold it seemed to have come from a fridge. I ordered the gyro and it was terrible. The pita was stale, the lettuce wilted, and I didn't end up putting the sauce on it because it smelled spoiled. We ordered baklava and not even that tasted good; it was so soggy and mushy that neither of us could stomach eating it. I am really disappointed because the reviews were so strong. We will consider trying this place again but if we do we will be dinning in."}
{"text":"What a bummer! I was excited to try this joint bc it's so close to my house, seems unique, and has received some great reviews. I ordered delivery, which was pretty fast. The BBQ wings were ok, a little too well done even for me. I asked for celery & ranch on the side, but I guess they don't have celery bc it wasn't included in the order. The ranch was in a small dressing ramekin that was an extra $1.00. I also ordered the steak hoagie, which was totally beat. The steak was flavorless and dry, and the bread wasn't even toasted. Like, it didn't seem to be baked in an oven at all, which I found weird. I ordered a 2 liter of sprite also, but they brought ginger ale instead.... Which was actually ok bc I like that more. Not sure I'll try again...."}
{"text":"The corned beef Rachel I had was very good.  We also ordered macaroni salad which tasted similar to store brand which I wasn't fond of.  My son had wings and he said they were good and they must've been because he had the BBQ sauce all over his face and hands.  The soup of the day was okay but not something I would order again.  I did think it was a bit pricey for what we ordered."}
{"text":"One recent Sunday afternoon, Kay and I decided to have a bit of the Balkans delivered to our porch. 

Cevapi is a sandwich that utilizes somun, a cross between pita and flatbread. Inside the pocket are placed 5-10 (small or large) small sausages made of a beef and veal blend. The somun was doughy and hearty while the breakfast-worthy grilled sausages were a blackened a tad on the outside to form a searing crust that held the savory, brackish juices within. Diced onions added crunch and heat while ajvar, a condiment made of pureed garlic and roasted red bell pepper, acted as a particularly rich, sweet ketchup. 

Another exotic delicacy sampled was a dessert called Hurmashica on the menu. Arriving at a crossroads between golab jamun, a scone, a cornmeal biscuit, baklava, and a sugar cookie, the somewhat chewy, rectangular treat was coated with coconut and laden with honey that somehow didn't cause it to be too saccharine. 

Of course, Fredo's also offers the usual wings, appetizers, panini, gyros, salads, and the like, but no pizza, surprisingly. For a more conventional deli item, one would do well to follow my lead and order the Godfather. An absolute boss of a grinder, Sopressata, Genoa Salami, provolone, olive oil, oregano, and roasted red peppers can all be found within a flaky baguette that could very well be served warm with butter and pasta. Piquant, aromatic, meaty. Veni, vidi, vici...

Terrific chocolate chips cookies were also had, but whether or not they are made in-house remains a mystery, which brings me back to that potato salad I wrote of 4 1/2 years ago. 

It's so intensely creamy, if it ain't Grandma's brand, they must be using half & half in the dressing, which isn't a bad thing. I think I liked it a smidge more than I did when last I ate it, but I'm still wondering if it isn't just a jazzed up storebought one. I hope I'm wrong and am skeered to ask. 

Anyway, don't be skeered to call up Fredo's for a wonderful lunch or dinner shuttled over to your place of employment or residence. They're doing something different in Dormont, and that alone is reason enough to give to their cause."}
{"text":"Ok, not a place you would just go to unless you are in the hood or want to try some Croation food.  Some of the Croatian food is a must try!
Stopped by with a friend who loves Fredo's and I have been wanting to stop by and get a Cevapi.  
The deli is brightly painted with a darker red ceiling and border and yellow walls.
My Cevapi was served on a house made bread, with onion and a red pepper spread (Ajvar, spelling is a guess). The bread is moist and tasty, really good, the Ajvar is a little sweet and very good, and the sausage are a combo of beef and veal were OK but I would prefer a little more flavor, the Ajvar and onions were a nice combo.  I understand that they do have a spicer sausage, next time."}
