{"text":"Wow, I lived in Japan for 3 years and this place is amazing. Fresh, tender sushi that melts in your mouth. Portions are HUGE. They literally pack the bowl full of your chosen ingredients. Staff is nice and helpful with choosing ingredients to compliment your meal. 3 large scoops of proteins only cost $10.45. Amazing deal. Highly recommend for a sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Great food alternative to the buffet offerings in the casinos. Cleaning up after customers may need to be improved. When I came in, there was table that messy and customer didn't have the decency to pick up his or her napkin."}
{"text":"The sushi bowl was so flavorful. A little confusing ordering but the ladies were helpful through the process. Next time I will try the soup."}
{"text":"Not as big of a menu as some other sushi burrito places but food was delicious. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Very happy to have them in this part of town and will be eating here often!"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place out. I ordered for pick up and ordered 2 ninja crunch. I also ordered a side of miso soup. Then the lady informed that my order came with the soup already. I was super impressed! You get a bang with your buck!  I was super satisfied , I came back again the next when I got off work. Again, it was super delicious!"}
{"text":"In an area dominated by Poke Bars and such this place is amongst the better ones I had.  They have unique custom roles along a create your own option. While very busy during my visit them seemed disorganized and it resulted in my order being incorrect where they missed adding Tuna to the Poke Nachos I ordered...kind of the main component to the dish.  The burrito I got itself was very good tho so based off that when in the area I'll return....but will double check the order before I leave"}
{"text":"Walk in, kid was on his cell phone sitting, gets up, no hand washing, puts gloves on and stares. I say HI.. nothing. He asks what rice, I tell him, he grabs 2 bowls and throws it on the counter. I'm sorry but I cant deal with service like that. I said nevermind especially bot with service like that. If you're having a bad day, or hate your job, do something else. Not sure what just happened. I dont even write reviews.. explains why it was empty."}
{"text":"There's not much that differentiates one poke place from another, but as long as they keep cropping up around town, I'll keep going. This location in North Las Vegas is close to my office, so I can see a lot more visits in my future!  For this first trip, I got three scoops of protein (ahi, salmon, and baked eel) on mixed greens ($10.45). Next time I think I'll double up on the eel and skip the salmon, although all three fish were good. Plenty of options for toppings; I chose cucumbers, kale, edamame, green onions, and seaweed salad. The special sauce was not too sweet, and the seaweed salad was nicely seasoned. You can order burritos, too, but I think I'll stick with the bowls, with greens instead of rice to lower the carb count.  The name lends itself to lots of juvenile humor, but don't let that stop you from stopping in if you're in the neighborhood and you're a poke fan like me!"}
{"text":"Good portions on bowls and burritos Good customer service And good prices ..good all around check em out"}
{"text":"Tastes good, but the portion of protein was very small, I felt like the whole bowl was rice. The pieces were also cut wayyy too small. I asked for sauce on the side and they forgot it. Hopefully next time I pick up food the portions are bigger and it's tastier WITH the sauce."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The ingredient are fresh  and the burritos are a great portion. I'm so glad this place opened close to me. They have a special burrito miso soup and drink for $11. Will return!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pokè! Fresh and perfect in all ways. I had the Lava Tuna and I would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi this place is the bomb! I have you here more than three times and I can tell you I like the customization from the employees who make the balls and their food is absolutely delicious! The food comes the other in a bowl or a roll whoever thought of this place was a genius so good highly recommend this place!  Every time over 10 visits always the same as above! Good attentive help and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Dam this ish is fireee if you like poke or sushi its a must go let me tell you. I had it for THE first time its killer i got the number one bowl style  sub brown rice it tasted like a sushi roll in a bowl bomb.com i already want to go back and try more of this place they also offer build your own bowls or burrito style they use seaweed wrap instead of tortilla looked taste worthy"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places to eat for lunch.  I even have my family hooked.  Since we are avoiding over eating and not visiting all you can eat sushi places, this is the next best thing  at $10pp.  You can choose their signature poke burritos (salad or rice bowl options) or create your own.  I usally creat my own addding all the toppings I like.  It is a healthier option to 5Guys and Pieology and I acutally, perfer Sushitto over anything in the complex.  The staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"So glad to have a poke restaurant in NLV. My first time to dine at Poke Sushitto   I picked the 3 proteins bowl with half sushi rice and brown rice.  I have been to other Poke restaurants and majority of them do not offer sushi rice so this was a pleasant surprise.  For my proteins, I got ahi tuna, octopus and shrimp tempura.  For vegetables  I had seaweed salad, cucumbers, crab, edamame, jalapeños, corn and mango topped with srirachi sauce.  Everything was fresh and delicious. Will be coming back. Also, they are offering free drink and miso soup with your Poke purchase."}
{"text":"Literally the BEST POKE spot IN VEGAS !!! I hope they keep up the good work ! My hubby and I we're out there for a whole 2 weeks and could NOT stop eating at the place .. so Good ! Great service and most importantly COMPLETELY FRESH !!! thanks Poke Sushitto we will miss you"}
{"text":"Delicious! Glad I went! I got a bowl with one scoop salmon, and one scoop tuna. They didn't have many other selections for fish, just the most popular."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. It's a really cute concept for diy poke bowls, they have a lot of options to really customize your order"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the new age type of sushi... whether you get the burrito or bowl, you won't be dissatisfied. If you love  you will love this new age sushi..."}
{"text":"This is so original and amazing . Healthy lunch . Loved it. I plan on bringing more people Back. So glad I yelped sushi and found this"}
{"text":"Went here and literally pigged out on delicious fresh sashimi and left so full and happy. I highly recommend this place to everyone who loves sushi. It's one of the best around."}
{"text":"I love this place . The girls was so welcoming and told me some suggestions. The price is amazing and cheap . Make sure you get a hibiscus tea as well"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Very fresh seafood and a wide selection of toppings! Hope to come back too."}
{"text":"Super excited this place is so close to my house. I had the build your own bowl. For the price you pay, you get a lot for it. I love the different add on options they had. Unlimited add ons. Definitely my new place!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! I've gone a couple times. Parking is easy, Avoid going around 12-1 it gets very busy with military people on break. Salmon is good, not the best but good!"}
{"text":"Poke is not my forte, but lunch here was excellent! Went at the urging of a friend and thoroughly enjoyed a salmon/tuna bowl over brown rice.   The restaurant layout will be familiar for folks that frequent chipotle, blaze, or other quick service joints."}
{"text":"I looked on Yelp to find a sushi place and this place popped up. It was my first time there so I was pretty excited. I enjoy a good Poke selection. Fast forward to my experience. I walked in and said Hello, no-one said Hi, there were two employees. The guy that was about to assist got up and stood there while putting on his gloves, he did not say a word. I was reading the menu and trying to decide on a bowl or a burrito, he continued to stand there, not even offering any assistance, or at least a friendly gesture. I asked for a burrito bowl, he took the bowl out and said, \"white or brown rice\" (his tone was uncalled for). I decided at that point, as much as I love me some seafood, I would rather eat at Pieology next door. The customer service is lacking 100%. Hopefully the next person that decides to try this place out for their FIRST time, gets a better experience. I know I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"**Love this place!!   Quite and small place sandwiched in between Five Guys and Pieology with quick service and good fish.   I haven't found the kale salad at any other \"sushi burrito spot\" and it makes the difference for me. I go for that and the open late hours (9:30pm).  There is an awesome cream melon soda and a few other Asian drinks/treats. However, I wish is they served more fun Asian snacks that other places offer."}
{"text":"First time trying a sushi bowl; didn't know what to expect. It was delicious. It's set up like chipotle but with sushi. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We were gonna eat at L&L Hawaiian right next to it, but one of my sister made us try her sushi burrito, so we all changed our minds and went here.   Reminds me of Subway, they make your sushi burrito, you tell em what you want in it, what sauce etc... first time here and we loved our sushi burritos! Definitely will come here again! It's like sushi rolls but bigger! Don't forget to check in via yelp for some free miso soup and soda!"}
{"text":"The portion was not as much as I thought it was as advertised.  The flavor was good and mixed well. I like Hawaiian poke which they don't have.  Bigger chunks of protein. I gave it 4out of 5 because of the portion for the price you pay. Service was good and fast. Location was a space oddities in its self.  2wks from everywhere. Just kidding."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service/portions/prices were underwhelming. Instead of asking if it was my first time or if I needed any help with the menu, they stared awkwardly until I was ready to order.  If you usually order bowls, you might be disappointed by their portions. It's about 1/3 the size of SOHO's and Sweet Poke's bowls.   $9.50 for a sushi bowl is pretty standard, but not for this size. It's such a small serving compared to most places.  Overall would only recommend if you're reaaally craving it and don't wanna drive too far for better options."}
{"text":"This is the best poke I have had. They have a good selection of toppings and everything tasted fresh. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Actually deserves -0- ZERO NADDA!! when it comes to serving or making orders.  First time going here since ratings looked so inviting. BUT WAS FOOLED!! NEVER AGAIN!!! the person taking our orders started off with tossing bowl on counter with a tone of voice as if we were forcing him to make us a bowl, which we did what was right, said forget it and walked out!!   NOT sure of everyone's ratings but, this kind of service is totally unacceptable.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR JOB QUIT!!! DON'T LET OTHERS FEEL AS IF THEIR PATRONAGE ISN'T WORTH YOUR TIME!!!   IF YOU ARE HAVING A BAD EVENING!! GO HOME OR SUCK IT UP AND TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS RIGHT!!!"}
{"text":"First try at a sushi burrito. Fun concept but it gets a bit messy. Maybe I dont know how to eat it, but it got everywhere in the end.  I'd still come back here for a regular bowl tho. Everything in the burrito tasted great so I'd assume the bowls are tastey."}
{"text":"The burritos are decent. Customer service is terrible. You can tell the employees hate their job and could care less if you buy anything at all."}
{"text":"The location is new and you can tell the employees are finding their rhythm. However, the service was efficient, and the employees were helpful. If you've ever been to other Poke stops, the format is the same; with the open bar as you get to watch them pile on your food. From what I ordered, specifically (a bowl with many fixings but mainly ahi tuna), they're very generous. The burrito (a large sushi roll) looked interesting enough. I'll definitely try the sushi burrito on another day with an empty stomach. Overall, the food was fresh and tasty; filling, and I ended up spending about $20 and some change (two poke bowls). I was also given two, small complimentary miso soup bowls with the meals I ordered. Additionally, the environment is small, clean and neat looking. Will go again when I'm craving this particular type of food!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  This is my first time trying a poke bowl and was very happy I stopped by. It's a smaller restaurant but perfect for a quick lunch, dinner or even a snack!  Everything was clean, the employees were very friendly and helped me navigate my way on my first experience.  Very helpful!   I ended up getting the two protein (shrimp and shrimp tempura) poke bowl with their signature sauce topped with crab and some spicy sauce and some veggies.  My daughter got the kids sushirrito that had shrimp tempura, crab and teriyaki sauce wrapped in seaweed paper.  We also got miso soup, edamame, and some drinks.    Overall a great experience with great food!  Will recommend.  Thanks again. Happy and full customer"}
{"text":"First timing having a sushi burrito and it was everything I expected..Delicious!!! I tried their Ninja."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! We now have a new favorite place when driving thru town to stop. Fish was fresh. They had it for us since we didn't know what to put in the burritos and they turned out amazing! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great options for vegetarians and non-vegetarian alike. It was my first time here and the staff were extremely patient with me. Great tasting sauces and lots of interesting options."}
{"text":"This was my first time being here and not only is the food great but the service was awesome! these girls are super nice and they are quick  too."}
{"text":"let me explain my complaint: they do military discount for active duty only.  so some snot nosed kid who's only served a few months gets a discount while a 20 plus year veteran doesn't.  I mean if that's fair to you, that's cool. Just a little perspective and something to think about Sushitto"}
{"text":"This restaurant came out of nowhere and got me hooked on the first visit. I've only had the sushi bowl and burrito and I'm completely content with sticking with those two options. I bought 3 of my other coworkers and they also fell in love. Complementary soup for eating in is very nice, and the mocchi ice cream is to die for.   Lovely place great food if not a bit expensive.   Update: the last two visits here haven't been very good. The first four or five times I ate there during the day were all great, but these recent visits in the evening weren't as good. The tuna wasn't properly cleaned, and I've had two reactions to it: the first being a swollen mouth, and the next a minor case of hives, both of which I had to get antibiotics for. Due to these incidents I don't think I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, the crunchy ninja was delicious definitely would go back. They give you miso soup if you choose one of their burritos/bowls from the menu, you can also make your own like in most other places. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"First time and I absolutely LOVE it!!! The food was really flavorful especially with the siriacha. It was my first time trying seaweed salad  and I got to say, it taste way better than what it looks like. The staff was friendly and followed my special request to put extra sauce in my sushi burrito. I'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Yeah! A Sushi Burrito place close by - love the decor but come and see for yourself- they got a lot to work on! But it's yum stuff!"}
{"text":"Week it Might not be SoHo but it's bomb! The staff is extremely nice and they have a huge variety. If you do 3 proteins you get a reward card after 10 one is free which I think is cool. Overall for being new to the north side this might be my new sushi burrito place"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today and I'm not gonna lie, I didn't feel very welcomed and the vibe I got in there was kind of awkward. I feel bad for saying that because there's a lot of good things being said about the customer service. Maybe it was just me?? I took a while to figure out what I wanted to order and I know my voice is soft so I apologize to the girl working for not being able to hear me or if I annoyed her for taking a while. She wasn't exactly rude but she seemed ticked off when I asked her to repeat some things because I wasn't able to hear her sometimes also. None of that will stop me from coming though :)  THE ACTUAL FOOD- it was great!! I made my own bowl- brown rice, ahi tuna, salmon, poke sauce, green onion, cilantro, and corn. I also used the check in for the miso soup and soda. I think my total was something around $10 which to me is a great price. I wanna come back soon. This place should have stamp cards or a rewards system lol"}
{"text":"I just had my 1st sushi burrito, and it did not disappoint. It was great, service wass quick and employees were more than helpful for this 1st timer with his fam. I recommend it, will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try a Sushitto (sushi in a burrito form). So when I found this place on yelp, I had to come and try it!  I ordered the ninja crunch, the size was about the same as a burrito at Chipotle. The Sushitto was great! It pretty much tasted like a California crunch. A simple idea but amazing! The Sushitto was big enough for me to split into two meals, one half for lunch and the other for dinner.   Don't forget to check in on Yelp! To get a free cup of soda and miso soup!  I'm giving them a four star review since the food is delicious but I want to come to try more food off their menu. If you haven't had Poke yet, you can compare it to the bowl from chipotle but with seafood! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Think of this like the Chipotle of Sushi places. The portion sizes are massive, food quality is pretty Dan good and the prices are outstanding. A sushi burrito for ~$10 that's made up of seaweed paper, sushi rice, several types of meat and then all the fixings of a specialty roll, all rolled together and eaten like a burrito. Absolutely amazing bang for the buck and would recommend this as a frequent lunch place, nearly fast food speed."}
{"text":"Place has nice environment. Star was friendly and urgent which is nice. They weren't as busy today but there were ppl inside. My poke was a little too wet which made my rice soggy  it the taste was very excellent. I would go again. It's nice that we have a good poke place on north side besides poke express because they close early..."}
{"text":"Raving reviews for this place. I have gotten food from here twice and each time was delicious. They even threw in a free miso soup with our order. They got my business!"}
{"text":"So my friend's got this for lunch today and I was looking at the bowl and I think it looks so good so I'm like you know I'm really going to do this for dinner so I had the ninja crunch Bowl and oh my gosh it was delicious. I should have asked for extra shrimp but everything on it was just perfect I think so because they're open like they've only been open for 6 weeks they're giving away like free miso soup which is okay I'm not a fan of miso soup other than that I'm really giving it all five stars because I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Yummy,   I've been here several times.   The first time I wasn't too satisfied with my order. The spicy tuna that was added to my burrito tasted a little fishy ( no pun intended ).  Tried it again a second time, with salmon and baked eel. This time is was a much better experience.   Been here a third time now to try out their bowl.  Portions are large and filling. Both times that I'v ordered the burrito I've always had to save the other half for later. When I ordered the bowl I ate it all in one sitting ( salad - no rice ). It was absolutely filling and refreshing."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had and it's not the first time. Every single time no one knows the policies no one knows what's going on I waited for a long time for my soup they charged me extra because I got two scoops of tofu saying that's the new policy if you get two scoops of the same thing they charge you twice but if I were to get something else in a different scoop it would be the same price also after my son spilled his soup everywhere on accident they never offered to help they gave me three napkins I had to clean everything up myself reach over the counter and get the soup while I was waiting for the soup employee was in the back with an attitude on her phone texting. The other time when I went I asked for a tofu bowl to be vegetarian when I told her to add all the veggies she added crab the same girl texting and when I told her no I can't eat crab she said oh well it's already on the bowl I can't do anything about it. Overall the worst experience in customer service I've ever had"}
{"text":"So happy to finally have a poke spot in the neighborhood. Some of the best miso soup I've ever had, the bowls are large and they have tons of options. The employees were really helpful and gracious, I'm looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Great experience here today.it was actually a 2nd choice cause the pho place had technical difficulties. But it was a pleasant surprise. The we had the suma samba burrito with shrimp tempura and unagi and all the veggies."}
{"text":"Excellent Poke! And the staff was super helpful. Generous servings, great ingredients...we would definitely come again."}
{"text":"As an avid sushi-lover, I was a bit skeptical about eating a huge sushi roll that wouldn't offer as much variety as ordering several different rolls. I WAS WRONG, FAM! Everything about this was perfect. I'm going back today and would have gone back a second time yesterday if they would have been open late. Try this! So good!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place or even trying poke. I just happened to be walking past and seen it was a new place so I decided to give it a try.  First off it was pretty empty, just one other couple there. It was clean and the food looked fresh. I told the guy it was my first time trying poke and if he could help.he had no response just asked me what I wanted not even a recommendation or even what sells more.  So I winged it and ordered the bowl with ahi and shrimp wth the greens and traditional sauce. The food was delicious! I'm glad I decided to try it. I will go back again but they really need to work on their costumer service.."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I go at least once a week! Lol! They are always friendly and you just can't go wrong trying out their bowls!"}
{"text":"Really tasty poke! This place is hidden in a strip mall across from the cannery.  Parking lot is kinda cramped because of a bunch of shops/restaraunts in a small location. Staff was really nice and welcoming. I had the Lava Tuna bowl. Really tasty! Fresh rice, and tuna was super delicate. Also shredded crab and crunchy shrimp tempura. It was just enough spice with the sriiracha aioli. The crunch of the fresh sliced onions and cucumbers put it over the top! Great combo of fresh flavors. My bf got the same thing but in a \"burrito\". He enjoyed it, too much seaweed for me though. Also had miso soup that was a bit watery. Mochi was good though but on the small side."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great poke bowls! Excellent customer service! Had the spicy bowl and OMG, it was spicy, but sooo yummy! This place  is kind of hidden, called to get exact location. But was well worth the find. Spotless clean too. Even though it was busy. Don't miss this one!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at a burrito sushi place and Poke Sushitto was really good. The ladies making the food were great about explaining how it works. No more expensive sushi dates for me I'm coming here and spending way less for the same quality food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty small but nice to have close by to our house. The workers were nice but the food was unsatisfying. I felt like the portions I got was small. The rice was small, 2 proteins choices were small, and just small selection to choose from.   The \"sushi rice\" was super sticky, the spicy ahi didn't seem like all the spicy ahi, I barely had enough octopus to even tell how that tasted.  Might give this place another try but that's at desperation if I don't go to my usual spot cause it so far.. Only time can tell."}
{"text":"Decide to try something new for lunch and fell in love. Delicious poke bowl. A little pricy but worth it because they are huge portions. Plus they are fast getting you in and out. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a poke bowl and decided to come here. Service was okay. I thought the portions were reasonable and there was a variety of vegetables and toppings to beef up your poke bowl. There's a couple of outlets in the small dining area so you can charge up your phone while you eat. Overall, it was decent here."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this poke place. The server was very helpful. I had the Lava tuna which was great! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, plenty of options to choose from. Had the oven baked salmon over mixed greens and it was delicious! Will definitely be back! Great for low carb diet."}
{"text":"I came here to get a sushi burrito. They require a minimum of two protein for your burrito or bowl. I decided to get 2 scoops of salmon. They have good choices of toppings and they don't charge you extra except for avocado  but I don't eat avocado in mine so it was fine. The avocado extra charge is $1 for those who want to know. They only have 4 sauces to choose from though, but the sauce they marinate my salmon in was delicious. I checked in on yelp for my free miso soup and soda. Miso soup was good and there was a lot of tofu in mine which was awesome! My burrito was good and yummy."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! Tried this place for the first time on a Thursday night, we were back the next day for lunch. I had a build your own seaweed paper burrito, and it was soooo good! All of the ingredients were super fresh. You will not be disappointed!   I had to take away 1 star for the service. When we got there it was pretty busy, and because it was our first time, we were a bit slow to decide. It was obvious the gentleman that was preparing my food was getting impatient. I felt rushed and didn't want to ask any questions, which wasn't so cool. The next day it wasn't busy so the service was much better.   My advice: If it's your first time, go early, or read the menu WELL beforehand."}
{"text":"I cannot even express how excited I am to have a great tasting sushi burrito/bowl place in NLV near my work. We've been struggling for awhile now to have some good, different places.   It's located in a little strip mall near chipotle in front of the Lowe's. Inside it's a little bit small, only about 5-6 tables so taking it to go might be a better option for large groups.  I recently had the Lava Tuna sushi bowl with avocado added. The taste was very good, definitely comparable to Soho and Jaburritos. This particular bowl had spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, red onion and rice. They don't skimp at all on the toppings or sauces either which I love. I also received a free fountain drink and miso soup with my bowl as a new store opening offer.   I will be back here probably at least every other week. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I like the poke bowls and the variety.  Customer service is good.  So I went two days in A row so needless to say I enjoyed it.   My daughter likes sushi and for some odd reason i was craving it.  I haven't used restrooms.  But overall the place is clean.  They are always busy so the food is fresh."}
{"text":"I'm so picky when it comes to poke, and out of all the places in Las Vegas this is one of my favorite places! Their fish is always so fresh, and I can eat my whole bowl from how good it is. Costumer service is great, and place is always clean."}
{"text":"1st time here Had a burro spicy tuna and tuna with jalapeños and poke sauce it's was the bomb. Clean and friendly place. Definitely coming here again"}
{"text":"Needed a quick healthy meal before the VGK game yesterday and this was PERFECT!  My boyfriend and I were skeptical of this place because of how tiny it was and we had never tried it before. But nonetheless we decided to make our own bowls and even thought we got a lot of mix ins everything tasted so good together! The portion size was perfect and everything tasted pretty fresh.  There was a good amount of seating and the staff was so helpful and told us about their popular bowls and how to create our own!"}
{"text":"Went in for my fix again today! Guess who was super friendly today; yes, the man I previously wrote about.   My bowl and burrito were the best they have ever been!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place a couple times & it's hard communicating with certain worker. I reminded her everytime I ordered a bowl that I wanted furukake on the rice but each time she forgot to. Today I reminded her to put it on the rice but at that moment she still poured the protein and veggies on. I don't know if it's hard for them to communicate behind the glass window. Didn't catch her name but she was working today (4/8/18) at 6pm. I'm trying to make this place my go to for poke in north Las Vegas but it's a struggle each visit to sushitto."}
{"text":"NA-CHO Favorite!  After receiving a hot new business alert via Yelp followed by tons of positive reviews by fellow Yelpers this joint was a must try. Obvi!  I opted for the Poke Nachos $7.99 and I wish I had ordered one of their huge sushi burritos instead. The Taro chips were blah and I'm usually okay with salty sweet. The spicy Tuna was delicious I'll admit; worth a second  visit solely for the fish (an hopefully updated review).  I left hungry this evening (not cool) and ended up next door at Pieology! Skip the nachos go for the burrito or bowl!   Check In: Free Drink & Soup"}
{"text":"This was a good experience.  The food was good.  The service was fast.  However it was hard to understand what the additional beverages were next to the regist"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of sushi burritos, but I particularly like this place. The special burritos are really good and you can also build your own burritos or bowls. The wasabi sauce is very spicy so be cautious if you typically can't handle to much heat. The staff is very friendly and patient with answering questions as this is kind of a new thing her in North Las Vegas. The special is great because with each burrito you get a cup of miso and drink! We'll def be back again!"}
{"text":"Food is great, place is clean even the restroom.  Service is fast, crew are cheerful.   Only thing is knowledge on the sauces, extra training about them.  I have a friend that is allergic to million stuff.lol The answer we got is \"we dont know whats on it.\"   But yeah This place is great!"}
{"text":"This place is actually good for the type of establishment it is. I eat a lot of authentic Japanese food and really didn't expect the food here to be palatable. It's decent for American-influenced chirashi. Good price too."}
{"text":"I'm about to play catch up on all my reviews for the past few months, starting with the most recent and going back.  NLV has been waiting for something like this. I'm a regular over at Soho and have been since they first opened as Jaburritos.. So Sushitto had a lot to live up to.  As expected, it's 'chipotle' style where you can build your own bowl/burrito or select one from their regular menu. Every place is a bit different and I like their differences vs other places I've been to. There is octopus and scallop to select from, one price for two or three scoops, the only additional add on is avocado and it's +$1, which is more reasonable than other places I've been to. YES- masago, seaweed salad, sauces, etc. all free. There is fresh mango to choose from as well. I got it. I liked it. Yes.  So I built my own bowl, as I always do. Half brown rice and mixed greens as my base, one scoop each of salmon and ahi plain (you have the option to mix in a house special sauce or soy), masago, red onion, jalapeño, cucumber with sriracha on the side. I'd normally add Avo and it looked fresh, but I was getting it to go and had one at home so I thought I'd save a buck. The fish was fresh, of good quality and generously portioned. All of the veggies were crisp and exactly as they should be.  We were looking forward to trying the taro chips but they were sold out- so next time! Because there definitely will be a next time."}
{"text":"I never knew this place was here until I turned to Yelp.  I was iffy to try it due to it being around so many other great food spots, but turns out, it belongs there.  I ordered a custom bowl and got to choose my own topping(so if your food doesn't take good, it's because your taste in selection wasn't good). Haha but anyways I'm glad I gave this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Worked for a few months in this location! Not because I worked there but the food is delicious. Not to mention EVERYTHING is fresh from fish to all the veggies. The aioli sauces are delicious and are also prepared in the restaurant. Loved working there. Best poke place in town!!"}
{"text":"Great poke bowls. Portions are big. Prices are reasonable. Service is good. What more can you ask for from a fast casual restaurant. Definitely get the spicy tuna, it's great. And their sauces are well made and really makes the bowl taste amazing. Check it out!"}
{"text":"If you get any burrito wrap. Eat it THERE,  don't get it to go. It doesn't matter you get the soy paper or seaweed. There is too much moisture and when it seeps through the rice, the whole wrap is soggy.  So just eat it there asap.  With that said, the food is good and fresh but the skill is bad. They need to give their employees the bamboo rollers so that your food comes out tight.  Too many ingredients, so custom ordering is a little confusing. Not enough good preset suggestions.  Overall tastes good,  but unlike a burrito, not any hired kid can wrap one.  Side note: Sushi is the art of eating rice, not raw fish.  Raw fish is supposed to be a condiment.  Which explains why sushi rice is unique among other kinds of rice.  So my point is, loading up a roll with a ton of ingredients goes against what sushi is, but then again so does a futomaki."}
{"text":"A welcomed addition to this area. It's a good post-workout meal option after sweating it out at the gym I go to nearby. The first time I came here was on their grand opening. Just like any place's grand opening, it wasn't smoothie and kinks needed to be worked out. Employees were unsure of what they have and that's pretty understandable and things will get better in time.  They have fewer options when it comes to proteins, veggies and other toppings compared to most Poke places. But it doesn't matter too much to me as long as they have my go-to combinations: salmon, tuna, surimi, brown rice, masago, edamame, and cilantro.  I'm hopeful that this place would thrive in this neighborhood. It is located on Losee and Craig in a strip mall with all the food spots are at: Jamba Juice, Cold Stone, Subway, Chipotle, Five Guys, and Pieology. So, it's nice to have a place that offers lean protein and fresh ingredients. I'll come back in a few weeks."}
{"text":"I love this place. New fav. Too bad it won't be a secret for long. The food is bright, colorful and fresh. The flavors were amazing. The price was right. This part of town is in a slump places to eat wise. I predict when the word gets out it will be packed."}
{"text":"100% awesomeness. I was very hungry and this place does not disappoint. The ordering process was a little confusing because the food items and sides aren't clearly labeled. But Justin was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"This is good because its convenient to my side of town. Fish selection is decent, combinations are good. I always feel rushed to make decisions on things like my sauces and toppings though."}
{"text":"It's perfect for when I have a need (want) for something quick, take-out, fresh and healthy. Friendly, and helpful with the build-your-own bowl selection. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Food is super duper fresh and it is such a bargain. And right now they are serving free drinks and free miso soup with every order! And they give you huge amount of food and options. I will be eating here for lunch and dinner for the rest of my trip in the area. Wow. I am so impressed by everything I have eaten so far. And the staff is so kind and welcoming. Well done Sushitto. I wish there was one if these near me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have had poké all over the place but this place is by far my favorite experience. They have multiple House sushi burritos with pre determined ingredients. Since It was my first time there I chose the Lava burrito but got it in a bowl. It comes with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, crab, onion, jalapeño, cucumber, spicy aioli. I added green onion and seaweed salad to mine. It comes with miso soup also. It was a huge amount and I got a small. You would not regret this place."}
{"text":"Love this place, fresh fast and yummy.  I opted for the make your own bowl and I must say I loved it. I will be returning to this clean and friendly establishment.."}
{"text":"I have been in the serious mood for poke. There's a place near my job that I like, but I wasn't driving 25 minutes for poke. So, yesterday, I yelped it & came across this place. It was so good that I was tempted to go back today. They serve hefty portions, so I just had my little bit of left overs & decided to satisfied with that...kinda. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. The salmon and tuna are great, the shrimp tempura was disgusting. Not a fan of the scallops either.  I've been getting the same thing and am happy with my order. The only annoying thing is that there doesn't seem to be consistency with the ppl making my bowl. Some automatically mix up everything some don't and I have to repeat myself a lot. Overall 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"Love this place! The fish always tastes fresh. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is always clean. I ordered a salmon bowl. I brought my friend with me for lunch (it was his first time). He ordered a bowl with shrimp and ahi tuna. He loved it and said that he will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lava Tuna which came with free miso soup. The sushi burrito was really tasty! I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Was so happy when I found out they brought a sushi burrito place on Craig! And even happier to find out it's  delicious  they give you such nice portions and I love that I can make my burrito with brown rice. Every time I go I leave liking it more."}
{"text":"It's was ok not what I'm used to having and getting to order at other spots around town. The Hispanic lady up front was hard to understand and than when it came to payment they had a issue with there machine accepting any of my cards. Would I go back possibly if I was craving this place but I'm good all n all was ok"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here. When we got inside the restaurant , so unfriendly, no greetings, no smiles. I told the Asian lady it's my first time here. She was not very helpful at all. No suggestions nothing. And still no smile. Just a frown. When I paid, it cost me $32. For 2 burritos, 2 chips and 2 drinks.  I looked at my receipt. She charged me for avocado. She could have told me that it's an additional cost. Ok. So I said if it's this expensive it should be good. The burrito was alright. I rather go to Soho burrito and pay the price of best helpful service and delicious food. This place was not worth the price I paid. I won't be back."}
