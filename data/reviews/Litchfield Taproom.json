{"text":"The litchfield taproom is a brewery near the wigwam with an old world feel that has a great atmosphere, friendly service, and most importantly, fantastic beer! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Loved this little brewery!  Great vibe, great beer and a really cool, fun feeling overall.  Went for a few beers with the wife after Valentines Day dinner.  We will definitely be back.  Glad we found this little gem.  I am a huge fan of craft beer and there are not that many little brewery's around here, so I am glad to have stumbled across this one."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved everything about this place. The beer is well crafted and the service was phenomenal. The staff was informative and friendly. Definitely a great stop if you are a beer lover!"}
{"text":"Not many true microbreweries in west Phoenix but this one is pretty solid! Small, intimate bar, very limited space and everyone is very close when it's full which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Beers taste great (they were still naming the on the spot)! Menu limited to 3 basic items, but hell, a brewery should keep it simple! Well done, keep it going!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Had a flight of honeysuckle  st. Ale, Saison Brown Ale, PAB ESB and Savannah Marie IPA. The Brown Ale and IPA were standouts. For food we had a fantastic grilled cheese. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had an IPA which he said was great.  I had an amber beer but would rather have had a wine or lighter beer but they didn't gave that as a choice.  The place is a work in progress.   Needs some ambiance for sure. Dim the lights, add some mirrors (because it is so small, the mirrors will open it up a bit) add wine to your menu and chill your glasses.  Offer a lighter beer choice too.  Menu needs improvement."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, smaller venue, but welcoming feel. Was a great place to go hang out for a couple of beers when we lived closer. We still try to get back when we can. Have good deals during happy hour, and it's always clean in there. Had the pretzel and cheese once, which was tasty!"}
{"text":"It's taken a long time but we finally have a small local brewery by us in the west valley.  Throughout my posts you will quickly learn this side of town is just missing the love when it comes to good local joints.  But no more, we found out about a small brewery that is located in the small historic corner of Litchfield Park. 

The menu is still a work in progress but they have a few snacks and sandwiches that will help you soak up some great pints.  They have about 7 different brews, they have a few IPA's, an oatmeal stout and a red ale too.  The black IPA is awesome and my personal favorite.  

The ambiance is very small, the seating for this place is definitely at about 25 people if that. One of the owners, Neil is there talking and greeting customers and he had been brewing for over a decade and cares about the quality and feedback, I suggest you stop by and support their shop."}
{"text":"Great little tap room in the west valley. Since I am not from that area it was a little difficult to find but I am glad we did. Tucked away to the west off of Old Litchfield road just past the Old Pueblo Cafe. the. If you use Apple Maps or Google, pay close attention to them. I drove by the turn off the first time around. Beer is excellent and the food is great. I had a brat and my wife had a grilled cheese. We enjoyed them both. Nice selection of beers. Very friendly and helpful staff"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with the old man and couldn't be happier. It's a small space, but it works well for the craft brews that they have. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, so be sure to do a tasting flight. My favorite by far was the Savannah Marie IPA, and at 7.9% ABV it's sure to leave you all tingly inside. Happy hour offers a dollar off all their beers, which are very reasonably priced even without the deal. And get this, on Sundays all their beers are $4! They have small bites on the menu, but we didn't get a chance to try them. I'm so glad there is a craft brewery on the west side and can't wait to return. Might even get some growlers to go next time!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid find for the west valley craft beer scene.  Brown ale, chocolate stout, and red ale are all excellent. Haven't had the chance to try the others, but I will."}
{"text":"Awesome beer!! I hope they can develop a decent food menu because this place could be a real hit. It's a small craft beer place with bar food. It's great if you want new beers that most places don't have."}
{"text":"Cute lil brewery! Good service and reasonable prices. Nice atmosphere. Their food menu could use some improvement. She offered us original, cheese, or barbecue chips...we literally had a little bag of Ruffles emptied onto our plate LOL"}
{"text":"This place is an small and friendly place.  A micro brewery with no hidden big brewer front .  It's the real deal sitting no more than 25 people, yet got the selection and favor of someone who knows the craft.  Go on Sundays for $4.  Hope I see you there"}
{"text":"Showed up on a late Thursday night. The place was literally empty, a couple of stool tables, a nice bar, a couple of TV's all while a lovely young lady worked the bar.

I must of came in the perfect time because their handcrafted beer were mostly above 6% abv in my opinion that's the way beer should be made.

Daddy Angus Strong Ale 9%abv was my favorite: pours dark brown, unfortunately their CO2 was a little off-beat so the head lingered a very long time, nonetheless I patiently waited for the beige head to subdue. The taste was Malty, sweet, rich its one of those beers that goes down scary smooth. 

Other notable beers that touched my palate; Haboob IPA, SAISON, SAVANNAH IPA, Red Rain IPA. 

They don't have a full menu (only reason I didn't give 5stars) however I did have a brat in sesame seed bun with onions Its only a matter of time before they get a bigger menu.....I hope.
 
 As I walked out I noticed it was about 20min past their closing time (Thursday 10pm) and our host didn't say a word she just kept on going like she was part of the group. I felt very comfortable I hate when they rush me out by \"cleaning\". 

I will definitely come back with my growlers."}
{"text":"Bartender was so cute and nice and the beer is really good- Paul's pale and pb porter!"}
{"text":"Finally a brewery in the west valley! I HATE IPA's... Neal, I don't know how you did it but I love the sweet Nectar of the Gods that you provide! Keep it up and I'll keep on coming in."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very small and only has beer and snacks. So don't come hungry come for the beer. If you appreciate craft beer this place is a must. If you want bud light don't waste your time you will not like it.

{"text":"Nice little tap room. I don't think they serve food, but the IPA was really good. The service was awesome too. Don't think you will easily find this place. It is near Wigwam and Litchfield Rd. intersection to the east a block and then north. They can't seat more than 20ish people. This is a stub from the Peoria Artisan Brewery (10144 W Lake Pleasant Pkwy Peoria, AZ). They too have great bear and also great food. Some of the beer here is from the PAB. I'd have given the Litchfield Taproom 5 stars except for the high price of $6/beer and how hard it was to find. And maybe the lack of good Brew Food. 

It was good chatting with the bartender and other patrons."}
{"text":"We had a great time at this cozy, friendly spot.  The kitchen was closed due to a supply issue.  The bartender (manager?) said they are trying to rework the menu in the meantime. They are limited on what they can prepare.  They can't cook from scratch (?! Lord help us!).  It was a group effort of most of us who happen to be there and listening to provide him with suggestions.  Oh, and I forgot, the beer was great.  I had a hard time narrowing it down (samples happily given), but it was happy hour (3-7 daily), so I had one each of my top two."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place after a failed attempt at a date - and after opening the door, was immediately greeted by the lovely and beautiful Erika.  She suggested a flight of beers - allowing me to try many of what they had on tap.  I agreed and after my first flight, I figured the best value was in having another one (6 oz. x 4 glasses for $8).  So that's exactly what I did, which was the right choice.  They have your garden variety IPA options, but what impressed me was their Strawberry Field Hef - it wasn't too wheaty, wasn't too sweet, and was quite refreshing.  That said, the beers tasted good, and the grilled ham and cheese, despite being a little too sweet for my taste, was a nice touch.  My advice would be spend some bucks on d√©cor / ambiance and improve the menu slightly - and you've got something.  The brewmaster / owner was in the kitchen making the food, which I always find interesting - but until they get much busier that won't be an issue.  By the time I finished, there were three other couples in there sitting down for a drink - it seemed as if a place like this is well received, and I always love giving business to local brewers - craft beer is my absolute favorite.  I hope this place makes it!"}
{"text":"Good beer and close to home. They have the new brewery/restaurant in north Peoria now, but love the intimacy here. Not big but have always had good easy to drink beers. Staff is friendly but don't have much for food and not aware of any discounts, but they do have $4 Sundays! They're also getting a front Patio soon! Sweet!"}
{"text":"Excellent little brewery bar,super friendly staff and owners, The beer is excellent and varies,you can actually see the beer being made in the back,awesome local spot.my new watering hole for sure."}
{"text":"I've had Litchfield Taproom bookmarked for some time and over the weekend I was finally able to check it out. It's amazing to have a great craft brewery so near to home.

Litchfield Taproom is a bit small so I wouldn't recommend huge groups but it's perfect for small parties craving some lunchtime craft brews. We decided to get a flight of beers to get a taste of which we'd like the most.

My favorites were the Haboob Black IPA and the Arsonist Amber. The beau enjoyed the Haboob as well and the Red Ale.

We ordered food there too. It was a small menu of brats, grilled cheese, and a meat and cheese plate. We split the grilled cheese and brats and both were delicious. Don't skimp out on the onions!

I look forward to coming back here and trying their chocolate stout."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers that changes regularly.  Everything I've tried is excellent.  Good pub food as well."}
{"text":"Peoria Artisan Brewery and their Taproom is honestly really far from my place so it was quite a drive, but worth it. We are trying to visit every brewery in Arizona so it was on the list, but if I lived in Peoria, I would come here more often. It's a tiny little place with only a few tables, but I really like the small, cozy atmosphere. It's a place to stop by with a friend or date for a few drinks and have a good time.
Pick up a flight as they have all the standard styles including a strawberry wheat. The IPa.r.k. IPA was not very hoppy but wasfull flavored with a delicious bready aftertaste. Same can be said about the Paul's Pale Ale. 
Because it's a small place, it's not somewhere you want to bring a large group or party, but better for rolling solo or with a date."}
{"text":"Love the Taproom!  The beers are amazing.  Love the flights.  I've never really cared for IPA's but really enjoyed the one I had.  I also love the dark Haboob.  The tuna melt is really good, as are the pretzels.  Awesome employees and just an overall great experience.  So happy we have somewhere on the west side we can go to that's not a part of a chain!"}
{"text":"A friend discovered this Brewery! Great beers, love the Amber! Husband really enjoyed the fire cheese they serve...will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Bottom line:
Beer was good. The food was good.

The bartender/cook was in the weeds when we got there and stayed in the weeds until we left after eating a grilled cheese sandwich and a brat 1.5 hours after our arrival. Thankfully the owner arrived to help wash some dishes, although I think he should have helped kick out the food first because no one was waiting on beer, but literally everyone there was waiting for food.  The bartender was very friendly and enjoyed chatting it up with regulars and new faces alike. 

I'm glad this is a viable option for a beer. I've grown tired of the offerings at the hotel bar next door and the other bars nearby are pretty rundown and dirty."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday. This place was plain ol okay. Yeah it was a small brewery, which I'm a big fan of. But it was just okay. Nothing special to set it apart. The place is small and feels crowded and the food is bland. The waiter was kinda dumb and messed up our order a few times. I don't think I'll go back. Maybe 1 more time to see what's up. Not sure..."}
{"text":"Loved this little place. A true local gem, with great brews and good food!"}
{"text":"The beer is still very good .. Puzzled and disappointed with the servers who work there now.  Not knowledgable about beer.  Abrupt, nearly rude.
One argued with us about a Pale Ale that is a cornerstone beer .. It was not on tap today and he claimed they had NEVER had it there.  He was wrong .. And it was weird how contentious he was.  We asked the young woman working the bar about a beer on tap and she told us 'It tastes like Miller.'
Really? Bet the brewmaster loves hearing that. 
Like the beer .. Really don't like the service.  Guess we'll fill up our growler, get the hell out of there and drink at home."}
{"text":"Small and friendly, just as it should be! Great unique beers and bartenders are friendly. I live within walking distance and will support them forever. A TRUE microbrewery with handcrafted beers. If you are looking for wine, wayery light beer, or a cosmo, try a chain. If you are looking for a great beer that took some time/effort, this is your spot!"}
