{"text":"Nothing change after 2+ years visit!! The service still suck, food still bad!! I don't know why people still take line up at here!! I prefer pay more $2-3 to get good food and good service!! Agree with one of the guy said \"only cheap people go here\"!
I think other restaurant at hwy 7 is the same owner, they do same worst food and service!  OMG !!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Hong Kong Style restaurant.

Small area, but great food.  And the most importantly is that, they are really good price.

A lot of variety of dishes, from snack dishes to main course.

For dinner, they are having a good value combo.  And worth to try."}
{"text":"The pricing and location just makes this place awesome for a late afternoon snack.  Come here often with my 2 seniors to satisfy their love for Hong Kong style milk tea plus a snack.  Food is decent and taste pretty good.  I'm very satisfied with their fried chicken wings! No overly drenched with batter, you can see and taste the actual wing!  Price is awesome, no complains!

It's not a fancy place where the decor taste better on your eyes than your food to your mouth.  It's clean. Comfortable for the duration you're staying for."}
{"text":"Really good milk tea and lemon tea! Good value. Very popular and always busy  . Convenient for take out. I personally prefer lunch over dinner menu. They also have Hong Kong style breakfast and afternoon tea. Food can be a bit greasy though. Overall solid HK food and good flavours."}
{"text":"Good value chinese restaurant. Overall lunch is ok after 2:30pm, if your order is over $10 before tax, free bread or egg sandwich. Dinner is great and good price. if your order is over around $40 before tax. Free sour/sweet meat dishes. I forgot may be over over $50 or 60. free half chicken."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent and price is unbelievably cheap. Only downside is the line ups."}
{"text":"Beef Satay noodle soup around $5. And it tastes
Really good! And it comes with free milk tea:-)"}
{"text":"As far as the food is concerned, you can't get a better deal for your dollar than Hai Tang. You can get an afternoon tea special for $5.50, and the portion size is ridiculously large. You'll have leftovers to take home. I frequent this place for lunch and afternoon tea the most, although I have been here for dinner a few times. I've always left full and happy to return. At dinner time, if you order $25 of dishes, you get a free sweet and sour pork. This deal might be a limited time offer, and it's not that widely known because the sign they post advertising this deal is all in Chinese and only posted at the front door.

Bottom line is if you want good food for your money, go to hai tang. Be prepared for long lineups on the weekends."}
{"text":"As a courtesy, here is a TL;DR (too long; didn't read): Bad food, bad service, bad decor.

Hai Tang cafe is apparently an establishment with a somewhat troubled history. This will be excused however, and will not be remarked upon, because quite frankly, it is irrelevant to the quality of this restaurant.

Before presenting my case, I will open this review with the one and only positive. It is cheap. Dirt cheap. So cheap, you would believe that you are actually hurting their business. 

Positives aside, we will move onto the overwhelming negatives.

Upon entering, you are confronted with a bizarre atmosphere. Confused is the word which best describes Hai Tang cafe. However, this confusion is clearly the artistic intent of the interior decorator who tried to mix cheap chaan teng with modern chinese restaurant, in true avant-garde fashion. A few of the elements which further illustrate this theme of confusion are the two cartoonish paintings which further confuse the mood of the restaurant. In short, Hai Tang cafe is a child trapped in man's body who is having an identity crisis, and battles with himself over the old and the new, the frivolity and practicality. What a fascinating examination of the human condition, my friends. 

Okay, I will cut the sarcasm now. 

The food is bad. Cheap, but bad. The first item sampled was a simple vegetable and beef rice. Simplicity at its best, and an easy dish for any experienced chef to prepare. Well, that chef must have arrived very late and very drunk to his shift, because the dish came up half an hour after ordering, and it was beyond bland. 

The next item sampled was another simple dish. Beef Chow fun. Also arriving late, it was as unimpressive as it's rice counter part. 

Lastly, the curry chicken. Another simple, but delicious dish - ruined. There was no evidence of any curry. In fact, the dish had more in common with Butter Chicken, but even this was an insult to that dish. The most striking thing was however, there was an Indian grocery store right next door, so how does one botch such a dish with the supplies so readily at hand? Surely the lazy chef strikes again. 

How can any restaurant get away with serving such bland food? Is it something in the water supply that is effecting the tastebuds of the masses? There is literally no saving grace to be had for the food. Well, unless price can be considered. But, why on Earth would anyone not pay a dollar or two more for something far more delicious at any other restaurant? Is it due to some self-gratifying sensation from having saved the aforementioned dollar or two? It is truly beyond comprehension. 

With such a travesty present on our table, my party lobbied a complaint to a nearby waitress. We complained about the quality of the food, to which she non-nonchalantly shrugged off and ignored. What service, ladies and gentlemen, what service."}
{"text":"If you've been to a Hong Kong style restaurant, you know what you're in for. The service is brusque and fast. The good is good and cheap. If you want so-called \"expensive\" fare, go to another restaurant.

This place makes no apologies for what it is and the traffic they get is evidence of how good they are. Prices are decent and their breakfast, lunch and dinner menu is delicious and affordable.

Excellent food!"}
{"text":"A regular for their breakfast. Love their Gui Lin Style vermecelli in Soup. All their soup seems to use the same broth but taste differently depending on what you order. Their soup is not salty, and am comfortable to let my child drink it. 

At dinner time, the moment you seat down, they serve you their daily free soup. Not salty, taste the natural sweeetness from the soup ingredients. We loves the food we order - Taiwanese Stir Fried Veg, Mixed Veg with Tofu and Half Chicken with sauce. 

Great Price, Great Food and Friendly Service"}
{"text":"Only cheap people go here, you get what you pay for. Not worth the wait. For better quality food go to Phoenix.

I have no idea why people give this place good ratings."}
{"text":"Food is average but service was HORRIBLE (or non-existent)! We sat down and nobody offered a menu. 2 ppl came after us (10 min later) and got a menu and food ordered!!  Then my butter toast never arrived and I had to ask 2x for it. Same for the bill - had to ask 2x.
So yeah, if you are rushed, don't go. If you want service (at any level) don't go."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and got four dishes. They give you free dish of sweet and sour pork with dinner orders over $25. 

Steamed fish was very tender and not oily. Sweet and sour pork was crunchy, had good amount of meat inside and flavourful. Steam chicken and crispy chicken both were very good. The meat was tender, and wasn't oily. Lots of crispy chickens are. There fried rice is also not oily, lots of egg and shrimp as well. 


Only issue was the dishes were smaller than average, but for the price it's worth it."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese fast-food, please don't expect good service (or any service) here. It's pretty busy at this location and sometimes you will end up standing for a while before someone seats you or be waiting for a while until someone brings you utensils, but it's not very different than other Chinese fast food places. 

The value is great for their proportions. If your meal is over a certain dollar amount they will give you something - a pineapple bun for free in the afternoon, a free dish of sweet and sour pork at night. All in all, food comes out very quickly and very hot, typical of any Asian fast food place. 

Parking space is limited as this is located in a small plaza off of 16th, but street parking is available outside the plaza."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout here as usual but this time there was a strand of curly hair in my noodles.  The food is good and inexpensive but now we wonder why..."}
{"text":"Hai Tang is a HK style Cafe which I frequently go to. I came here today on a weekday lunchtime, which often gets pretty busy.

The location great, located at a plaza on 16th near woodbine. There is quite a bit of parking so I normally don't have much trouble finding a spot.

The service is typical of a HK style Cafe, quick, efficient, and gets the job done.

The food prices are very reasonable and would probably be cheaper than average. The quality is quite good in relation to the price. I ordered the beef and bean curd rice and the portions were enough to fill me up for sure.

Overall, this is somewhere where I would go for cheap and quick HK style Cafe food."}
{"text":"Cheap cheap food, std HK cafe service, lots of people, average greasy spoon, dinner is more greasy, done by different cooks. Ok to come if you don't wanna cook and don't spend much money."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem in Markham, we always go for dinner as we love their sweet and sour pork! It's so crispy and just the right amount of tangy flavour. We've been here for breakfast and lunch as well. The service is always great, the servers always try their best to seat and clear tables quickly and they are always friendly. We come here once a week for dinner. They also give free pineapple bun or French toast during high tea time 230-5 when u spend $10 or more and during dinner hours free sweet and sour pork when u spent $30, these are M-Fri (could be M-Thrus) if I remember correctly. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite a bit. 

As another reviewer mentioned, they had a rough start. I think it may be because they're now under the same ownership as the place at Hwy 7 and Leslie (Ocean Seafood Restaurant). New management can do wonders, I guess.

The food has consistently gotten better with few misses. I remember back in the day having some really awful, dry, stringy sweet and sour pork and some really dry, tasteless beef. I haven't tried either dish again recently but considering the quality of the rest of the food, I'd like to assume it's all gotten better.

The steamed fish with sweet soy sauce is a top seller and pretty much guaranteed to hit the spot every time. Same with their stirfried eggplant and beans, and lemon pork. The portions are huge too!

Solid, solid, solid. Especially for their extremely low prices. Overall price for 4 people and 4 dishes usually comes to about $40-$50 depending on what you get. You literally can't beat those prices nowadays.

The only drawback is it's DAMN NOISY. The place is tiny and always packed, especially with large tables of 8-10 people parties, sometimes you can barely hear yourself think. Those allergic to noise should probably stay away during rush hours. 

They could work on their space management too. They often pull tables up to the booths and block aisles which is 100% a fire code violation. Makes me a little bit antsy when the place is so packed that you can barely move. I would not want to be caught there in a fire."}
{"text":"There is no system for their line up.  Everyone just crowd the door and tell the waitress they are next.  It is like a zoo.  The food is cheap.  Had the black bean and beef ho fan.  It was pretty good and the milk tea is okay.  Also order the noodle soup which is pretty good.  Ordered takeout for dinner twice and it was good and portion is generous as well.  Overall, cheap price and okay food quality."}
{"text":"I like coming here for dinner because of the decent food and prices. They provide a soup (before your meal) and dessert (after your meal). However, my recent visit was quite negative. 

Coming on a weekday night, the restaurant was very full. We had made reservations for a table of 6 for 8 PM and upon arriving at 7:52 PM, we were told to wait for a bit. We were seated at a small circular table. I noticed that beside us, at a table with the exact same size, there were only 4 people seated at it. At least the server agreed to move us to the larger table next to us after we asked her because of the lack of space for us in the tiny table. The people seated at the larger table were about to leave so she told us to wait 10 ish minutes, which we didn't mind. After the people left, the server told us to wait at the main door because she had to clear the table, and said \"there are 6 people waiting outside, so I need to let them sit at  your (smaller) table first\". Hearing this, we agreed to do so because we thought other customers were going to be seated and did not want to occupy their seats. What surprised us was that nobody went inside! The server LIED to us! 

After waiting for a while, we were reseated at the large table around 8:20 PM. We ordered right after being seated and were provided with our tea. We ordered the Vancouver crab meal with five other dishes for $72.99. The other dishes included eggplant and shrimp, boy choy with garlic and dried scallops, steamed fish, crispy chicken, and beef short ribs. We also ordered an extra dish: the fried fish fillet in corn sauce. Since our dinner was over $28, we had the option of getting a free dish of sweet and sour pork or half of a free range chicken (???). We opted for the free range chicken. The server brought us the soup right after we ordered. However, there were no ingredients in the soup (usually there is some meat and carrots). This time, it was literally all fluid. 

The dishes came in a timely fashion, however, the crab was not very satisfying. They gave us a crab on the smaller side so there was not a lot of meat. The previous time we came, we ordered the lobster (they give you two) which was a larger portion and was more meaty. We are definitely not ordering the crab again.

The beef short ribs was also quite a small dish. There was some fatty parts attached, but the beef was decent and the flavour was sweet. The other dishes (the eggplant and shrimp, bok choy, fried fish fillet with corn sauce, and steamed fish) were cooked well. 

The crispy chicken was one whole chicken with some prawn crackers on top. The prawn crackers were surprisingly delicious. They were freshly fried and were not the coloured ones that many restaurants give. Even though the chicken was meaty, the meat was too salty. 

Throughout our entire meal, no one came to provide us with tea refills. We had to call the server to come, in which case, then she refilled our tea. Also, we noticed that two customers were seated at the table that we were initially seated at. The customer organization and distribution needs improvement as it is not comfortable to seat 6 adults at a table where you seat 2 or 4 people. There is just not enough room for the dishes and provides a negative overall dining experience.

When we asked the server to bring the dessert, she told us that they did not have anymore because it was too late. Her exact words: \"I did not want to ask you to make you feel like I was rushing you. The restaurant would not leave a portion for you\". 

I have to say, this was the worst experience here. The service was negative. The server lied to us saying that there were 6 customers waiting to be seated (when no one went inside to sit at the table) and she gave us attitude when we asked for the dessert. I was not able to get a glance of the server's name, but she is the one that speaks with a super loud voice."}

{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and the food has been pretty consistent. The best word would be 'average'. Not bad, but not great either.

The best thing about it would definitely be the price. My family comes here on a semi-regular basis because of the price and it's proximity to home.

Breakfast and lunch are pretty good, as you can get a meal and the service is very fast! For dinner, you get soup and Chinese dessert. If you order more than $28 worth, you get free Sweet and Sour Pork.
Overall decent food for the price, but have noticed that there is more and more MSG over the past couple years.

Overall a good place to get Chinese food at a good price with decent portions, but not the best place around."}
{"text":"This is my mid early afternoon to go place. Its a small place but i like the environment. Weeknds are always pack. Usually i go on weekdays they have a pretty good deal. From 2:30-5pm mon to thursday i believe if you spend over 10$ you get a free pineapple bun with butter or French  Toast.  Today i ordered a combo 4( vermicelli with pickled veggy in soup and alsp comes with 2 eggs and a toast) very good i always order this for the price you pay and the quantity you get makes this a very good deal. 

The other dish today was the fried rice noodle with bean sprout and beef.  The beef was a bit dry today but it is ok. This dish can be very oily i find today they used less oil which i like. More oil easy for chef to cook the noodles as it stick less to the wok. 

The free french toast was good. Today was more golden brown. Soft and with butter what can you ask for more lol.

Never had a problem eatting here. Servers are nice and friendly. Havent had any issue yet."}
{"text":"I used to come here pretty often when they gave away a free sweet and sour pork dish for orders $25+ for dinner. Nowadays, I find that the food has gotten more oily, salty, and doused in MSG. This is quite unfortunate because their meats and vegetables are quite fresh and decently priced."}
{"text":"As Chinese as it gets with just about everything - food and drink offering, service, atmosphere, and the patrons. You'll feel thrown right back into a mid-sized town or city in the Canton regions of China. I've been here for every time possible - breakfast, brunch, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and it keeps me happy.

You'll find the size of this place quite cozy - and by cozy, I mean the tables are so close together you'll be able to join in on any one of the endearingly-Chinese conversations happening at your neighbour's dinner. It's usually jam-packed for lunchtime, but it's always a favourite for dinner spots due to the low pricing and good variety of dishes they have. 

Food-wise, you can't go wrong (especially for price). You'll be pleasantly surprised at the range offering, timing, and quality of a small establishment such as this, and during dinner they throw in free pork-bone soup and dessert as well. Don't expect the quality to be top-notch, but for hungry patrons, you won't be complaining. Talk about a very good deal, lah! 

Service can only be described as \"Hong Kong-nese\", which is a mixture of familiar, curt, and focused on speed. At times it can get a little slow on service due to a variety of reasons, but there are a few frustrating times that waitresses are enjoying a long conversation before assisting. Still, they're amiable and get the job done quick - after all, life in Hong Kong always moves fast.

The environment itself is, again, reminiscent of everything you love and hate about Hong Kong. Usually loud, Chinese programming on the television, things being yelled cross-room, usually-clean-until-you-find-that-one-little-speck-of-food-you-flick-off-the-table, and so on. Hey, it's a Canton-style cafe; enjoy the homeliness. 

OVERALL: Great go-to place for non-picky Chinese food fans for any time."}
{"text":"Five stars for standing up to one of the most arrogant, self-absorbed, entitled foodies in the GTA!  Thank you for refusing service to Charles Yu.   I took great pleasure reading him whine and bitch on Chowhound because he thought he deserved the lunch specials during dinner, and got all butthurt when you said no...   any restaurant that says FU to CY deserves my business!!  Keep it up boys!"}
{"text":"This place service is getting worse and worse. Walk in to this restaurant and waitress must be blind because there are tables open and they are not seating us and the people before me. Finally sat down and we ask one of the waitress that walk by me something and didn't reply. We got up and left. Never come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim to get some take out while driving past and decided to give this place a try. This is a decent HK style cafe. We ordered baked pork chop rice, baked Portuguese chicken rice, satay beef ho fun in soup, shredded pork chow main, western fried rice. All the meals came with choice of drink. Baked rice dishes were tasty and done right. Other dishes were acceptable HK style. Drinks were fine. Exactly what was expected for HK style cafe. Would come back again for dine in and take out. Good price and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is SUPER AFFORDABLE and their portions are quite large!

Coming to Hai Tang Cafe, it's a bakery with a dine in Chinese meal option. When you come in here, no one will seat you, you have to find your own seat yourself. In addition, you order straight up at the counter, so when it's busy (which is always is) and you come in a larger group of people, one person should sit down at the tables, while the other person orders. Please wait for your drink at the counter, and after that, they will bring the meals out to your table.

I got one of their all day breakfasts to go. The beef satay noodle in soup was only $4.79. Although the quality of the food was not anything too special, and the noodles were actually a little soggy, for the price of the food, it was as good as it can get!"}
{"text":"Wish I had taken some pics as the current pics showing on the profile are outdated, Hai Tang has actually renovated and it looks little bit more modern, similar to \"Phoenix Restaurant\". Hai Tang gets a 4 from me not because it's fancy but it's crème de la crème out of the 'cha chang tangs'/HK café I've been too. Food is quite good and cheap, can get baked spaghetti/rice pork/chicken etc. for about $6 with a drink. Service is quick and not the typical rudeness from HK Cafés. 

On the weekends and possibly on weekdays too, they have afternoon tea special which I believe starts at 230pm however if you go earlier they have some specials as well. 

Just a word of warning, I guess after recent renos it hasn't gotten quite popular and there's typically a short 5-10 mins wait at times."}
{"text":"Very busy for weekday lunch.

Large portions, low prices, good food.

However, lots of young families.  Noise level is deafening and headache inducing.

Do not expect adequate service at these prices.  Food comes fast.  Waitresses will bring utensils and takeout boxes if asked but very understaffed.

Good for young families and takeout.  But not if u want to chat with table mates."}
{"text":"Super cheap hk style cafe. Got no.8 satay beef vermicelli noodle soup. Very gd, tasty and tender. Flavour amazing. cost 3.75. Also had Ho fun black bean beef noodle. Large portion. Delicious. Both come with a drink. And not part of lunch special. This was an 8 am to 530 pm special.  The 230 pm special is about eight items long. Would def go back again but don't have high expectations at all. this is just a nice cheap, quick place if you're around the area. place is not a melt in your mouth amazing but def well worth the price relative to any of those nasty fast fd joints out there. be wary of the waiting service, you don't get a number like in any other chinese restaurant, first come first serve so you gotta watch out who was tehre before you."}
{"text":"For dinner, they serve their daily soup upon seating you down. Their soup does not taste salty yet still flavourful. All dishes are reasonably priced and good size portion. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a good cheap HK-style cafe that's a good alternative to Ho Garden at Woodbine & 16th.

We went here on a Sunday morning and it was pretty busy.  Turnover is fairly quick though and we were in and out in 25 minutes.

Breakfast specials start at ~$3 for an egg sandwich plus your choice of a hot drink like HK-style milk tea or Lemon tea.

I ordered beef brisket rice noodles.  The kids shared ham macaroni with fried eggs and toast and my wife had the pickled cabbage / shredded pork vermicelli.

Overall the food tasted fine -- not amazing.  But for the cheap prices ($5 something for breakfast with drink) and speedy service -- I am more than satisfied.

We will be back."}
{"text":"All the reviews are mixed, I've come here my fair share of times and it doesn't bother me. I always get what I want, I am not surprised by quality for price, and I leave not having spent that much.

This time I had dinner, never had dinner here. For $42, got some fried veggies, got a grouper (fish) and tofu hot pot, half a chicken and some honey garlic ribs.

The hot pot is a steal at like $8. The veggies and cold chicken is what it is, decent Chinese food. The ribs, too fried, left it hard to eat.

They did some redecoration recently which I guess is a result of what someone else said was a change in ownership. I think the place looks classier than it used to. Well done.

I've come here for breakfast and afternoon tea a couple times before as well as takeout, I'd say it's good value.

Tip, when you get in you gotta take charge, get someone's attention fast and yell out how many people. This place is packed and you don't wanna just 'blend in'."}
{"text":"I can't believe that this place is getting such a high rating. I'm kinda surprised. I've been here a few times but I only come due to family. I have to agree that the price is cheaper than across the street by 1-2$ but the food is disgusting. 

People nowadays don't really look for quality food if they can give this place a high rating. One time my dad order a tofu rice and the tofu already went bad. We told the waitress and she didn't even bother to apologize. She asked us so what do you want? 

Another time, my cousins came along, we ordered HK style milk tea and they made lemon tea instead. When we asked them to change it they gave us such attitude.

 I am sure willing to pay more to get something better than what this is."}
{"text":"Hai Tang is usually my go-to cha chaan teng (aka Hong Kong style cafe) when I need to grab a quick (and cheap) bite! The only thing is the cafe is really busy around lunch time so you can expect a 15-20 minute wait before getting seated.

I've tried a lot of dishes from their menu and this time around, we came around 1PM on a Sunday and I ordered beef rice noodle stir fry with soy sauce + hot milk tea ($6.99) and my sister got the Japanese teriyaki chicken with rice + hot lemon water $(6.99) . During lunch and dinner, they offer free Chinese soup to start off the meal :) 

Traditionally, beef rice noodle can be very greasy (the chefs usually use a substantial amount of oil to prevent the rice noodles from sticking together). The dish we had was made just right! The beef was tender and overall the dish was really tasty. The rice dish, on the other hand, could use more teriyaki sauce. Also, they could have been a little more generous with the chicken steak - it was pretty thin but was cooked well - the skin was very crispy.

If you're looking for cheap eats in Markham, this is the place for it!"}
{"text":"My new go-to place when I am craving for some HK style cafe food. This is  definitely a no frills, tasty joint where you will get the most bang for your buck.

Forget about the service (which is actually above par) or the tiny parking lot. Forget about the occasionally dirty tables and lineups during lunch and after noon tea time. This place hits the spot when you are hungry and craving for some fast, cheap, deliciousness.

Not everything is good of course but I would say 80% of the menu is great. The highlights include the baked rice/spaghetti and various rice dishes. Their soup noodle dishes are sub-par I would say so avoid if you can.

A few notes to pass along. They get real busy during lunch time and afternoon tea time (expect to wait a few minutes). They stop serving their HK style cafe menu after 5PM. In the evenings they only serve family style chinese dishes. You will find the same great deliciousness and value in their dinner menu as well."}
{"text":"I love this place and so does my family. This is a no frills local Hong Kong style family restaurant. You order several dishes and share. Yes, it's oily, probably not the healthiest but it's what a Chinese family would eat on a daily basis. The best part, the prices are unbeatable. Example, 5 course 1lb lobster dinner was $41.99 and it includes a big bowl of soup and individual dessert that we have come to expect at a Hong Kong family restaurant. A part of the 5 dishes was honey pork chops, seafood with vegetables, half a fried chicken and a steamed fish. We were pleasantly surprised to get an extra sweet and sour pork because we qualified for their daily special of $30 or more. Every dish was not too salty and came in large portions. 
We also ordered an extra plate of spicy chicken wings which were pretty tasty and juicy.
5 dishes including lobster for $42 is unbeatable these days. You can understand why families flock to this place every night."}
{"text":"I frequently come here for breakfast on the weekend and lunch or afternoon snack on a weekday and it's always been packed. It's a lot cheaper than other HK-style cafe, however on my most recent trip they seem to have raised their prices :| If they continue to increase their price I don't think I'll be visiting as frequently anymore. 

Service is so-so. Don't expect excellent service, but for the price and food it's good for a quick meal. I sometimes order dinner take-out but rarely do 'cause the service is really slow. I once order 4 dishes and they told me the wait would be about 45 mins. I told them I would come back in 45 mins and when I did, they only had 2 of the dishes were ready and that they ran out of ingredients for the other 2 dishes, so I had to order something else and wait again. 

My typical go-to orders are satay beef with vermicelli in soup, macaroni in soup with porkchop (so yummy) and 2 eggs, or the 8 piece chicken wings (also really yummy) with cold lemon tea (kinda dislike how they ask for extra $0.75 for ice...). If you order over $10 in the afternoon, they give you a free pineapple bun with butter and if you order lunch, they give you soup."}
{"text":"Good value for money for lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. Lunch baked rice combos start from $5.95, other rice dishes start from $4.50 and other options such as sandwiches or noodles are around $3-$6 too - pretty cheap and comes with a drink. Lots of variety for afternoon, including big portions of rice/noodle and select breakfasts. 

My go - to dish at hong kong style cafes has always been Baked Pork Chop Rice. The unique thing about Hai Tang's is the cream sauce with cheese and 3 medium size pieces of reasonably seasoned pork chop - a good alternative to traditional tomato sauce!

The Gui Lin noodles is my favorite out of the restaurants I've tried. At $4.50 it is cheaper than other places. 

Beef Brisket Rice Noodle - I like the beef brisket but the noodle is the thick kind (I prefer thinner version @ New City)"}
{"text":"This place gets pretty busy for weekend lunch (11-1pm) so better come early if you don't want to wait.

Now the prices are pretty decent for HK style breakfast. $5-6 bucks for a combo. I got the egg sandwich and macaroni in soup. The macaroni is pretty standard fare. Some msg powder soup. Macaroni. Frozen veggies.  On the other hand, the egg sandwich was pretty poor. Dried up egg layered into two slices of bread.

Would probably never come back as the food quality is below average."}
{"text":"Prices are good, food is just ok. This place gets really busy though. It doesnt ,matter what time of the day. Big servings but dont expect much from the service."}
{"text":"their foods are good, so i can ignore their attitude problem... BUT...

after 3 yrs of visit, now i've to black list this restaurant.  my family and i were having HK style afternoon tea, and we order a pork cutlet, wings, toast, and instant noodle

they put our order wrong as 2 chicken wings, and forced us to have both chicken wings... no apology at all.

tips: if you can't speak Chinese, don't bother to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Why people rate this less than 4 is beyond me. Afternoon tea purchase over $10 free buttered pineapple bun or french toast. $25+ for dinner free s&s pork...

Lunch menu great price, food is great, service is great for a hk cafe.

Can't ask for more. This isn't the keg."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place- always crowded. However it's pretty cheap. You get a big portion for a fair cost. I personally would recommend coming here during afternoon tea on weekdays. You get a choice of free pineapple bun or egg sandwich after 10 dollars.

Side note: don't expect the best service but they are still alright."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
Overall value: 3.5 stars

I have dined in and taken out lunches at Hai Tang Cafe a few times.  Hai Tang is usually busy during weekday lunchtime.  This has something to do with its well portioned lunch combos that cost only $6.99, all come with a hot beverage.  They are better value than food court food, and it does not hurt that the Hong Kong milk tea here is great.

I have eaten its Creme Corn with Fish Fillets on Rice, Pork Chops/Chicken Chops on Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce, a few stir fried noodles, etc..  The food has been passable.  It tastes bold, regardless it is black beans flavour, tomatoes flavour, and generally salty flavour.  The stir fried rice noodle can be too oily for some.  In other words, if you like bold flavours, you will like the food; if not, you could be overwhelmed.  I happen to like sodium."}
{"text":"Other than New City, this is the restaurant we go to every weekend for breakfast. I usually get the Guilin noodles and an iced tea drink. The prices here are pretty unbeatable and food is great. There's always a huge lineup as usually but it moves pretty quickly.

Customer service is pretty nonexistent here but that's with any Chinese restaurant I guess. They're just too focused on serving everyone and turning tables to get everyone seated."}
{"text":"This place is my girlfriend and I's go-to lunch place when we want a quick and cheap eat. We both always get the baked chicken steak spaghetti with black pepper sauce with either cold milk tea or iced lemon tea. Food here is very well priced and food tastes pretty bomb. Our bill usually comes out to under $20 for both of us. Probably one of the cheapest HK cafes you can find in Markham. There are often people waiting at the door for a seat during lunch hour, so be prepared to wait. Service here is below par, but what can you expect from a place like this? The price makes up for it haha. 

They do want you to leave a pretty generous tip, otherwise they will chase you for one, even if you've already walked out the door (this actually happened to me). 

All in all, if you don't mind crappy service, their food is cheap and good."}
{"text":"You know, I have to give credit to this place for holding on despite a disastrous start a few years back. When I first tried it back in 2009, their noodle soup wasn't just watered, IT WAS WATER. Absolutely tasteless, bland, etc. and the noodles itself were clumped together like it wasn't even cooked. Me and my parents all agreed that there's no way we're coming back to this place.

2 years later, I was picking up my grandma from her hair salon in the same plaza, and I was starving and couldn't drive. Looking around, this was the only place available, so I decided to hold my breath (no, not literally) and try this place again.

It has improved! While still not up to par compared to the usual ones I go to (New City, Blue Ocean, Phoenix, etc.), the low prices do make up for it. Now the quality actually matches with the low prices they offer, instead of serving up something I can easily do by boiling water and throwing noodles in without adding salt. Their beef with pickle dish is a particular favourite of mine; an equal distribution of beef and pickles, and just  the right amount of sauce (and taste as well).

However, their iced lemon tea still stinks."}
{"text":"This place started as an upgraded version of a HK style Cafe. When  it first opened years ago, we came and whatever we ordered that didn't have.  So  we left workout starting the meal. In laws highly workout or lately, and I went with it,  which is extremely rare. HK style cage  still  during  the  day,  and dishes for dinner.  Prices are competitive.  Portions are good. Tastes are great.  Service OK.  Place is  small and right.  Don't expect it to be pristine clean. Recommend the honey roasted beef ribs,  raw egg and minced beef with spinach,  and fried glutinous rice. All dinner tables come with  soup and  dessert."}
{"text":"Pros:
Lots of specials at good prices
Good amount of seats

Cons:
Food is average and portions could be better

Another weekend, another HK style place to try.  Hai Tang Cafe is your typical HK style cafe.  It gets the job done and a pretty good price.  It won't do anything to seperate itself from other cafes of the same nature.  Go in with no super expectations, and you won't be disappointed at all.

We came on a holiday Monday and boy was the place busy.  Thankfully, they have a lot of seats here and turnover at HK style cafes is usually pretty quick of we were seated not too long after.  Coming here for lunch, we were given the lunch menu which by comparison to the dinner menu, features a lot less.  Nonetheless, they have a good amount of specials all at pretty good prices.  My GF ordered the baked chicken on macaroni and I got he beef brisket on rice.

Compared to other HK style cafes, the food took a bit longer than usual to come out.  I factored in their larger than normal size for a place like this coupled with how busy they were for the delay. If it's really busy when you come here, expect the same.  

My beef brisket was OK.  some of the pieces were a little tougher to chew.  The sauce was OK, almost a bit too over salted.  It went well with the plainness of the lettuce leaves that come with the dish.  The baked macaroni looked and tasted pretty good.  I wished they would of put more sauce on the dish but that's just me.  My overall feel is the food does the job, the portions could be better.

We were seated in a side room from the main part of the restaurant.  At times it was hard to get a waitress when we needed one.  Being where we were, we could only call them if they entered the room we were in for another reason.  

Hai Tang Cafe as a HK style cafe gets the job done.  It will never impress you, but at the price point you really can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Hai Tang Cafe is the middle child of the owners that own the the lower end Hai Tang Bakery and the higher end Ocean Seafood.  Offering solid HK fare at a great price point this is a very popular spot in the neighbourhood.

Food wise it's not the best you'll have but price wise there's not a lot of negatives for this place.  Morning and lunch specials run from $5-$10 and for dinner they have some really good set menus such as lobster dinner for 4 for about $42.  Really can't go wrong with that amount.  Dishes are about $10 for ala carte and includes complimentary soup and dessert.

This place gets slammed during lunch and dinner rushes so either go early or call ahead to reserve.  They do a lot of take out as well.  Service is very abrupt but efficient.  You will get your food on time even when busy.

Solid 3.5/5.  Good job."}
{"text":"This is the best place for people that loves delicious and cheap food! The food are typical HK style which is perfect for families that don't really like western food. The service is okay and the employees are nice. 

I usually come here with my mom and she loves this Cafe because it's really HK style! Totally recommend this place to people that loves cheap and delicious food! 

They make the food really fast and the wait for the food are about 5-10 minutes. My favourite food there is the beef noodle because it's really flavourful, also the beef is really tender and juicy, try it out! 

The dishes include A LOT of food and it's only around $6 for each dish!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good and price is always excellent. I don't really expect stellar service for the type of café and price that it is, but I agree it can be slow sometimes. I only come in the mornings and afternoons, rarely evenings. 

Mon-fri (excljding holidays) you get either a free egg sandwich, French toast, or pineapple bun with any orders over $10, and you get a free drink with almost anything on the menu (don't know about dinner though) . I believe for dinner you can get a free dish over $30, but I'm not sure what the dish is as i scarcely come during the evenings."}
{"text":"Good comfort Chinese food here at an affordable price! 

Came here on a Saturday afternoon based on a friend's suggestion and did not expect it to be this busy! The baked dishes looked really popular so I ordered the Baked Pork Chop with Spaghetti in Portuguese Sauce. The sauce was pretty good, like a mild curry flavour. I wish they added more sauce though as the spaghetti was pretty dry at the bottom. My partner got the Curry Beef Brisket on Rice which was delicious! My favourite part of the dish was probably the potatoes, slightly crispy to give it extra texture. Since we were dining at lunch time, they also served us a giant bowl of broth which was clean and flavourful. Would return here if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"I was having afternoon lunch cafe and it looked very busy at the time!  The waitress asked to share two other customers in one one table that was fine for me.

I had ordered a lunch special SEAFOOD with PORTUGUESE  SAUCE. On the good note, my HK HOT TEA was great to keep me warm up in this cold weather but however the seafood meat and sauce were a bit watery and it had no flavour taste that I was a bit disappointed.  Service wise, when I ordered the menu the waitress yelled at me and had no customer service experience that I don't even bother to reclassify my order.  It seems to me that it is quick service but the quality of the food was NOT that great.  I would not recommend this restaurant unless you are willing to share a table and fast service from inexperienced waitress?"}
{"text":"I go here regularly during lunch time.  What I like about this place is that its up to 2 dollars cheaper than the plaza across the street.  And for the price, i actually find it better tasting than the 2 competing restaurant across the street.

This place is pretty busy during the lunch time, so expect to wait.  Not much waiting room, can get really crowed during some days.  Contractors seems to love this place, i see them all the time.  So yeah, it might get a little dirty.

Not much going on at that plaza except for this restaurant.  Most of the cars parked there are customers going to this place.  I sometimes have to park in the streets.

They loss a little business when T&T opened across from them, but once the hype was overall, their customers went back to them.

Food, price, and tastes good."}
{"text":"The food you get is very good for the price you pay.
Quality of food is also great.

The restaurant is fairly small, therefore creating a lot of fuss in line ups especially on weekends of after school hours due to the afternoon tea rush and specials.

Service is not so friendly there overall, but I live closeby and visit very often, so ive gotten to know the servers there and are now definately more warm and welcoming.
Its a fast paced environment and honestly.. for the price you pay, you cant expect world class service.

It's a place you can enjoy a quick meal.

But I give it 5 stars for the price and food!"}
{"text":"This place is a Hong Kong style cafe with some tranditional southern chinese dinner. 

This place runs a long time, from breakfast which serve a trandition Hong Kong style western breakfast. Then you get the Hong Kong cafe lunch. Bake rice, noodle soup etc. Then for dinner, it's a Chinese restaurant with dishes. 

This time, I stop by for the high tea. And got the satay beef on rice noodle. The food is not too bad, passable. The dish is quite large for $7. But man, the service sucks. You are almost guarantee to share a table if you are there with 1 other. They don't have too many small table. Then they don't listen to any of the ordering. No patient at all. When I wave them over to add order, they just came by with the bill. And the sharing table can be more organize. Like, please take a look at the table to see which dish goes where and which bill goes where. Like don't ask the customer, they should know

Overall, it's a place to eat. That's it. Service is not there so don't expect anything."}
{"text":"Cheap Cheap Cheap!!

Breakfast from $1.50 that includes a toast and coffee/tea
lunch or anytime from $3.50 that includes coffee/tea
dinner they served entrees dishes...
 
They also has sandwiches that comes with beverage for $ 2 or so...

I made my lunch order with low expectation since what can you get for lunch $3.50?? I was pleasantly surprise. The beef and fish ball I ordered was quite tasty and the portion was just perfect! (The hot chilli oil was great too!)

The service was fast and friendly. My food arrived less than 5 minutes after I placed my order!

This place can be noisy because they have this big plasma TV on loud volume showing Chinese program (all the patrons and wait staffs were watching it and having a good time.....)

Yes I will come back again for a fast  and cheap lunch for sure!

CASH only"}
{"text":"Typical HK style cafe. Always come here for breakfast.  Fast and tasty. Service is good. Staff are friendly.  Love their pork chop.  Their Gui Lin style vermicelli in soup is good too.  My friend ordered beef satay noodle in soup."}
{"text":"I used to always visit Hai Tang cafe for their spicy and sour soup noodles when I still live around the area. I paid another visit last night with my roommate for a quick dinner. The food was good, service is mediocre as usual. It would have been a great dinner, except both of us have been suffering from diarrheas and stomach aches later at night. It's been a while since I dine here and I hope that's just an isolated incidence."}
{"text":"although this location is slightly less busy than the one on HWY 7... the menu is the exact same.  

I found that the food was not as good as the hwy 7 location one... it was okay but not great.  

i would only come back if i was in the area but would not go out of my way for this location."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast on the weekend and it was packed and reading the reviews I thought it was going to be good. Ordered the corned beef sandwich and also the egg sandwich with ham and macaroni combo. The food itself was ok. It wasn't exceptionally good, a little skimpy on the corned beef and the soup base for the macaroni was a little funky. Plus based on the color of the macaroni, they used some cheap pasta. 

Price wise this place is cheap and maybe that is why a lot of people go.

Service wise their kitchen runs on batch orders? You'll see a batch of similar (or the same)  items come out at once not really based on order sequence. So for something like a corned beef sandwich that was more \"unique\" it took forever to come out. If you want fast  service I would recommend getting noodles since pretty much everything was pre-made already."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you want authentic Cantonese cafe style food, you have to come here. Located in Markham hidden away in a small plaza near woodbine and 16, an amazing tasting place. Best flavors and your wallet will thank you."}
