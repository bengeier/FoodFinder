{"text":"So tired of all these wing joints that put out these tiny little pigeon wings and try and pass them off as the real thing. Not here these guys use top quality chicken and house made sauces not the junk out of the bottles. The open kitchen is clean and gives you a great view of the deliciousness they are rolling out. Prices are also really reasonable defiantly two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Small start up, has real potential when you taste the valley BBQ flavored wings. I spoke to the owner & this particular BBQ is not mass produced but his own recipe made fresh daily. Drink choices are standard sodas & 2 types of Kool-Aid.  No BS Kool-Aid, blue & purple just like when you were young. Menu is limited as expected for a small start up & the wing flavor list is longer on the laminated menu than the menu display over the counter. Wings are baked first and fried second before served. Very basic setup
In the dining area. Their valley BBQ sauce starts out subtly smoky & changes to a medium tangy finish. Wings are meaty not skinny, owner is very conscious of finished product quality & is open to feedback."}
{"text":"Amazing wings. Awesome customer service. The pita bread is AMAZING. Definitely a for life customer. The best wings I've ever had and I'm picky!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. I got an order of the boneless wings with their honey hot sauce. 

The wings were good and crispy with just enough sauce on them to keep the crunch while staying saucy. The kool aid was a solid touch as well. Probably my new favorite wing spot and will be back for more"}
{"text":"Place was good. My kids love chicken strips and the strips here were on the money. 

Menu is small and only consists of fried food. Fried traditional wings, fried boneless wings, fried chicken strips, or French fries.  

We tried the traditional wings-high quality and meaty,
The chicken strips-crispy breading, and their French fries-light and thin steak fries. 

Hey have ranch, which tasted like hidden valley from the grocery store and ketchup. No other condiments or dipping sauces. 

The inside is small, can't seat more than a group of six. That's with pushing a side table up to a booth. There's about 8 four person booths, three two person tables, and a bar top that can seat 8. 

If your in the area, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Great new place. The wings are nice and meaty,and cooked perfectly,falls right off the bone as soon as you put it in your mouth. I've tried 3 of their homemade sauces so far and have trouble picking a favorite,they're all excellent. I don't know what they put on the pita chips,but they're incredibly addictive. Fries were great too,and nice large helping for the price. I hope this place sticks around for awhile because it's amazing."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The teriyaki sauce blew my mind! Chicken Alfredo fries? I have never seen that anywhere else. The staff was super nice, the food was delicious, and it came out fast. Right when I walked in, the smell made my mouth water. I would suggest this place over and over. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Wings are good, fries are on point, and the pita bread was a welcome suprise! This is a quaint comfort food spot that delivers on exactly what you'd expect... delicious crispy chicken wings and more.

The owner is friendly and I definitely felt welcome. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I happened upon Valley Wings in search of something to eat one night. I saw it was a new business so why not. It was not  busy, however be warned that you will have to wait awhile as everything is made fresh to order (a good thing) but I think they need a few more fryers to accommodate the demand. (I waited over 20 mins for my order) You have quite a few options to choose from and I chose teriyaki that night with fries. For some reason I thought you were getting full sized wings for the cost. Were they good? Yes but at $1+ for a wing piece ($5.50 for 5 wings pieces) eek! I will return as I do like supporting small businesses and their are other flavors I would like to try."}
{"text":"Ironically enough I was recently wondering where I could find a good mom and pops wings place and thanks to yelp this local spot made my day! Located in north Phoenix and minutes away from my house was very convenient! The selection of flavored wings was impressive. I decided to go with the Parmesan garlic and lemon peppered wings. If you like them hot they do have the habanero and Cajun wings! The wings that I ordered to take out were freshly made in minutes. The meat in the wings were very full and not bony. Even if you desire to dine in the establishment is spacious and very clean. Can't wait to come back and try all the wings."}
{"text":"No good at all! Wings were old and nasty. Waist of money."}
{"text":"I wanted these wings to be good, I really did. But I was disappointed. The wings were tasty but fried too hard and too crunchy. I was disappointed entirely by the fries also.the sauces were also overpowering on the wings, sometimes a little is enough. Maybe I'll try it again on another day and try a different sauce."}
{"text":"Great people.  We really enjoyed the food came out hot And fresh. We will definitely be back to try some of the bone in wings. The sauces were definitely amazing."}
{"text":"The guys that work here seem to be pretty cool guys generally speaking but that's not why I came here..  I came to eat wings..  The menu was pretty strait forward.. Wings, Fries and a few minor things but that's it..  The wings were inconsistent in size but the buffalo flavor was good but but nothing that makes it better then anyplace else.  When the only thing that's on the menu is average at best, that's a problem.. I hope this place success but I don't foresee it unless they can come uip with something that makes it stand out among the rest.."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and ate the same item both times:  A small order of chicken tenders with hot honey sauce for $3.75. WoW!!!! Amazingly flavorful and tender!
I never eat chicken wings but these are so exceptionally tasty, convenient and reasonably priced, I'll definitely be back. I'd really like to see this restaurant succeed.  The owner makes his own sauces and comes up with quite creative menu items all very reasonably priced. 
I brought the second order of chicken tenders home so my husband could give one a try, and he too commented a few times on how flavorful and tender they are. 
Valley wings offers a few unique items on its menu. One is a chicken Alfredo sauce over french fries and there are also other specials too. 
Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"First, the wings were hot (temperature) and fresh. My issue is...they have 4 fewer recipes than Yelp or every card in their restaurant has listed. Also, I get thirsty when I eat wings, and you can choose from bottled water, a few (3) canned sodas, and koolaid. I don't really have a great argument to come back. That having been said, the wings were fresh."}
{"text":"Friendliest guys work here.  I sat and waited at the bar as they made our wings.  The wings were big, crunchy and juicy on the inside.  I was not a fan of the Parmesan garlic, but the other flavors were great.  We'll definitely be back."}
