{"text":"The food and price are pretty good! But the women on the cashier sounded very unprofessional! she was very doubtful and answered questions as if she barely knows something. Besides the weird staff, the trip is worth for!"}
{"text":"You can't expect much from the place. The menu is all over the place. He's got burgers, philly, wings then it jumps to nihari, halwa poori, afghani platter. Most of the stuff they cook is not made in house. Frozen products heated up and served. I would've given it a better rating if the prices reflected to the products they are selling. 6.99 for a frozen burger to be cooked but then again if you are too lazy to do it then well this is the spit for you. It is a ghetto shack so don't expect sparkling clean interiors but doors are still open so must mean they are following health codes. The only reason I go back is for their Zinger burger. Everything else is mediocre."}
{"text":"1. I've been going here for many year. There owners have changed hands many times so the following comments may not still apply.   2. Menu is too large, needs to bring it down a bit, the have South Asian breakfast, Afghani items, then burgers. There needs to be some sort of consistency. But I think the current owners are addressing this.   3. Go To Items For Me & My Family:  - Zinger Burger - really good (fresh)  - chicken boti - really good (fresh)   - fish pakora (dated 2 years ago) haven't had it in a while - crispy outside soft inside (fresh)  - beef roll - this is not for everyone -   It's like mushy shredded beef in a Shan parata, but I like it for some reason  - chicken legs - I think this is the deal on Wednesday's (please check) it's simple and good.   - chicken biryani - nothing special, does the job   4. As long you do not go in expecting top notch service and knowing the burgers are frozen. Then you should be fine.   5. I do feel there is still so much room improve but hope this places sticks around."}
{"text":"Fairly decent place for casual snacks.  They have really good samosa chat.  Worth trying are the kabab rolls specially on the daily specials.  I've yet to try their chargha.  The place also offers Halwa poori nashta and is also open for sahoor during Ramadan :)"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for  quick grab and go cravings! Their halwa puri is amazing, zinger burger and chicken rolls are pretty good too. Never get the biryani but nihari is decent."}
{"text":"The food here is something you should have on a last resort. The burger is just mediocre. A frozen Zabiha Halal beef patty that's been doused in ketchup and lettuce is not my idea of a burger. The fries are never seasoned with salt so they're not worth it. I had their Philly cheesesteak once. It was literally a hot dog bun with a few thin strips of steak and some low grade mozzarella cheese. Second grill made my first philly cheesesteak experience a horrible one. The menu is too large for them to handle, no clue why they expanded it in the first place. Stick to burgers and fries, develop a decent product and then consider adding relevant items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was here to try their Philly Cheese steak and Zinger burger. Alas, they were out of log buns; so I went for their daily special which was regular burger.  The zinger burger was crispy and nicely done. Whereas, the burger itself tasted well but there was much going on in terms of toppings (i think that's how they save on daily special).  Service was quick and it was not a long wait.  Over all good experience and this place is Halal per their signs!"}
{"text":"Went to halwa puri nasta with family, on recommendation, I did try Beef Nihari as well. it was off the hook. Later placed an order for Lahori Charga, And it was awesome too! I might swing by again, when I am in town."}
{"text":"Ordered Halwa Puri. I was specific before placing my order **DO YOU MAKE HALWA PURI OR IS IT STORE BOUGHT** The guy on the phone tells me \" we make it and freeze it to preserve\". Not being able to comprehend this madness I asked to speak to someone else. The lady also get's on the phone and tell me that puri's are NOT store bought and are made fresh here.  I drive up there to pick up my order. Not only I can clearly see that these puri's sandwiched between table napkins are store bought but there happens to be the transparent translucent plastic paper that divides the store bought poori's sitting next to where she was making my puri's. I am like really? You still want to stick to that story?. I than again got BS that somehow they go through a methodical effort to make their fresh home made puri's to look like $1.99 pack of store bought ones. I figured these guys are a bunch of liars and this will be last time buying anything here. I gave the guy 2x $5 bills. Right then I realized I have change in my car and I didn't want him to break my other $5 for .64 cents (total as $5.64 for the frozen tasteless store bought Halwa Puri).  Anyways I get back with 70 cents and the older gentleman at the register goes to me how he can no longer take my 70 cents as the cash register once closed does not open up again. I obviously wasnt having this buffoonery and I told him to open this bank vault and loosen up the damn $5 before things get messy around here. He was then able to compute in his nuclear launch codes to ultimately release my $5 from the register.  Bottom line.  Food suck's. Staff Lies, Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"I have no idea if some of the previous reviewers are referring to the same place. I live right across from this wonderful place, and order takeout regularly at least twice a week, if not more. Their Chicken boti is to die for, as is their reshami kebob. Today we ordered their halwah poori breakfast for an event, and it was scrumptious. Piping hot, with just the right balance of spices. all our guests loved it.  Over the past 1 year, I have tried nearly every single dish on their menu. Every dish has turned out very nice. The owners are a very decent, hardworking couple, and take pride in their quality of food served.   Please try the food at this place. You will fall in love with the food. Home cooked food at its finest  Kind Regards Shahrukh"}
{"text":"The worst halwa poori Nashta ever, she cooks fries and poori and every thing else in the same oil."}
{"text":"They have one of the best nashta, owners are friendly and curtious. Zinger and beef burgers are best sellers.  Behari kabab is also a speciality."}
{"text":"Food is decent and cheap.  They have wide variety of menu ranging from Indian, Afghani to Burgers and Philly Cheese steak.  For $33we bought 3 hamburgers, 3 chicken rolls (these were OK), 3 Fries & 3 can of Soda.  Place is big, dinning area is cold, decor is old but clean."}
{"text":"Never again. Very unfriendly. The food is bad just plain greasy. They keep their cooking spatulas next to the garbage can"}
{"text":"I do not understand the poor review for this place. I've been ordering wraps from them for over 10 years. Owners have changed many times over the years and the food has remained the same.   Please understand: this place is not a high traffic place. It seems that the owners are always struggling to make ends meet. They have a steady flow of customers but nothing to make them super rich or willing to renovate the place.   The good this is that the make everything fresh to order and you have to order over the phone if you do not want to wait there. I always get chicken boti paratha wraps, it's take a bout 15 to 20 mins to cook. They cook the chicken in the tandoor and make the paratha (flat bread) on the spot.   This not a place to sit down and eat.  More of a take out place. I would recommend it anytime for a quick bite over a franchise time sandwich or wrap place for lunch/dinner.    Tip: call ahead and order for pick up."}
