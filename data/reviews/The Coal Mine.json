{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood pub on Library Ave that I've visited a couple of times. 

They have a pretty standard selection of beers, with maybe 10 or so taps and some craft beers on tap.  There was a Flying Fish Porter I had that was pretty good. 

There seems to be a bunch of regulars here and late on a Friday afternoon business was pretty good. 

They have a typical pub menu, and I got a burger with home made chips. The burger had a pretty nice sized patty, maybe a third of a pound, and it was a good deal for $6.95. My craft beer was $6 and Yuengling drafts were $2.50. 

They have several screens and later in the afternoon they had the local news station on with audio playing from the TV. 

I seem to remember smoking allowed here, but on a nice day they had the door opened with a nice breeze coming through. It was pleasant to sit at the bar. This is a good place to come for pub fare if you're in the neighborhood."}

{"text":"This was our first time getting food from the Coal Mine. We went in to order wings to go. The Pens were in the Stanley Cup playoffs and we wanted to take wings to the place we were going to watch the game. The dining room doesn't serve food on Sunday evenings (not sure about lunch time). So we went to the bar to put our order in. It seemed like all of the patrons were all people who hung out here a lot.  It took about 20 minutes to get our wings. We took them straight to the party. 
We had ordered 3 dozen-1 dz Garlic Parm, 1dz BBQ, and 1 dz Hot. I ate 3 of the BBQ and 3 of the Garlic Parm. The outside was crispy and the inside was was juicy. They were very good and they didn't skimp on sauce. In fact they even gave us a ton of wet naps for our hands. The people who ate the Hot wings thought they tasted more peppery than hot. I can't eat hot or spicy food so I have to go by there comments. They thought they were good just more of a peppery taste than they expected. I would like to go back some time and try another menu item or two. It's on the smaller side-maybe 8-10 tables in the dining room-but the bartender hand his helper were very nice."}
