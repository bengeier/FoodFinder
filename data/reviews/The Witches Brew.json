{"text":"I was \"over the moon\" when I had heard that a new store was opening in Kensington Market that specializes in kombucha. I have been drinking kombucha for a little under a year (different brands and price points) and I have to say that Witches Brew kombucha has been the best so far. No guff about it. It is flavourful, without excess carbonation or additives and most importantly, it was EASY ON MY STOMACH!!! I have tried their Peripheral Vision (yum) and a special blend they had created for this month called \"Full Moon\" (which was tasty, but mild). Great idea for the cute reusable bottles!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Stumbled upon this place after lunch at seven lives. You can stop in and order by the glass (in plastic cups) or you can order larger bottles to take home. They'll give you little samplers when you come in so you know what you're getting yourself into. 

Fermented delicious poured into a bottle. Is there anything better?"}
{"text":"a gorgeous company with an equally epic product. delicious flavours on tap with waste free container options that provide you with a discount when you bring em back for refills. so glad I don't live near by or else I'd have a feeding tube linked from my mouth to a tap!"}
{"text":"Been craving Kombucha ever since I discovered it in San Francisco and The Witches Brew definitely satisfies that need! They sell kombucha on tap and by the bottle, providing an inexpensive way for Torontonians to stock up on the fizzy beverage."}
{"text":"Walked in and was immediately greeted by smiling faces! They were very knowledgeable, calling Africa the motherland I knew they were the real deal! I believe I tried and loved Peripheral, very light flavor and super refreshing on a warm day! Whenever I return to Toronto this will be on my list of places to go back to!"}
{"text":"Cutest little kombucha shop with some interesting, locally-brewed flavours! Nice to see that they use compostable/biodegradable cups, in addition to glass bottles that can be reused. Yay. Will be back to try any and all of their ginger flavoured kombucha for when I want an effervescent pick-me-up."}
{"text":"delicious local craft kombuchas on tap with tastings in Kensington Market.  can take it bottled (10% discount to return if local) or in biodegradable compostable plastic cups.  Embrace Me and Ngozi's Dream were my favorites."}
{"text":"The kombucha here is really light in terms of mouthfeel which makes it more refreshing than most. This isn't necessarily a good or bad thing depending on what you're going for. It's definitely unique though and depending on what your'e going for it's definitely worth a try. The staff is also super friendly and happy to let you try their selection. And do try them, even if the flavors may sound familiar they takes they have here are still unique."}
{"text":"What a great kombucha bar! Bonus points for the cute store name. It's a perfect place to stop in for a healthy, refreshing drink while walking around Kensington Market. Their kombucha is fresh on tap, so the flavors will vary depending on when you go. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So far, so good! You can order ahead of time on their website.
They have delicious blends on tap and these will change with the seasons.

Can't wait to drink a ton more kombucha!
And most importantly, they are open when they say they will be."}
{"text":"Amazing place in Kensington market for fresh and delicious kombucha! 

Prior to coming here, I would only drink the ready made bottled kombucha you can get at grocery stores. After coming here, I can never get enough and I only want the fresh stuff. What I really like about this place is that they allow you to sample as many flavours of the housemade kombucha as you like before you finally make a decision. They always have different flavours to try which means there is always something new and there is something for everyone's taste... I'm a big ginger guy so I always go for the flavours with ginger. The employees are also very knowledgeable and friendly, and they are always excited to talk about the different flavours. The place also sells some cool trinkets like stones, crystals, books, incense sticks, etc. Definitely gives very earthy and positive energies. 

For people new to kombucha who want to try it for the first time, definitely come here - you won't regret it!"}
