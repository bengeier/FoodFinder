{"text":"I loved the environment, the people, the customer service couldn't ask for a better dinner. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious Stopped here on a whim and it may be our new go to in this side of town.   Had an amazing ceviche and legit Carne Asada tacos.  Service was on point!"}
{"text":"Good place in Vegas to try sea food in all kind of ways. My favorite \"Mojarra frita\" oh yeah I love the crisp of the fried fish, I have tried almost all there and all is very good!, don't forget to try \"Carne Sarandeada\" & the Micheladas..."}
{"text":"The food was terrible I order shimp with bacon n cheese n they were hard n didn't have a good taste n to let you know they don't clean the shimp at all you could get sick from this is  so disgusting. I would never go back and the service is terrible."}
{"text":"I love the food but service is the worst ! Had to wait for them to clean the table ..there was 6 tables dirty no where to sit .  Waitress took another 15 minutes to bring menus.    The food was good ...we waited to get the bill after asking waitress 20 minutes!  I finally walked up to the cashier and asked is the food free because I been waiting for 20 minutes...at no point did they apologize ..paid the bill waitress got $0 tip and that was very hard for me to do...if I decided to go again and this happens I will walk out without paying"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, super great cerveza preperada. Im in!"}
{"text":"This places rips you off charges you more than they are suppose to adds gratuity to your check doesn't tell you or give you a receipt until you have paid. Aside from that food came out horrible along with service we told our server our meat was under cooked came back with small pieces of meat never did a manager come by the table to see how was everything!!! Will never go back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great environment! A must try!! We come here all the time. Try the aqua-chillis there our favorite. Staff is freindly"}
{"text":"Absolute worst restaurant experience!!! UUUGHH I was so annoyed to have driven across town to this smelley dingy restaurant... I should have known just by looking at the overall location... First off no hostess to acknowledge you at the door, my friends and I stood there for a good 15 minutes before even getting a hello, Finally we were seated in a corner booth with a huge table blocking our exit. Thankfully our waitress was a sweet caring Latin/Cuban girl... She was helpfull and knowledgeable of the menu so we ordered right away, however our food arrived cold and soggy very disappointing=( The taste and service is far short from the original restaurant and i will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Had lunch with some friends and the food was not just good but very good.  We had BBQ fish and an arrangement of many different shrimp, cerviche, and other sea foods.  It was just a great meal.  So pleased that I went there with my friends.   Dennis D."}
{"text":"The outside looks as if the restaurant is closed so we were a little skeptical until we saw someone go in.   I came with a group of people on a Friday. We had done some drinking the night before. I ordered a michelada. It was a bit temperature hot so i had to order a cup of ice to put some in. They had salsa and tostadas as starters. The salsa was very good especially if you add lemon.   For my entree i ordered \" El ceviche de camaron casero\" which is basically ceviche de agua chiles. This was so good and the plate was really big. I shared it with everyone.   I also had some of my bf's regular shrimp ceviche. This was also really good.   A person we were with shared one of his shrimp empenada. this was really good and the sauce it came with was really spicy but delicious.   The service here was also really great. The waitress was really nice and attentive. She kept coming around to ask if we were doing ok. She did a really great job considering our party consisted of about 15 people.   The decor is very nice too. Its full of really comfortable chairs made in Mexico named EQUIPALES.   Next time I'm in Vegas i will definetely be coming to El Diamante."}
{"text":"Mariscos El Diamante is pretty much just like Mariscos Las Islitas. But I rather go to El Diamante because it's not as crowded or busy; although majority of the time we take our food to go! Portions are big so it's worth it. I always order a Vuelve a la Vida (cocktail with all kinds of seafood) and empanadas de camaron! If you're looking for a new Mariscos place that's not as crowded this is the place."}
{"text":"Five stars for the ceviche casero alone. Omg ! Best Ive ever had! I've came here a week ago and I've been craving it every day ever since. So fresh, flavorful and a little spicy. Michelada preparado was amazing as well. This place: AMAZING!!!! Muchas gracias"}
{"text":"Everything was great till my dad found a hair in his plate and the server forgot my little one's order i been com8ng to this place for about two years and nothing like this ever happen i guess there slacking on the service now"}
{"text":"I had been to this place one time before my recent and LAST visit to this place. The first time around everything went smooth, the food was great, the service was great, no complaints. The second time around, it was a completely different experience. Let me start by saying ABSOLUTELY WORST SERVICE EVER. We walked in and the place was busy. When my boyfriend and I walked in we made eye contact with a waitress, who rather than sitting us down went about her business as if we were not there. Rude much? We get seated and we ordered our food. I ordered a small order or ceviche and my boyfriend order two empanadas and a tostada mixta. The ceviche was good, but it was missing avocado. Every other restaurant that I have gone to and ordered ceviche serves avocado with it. So I asked the waitress if I could please have some avocado. A HALF HOUR LATER I get my avocado, a whole avocado, by this time I am practically done with the ceviche!! The empanadas were fairly good, not the best. My boyfriend's tostada, wow I do not even know where to start! To begin with there was ONE shrimp on it placed neatly on the top of a mountain of haiva which is crab imitation. We dig through the pile of haiva only to find two pieces of octopus which did not look appetizing AT ALL. On the bottom of it all is what seems to be a tomato sauce. When I tell my waitress that I did not order a tostada de haiva and that I ordered a tostada mixta she simply told me that she was sorry but that it was not her fault that she did not cook that. She does not even offer to take it up to her supervisor or to return the food, NOTHING! At any other restaurant the least they do is ask if we want the food returned or replaced. Then I look for a waiter and tell him about the issue, and just like the waitress, he does nothing but explain that it is the way they make them there. Absolutely ridiculous, anyone can google a tostada mixta and you will see that nothing looks like a mountain of haiva. WORSTE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the piña mixta which  it was very tasty, also the shrimp cocktail was fresh and delicious, although the burrito was very bland with only meat and cheese. we were a table of 16 people which the server did a great job getting everyone's order right.  Our family had a great time even though  We wished the group that was singing could've stayed longer."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 0 stars. Worst service I have ever had. I'm so glad I didn't give this dump any of my money. Where to begin:  My girlfriend and I wanted Mexican food so we go on yelp and decide on this place. There are no hours of operation on yelp for this restaurant so I call the phone number to ask when they close. The phone rings 10 times, no one answers, I hang up. I call again about a minute later, the phone rings 4 times and a woman picks up and speaks Spanish. I ask her \"what time do you guys close?\" She speaks Spanish back to me. Now I understand this is a Mexican restaurant but the woman answering the phone should be bi-lingual and be able to speak English. BUT, my girlfriend speaks Spanish so I hand the phone to her and she asks in Spanish what time do they close. The woman apparently couldn't hear my girlfriend (over the blaring music in the restaurant) so my girlfriend asks 3 more times...every time the waitress didn't understand her so the waitress hangs up. My girlfriend calls back and asks again and finally the waitress understands.  We head to the restaurant and the music is blaring we can hear it outside. Now I have been to Mexican restaurants before with live-bands and I enjoy it very much but this was a bit ridiculous. They had not only a live band playing but they had three huge loud speakers that the live music was blaring out of. I am not one to exaggerate and when I say I couldn't hear myself talk, I literally mean I could not hear myself talk. I couldn't understand my girlfriend and she was two feet away from me. We walk up to the front counter and there is a girl behind the counter typing away at the computer. Doesn't acknowledge us, doesn't look up, doesn't say hi. Just keeps typing away at the computer. We wait there for about 45 seconds and another waitress walks up to us and points to a table in the back.  She doesn't walk us to the table just stays behind the counter and points to the table. We walk through the restaurant to the back and notice that every single empty table is messy (food scraps, plates, glasses) no empty table is clean. We get to the table she pointed out for us and sure enough it has food scraps and chip crumbs on it. We sit down and I take a napkin and wipe away the food crumbs. The waitress comes over to us, does not say hello. Just hands us two menus, cleans up the food crumbs and walks away. Didn't smile, no hello how are you. She didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink. Just walked away. My girlfriend and I sat there for about two more minutes and decided we were going to get the hell out of there and we did. We got up and walked out.   Terrible experience. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced for quality. Shrimp cocktail taste like water with shrimp. I'm Mexican and know how to cook and how cocktail taste like.  how can they not know what to add on the food while cooking it. hey some garlic or onion or perhaps salt. No flavor to it all. Also all food that is deep fried looks brown as hell like they don't change their oil. The empanadas and the breaded shrimp are disgusting I can taste the old oil that has probably been reused for  days. Never again I will eat there."}
{"text":"This is one of the best mexican seafood restaurant.  The outside is a little ghetto but once inside it is very nice and all the food and drinks are on point. The best in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went based on a recommendation my husband and I got saying that it was good. Out usual spot is Las Isletas, but we were down to try something closer to our place. The food was decent and we both tried something different than what we are used to with our other usual spot. Hubby got the SEAFOOD TOSTADA and the SEAFOOD ENCHILADA while I got the PINA MIXTA. Overall, the food was decent and the TOSTADA was pretty tasty with the various seafood (ceviche, octopus, and imitation crab) all on one tostada. What I ordered was pretty decent. I felt overwhelmed with more pineapples than the SEAFOOD as they delivered it in a half carved out pineapple. The grilled spears was a nice touch and the rest of the pineapple were mixed in with the nice sweet and savoury sauce alongside some shrimp and mini crab legs. The ENCHILADA wasn't my thing as the texture of the shrimp (kind of like ground up shrimp) was off putting. I would much rather have it not too finely chopped, but just some decent chunks of the shrimp. In addition, I'm used to the wet enchilada and it looked and tasted like it was pretty dried up not having too much sauce. Hey, I'll admit I'm used to the non traditional Mexican foods while my Mexican hubby was quick to coach me that this is how it really should be. Anyhoo, we went on a weekday an hour before 12 and of course, we didn't anticipate that it would be busy. Was disappointed that the service was lacking despite that. We were only tended to when the food came in and when I desperately needed some refill on my drink after a spicy taste of something, I was dismayed to see the girls just chatting for a good while. I swear there was a water cooler nearby with the length of their convo and I might as well have fetched my own drink.   Will I go back? Maybe with a twist of my arm I will, just to not drive too far to my other spot across town. I'm down to give them one more shot and make sure to have them deliver 2 drinks at a time and hopefully amend this review with another star."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The portions are big which makes up for the seafood type prices.  Loved loved loved their Micheladas. That thing was delicious. I had the mango michelada.    The ONLY reason their rating was not a 5 star is because in the middle of our experience the mariachi got going playing table to table, and then you had a banda literally in the middle of the restaurant (which is not that big) going full blast playing their seperate music. To top it ALL off the restaurant still had their pandora playing over their speakers.  Yeah got a little hectic. Don't know if this is the new norm but personally it was too much for me. I enjoy the music of my people while eating but damn, we couldn't have just one thing? We HAD to have that many choices going at the same time?"}
{"text":"The waitress Patricia fkn sucks she charged herself 11$ off my card when I already had left the bitch a tip she has horrible customer service if you go don't let her be your waitress she's a thief she will charge extra on your card and claim its an accident my fkn ass. She needs to get fired if she did that to me how many other ppl hasn't she done it to."}
{"text":"If you like shrimp dishes, this place could be for you. They have a plethora of shrimp dishes. We had a ceviche dish and a shrimp fajita dish. Both were definitely tasty.  Overall, not an especially fantastic dining experience, but the food is okay."}
{"text":"I had a michelada and tostada de ceviche. A little too much lemon on the ceviche for my taste but still good.. Michelada was tasty but I'm still looking for my favorite in town. They had live music so that was pretty awesome! Oh and a little too pricey."}
{"text":"Being New to town a neighbor recommended his restaurant to us.  The food was pretty good but not what I am used to.  The menu is mostly in Spanish and we had to ask the waitress for help to order.  Turns out the waitress was very nice but barely spoke English and had to have the drink sever come and translate.  I felt a little out of place and we had to almost scream over the music from the stereo to talk to each other at the table.  Not a bad place if you speak Spanish and are from this part of town."}
{"text":"Authentic food freshly made with amazing taste. If I could do I would give this place six stars. Menu is perfect for for lunch and or dinner and will fill you up quickly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Another great lunch at El Diamante's with by buddy Jessie.  Had the Baja Tacos and a dozen Mexican style Oysters plater.  Oysters where big with shrimps and pico on top with a small plate of cut up limes. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went for Valentine's day and ate camarones al patrón and camarones Imperial. So good and freshly made. The micheladas aren't that good. But other than that, great restaurant. Awesome customer service"}
{"text":"Apparently this is the spot on a Sunday night. Restaurant was very busy. They had a live Banda as well. But the way the speaker was set up was horrible and it was way too loud for such small venue. Just beware, you might lose your voice from screaming to the person next to you. Service was good despite the fact that they were very busy, and us being such a large group.   For food, I went with the \"Camarones a la Diabla\"... um  never again. The sauce was way too sweet and it tasted like a spicy ketchup concoction. It was served with rice and beans and  your choice of either corn or flour tortillas.  My boyfriend had the \"Garlic Shrimp\" and they were okay. The garlic was not fresh and tasted very artificial. All my friends order something different and nothing looked amazing.   Overall this place was more for entertainment and not so much for the food."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE !! el servicio de lo peor lo mas triste es que fui para mi cumpleanos con mi familia.. Primera y ultima bes que fui... Llegamos y nosotros solos nos sentamos xk ? Xk las meseras andavan muy ocupadas de coquetas . depues de 10 mins nos atendieron! LA comida estava mas oh menos no creo regresar"}
{"text":"Good food but they are ridiculous to charge the chips, if im expending $90 dollars check in a table of 2, we order 2 ceviches caseros , 5 beers, 6 oisters preparados, and they charge me for the chips!!! Jezzz not ever again , just feels like is unfair cause chips come with the ceviches right, well people be careful and read your check before you pay cause they will try to charge you for the seat too."}
{"text":"We wanted some real food not bar food a local Vegas friend recommended this place and let me tell you it as delicious!   - Excellent service  - Quick  - Clean  - Delicious   We enjoyed El diamante  make sure to try their Michelada's; Tostadas Mixta"}
{"text":"Mexican seafood , but not very authentic . I've tried a variety of places like this and this is probably the lowest ranked one , had a mixed cocktail with all the seafood goodies , lacked a lot of lime and salt flavor so had to ask for extra. Was brought chips to start and also for the apps and meals and some were kinda stale . The gobernador shrimp tacos were terrible , double tortilla and fried just made the outer tortilla crispy while the inside soggy , rice was good though . What was good was the portion sizes for both and not too overly expensive . Waitress came to us only to grab our order , after that didn't see her till I needed my check ."}
{"text":"I search high and low for good \"mariscos\" or seafood for my people that aren't Spanish savvy.  Competition is tough on this side of town, but El Diamante is a very popular spot.  3 stars because they don't offer anything that makes them stand out...in my oopinion.   FOOD: As an app I started off with some ceviche, not the best tasting I've had but the seafood tasted okay.  I got the langostines and boy were they delicious I could taste the garlic and citrus flavors in each bite. Also got some asada tacos, meat was dry, only ate one. Loved my mangochelada!  CUSTOMER SERVICE: Staff was very friendly and prompt. Great service.   ATMOSPHERE: Very nice \"tropical\" ambiance love the live music they had, the singer had the customers singing along with him. Parking shouldn't be an issue, but it can get tough during busy hours.   Would I go back? Most likely not...but wouldn't decline an invite."}
{"text":"Salty Salmon, Inedible clams, wasted my money, two stars because one of my group enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is the definition of Mexican food!! The micheladas are the best y el ambiente tambien"}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks! Dayana is an awesome waitress. Burritos de camaron are sooo good also their ceviche casero!!"}
{"text":"One weekend ago we celebrated my dad's birthday.with all the family,we wore 18 of us,everyone enjoy the food.my brother came from Cali and he was impressed with his food and la Banda...great job everyone in the restaurant,keep up the great job."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Let me clarify something, I am Mexican and I know Mexican food. Having said that, I came here for dinner and ordered a Mix Seafood Tostadas. What did I get? Tostadas with no seafood full of fake imitation crab. I brought it to the attention of the manager who stated that its how they make the tostadas here. Really? Maybe they were having a bad day, but even so they deserve a bad review."}
{"text":"Que porqueria de comida. No tiene nada de savor toda desabrida. Y los precios ni digamos. La verdad no bale la pena. A mi no me importatia pagar 25.00 por un plato de comida pero que balga la pena. Una desepcion total!!!! Y claro que no recomendaria este lugar."}
{"text":"Went to lunch.  No lunch specials.  Device so-so.   The shrimp cocktail was horrible.  No flavor.  Shrimp were not deveined and tasted old.  The music was blasting for the liking of the servers and not the customers.  The lemon fish was not good.  I would fire the cook and focus on the customers.  There is much better around the area."}
{"text":"I came with my family (32 of us)! Despite the amount of people we were, service was great. They were on point and attentive. They weren't able to split the check, but were nice enough to allow us to pay each family's portion individually."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  My friend and I were actually waiting at Las Islitas, but because it was a fight weekend AND Mexican Independance Day we couldn't hold our appetite any longer.  Someone had mentioned El Diamante to us so we figured we would try this place out.  We called to see if they were busy, which they said they were but said they would set up a table for two.  This place was not as busy as Las Islitas, but that was good for us.  They have mariachi bands as well.  Now if you are not used to mariachi bands playing while you eat, you might want to bring earplugs.  Not saying that they are bad, but it is REALLY loud.  Not a place to have intimate conversations, this setting is to eat and drink and enjoy the mariachi band(s).    Food wise, we had the appetizer oyster topped with ceviche, omg that was so tasty.  Their seafood dishes, you cannot go wrong.  I actually had a beef dish to mix it up a little as my main dish, but I can't recall what exactly it was called.  Its a really long name that started with a Z...haha I hope that helps but that was yum.  They serve it with 4 tortillas.  2 with Cheese the other with beans.  It was delicious and spicy and I emphasize SPICY.  I highly recommend.    My friend spoke fluent in Spanish and that did help a lot.  Makes the conversation with the staff easier.    Their food is yummy and I will definitely return for more.  I just would feel comfortable bringing a Spanish speaking person with me, LOL"}
{"text":"Mal servicio y al pagar se quedaron con mi tarjeta y al reclamarla las personas se molestan la comida fría y sin sabor"}
{"text":"Their ceviche and Micheladas are the best I've had in Vegas.  The portion size is huge and could easily be shared amongst 4 people.  They usually have a live band playing every time I come here.  Their guacamole is different from others because they add cotija cheese.    The only complaint I have about this place is their horrible service.  They take forever to get your order and they never follow up with how the food is.  You're basically on your own from once you order until you ask them for the check."}
{"text":"They have some really good drinks, the only purpose I see in going here. Otherwise, the food esta toda desabrida (tasteless) and customer service sucks! Maybe it was just my waitress, but I had to keep getting the manager's attention for anything I needed which was also a hassle. I was really disappointed, I had such high expectations after having their Mangochelada."}
{"text":"No se merecen ni una estrella. Lastima que tienen a puras viejas vale madre trabajando como meseras. Lo primero que se hace antes de sentar alguien en una mesa, es LIMPIAR la mesa, luego cuando se entregan los menus, se le pregunta al cliente que gustan tomar? De cuando aca este pinche lugar se volvio Las Palmas? No estoy en contra de chirrines, pero se pasan la verdad al dejar a musiquillos traer bocinas."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday evening and was pleasantly surprised with the live music, it really created a fun atmosphere. The server was very nice and patient, he did forget 2 of our drinks but was very respectful of that. The food was hit or miss. Do not order the octopus and shrimp tostada it's plain, tasteless and dry. The prepared oyster were good, not great. My friend did like her shrimp tacos and I liked the micheladas. Overall an ok experience."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty legit. They give you limes for everything, which I love. The portions are really big but this is some of the most expensive Mexican food I've ever had. Instead of typical tortilla chips served with salsa they give you big tortilla rounds like for tostadas. I didn't like the beans at all but the rest of the food was amazing. Most of the menu is in Spanish but there are brief translations after some of the items. We received great service and I don't have any complaints except the prices were insane. I'm pretty sure nothing was under $10 and I could find Mexican food anywhere else for a better price. I'm not from Vegas so I don't know that for 100% but everywhere else I've ever traveled I could find better prices."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW 2018:  El Diamante has been at this location since I was kid. Before el Diamante it was a McDonald's, I was 9 when it changed. It's located on Charleston and boulder for god sakes. I'd rather see a local business before a corporation. If you're looking for an elevated experience. Kick rocks and head to the strip. This place isn't for the faint of heart. If you hipsters are looking for service, gtfoh. This is a family owned restaurant that has been a staple in this neighborhood. I'm Filipino and I've always have waiters that speak little to no English. I stepped into their world for an experience and they have never let me down. El Diamante keep up it up!! Every time I'm in your neighborhood I pick up a dozen of Camaron empanadas and some aguachilles to go! If you appreciate any sort of live music for the beauty of it, they have live banda on the weekends. Also check out their second location on eastern and trop. Just recently opened the last few years."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican spots in Las Vegas The food is the real definition of Mexican food I love going on the weekends when they have the live Banda playing if u like a quiet place to eat this is not for you and if u dislike Mexican music it's not for you either ."}
{"text":"Yummy. Take a trip south of the border. Love this place more everytime I eat here. I love the shrimp cocktail. Fajitas are fabulous and the quesidilla is divine.  This is my favorite Mexican seafood in town!! Far and kind of pricey, but worth it"}
{"text":"This joint is close to work HQ and surprised I didn't come here sooner.  It's a great authentic Mexican restaurant known for their mariscos.  Still, I find it awkward to elaborate about places that are from different cultures.  I find it hard to refrain from rolling my eyes and SMH when heads provide their rendition of their review of other cultures without knowing the real deal, so if I become a hypocrite in this review, feel free to call me out on it...lol.    After a long trek through the Broad Acres Swap Meet in North Las Vegas, we figured we may as well keep it real and conclude the adventure with some good Mexican grub.  Our menu consisted of white fish ceviche de oescado, carne zarandeade, pulpitos a la mantequilla, botana mixta, cerveza preparada and horchata, all of which made me excited and added to the suspense.    I was told that there is a live mariachi band, but none in sight when we arrived.  It can get pretty sporty and didn't know how I felt about not hearing myself chew today, so okay with the blasting Mexican music.  But I spoke too soon, in came the band and jammed at a table till we departed.  Soon afterward a dude came by suited and booted selling chocolate bars followed by a guy slangin rosaries.  The place is pretty authentic in my book.  Sometimes I feel that the great finds not always have the highest Yelp review, but less in this case and is a diamond in the rough.  The michiladas were on point and splashed with fish juice even, now if that ain't authentic, I dint know what is.    I have to give the overall experience a 4 since its just what the doctor ordered...a great day at the Mexican swap meet followed by some good Mexican food.  I hope that my follow up visits will be just as entertaining.  Next time, I plan to have the pescado zarandeade and will provide you all with the scoops on that."}
{"text":"Unfortunate it made me select a star, if it was for me I wouldn't have selected anything. Had to send back my food numerous times because of an allergy & these people didn't even care. Thought I was dumb enough to not notice that all they did was pick out what I was allergic too. Server, by the name of Chuy, was absolutely ignorant & careless that a lawsuit is coming their way due to my allergic reaction afterwards. Thank you lovely establishment for showing me that people don't care about what happens to others."}
{"text":"This place is okay... Definitely horrible service. We walked in & seated ourselves. Took about 10 minutes to get acknowledged by the waitress, then about another 10 minutes to get the drinks. Finally she took our order and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time.   We ordered the shrimp cocktail & the aguachiles. The aguachiles was good, however this place is pretty expensive. I'm not sure what the market prices are for shrimp, but this place is no bargain.   I will say their preparadas (beer with a combination of some shrimp juice) were 5 stars. Really tasty.   Perhaps I'll return, but if I don't it won't be the end of the world."}
{"text":"I am just rating on the vibe of this place. I came here a week ago to accompany my parents for their early dinner. It was my first time coming in here and I must say that I loved the atmosphere. The decorations and the vibrant colors this place has to offer are just energetic. The music is just about right noise wise; we were all able to talk without having to yell at each other. & most importantly, the place was full. By the time we left there was a line forming. I would like to come here again and try their food because my parents have raved about it so it must be good."}
