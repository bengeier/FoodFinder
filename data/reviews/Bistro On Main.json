{"text":"My best friend invited a very large group of friends and family here to celebrate a very special occasion.  They were accommodating, but because of the size of our party, we were not allowed access to the full menu.  My friend had to select appetizers, a salad, entrees, and desserts ahead of time for a special menu, only for us.  Possibly practical on the part of the restaurant, but honestly, having to plan a menu was just another worry for my friend as he scrambled to get the more important details together for the rest of his event.

We'd reserved the back party room, but for some reason they'd separated the tables so only four of us could sit together, like at a wedding reception (the menu, the seating arrangement...maybe they really thought we were having a wedding reception?).  We had one waitress for all 15-20 of us -- a bad decision on the restaurant's part, I think it really diminished the quality of the service we got.  But what do I know, maybe they were unexpectedly understaffed that night?

Given the awkward seating, we asked the waitress and the busboy-possibly-another-waiter if we could combine our tables so there would be two groups of us instead of five, and so we could easily talk with each other.  The busboy-possibly-waiter was totally on board with it, but the waitress told us, waving her hand, she had to (paraphrasing) \"get the drink orders first, I can't even do that, ask him\" (referring to the busboy-possibly-waiter).  So we all helped him move tables as she flounced out of the room.

The attitude continued throughout the dinner.  I asked for a pink squirrel to drink, and even gave her the ingredients -- creme de noyaux, creme de cacao, and cream.  I let her know she could sub out amaretto for the creme de noyaux, since I know it's rare to find that one in a bar.  She came back to tell me they didn't have one of the ingredients.  Really?  You don't have cream, some kind of chocolate liqueur, and amaretto?  The dive bar down the street from me has all of those things. I asked which one she was missing, thinking I could sub something else out -- she wasn't sure, said they'd found another recipe for it that 1) included ice cream, which they didn't have, and 2) wouldn't taste good with the amaretto.  Ok... but 1) that's not what I asked for, and 2) I'm ordering the drink this way because I've had it made this way before, and it tastes fine to me.  I brushed it off and ordered a glass of pinot grigio.  Meanwhile, one of my girlfriends had to ask three times for her drink.

I'll admit we were a little rowdy, but we were in a closed-off room and celebrating.  I couldn't hear our group in the main dining room as I waited in line for the restroom, so I don't *think* we were disturbing the other customers.  Everyone out there looked happy.  But I heard reports from our group that the waitress kept rolling her eyes.  I didn't see her do that, but she was pretty brusque with my table.  I'm really not trying to get anyone in trouble, I know it's very hard to serve a large party, especially when there's alcohol involved.  Just sayin', a smile goes a long, long way.

My food, thankfully, was much better than the service, although my best friend and his family all agreed their meat was really dry.  I ordered the spinach linguine with scallops, and it was really good.  It was light, but filling, and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  I was worried because linguine tends to be one of those noodles that gets overcooked really easily, turning to mush -- but these were perfect.  I applauded the lobster and salmon egg roll appetizers, too.  The wedge salad I ordered was, eh, a wedge salad. 

In total, we were there just over two hours -- not bad for a big group like that in a fancier place.  While it wasn't the best experience I've had at a nice restaurant, I'm guessing the size of our party had a lot to do with it.  It'd be nice to go back with just a few people, or on a date, to see what it's like then.  Everyone deserves a second chance, I guess."}
{"text":"Update to previous review: 

Okay, so we ventured out on a Saturday night, outside of our regular Cheap Date Night. :)  I gotta say - everything was great. The food was delicious, service was on point, and damn - those brussels sprouts. Wow. 

Also, the bad reviews? You'll note most of them tried using a coupon of some sort. I work at another local restaurant and have the same experience with these people.  Cheap and impossible to please.  Want \"no pink\" in your steak? Order it well done, no char.  Sheesh."}
{"text":"Poor service and waited over an hour for lunch item. Didn't end up eating bc chef burnt it too."}
{"text":"I tried Bistro on Main by recommendation but will not be going back.  My wife's chicken arrived undercooked and pink.  When thoroughly cooked, it was tough. The dishes had great presentaion but a little bland for my taste.  We had a drink while waiting for our food, they cleared the empty's and never offered to sell us another.  To top it off I tried to use a groupon but couldn't  because of the fine print I missed.  I sent the manager an email (via their website) 5 days ago describing our experience and got no response.  I rarely leave negative feedback but this was a very disappointing experience.  I plan to scrap the groupon and move on."}
{"text":"I had scallops with linguine.  The scallops were huge and delicious.  I was with Eric L. who reviewed just before this review.  Their pear salad was really good as well.  I had the carrot cake for dessert.  It was very moist and the berry sauce that went with it was surprisingly nice!

I definitely recommend this place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Been going to BOM for probably 10 years now and counting. It's our go to place when our family gets together. There are plenty of options on the menu for everyone from burgers to a sizable New York strip. The specials we opt to select as they are consistently different and delicious. Some of our favorites at BOM include: their martini selections,
BOM signature salad, roasted Brussels sprouts, plantain chips appetizer, gourmet pizza is like none other, salmon - should I go on?  You get the idea. The food is great. Staff is knowledgeable and knows all the food selections and what is in each offering. They actually go through taste testing of every item on the menu so that they are fully prepared to describe each dish!  Great atmosphere inside the bar as well as in the main dining room. The addition of the patio is nice too for a more informal dining option which is heated too.  Reservations are highly recommended as with all great restaurants, they fill up no matter what might of the week!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at the bistro for several years.  The food is always consistent and good and their wine list is extensive.  Specifically, their hamburgers and fries are the best I have tasted in Portage County.   The waiters and waitresses are almost always professional and attentive.  The only thing I would ask the chef to do would be to update the menu more often (but keep the classics).  The parking lot is sometimes crazy, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"What was most impressive was our first server's display of unprofessionalism. We had an email from the Bistro stating their adjusted deals from being closed Memorial Day and he was trying to tell us that we were wrong, finally agreed to take our drink order, huffed and then said he would find us another server and stormed off. Our new server came over and was friendly and actually knew about the specials. Food was great! Bald headed server should take tips from his coworkers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the bar last night for dinner around 7. We both had the specials - strip steak for him and mahi for me. Both were excellent!  I am thrilled to have that quality of food so close to home. The staff was attentive and friendly but there was a lot going on behind the bar.  Always 3 or 4 people and it appeared chaotic most of the time. The noise level in the lounge was high. It was busy, which was great, but it was loud. Overall, a busy place with outstanding food. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We celebrated my mother in law's birthday here. We had a group of seven that they accommodated with ease. Jake (if I remember correctly) was our waiter. He was great. Special requests, food allergies, and many questions were present and he easily tackled everything the party could throw at him. All of the food was perfectly prepared from steak to scallops.

I'm struggling to think of another dining experience that I have had that comes close to this one. 

All of this combined help to make a very happy birthday girl. The only regret I have is not trying the Bistro sooner."}
{"text":"After passing this restaurant several times I finally decided to visit one evening. I was very impressed. Great service, food, and and an outstanding drink menu. The service was great and not pushy. We went late in the evening on a Saturday and felt no pressure hurry up and rush. It wasn't cheap but well worth another visit or two from me."}
{"text":"I was there a few weeks ago with a large group. it was about 24 of us. The service was great. What I was most impressed with is, when my food came out, it was piping hot. I have never experienced that is a large group. In some cases your luck to get your food hot when its four people sitting at a table... Everything was correct as well. 

I enjoyed the food, the atmosphere & the service I will definitely go back to Bistro on Main."}
{"text":"Ok, so after getting two \"compliments\" from Aaron R. (who hasn't reviewed anything) calling me a \"jerk\" for not liking what's apparently his favorite place, I gave it another try.  Just kidding - although he really did feel the need to insult me twice about my original review, the only thing that got me to try it again was a Groupon for $20 off.  So we made our reservation, and off we went on a Saturday night in January.  Now, the atmosphere was a lot more fitting - it was cold and dark outside, so being warm and dark inside seemed fine.  We were seated in nearly the same seats as our previous visit, squeezed between a table for 4 and a table of 2.  I ordered one of their specialty martinis, and it was very good.  Things seemed to be looking up.  We were already having a more favorable impression.  But... the menu, which supposed changes often?  Looked about the same as it was when we last went in August 2009.  And service was friendly, but sloooow - we are normal-paced eaters, but our meal here took nearly 2 hours.  

As for food...We shared a Pear & Hazelnut salad to start... which came with cubes of apple, not pear.  (Shouldn't they have told us they were making substitutions?  It didn't really go with the rest of the salad.)  I ordered an entree special, local lamb T-bones which were absolutely delicious.  Seriously delicious.  They were served with potatoes gratin, and green beans.  Sounds good, right?  Well, each thing on its own was fine - but together it was one big grease bomb.  The green beans were coated in oil, and sauteed or roasted until soft.  The gratin was tasty but very greasy, the gratin dish had about 1/4 inch of oil in the bottom, no joke.  Portions were generous, overly so - I ate about half of everything.  My husband had the pork tenderloin, which was fine, but not outstanding - and came with the same green beans, and yams instead of gratin.  

We ordered dessert too, a small chocolate pot-de-creme (fine) and one of the specials, a white cake with strawberry something-or-other (too cold and not the birthday-cake-type thing we envisioned from the description.)  The coffee and espresso were terrible, but that's not unusual around here.

But here's the thing about this place: if you're going to pay that kind of money for dinner for 2 (over $100) you want to feel like you're getting a certain level of service and quality of meal.  This place just doesn't meet those standards.  Sure, the food is fine, the staff are nice... but I've had better food at Cajun Dave's, for a lot less.  (Albeit in a bar setting!)  I've had better food and better atmosphere and service at Crave or Vegiterranean in Akron, or at Moe's in Cuyahoga Falls, for the same price.  The Bistro might want to take a closer look at some of its competitors and learn a thing or two.  I'd love having a world-class restaurant in Kent, but this is not it."}
{"text":"What a great little gem tucked away in Kent, Ohio!  My wife and I dined here and had a phenomenal experience.  My wife is a very picky eater too.  Great service and amazing food.  They custom made my wife's' dish for her.  I had the shrimp and salmon egg rolls with the 1/2 Ohio farm raised chicken.  Great beer selections too."}
{"text":"The restaurant food food was a little unique, they had the weirdest combinations for examples they put seafood in Mac and cheese, and in my option that's a little weird but it did taste good. 

We had to wait FOREVER for our food and there were only 3 tables. (including us) the staff was nice and didn't constantly check up on us. Overall the experience was good"}
{"text":"This is the worst meal I have ever had.  The caesar salad was so full of hot pepper it ruined it.  I ordered the snapper which also was so embroiled with hot pepper as to render it inedible.  Very disappointing,."}
{"text":"Had been at BOM for retail wine night with appetizers, but only recently for dinner.  Red Sangria was delicious but expensive at $10/glass.  The house made bread was good, but rather heavy & greasy for a pre-meal bonus.  Hubby & I ordered an appetizer of asparagus breadsticks with a jalapeño white cheddar sauce. It took quite awhile to get these and they were just OK.  The dipping sauce was tasteless with no heat whatsoever (what jalapeño?) and some of the asparagus still had the woody ends which were not edible.  Dinner was a pepperoni chorizo sausage pizza for hubby & the vegetable linguini for me.  I added the rock shrimp to my dish & that wasn't a problem.  We wanted to try the adult Mac n cheese, but the server checked with the kitchen and they would not allow us to order as a side dish.  Husband loved his pizza (and ate nearly the whole thing himself!) and while my pasta had good flavor, the linguini was definitely over cooked.  The texture was far from al dente and they had cut up all of the noodles rather than leaving them long.  We split the pot de creme dessert, which was a fancy way of saying chocolate mousse.  It was served very cold which lead me to believe if was all prepared earlier & put in a cooler.  It was very tasty and was served with a delicious homemade chocolate crumbly cookie.  All in all, BOM was an OK dining experience and we may return to give it another try but we're certainly not in any rush to do so."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer service marred an otherwise mediocre experience. 
My girl friend and I went as a date, we expected top quality service for the money we were paying however we received anything but. The server whose name I forgot (a bald middle aged white male) was rude and highly unprofessional. He was very terse, would not answer our questions and seemed annoyed with us for no reason whatsoever. I ordered a hamburger and my girl friend ordered some espresso gelato. The gelato was horrible and tasted more like old chocolate ice cream with freezer burn. The hamburger was very boring and tasted like something I could have ordered for much less money from someplace like \"the rail\" in akron or \"flip side\" in hudson (both of which I highly recommend). To top off the negative experience the rude waiter charged us incorrectly for the gelato. It said on the menu that it was 3$ which I already thought was too much for such poor quality gelato but he charged me 5.50 which was simply outrageous. I told him about the error and he simply wouldn't budge saying that he \"thought I meant the larger portion\" despite that fact we only had ONE scoop of gelato. He would not offer to correct the mistake and would not even try to accomodate me, simply walked off with my credit card and charged me anyway. I was highly upset and left the bistro on main feeling disgruntled and unhappy. DO NOT eat hear if you expect any semblance of customer service or quality food. Worst eating experience I've had in Ohio."}
{"text":"This was a group office luncheon in which most everyone ordered and were happy with some great looking burgers. We had the crab dip to start and it was served with some delightful bread. Huge chunks of crab were in the dip that was so creamy, I wanted to scoop it out myself and not share! I had the Cesar salad w/ seared scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The only thing lacking was the dressing for the salad - a little on the light side as in not much was put on as it's mixed with bread crumbs that are absolutely delectable. No complaints though. 

We sat on their exterior enclosed patio that's heated. It was quite nice. Inside was a bit loud and the weather, despite being a rainy dreary day was comfortable enough to sit outside. 

I will return for more!"}
{"text":"We went last night for a \"night out\" without the kids. Amazing food with a quiet atmosphere. Service is a little slow but is well worth the wait. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the wedge salad was fantastic. A great place for local upscale dining but, I wouldn't recommend bringing young children. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is the last time I give Bistro On Main my business. Ordered food at 12:25, finally got salad after 15 minutes, then almost 25 minutes for main meal. It's a lovely place, but awful service.

Waitress never filled up my water class, didn't tell me 'sorry it's taking so long', plus there were only 5 other tables being served. 

I don't know how the owner tolerates this. I took my husband for a week day lunch, and it took over 1 1/2 hours. Not acceptable on a weekday when most folks are working. I thought perhaps they would have better service today...NOT!

Menu is lovely, food not good, soup had not taste, pizza was not cooked long enough! Leaving it with a wet soggy crust.

Good Luck Bistro...get your act together."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was warm and inviting, server was wonderful and gave good suggestions for drinks. That's the good, the not so good is the meal I ordered. The meat was tender and presentation was nice but the Demi-glace was acidic and I was unable to eat much of it. I will definitely give this place another try sometime, but I'll be ordering more carefully."}
{"text":"TUESDAY SALAD SPECIAL!

I'll get right to the point and say that the Salads are pretty amazing, and the half price special on Tuesday makes it downright irresistible. Seriously,  if you have an open Tuesday evening, you should check this place out. But really, the happy hour special on the apps will give you access to the undeniably delicious coffee rubbed wings, (i too though it was a bit strange at first, but trust me, they're awesome) for a bargain price.

The seating is cozy, so you may want to leave the really loud members of your crew out for this one. Otherwise, I think it's a perfect place for a small group or a date."}
{"text":"I recently went here for a friends birthday party, we don't have anything like this back home so I didn't realize how fancy it is and felt out of place. Service was okay but they made my friends  food wrong and burnt another guest dessert."}
{"text":"Decided to give Bistro a try and am glad I did.   We used a Groupon and had a lovely meal for a very reasonable price.   The baby blue salad was excellent...  I wanted to lick the bowl.   I had the sweet potato gnocchi with pulled pork...  Sweet,  spicy, creamy goodness.   My date had the the pork chop which was HUGE,  and perfectly cooked.    Cocktails were also tasty and we finished off with the creme brulee duo (which was very  good but to small).   We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went to Bistro on Main on Saturday to celebrate a graduation.  It took a full hour after ordering before receiving our food.  There were significant problems with 4 of the 8 orders.  Two arrived barely warm, one had a cold side dish, and one person's pizza had been sitting under the warmer for so long that the server brought two pizzas out at the same time - the original, warmed one and another that had come out of the oven more recently.

The menu is interesting and the food that arrived hot was tasty.  The manager did take some steps to \"make it right\", but since a grad school graduation is a once in a lifetime event it felt like too little, too late."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Kent. I've never had anything bad. Burgers are fine meat, and $5 price on Monday is a steal. Strip steak pops up only as a special, but is as good as any in area."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago thanks to a friend making a great recommendation! Our table of 4 walked out very happy with our meals and service! We sat in the bar area and our server was very attentive and friendly! The portions are great and the food was cooked perfectly.
To start, the plantain nachos and brussel sprouts are amazing!! I ordered the salmon entree and it was delicious! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Worth every penny. We had a group outing of 16 people here...ambiance provided by a gas fireplace in a special room; spacious, warm, comfortable, and waited on attentively by an amazingly accommodating staff. 

Giant pork chops cooked to perfection with vegetables paired, and presented with a culinary prowess not seen in many restaurants locally. These guys know what they are doing in every aspect from the skills employed in the crafting of a seasonal spin on a 'Moscow mule' to the flavorfully captivating foccatia bread served prior. 

My wife ordered short ribs and had the bones removed. I realize that is a tall order, but these folks made it happen. Other guests ordered unique dishes such as quail and baked grapes. You just don't see such treats like that every day. 

Every aspect from wait staff to fork was satisfaction on a major level."}
{"text":"We have been to many restaurants in northeast Ohio and there have been only a few which were outstanding and worth recommending. Bistro on Main was excellent. I had the sweet potato gnocchi with spinach and portabella mushrooms. Great wine, salad, appetizer and main course. We will be regulars here. Loved it."}
{"text":"In Kent, the options for eating out are limited. While The Bistro represents itself as a first rate dining experience, I beg to differ. I have eaten at the restaurant many times over a three year period, and my major finding is wide variation in food quality. You go one time, and every selection is well prepared and tasty. The next time you go, either the dipping bread is stale and the oil bland, the salad is off kilter, or the main dish is adequate, but not at the level you enjoyed previously.To me, a highly rated restaurant delivers first class food on a consistent basis. The Bistro does not do this. Hence, I'll be looking elsewhere my my dining arrangements."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here at Bistro On Main is an ambient one, making it a perfect place for a fine dinner. I look forward to visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Recently hosted a dinner meeting for a group of doctors. Everything was taken care of and set up prior to showing up. Very simple. No issues with getting computer hooked up to speakers and projector etc. 
After people started arriving about 45 minutes early, the staff was on top of it and took care of them as if it was the original proposed start time. Staff was very attentive and present, but not over bearing. 
We had a predetermined menu for the evening. Scallops and risotto and the plantain nachos for appetizers. Amazing! Docs loved them both. Main course was a basil and vegetable pasta, smoked and braised brisket, or chicken and potatoes. All were amazing! I recommend the smoked brisket. For dessert it was creme brûlée or a cheesecake. 
Everything up to par here, from convenience for a private event, attentive service, and quality food. Would recommend for anyone hosting a private event."}
{"text":"I have been to Bistro on Main a few times over the last ten years. Each time I have had great service and the food has been fabulous! Last night I took a friend for a girls night out, and we had another wonderful experience. 

Alcohol- There is a full bar available, and one full side of the place-mat sized menu is use for beer, wine, and other alcoholic beverages.  I didn't get past the red wines so I can't speak of the quality of the beer options.  Tuesday night is 'Half price Wine by the Bottle\" night and we took advantage, ordering two bottles of reds that normally are well above our 10/bottle Grocery store purchases. Our waiter was well informed on the (simple but sufficient) wine list and provided excellent recommendations. Our first bottle was served with a slight delay on our 'Kitchen Plate\" of cheeses and nuts but we enjoyed getting to know the wine with no other distractions. The second bottle arrived with our entrees and we may have broken our rule by leaving a little in the bottle to assure our sobriety when we left. Both dry, complex reds made us swoon with the first heady sip. ahhhhhh...

Service - We arrived to a packed parking lot, just after 7pm, without a reservation, and were seated in a few minutes.  Because we wanted to to enjoy our wine and dinner, we took our time, holding a table in a busy restaurant from our 7pm seating until they closed at 9:30. We never felt rushed and our waiter encouraged us to linger over the wine and food, adding desserts and coffee to tie up the evening. The kitchen was hopping but we were a little disappointing in the delay between the kitchen plate and our bottle of wine (thus one star is knocked off) and generally felt the course were served a little off in the timing. I think this is due to the kitchen processes rather than slow service on the part of our waiter.

Atmosphere - The bar and lounge area is small, nicely decorated, and perfect for a dinner or just drinks and appetizers. I've eaten there in the past with my in-laws, and we all enjoyed the feel of the place. Last night we were seated in the main dining room, which is decorated in dark woods, browns and burgundy with lighter (Yellow?) walls. The tables are bare wood, and the silverware is wrapped in a white cloth napkin. It's not a quiet room, but not overly loud, totally fine for business discussions and also nice for a date night.

Food- Every course was beautifully prepared, not crazy plate art but definitely thoughtfully presented and attractive. The food is upscale, often locally sourced, and the preparation reminds me of Napa style or Tuscany.  Last night we both ordered pork dishes because I only eat pork when it's been farm raised, outdoors, on pasture with lots of fresh air and sunshine. You can truly taste the difference from the bland, mushy factory farm pork (I avoid it for it's lack of flavor and cruel conditions). The special was the pork shank (pictured) which was literally falling off the bone tender and melted in your mouth.  The pork chop, thick cut and cooked to the chefs preference (medium rare) was moist and tender, especially for a pig who spent it's time moving about, and packed with the rich flavor only pastured pork can provide.

In addition to the Kitchen Plate, and pork entrees we also ordered a pizza (half price on Tuesdays) which we split as a second course, and we couldn't decide on our dessert - the banana bread pudding or the peanut butter and chocolate mouse. After a few nanoseconds of thought we ordered both, along with coffee. OMG SO GOOD!

I am not going to wait so long before I return, but due to my limited funds, I will probably stick to wine and pizzas and Tuesday nights!"}
{"text":"Nice art, upbeat music and dim lighting gives this spot a nice touch of youth.

Our server was very pleasant but service was disjointed.  Our waitress was gone for about 30-40 minutes.  Our order was delivered by I think the kitchen.  The mac and cheese was mostly onion too much to finish the dish.  The pizza had a great simple crunchy crust I really enjoyed.  The pictures are accurate, they do a great job with presentation."}
{"text":"The Bistro is our favorite places to go. The food is great and the service is professional and fitting for the type of upscale food that is served. We have never been disappointed...maybe a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"late night dinner on Monday. Walked in right before and asks if kitchen was open, bartender was friendly and sat us at a table. Our server informed of us daily burger special and I ordered it while my date orders the crab cake sandwich. Food came out quickly (we were one of the last on the restaurant) and look good. However once we began eating it was apparent  that the food had been rushed out in order to close the kitchen. Burger that was asked to be medium was well done and burned around the edges, fries were cold. the crab sandwich lacked any good flavor according to my date. Nevertheless the atmosphere ad service was great however the food didn't live up to all the hype I had heard about this place. we will prolly come back and give it another try, maybe it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"Awful service from start to finish. Entered and waited as there wasn't anyone at the hostess station. Wandered back to bar and there were more staff than customers in the bar. I was finally then able to be seated. This was a bad sign to start and it did not improve. The waiter stopped once to ask for drinks and then did not make another appearance for about 30 min. We needed to prompt the waiter to hear the specials and he did not really know these as he fumbled through the two main course specials. We ordered the fish special, mahi mahi. This was over cooked and the bacon in the dish overwhelmed the fish. Then the dish had potatoes, sweet potato and several greens roasted without much seasoning. This did not seem to be well composed. To add to the insult, my girlfriend ask for the check and the waiter then put the check in front of the largest guy in our group. The waiter focused on him for almost the entire evening and then could not even figure out that my girlfriend was going to be paying after she asked for the bill. Overall this was a largely disappointing experience and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Bistro. There was nothing specially unique, but nothing disappointing either. Food was very good, service was excellent and friendly. The main reason I gave it 4 was that the place was not as clean as I expect. The plates on our table were obviously not same-day washed, and there were obvious stains on people's uniform. Still I had a good night and can recommend this place."}
{"text":"I seriously never expected to find a decent place to eat in Kent, OH.  Nearly every restaurant in Kent is either fast food or mediocre.  The joys of living in a college town.

The boyfriend and I paid Bistro on Main a visit since they offer a \"Cheap Date Night\" on Wednesdays.  You get a bottle of wine, two salads, an entree, and dessert for $35.  Being poor graduate students, this offer lured us in.  However, the Cheap Date Night menu didn't exactly suit our fancy, so we opted for a regular meal instead.

A friend of ours absolutely raves about Bistro's 'hooked up' grilled cheese.  Cheese is one of my favorite foods (second only to peanut butter), so I had to give this a try.  The sandwich is comprised of toasted focaccia bread with cheddar, boursin-chevre, and provolone cheese, roasted peppers, Roma tomatoes fresh basil and chives.  Wowza.  It was perhaps the best grilled cheese sandwich I have ever had (take that, Melt!).  The flavors complimented one another marvelously.  As a side I chose their rosemary fries (another favorite food) and was disappointed to hear they were out of rosemary (seriously...how do you run out of rosemary when you serve rosemary fries!?  Get it together, Bistro!).  Without the rosemary, the fries were nothing special.

The boyfriend opted for the \"Adult\" Macaroni and Cheese which has Atlantic lobster and chorizo sausage, roasted banana peppers & onions, white cheddar cream, and crispy spinach.  He was in love with his dish.  He only ordered the side portion and it was still huge.  I'm afraid to know how large the full portion is.  

As an added bonus, Bistro offers great discounts if you sign up for their mailing list.  They'll send coupons for your birthday, your spouse's birthday, and your anniversary.  Not a bad perk.  Our waitress advised us to lie about the dates and spread them out so we'd get a nice coupon every few months.

Service was excellent and the atmosphere is nice without being overly stuffy.  Highly recommend as a destination of you're looking to eat something halfway decent in the area."}
{"text":"A big negative is that there is only one handicapped parking spot! A second one would be that what is listed on their website lunch menu isn't what's available in the restaurant. I was looking forward to the Cheese Steak Sandwich and my friend wanted to get the Beef Brisket Sandwich, but neither are still on the menu. We both settled on a chicken salad sandwich with potato salad ($11.50), along with a glass of chardonnay ($6.00). A bit pricey for what we got for lunch."}
{"text":"Came for the first time on a Wednesday night - love the cheap date special! Bottle of wine, salads and pizza for $35!! Great service and flavour!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the afternoon at Bistro. Food and wine selections were great !! The ambience is very nice. Enjoyed the dinning experience at the bar. Thanks to a great service by Katie and Tony. Would most definitely recommend this place. 
Thx

{"text":"I made reservations for 7 p.m., and we arrived on time, only to hear from the hostess that she could not find our reservations.  When I informed her that I had made them through their website (they use \"Seat Me\") she told us that they don't use that anymore, but that she could probably seat us. First of all, If you don't use a service anymore that is listed on your website, maybe you should call your webmaster and make it unavailable?!  Secondly, wouldn't an apology have been in order?  We were seated at what seemed like a nice table.  Our server was no where to be found.  When she did arrive, she took our drink orders and disappeared again.  It took an age for our drinks to be served.  When we asked about the specials,  she literally read from her notes, and gave very little detail.  There were two rather uncomplicated specials.  A good server, in my opinion, is familiar with the menu and can describe each dish well.  We asked about a mussel and clam appetizer, which she described as a stew.  When it arrived (almost 30 minutes later), it was nothing like a stew.  It did have a nice taste, but we really expected more broth with a dish like that.  The portion was also very skimpy.  We had to wait another 40 minutes for our entrees (in the meantime our appetizer plates were not cleared).  The food was cold.  And so were we.  There was a horrible draft in the  restaurant, and every time the door opened a gust of cold air came in.  After flagging down our server (shouldn't she have checked on us to make sure everything was fine?), we did receive an apology and our entrees were taken back to the kitchen.  Another 15 agonizing minutes went by until our entrees appeared.  My steak was ok, the garlic mashed potatoes nothing special.  My husband's pasta was tasteless.  While we were eating the chef/owner stopped by to give us a disingenuous apology and told us that dessert was on the house.  We did not want to stick around for dessert (how long would that have taken?!), so we politely told our server that we were ready for our check.  The chef/owner came over again, this time with a $10 gift card for our next visit.  It will not be used."}
{"text":"We walked in later on a Friday evening, not very busy at all. Half empty parking lot. 2 servers walked to the front, looked at us, and completely ignored us. We waited to be seated for 10 minutes. Didn't know I was wearing an invisibility cloak."}
{"text":"Bistro on Main is our go-to date spot! The service is always fantastic, and the food and drinks are shockingly high quality for the area. It's very relaxing as soon as you walk in, and I've always felt welcome to take my time, which is refreshing. 

We're usually drinks and appetizers kind of diners, but we've tried their pizza as well, and everything is delicious. Plantain nachos are always a favorite, and their daily scallop preparation is melt-in-your-mouth delicious every time. As far as drinks go, we tend to stick to their wine list (pretty good), but their rotating cocktail menu usually has something intriguing. They had a Rosemary pomegranate cocktail a while back that I loved. But there's always lots to try, and their daily specials offer new items and they have a decent happy hour as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The appetizers are all tasty. The ribeye is always flavorful and cooked perfectly. Only rating it 4 stars because they don't have the ribeye on special often."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Bistro on Main for several years now. What was once a place where you could count on consistently well-prepared food has turned into a fairly pretentious eatery where quality control simply doesn't exist. I feel it would be struggling if it weren't the only restaurant in Kent where pretentious people could go while convincing themselves they're getting a better dining experience than they actually are.

Don't get me wrong, sometimes the food is not too bad. Things tend to be properly cooked (for the most part) and nicely presented, but the disappointment comes when the food hits your taste buds. The food seems to be terribly under-seasoned. It's like they're trying to save money by not using salt or other seasonings. And then they are arrogant enough to not even provide salt or pepper at your table! My girlfriend joked that next time we should bring in some salt and pepper packets from Wendy's and I said that we could also pass them out to the other diners and tell them, \"You're going to need this!\". 

Last night I ordered the flank steak with mashed potatoes, green beans and pork belly (for the 2nd time in the last few months). The steak, potatoes and green beans literally tasted like they had no salt or pepper at all! The potatoes were fairly garlicky, but just really bland overall. The pork belly was the shining star- perfectly cooked and seasoned, but it was too little, too late.

The same can be said for their \"Bistro Burger\" (only $5 on Mondays). The burger is topped with bleu cheese and served with rosemary-garlic fries. Sounds good, right? I thought so, too. Once again, it's like they took a wad of ground beef and slapped it on the grill without a grain of seasoning. The burger is also fairly large, so the cheese and condiments do little to carry their flavor all the way through. The fries are good, depending on how they feel that day about actually giving you any garlic or rosemary. Once again, the menu promises one thing and you get another.

Another quality control issue: A few weeks back I ordered the honey creme brulee for dessert. When it came out, the sugar on top was completely charred! I realize that it's supposed to have areas of \"burn\", but this was literally black, and covered the majority of the surface, making the dish overwhelmingly bitter. I sent it back and when the server brought the replacement she said that yes, it was obviously burnt and apologized. So, why was it sent out in the first place, if you could tell that just by looking at it?! Arg! (this was the same server that when I ordered the braised short rib special asked me how I'd like it done...yeah, I usually order my braised beef cooked medium. The dish was also so bland, it tasted like horribly underseasoned pot roast). The replacement dessert was absolutely delicious, with just the right amount of sweetness and a subtle honey flavor. 

In conclusion, I wish the Bistro would just be what it advertises. It's a shame that the people in Kent have such low standards that they think this is the best it gets. Hopefully the management can take a step back, ACTUALLY TASTE THEIR OWN FOOD, and see that if they made some actually quite minor changes, they could live up to their own expectations.
If I could rate with 2.5 stars, that would be more accurate."}
{"text":"Great place to have a great dinner. Wednesday is cheap date night for drinks, salad, and pizza! What a great wait staff and dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a graduation dinner and it was okay. It's certainly the type of place that acts much more pretentious than its truly worth. Dark, drab interior. Waiter was some balding man child who barely listened, persuaded some to get different meals based off his preferences, and inserted himself needlessly into conversation. Very rude, hateful person. Some appetizers were very bad like breaded asparagus (grilled asparagus is clearly superior). However there were some standouts- chicken wings, drinks, and some entrees were quite good. Nothing too imaginative happening in the kitchen but it will make whatever old uncle you haven't seen in years happy when he is there for your inevitable graduation dinner. It was fine but I probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Real, creative, seasonal food done perfectly. Great for an adult dinner out. Excellent wine options and fantastic desserts.  So nice to have an upscale  restaurant like this in Kent/Stow!!  We had great service that was nicely paced -- not rushed and not too slow."}
{"text":"This is one of the most romantic restaurants in the Akron area!  My boyfriend and I went here for the first time on Friday night. We were seated in the dining room - the ambience is spectacular and the restaurant has a very hip feel to it.  The wine list is varied and reasonably priced.  Our server Joie could not have been better - she didn't hover over us but kept an eye on us.  We had a crab-stuffed portabello mushroom appetizer that was amazing!  My boyfriend had the strip steak special with garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini (delish!)  I had the pork chop with the sweet potato hash which was done perfectly.  Our desserts were tasty and presented beautifully in 3 drunken-martini glasses in an iron stand at our table.  Everyone in the resaurant was kind and friendly - including our neighboring diners.  Overall this was one of our most memorable dining experiences!  We highly recommend the Bistro on Main."}
{"text":"First time there tonight. Just stopped in for takeout.  Excellent pulled pork sandwiches.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim after shopping on a Wednesday Night.....the couples night deal is amazing!  I highly recommend the green onion mac and cheese and the fantastic salad with berries and nuts.  They have a great deal for gift cards is you buy $100 you get $10 off a visit every month of the year. We will definitely be going back.  Make sure to see Tony in the bar, Top Notch!!!!!  That was our first visit and he was so patient and helpful. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Bistro on Main is a very classy place! it is pricey, but worth every penny.... from what we hear, the menu changes frequently adding things from places that the owner has traveled. It makes it hard to decide what to go with since a lot of the food is something you would never find around here. The atmosphere is very inviting... perfect for a romantic dinner, special occasion, or a great place to take friends. The staff has always been more than friendly, and can answer any questions that you would have about their menu."}
{"text":"Mon night we walk in at 630 and asked if we had a reservation. Um....no. We peaked around the corner and saw the bar wide - we sat at a 2 seat high top (which was not offered to us at all). Went for the $6 sammy night. A burger, chix sandwich, 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers was $36. But THAT burger was one of the TOP 5 best burgers I have ever, ever had. We'll go back for the burgers some other stuff that came out that looked awesome but BOM....tone down the pretention..."}
{"text":"Bistro on Main is, by far the best restaurant in the Kent area.  We visit every year from Orange County, CA and we are sure to get at least one meal in at Bistro.  If you're looking for real gourmet/fine dining in the area, this is the place to go!  Everything we have had is very tasty and original....the menu is a bit seasonal so you may not find everything below at all times of year but that's great because they only like to use fresh ingredients...some of our favorites are...

1.  Grilled avocado salad with watermelon, mango, and red onion
2.  Wild caught scallops with arugula and orzo
3.  Short rib - fall apart, very tender - served with mixed veggies
4.  Their regular house salad  - a mix of fresh greens, candied walnuts, feta cheese, onion etc...you can add your protein of choice if you choose
5.  Flank steak over beans with grilled green onions and bell pepper
6.  Pork chop with sweet potato mash, applewood smoked bacon and spinach

Good wines....reasonable prices considering the high quality of food.  We have always had great service as well."}
{"text":"Went to Bistro for lunch with a church group. The atmosphere was very nice and the staff very attentive but not over bearing. Most of our group ordered the burgers and they appeared to enjoy them. My wife and I not being big eaters ordered appetizers for our meal. BIG mistake! She ordered the plantain nachos and I got the scallops on rice. Even though the wait staff were attentive when there, the wait time was very long. The nachos when they arrived had some sickening green something poured over the plantains along with some crumbled bacon. The bacon was the only tasty part of it. My scallops were very good, the rice they were sitting on, not so good. The biggest objection to the dish was 'rice and two scallops' for $13. Our bill came to $27 our only beverage was one coffee (bad) and water. Way way over priced unless you are getting billed for the atmosphere. Will we be back? Very doubtful!"}
{"text":"There are not enough amazing things to say about this place! The food was phenomenal and the service was exceptional! Our server Josh was so attentive and went above and beyond to take care of everything we needed. The owner even stopped over to our table for a quick chat. The ambiance couldn't be more perfect. The lighting was very intimate and cozy. Also: ASK for the homemade sriracha oil. It was so delicious! I will be back over and over again. What a hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"This is THE best restaurant in Kent, Ohio. Their food is off the chain. I purposely signed up for their mailing list, and I actually read the emails. That's how you know it's good. 

My boyfriend and I come here once a month for date night (it's pretty pricy and we are just lowly grad students)! This place has such a warm, upscale, small-town feel. Because of that, we are close to a couple of the bartenders/waitresses and we always get into great conversations with other couples when we sit at the bar. 

Also, they brew their own ginger beer in-house and have the BEST Moscow mules. In fact me and my bestie come by here to get a few bottles of the ginger beer for girls night. The other cocktails they offer are incredible as well. The bartenders are very well-trained and sometime make their own creations which make the seasonal menu. 

This place is truly one-of-a-kind due to the food, atmosphere, and employees. You have to go!"}
{"text":"Quite a tasty place to eat. Burger nights on Mondays are particularly great (and cheap). I also highly recommend the plantain nachos! They are absolutely delightful!"}
{"text":"Dreadful experience tonight. It's Monday, their busiest night.  We expected a wait, because we had not made a reservation.  However, three hostesses were not necessary. When one asked another to bus a table for us, (or wait for the lone bus boy,) she did nothing.  When we were finally seated, a hostess, (one of the two who seemed capable,)  brought us water.  We waited 18 minutes, watching four waiters carefully ignore us.  We left, unfed, unserved and unsatisfied.  
Note to Management: Training, extra servers who actually serve would serve your establishment well."}
{"text":"Bistro On Main is a nice change from the college student oriented eateries around Kent. The service was great and the decor of the restaurant is nice, but I was a little disappointed by the food options on the menu. It would be nice if there were a vegan option besides the salads. I also wish the martinis on the cocktail menu would use more appropriate liquors considering the price of the cocktails. If I'm getting a $9 martini, I would prefer that the vodka in it not be smirnoff."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and the quality of the food has decreased so much recently. The service is exceptional. We went on Monday for $6 burgers...I'd rather pay half that price, get Swenson's, and eat in my car."}
{"text":"This is the place you go on a date or for a special occasion or just because the food is so good. Everything on the menu is what you'd see in an upscale chef driven place. Prices are between $15 to $30 for entree's, depending of course on what you order.
Atmosphere is dark and clean, quiet in the dining area and louder in the bar area. Get reservations if you plan to go on Friday or Saturday but most other days, seating is quick. My mouth is watering just thinking about some of the dishes I've eaten here - and the house salad is the best ever!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best restaurant in the Kent area. 

I have had plenty of their dishes over the past few years and have loved every single one. I highly recommend their Monday night burger special. The burgers are big and done to perfection! The french fries that are included are quite delicious as well.

Another one of my favorites is the crab cake dish. Very well done, and if you get the appetizer, it's $10. The atmosphere is classy and a little on the dim side. The wine list is spectacular, too. The adult mac and cheese is my friend's favorite, and he highly recommends it! 

Even the bread with oil is good! If you are hesitant, don't be! Bistro on Main is amazing! Anyone who says different, simply doesn't have good taste."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, although it is a bit pricey their food is delish"}
{"text":"Drinks are expensive and the menu is very small, very limited selection. Two drinks, an appetizer and entree will run about $50. For such a casual restaurant, I just don't see the appeal. For example, $11.50 for a burger. House martinis are made with Smirnoff  Vodka at $8.50, and those are the inexpensive items."}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly agree with the review who called the Bistro \"probably the best restaurant in the Kent area,\" but I'd say that it's undoubtedly the best. This place is so underrated, & it's in such a weird spot, on the kind of gross part of 59 near all the car dealerships... but the Bistro is truly an exceptional spot. 

The food here is SO GOOD, period, & that makes it worth coming back to over & over & over... & over. I've been coming here since they opened nearly a decade ago, & it's still among my favorites in the area. Their menu changes with some regularity, but as I write this, I'm a big fan of their plantain nachos (so unusual!), crispy Brussels sprouts (OH MY GOD), adult mac & cheese (there's lobster in it!), sweet potato gnocchi (one of the most delicious dishes I've ever tasted)., & the adult cherry coke (mmm, whiskey). The atmosphere is quaint & perfect for a meal with your parents or with a date. 

Occasionally, you can snag a good deal on Groupon, which helps bring down some of the high prices (again: the food is WORTH IT), & they have great nightly specials. On Wednesdays, they host \"The Original Cheap Date Night,\" your choice of six pizzas or three pastas, two salads, & a pitcher of draft beer or bottle wine, plus dessert for two...  all for $35. Can't beat that!

If you're staying at the hotel in Kent, the Bistro will send a shuttle to pick you up for dinner! I love that they've implemented this creative service to help make up for their less-than-ideal, off-the-main-drag location. And if you're not visiting from out of town? You have no excuse not to drive over to the Bistro on Main & eat your little heart out."}
{"text":"I went here for a Valentine's Day date a couple weeks ago. The service was excellent, and the ambience was perfect for a romantic date. As far as the food goes, I came here when they had a burger special for $6. I got lentil quinoa burger while my date got the BOM Burger. The lentil quinoa burger was pretty good, but nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary. The fries were also not too bad, but again nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary. Compared to the wide variety of food options available in Kent, Bistro is not anything too special, but it's a good place to go on a romantic date. The food isn't terrible, it's just that there isn't anything stand out about it."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Saturday around 1:30 and the restaurant wasn't very busy. The service was pleasant but slow and we thought we were never going to get our food. The menu is small, which usually means that the restaurant has great quality food instead of loading up on a bunch of items they keep in the freezer. I had the BOM burger and my lunch partner had the chicken salad with the potato salad. The burger was very good and seasoned well. However, everything else needed a lot more seasoning. The food is decent, but for the total package of slow service (including kitchen time), the price and the food, I'm guessing there are a lot better places in the area."}
{"text":"Really tasty and surprisingly creative fare in a cozy environment. I'm not a regular on the Kent dining scene, but I'm down there a few times a year or more, and this was the nicest meal I've had in Kent. Lots of very fresh seafood, clever riffs on some traditional favorites, and a really friendly setting. I think there's a reason the parking lot looks like a German car dealership -- there aren't many good upscale options in town. That German car aura cuts both ways; it's a bit pricey for Kent, but the quality is there to justify it. Lots of great wine and beer options top things off. Best of all, you can still tell you're in a college town because it's not stuffy."}
{"text":"I ate here for a rehearsal dinner, so it's probably a little different than the typical experience, but it was a wonderful dinner either way! Our party was in a back room that could be opened or closed to the restaurant and there were probably about 30 people there.  Here's everything I tried at the dinner, it was all soooo good! I would definitely go back!

Crispy Brussels Sprouts - GET THESE! Salty, sweet, crispy, crunchy deliciousness! You can really taste the honey and red wine vinegar combination and it's amazing!

Tacos - I couldn't find these on the actual menu, but they were like a braised beef taco.  The meat was really moist and worked well with the lettuce and chesse.

Baby Blue Salad - The balsamic vinaigrette on this salad was SO GOOD! I would order this again just to eat the dressing! The candied nuts and bleu cheese were also great!

Fire Charred Flat Iron Steak - Seasoned perfectly with creamy mashed potatoes and yummy asparagus!

Seared Atlantic Salmon - This came with crispy spinach, red pepper orzo, and a balsamic reduction.  I'm not a big red pepper fan, so I was a little worried about the orzo, but it didn't taste like red pepper to me at all.  It was the perfect compliment to the salmon!

Creme Brulee - The creme brulee was so cute and delicious!

Mille-Feuille - I honestly had no clue what this was and had to google it before I ordered it haha It was really good though! It was like a puff pastry with a vanilla and lemon sauce on it.  It was sweet and fresh which is what I wanted.

Moscow Mule - Holy Moly, these were tasty and strong! I had two and definitely felt it more than I was expecting! I would definitely order them again, but be careful!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this past wednesday with some regulars, and had a lovely evening. The bartenders were super friendly and accomodating, the decor was clean, nice yet simplistic. I like that better than clutter where dust can gather at restaurants, yuck. They had a Wednesday night couple special deal with a bottle of wine, an entre to split and two salads for $35. a Great deal, but we ended up getting doing our own thing, and had this amazing stuffed chicken dish. It was great and more than enough for us to split.  The drinks we made with more than ample alcohol, the tables had fresh flowers, and the prices were reasonable. I will say there were some pricey dishes on the menu which in my mind is a tough sell for kent, I didn't try any of them, but could be worth it. Anyways, it was a very nice overall experience and i plan on returning."}
{"text":"My wife, son and I ate here this past Saturday, and I just texted my wife that I can't stop thinking about how good our meals were. The sweet potato gnocchi was so great! The flavor and the textures were surprising and absolutely pitch perfect.  My son had the Adult Mac and cheese which he devoured.  My wife had the fish special, and the bite she shared with me transported me to a favorite beachside resort.  The dining room and bar area were spotless and hip.  So...yeah, we loved it!  I highly recommend this little jewel of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service! A little bit of a limited menu, but a beautiful place to have a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"Though crowded on a Tuesday due to their $5 burger special, the pork chop that I ordered was perfect!  The ambiance was very nice, yet the staff seemed genuinely interested in what the patrons were saying, often recommending options to people seated near me at the bar.  Fantastic menu selections that are certainly creative.  If you'r questioning this place - GO!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to dine in the area. Food has been consistently great and service is fantastic. Highly recommend reservations. Popular place for locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"Driving past this place many times, Bistro on Main radiates a fancy look, except for the almost all gravel type parking lot. Luckily, that's not what you're there for! 

Inside Bistro on Main is certainly the opposite of its lot - with a nice hostess to be greeted by the restaurant is nicely dim lit with equally nice decor. a rounded out table sat us with a nice view of the bar and SportsCenter. 

Monday is the day to be there. The 5 dollar burger and fries special is so famous on Monday's that I heard the waitress ask a group if they \"needed menus or just the burgers.\" I looked over the menu and listened to the rest of the day's specials just in case there was a game changer, but let's be real, I was gonna get the burger. 

The burger and fries were not a disappointment. Great sized portion, filling and satisfying with good service. 

Not a super fan yet until I try more menu items, but a definite must try.

{"text":"We celebrated our son's birthday by going to dinner here.  It was our first time there.  Both of our sons attend Kent State and we will definitely be back here to eat.  The drinks were excellent(I recommend the cucumber cooler), the scallop appetizer was delicious and so was the pizza.  My husband said it was the best burger he has had and my son's pork shank dinner literally melted in his mouth.  I had the ribeye special and it was perfect.  We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Last week was my parents joint birthday dinner and they've always wanted to try the bistro. I was hesitant since my first visit wasn't all that great but I must admit that I had a much better experience this time around. 
  All the guest enjoyed their food, however my sister didn't like the honey that was on the grilled cheese & would not have ordered it had it stated that honey was used on the menu (but that's just a personal preference, doesn't mean it was a bad sandwich). My brussels sprouts were huge!!! The portion was so large that it could easily be shared between two people. Although I had to send them back, the cook accidentally put green onions on them, our waitress was really nice about it and took care  of me right away. 
  They also burnt my fathers creme brulee badly but he ate it anyways; after all, it was free since I had checked in with Yelp ( a nice surprise)! However, parking was terrible, there's only way way in & out so it is a great idea to car pool or park @ Stoddards next door."}
{"text":"Fantastic! There is a fire place outside for a good date night feel. The service is great. Food pricing is really good.. But drinks are a bit pricey.. We do go quite often and have never had a bad experience. Not a kid friendly place for small children"}
{"text":"Only been here once tonight and was pretty amazing. Great atmosphere. Nice lighting. Bar is cool. Good fancy drinks. Very nice staff. 

We came on Valentine's Friday and had gnocchi and fancy Mac and cheese and a glass of wine and a spicy mango margarita. Everything tasted amazing. I really wanna come back for another date night and see if it holds up. I will update then!

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food!  We have had some of the best steaks here in the area. Good Bourbon selection. Check in with Yelp for a free dessert."}
{"text":"I grew up in Kent and Bistro on Main is exactly what the Kent community has needed forever.  Leave it to a Kent guy to move away and then come back to bring some class, excellent fare and creative cuisine to this college town.

The food is exceptional and creative, the staff is extremely knowledgeable, friendly and outgoing and the wine list is solid for the restaurant style and community.  The decor and ambiance is wonderful and the menu changes frequently with incredibly unique and flavorful dishes.  I can't recommend Bistro On Main more highly!"}
{"text":"This was probably the best meal we've had in a long time. Every pat of it was great. The beer selection was excellent. There are enough vegetarian options to actually have choice! The puff pastry asparagus and jalapeno cream sauce? Killer. The sweet potato gnocchi? More, more please. The blueberry mille feuille? I can't say no. It was all incredible. Definitely will be back again."}
