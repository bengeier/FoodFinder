{"text":"I have visited K-pocha a couple times this summer and every time we go, we go for their fried chicken.

This ma and pa restaurant is small and dimly lit. There are a few booths on the side for small groups. The service can be slow, but the server is always friendly and polite.

K-pocha has become the go-to place for my boyfriend and his friends when they're feeing fried chicken + beer because they offer an amazing deal: $25 for fried chicken + 5 beers (or a bottle of soju). You can choose various flavours for a few extra dollars (Korean spicy sauce, green onion, etc.) and you can also choose other dishes. There is a whole list of other dishes you can order with the drinks, but the only ones I can remember are karaage (Japanese fried chicken, which I believe is more gingery), chicken wings, and seafood pancake.

The fried chicken is always made to order, so expect a bit of a wait. While you wait, they give you a bit of coleslaw and some buttery corn on a hot plate that tastes amazing. My personal favourite is their green onion fried chicken. The green onions really complement each piece of crunchy, juicy, deep-fried goodness. The guys tend the enjoy their Korean spicy sauce more because it gives a bit of a kick.

K-pocha is a bit of a drive from my place, but we have friends who live in Pickering that would actually come to Mississauga late at night just for Korean fried chicken + beer. We don't know anywhere else that offers fried chicken + 5 beers/a bottle of soju for $25!"}
{"text":"Good deals in the meals and beers combo. Fried chickens are good, came out hot and crispy. Good place for hanging out with friends over alcohol and fried or greasy foods."}
{"text":"I love chicken, and this place is definitely a part of my top three chicken places to be in! The food came in a tad bit slow, but it was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"My g. I'm back at it, I will never stop. Ya boy Schoolbus Russ at it again.

So I'm chillin with my g fam at my cribbo. Cool right? Not cool when the boys need some wings. We speed to k pocha cause we want some wing goodness

We get there, and get to chompin. As your boy is eating some gangsta k-trap Korean rap is playing. Shoutout Keith Ape. We enjoyed their music choice and vibes all night as we ate a cool corn plate that was mixed with cheese. Whatever that was, was amazing and should be televised so the world can know.

My g. Them wings? To die for. Your boy devoured them and my youts hit pon road.

Thank you k pocha. U did my hunger justice. Pimp don't simp.

{"text":"First time trying Korean food and it was really good. I loved the free starters they give you, the corn is really good and the coleslaw is so creamy .

 We had their KFC which is really good Korean fried chicken.  We had the half fried and the half spicy which had a bit of a sweetness to it i think. We also had vegetarian spicy rice cake with cheese. They are these amazing little logs of soft rice cakes in a very spicy broth with cabbage and cheese melted on top, what could be better? Also tried Spicy Chicken BBQ with cheese which were cubes of chicken on a skillet in a very spicy broth smothered in cheese. That was very good. 

My only complaint and the reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4 is the waitstaff.  The service is not great at all. Had to ask to get refills for water many times. Had to ask for more napkins many times.  Also asked to have our food packed up and had to ask 3 times for that. We just felt like we kind of ignored there. Hopefully the service gets better"}
{"text":"So excited to try the food here but got enormously disappointed with their service. Came in a cold night with my Black boyfriend (I'm Asian) and asked for a booth and was told it's only for 4-5 people. Would have not said anything after that when I saw the first both was occupied by a White couple. Again asked the server why we can't have the booth. Said the same answer. I pointed to the first booth how come they get a booth? Guy has no answer. Don't want to pull the racist card here but I called a few weeks after to ask about their policy about the booth and the guy that answered the phone said it's first come first serve. Seriously disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered here with Uber Eats with my Insauga Promo Code. Ordered half spicy chicken half garlic soy as recommended by fellow Yelpers. Chicken came very warm. Not fresh out the fryer Hot. Skin could have been crispier. Sauce was not \"spicy\" but more on the sweet side. I understand the difficulty of delivering fried chicken so 3 stars. Next time I will dine in at K Pocha for soju, FRESH and HOT chicken, and that creamed corn everyone is raving about. Positive Note: the white crunchy radishes that came with the chicken were the perfect side!"}
{"text":"It's funny how I pass by this restaurant quite often but I never tried it until now. I have to say, I'm a fan of this place! Also, if you're a spicy eater like me then you'll love this place!! 

Let's start with the inside; the restaurant's interior is like those places you see in k-dramas where the protagonist goes to eat and drink soju with his/her buddies or significant other. I felt like I was experiencing what it would be like to go to a local bar/restaurant in Korea.

As mentioned earlier, a lot of their signature dishes are pretty spicy so I don't recommend this place if you can't handle the heat. So far, I've been here twice and the dishes I've tried so far are the: Spicy Rice Cake with Chicken or Pork Belly, a side pot of Army Soup (recommended for groups of 2-4), and a side order of Fried Chicken Wings. The spicy rice cake dishes have at least a spiciness level of 3 peppers. 

Overall, the food here is good especially the spicy stuff! This place is good for groups of 2-4 considering it's kind of a small. My only complaint is the food takes a while to cook but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First ever korean fried chicken experience and I totally loved it.  The buttered corn on a sizzling plate along with radish cubes are so refreshing to eat with the fried chicken. Although the prices are quite expensive but you get a very decent amount of chicken on the plate. We went there with 6 people and we all had a blast after a long day at work. Yes it was too dark in atmosphere but nothing anyone can do about that. Next time when we come back again as a furious group we're so going to try the soju!"}
{"text":"Location/Service
- Within a small plaza along Dundas St, plenty of parking available
- Relatively big restaurant, can accommodate big group of people (with reservations) - we were a group of 11!
- Staff pretty nice, service is just a little slow
- Decor is pretty plain, suitable dark atmosphere for that bar feeling to it

Food
- They changed their menu over the last little while, serving more chicken related dishes than just instead Korean Fried Chicken
- Still ordered different Korean Fried Chicken - spicy and cheese. The chicken were battered and fried to a good consistency, the spicy one has a lot of sauce while the cheese is a little bit dry. I'd prefer the spicy cause of the sauce, the cheese combo had a little weird tasting for me
- Ordered traditional family style dishes like Seafood Pancake, Spicy Rice Cakes. All of which are pretty normal, nothing too outstanding, but big portion to share
- Ordered a chicken pot dish. It's a little spicy, but the meat is a lot more tender, juicy and easy to chew on. I like this one the best out of all. Also has veggies and glass noodles as a side

For a Korean Fried Chicken place in Mississauga, this is not bad. Price is okay too - for 11 people, our final meal came to ~$21. If you ever have a craving or want a place to chit-chat with a few bar foods, this is the one to go!"}
{"text":"K-pocha is surprisingly pretty good.  The chicken is super moist here which I love.  The seasoning is decent.  The place itself is super dark and a little run down.  Staff was friendly on the good side.  We got the half and half - orginal chicken with green onion and spicy.  And the Spicy chicken with cheese on the hot plate. The hot place chicken is super spicy thou. Seems to be more spicy than home of hot taste."}
{"text":"The snow chicken, cheese corn and takoyaki is delicious here. You have to ask for the boneless chicken to be well done though because there has been two occasions where the chicken was too soft on the inside. Price is a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"K-Pocha is my first real experience of Korean Fried Chicken and it is solely responsible for the start of my chicken addiction. 

K-Pocha's concept is just great. It's got amazing fried chicken, beer, Korean side dishes, and amazing corn. I still remember how good that first bite of corn was. Imagine how I felt when I found out that they give out FREE REFILLS OF THAT AMAZING CORN. 

The prices of their chicken is very reasonable, it's in line with other Korean fried chicken places such as The Fry and Home of Hot taste. I prefer the garlic and soy sauce at K-pocha more than the Fry or Hot taste. I'm not a fan of strong spice myself, and I found K-pocha's spicy level to be at the perfect level. I recommend getting half soy and garlic and half spicy chicken. 

One thing I would stay away from is the boneless chicken. I tried this and it really wasn't good. It's a lot like sweet and sour chicken. Stay away. 

A huge tip: Ask for the white radish. The white radish really compliments the flavour of the chicken and unfortunately they won't give it to you at the start unless you're Korean... (something that deserves a different post altogether). Nevertheless, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"OMG!! I found my new Korean bar food spot!!  The food is so good!  Especially the sweet and spicy fried wings!! I wish there was more spiciness to it, but it will do!

We got the yako taki, fried wings in sweet & spicy and soy & garlic sauce, spicy rice cakes with pork belly and cheese, and hot poutine.  I enjoyed it all...I wish they had more cold dishes to cleanse your palette between each dish.  I would definitely come back here again.

It's a small place so not the greatest for a large group and they open at 5pm to 2am, all that good late night eats!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It look like your typical Korean bar type restaurant with booths and tables in the middle. Medium sized. 

The portion sizes were bigger than expected. 3 dishes for 3 people was a little too much. We could have easily ordered 2 and been fine. I really enjoyed the Dokbogi here. They have quite a lot of different types to choose from. We got the one with cheese and fish cake, which was delicious. Who doesn't love melted cheese with rice cake! It's an awesome combination.  But if that is too out of your comfort zone they have the regular one too. 

I don't usually like fried chicken, but theirs is delicious. We got the fried chicken half spicy and half garlic soy, it also comes with some French fries. I liked both flavours, but did actually prefer the garlic soy. The meat was flavourful and nice and juicy. They serve different parts of the chicken too so you get a bit of everything. The batter was good not too thick and crunchy. I also enjoyed the radish, which served as a great side dish to the chicken. Eating their fried chicken is definitely a must. And if you enjoy beer they go really well together. 

We also get the army stew. Which is soup with spam, sausage, ramen, and kimchi. This was good too, but not my favorite of the dishes."}
{"text":"The only KFC I eat is Korean Fried Chicken!!! 

I've been coming here for quite a while now and I think i can provide a pretty well rounded review. 

The restaurant is quite small so it can get pretty crowded on some days. There's also not many staff on hand. Most of the time there will only be one server for the entire restaurant so service can be slow.
Expect to wait at least 30 mins for your food! 

My favorite thing to get there is of course the fried chicken! They double fry it so its superrr crispy. It also comes with a portion of fries, the same kind they have at Costco, so they're equally as crispy! Personally I really like their soy and garlic flavour, but the spicy is also quite good! FYI though, it's not actually spicy at all, its more like a ketchupy BBQ sauce so don't be afraid to try it! The prices for the chicken may seem a bit steep, starting at $20 I believe, but you get 2 chickens worth of meat! Definitely bring a friend with you to eat.

The spicy rice cakes on the other hand are actually quite spicy unlike the spicy chicken. I really recommend the one with fish cakes! Good flavour but it is a bit more soupy than I would prefer. While I usually go for the chicken, they also offer stews! During my last visit I tried out the army stew, which was very different from any other Korean food I've had! It was quite large, definitely needs to be shared with at least 1 other person. The stew had these fried rice cakes, kind of similar to a rice crispie. Such an interesting texture and it also has a slight roasted flavour. Definitely will try this again on a cold day!

TIP: Only dine in!!! You miss out on the side dishes when you order out (except side dishes) and the chicken is never as crispy once it sits in the box. If you must do take out, know that the portion appears to be a little less and you'll need to pick it up right away! 

Bottom line: The fried chicken is AMAZING, the other dishes are hit or miss but all pretty solid. Service can be spotty but friendly! And it'd definitely great value."}
{"text":"Love love love the food! Space is a bit small though, but well worth the squeeze. Although their menu had a lot of spicy food, they're open to making things less spicy if you request it. The pork hog is yum."}
{"text":"I'm a regular to this restaurant, and all honesty the restaurant has gotten better and better as time went on.

It's pretty pricey food and it's portion but it's the only Korean Chicken place in Mississauga that does it well and opens late. Which is great as generally most restaurants here close early.

The food itself is great, of course you can't compare it to the Chicken served in Korea but the restaurant does seem to be making the recipe better over time which I respect. It is slightly better than mediocre but you can see the love put into it.

The service is great, it used to be pretty bad but it's gotten so much better over time. Servers are a lot more through, and polite. They take care of you pretty well.

CONCLUSION: We spent 80 dollars for 2 people, we were satisfied as we love Korean chicken but If you're not looking to spend too much then this place might not be for you."}
{"text":"Came here really late on a Saturday night with a couple of my friends. We ordered a few appetizers - corn cheese, hot poutine, takoyaki and the karaage. 

OMG! Everything was delicious. From the buttery corn to the spicy sauce on the poutine and the CHEESE on everything. 

Ugh, definitely going back. There will be an update on this review realllllllll soon!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for dinner with my wife and this is the 4th time having Korean fried chicken in as many weeks.  My first introduction to it was the reason I'm sort of on this mission to find \"KFC\" in the Toronto area.  I recently had Korean fried chicken at a place in NYC recommended by a fellow Yelper and since then I'm want to find a place locally that makes it like that or better.

I had it at the Fry in North York the week after and my wife has made it at home and it was good too, really good.  So this is the 4th time eating it and the 3rd place since I first tried it.

This restaurant is in the corner of a strip mall along Dundas not too far east of Hurontario in a mall that is predominantly Asian with many other Korean businesses.

The place has sort of a strange set up in that there are booths on the sides which seem a bit more private and a small open area right down the middle.  I really wasn't too concerned of where we were going to sit so we sat in the middle.

I had ordered a Kirin but they were out so I just had a Sapporo to start.  I sort of didn't want fries so we actually ordered a rice dish to go along with the chicken.  My wife asked if the chicken was very crispy and our server had suggested we instead of getting chicken with all sauce we go half fried and half garlic soy which made sense so we did that.  For the other dish I ordered the pork belly with kimchi on rice.

Our server brought out a small combo of sweet corn which seems to be pretty much a universal staple at many of these Korean places I've seen so far as well as a small bowl of cole slaw as complimentary starters.

The porkbelly and kimchi rice dish came out first which was good because I was hungry and I didn't care that it preceded the chicken.  The kimchi was nice and spicy just how I like it.  It may have been a bit hot for my wife that doesn't like hot spice too much but she enjoyed it so much she was enduring it and really enjoying it.

The fried chicken came out and it had a small side of fries and ketchup with it.  The chicken was steaming out, fresh out of the fryer so that we did have to wait a minute or two to let it cool off to not burn ourselves.

This chicken was good the skin was very crispy and the inside was very juicy.  The pieces were (as on the menu) wings, thighs and drums as I'm assuming they saved all the breast meat for the karaage, not sure.  Still the pieces were not dry at all, very moist but very crispy on the outside.  My wife said she thought was a little greasy, I didn't think so.  There was a paper on the bottom of the tray and while it had some oil it wasn't collecting at the bottom and the paper wasn't heavy and saturated.  Perhaps I will try karaage one day but I really like the bone in chicken instead.  I would prefer wings over other dark meat pieces but I liked the dark meat pieces too.  

I like the food here and while it didn't live up to my experience in NYC (Turntable) it was IMO better than The Fry in North York."}
{"text":"I came here today during 6:30 pm with a friend of mine and the place was very packed! As for the service, it was pretty bad today because there were so many large parties seated therefore it took forever for us to get our orders in. 

I normally come here for their soy & garlic sauce chicken but this time I decided to try their spicy rice cake. I chose the pork belly and added cheese (costs an additional $3).

SPICY RICE CAKE (PORK BELLY): I was very surprised as to how big the portion was! On the menu, it says the spice level is hot, however; you are allowed to adjust if needed. I changed my spice level to medium and it was the right amount of heat. As for the dish itself, they give a generous amount of rice cake and a good amount of pork belly. The pork belly itself is soft and taste great as it is smothered within the thick chili paste sauce/broth. Within the broth you will find your usual cabbage and carrots. I found myself continuously dipping my rice cakes within the broth which made it so delicious! One problem I encountered was there was so much left over sauce!! (It felt like such a waste even though I tried to utilize as much as I can). I would recommend adding noodles as it would definitely soak up the remaining left over of the sauce.

SOY & GARLIC SAUCE CHICKEN: The only flavor of chicken I have tried, and will probably ever try! They are cooked to perfection whenever I get them but the only problem I have encountered is sometimes the wings are overwhelmed with too much oil. Nonetheless, they are fantastic. 

If you're ever looking for a late night meal, here is a great place to come! Expect the place to be packed during dinner hours on some nights."}
{"text":"Great KFC (Korean Fired Chicken) place in Mississauga. $35 for a whole chicken + 5 beers is an awesome deal. The Chicken is so crispy and fresh. They always give a side of fresh cut radish, coleslaw and the best sweetest corn in the world.  

They let you do 1/2 fried and 1/2 spicy chicken. This place is a good alternative to Minerva or Song Cook."}
{"text":"Great tasting fried Korean chicken!!! Small little Korean style pub. Nothing fancy but i would recommend to anyone looking for some good fried chicken. Service was ok but I really am not picky or hard to please. I'm not one of those yelpers who thinks he's a Judge on top chef."}
{"text":"Ordered sweet and spicy chicken for takeout with friends. It was around $14 for a decent portion for an app for two people.  

It was average.  Tasted like general tao chicken a bit.  May visit again and try something else, but not sure.  Cashier was nice though.  

Nothing wrong with the place, but nothing special either. More 2.5/5."}
{"text":"Average at best which was disappointing since we drove almost an hour to get here. Do not get the sweet cheese powder chicken (I think they called it snow chicken or something like that). Probably the worst flavour for fried chicken. The sweet and spicy was more sweet than spicy, left my tastebuds wanting for more. Chicken was complemented with Costco style fries (my least favourite style personally). The place itself was pretty small, we were a group of three and sat at a booth. It was a little tight getting in but it did resemble the style you'd see in Asia which was pretty cool. Staff was friendly too and were accommodative (we asked for a combo of the snow chicken and another which isn't an option on the menu)

Probably won't visit again."}
{"text":"This place always satisfies my Korean-style fried chicken cravings. My bf and I always order the boneless, sweet-spicy sauce and soy-garlic sauce, flavours... Love the complementary buttered sweet corn on a hot griddle!"}
{"text":"First time came to this restaurant yesterday at recommendation of a friend. We ordered the 2.5 lb crispy chicken legs and wings combo that comes with beers and I also ordered the mussel soup as appetizer. The food portion was quite large, great for group sharing and everything tasted really good. I really wish they have another location in Toronto because I would totally go eat there probably every week."}
{"text":"Regular Korean restaurant. They have your regular tables and chairs and there are also those booths. The bench in the booths could be wider though in my opinion.

Corn Cheese: sweet corn on a hot griddle topped with stringy mozzarella cheese. Could use more cheese but still so yummy.

SnoWing Chicken: fried chicken garnished with sweet cheese powder. Very interesting. It was okay... chicken a bit dry. 

Army Soup: kimchi, sausage, spam, vegetables and ramen noodle topped with a slice of cheddar cheese in a spicy broth. Now this ladies and gentlemen is the bomb dot com! Oh so yummy. Hot when we got it! Spicy And comforting. Genius to add spam and sausage in ramen!"}
{"text":"Their main menu Fried Chicken tastes terrible, worst experience ever. Never had that terrible chicken in my life. Also the chicken feet is horrible. Actually my standard for food is very low. I wasted $70 on uneatable food. Wish there are no more people waste money there."}
{"text":"K-pocha is such a hidden gem in Mississauga. Their fried chicken is as good, if not better than any place in the city. I might just have had the best Korean fried chicken in the GTA.

I was pleasantly surprised at the interior here which was warm and cozy. There were even booths available. 

We ordered the seafood egg drop soup and one full order of their fried chicken (2.5 lbs). The meal came with in-house made pickled radishes, coleslaw, and buttered corn on a hot plate. These additions were amazing and complimented the meal well. 

The egg drop soup is a must order here. There were many varieties but I was pleasantly surprised to see just how loaded this soup was with seafood and veggies. It's an incredibly hearty and rich soup. 

Okay now. I love the fact that this restaurant has fried chicken wings. Just like they have it at all the popular fried chicken joints in Korea. There's not too many places that do that oddly enough. We ordered the chicken in two sauces the soy garlic, and the spicy. It's nice to have that option. The chicken was crunchy, it was moist and juicy and there was just the perfect amount of sauce; it was neither drenched nor too light. The spicy sauce has strong gochujang tones and the soy garlic was perfectly sweet and salty. Combine these the 'side dishes' makes for an incredibly satisfying meal. Just remember to come hungry!"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) I've had to date, and my personal favourite fried chicken of all time. 

I like to split the fried chicken platter, that includes half spicy and half garlic & soy, between two people. It comes with approximately 2lb of chicken. The amount of chicken you get is deceptive due to the minimal bones that come with your order (try it, compare how many bones you're left with at K-pocha compared to the number of bones you'd have ordering 2lb at a traditional wing place). 

The spicy wings are not spicy at all, but instead served in a tasty, mild sauce. The garlic & soy wings are dry and are glazed with flavour. Both flavours were crisp and delicious.

Aside from my staple order, I've also tried the green onion fried chicken (also delicious, but I prefer the half/half), the soba noodles (decent), and the spicy mayo tiger shrimps (amazing). 

K-pocha is a Korean bar/lounge. Though it is a small place, they have two seating areas, including a handful of booths. K-pop and Soju advertisements and posters line the walls.

Service-wise, it isn't anything special, but they are prompt and get the job done.

Definitely check this place out, I can confidently say it's one of Mississauga's hidden gems."}
{"text":"Korean fried chicken yum!!

We ordered the combo, which comes with one dish and either 4 beers, one bottle of soju, or one bottle of makgueli (Korean rice wine).  We got the green onion chicken (half spicy and half soy garlic) with the beers.  This was $37.
The chicken took quite awhile to come, but it was worth it.  It was delicious and crispy.  The chicken did have bones, and was random parts of the chicken (some wings, some drumsticks, some more like breast meat).  Not boneless, but no biggie.

We then continued to try the spicy fish cake and rice cakes (pretty spicy) - $12.  And two types of soju cocktails (peach and yogurt) which comes in a pitcher with small shot type glasses - $20 each.  I couldn't drink the alcohol, but my friends loved it.  Said tasted like juice and was easy to drink.

For appetisers they give you corn in butter, and a salad type dish.  Not your typical Korean side dishes, but both good."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! Was randomly looking either Korean food and or wing place... and ended up finding both in one place! Ordered the Soy And Garlic Chicken which that platter and we'll feed for 3 people, very flavorful with a very nice batter. Bulgogi was very nicely marinated full of flavor and tasted just right. And the appetizer was uberly tasty with the buttered corn with butter on a skillet plate. FeiJaiApproved! FatkidApproved! Will definitely come here again and again!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place if you like korean style fried chicken. This place caters it and you get a plateful if you order in or do a take out. They also have other dishes in the menu as well but keep in mind that their specialty is more of the fried chicken part of the menu because a lot of new people who go in there think they cater to every korean dish out there--which they have SOME on the menu but not all. If you know what I mean. And yes, they definitely serve alcohol.

We started off simple for our first visit and ordered the Sweet and spicy chicken and beef bulgogi rice. Worth every penny you guys. Seriously. And we had a lot leftover of the chicken and had it to go.

Our waiter was really nice and no issues with the service at all. Everything was awesome on our first visit!

We will be definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food here! I ordered the cheese corn, 1/2 soy and 1/2 spicy boneless chicken and spicy rice cakes with pork belly. Hits all around! The corn is presented on a sizzling plate and really there's nothing to dislike. Sweet buttered corn? Good! Melted cheese on top of that? Good! 
The rice cakes were delicious too! They had a nice chewy texture, the pork belly was done well too and the sauce was a solid medium spicy (my husband found it to be a medium spice-for his Canadian palette and I found it to be just right. Flavoursome and zesty not overly spicy). The star of the show was definitely the chicken. The spicy was the star for us. The chicken was perfectly crispy, hot and juicy, no dry chicken here! The sauce was EVERYTHING! Like a combo of hot sauce and honey garlic. But you could taste all the elements and yet they blended together well too. I'm not sure that the soy and garlic really added anything, I think next time I would go for the plain as it would be a good contrast to the spicy. 
Another reviewer said to get bone in chicken, but I think it's really just personal preference. I found the boneless to be flavourful and juicy and not at all dry. 
Service was not the greatest but at 8 on a Saturday night, for only 2 servers it was fine. 
Atmosphere was almost pub like, you go, you eat, you hang out with your dinner company, no rush. 
Will come back again and with friends!"}
{"text":"This Korean restaurant is a very unique one in Mississauga. It's probably the only authentic Korean fried chicken store here. 

I have been here multiple times, the food is always satisfying in terms of the portions and the flavours. The menu doesn't fully reflect the look of each dish. I have no idea what to order based on the menu, so I have to try something new every time. Interestingly, so far, I always have good picks. 

One entree I always order is the half spicy and half fried boneless chicken. The meat is very juicy and the smell is tempting and makes you feel hungry. The deep fried chicken is easily chewed, and the spicy chicken is flavourful due to its combination of sweetness and spiciness. Surprisingly, I would like to say the french fries are so good. If it's comparable, I prefer the fries here over the ones at McDonald's. 

They usually serve customers a small portion of corn cheese. For some reasons, there is some magic there to keep you eating the corn and you would like to order more of it. For the side dish, we ordered tako wasabi. They serve in a small bowl as shown in the photo. It comes with tako, slices of onions and seaweeds. The tako is very fresh. After we wrap the tako with the seaweed and the white onions, it delights my appetite for the entire meal. I strongly recommend to give it a try for your visit."}
{"text":"The West seems to somehow always get the best. This is unquestionably one of the better KFC's I have tasted in this city...well out of the city in this case.

This place is no showstopper. It's a bit grimy in fact and maybe even a little dirty but that's typically all good signs if you are looking for great comfort food. I have been on a fried chicken binge as of late; all in the name of good health of course. I have long heard of this mythical place from friends out west; k-pocha~ rolls off their tongues like butter and silk, catchy like Netflix n chill.

This stuff is good. Lightly battered, crispy, tender, juicy, flavourful is how I would describe it and this is how good fried chicken should be. All the different flavours are distinct in their own way but the chicken remains the same regardless. They don't over-sauce their chicken like a lot of places or over-stack them to the point where they become damp from their own condensation.

The next time I am craving KFC I am going to skip that Yonge exit and head straight out west."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service.  Can't get used to the Canadian taxes and prices.  Good quality food.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"The food is terrible. The service is non existent. We had a large group, instead of giving us the larger table, we were all crammed in a small booth as some of us were exploding out of it."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a couple of years now and especially if I'm out with friends late at night and we want to satisfy our hunger we go this place for some good ol' fried chicken wings and KFC (Korean fried chicken). 

The place is dark, with a little lighting and they have tiny booths. We usually order the Fried chicken wings, half soy and half spicy fried chicken, rice with egg on top for 5 bucks! (pretty big portion). I sometimes get their ramen and it's pretty good! Their wings are super crispy! One serving of chicken wings is good for 2 people but when your really hungry its good for 1. Their fries are not bad as well.The soy garlic is really good and the spicy is not that spicy. They both have really good flavours. But, going back to before getting our orders they serve you coleslaw and sweet corn which is the bestttttttt!!! i'm not even kidding!! The coleslaw is amazing too, crispy, crunchy and fresh. 

This place is losing a one star for me due to the fact that if you were sitting in one of the booths, its hard to ask your waiter that your ready to order. Theres no bell in the booths, and need to keep sticking your head out to get their attention for more water, napkins and the bill.

This place is known to have young adults hanging out late and great place for drinking and snacking."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean spot to eat at. The appetizers are good (love the sizzling sweet corn) and fried soy and garlic/spicy chicken is the best. I enjoyed the deep fried octopus balls and the spicy rice cakes with either fish cake or pork belly. Servers are very polite and fast."}
{"text":"This place always hits my craving spot for korean fried chicken in mississauga. It's a small little korean pub that's basically open for evenings till late night. Not only is their fried chicken bomb dot com, but they have amazing apps you can try while waiting for your food.

My favourite on the menu is the green onion chicken and spicy poutine. Drink ways, soju is always the way to go!

I will always come to this place when cravings hit hard."}
{"text":"Amazing place ! Chicken was on point ! The service was great everyone there was super friendly!! Will definitely come back here !"}
{"text":"Good late night spot for Korean food. This place cooks up some decent Korean fried chicken. I usually order the spicy wings while my gf orders regular fried wings. The spicy wings do pack quite a punch but are tasty and juicy. The wings are fried perfectly and are not too oily. The servings are quite generous and filling. We also ordered side bowls of rice with a buttery fried egg on top, perfectly complementing the chicken. 

While you wait for your order to arrive, traditional Korean banchan (side dishes) are served but K-Pocha has their own take by serving coleslaw and a sizzling plate of buttery corn that is delicious. I've heard that you can ask for more which I have yet to try. 

The Korean rice wine (makgeolli) is bottled but also a great accompaniment to any meal, not too sweet and easily drinkable."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Their signature Korean style fried chicken is to die for and is a must have if you visit. However, the other dishes are simply divine and flavorful!    Their food has such a homemade taste to it that it keeps sending me back there over and over again. 

Seriously no complaints. It's a small little piece of heaven."}
{"text":"Their poutine is pretty good, but it was on the sweet side, so if you don't like your fries to be sweet, maybe not to get it. The deep fried chicken were alright. Also, I think price was a bit high, but it is unique in mississauga. There are many similar places in north york but not in mississauga."}
{"text":"For someone who would drive all the way to Thornhill for Home of Hot Taste, I've finally found... that hot taste at home. At K-Pocha. ~~~

The dark Korean pub-style restaurant has been throwing in little bits of random decor, keeping it homey. Service was a little slow last night with one server. We got our rice after our first dish... my table and I are the kind of people who NEED rice to eat anything. Kind of a bummer, but the food was still delish. 

Loved the banchan (Korean side dishes) of sizzling corn, radish, and \"slaw\". Good contrast to the chicken. 

But that fried chicken... so good! Love the kampoongi (citrusy fried chicken) and the extra taste of sesame that you don't get enough of at other restos. The fried chicken had a great flake, similar to tempura without the sogginess. The regular flavour had a bit of seasoning, but I think they marinate their chicken in some juices prior to frying. The spicy flavour was BOMB. Again, the sesame flavour and some fruitiness (maybe... I could be wrong) came through well in the sauce. There was just enough sauce left on the plate to dip the other chicken into. Yum :)

Tried sparking rice wine for the first time there and did enjoy. Good sweetness to contrast the chicken. All in all, thoroughly enjoyed and shall be back to devour the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Tip:  Personally, I wouldn't order the \"boneless\" as there were some grisly pieces.  Instead, order actual wings/drumsticks!

More like 3.5*, but I wasn't completely impressed, so I rounded down.  This was probably due to the fact that I ordered the \"boneless\" chicken when I wished that I would've ordered just the standard wings.

Serving of wings are perfect for 2 smaller chicks - keep in mind that it also comes with slaw and buttered corn!  ;)  Guys, I have no clue how 1 person finishes an entire order.  It's A LOT.  Serving of chicken/wings were around $24.

I wanted a beer, but there were NO combos offered for the wings + beer/soju.  :(  Wouldn't it make sense that if you ran a KFC place that you'd offer this?  Combos were only offered with the other mains...that I didn't want to try as a first-timer.  

Spicy had a nice kick to it, but was also on the sweet side.  Think:  Gochujang.  The Soy Garlic was neither very Soy nor Garlic.  This 'dry' chicken was nice, but desperately needed some kinda dip/more flavour.  We were dipping it in the ketchup provided for fries.

Fries were a la Costco.  So nicely battered and slightly greasy.  This place ain't for dieters/\"clean eaters\".  Booths were nice to sit at.

Lively atmosphere, even for a Wednesday evening.  Felt somewhat like Yonge/Finch area as opposed to a seedier part of Mississauga.  Waiter boy was friendly.

Would go back, but would order something else!"}
{"text":"Friends and I went here to try n satisfy our Korean Fried Chicken cravings, and were definitely not disappointed. Came here around 1045PM on a Saturday night and it didnt seem too busy or too quiet, just a good amount of people sitting inside. The restaurant itself is located in a plaza beside a grocery store so I'd assume when the market's open it's a bit tougher to get parking however. 

Food was priced fairly I thought for the amount of food we got. We ended up ordering a 2.5lb platter of the fried chicken wings in both their regular and sweet/spicy which came with fries, as well as a bowl of cheese ricecake (which was bigger than we thought), Also had to get soju and a beer, and altogether it wasn't more than $20/person. 

Service was a bit on the unattentive side though, as our server would usually forget one of the two things we'd ask whenever he swung by. Looked like he had a long day so might've just been an off day for him.

Will definitely be back if we're in the area!"}
{"text":"It's Saturday night, and there is only one server, so you can only imagine how long it took her to come and take our order....good 15 minutes. Throughout our time there, the server is fairly spaced out; however, when she does come to serve us, she's friendly and very good with explaining and accurately taking orders.
Their Food
If you love spicy food, you will surely love this place. Their signature dish, Korean Fried Chicken, is just as they boast: fried but not dry. Their chicken is not too oily, and is very moist.
Rice Cake is perfectly textured, so something people should try.
The Egg Roll is pretty much an omelette, and it's delicious. It came out EXACTLY as it is pictured in the menu!
The TakoYaki is neither amazing nor bad. The shell is a little too crunchy, and the inside is not juicy enough, but the taste is very much on point.
The Butter Chicken Gibble is decent...could be good if it wasn't drowned in black pepper....
The Oden Tang would be perfect if the broth is not so salty.
Last AND least, the Seafood Pancake was just disappointing. While it was good that it was not greasy like most places, there was no seasoning and the whole pancake was just blend.
Nonetheless, it was, overall, a good enough experience that we will go back again."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday. The service is not that bad but the food is okay. Ordered the bulgogi on rice, seafood pancake and wings. They were okay. The seafood pancake was nibbled on a bit and left there because it wasn't that great. The wings are okay too. Probably not going to come back."}
{"text":"Found korean fried chicken in Mississauga. Ofc i had to try it! 

Its a snugg place. When we went in there was a group of people in front of us. But there were so many seats. Took them forever to sit down and i didnt bother to find out what was going on. So I asked another server for a table for three. She checked the booth and told me we can get that table but she will clean it first. Waited another 10mins standing at the door and still no one cleaned the table. My frd got impatient and decided to just go sit in it first. After another 15mins, he waved someone down to finally get the table cleaned. 

The food was really good! Hence the 4 stars. I liked every dish we ordered! Got the corn cheese, spicy chicken with cheese, and half soy garlic half spicy fried chicken. I will def be coming back. Mayb not on a friday when its so busy."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming here since my cousins are always raving about it, and it did not disappoint. 

There was a group of six of us, and we shared a combination of dishes, most of which I unfortunately don't remember the name. What i do remember, however, is the seafood egg drop soup and soy and garlic wings. The wings is a fairly large order, so it was enough for six with the other food, but I guess if you're really hungry, you can probably finish one order on your own. There was also really good sweet corn and a basic salad with thousand island dressing to get some of 'em greens in. There was also a small octopus dish with onions. Oh, I almost forgot - the bulgogi! That was sooo good and there was a small battle of chopsticks to finish the last few bits.

The restaurant was easy enough to find (it's near a bunch of car places), and parking was not a problem on the night I went. There's other stores and restaurants in the neighbourhood that share the lot, but there were a lot of spaces. Just make sure the place you park isn't reserved for the grocery store or anything. 

Overall a good place and I'd be interested in going here again."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! Small little restaurant but do have lots of space for seating.  I should've tried their fried chicken as I hear it's the best fried chicken ever! BUT I just wasn't feeling it and ordered the pork belly on rice instead and omggg it was so yummy!  Also ordered, the poutine with the spicy sauce on top and that was the bomb.com!  It was so addicting to eat!  My boyfriend got Chijeu-buldak (Spicy chicken with cheese) it was super cheesy and we absolutely loved it.  Lastly, we obviously got the buttery chicken with cheese on top.  I mean do I have to say anything about it? It obviously sounds like orgasm on a plate :)
Overall, the food was delish and service was great.  Do recommend you come here if you're in the area and in need of some delicious Korean food."}
{"text":"K-pocha is always the prefect place for you to relax, especially with some crispy chicken wings/ grilled sweet corn( complementary) and grab some beer. It was tiny but well arranged."}
{"text":"K-Pocha is a late night Korean restaurant & pub in Mississauga that specializes in Korean style chicken. I have been a fan of Korean fried chicken since I first had it at The Fry. The menu was of course heavily concentrated on fried chicken, but they do offer some standard Korean dishes like bulgogi, rice cakes, pork belly, etc ... In regards to the prices, I would say that their food was fairly priced, as it was definitely cheaper than both The Fry, and Home of Hot 

In order to ensure the crispiness of the skin, Korean fried chicken are deep fried twice. This way of deep frying also creates a lot less grease all over the chicken. Looking through the menu, we decided to order the half spicy, half fried option ($21), and an order of crispy french fries ($5). The chicken took a bit of time to come out, but that was understandable as they are made fresh to order. In terms of presentation, both chicken were plated together with a few pieces of crispy fries. Nothing too special, but it was piping hot (just the way I like it). The fried chicken at K-Pocha had a nice crispy skin, and the meat itself was juicy. It wasn't heavy, or greasy at all, which was a great alternative to the greasiness of western chicken. I preferred the fried chicken over their spicy chicken, which I didn't think was spicy enough. I liked the taste of the sweet glaze, but I wished that it had provided a little more kick. 

The overall atmosphere was good for large groups, and they also had a few private booths on the side for a more intimate dining experience. The one thing that surprised me most was that they don't refill the kimchi at all. I have never been to a Korean establishment where they don't refill the bachan, or this case ... just a tiny bowl of kimchi. I just thought that was super stingy of K-Pocha, cause it was something that was unheard of. However, this doesn't deter me from returning to K-Pocha, as I did liked their fried chicken, and they are one of the few options in Mississauga that offers it."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Korean pub and I was pretty impressed with the fried chicken here!  Waaay better than KFC and Popeye's that's for sure. The spicy chicken was too spicy when taken with soju I think but oh well! The portions are pretty big and one order can easily fill two people. You get a few complimentary side dishes at the beginning as well"}
{"text":"Went back again to try the original flavor of the fried chicken and I thought the batter was good because the chicken was freshly fried to order! If you do opt to go with two fried chicken flavors, I think it's good to opt a saucey flavor and the regular fried chicken without sauce so if you think theres too much sauce from the saucey flavoured chicken wings, then you can use the regular fried chicken to transfer some of the sauce over. 

I personally liked the soy and garlic chicken flavor more because it had more flavor due to the garlic in the sauce. 

We also ordered fish cake soup. Unlike other Korean restaurants, the Korean fish cakes are not the sliced fish cake but rather cubes of fish cake. There were a lot of fish cakes in the soup though! 

We ordered the tabletop dakgalbi which is spicy chicken with melted mozzarella served on the rim of the pan. It's not found in a lot of Korean restaurants so this might be a good option you want to look into if you want to try something different!"}
{"text":"Tried the rice cake for the first time there! It was soft and chewy mmm wasn't that spicy imo. I think the menu changed since the last time I came here. There used to be a combo deal with fried chicken and drinks. That's no longer there anymore. 

Enjoyed my time here and the food. Service was a bit slow but we didn't mind it. We were able to split our bills easily so that was a bonus."}
{"text":"Been here on 2 separate occasions and each time, I enjoyed the food and left full.

- The fried chicken is good and is quite decent for a place in Mississauga. I've tried both the regular and the boneless fried chicken and enjoyed both. I personally don't think the garlic fried chicken is as good as some other Korean fried chicken places I've tried but I quite enjoyed the spicy fried chicken
- The fries taste like Costco fries (yay!)
- Each serving of fried chicken is enough to feed 2-3 people
- Each serving of fried chicken comes with ketchup and a little bit of fries and radishes on the side - I assume this varies daily (tip: maybe don't order sides until you get the fried chicken - we ordered sides from the start and had a lot of leftover sides)
- Service could have been a bit better. On both occasions I ate here, there was only 1 server who seemed very occupied. I had to ask for a refill of our water jug multiple times once but this is understandable because it was quite busy. 
- They deliver (yay!)
- They didn't split bills 
- Overall great food and atmosphere! Will be coming back again"}
