{"text":"Finally, a cheap diner of relative quality (sorry, Aris) in Roncesvalles! I would have given this a more reasonable four stars, but the only other reviewer so far gave it one star and had an experience that is so far from what I had that I can hardly believe it. I don't want this place to close, as it is the most affordable place to eat a decent meal on the street.

The other guy has only gotten take-out, and I've only ever eaten in. If you like typical Greek diners, and therefore have the right expectations, then you'll find this food is well above par for this kind of place. I've tried the chicken gyro dinner and the chicken gyro pita. Everything they serve is a cut above your typical local diner (sorry, Aris!). Instead of hard, dry meat you get juicy breast meat. Instead of wet iceberg lettuce with a tomato slice and cheap feta, you get a spinach and mixed greens salad with fresh olives, good feta, tomatoes and a nice, light olive oil dressing. Instead of a chunky dinner role or cheap white bread you get warm, soft, and toasty pita. The tzatziki is really excellent - not the runny and bland stuff - and the side of rice with my dinner was light and cooked just right.

And all this for about $5 or $6.

The burgers look good from what I've seen. I think that'll be my next order.

I admit that there are some kinks to work out in the service. The waitress there seems to get confused quite easily with orders and will mix things up, and the kitchen staff seems to be unfamiliar with the specifics of the menu, which might explain why dude had his take-out orders botched. But give it a chance, because there's lots of potential, and even with the kinks, it's still head and shoulders above Aris (sorry!)."}
{"text":"Generous helpings and staff that are a little clueless - but eager to learn and please!

Very friendly  

This place is new to Ronces.  I had a very cheap breakfast that was straight forward and filling,  and enjoyed a full souvlaki dinner a couple of weeks earlier.  Food has been good and well priced.    I think the review below is a little harsh... (some people are so angry...)

Its a new business that needs to perfect signature Greek dishes in order to live up to its name!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and was looking for a quick meal on a Saturday afternoon. I was actually on my way to check out Aris when I came across the Greek Spot. Very friendly waitress and cook. I ordered the dinner (chicken breast pieces, salad, potato, and rice. At a price of $11, the cook assured me I wouldn't get a deal like this anywhere else. I was pleased to see the cook slap on some uncooked chicken and prepare the salad from scratch. Took about 10 - 15 to prepare, I took it to go. He told me he put on some more chicken for me, probably because I'm still a growing boy. He packed the salad separately as to keep it cool and fresh. Finally, a cook who considers I need to walk this home and eat it! Food was also better than expected, the chicken being moist and cooked perfectly. The salad was also bountiful, with plenty of green olives and about half of a tomato. And romaine lettuce!! Zero complaints. The tzsiki (sp??) was on the side as well, allowing me to control my sauce distribution. 

The only question remains...will I ever make it to Aris?"}
