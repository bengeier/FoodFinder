{"text":"Restaurant atmosphere and setting was romantic. Had the a la carte and summerlicious menu and we were not impressed. The cod fish fritters for $21 was simply outrageously bad! Batter was falling apart and didn't taste or feel the 'cod' in the portion. The bastado lamb pasta with fennel was also uneventful - pasta was cooked well but I didn't really understand the composition of this dish. Overall I didn't  feel the Tuscany at Tutti Matti."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place, having lived in the heart of Tuscany for many, many years.  Indeed the menu draws its inspiration from one of Italy's most respected regional traditions, where fresh, earthy and simple ingredients are the star.  The emphasis is on pork (cured in various ways), wild boar, mushrooms, local vegetables, and superb olive oil and spices.    Tutti matti tries to follow in that tradition but IMHO fails to deliver on taste.  My funghi starter lacked flavor and texture and looked lost in too large a plate.  The maiale main (herbed and spiced pork done in a \"porchetta\" style) was ok, but again did not express its flavours with the needed intensity: it was fatty and pleasant enough but hardly memorable. My partner's porchetta starter was described as tasty but not raved about, while venison as a main lacked flavor and was nondescript.  Wine list is pretty generous, and our Supertuscan was the best part of the meal and still affordable despite restaurant markups.  Service was very friendly and so was the atmosphere.  The issue here isn't the theme, decor, or service:  the chef(s) need to be less lazy and work way harder if they want to honour and replicate a real Tuscan experience rather than loosely imitating it in name but not substance.   Toronto has room for Tuscany, but only if it wants to excel."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and tried the summerlicious menu.  It was completely overpriced for what you got.  The fish was too salty and had too much lemon.  The dessert was too sweet.    The worst part was the service.  I don't go out to be served by some surly waiter who looks like he rather be anywhere else but serving us.  When I ask questions I am not looking for unhelpful one-word answers and an attitude.  The best part was the bill.  He automatically added a tip to the bill (there were 3 of us...not a typical thing to do) and didn't bother to mention it.  Of course we paid another tip on top of it and only noticed this morning.  What a rip off!    The food on other occasions I've eaten here (I work across the street) was reasonable, but after dealing with this unpleasant waiter once again  I will never return."}
{"text":"The tables at the back are pretty quiet, and it's very cozy.  I was with one other person. I ordered Steam Whistle beer for $7.    We ordered Pappardelle ($22), hand cut pasta with brisket, cherry tomatoes, garlic and basil. This tasted great; the pasta was pretty thick, and it tasted home-made. The pasta sheet was rolled up and cut in wide widths. The sauce was very tasty, not too salty or greasy. The large halves of cooked garlic just melted in your mouth.   We also got Pollo al mattone, ($36) for two people. As the menu says, this is chicken with crispy fried artichokes, served with boiled and halved baby potatoes and uncooked green beans tossed generously in pesto. Chicken was very moist, flavourful (a little on the salty side though) and tender. Yum.  We didn't get dessert, or coffee or tea, because we were just so full.   They served us 5 small pieces of bread with balsamic and olive oil to start. When we ran out, the waiter asked us if we wanted more, which is very good of him. However, the \"olive\" oil didn't have the fragrance of high-quality olive oil, or even any olive oil at all....kinda sketched out about that...I know different olive oils can have different fragrances, but it should have A fragrance...this had none...just tasted like oil, didn't leave any scent in my mouth. At an Italian restaurant that charges such prices, I'd expect great quality olive oil...I wonder what quality oil they use to cook the food. That's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Basically, it tasted fine, but I didn't get any of that distinctive olive oil fragrance.  The food tasted very good (except for the questionable olive oil, which isn't that big of a deal). Service was excellent; very friendly and attentive waiter who really cared about our dining experience."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened, was it because it was lunch.  In any case, quite disappointed.  I've heard great things about this place but...the pasta was over cooked, the meat sauce was grainy and had the taste of meat sauces that have been left to simmer for too long.  Most disappointing was the porchetta lunch, the pork was good but sat a top dry dense bread, one of which was and end piece...for $18, I'd think I could at least get some better pieces.  Service was nice and attentive.  Should have kept the short ribs that were accidentally brought out to me...perhaps dinner will be better...one last thing, I asked for a child's portion of pasta, the children's price is not half the price of regular...$12 instead of $14, should have just gotten the regular size."}
{"text":"I thought the food portion here for the price was a joke. I still felt hungry when I was done and left. It was no wonder why this place was empty when my friends and I were there at what is considered peak business hours at a normal restaurant. As for the taste, food here is good but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Walked by on my way to Chinatown and took a look at the menu.  I thought there was a fixed price menu available for $20, so I decided to try it based on a conversation with a coworker the day before. The fixed price was not available Grrr. Would have been nice to indicate that it was a lunch offering only.   Appetizers  Soft shell crab - 2 battered and fried crabs were good. Not really worth the $24. 3.5/5 crema di zucca - mushrooms with a squash puree.  My wife said it was good and would get it again $18  Main  pappardelle with beef brisket - pasta was cooked well, but I was not too hot on the brisket.  Very meh dish. 2/5 $24  tagliatelle - My wife said it was ok.  Again pasta cooked well. 3/5 $24  Service wise, it was just ok.  My water glass was never empty (love that!), but we were never asked if we wanted cheese or pepper.  The table beside us had MUCH better service. 3/5. We usually tip 20-25%+ but could not justify that for the service we got.  Left a minimal 15%.  We eat out a lot and are always looking for new places.  Tutti Matti was a disappointment especially how my coworker was saying it was a go to place for her and her husband. For $115 (with tip) I've had much better food and service. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My friend found this restaurant from some review sites and we were interested in Tuscan food, so we decided to there at dinner time.   Firstly, a guy who served us was so nice and pretty good explain about food and wine.  We got some Antipasti at first, and then did order pasta bastarda.  I loved this pasta so much.  Most of pastas which I had ate before in Toronto ware little soft texture for me but it was perfect al dente. As for pasta, might be best in Toronto at this time. Also the wild boar stew is very tender meat with rich taste.  Little salty stew but this pasta was very thick, so actually good valance.  I definitely would like to go here and eat pasta bastarda again."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I have been to Florence and the outlying regions a couple of times...Tutti Matti \"GETS IT\" Bravo...Bravo. I can't say this for many Italian restaurants in the city. My background is Italian and I am familiar with the different cuisine each region has to offer in Italy as I have been there a number of times. Tutti Matti by far has been the best Italian dining experience I have had to date. The dining room is cozy and intimate, great for first dates and or larger parties, it has an open kitchen which is great...they cook the food with such intensity, enthusiasm and passion. The staff is very knowledgeable and easy-going and they also have a Sommelier. Great..great selection of wines...Another great thing about Tutti Matti is that they do not make substitutions to their dishes, which is GREAT, they serve the dishes the way they were meant to be served...Amongst the dishes served and a must try is the antipasti, carpaccio affumicato -smoked duck, orange, pecorino Toscana and extra virgin olive oil smoked venison, figs, crushed pine nuts, arugula and nine year old balsamic vinegar, Pasta dishes which is also a must try tagliatelle con cinghiale - hand cut pasta, wild boar stew, porcini mushrooms (Wild boar which Tuscany is known for).. Kudos Chef...KUDOS!! I can go on and on about the rest of the dishes I have tried...however you would have to see and taste it for yourself and experience this culinary dynamo!!!  I really don't have anything negative to say about Tutti Matti as I had the best experience from start to finish. I have told friends about this place, they have had nothing but good things to say, Toronto has not had it so good, whenever I want a taste of Tuscany and can't get to Italy all I have to do is visit Tutti Matti!! See you soon."}
{"text":"I'm always a little apprehensive to visit restaurants during Winterlicious but the experience at Tutti Matti was fantastic. Service was amazing, not only by our waitress but also by the owner. Food was delicious and the perfect serving size."}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 for a birthday, and the service was ok. Although the waiter was nice, it took a very long time for the food to come. The entire dinner almost took 4 hrs!! Everyone in the party was getting tired of waiting! Food was very expensive for what it is. Maybe the waiting made it less enjoyable. Food tasted ok, nothing to rave about and portions are small.  Considering the bill was close to $900 we left feeling hungry. I also didn't appreciate the $4 pp charge for cutting a birthday cake that I brought in. I thought that was what tip is for. I would never go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I love paying $18 for a green salad. Not.  I would not go to this place again, it was overpriced and the portions were a little small.  Also, if you cannot season food properly, get out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"We went to Tutti Matti Ristorante Toscano for their Sagra dei Matti (Festival of the Crazies Prix Fix Tamworth Pig Dinner on November 30, 2012. A little over a year ago we met Chef /Proprietor Alida Solomon's father at the now closed \"Goody's Diner home of the imaginative 8 ounce hamburger\". I was photographing the food and he recommended his daughter's restaurant very highly. As one would expect a father to do. So when we read a tweet from @tutti_matti about the #festivalofthecrazies pig dinner on November 29, 2012, I made a reservation for my wife and I. We were promptly seated upon our arrival at the restaurant. Our server asked about water and we asked for \"Toronto\" water. He went away. We looked at the wine list. The waiting started. Fifteen minutes later, with no water and no wine, our server finally brought the water and immediately disappeared to serve other tables. No opportunity to order any wine. Finally he returned and we ordered a bottle of Fielding Estate Winery Rock Pile Pinot Gris 2011 Jack Rabbit Flats Vineyard. He brought the bottle unscrewed the cap and my wife accepted it. We then asked him to serve small pours so that the wine would last throughout the meal. After all, it was a five course meal with seven dishes. That was a big mistake. The wine got poured initially and once after that. The rest of the time we served ourselves. The host walked back and forth by the table and throughout our meal looked at the table, maybe once. He did fill the water glasses once. He never looked at the wine glasses or poured the wine refills. The Antipasto arrived. Our server explained how to mix the housemade Savory Salt in the oil. He said the hot breads rosemary pound cake, focaccia, and brioche to accompany the antipasto Pinzimonio was on its way. In fact, the hot breads did not arrive at the table until after the next course had been served and eaten. Oh, by the way, Our white wine was standing on the table, not a wine bucket in sight to keep it chilled. I did not see any wine buckets being used anywhere in the restaurant. The handmade Tagliatelle pasta with pork & chickpea ragu arrived. I served it to the wife and myself. There was a great deal of pasta and quite a few chickpeas but after the first small bite of pork ragu there was no more to be found. Lots of pasta, no pork. We waited again for the main course. The menu said \" Roast Tamworth Pig with apricots, chestnuts & rosemary\" with \"Polenta French Fries\" and \"Fagioli {white beans & sage}\" A plate with two sausages and a lot of sauce was placed in the middle of the table. Beside it was a deep dish filled with white beans. I looked at my wife. Where was the \"Tamworth Pig\"? Was this our order? Was this part of the Prix Fixe Menu? Where was the Tamworth Pig? Where were the Polenta Fries? Where was our Server? All were missing in action. Or, so we thought. When our server finally appeared we asked if this was the main course. He went away and finally came back saying that it was. We asked about the Polenta French Fries. He went away again and they were brought to the table many minutes later. It turns out that the Roast Tamworth Pig slices were hiding under the thick sauce and the sausages. We were not happy. Not at all. To add to a memorable evening my Panna Cotta was served in a ramekin which had two large chips in the rim. It was a very expensive disaster of a meal."}
{"text":"3/5! Good food but there are better Italian restaurants in Toronto- especially for the price point. As mains, I would recommend the pappardelle or costole Di manzo. For dessert- hands down go with the tiramisu."}
{"text":"A great Tuscan-Italian place. Yes, it can be quiet at the beginning of the evening, but it soon fills up. Yes, it can be a little expensive, but I have no complaints about the quantity or quality of the food. All pasta is hand-made. As far as service was concerned the young waiter was attentive but unobtrusive, therefore no complaints here either. It is a little off the beaten track (just east of Spadina) but thats what makes it a cool and relaxing place to go to dine."}
{"text":"great pasta and steak but unfortunately the service was not up to par. we have a baby at home and have really cut down on dining out. while my stomach was happy, I would have preferred to spend one of our rare nights out somewhere where I felt better taken care of!"}
{"text":"Tutti Matti is a hidden gem. This is a small traditional Tuscan style restaurant. The food is fresh, seasonal and beautifully presented.  This is a busy spot at lunch and not the kind of place to go if you don't have time to relax and enjoy your meal. At night it's rather quiet when they start serving dinner but generally picks up nicely swelling with a wonderful atmosphere by the end of the evening.  While I love the fact that they do summerlicious and winterlicious I'm not surprised that many of their negative reviews seem to stem from these customers. Do not eat here if you're expecting East Side Marios or some other terrible \"Italian\" restaurant. Your pasta will be al dente. Your food will be seasoned with things other than just salt, pepper and ancient dry flavourless chili flakes. You will have to pay a reasonable price for your meal and might even be forced to enjoy yourself. It's terrible I know but quality should cost more than a Big Mac and take more time to prepare.  Their dining room is large enough to accommodate large parties but call well enough in advance so they can set up. Jockeying seats around can be a bit of an issue once tables start to fill up.  I have never had anything but wonderful experiences with the staff. They are incredibly polite, knowledgeable and sweet.  Long story made longer; -Great food. -Great staff. -Reasonably priced. -Simply amazing."}
{"text":"Ate the burrata.......very nice. Main course was the short ribs......phenomenal. Melt in your mouth.  Had a bottle of the Pazzo Sangiovese blend wine from Cali.......very good.  I am a fan!"}
{"text":"A solid 3 star rating.  It's a decent place to eat if you're not in a rush and looking for a mature and professional atmosphere. The food was good but I have to say, we left feeling a bit hungry. The food wasn't memorable.   Best time to go: weekday lunch or Friday night dinner Attire: casually classy Experience: quiet and low key night... You won't be picking up singles here Cost: I found it a bit pricy for the food but it was good Service: fair, no complaints Recommendations: any one of the pasta dishes"}
{"text":"Now.  When you dine in a large group, you can pretty much expect the wait staff to be grumpy.  I don't plan large dinner groups, but if I'm part of one, I make a point of being *extra* polite to the wait staff, knowing they're stressed.  Despite that, I didn't appreciate the waitress sighing and telling me the *proper* way to order a drink.  The food is delicious - I had a simple pasta dish with cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and mozzarella and my friend had a hand-made pasta dish with thick noodles and ground sausage.  Food's excellent.  Pricey, and small portions.  One waiter was very good - grace under fire - and I tossed in an extra tip for him when he spent a lot of time figuring out our bill.  But I wouldn't go back - while it's a nice date spot in a tucked-away location, I prefer one of those \"character\" places where the prices are more do-able and the portions bigger, where the vibe is casual and the wait staff make a group booking festive."}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy. I started the night with a glass of prosecco and aperol and I feel like it was a good, light start. One of the dishes we had with dinner was the Grigliata Mista which included pork, sausage, and grass fed striploin. It came with oven roasted kale, and I was in heaven.   I wasn't a fan of the pasta special, but I also can't remember what it was -so take that with a grain of salt.   Our server was friendly and knew the dishes inside/out. The restaurant had a good amount of people in it to keep him busy, but I felt that he gave our table a perfect amount of attention and made our dinner that much better."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Had the Spareribs pasta, one of the best Italian meals I have ever had. Server was great, recommended the dish. Made the evening very nice. It will likely become one of my frequent restaurants when in the city."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday dinner (my birthday), and it was the perfect place. With relatively short notice, we were able to get a cozy little table for two at 8:30 on a Friday. Perfect! And yet, the place was certainly packed and buzzing with happy people.   The food? YUM. Warm bread started things off, which we dipped in quality olive oil and balsamic. Burrata followed and it came with apple, pear, chestnut, and rosemary. It was a light and bright starter that still felt winter appropriate.   Next, we shared the paccheri primi pasta dish with octopus, cannellini beans, pork fennel salami, tomato saffron broth. Quite al dente, but a beautiful dish. The octopus was cooked perfectly, and then costole di manzo AKA short ribs, beer, oranges, rosemary, beets and the beet greens. This was  the absolute standout for me. The meat fell off the bone and I loved the multiple beet uses.   *****"}
{"text":"If I could give it 10 stars I would.  Possibly the best Italian food I have ever tasted, including what I've eaten in Italy.  There were six of us and the owner chef had graciously agreed to serve us a tasting menu of her choice. It was spectacular.  It consisted of six or seven courses, depending on how you count, and the flavors of each course built to the crescendo of the deeply delicious back ribs and pulled pork style dish on a delicious bed of home made pasta.  Chef please forgive my crude description of the last course as back ribs and pulled pork, it was a much more complex finale than that rustic description.  Here's the food list:  Tempura battered zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta and served with pattypan squash also tempura battered.  Shaved zucchini and burrata cheese with heirloom tomatoes.  Home made egg pasta with wild boar ragu.  The back ribs and pulled pork also on a home made pasta.  Then a delicious desert board which we all swore we couldn't eat cause we were so full ... However by the time we left it appeared to have been vacuumed.  Our waitress was the delightful charming and very beautiful Kelly.   A spectacular dinner from an amazing chef. Food Channel here she comes."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful.  We enjoyed a starter with heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella and crostini with fig and apple.  Our first plate was garganelli, which is pasta with artichoke, fava beans and peas in a ricotta Parmesan sauce - the hit of our dinner.  The main plate was costole do manza, which is braised short rib with potatoes.  Wine selection was good but limited by the glass choices.  Service was outstanding.  The noise level is extremely high, the only negative to us."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is pretty good, but not on the value scale.   The entrees were pretty solid, but our appetizer was pathetic. $18 for a tablespoon of pate? Poor form. And when we shared our feedback, we were clearly told that this wasn't the first time they'd heard such comments, and yet nothing has changed - for me or the general portion size. They only offered a defense of how special it is. This ain't my first pate rodeo. The portion size is absurdly small. And when faced with a dissatisfied customer, it goes a long way to attempt to make it right - but they didn't.   All in all, I'm not opposed to Tutti Matti, but hope they become more customer centric and responsive to feedback to improve their 3 star rating from me and overall 3.5/5 star rating for the masses. It would've led to a willingness to try more courses, extend our evening and spend more money."}
{"text":"Location: It's at a convenient location and easily spotted as the colour of the building stands out in comparison to the rest on the street!   Decor: Very intimate! The lighting was very good and it felt chic and rustic at the same time. Additionally, you could see the chefs cooking from your seating!  Service: Impeccable. Our server was honestly the best. He was super attentive and made a ton of wonderful suggestions and tried his hardest to cater to my dietary restrictions. Honestly, some of the best service I've ever had in a restaurant in Toronto!    Food: We had a delicious antipasto platter with amazing apricot jam, chicken pate, rosemary pound cake (quite buttery?), tons of cured meats and olives! Very good! Then I had the wild boar ragu with pinci. The ragu tasted heavily of onions so I still am unsure of what wild boar tastes like. As for the pasta, it was next level al dente. I eat a ton of pasta but this? This was simply painful. I have no idea how I ended up chewing it it took me awhile. The short ribs were delicious but quite sweet which was a bit odd. The tiramisu was the highlight! So delicious! Small portion though.  I would come back again!"}
{"text":"It's a little on the pricey side, but we loved the food and received friendly, prompt & attentive service.   Group of 9 and everyone throughly enjoyed their orders (we got dishes across the board on the menu).  Fantastic pasta dishes and short ribs, those were highlights for me. Pasta very fresh, cooked to perfection and meat dishes were full flavoured. Loved my anchovy appetizer as well!  Fair warning that the appetizers are pretty tiny, non - sharable portions and pretty pricey (about $18 each). Mains were moderately sized for the price though.   Overall I'd recommend the restaurant for its ambiance, unique and delish food, and great service received!"}
{"text":"Our party of 12 had a wonderful meal! We literally had one of every appetizer and every meal on the menu. We all agreed that the food was prepared well, the presentation perfect and the service impeccable. A great selection of wines in all price ranges from Niagara, California and Italy.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if you have never had food from this region of Italy!!"}
{"text":"Very happy to find such delicious and expertly prepared Tuscan food in this area. Quite a contrast with the strip of touristy and generic Italian American restaurants just around the corner.  The suckling pig appetizer was delicious and a good size to split between two. Short ribs managed to be both tender and juicy inside and hard baked on the outside, I particularly liked the creamed parsnips it came with.    The cacciucco (seafood stew) is served in an individual sized Le Creuset casserole and was also excellent, with a light broth and plenty of delicious lobster, clams, mussels, etc.   A bit pricy for an every day place for us, but a good range of wines by the glass helps to keep the price down, and definitely a place to come back to regularly. My only problem in a restaurant like this is working out what to order, as I would probably enjoy every dish on the menu."}
{"text":"Visited Tutti Matti for their Summerlicious menu this past weekend and it didn't disappoint.  Cool ambiance, great service, good wine selections, and even better pasta.  I wouldn't hesitate to visit here again!"}
{"text":"Quietly spectacular meal at Tutti Matti tonight. Unique and richly flavorful parmesan/ricotta flan with mushroom sausage... soul-warming meltingtly tender shortribs with root vegetables... Brussels sprouts that were among the most richly flavored I've ever had... Comfortable, warm, welcoming ambiance... The only problem is that I've been in Toronto working for four months, and I only discovered this place on my last night! The next time I'm here, this is where I start."}
{"text":"I've now had my second prix fixe lunch here and can't rave enough about it. Enjoyed each time immensely - salads, pasta al Ragu, maremma Toscana (open face sandwich with suckling Tamsworth pig - amazing!). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was stoked to check out Tutti Matti because it's operated by one of the few female head chefs and restaurant owners in Canada. I opted for the Summerlicious menu which included caprese salad with watermelon and tomato on crostone with prosciutto, garlic and olive oil. I don't know how to express in words how magnificent this salad was, but lets just say, if I were on death row, it would definitely be a contender for my last meal on earth.   If I had left Tutti Matti having only eaten the salad, it would have been a five star rating without question. However, my next course, the hand-cut tagliatelle, was disappointing. I think this had more to do with my preference for heartier pastas like gnocchi and penne than the dish itself (and also my absurd expectations, having heard so many rave reviews of their legendary pasta) but it just didn't set off fireworks in my mouth like the salad.   For dessert, I had the budino dark chocolate mousse with canoli cookie and salted caramel gelato. Sweet baby Jesus, it was phenomenal.  Meal aside, the service was prompt and friendly. I'm looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"My fellow co-workers and I went to Tutti Matti for a holiday lunch. I have worked beside this place for 5 years and have never stepped in. Walking into the tutti Matti is like walking into a beautiful Tuscan inspired gem. The atmosphere is open yet quaint with no shortage of charm.   I found the service to be helpful but not too over bearing. The one real complaint on this front would have to be with the salad that the server suggested I have as a starter as it was that days special. I'm not shy of a good suggestion so I gave it a whirl. It had grapefruit, pomegranate, bufala mozzarella and a few other tasty items. What the server FAILED to mention was the price of this appetizer salad. $22!!!! Other than that I had the Pappardelle and it was very tasty.  Other people didn't have as good of a food experience as me. They found the fish to be very over cooked and the grains that accompanied it to be bland.   I would go back there again but probably not with a big crowd. I feel like that could have played a role in some of the mediocre meals."}
{"text":"The four of us took in a pre-theater dinner here last week and found it a mixed bag.  First of all, we had no problems with the service, which was friendly, prompt and generally unobtrusive. The room has a nice atmosphere.  We started with a cheese plate, which was tasty and went well with our wine.  Two of us had a fagottini, which is a chipea flour crepe with apples, pears, leaks, three cheeses, hazelnuts, raddichio and truffle honey. Sounded great, but I could hardly taste the various ingredients. The dominant taste was of onion (I'm guessing it was likely caramized apple and pear). Could not taste cheese at all. A bit disappointing but not a disaster.  Unfortunately, my friend had it worse with the pheasant ravioli. Bones. And the pasta was not tender, which is a complaint I've read in other reviews. Maybe it's the house style?  For my main, I had a delicious, tender beef cheek on a root veg puree. This would have been great were it not for the mounds of peppercorns that killed the flavor and texture. I scraped off most of it, but I don't think any amount served the dish at all, tastewise.  The shortribs were succulent and our other diner had halibut, which he liked a lot.  So Tutti Matti fell short of our expectations for a $80-$100/person restaurant because too many plates that had promise fell short on execution, in our opinion.  But to their credit, the staff not only comped the ravioli but also the replacement meal, which was very smart and fell in line with our customer service experience there."}
{"text":"I travel to Toronto every September for the Film Festival. A few years ago, after years of searching for good food in the Queen West area, we finally stumbled into Tutti Matti. It instantly became my mecca in what I consider a sea of mediocrity in that part of Toronto.  I just returned there two nights ago and was greeted by truly pleasant staff with whom, after we ordered, we chatted amiably. We were served promptly and -- as per usual in my experience -- were given some of the finest Italian food I've tasted anywhere (including Italy!). Their homemade pastas are unsurpassed in texture, taste and quality.  Yes, the menu is a bit on the pricey side and the portions are not gigantic, but fundamentally the restaurant is priced exactly as it should be for food of this quality. The chef and staff take their food very seriously so much so that they make annual trips to New York and Italy as a team to taste and learn from other masters of the trade.  The wine list is also on the pricey side, but don't hesitate to pick from the lower-priced wines on their list as they are excellent.  I will be back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I adore this place.... Authentic Italian cuisine.... Very nice space modern and classy. Attentive and very friendly staff... all... they act so proud and also enjoy Tutti Matti..  If i lived in Toronto this would be a weekly visit for me... Food is spectacular... the Antipasti is enough for 3 people minimum and top quality. The short ribs are simply as good as they come and are thought about days before being served no doubt... Last visit i had a Pasta with Octopus and Pork??/ Yes ??/ Wow, it was a treat....  If you have not been you must.... I will continue.."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight, it was my first and definitely the last. This place is overrated, poor service and not welcoming attitude, food is just ok and way too expensive for what they really offer. Also the decor and the feeling of the restaurant is cold. I don't recommend it"}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends last week and I am glad that we dropped by for dinner. The place nicely decorated a lot of dark wood and it had a nice vibe to it.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The place is a bit small, so if you are a bigger group I'd recommend making a reservation.  For the appetizer we had the porchetta di maremma. I recommend that everyone tries this dish at least once, it was delicious. The pork was tender and juicy and had a really great meaty flavour to it. The onions and arugula nicely offset the pork. The bread it was served on was also delicious. It was a tasty vessel to serve the pork on.  We all got pasta dishes. I tried the truffle pasta special. I liked the woodsy flavour of the truffles. The pasta was cooked perfectly. I also got to try my friends' meat tomato pasta dishes, which were all really good too. The beef was tender and the tomato sauce tasted amazing.   It's a great place to go if you're looking for good Italian food. I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"A group of six on a business trip to Toronto - we picked Tutti Matti by chance and were absolutely thrilled with the experience!  We experienced 5 different entrees during our dining, including wild boar ragu, tortelloni, costole di manzo, maiale, agnello and orata.  Every dish was beautifully presented and really delicious.  The service was outstanding, too!"}
{"text":"Tutti Matti is a great place for comforting tuscan italian food. I usually dine alone and sit at the bar here where the bartender provides helpful, gracious service to make me feel at comfortable and at ease. This is a plus as dinning alone can be a awkward experience at times met with frowns but this is not the case here.   Prices are above average-expect about $15 average for apps, pastas run from $18-21 and entrees $25-30 range.   Their pastas are excellent, all of it homemade and paired with hearty type sauces. My favourites are the pinci (hand rolled tube like pasta) with sausage or the Tagliatelle with wild boar-though last time I had this it was a touch salty. The brisket with Papardelle is very good too, nice tender strands of brisket paired with cherry tomato and fresh basil.  For dessert, I usually end with the cheese plate. All italian cheeses and you usually get at least 5-6 selections which is good variety!   All in all, this is a comforting solid place for tuscan italian food."}
{"text":"Went there with a client group on a Thursday night. Place was not as busy as you might expect. I had the beef short ribs on the waiter's recommendation. Food was quite good however found the servings a bit light for the price.  Our server was great and he knew the dishes well. Gave us a lot of attention. He works in sales during the day and it shows. Not a bad thing in this case."}
{"text":"One would think being the only paying diners at the restaurant on a Friday evening would garner better service, but that was the exact opposite. The staff was preoccupied with a staff meeting during the restaurant opening hours; albeit, we were there at 5:30pm for dinner, but one would think a staff meeting would be held during the hours when the restaurant was closed. Our server was scarce, and the only (and I'm using this generously) service we got was who appears to be the owner who was preoccupied with changing the halogen bulb over the bar and updating something on the computer. May be my experience was an anomaly, but I will find it difficult to return on my own volition.  The food portion was definitely on the lean side, but I completely understand why some restaurants choose to do this, but the display or presentation was lacking; however, the food was above average. Unfortunately, the terrible service took away from the overall experience. Did I mention that our server was difficult to locate and was eventually found to be in a staff meeting? I really didn't appreciate having to walk over to the \"owner\" to request the bill. Then I had to walk over to request the charge card machine. This is completely unacceptable! [ As an aside, maybe this was why there was a 1,000 point giveaway via OpenTable for this restaurant. I got what I paid for I guess :( ]"}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious lunch and the service was great. The restaurant wasn't too busy when we went around noon, however, filled up by the time we left around 1pm.   I ordered the radish and pear puree soup, sausage and mushroom pasta, and the chocolate caramel pudding.  - Radish and pear puree soup 5/5: the soup was a generous portion. The sweetness of the pear went well with the radish, since the radish can easily taste too \"root-like\" - Sausage and mushroom pasta 3.5/5: the pasta itself was chewy and I really enjoyed the texture. However, the flavours from the sausage and mushroom toppings was a bit underwhelming.  - Chocolate caramel pudding: 6/5: definitely the highlight of the meal - the caramel on the chocolate pudding was still liquid with every scoop, dripping off your spoon with every bite.   It was only after when we left and realized the restaurant had a regular prix-fixe menu offer at $20 (vs the $23 winterlicious lunch option). Maybe it's a calling to come again to try it out."}
{"text":"The entrees were only okay, nothing special. The server suggested we order an appetizer that wasn't on the menu. When it arrived it was disappointing and lackluster. The appetizer cost us 18$ - when it was only bread with some sauce on it, which tasted horrible... I wish he told us before hand that it would be 18$ for some bad bread."}
{"text":"-One of the best Italian foods I've had, especially in Toronto hands down (Tuscany) -Friendly wait staff -Prices aren't bad -Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cozy neighborhood spot with great ambience and warm, friendly service from the dedicated owner and chef herself.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago when a Vancouver friend of mine was in town. It was recommended to me by another friend who has consistently recommended good restaurants, and once again he came through. The food was excellent, the service was above par, and the wine was delicious as well!. If I had to make 1 comment that is not necessarily in the restaurants favour it is that was quite noisy. At one point we were virtually almost screaming across the table to be heard. Other than that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Toronto for real Italian food.  The dining room is small with a cute open kitchen in the middle of the room.  The staff is very knowledgeable and easy-going.  I treat myself to this place maybe once every few months.  The lunch menu is reasonable and there is even a fixed lunch for $14 or $15 dollars, which is silly cheap for the quality of food.  Dinner can get a little expensive with wine (in the $60-80 per person range).  The weakest part of their menu is their appetizers.  The salads are pretty uninspired.  You are better off with a carpaccio of some sort.  Pay attention to the specials though, I did have an amazing venison tartare starter once, but it was a seasonal item.    You can't go wrong with any of their homemade pastas.  My favorites are the wild mushroom with truffle oil or the tomato and beef brisket.  The venison steak is also excellent (a tad more expensive than the pastas).  An appetizer and pasta dish is plenty for one person.  You will want to save room for LEMON TART (see below).    Here are some quirks I found out about this restaurant:  1) They don't serve chicken.  Apparently in Tuscany (this restaurant is Tuscan), people don't eat chicken when they go out to a restaurant.  You won't even know its missing.  2) The chef was trained in Italy and her and some of her staff visit Italy annually.  Though she is blond, she speaks fluent Italian.  3) The lemon tart with pine nuts is probably the best food I have ever tasted, weird considering I am not a huge fan of lemon or tarts.  Huh.  This is a must for all visitors.  4) They are ridiculously unapologetic in the food they serve.  They don't win awards for being one of the most authentic Italian restaurants anywhere by serving you butter with your bread or a chicken ceasar salad.  Alice Fazooli's is down the road.  I bumped this up from 4.5 stars to 5 because I don't think the bad reviews are warranted!  The food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for special occasion. Quiet and small but with good energy. Food was delicious. We were lucky enough to be there in season for deep fried zucchini flower stuffed with ricotta. The beef short ribs were so tender you could eat with a spoon and they were dressed in a tangy rue with a hint of aromatics. The sea bream was perfectly done. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch Specialty: Italian Tuscan cuisine Menu items: Fagottini, Duck Pappardelle & Warm Bacio and Banana Lava Cake  I'm matti about Tutti Matti and everybody's crazy about it too. A cute and somewhat hidden Tuscan inspired restaurant located in the Fashion district, has created a name for itself by offering some unique and exquisite Tuscan dishes. In addition to having a rather unique name, that as you may have already caught onto translates to English as \"Everybody's Crazy\", it welcomes the downtown crowds with fresh home-made pastas, breads and daily dessert menus that will make you go matti.  Fagottini is the dish we decided on to kick-off our work week lunch. Traditionally, Fagottini is an Italian pasta shaped in squares and filled with vegetables, steamed carrots, green beans, ricotta, onion and olive oil. However, Tutti Matti decided to spin this tradition by making a phyllo style pastry using chickpea flower and stuffing it with apples, pears, leeks, three kinds of cheese, hazelnuts, radicchio and truffle honey. Although Tutti Matti deviated from the traditional way of making Fagottini, they did stick to the region's use of truffles making this dish a delicacy and a must. Tuscany is know for growing unique truffles that are used in most pasta and risotto dishes.  Skipping primi and going straight into secondi, we ventured off with the Duck Pappardelle. Pappardelle is a flat homemade noodle that is often served with rich sauces such as hare, wild boar or duck and can be found on most menus in the Tuscan region. The Duck Pappardelle was a daily special that we just had to try and it did not disappoint. The fact that Tutti Matti makes its pasta right on the premises speaks volumes, not only of the restaurant, but also of the taste of the pasta itself. It was fresh, eggy, full of taste and al dente, just how I like my pasta. The rest were just toppings. Ok, the duck was good too, but I am sticking to the noodles on this review. My absolute favourite.  My dolci does not need an intro. All I have to say its that you have to try Tutti Matti's daily dessert offerings. I had their warm Bacio Chocolate and Banana Lava Cake, topped with glazed bananas and accompanied by a home-made banana ice-cream. The perfect way to end my meal.  And if that was not enough, a spoon into the cake had me drooling yet again. The interior was not only soft, warm and sweet, but it also had little pieces of banana that made it ooey-gooey delicious.  Until next time Foodies!  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"This place is decent, but their wine list needs some work. It's not going to be booked so you can walk right in. In this area, that says a lot. Nothing bad, food was good, didn't blow me away. For the cost, you can do better. I may go back, likely won't."}
{"text":"After living in the neighbourhood and walking by it for over two years, I finally ventured into Tutti Matti.   We took advantage of the $15 Prix Fixe lunch. We got there 10 minutes shy of lunch opening. The straight-to-the-point staff said we could sit while they finish up lunch prep. For the $15, we had 3 courses - starter (choice of 2 salads, soup of the day, bruschetta), main (choice of 2 pastas, meat dish, fish dish), dessert (no choice).   I had a salad (baby spinach with red grapes, shaved grana padano and walnuts in a fruit vinaigrette), pasta (pasta with meat sauce - freshly made on site pasta), and dessert was a chilled pear and chocolate tart. The food was great despite the low price. I would've easily paid much more. The service was attentive though a bit brusque.   All in all, I really liked Tutti Matti. I wish it didn't take me two years to eat there. Now that I've experienced it, I shall be back."}
{"text":"I've walked past Tutti Matti hundred of times and never gone in. What an idiot! Everything is delicious and I can't wait to go back again. We had porchetta, burrata, pappardelle, beef short ribs with celeriac puree (the dish tasted like dessert!). Really lovely attentive service. Great wine list. The kitchen even plated up the dishes halvsies for sharing. Loved the sip of Amaro Nonino to end the meal."}
{"text":"I keep saying \"Tutti Matti\" like if I'm an especially terrible Super Mario impersonator.   I know about Italian food like I know about cars. I don't know anything about cars. So this is mostly a review from someone with tastebuds, as opposed to someone who is an expert on Italian foodstuffs.  I've waffled on the rating for a while now. But based on some fantastic service, and food that was mostly enjoyable, a very low [*][*][*][*] seems reasonable.   The first dish was easily the highlight of the meal. I can't remember what it's called, but it was like an open-faced sandwich thingie. It was rich, flavorful, and and had me excited about the rest of the meal. Sadly, everything else was just... Okay. The \"Costole di Manzo\" (short ribs) were really tender. It could have even been the most excellent part of my meal, except it was missing the most obvious of seasonings: Salt. As a result, it had an orangey sweetness to it that was almost cloying. The dessert was gelato of some sort. I gave it to one of my dinner-mates to finish. The portions are... not necessarily miniscule, but they're also on the edge of being not entirely filling.  Was the meal worth the price? Meh... Maybe. I think the excellent service carried our group through the night. Our waiter was knowledgeable, and helpful. He was chatty enough to make us feel comfortable without hovering or being phony. And he had a distinctive Italian accent that was a lot of fun to listen to. The food was decent, albeit overpriced for the offerings. In fact, if the whole meal had been like... $10 cheaper, the experience would have been better. Now I'm thinking that [*][*][*] is more appropriate. Maybe I'll change my mind again before I actually post the review... Go for lunch (or when they have a prix fixe menu available), and maybe you'll leave more satisfied than me. At approximately $50+ a person though, I expected a little more.  Random: Facebook tells me that people who like Tutti Matti's Facebook page tend to also like Snooki's page."}
{"text":"Hands down, favourite Italian in the city.  Stand-out dishes:  Pappardelle con stracotto  (hand cut pappardelle with pulled brisket, tomatoes, garlic, fresh herbs)  Tortelli di asparagi  (tortelli: ricotta and mascarpone cheese, pumpkin, mint with butter & sage)  Tagliatelle con cinghiale (hand cut pasta, wild boar stew, porcini mushrooms)"}
{"text":"Portions were really small.  Waitress was very snooty.  Food was good, but I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Best \"hand-made\" pasta in town!   Had the stoccofisso di merluzzo (Cod Fritters) to start.   It was really good, made with fresh ingredients.   Price is a little hefty, for 5 little mini balls.  Cost, $21, which comes out to be about $4.21 per ball.     Had the Pinci Pasta for my main.   This dish had me won over as the hand-made pasta noodles had these tender texture, not soggy or overcooked.  Reminded me of this flour noodles I had back home in Malaysia - that was also made fresh by hand.   I haven't found an Italian Eatery serving such a scrumptious pasta.   Cost, $23.    This is just about the same as my appetizer, which is why I can't justify paying the price I just stated above for my Cod Fritters.   Anyhow, we finished it off with Tiramisu.  Not the best I have ever had.  I love mines soaked with a bit of alcohol and this one was just too sweet and too creamy for my liking.   Might be someone else's favourite, but certainly not mines.     I would definitely come back again to try their other dishes.   I am just appalled by how fresh all their ingredients in their dish were   Tutti Matti, I am definitely \"crazy\" for you."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a colleague tonight - we're here for a conference. What a great find!!! The wait staff was really helpful, and did a good job explaining some of the more unique dishes. We started out with the fried Brussel Sprouts with pancetta- amazing!!! Perfect spices, perfectly cooked. I had the paperdelle with pork brisket. The pasta was fresh, and the pork just fell apart. Light olive oil + garlic topped it off. My colleague had the special ravioli, which she said was superb. We couldn't do desert, and I'm not sure what I'd give up so I could try a desert. Maybe I'll go back tomorrow and see."}
{"text":"This place was pretty tasty. Not my favorite Italian spot but any place with handmade pasta is a place I seek out. The menu said it was family style but all the portions were pretty small, especially the entrees! The ambiance was great and would recommend it but it's not my favorite Italian place."}
{"text":"Really expensive food for its quality. But it was okay. There is a special dinner course you can choose. Overall the food was tasty and well made. The beef was delicious and the caprise salad was great.   In conclusiom would say go elsewhere but its not too shabby"}
{"text":"I ate here during TIFF with a friend with just 1.5 hours to eat and get back to the theater. She mentioned our time crunch to the waiter when she got there. He did an excellent job of firing our courses slightly earlier than normal so we could make sure to make our screening. We both ordered the maccheroni con granchio and split the ortolano to start. The salad was excellent and the pasta was delicious. My only complaint is that I wish there was little more crab in the pasta. Because it's shredded, the flavor gets lost in the pasta."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the atmosphere is great. I had the short ribs and it was to die for!!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicious dinner on a Friday and got a really nice table in front of the open window. The ambiance of the restaurant is more upscale casual, but the food did not exactly reflect that. Starting with the chicken pate which was average, then we got the steak and the pork chops, both of which were also average. We were not asked how we wanted our steaks cooked which was odd, and they came out cut in strips with each strip cooked a different temperature. The vegetables that came with the steak were cooked in some kind of vinaigrette and it all just tasted very sour. For dessert we all chose the panna cotta which I kind of enjoyed, but was in a very tiny jar.  Aside from that we shared the prochetta appetizer from the main menu which tasted like a deconstructed pork banh mi. I would not come back here to eat from the regular menu as the prices really aren't justifiable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! An outstanding menu (not a huge food selection but what they do serve are all exceptional!), great wine selection and fantastic service (especially Linda!). Great ambiance and energy. It's clear that both staff and customers are having a great time."}
{"text":"The porchetta di maremma appetizer and the boar special were awesome! I would definitely go back next time I'm in T.O."}
{"text":"The best meal I've ever had in Toronto! My date and I split three courses and dessert, and while each was very very good, the beef short rib with parsnip puree is absolutely outstanding and a must try.   In addition, the wait staff are friendly and knowledgeable and make good recommendations for wine, of which their list is well curated and changes frequently with a good selection of organic / biodynamic / natural wines.  Overall, this is a great restaurant and one the city should be proud of!"}
{"text":"I found everything to be fresh and meticulously prepared. There is a nice selection of dishes to choose from but inline with the Tuscan inspired menu, most of them are meat-based. We ordered the fried zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta cheese, the porchetta appetizer, tagliatelle and papardelle. Everything was excellent, the flowers had a perfect crisp batter, the porchetta was moist and fatty, the pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was flavourful and complex. The portions were less than generous, which was only noticed because the prices seemed to be slightly inflated for what we ordered. The wine list definitely isn't intimidating, but doesn't miss a beat. A solid Italian option in the city, but a little more food would help."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants  in downtown Toronto. The staff was amazing and the owner and head chef took our dining experience to the next level. If you stop by, ask her to show her her steak options. The onion jelly is out of this world."}
{"text":"I had the pasta special of the day which was an asparagus and cheese ravioli and I tried my friend's fettucini. Both were delicious and the pasta was cooked to al dente perfection."}
{"text":"I just retunned from lunch at Tutti Matti.  It is true what other reviewers say - the service could be better.  We were served relatively quickly but only because we told our waitress we were in a hurry and she was clearly displeased with that.  Having said that, the atmosphere and food more than make up for the spotty service.  I started with the carpaccio.  It was just ok.  I did not find the beef to be overly flavourfull.  The best part of this dish was the mound of shaved shaved parmigiano reggiano that came with it.    My dining companion had the insalate dei matti with arugula, tuna, sautéed red onions, endive, cucumber and lemon and it was excellent (I had a little taste).  I would recommend this over the carpaccio any day.    After reading the reviews, I decided on the pappardelle with with pulled brisket, tomatoes, garlic and fresh herbs.  It was delicious.  The portion size was quite fair but not huge.  Perfectly sized for lunch.    We ended up sharing the lemon tart and it was spectacular.  Simply perfect.  Not too tart and not too sweet.  It was quite large and more than enough for three of us to share.  I would highly recommend trying this dessert.    I will be back."}
{"text":"In doing some research prior to coming here, I noticed that this place is only open from 6-10:30 Monday-Saturday, which I found a little odd. I got there at 6 and so the place was empty, a few minutes later another couple came in but we were the only 2 couples in there. There were a bunch of reserved tables but nobody else came while we were there. There are more tables in this restaurant than I expected (looks small from the outside) and they have a nice front part where the doors can open up and let a nice breeze through the place.  I wasn't sure what Tuscan cuisine was (I thought Italian was Italian), so I was looking for a nice place of pasta and tomato sauce. Turns out they don't have that there. Tuscan cuisine is more stews and sauces that have nothing to do with alfredo or tomato sauce. I was mildly disappointed but it turns out I thoroughly enjoyed this place anyways.  My wife had the antipasti special with some random stuff on it but it was really good. There was some cheese that you eat with tomatoes and basil (like bocconoci or however you spell it) but it was much more flavourful. I had the carpaccio drizzled with olive oil and some leafy greens. Very good.  For dinner it was also very good. We both had a pasta dish, my wife with had some tortelli stuffed with cheese and asparagus in a butter sage sauce, and I had some pasta with beef brisket. The noodles were home made and man were they delicious. They don't taste like anything you get out of the grocery store.  For desert my wife had this banana gelato with a lava cake and some bananas creme bruleed. Again, really good.  Of course, the only complaint I have about this place is that I think it is a tad expensive and maybe the portions could be a little bigger. But all the foods I believe taste this good with this kind of quality and flavour cost about this much, so maybe I should stop complaining about it because I'm not going to find cheaper. I appreciate the fact that the place uses in season local ingredients to make their foods.  I had no problem with the service as well. The guy was very polite, attentive and made you felt appreciated that you were there. If people want to try some not so stereotypical Italian food, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed because this was supposed to be a neighbourhood gem.   There are, unfortunately, better choices out there. For the price I paid, it was not worth it. Yes, maybe their quality is great and fresh... But the portion and lack of uniqueness in tastes was the disappointment. If I am on a diet and crave Italian sure... But I have never been on one and won't need one, so I will need some more food please.   More than 2 ingredients may just make me enjoy the dish more.   Also, I was given the sensation that they weren't very welcoming staff?"}
{"text":"This is a very solid 3.5. Toronto really needs more places like Tutti Matti: fairly priced, scratch-made, reasonably authentic Italian food in a comfortable, unpretentious, casual setting. No posers (thinking of Buca), no hipsters, no white tablecloths.  The pastas and main courses alike were very good. Not exceptional, but well above average. Only real disappointment was my affogato, which was mostly a watery mess and the \"gelato\" seemed more like Haagen-Dazs ice cream.  Also, by-the-glass pours are some of the smallest I've seen."}
{"text":"Oh, Tutti Matti was bad! Like bad-bad-bad, a huge fail on my part to check it out.  I've been in a company of my South American colleague, so we've opted to try an \"Italian\" place close to the office.  The service was... No, I won't hold it - the service was kwap. Slow, untidy and cocky. This dude was looking at us like we owed him money. So funny! And not like it was his bad day, atmosphere of the place was supporting such attitude.  The food was ordinary. Well, maybe baaarely above a completely mediocre level, but not by a serious margin. Taking in account the bill, it was way beyond overpriced.  The place itself was uncomfortable, it looked cheap and keeping in mind the bill - could be pronounced miserable.  For me, Tutti Matti was a huge waste of time and noticeable waste of money. Never more."}
