{"text":"This was an amazing meal all around.  It also brought us to one of our firsts in dining experiences.  This was the first time we had to bring home an appetizer!  We ordered the charcuterie platter for the 2 of us.  That platter is really meant for at least 4!  It was fantastic, however next time we would stick to the duck rillettes, duck terrine and fois gras terrine as they were our favorites.  Thats not to say that the others werent great as well including the pork cretons.  They also brought housemade pickled pickles, yummy.  We also had the cold tomato soup which was so simple yet really well executed with delicious tomatoes.  The french baguette was also great, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  For dinner we had the steak frites and tuna tartare (special).  Both were delicious, we could not get enough of the tartare!  We were beyond stuffed at the end of this meal and had some charcuterie for the next day!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at this trendy yet affordable French Brasserie. The dishes are inventive, delicious, and the service is attentive and very knowledgeable. Presentation is arty and elegant. The ambiance is modern and quite unique. Make a reservation in advance. Looking forward to another memorable meal here, or maybe just for dessert. They clearly understand what being in the hospitality business is all about."}
{"text":"Delicious! Excellent location. I had the flank steak and my friend had the salmon with fennel salad. Both dishes were very good. For an appetizer, we enjoyed the chicken liver mousse. I highly recommend it. Service was excellent and the atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"i want to set up at a table and gnosh all day and sample all the wines while watching the world go by.

walk in here expecting too much and you'll be disappointed. have a seat, enjoy the cozy atmosphere and pleasant service of the attentive but way-in-the-background staff and you and your party will enjoy yourselves.

if you want more, get a reservation at toque."}
{"text":"Great location right at the Place de Arts so it was fantastic to get to the comedy festival. Interesting design, kind of like a little glass box. Great views of the street life and the festival. Very friendly and efficient staff. We started with some New Brunswick oysters, the garlic sea snails and the chicken liver pate. All were very, very good. For the main course I had the beef tartare with frites and my wife had the special which was halibut topped with caviar and with deep fried clams on the side. Tried the Griffon white and red beers and both were great. Fantastic dinner on our final night in Montreal. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"When: Friday night dinner, 9:00
Crowd:  BUSY. But bar does not get too overcroweded. Which is good because its a small bar.

Restaurant setting: Sleek, modern feel. Narrow restaurant with a small bar in the front.  Great outdoor seating. Really, not built for large groups as most tables are 2 or 4 tops.  We had a group of 8, and where placed in the very front window, just near the front door and before the bar. Not a highly desirable location.

Menu: Some very intriguing items on the menu.  Range from pates, fish, and beef.  The chef recommended the special ribeye for 2 or 3. It was pricey at $75, however if split among 3 its reasonable and MUCH more delicious than the basic flank steak on the menu.  The 1 kilo of ribeye, came with some mixed green (salad) two cups of frites, and a very good bernaise.  It was AWESOME! Also, not to be forgotten was the vegetable of the day. Corn on the Cob from Quebec. May be the best corn on the cob I've ever had.

Enjoyed - The Ribeye for Two (or three) and the Corn Especially!  Others at the table had the Steak Frites (Flank Steak) and enjoyed it, just not as much as the Ribeye.  

Other:  On the downside, service was very slow. It took almost 30 minutes to get our cocktails after we ordered them, and a very long time for the final bill.  Also, dang it was HOT in that restaurant. Waiter was very nice, however.

Nutshell:  Very good restaurant. Pricey though. Might suggest a week night and outdoor seating over a busy weekend."}
{"text":"La cuisine est élaborée dans sa simplicité avec de belles propositions du jour et une carte pour grignoter ou manger à sa faim. Style brasserie pour son service, le choix s'oriente facilement et le convive ne se perd pas dans un dédale de plats. J'aime bien les propositions en fonction des légumes ou végétaux du moment, comme par exemple en mai les déclinaisons autour des têtes de violon.
Pour les gourmands des desserts, à noter une excellente tartelette citron meringuée et un Paris-Brest pour l'hiver même si sa crème très légère ne pèse pas en fin de repas.
La disposition tout en longueur, style parallélépipède, richement vitrée et aux beaux jours un espace terrasse, et son emplacement en fait une destination de choix en fin d'après-midi avant de filer au spectacle autour de la Place des Arts. Le midi aux beaux jours, le restaurant largement ouvert sur l'esplanade de la rue Jeanne Mance laisse libre cours à la rêverie au rythme des jets d'eau.
Ah oui, l'accueil est chaleureux, le service attentif sans être obséquieux. Une belle adresse."}
{"text":"We spent a lot of time researching places to eat on Montreal while on vacation and ate at some great places.  On our last night, we found Brasserie t and just loved it.  The staff was very helpful with food allergies.  More importantly the food was the best we had the hole trip.  If you are going to Montreal, see Michel de Broin's exposition and follow it up with dinner at Brasserie t."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! The service was really mediocre. The meat was undercooked (we asked for medium rare). Had a pannocota for dessert which was really average too. This place is definitely overrated! If you're looking for a great French-like brasserie go to Holder on McGill st. The Brasserie T doesn't hold a candle on Holder!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars food, 4 stars ambiance. This glass walled restaurant makes people watching (or in our case Francofolie Music Festival watching) a blast. The space is pretty loud. The portions are reasonably sized, the food is very comfort style with a facelift. I had the Saucisse Montreal with quinoa and the garlic sea snails. Both were very tasty and simply prepared. The wine menu had enough by the glass that I could find a decent pairing for each dish. The fries that my dining partner had were to die for. On a hot summer night with the concert right out the door we were thrilled. On a winter night with snow it would be truly magical."}
{"text":"Supposedly from Chef Normand Laprise, a big name in mtl cuisine, chef owner of Toqué, and mentor of Martin Picard of Au pied de cochon fame...

pedigree aside, this place was disapointing, i live nearby and have been wanting to go for a while but they are always full...

went there a few weeks ago for brunch, was disapointed. we had duck rillette, potato au gratin, bavette de boeuf and some egg special with cauliflower mash... 

maybe i don't like rillette, because i didn't like this one, the only good thing was the briochy toast that came with it. and i liked the pickles. 

the bavette was a bit overcooked, and dry, it got a little tough to cut through, i asked for medium not well done...

and it's quite pricey too, more style than substance here...

the people are pretty, and nice though :) always nice to be served by beautiful people."}
{"text":"The decor and service get five stars, but the food was not at the same level. It was very good, but not mind-blowingly good. As I was eating my dish, I was regretting that I had not chosen a more inspired restaurant; the architect and designer were better than the chef."}
{"text":"Had a very tasty Sunday brunch here recently. A little on the pricy side but it was worth it. Presentation, choice of food and the taste of the food itself is great. Went here before a show and then walked over to place des arts.

Service is quick and staff are courteous."}
{"text":"Dined at this restaurant 3 years back and it was wonderful.  Food was great this time  as well.  As the restaurant became more crowded,  waitstaff was difficult to flag down.  I ordered a tea and after a few sips, realized there was a bug in it (it happens, not the restaurant's fault).  We pointed it out to the waiter and he took the tea away.  However, when the waiter brought the bill, the tea was in the bill.  When we questioned him about this, he argued that these things happen, he then asked quizzically, \"do you want me to take it off?\"  He then took it off the bill, which should have been automatic.  After this exchange, we won't be back on our next trip.  Great food, but many other restaurants in Montreal with great food as well."}
{"text":"Where to start with Brasserie T? 

First of all, the place is modern in style but still warm and welcoming thanks to the wood implemented to the decor. You've probably heard it is small and it is true! But to me, that's one of the positive aspect of the place as you are garantied to be plunged in a great ambiance every time you visit.

Also, the staff is great! They are available but not annoying, they know what they're doing and are altogether responsible for how great the place is!

As for the food, the menu offers traditional french bistro dishes but what you get in your plate has that special Normand Laprise/Charles-Antoine Crete twist to it that makes it stand out!

My meal went as following:

Creme montee aux oeufs de Hareng:

The perfect way to start a meal! A light Creme Fraiche perfectly flavored with hareng eggs. Not too salty and refreshing, especially with a bit of lemon juice sprinkled over it.

Gratin de chevre et pomme-de-terre:

What a great dish! Tasty and fresh Goat cheese served on a moisty potato and leek biscuit topped with an homemade raspberry and beets vinegar that I am still trying to reproduce at home. This starter by itself is a reason to comeback!

Saumon a l'aneth:

The Brasserie T!'s superstar! A fresh sous-vides slow cooked salmon of perfect texture! You can tell by the subtle taste that it was marinated overnight in a oil and maple concoction that makes it melt in your mouth. It comes with a crunchy fenil salad that leaves you asking for more.

The portion are great and the prices are a deal for such quality food (around 100$ for 2 with starters, meals and a glass of wine)! Also, don't forget to try one of their  ''cocktail-of-the-hour''! All made of fresh ingredients and generously portioned, they are guaranteed to add to the \"buzz\" you'll experience at Brasserie T!

Cheers,"}
{"text":"Is OK, not special, noisy during lunch. Maybe I am too European and expecting better quality / price ratio"}
{"text":"Lovely lunch on a monday afternoon.  

We had a reservation for six, we were seated promptly, water was brought to the tabe immediately, and our server offering to take drink orders straight away.  

I ordered the escargots de mer, with garlic butter, which were delish, and the steak tartare main, which was also excellent.  

One of our group ordered the tuna tartare, and was was served the sausage by mistake...when asked about this the server apologized profusely and had a tuna tartare sent from the kitchen immediately without fuss.  

The space is amazing, the service friendly, the food delish.  Will definitely go again when I'm in montreal."}
{"text":"It's in great location & opens until midnight! 
Reservation is recommended during dinner hours as it is often packed.  Bar seating isn't comfortable, so get a table for dining.
I have been there several times & tried almost the entire menu by now.  Snails, oysters & pan seared foie gras are still my favorites! 
See my photos."}
{"text":"Endroit bien placé pour manger sur la terrasse pendant les festivals l'été. La nourriture est correcte, sans plus, malgré la présentation « fine cuisine » et le prix relativement élevé. Les tables sont trop collées les unes sur les autres, on se croirait à la St-Valentin à l'année (quiconque a déjà fait l'erreur d'aller au resto le 14 février comprend ce que je veux dire). J'y retournerais pour la vue directe sur la scène de la Place des festivals, mais pour le reste, j'ai vu mieux."}
{"text":"I will leave it to others to give la Brasserie T more than 3 stars. I is a nice place, modern and elegant, and somewhat affordable. But I think it is overhyped and overpriced; for my own taste at least. I can imagine why many people would love it though. This is the place to go for a 100% safe dinner, if you are willing to pay 10-15$ too much for it. You are 100% sure to have a good service, fancy food well presented and a clean ambience. 
Maybe for a date, to be sure to feel comfortable, safe. Not for the adventurous. 
In my opinion, there are many restaurants in Montreal where you can get better food for a cheaper price; in a less 'sanitized' environment."}
{"text":"Great location and fantastic space. This small french restaurant is located in the middle of Place des Arts and constructed from mostly glass. At night its beautiful as the city lights shine through and create a really lovely indoor/outdoor atmosphere. 

I ate here during restaurant week therefore was limited on my menu options. The food was delicious however the Taste MTL menu was nothing incredible. Good quality food, yes! But out of the world, no. However the regular menu looked and sounded delicious! Service was great, the wines were very nice and I enjoyed my evening.

If you are interesting in going, I would recommend booking. Especially if you are a larger group."}
{"text":"This place is always packed in the summer. Super location right on the Place des festivals. Bright ambiance with super good service. Being the little Toqué! food is excellent. Try the poèlée de champignons for a very soothing appetizer. It's mind blowing. It's certainely not cheap, but if you can get in, it's worth a try. Good selection of wines by the glass. Interesting that the prices for a glass, half bottle of bottle come up the the same cost per glass; that way, you don't feel ripped by the cost of 2 glassed compared to a full bottle."}
{"text":"This place is strange, but just in terms of architecture. 

They are in the middle of the square, and have a very nice patio, and in doors glass see through walls. 

I sat at the bar and the bar tender was very good. The sea snails were very good and their drinks are quite awesome to say the least."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch after finding no decent restaurants while shopping on St. Catherine. So glad we stopped here. 

You already know it is small from the other reviews, but it truly isn't as small as others mentioned. Perhaps because we dined on the patio which offered great people watching. 

I had the shrimp roll which was delicious and a perfect lunch. My husband had the flank steak which was also tasty. Loved the salsa verde on it.  Again, perfect for lunch. Both were served with fries which were yummy. 

All in all, a delicious lunch."}
{"text":"The prices were a little high and the flank steak was unimpressive.  Interesting location with nice views of the park.  We had a reservation and got seated right away and had good service all night."}
{"text":"Went here based on advice from Anthony bourdain. It was a perfect spot for what my boyfriend and I were looking for; a quick quiet casual and tasty meal. The sparkling red wine was delicious. The building itself kind of reminds me of a subway station haha...Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Seriously? $20 for a small lunch dish? There's nothing really spectacular here other than the restaurant space itself and the fact that it's built on a friggin' sidewalk. That, and the waitresses are cute."}
{"text":"The location is great (being in the centre of Places des Arts), and the decor is great. They have really good cocktails but the food is just below average. Go there for the drinks and the ambience, not for the food."}
{"text":"I came to this place with my wife on a thursday night back in July. I liked the place, the food and the service. One of the most difficult things to find in this continent is a good beef tartar and this one I did enjoy! My wife was also pleased and we had a really good time."}
{"text":"Son point fort: l'emplacement et la sangria!
Oui l'emplacement est parfait! Un restaurant construit de mur en verre donnant sur la place des arts, quoi de mieux, vous me direz?
Mis à part cela, l'espace est petit et la nourriture correct. Pourtant la note est salée à la fin... Mais en bonne compagnie, on y passe très agréable soirée!"}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoyed every course of our meals.  Starting with the waite staff and ending with desert,  every part of this experience was delicious.  The non-alcoholic cocktail that included thyme, lime, strawberries and purple basil, it was absolutely delish.  The guaspacho thrilled my tongue, and the butternut squash ice cream was great.  We will definitely make a reoeat visit"}
{"text":"It was a good place to eat dinner.  Enjoyed the Hahaha festival while enjoying dinner. I had the flank steak and I was good."}
{"text":"I've never been to Toque!, because I'm not so much for meat, foie gras or other parts of animals. But, when my friends decided to head to Brasserie T, and we scanned the Yelp and other reviews and decided it might be OK to check it out. 
I've eaten at my share of big-name chef restaurants, but often I've been disappointed. (Chuck Hughes a huge exception!) 
But, I left here wanting recipes to recreate my favorites at home! 
The mushrooms with egg was the perfect simple dish, well made and yummy. The salmon tartar should have been offered with a loaf of bread, but I stepped up myself and stole the slices of bread. 
I even had to have dessert based on the excellent reviews. Berry clafoutis was ideal way to end the meal. 
I'd definitely go back. The atmosphere is super- casual.  
Service, for such a small space, could certainly be better."}
{"text":"Awesome. 

The food at brasserie T was amazing. The \"GOAT CHEESE + POTATO GRATIN\" appetizer absolutely blew my mind - it was such a perfect balance of rich flavors and so well done. the \"Shrimp guédille + fries or salad\" was light and flavorful - very refreshing for a summer night. The \"FLANK STEAK + TOQUÉ! BUTTER + FRIES\" was also absolutely awesome - the steak was super flavorful, though the butter was a touch too strong for us. The one complaint would be the size of the steak - portions were not generous, but the quality more than made up for it.

The apple crumble desert was so light and sweet and delicate - amazing. 

The atmosphere is great - its a small, clean and new little spot, just popped down on the corner. 

Really fantastic experience."}
{"text":"First let's start with the good - great location right in the heart of downtown. Cool vibe being all in glass and for people watching. Place was buzzing and it had a fun \"after work\" kind of feel. On the good front the oysters were great, the salmon tartar, the poached egg with wild mushrooms and the French fries were all incredible. So was the mixed drink which had such a complex taste profile. On the negative side, tables are close together and the lighting was a little bright for my taste. Food - I'm sorry to say we thought the burger was terrible. Very dry and overcooked when we ordered medium rare. Not one bit of pink. Also the side of vegetables in contrast were so undercooked they were basically raw (and they were root veggies so that's not a stylistic thing) and I noticed the person next to me sent hers back. All in all this was okay for me. I wouldn't go back but it really wasn't my type of restaurant so it may be a matter of taste."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the experience was mostly ruined by the abysmal service (I should have trusted the many reviews that repeatedly complained about the service!)

We were met by the smileless maitre'd. We asked the waiter for some advice, but he mostly read the menu aloud (we could do this ourselves, thank you very much). I ordered a cocktail, and some foreign body was floating in the glass. OK things happen, so I asked the waiter to replace it. At this price range of the restaurant, I'd expect him to smile apologetically and replace it without any fuss. Well, not here at Brasserie-T. He started to argue that this obviously foreign body is part of the green leaf, which was floating in the cocktail. I asked him to replace it anyway.

Then the most hilarious part comes. The waiter took the glass away, and my wife observed him removing this foreign thing with his hand (sic!). Then he brings it back, and ... starts to argue again. Now he says it fell into my cocktail from the tree while he was bringing it. Well, we were indeed sitting under a tree, but I don't really care if it's from a tree, or a bird, or anything else - this junk clearly didn't belong in my cocktail. I asked him to just bring me a new glass. Amazingly, unbelievably he continue to argue. At this point I just got sick and tired of it, and just refused the cocktail.

Again the food was decent, but the overall experience was pretty poor.  There are lots of great restaurants in Montreal. Just look elsewhere.

Update: later that day we had dinner at Bouillon Bilk, and the difference was night and day, as the latter was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Attracted by reputation i was eager to try la Brasserie T. 
I'm gonna be disapointed to say the least.
You pay 3 times the price, and no exceptional decoration nor good service nor super delicious and good portion of food does justify it.

You have impression of eating in a big container on the sidewalk near place des arts

I had dory fish and it was ok witjout beeing exceptional. My girlfriend had salmon tartar and it was barely ok. 

The service is good and the plates looks good.

I choose to go there for my birthday and i was disappointed a lot.

Needless to day i won't come back.


Attiré par la réputation du resto j'avais hâte d'essayer la Brasserie T. Quelle déception ni le décor, le service et la nourriture ne justifie un prix trois fois trop grand avec si peu de nourriture !

On a l'impression de manger dans un conteneur ou bien une roulotte, ce qui a mon avis n'est pas un bel environnement.

Mon assiette de poisson (doré) était ok sans être exceptionnelle, bien présentée mais assez ordinaire côté goût. Ma copine a manger du tartare de saumon qui était ok sans plus.
 
Le service est très bon et la presentation des assiette est très bonne.

Bref c'était ma fête et c'est moi qui ai choisi le restaurant mais j'ai été amèrement déçu.
 
Je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Came here twice with friends. The menu didn't hold many items but the best dish so far is their salmon tartare with fries. It has a very refreshing sourish taste. Would be great if it came with more croutons. Their other dishes are pretty decent also. 

The place is located in the center of the Quartier des spectacles, next to Place-des-arts metro. The restaurant is narrow and long but has a nice atmosphere. 

Would definitely recommend this place, especially if there are festivals next to it."}
{"text":"Two words - BEEF TARTAR! This is one of the best ones I ever had. Be aware that they don't serve it between 2pm and 5 pm due to high evening demand. Great service, great food, beer and wines. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The steak was modestly priced but wasn't exceptional. Not bad to go to prior to a show but don't expect toque. It's a brasserie that shares the owner that's about it."}
{"text":"Le concept est cool , mais les plats sont plus dispendieux seulement a cause du nom du chef et de l'emplacement ! Je pense qu'il y a des endroit meilleures dans le coins avec une meilleure qualité/prix !  De plus, le service n'etait pas très bon ! 

Bref comme je dis la place est bien, car elle donne directement sur la place des festivals, mais je n'ai pas l'impression que les plats valent le deplacement !"}
{"text":"Great location, right next to the Place des arts. My friend and I stopped there for a drink and also grabbed a quick bite.  The hamburger was great, made will real beef (not a processed patty) and I was even able to getting it cooked the way I want (medium baby!).  Atmosphere is not the best, but the service was nice and food ok."}
{"text":"Had a good lunch. Montreal pork and duck sausage and a quinoa. Was excellent. Cool menu. Friendly service. Very cool setting."}
{"text":"Brasserie T holds 3 stars from me for one reason: Location. 

Like many others have complained, service is sub-par and oftentimes very cold. No one there seems to be interested in doing their job and they hardly pay attention to you. However, whenever I go, I don't ask for much -- I get a spot on the patio, take a drink or two and order my salmon tartare, and leave with a smile on my face. 

I know what I want and what I'm going for, so I don't get too fussy about the other stuff. Granted, others surely will, and for good reason."}
{"text":"Bon service. La cuisine est correcte, sans plus"}
{"text":"Like this place for a casual lunch.  Normally take the steak tartare or the salmon tartare.  The accompanying fries are usually good, but on a couple of occasions the fries weren't as good.  Think they needed to change the oil...."}
{"text":"A tad overrated. Don't get me wrong - food was great, service was friendly and by all measures on point. Portions were a bit small, and nothing was particularly outstanding... 

We ordered the seafood tower to share ($80) which was tasty but aforementioned was a bit too pricey for what we got. My main was the sausage on quinoa - again, tasty but nothing phenomenal to warrant $19 dollars.
Tasty. Bang for buck? Nope."}
{"text":"Small and beautiful modern restaurant. From the hostess to servers to managers to waitress, the service were very friendly!

It's a Birthday dinner for my sister; we all ordered our own drinks and each of them were good. Now food wise: I had the oysters (excellent), poached salmon with fennel salad (salmon very bland but nice and soft, melts in your mouth, salad is very good), Chocolate puff (horrible after taste; smoked salmon kind; waitress was notified). My dad had the burger and fries; he seemed very confused about the taste of the meat and the fries were very good. My sister had the pulled pork salad; she said it wasn't good; she couldn't not finish her dish. My mom enjoyed thoroughly her fish of the day special. And the Birthday girl has the duck and pork sausage which was average and again the fries were very good. My both sisters had the chocolate puff; they felt the same way, the after taste of smoked salmon ruined the whole dinner.

A note on the side, we told the waitress twice it's my little sister's birthday, but they never brought a candle. So we had to ask another server, if they have a candle. The candle was brought and lit and the server walked way. This is the first time ever I have seen the restaurant didn't seem to care about someone's birthday. Every other restaurants, the servers would sing with us the happy birthday song. It was a major disappointment. I am still stunned how it wasn't important aspect of the restaurant as a service. Obviously, the desert was charged on our bill; any other would never charge for it. 

In conclusion, do not go there if it's someone's birthday. Our feelings for food tastes are average. Some good and some not good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a review of the food or drinks but I simply can't.  As regulars at the Montreal Jazz Fest my friend and I have been hoping to try T!.  We arrived at 9:05 on Thursday night. There were plenty open tables. We sat and had water glasses filled and that is where this review should end. From that moment on we were completely ignored.  The staff walked past a few time but even as we tried to get some attention , we were ignored. We left after 30 minutes of complete ignorance.  After we left, we did see our waitress chatting with some one outside of the restaurant for over 5 minutes.  We also saw after we left, a couple sit at the table we had left and be served drinks, have bread at their table and make their over in just over 7 minutes.  Very Disappointing"}
{"text":"Été 2017
2 visites cet été, en mai et en septembre. Menu beaucoup moins intéressant pour les option végés. 1 seul choix et une salade en plus. Costaude et nutritive mais rien de renversant par rapport à la réputation de la place. 2e visite, je souhaitais voir un menu corrigé et amélioré. Finalement j'ai dû composer avec que des entrées. Savoureuses mais dispendieux pour un plan B. Souhaitons que 2018 sera +++ audacieux et à l'écoute de la clientèle.

Été 2016
Un décor minimaliste submergé de fenêtre au coeur de la Place des Festival, c'est tellement actuel, urbain et unique à Montréal. L'expérience débute très bien. Le service est assuré par un personnel très sympathique et de bons conseils. Beaucoup de viandes au menu, mais la perle parmi ces mets est la salade d'haricot romano et légumes. Un must pour tout végétalien épicurien. On y retrouve la salade d'haricot sous une montagne de légumes grillés frais, le tout nappé d'un chutney d'aubergine. Un trio infernal, j'en rêve encore! Comme entrée végétarienne, le gratin de chèvre et pomme de terre est succulent. Un bloc d'un style de pomme de terre à la dijonnaise (pas sûr du tout du nom exacte) extrêmement crémeux et goûteux, sous une couche de feuilles vertes et d'une rondelle de chèvre grillé. Deux trios végés gagnants, de quoi rendre envieux le Canadien de Montréal! La bière de micro brasserie et le rioja Espagnol ont arrosé le tout sublimement. J'y retourne cet été pour me retaper ce même menu, c'est garanti!!!"}
{"text":"Started with Sea Snails, Pan Seared Foie gras, and Mushrooms w soft boiled egg. Phenomenal. Each of them. 

Entrees were flank steak and Coquilles San Jaques. The latter was the best.

Paired everything with a Sancere (do that) and a Bourgogne Pinot Noir (very old world)

Highly recommend what we ate.

Service was wonderful, with waitress explaining food, recommending wine perfectly, and even offering to take our photo for our memories.  We made reservations through Open Table, the day before. Proximity to comedy festival was a plus. 

(I noticed reviews by people who were not able to walk in off the street. Ignore those reviews. Stay classy.)"}
{"text":"Idéalement situé au cur du quartier des spectacles, la Brasserie T est d'abord original par sa disposition \"en aquarium\" comme je l'appelle.. en effet, ça a l'air d'un aquarium géant posé sur la rue (si vous vouliez passer inaperçu, c'est loupé! ;) )
Les menus sont conçus par les chefs du Toqué! (meilleur resto à Montréal ou presque) donc on ne peut être déçu!
Il y a un choix raisonnable de plats raffinés
Tout le monde y trouve son bonheur, il y a des options végan aussi
Les desserts aussi sont délicieux
Les prix sont raisonnables, surtout pour la qualité des mets, du service et le quartier
Bref, à essayer! :)"}
{"text":"food was good! we enjoyed it but the escargot was smelly in a way it might've been old? not sure but not the normal escargot i have had before."}
{"text":"Same amazing food, shitty,  below-standard service. You need to get the soft boiled egg and mushrooms. I know this is a probably overhyped Bourdain dish, but it hits the mark so well. Spicy salmon tartar was good, and fries were great as usual. Cheese plate was depressingly lackluster.

In contrast to my previous experience, our server was cold and appeared bored with us. I detected what I perceive to be some anti-American bias; we were written off for most of the meal while other Québécois diners around us clearly got priority. This is the unfortunate reality of dining in Montreal sometimes: snooty, shitty attitude and service when the only thing you've ever done is lived in another country. We weren't obnoxious, rude, or demanding at all. Support staff did a great job, but the server needs to get her head on straight. 

One bad server isn't going to keep me away, though. The food and atmosphere are the draw here, and I will happily be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite french restos in Montreal. I come here at least once every time my mother is in town. Their tartars are amazing and the ribs are delicious. They serve mayo with their fries - won my European heart in an instant. Great drinks and wine menu! very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Well located and perfect for a quick meal before a show at La place des arts ! The menu has tavern crowd favourites such as beef bavette and a good drink selection in a casual but classy environment. That being said it doesn't have a soul and is not really memorable. I personally had the fish and chips, the fries were exceptional but the fish was pretty average and felt more of an oven baked fish then a classic fish and chips. I would probably go back before another show because it is really convenient!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good restaurant. Very clean and nice. Kinda small. Portions are big and the service is excellent. They have the best view during the summer. The terrace is right in the middle of Place des Arts. During festival season, it's the place to be."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Amazingly creative cuisine artfully presented. Fabulous adventure for our group of 9 Fundraising Conference attendees."}
{"text":"Interesting building, cool location.  Actually right down the block from a nice little brewpub, Benelux, which is a good pre-meal spot and 5 minute walk.

My wife started with the escargot and garlic butter, which was very good and had 8-10 snails.  I had the gazpacho, which was not the best I've had but still good.

We were unsure of what to order, since the selections all seemed delicious but settled on the steak special for two, which included long beans, heirloom tomato salad, and fries for $90.

The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was well seasoned.  The size was more than enough for the two of us (there was a larger size available for $15 more).  The fresh tomato salad was simple yet amazingly dressed with a light vinegar, basil and onions.  The fries were actually the most crisp fries of the trip.

Overall, this was the best meal of our trip.  Every plate was good to great and the service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hungry and exhausted from a day of touring the city, my boyfriend and I stumbled from the nearest Bixi station into this New York Times-recommended French bistro. We had a 10:00pm reservation (the earliest slot available on Opentable that summer Saturday) and were eternally grateful when they could seat us at 9:30pm. To our surprise, the restaurant was far from packed, although outdoor seating was mostly taken.

The food was really good. We didn't order any entrees; Instead, we got the charcuteries platter (good to share between two people), which included duck rillettes (divine with caramelized onion), foie gras terrine, cured ham, and pork saucisson. Some of the charcuteries were only ok, but some were amazing too... The foie gras rivaled the pate at NYC's Bar Boulud. Additionally, we ordered two corns on the cob (light, simple, delicious with butter and salt/pepper) and a side of fries (very tasty). Our meal ended up being approx $70 with a glass of beer.

As far as French bistro cuisine goes, Brasserie T definietely succeeded in the charcuterie. However, there are little things about the ambiance and service that threw our experience off.

- First, we were seated at a table with no tabletop candle or overhead light. It was so dim that we couldn't read our menus. We requested a table change and got moved to a window table that had a harsh overhead white light (compared to the soft yellow lighting other tables got). Slightly annoyed but too embarrassed to request another table change, we stayed put. But it elicited grumbles from my boyfriend.
- Second, it took foreeeeeever to flag our server down for the check. It was as if she forgot about us after our orders were put in.

Based on the hype (from the Toque connection and NYT review) and menu prices, I had certain expectation about the restaurant as an overall experience. Brasserie T tried to meet those expectations, but it fell just short. Certainly not bad but certainly not amazing."}
{"text":"Located next to place des arts, it's a convenient place to eat prior to a show. Unfortunately it's pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"Actually came upon this place trying to find somewhere I could meet the feeble alotment for my company meal travel policy.  Found the menu online and decided this was definitely better than any number of nearby restaurants price-wise.  While I could have met the meager limit set by my company, I quickly decided to go beyond for my own enjoyment after perusing the menu once seated.
I had a glass of Reisling with the pan-seared foie gras and then a Valpolicella with flank steak, and everything was truly superb.  The wines were excellent, the foie gras was an excellent decadent treat with a side dab of what I believe was pureed squash to balance out the fatty goodness of dearly departed Donald, and the flank steak had a butter/dill/sage (I think?) topping that really balanced that out nicely as well.
The servers are all very polite and helpful, a decided bonus for the english-speaking Anglophile in French-Quebec.  All told, I walked out of there at about $55, which is really a bargain when you take a look at the price list at comparable places.  
I will now be hitting the gym, sauna, and possibly examining bulemia after this indulgence, but I would definitely go back once my cholesterol drops back below 400lb man levels."}
{"text":"I was excited about catching up with a friend I had not seen in over a year and what better place to do so than at a restaurant that has intrigued us both. I've walked by this location over the last few years and always thought that it resembled a métro entrance with its long and narrow shape, glass walls and contemporary form. It definitely fits the Place des Arts/Quartier des Spectacles surroundings. Inside the restaurant, guests can catch glimpses of passers-by who amuse themselves with an adult see-saw / light installation that is disciplined in its design but still able to evoke joyous childhood memories.

We were the first ones in but were perplexing led one of the worst tables in the house, next to the coat rack, near the waitstaff station.

After reviewing the curated menu that included oysters, snails in garlic sauce, cheeseburger and sausage, I settled on the special of the day: red snapper fritters and lamb burger, at a wallet-friendly price. 

The three bite-sized fritters, while technically well made, were overly salty. The same can also be said of the lamb burger. I thought that perhaps it was due to dehydration but the fries were perfectly seasoned, and actually, perfect in every way. Fried to a light golden, they were just crispy enough with a tender interior. Yum, I could have another plate with mayo right now.

We all had the Paris-Brest pastry for dessert. Other choices included ice cream, carrot cake, chocolate crème brûlée, and apple cranberry tart. I liked the rich and nutty flavor of the hazelnut pastry cream but thought that the choux was a bit soggy. I did notice that the restaurant was a bit humid (condensation clung to the windows) and wondered if that had an impact.

Service was okay."}
{"text":"I heard about this place but I wasn't looking for it when I was walking around the area.

Stopped in for a quick snack of sorts, I was going out to dinner later on with some friends but needed something to hold me over.  What is better for a quick snack than some oysters and a beer? The oysters were pretty fresh but they were pretty pricey, I wish they had some more beer choices to accompany the oysters better.  Otherwise I might stop in again in the future if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by this restaurant. My fish, although tasty, was very difficult to cut and had an odd texture. The choux of the paris-brest was extremely dry and tasted like it was made yesterday.. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner just before seeing Aziz Ansari at Metropolis. Made reservations for 7:30pm. Great setting just next to Place des Arts as the JFL Festival was going on outside. Waitress was very helpful and service was great. The food was excellent as well. Had the snails, oysters, and ribs. All were excellent. Will come back and try more things in the future. A must try although may be touristy for some."}
{"text":"Way overrated
I hope you love waiting. You will have to deal with several untrained, not really caring waiters/waitresses before to be served industrial charcuterie, Costco type steak with passed out fries and supermarket sauces. No fresh but certainly overpriced products. No wonder, profit margin either goes to the fancy location rent, or to the owners pocket. The pleasure is definitely not yours."}
{"text":"We got into town after a day of driving from Toronto and wanted to eat somewhere not too far from our hotel. On a lovely fall Friday evening there wasn't a wait and we decided to try Brasserie t. We weren't disappointed. The service was top notch and just the right amount of solicitation.  The location was also awesome since the recent spotlight art installation had been installed across the street for Le Parterre in the Quartier des spectacles. We started with the pan seared fois gras and wow - having both never had it before it was divine! My boyfriend had the Coquille St. Jacques which was a tasty seafood dish sitting in a small pile of mashed potatoes and baked in a shell - the shell was sitting on salt which was neat. I had the Pork ribs which were very tasty. All in all a great meal in a great town."}
{"text":"Don't eat here if you are pregnant:  Negligent, rude waitress, provides poor service.

Brasserie T has been my all time favorite restaurant in Montreal for the two years I have lived here.  I take my office out here once every quarter to treat colleagues , bring business associates to lunch, my husband and I have dinner from time to time, and it is the very first place on our list when friends and family come to town. But our treatment today was truly terrible.  I left at 10% tip - something I have never done since I have also worked as a waitress and know how hard the labor is.

Due to morning sickness, I had not been in about two months.  On arrival, I explained to our waitress, Marie Eve, that I was expecting and needed to know if the salmon confit in the daily special was fully cooked through, and whether there was any raw egg in the gazpacho.  She stated that the salmon was cured and then slowly cooked just like in the regular salmon and fennel dish that Brasserie T offers on its regular menu, and would pose no problem.  I was astonished, since I have had salmon and fennel dish many times, and while truly delicious, it is cured and therefore not suitable for pregnant women.  I asked Marie Eve if she knew whether there was any raw egg in the gazpacho, which some recipes use.  She said she did not think so, but did not offer to check.  I asked if she would please confirm with the kitchen.  Later, she came back to take our order, and I asked  \"Is it okay for me to have?\"  She nodded absently.  Unconvinced, I asked her if she checked with the kitchen as promised.  No, she had not, she said.  The restaurant wasn't full - we'd been there already for 20-25 minutes.  Again, could she please check?  She left, annoyed, and came back, and said it did not include the egg.  

I ordered the gazpacho and a medium burger, and asked to have half fries and salad, something I have done every time I've been to lunch at Brasserie T for the past two years.  She then refused to take the order in this way, and said I would have to pay extra.  I said I had done this many times at lunch, and asked if this was a different practice at dinner than at lunch.  She became very insistent, and said I was wrong (!!!), that it was a policy at Brasserie T for all meals, since it opened, to only serve either salad or fries with the burger, and that I could add a side order.   I could talk to a superior if I did not believe her.  I was shocked, and stated that I understood she would not accept this, and was happy to make a separate extra order, but she should understand that this is the first I have ever heard of this practice, am a loyal customer, and am not lying about my past experience.  She sighed and glared at me.  I smiled back.  At that point, she finished taking our orders and did not speak to us again, except for 30 minutes later to ask if the four of us, all of whom ordered fries, would like one ketchup or one mayonnaise to share as a condiment.  (Again, Brasserie T has always offered us both without asking!!)  Belatedly she came by with one lonely half filled ketchup dish.   We asked for mayonnaise, she never brought it.   She never brought bread plates to my husband or myself - just to the other people in the party.   Three of four orders of meat were considerably overcooked. - we just ate, knowing it would be useless to engage again the obstinate Marie-Eve.  Other servers brought the dishes with the normal standard of courtesy we expect from Brasserie T.  Marie-Eve only returned to take our dessert order, and never told me that the item I ordered was garnished with - you guessed it - raw egg in the form of fresh meringue!!  We got up to leave the terrace at the end of the meal, and as we walked over the threshold into the restaurant, Marie Eve was in our path walking with one drink to serve on the terrace.  Instead of stopping to let us pass, and thanking us for coming, she glared at us and barreled right through our group.

The last thing I will note is that in all of my previous visits to Brasserie T, I have ordered and interacted in French with the waitstaff.  With English speaking guests we chose to speak in English.  I really cannot explain why we were treated with such utter indifference  - either Marie Eve is new and needs to learn basic manners or there is a different standard of service for English speakers at Brasserie T.  Based on my past experience at Brasserie T, I don't think they discriminate on the basis of language, but someone less familiar with the restaurant could draw that conclusion if they had a similar experience with Marie Eve.   Same for someone with legitimate dietary concerns trying to make the best choices possible - they might feel like the restaurant would rather not serve them. 

Instead of Brasserie T, we will now head back to M sur Masson in Rosemont, or O'Thym at Berri UQAM - both offer some similar choices, and dedicated wait staff that makes every effort to understand the customer's needs"}
{"text":"Located right outside the place des art metro station in these modern like boxes. They also have outdoor seating to enjoy the weather and the water fountains. For the foreigners, Place des arts is like the Lincoln center of Montreal. As for the food, the highlights of the night was the whipped cream and herring eggs as well as their frites. This place serves some of the best fries I've had. The fries were perfectly crispy and perfectly sized, not too thick or thin. The potato au gratin was a bit non- traditional but still decent.  Overall food is good, but probably wouldn't recommend any out of towners to go out of their way for this place."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day with my boyfriend, and it was a wonderful night.

We started with garlic sea snails, beef tartare and a soup. They were very tasty and decent. However, the main dishes were just average. We had the Montreal sausage and flank steak, and the sausage was a kind of too salty for me..

The service was warm and attention, and all the dishes were explained to us before we ordered."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible.  I took one bite of steak and then proceeded to spend the next 15 minutes chewing it.  Flank steak can be succulent and tender if cooked properly.  After sending it back sans one bite and telling my waiter that I didn't care for it, I was still charged for it.  Class act, Brasserie t!"}
{"text":"Very good food the garlic sea snails were amazing ordered oysters also very good but the lady who seated us at first was abit rude not finding us a place when the restaurant is empty just cause we have a pushchair with us"}
{"text":"Small space, teeny ( but delicious) portions, very loud ambience, and A/C that barely worked made for mediocre experience. The service was a spotty at best and frankly just felt that perhaps our table just didn't fit the young, hip demographic they typically serve. So wanted to love  the experience but walked, no actually ran, from the place. Disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations,seeing that their parent restaurant Toque! was ranked best in Canada.
We ordered off the Mtl a table menu, which was prix fixe at $31. Since it was an opportunity for restaurants to showcase their food, I expected nothing less than the regular menu quality.

The appetizer was pissadielere with smoked sturgeon. It was topped with caramelized onions and arugula alongside the sturgeon. I found that the onions overpowered the fish, which I was not able to distinguish except for a bit of smoky flavour. As the dish was supposed to feature the smoked sturgeon, it was not what I expected.
The main was salmon with polenta and chimichurri. The salmon was exceptional! The inside was tender and not over nor under cooked, possibly cooked sous vide? The outside was perfectly seared to a thin, even crisp. However, the excess chimichurri overpowered the other components, while the polenta was smooth and creamy, but too salty. The arugula served as a balance against the strong chimichurri, but lost the flavour battle nonetheless.
Finally, the dessert was cherry clafoutis and apple raspberry tartlet. They were exactly what I expected, delicious and simple! You could choose to end the meal with a satisfying scoop of ice cream on the hot clafoutis, or a stimulating tart with the perfect sour and buttery tones.

Service was great, not invasive and helpful when you need them. All the dishes were explained to us before we ordered! Water was also refilled frequently. 
Atmosphere was relaxed, even though the restaurant is very small. Not exactly roomy, but the open glass on all sides worked well."}
{"text":"We had a romantic weekend in Montrèal and this was our choice for an afternoon lunch. My wife had the excellent steak tartare salad along with some oysters. I had a cauliflower soup. The wine, food and atmosphere where perfect."}
{"text":"During our trip to Montreal we wanted to visit Brasserie T but were not in the  market for their dinner prices.  We came at lunch instead and had a wonderful meal for much less than we would have paid to eat dinner here.  My friend had Coquille St. Jacques and I had a small steak.  Both were delicious.  We had a hard time finding the restaurant at first (we thought it was part of a museum) but  maybe we just didn't think that it would be a glass box.  It was a beautiful day when we came, and it Brasserie T has a very cool ambiance.  I would definitely recommend checking it out for a fancy lunch!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great wine, great service, but ultimately i found the food hit & miss for the price - especially with no clear huge winners among any of the dishes we ordered.  A potato / chevre gratin was overpowered with beet juice & deconstructed in an all-too-cold way (literally cold) - 

steak frites & salmon tartare was good, but just, well, about that.

the best part of the dining experience was just being in the ultra-hip building - just a long glass rectangle.  next time i'd want to come back just for a drink."}
{"text":"Two drinks, a mediocre goat cheese salad and the bill with tip was 40+ bucks. The goat cheese salad required assembly, and literally took 20 minutes to come out. It is an interesting space, but won't be returning."}
{"text":"We went there the other night and had a great time.  We got a solitary table by the glass but still inside which is the way to go around sunset.  We could see people needing to adjust outside in the sun.

We started off with a glass of the viognier bubbly which was crisp and refreshing.  For dinner we had a nice sicilian red which wasnt too heavy.

We kicked it off with the fried cheese which was a nice small plate go start.  Very salty but yummy.  Vicki got the goat cheese gratin with beet sauce.  She liked it but thought it had a bit too much goat cheese.  I had the lamb carpaccio with a mayo drizzle and grilled veggies in the middle.  The lamb was actually cooked but was very good nonetheless.

But the best part was the main.  I had the flank steak.  Not too big a piece of meat and perfectly cooked at medium.  But the absolute highlight were the fries.  These may have been the best frites we've ever had.  Crisp, tasty and well sized we would go back just to get s side of these...and we just might.  Vicki was very happy with the merguez which had citrus roasted peppers and onions that were quite unique and delicious.

Our waiter was attentive and made good recommendations.  It should be in a montreal rotation without question"}
{"text":"Wow. Service has NEVER been so atrocious... As someone who works in the industry, I can't believe there is so little quality control over the staff this place hires. No smiles, no warm welcomes, no thank yous... Just everything delivered with attitude or indifference. Our server must have forgotten that paying customers are not there to service the staff & that it's actually the other way around. She had the audacity to stop me on the way back from the bathroom to say, \"thank you for your generosity\" in response to the tip we left. Sure, the tip was low but we thought it reflected the kind of service we experienced (or lack thereof). We racked up a $160+ bill midday so the fact that we were treated like a nuisance was unbelievable. As I began to explain our reason for the tip, she rudely snipped, \"ok, bye.\" I'm sorry, chef, that she is representing your food & restaurant...we returned to Brasserie T because we enjoyed it immensely the first time. We certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"This proved to be a nice find, especially because the special the night we were there was veal liver. Ok, liver is not for everyone, but if you like liver, this was truly exceptional. 

For dessert, I had a glass of Grand Marnier, and it was a generous pour. High marks!"}
{"text":"The food were expansive and we knew we were paying for the view and location. Our waitress knew we couldn't speak French and she got us a \"simplified\"  English menus. I wish they have a better English menus. We ordered sea snails which were pretty good. Foie gras was very generous and they gave us a lot of bread. The salad was ok. I asked the waitress to explain the foods and she wasn't able to reply in English. So she just explained in French, which we didn't understand. Guess it is our fault."}
{"text":"Vraiment délicieux. Le repas paraissait simple, mais surprenant en bouche. Nous avons pris la bavette et le saumon et nous sommes tomber en amour. Vraiment bien! À essayer sans faute,"}
{"text":"Standard French food without an edge.  The food lacks a bit of creativity. Service is excellent. Cocktail menu is limited."}
{"text":"Ok sans plus.
Avec pourtant encore une reputation qui fait l' envie d' autres restaurateurs ,j'ai été déçu ainsi que mes amis (8)
Le decor est original, le service était tres bon.
L' ingrédient principal soi la nourriture, n'etait Pas a la hauteur.
Exemple le burger malgré le prix élevé était tres fade, ordinaire.
Les frites d' une brasserie comme T devraient êtres délicieuses mais non. Tièdes.
Mes voisins de table ont commande le tartare de boeuf et de saumon. Bien sans plus. Les presentations des divers plats étaient tres ordinaires.
Très bon choix de vins.
C'etait Ma premiere et dernière fois."}
{"text":"Brasserie t was an experience all in its own. The small cube-like restaurant looks more like a modish boutique than a famous Normand Laprise restaurant but the chic style makes it all the more unique. This was the restaurant I so eagerly awaited; I had watched Anthony Bourdain gorge himself with Martin Picard and Norman Laprise on his show The Layover, and ever since I was hooked and ready to try. My meal was superb, the atmosphere was a bit cramped and loud but the food was excellently prepared. I had an amazing cocktail to start that was garnished with what looked to be a dried and candied flower. There was a heavy taste of ginger and cognac but the deep royal purple drink stunned me with it's lightness on the tongue.

Inevitably with a French restaurant I had to try foie gras which I so adamantly put off because of hesitance of the force feeding but their pan seared foie gras with grilled apples was nothing short of divine. The liver was so fatty there was no gritty taste of iron but instead it touched my tongue rich and melted as my taste buds practically receded in joy. Amazing first experience, I'm afraid I have spoiled myself with such an amazing foie gras. 

For the main, I settled on a St. Patrick's Day special that was seared venison with a butternut squash puree and a sweet braise topped with Guinness (to stick with the Irish holiday). The venison was a deep red, almost purple but still tender and moist. I devoured it, completely practically leaving no signs that it once was on the plate. 

Finally, I settled the night with a nice crème brûlée. To be honest, it's hard to go wrong with crème brûlée especially if you can see the crushed vanilla bean within the custard. 

Overall, I had an amazing experience. Perhaps it was the fact I was in good company, and was with people who were acquaintances of Normand Laprise but the food lived up to the standard I expected. I will not comment on price, I don't know how much the check was but I imagine it was quite expensive. So, if you're in Montreal and you feel like treating yourself to an amazing meal and aren't on a budget, Brasserie t should not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Food was very meh at best. shrimp sandwich not good, and vegetarian burger not tasty. Good service though!"}
{"text":"On our first day in Montreal we wandered by Brasserie T! and decided to give it a go. While we didn't have a reservation (it never would have occurred to me to make a reservation for Thursday lunch), we were seated promptly. The service was warm and attentive, and we were well taken care of.

The salmon tartare is fantastic, with lots of ingredients to give you that briney, salty, sweet, spicy combo that tickles my tastebuds. Hubs had the steak frites, which were also delicious. I'm still amazed that flank steak used to be such a cheap cut of meat and now is super expensive and popular. 

We started with the cheese croquettes which, while tasty, I'm not sure were worth their $7 price tag (there were only three!). 

The patio area is great for people watching, so I'd highly recommend getting your food outside if the weather agrees.

While I really enjoyed my experience there, I'm not sure I'd make it a regular habit, as lunch for two (with one drink each) cost us $80 after tip. A little bit spendy for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"The building is very cool architecturally speaking, resembling an ultra modern train car made mostly of glass.  Once inside you'll appreciate the modern décor and well designed space, with a hidden underground kitchen (not to worry, the bar is on the surface level).  

I started with a side salad that was surprising comprised of simply leafy greens and dressing.  Fortunately the dressing was quite nice but a couple tomatoes thrown in would have been nice.  For my entrée I had the Coquille St-Jacques: scallops and shrimp baked al-gratin style and served on a large scallop shell.  It was quite a clever presentation and was a rich, delicious dish.  The cocktails are handcrafted and my drink special was muddled with fresh basil leaves."}
{"text":"The only place that makes this restaurant great, is it's location. Don't get me wrong, the food is really good but it's nearly impossible to get a reservation and for the terrace, it's first come first served. It's definitely overpriced but again location location location. If you're lucky enough to get a spot outside during the festivals, then you get to eat and enjoy the show at the same time which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Right in the middle of the Plaza -that means you go get a view, from inside its basically made up of a container ban - that has a chic design inside. Space is limited inside, so you can really feel the waiters are passing either on left or right fr where you are seated.

Food is simple yet looks elegant.

Plus they speak english and are nice."}
{"text":"Hard to get a table here - we had to arrive at 5:30.  The Sangria was wonderful, the charcuterie plate was excellent.  My wife greatly enjoyed the sausage and quinoa plate - the sausage was tender and very mild, the quinoa was a bit bland.  I had the braised lamb shank which was fall-off-the-bone tender, moist and very flavorful.  We split a chocolate desert which was excellent, but took a long time to be served.

Nice view of the dancing fountain during dinner, and we even had the Canadian PM go by with his security detail while we were there!

We departed quite full and very happy.  The service was attentive without being annoying, though as mentioned above the desert was a little slow.  All the food was wonderful, though the quinoa could have used more flavor, perhaps a sauce.

Bottom line: we would definitely return."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant!
We went there before a show in the quartier des spectacles. It's very close and convenient. They serve the usual things you would expect in a brasserie. Burgers, tartare, etc. But they are well-made and tastes good. A little expensive for what it is but that would be expected in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"So we had a little time to kill after our Just for Laughs panel and we'd been talking about wanting to indulge in a charcuterie platter while in Montreal, so Brasserie T seemed like a well-situated, promising option.

Though it was too sunny to sit outside, we wound up with a very nice table inside and began perusing the restaurant's fairly extensive menu. We finally decided to order:

Charcuterie Platter (For 2): So we were first of all presented with a jar of pickles, which seemed a little weird but hey, pickles are delicious so I'm not complaining. The platter arrived shortly after and it contained some kind of sliced salami, sausage prepared on a piece of toast, two kinds of pate, sautéed onions, and bread. Everything here was very tasty, though I've gotta single out the pate. One of them was a chicken-liver pate and it was truly one of the best pates I've ever eaten. (The other pate was similarly superb.)

La fleur des monts (30G): This was a simple platter of two pieces of hard cheese, some walnuts, and a jam of some kind (currant, maybe?) The cheese was excellent and went well with the various other items on our table.

Side Salad and Gazpacho: These were both just okay. The side salad had been drizzled with a dressing that was way too subtle to make any real impact, while the gazpacho, though tasty, didn't contain the depth of flavor that I was hoping for (which ensured that the sameness of every bite got a little tiresome after a while).

Still, I'm very happy with my meal at Brasserie T. The food was mostly above average and our waiter couldn't possibly have been nicer or more helpful."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while staying at the Hyatt Regency nearby.  Nice friendly place, with a lovely little bar.  And they had a really tasty steak frites, cooked perfectly.  A little on the expensive side, but very nice."}
{"text":"Unique exterior and interior design for a restaurant, staffs are extremely nice and friendly. Love the food and that late night special they have for dinner! The onion soup and halibut was my favourite, everything else was great as well ! Will definitely come back during next visit and highly recommended place to try !"}
{"text":"Looks like a makeshift trailer in the middle of the arts center.

The sauteed liver as well as the escargot was the best evaaaar.

The bartender was cool as shit.

Its kinda pretentious....every chick in dreesses and blinged-the-F-out.

The hostesses were bisshes that day."}
{"text":"I hated the tight squeeze of this place. It's small and annoying. The width of this place is like 8 feet, and the menu is boring. I did not enjoy my experience. It's too small to accommodate groups, or even small parties of 2 people.

I would no bother considering this place."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Their snails are extremely good tasting. And their desserts are good too!"}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup l'emplacement et le concept, mais c'est vraiment cher pour ce que tu manges! Aussi, le service laissait à désirer. Sauf que tu es sur la place des festivals, donc l'endroit parfait pour avoir une vue sur les shows l'été! 

Sinon, pour une meilleure expérience, je vous suggère d'aller prendre un verre seulement, avec une douzaine d'huîtres et d'aller ailleurs par la suite!"}
{"text":"Skip the main courses and stick with the seared foie gras. We had it as an entree, raved, and then our main courses were a let down in comparison. Back to the seared foie gras for dessert! 

The service was a bit reserved. Not rude, but not warm. Still, have I mentioned the seared foie gras is worth the trip?"}
{"text":"Great place to come for good food. Stayed at the Hyatt and was lucky enough to find this place so close. The waiter was professional but not overly friendly (so French :-)!), which is fine by me. He knew his menu well and was able to accommodate my vegetarian diet. I would definitely go here again when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Surprised by some of the bad reviews of this place. We drove from Nyc and came for late lunch (1:45) place wasn't full. Server was very friendly and we ordered beef & salmon tartares (the appetizer portions were large enough to share between 2 of us). Sea snails were great. Not too overpowering and great with the bread. I love the mushroom and boiled egg (slightly salty but tasty). Nice and relaxing with everyone speaking French around us. Definitely recommend and we love to come back in the summer when there's seat on the terrace."}
{"text":"Lorsque j'ai un spectacle à la Place-des-arts, je vais souvent à la Brasserie T. De l'extérieur, il faut vraiment avouer que l'endroit est magnifique. 
Points positifs : 
- la qualité des produits est impressionnante 
- la nourriture est très bonne, du tartare de saumon aux côtes levées (dont la sauce est légèrement tomatée) 
- la liste des vins est très unique, étant composée entièrement d'importations privées 
- les serveurs sont gentils, il y a beaucoup de personnel pour répondre à nos besoins 

Points négatifs :

{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight with friends. One of my friends was a smart cookie and called ahead to make a reservation for 10PM but as it turns out, we showed up earlier and got in at around half past eight! We skipped the long line and were seated quickly. I can say that we would have not gotten in without that reservation..kudos to my friend. 

The place is expensive but we were all ready to splurge. Myself and a friend had the sea snails in garlic as an appetizer. They were scrumptious as I always find snails to be. I never have French food without them! As my entree, I had the buttered steak with frites (fries). It was tender and juicy and I could have eaten more of it! The fries were crispy and tasty as well. Service was very attentive and pleasant even though our French was not good! Dessert was a peach sorbet for me and it tasted a little bit like peach tea ice cream..not what I was expecting but still good, I suppose. The place is pricey but I would recommend it and come back! Sitting outside in the summer is also very nice!"}
{"text":"In all my time traveling and eating, I've never been turned away. Adorable family of three arrives and most spots roll out the hospitality. So we've been fortunate: that's always been our experience. Up till now. That was not the case for this tiny cafe adjacent to the Contemporary Art Museum in Montreal.

With seats available, we were turned away at a non-meal hour 3:30 pm with multiple tables available when we mentioned that we wanted tea and wine on the patio, but hadn't decided on food yet. It was an arbitrary, abrupt feeling, even mean spirited experience. The hostess looked us up and down and said, \"non!\"  And of coarse we complied because who wants to eat anywhere that treats customers in this fashion?! Nope!

I was listening to a favorite podcast, \"Splendid Table\" about the difference between service and hospitality. It's a case of making a customer feel remarkably welcome. Here we felt completely the opposite."}
{"text":"Brasserie K. What to say? Let's start with it would have been acceptable at less than 2 thirds the price, maybe half. So you can tell where this is going.

Let's start with the Chef: Charles-Antoine Crête. He represents pretty much all my pet-peeves about my Québecois culture. He's unable to master the language and talks like what as a kid we called \"Farmers\" (Turned out we were wrong as most are better educated than the urban folks) by using the basest Joual vulgarities. There's a difference between the word FOOD and the word MEAL, but this is lost on him. Plus his table etiquette is ridiculously missing from a man who everyone seems to consider a great chef. There's a way to holding a spoon my friends. Then there's his condescending behaviour with even his family and friends when he's on TV shows such as l'Épicerie on Radio-Canada.

The Restaurant: Hip and modern in tight quarters but it works. However when I'm paying over 100$ for an average meal I could easily dish out in my tinny apartment kitchen, I expect to sit on more than 10$ patio chairs from Réno-Dépot. 

The Service: The service was fantastic, can't complain. Our waitress, very beautiful and shapely (but that's just me) could have forgone her fake French accent and since we weren't from the \"In Crowd\" we did get treated to some look-downs.

But I can look over a vulgar chef, stupid patio chairs and snobby service... if the food was mind-blowing, but it ain't, let's get this straight, we are talking very ordinary pub grub here. I love gastro-pub, just not this one.

First off I really wanted those parmesan fondues. This was a flashback to the glorious 80s... I was hoping from something tweaked or upgraded, but no, just ordinary parmesan fondues, basically fresh made cheese sticks you can get at any restaurant these days. Although, the tomato sauce accompaniment was really good.

This was followed by the only awesome part of the meal, the Foie Gras plate. This way to pricy portion of Foie Gras was delicious but let's faces it. Foie Gras is hard to fuck up. Salt, pan sear it and just don't overcook it, that's it. So it hardly requires much know-how.

As the main I ordered the bavette, a gastro-pub staple if you will. This was the weirdest looking bavette I've ever had and tasted like regular sirloin, not the hardier piece of meat it's supposed to be. The pat of homemade butter was horrible and the fries - while really amazing - filled up three quarters of my plate. Fries cost NOTHING to produce; I'm confused as to the price of my plate for this very reason.

The desert, a profiterole another throwback to the 80s was indeed very delicious, worth it and saved this experience from total damnation. 

All in all, the food wasn't horrible; it was good, but seriously overpriced for what I received while sitting on PVC patio furniture. Pricey enough for me to not return. For the same price and for gastro-pub that is supremely better, just head on over to Taverne Square Dominion on Metcalf. They also have one of the best, if not the best bar in town."}
{"text":"Lovely place lovely placed :) I've heard about it on tv and I was kind of skeptical about the place at first. They simply owned me!! lol the food is simply amazing. I took the Montreal Sausage and couldn't stop eating it! It's one of those place where I could take anything on the menu blindly and I would like it."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very helpful with suggestions and service was fast. Try the seared foie gras. It was the best thing we had that night. The salmon tartar was also very good."}
{"text":"Found this by chance the first time I was in Montreal.  Great wines and very good food. Tiny space. But they do an amazing job. Great charcuterie."}
{"text":"Beef tartare with fries and asparagus salad special were amazing. The perfect cartoonish pickled mushroom in the salad was the highlight, and of course the Quebec asparagus. Crostini served with tartare were delicious. We sat at the bar, friendly bartender served us, made the tartare spicy after confirming our preference. Sweet clover creamer brûlée was meh, crust way too sweet. Dessert menu can use some improvement. Crowd starts rolling in after 9, as their special deal menu starts."}
{"text":"L'expérience date mais aux dire de certains, elle fut sensiblement semblable.

Une bouffe bonne mais sans plus. La qualité était impeccable mais il y avait un petit quelque chose de spécial qui me manquait dans mon assiette de bavette.

Le service était très bien par contre !

Pour le prix...j'irai ailleurs."}
{"text":"I have been past this place before on previous visits to Montreal I had no idea that this was a full restaurant until it was recommended by a friend.  Wanting a decent meal for my last supper in la belle province, we made reservations for two.  Although the restaurant looks tiny from the outside, while seated it didn't feel claustrophobic.  I scanned the wine menu and decided on a decent Italian red at $45 which I felt was reasonable.

We decided to skip right to the mains.  This turned out to be a bit of a mistake.  Although the wine came very quickly, it seemed to take an eternity to place our food orders.  When the server finally came by, my mom had to request some bread to balance out the wine. For the record, the other servers seemed to be incredibly attentive; I just think we didn't luck out because ours, although very polite, was elusive.

I had the flank steak served with frites.  It was pretty good though I have had better.  I did not like the flavour of the herb butter that was on top of it.  My mom had the salmon and fennel salad which I sampled and thought was very well prepared.  The salmon was so barely cooked that it could have been sashimi!  Tasty!

Overall, it was a pleasant meal but I was not particularly wowed."}
{"text":"Being on a budget Normand Laprise's flagship Toque is way outside my price range so I was excited when he opened up a more affordable restaurant.  Located in the Quartier des Spectacles this chic restaurant is an ideal place to visit if you're catching a show at Place des Arts.  It is small so a reservation is a good idea and an absolute must if something is going on at Place des Arts.

They have a small menu but they focus on doing things well.  I ordered the shrimp guedille which is sort of like a lobster roll but with shrimp instead.  I enjoyed it quite a bit and thought that the bun they used was pretty high quality.  The fries were crispy, thick and overall really good.

I would say the service was kind of lacking.  It was difficult at times to get the waitress' attention and when we did she seemed kind of indifferent.  I'd still come back here though especially if I was in the Quartier des Spectacles."}
{"text":"I live in New York and was visiting Montreal last week and read a lot of reviews to try out this place on trip advisor and to say I was pleased is definitely an understatement. This place is amazing from its location near the Place des Arts and being on St. Catherine. We ordered the egg and mushroom dish for an appetizer which was delicious it was kind of like a poached egg on top of potatoes and mushrooms. Then for entrees we ordered a lobster roll and steak with fries. Everything was so fresh and the steak was just the right type of juicy. They also have great beers on draft and I got a mojito which was just the right touch as well. Was very pleased and hope to be back here when I am in Montreal again !"}
{"text":"I was so excited about going to this restaurant: that ultra fancy glassed-in place next to the Place des Arts that passersbies gawk at on the way to the metro station. The restaurant was one of several that participated in the 'Taste MTL' event was organized by Tourisme Montreal. The four of us went there on a Friday night and thanks to our reserveration, we were seated right away - the place was already quite busy despite it being still early for dinner, around 5.30ish. 

Since it was part of the said 'Taste MTL' event, instead of ordering from the à la carte menu, we had two options for each of the three courses on offer. For the entrée, I had a plate of salad with sea snails. I thought to myself, \"Let's try to get out of my comfort zone a bit tonight.\" Not that I had any other choice, really, since the other entrée was beef tartare with fries, and uncooked meat gives me nightmares. I made an excellent choice. Those little pudgy sea snails were so delicious I think I could easily eat a plate of them as my main, and perhaps dessert. Yes, they were quite wonderful. In fact, if they could sing, they would win the Grammy.  

I had veal medallions as the main course. They were good - really tasty and tender - but it's not something I would pick again next time. Here's the thing, the veal came on a bed of sauerkraut and the waitress didn't tell us that. She explained that the veal came with cabbage, which was factual, but wasn't 100% accurate. I should've asked her to explain the menu in French, the language she was clearly more comfortable in. It's okay though, two of my friends took over those tangy shreddies and thought they were really good. 

Dessert was Paris brest, which came in a generous portion and was meticulously presented. I don't think it was super special taste wise, but perhaps because it's not my favorite dessert to begin with (I prefer crème brûlée), so I have no legitimate complaints. 

But like they say, a restaurant needs to be able to offer more than just good food, and Brasserie T clearly understands that. The decor and ambiance made me wish I had a cottage just like that by the lake. It is sleek and classy inside, just the way it looks like from the outside, and that classiness does not translate into snob, despite our group being dressed rather casually. The staff were friendly, courteous and respectful. I was also impressed at how attentive and quick they were, without being invasive. In short, I would give them a champagne bucket of stars for service.

We left the place full and happy, which is all one can ask from a restaurant, don't you agree?"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious yet simple food coupled with exceptional service.

The bavette is exquisite, so are the accompanying frites...

The tarte aux bleuts while delicious, is tiny and not worth $ 8.00

Espresso, also delicious but I'll admit I hate to be set back $ 4 for a tiny cup of espresso even though it is Nespresso (you can almost buy a sleeve of ten capsules for that price).

A word of warning though...on these beautiful Montreal summer nights, you are much better off sitting on their terrace than inside...it gets incredibly loud in that tiny space of theirs and you might not even be able to hear your date no matter if you have bionic hearing or how clean your ears are...the loudness of the dining room is the only fault I find in Brasserie T!"}
{"text":"We made a point of making a reservation in hopes of getting a table on the terrasse which we were promised on arrival but the manager decided to keep us at the bar and let walk in couples take the spots outside. Disappointing treatment, ruined our experience. Our server was excellent but the management had poor communication skills. The staff was appropriately apologetic."}
{"text":"Went here on the suggestion of my cousin that lives in Montreal.  Was unable to get a reservation online, but was able to secure a spot at the bar by stopping in at lunchtime to ask if there were any openings that evening.  Tip: there were many open tables in the restaurant that evening.  Don't rely on the Open Table saying that they're booked as I believe many people had multiple reservations and then make a game time decision.  I had seen the Anthony Bourdin clip where he tried the mushrooms with soft boiled egg, so I knew that I wanted to start my meal with this.  It was divine.  For my main course I chose to get the salmon tartare.  It was wonderful.  I opted for the salad instead of the fries, but wish that I hadn't.  The mixed greens were in very large pieces that made it difficult to eat with any sort of grace.  The dressing was also a bit bland given the bitter taste of the greens.  The fries that I spied on another diner's plate looked delicious.  My husband was less happy with his salmon that had been steamed and is served at room temperature, but the fennel that was served with it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Cute lil restaurant on the plaza des arts. Lots of windows so you feel like you're sitting on a patio, except it's warm. We waited about 30 min for a table for 2 what we thought was the end of the lunch hour rush around 1:15, and indeed it was because after we were seated, there was no more line. 

The food was worth the wait. My vegetarian partner got the mushrooms-cheese-eggs appetizer so the perfect amount of food for lunch and more mushrooms than cheese so not too heavy. I had the duck roulletes with a side salad. It was like a light pate, so good with the crusty bread. The salad was a bowl of fresh greens with an oil and vinegar dressing. We finished with a slice of their carrot cake which was perfectly moist, not too sweet, and drizzled with honey. 

The decor is modern. Lots of floor to ceiling windows making for great people-watching along Rue Jean-Marques. There are benches across the street so we observed a couple making out while a stranger openly stared in disapproval. Clientele at lunch mostly business people. Service was good. Bathrooms very clean with 2 private stalls in the rear of the building and then a sink out in the open. Accepts credit cards. Lunch reservations recommended!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to be impressed by Brasserie T. After all, it is the offspring of the world famous Toqué.

It's not that the food was bad, it was ok (although slightly uneven). But for this price level, and since its related to Toqué, I was expecting more, to be wowed, and not have the impression to be in any other generic French bistro.

We started with a cocktail. My girlfriend had the cocktail of the day. Original and inspired, it was delicious. I took the Bloody Caesar, thinking I would get something funky or reinvented, but it was unfortunately one of the most boring and bland bloody I've had in a long time.

For the main course, I took the beef tartare, seduced by the promise of smoked sriracha. I like my tartare spicy, so it sounded like the perfect match. Unfortunately, the tartare I got was quite bland. If there was sriracha in it, it must have been less than a quarter of a teaspoon because there was no hint of hot peppers in it. For the same price, I much prefer the classic beef tartare at Holder. The fries were good, served with a generous portion of homemade mayo.

My girlfriend seemed to be luckier. She took the salad of the day made with salmon confit. It was fresh and tasy.

We didn't want to drink too much as we were attending a show afterwards, so we looked at the options for wine by the glass. The cheapest option for a glass of red was the house wine at $12 a glass. Something is wrong when the cheapest glass of wine is more expensive than the cocktails offered on the menu. A cheaper option would be quite welcome.

Finally, I ordered the sugar pie. Again disappointed. The portion was about 4 bites. It was very good, but Brasserie T being a bistro, I would have expected a larger portion.

So overall, the food was ok, the service was great. But at $148 including tip for a quick meal for two before a show which was quite unimpressive... it's not what I was expecting from them. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We were driving through Montreal and made a short stop here on way to airport. Nice location, near the modern art museum, neat little set up.  They have outdoor seating and the rest of the restaurant is in glass.

We had the snails, which were delicious, great pesto type sauce. I also had the coquille st jacques, which was pretty good, but didn't blow me away. Similar to a style you might find in a japanese restaurant - mayo based sauce with mushrooms and shrimp. Enjoyed the butter for the bread. Kids had the poached eggs with mushrooms which they seemed to enjoy. 

All in all, a good stop.

Service was pretty good. Told them we had a plane to catch and they were decently quick."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint.  Good service.  Seated quickly.  Excellent selections of French wines, even some by the glass and the carafe.  First course--terrine de fois gras was delicious.  Texture of baguette was not as crisp in the crust as we like, but the flavor was outstanding.  Saucisse de Montreal was flavorful, and had a natural taste.  Coquille St. Jacques was rich and delicous.  Paris Brest for dessert was perfect--excellent pate a choux, and wonderful filling.  Overall, a very good experience.  Noisy, and a bit crowded, so make sure that the \"sardines in a can\" feeling doesn't bother you before you make your reservation."}
{"text":"Chef Nomand Laprise's take on typical brasserie fares comes with high expectations but fails to live up to its executive chef's level of excellence. Not that I had a terrible experience but I just feel like there are dozens of better brasseries in Montreal, notably in the plateau.

Its location in the Quartier des Spectacles is perfect for people watching on a hot sunny day. I had the meal of the day: sauteed sweetbread accompanied with a asparagus and herb salad. Delicious and well executed except that it was the size of a large entree. My girlfriend had the beef tartare with fries. The beef was not the best I've ever had. Its color was a pale red and its taste was covered with a lot of spices. The fries were however delicious, more on the crunchy side. We had the profiterole and the pannacotta, both satisfying but not memorable.

In all, I am somewhat happy with my meal but would not go back. I'll leave this brasserie to the tourists and head to my favorite haunt on St-Denis! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour un plan rapide sans fla-flas, de bonne qualité, plutôt agréable et sympatique. Menu typique brasserie française (doh!), les tartares avaient l'air attrayants. Ma bavette était bonne, les frites aussi, mayo maison rien à redire en fait. Service impec.

La liste des vins est courte et manque de choix au verre, mais comme les prix sont plus que raisonnables, cela compense. Et la qualité est indéniable.

Seul bémol, ça reste cher pour ce qu'on a, c'est pas déraisonnable mais 20$ pour la bavette c'est pas très généreux. Mais on paie la prime Toqué! j'imagine, et pour l'emplacement. C'est un tout petit bémol."}
{"text":"Nice spot an patio. The lunch salmon with fill is very different and very good. The \"house\" chard is lacking a bit with a very short finish but otherwise a good spot. Glad I stopped."}
{"text":"One of the most interesting restaurants that you will visit.  It is an all glass enclosed structure on the side of the Place des arts in downtown Montreal.  You get the sense you are walking to a fancy metro stop and then all of the sudden realize your in an ultra chic resto.  

Despite the modern digs, its very comfortable and the waitstaff is actually dressed pretty casual.  The  fries are some of the best I  have had in a while.  Go with the tartare and you will not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"The Gaspacho was so refreshing made the rest of the lunch worth while. Great for a summer lunch."}
