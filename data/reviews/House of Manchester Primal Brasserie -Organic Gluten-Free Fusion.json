{"text":"Great little place in North Las Vegas. Small but tastefully appointed interior makes for a very comfortable dining experience as does the personable owner and staff. I had lunch of jerk chicken, carrots & cabbage and baked macaroni & cheese. All three items were quite tasty, the chicken spicy but not overpoweringly so. Both sides were quite good as well, especially the mac & cheese which I'm not normally a big fan of but I loved this rendition, especially after a few hits of Marie Sharp's Hot Sauce straight from Belize for some extra kick. For me it's a long way from home but I hope to stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood as there are several other dishes on the menu calling out to me."}
{"text":"We came to Vegas in our RV and ended up staying a few days because of an engine problem. After picking up parts at the Cummins dealership I did a search for organic restaurants and found this place not far out of our way. It's in an industrial area and not that easy to spot...drove by the first time and had to turn around. Once inside this cozy little place we were pleasantly surprised! We have a lot of dietary preferences and rarely eat in restaurants.  We are also totally unfamiliar with Caribbean food! The owner was happy to answer all our questions as we deliberated over the menu options. The food was delicious with an interesting combination of seasonings. We especially enjoyed the cheesecake dessert!  Next time we pass through Vegas we will definitely stop in again....highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant will inspire you. The service is exceptional and the food is delicious. I was very pleasantly surprised and felt like I needed to write a review to let everyone know how good this place is."}
{"text":"If you know Vegas like I do, it's already hard enough to find Jamaican food, especially a good Jamaican food spot. From the moment, I walked in the door, I was greeted with superb customer service, so my thoughts were, I hope the food is as good as the customer service. We'll, I must say, that this place didn't disappoint me. I had the jerk chicken platter and was impressed and then I decided to try the jerk wings and my absolute favorite were the jerk wings hands down. If you've had a hard time looking for good Jamaican food, look no further. This place tops them all."}
{"text":"I was really craving Jamaican food so I stopped by this place. I couldn't wait to get home to eat it. I ordered the oxtail with rice and peas, two patties and a side of macaroni and cheese. Boy was I bummed out.... The rice an peas tasted very earthy,the oxtail wasn't to bad it just had a lot of fat on it. I thought it would of came with a side of cabbage( with the amount of money I spent), so wrong........The Mac an cheese was good. Now when I took a first glance at the patties,I was very skeptical because at first glance,having to eat a real Jamaican pattie it looks sooooo different. I decided to be more open-minded? and went for it anyway. It was salty, dry,I couldn't even swallow it............ That was my breaking point. I tried....I really did."}
{"text":"Two months ago, a coworker said a new Jamaican restaurant opened down the road, and I have been a happy regular there ever since. The chef Mickel and waitress Grace are truly passionate about their craft and deliver an elegant, cozy dining experience in the middle of an industrial area. Well worth the drive. Their jerked smoked ribs, brisket, and chicken wings are now weekly staples of my diet because the meat is moist and tender with a slightly blackened crunchy layer of yumminess on the outside and a unique, flavorful herbal spiciness that is not spicy hot. I no longer get my ribs, brisket, or wings from the big chain BBQ and wing places further up Losee Road. To  add some heat to any of their dishes, they offer six types of Caribbean bottled sauces, of which my favorites are the \"Exotic Sauce\"(mild, green mango) and the orange habenaro sauce. For a quick lunch, I like the meat patties, but their specialty braised oxtail is my favorite. The oxtail is melt-in-your-mouth tender but be aware it is spicy hot and has a wonderfully distinct flavor different from the soul food and Hawaiian styles of oxtail I have had at other Vegas restaurants. For those who do not like hot food, try any of the curry chicken or Bammy Chicken dishes. On the sweeter side, try the homemade scones, cheesecake, or milkshakes. Important note: if you plan to dine in, please call Grace to make a reservation, as seating is limited."}
{"text":"I tried them out yesterday and I was a little disappointed. Their portions are small and there was no jerk sauce. The chicken was cooked and seasoned well just wasn't the jerk I'm used to and was looking for."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good quality, organic food that is not only healthy but also really tasty, this would be a great place for you! Friends of ours suggested it, otherwise we may have never found it. I've probably driven by it 50 times and never noticed it before. The seating area is small and since the food is freshly made to order, it takes a little longer than other places, but so worth it! The staff was incredibly friendly. The chef came out to speak with us. The Kasaba (yuca) bread and pizza was amazing! I even bought some to go. So delicious!"}
{"text":"An absolute GEM!!! Driving thru from Venice Beach to Grand Canyon and did a search for \"organic restaurant\" in Vegas. Can't believe we lucked out to find this place. They were close to ending the night when we walked in and were welcomed with open arms. Ordered the Acky Patties twice in one night and had amazing conversation with owners. Conscious Cooking at its heart and soul. Can't wait to have a reason to drive thru again to say hi again and enjoy their AMAZING food. Thanks again"}
{"text":"Once you enter through the beautiful red door, you step into a cool oasis of personal service, food made to order, 100% organic ingredients and the knowledge that you have found that special \"hole in the wall\" jerk chicken restaurant that you won't soon forget! Oh yeah, the food? The three course meal was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. We didn't want to stop around the strip and deal with the hustle and bustle. We picked this spot on the way out of Vegas. Boy were we glad we did. Grace was delightful and extreme helpful when it came to figuring out what to get. Mickael was really friendly and was very welcoming once we had a chat. The food was out of this world, spicy and filling. Definetly recommend visiting this place!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. What do you call a Mom and Pop place that is run by a younger couple? The Owner/chef takes an immense amount of pride in his prep and cooking. Very good over all experience. Don't let the location scare you off. This is a must try place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok...ok...I was feeling for some Jamaican food and I didn't want to go to Tasty Island so I Google this and questioned the lady on the phone because I've been hurt b4 when it comes to the food. So ummm, once here I was wowed at the cleanines. The lady I forget her name was nice and still wet behind the ears because they're only one month old. Anyhoo...I wanted the red Snapper but they sold the last one so I got the oxtails instead. B4 I talk about the oxtails let me just say that the beef patties were on freaking point. Ok...ok...back to the oxtails, FREAKING AWESOME SHUN! And the cook was cool too. Definitely coming back and hope plenty of other folks give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow- needed food to go close to the highway when heading north to St George and my favorite off-highway poke place was closed. Yelped \"organic food\" and found this little slice of heaven.   Everything was made from scratch with the care and attention you often get at a new business.   The jerk chicken was crispy and had amazing flavor.   The vegan hand pies were unique and unforgettable.   Plantains coulda been riper but we're perfectly fried in light flavored oil.   Service was delightful.   Support this great little up and coming gem! A new go-to for me when heading out of Vegas and needing a snack in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Off the beaten path in the north end of town, but worth your time to drive up there or even catch a Uber. Trust me, you will be glad you made the trip. This ain't no usual Jamaican joint with a grumpy server dishing up from a hot pan in front of you, it's a sit down place and you will have to wait. I had the vegetable dish over rice and peas with plantains and it's the best meal I've had in a long time. This place will be #1 on my to do list when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I learned that there is a new Caribbean restaurant just minutes from the office, so we carpooled over to check it out. Great decision!  Our server, Grace, was fantastic. Super friendly and sweet. Among our group, we tried several items, including curry chicken, braised oxtail, and beef patty pastries. I had the curry goat, which had just the right amount of heat. All of our entrees were served over rice and peas, and several of us also ordered side dishes, including me. I had the fried plantains, which were great; and the carrots and cabbage, which was too bland for my taste (although there are plenty of sauces available to heat things up).  Service was slow, because everything is cooked to order. And this restaurant is really small, so you might have to wait for a table if you don't call ahead. But if you have time for a lengthy lunch (of if you go for dinner or on the weekend), House of Manchester is a delicious taste of Jamaica hidden away in the middle of industrial North Las Vegas. (p.s. They also offer smoothies, if you're so inclined.)"}
{"text":"Vegan Caribbean Style! We found this whole in the wall Caribbean spot with vegan options! Organic and made with flavor & love! Recently open and a must try if you're in Vegas! Small beautiful and family oriented!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new place despite the 1 bad review. I work in the F&B industry personaly & know how some people can get if things arent made perfectly, & to their standard! As soon as my husband & I came in we were personally welcomed by the owner & made to feel right at home. The staff was so very nice & attentive, consistently checking with us to make sure everything was right. I ordered the jerk chicken with rice & my husband the jerk ribs with rice, we were very pleased with the food, service & atmoshere! This little place will surely go far. Let the food do the talking! Wishing this new gem much love & success!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and gluten free!  We were looking for a nice dinner before heading out of town and came upon House of Manchester. What a find! Caribbean themed food that is gluten free, made with natural and organic ingredients all from scratch. They even make their own cassava flour to make the different varieties of bammy bread.  We ordered the smoked spiced wings, a full rack of pimento ribs, with organic braised kale and rice and beans for the sides. The wings were the best we've ever had, rubbed in traditional seasoning and smoked--not your typical greasy wings here. When the ribs arrived they initially looked dry as we normally have sloppy sauce covered ribs. They were so moist and full of flavor. Again, the best we've ever had. Sauce would ruin them. Even the rice and beans were not your typical rice and beans. In fact, although we were served a generous portion we ordered an additional side because we couldn't get enough of all the amazing flavors going on. We tried the spinach and feta bammy bread which was moist with a perfect blend of light flavors. The restaurant is located off the strip in an industrial area that would make you want to drive by and not stop. Don't make that mistake. Once you walk inside you are transported to another world from the street you arrived at. The décor is beautiful, with soft yellow paint and wood and very comfortable chairs. The restaurant (as well as the restroom) are spotless and very relaxing.  Our server really made the meal an exceptional dining experience. No rushing just lots of kindness, smiles, and patience explaining the dishes and our options. We met the cook as well who was just as charming. The pride they have in the quality of food they prepare, the attention to detail on presentation of your meal, and the ambience of the restaurant really shows. We would not return to Las Vegas without returning to this quality restaurant and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My new favorite! Its very obvious these guys are putting a lot of love, care, and consideration into their food and ingredient choices. I venture to say it is one of the few authentically healthy and wholesome places in Vegas. And they deliver! YAY!"}
{"text":"They place has been on my bucket list for weeks!   Came to visit my neighbors today at House of Manchester! This is a hidden gem! Very nice atmosphere and casual setting. Called them to order my food for pick up and was greeted by a very sweet girl and even sweeter in person! Waiting time was just right. The food was like no other! Had the Goat curry served with rice and a side of fried plantain. They even gave me a free sample! Delicious! All in all a great new place. I will be back soon! #win"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. This is one of the only places in town to get jerk chicken! Everything on the menu is made with fresh ingredients.  So far, I've tried the jerk ribs, jerk chicken, jerk wings, carrots & cabbage, and macaroni and cheese. Everything is consistently delicious across the board."}
{"text":"The best grill in town hands down meat falling off the bone\"OFF-THE-BONE\" like Im back in Memphis everytime!"}
{"text":"Went in today on a whim as my husband owns a company a few doors down. I must say, I am IMPRESSED! I only ordered the jerk chicken because I was already cooking at home and OMG...it is (was cause I ate it all), AMAZING! Finally I've found an AUTHENTIC Jamaican cuisine spot and I will be going back. (This location has had several food establishments come and go, I hope this one stays!) Great customer service and awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden jewel.... While visiting Vegas i had a strong taste for a Caribbean food. I yelped Caribbean food restaurants and this place appeared highly recommended. So, I decided why not. The Uber driver was a bit skeptical about location and when arriving I too was a like yeah, I don't thinks it right... BUT wow... it truly is a hidden jewel. While the outside may come off as a bit hard and uninviting, inside the restaurant was immaculate. Very warm with a touch of elegance. It was very balanced. I could either show up in business casual attire or jeans and sneakers. Either way I'd be comfortable. The staff was very friendly. They took the time to explain all the details of the items I found on the menu to be interesting. And even took the time to explain their specialty dish, Jerk. I'm not a fan of anything jerk because a lot of places I find State-side do not prepare jerk the right way. So I simply stay away from it. None the less I was convince to give it a try.... and wow!!! Finally, a restaurant outside the Caribbean that knows how to properly prepare Jerk..... Absolutely amazing.... The cabbage and plantain was awesome!! The rice was good. The Jerk, out of this world!!! Great food excellent service equates to 5 stars....   Pricing wasn't bad at all.... I would say look to spend about twenty five dollars and with that you'll definitely take some food home, because the portions are very generous.   The only regret I have is not taking an extra plate to go.   What could use improvement: Nothing. Even outside the restaurant gives the place character. It's definitely a hidden jewel."}
{"text":"We just finished eating here and could not be happier. The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly. The place is very friendly and quaint. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I ordered the curry chicken, rice and beans and some fried plantain. I'm 100% belizean so I'm very picky when it comes to the perfection of a Caribbean dish. I moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles so Vegas is very scarce when it comes to Caribbean restaurants, I tried this place today and I was pretty pleased especially because they sell Marie sharps by the bottle  my dish was pretty good except I was kind of disappointed at the portions of my to-go order, and next time I'm going to ask for less salt cooked into my food. But all in all this place is pretty great, and definitely worth the trip  I'll be coming back to try to oxtails and their jerk chicken."}
{"text":"I had a great experience while visiting Las Vegas and this restaurant was a plus!   First, the restaurant is beautiful and elegant and isn't a hole in the wall. Secondly, the host and chef was personable and made me and my boyfriend feel special.  Finally, The Food!!! Very good oxtails they are the best that I've tasted_ very authentic.  The whole entire experience was awesome!!!   Thank you!  Rhonda (San Diego)"}
{"text":"We ordered some takeout from this location and it was just ok.  It took a really long time and there was really no one inside. I'm glad that I didn't order through Postmates and have to pay an extra fee for this food. I will say that I appreciate the fact that it's organic and vegan."}
{"text":"The customer service was excellent and I'm not writing a bad review I have never ate Caribbean or organic so the taste was different for me but was probably what it was suppose to be, lastly my kids struggled to eat it so maybe not the best choice for picky children, but regarding atmosphere and customer service they get 5 stars"}
{"text":"Brand new establishment, only about three weeks open. Very friendly staff and DELICIOUS smoked pork ribs. Parking can be a challenge, but I was told to park in the lot next to the building, which is tucked away."}
{"text":"It feels like Vegas has a billion restaurants with more opening every day. We have every ethnic cuisine you can think of from Malaysian to Guamanian. Yet we don't have many options when it comes to Caribbean and Jamaican food, and the others in town aren't very good. House of Manchester's food is very much a welcome addition to the Vegas food scene!   Location is in an industrial area but the inside is nicely appointed with a handful of tables and bar seating. Menu has all the go-to favorites including jerk chicken, oxtails, and goat curry, along with some fusion dishes and baked goods. I stuck with the jerk chicken entree for my initial visit and was pleased to receive a multi-course meal culminating with a giant, fragrant plate of perfectly-roasted, juicy chicken atop a bed of rice and peas. Comfort food, island style. I am planning a group dinner to be able to try all of their dishes soon!  Grace, my server, was super sweet. The chef came out to check on me midway through my meal. I am hoping their great food and word of mouth will be enough for them to be successful and stay open. Short of moving to a better location, I do recommend they change their hours to be open Saturdays and use social media for publicity. If you're even remotely curious about Caribbean cuisine, or want to go on a tropical vacation via your tastebuds, head on over to House of Manchester!"}
{"text":"Legit! Highly recommend! Spiced chicken was amazing. Small and cosy. Easy to drive by and miss it. Got to try out my parallel parking skills"}
{"text":"I had a great experience today at House of Manchester for lunch!  Although I had an awesome conversation with the owner, I want to give an honest review so that you can decide for yourself on whether or not to patronize this business.  I give it five stars because my overall experience was phenomenal.   Grace, the server, possibly provided the best service that I have seen in this city. At the very least, it was as good as the best service I've seen. And given that it is a small restaurant in an unsuspecting location in North Las Vegas like this, the service FAR exceeded my expectations.   When I drove down Losee road, I actually drove past it. The outside markings could use an upgrade because if I were driving down Losee and wanted a bite to eat I would never even know it was there had I not found it on Yelp.   I will say that it was warm inside. For the first 10 or 15 minutes I actually had some sweat beads on my forehead.   I started off with a cabbage and carrot salad, steamed. It was very good and very well seasoned.  Next came the plantains. They were very tasty and very plump but if you are used to American style plantains you may find them to be less sweet than usual. When plantains are served around here especially, they are dessert sweet.   For the entrée, I got the jerk chicken. I found the portion to be on the small side. The flavor was incredible. Just what I expect from a Jamaican restaurant and the flavor that has been very difficult for me to find anywhere outside of either the Caribbean or Florida. The chicken was smoked and the flavor was all the way to the bone. I can't wait to go back and get more of it. I will caveat the portion size comment with the fact that I have what most would call a ridiculously large appetite.    I also tried something called a Bammy. I tried both a steamed one and a fried one. Definitely get it fried. Extremely tasty! It's like a fried piece of bread that doesn't use traditional wheat flour.   I was just about to get my check when they asked me if I would be interested in dessert. I had not even considered getting it until they asked and I am so glad that they did. I am a huge dessert person and this was in the top three best desserts that I've had in Las Vegas. I went with the vanilla rum cake. It came with a scoop of ice cream and homemade whipped cream. It was seriously to die for.   I got to talk with the chef a little bit after I finished eating but I assure you that the great conversation we had did not influence my review. The food was truly exceptional.  I highly recommend you give it a try. I certainly will be back!"}
{"text":"First off, this is a gem hidden in the middle of nowhere.  But right when you enter,  it's a small restaurant with a very intimate feeling. The staff (Grace and Mickel)  were so welcoming.  The best customer service we've pever had.  We had the bammy appetizer, which was so flavorful and simple. My girl had the snapper, while I had the goat.  I have never had goat before but I will say, it was so good with the rice. Cooked to perfection.  The snapper was subtle but delicious. Finally we had the rum cake (which is to die for). The cheese cake with the berry mix was fantastic. This truly is a place that should get more attention. Give those two a raise. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I came here last Thursday for lunch after searching for \"healthy food\" in North Las Vegas, which is like searching for a needle in a hay stack. I was surprised when this place popped up, so I had to give it a try.   It took me aback when I walked in due to its elegant style, which turned out to mirror the food and service. Not only was the jerk chicken full of flavor and cooked to perfection, the chef and the server were very hospitable and accommodating.   Food and health is a passion of mine and it was clear the chef shares a similar outlook. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good food in a personalized setting."}
{"text":"The food and ambience was amazing. It took a little long to receive the food but well worth it. We learned that this is one of the few places in the country that makes their own fresh cassava bread of multiple flavors. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you. This place has a very nice interior and equally nice server. I ordered the oxtails which were extremely flavorful. Lots of different layers. It could have been cooked just a touch more but that's just me nitpicking. It didn't stop me from eating the whole thing licking my fingers clean. I was a little disappointed they didn't have any beef patties. All and all I would go again."}
{"text":"Thanks to a fellow Yelper's recommendation, I took a chance on a different Jamaican-Caribbean restaurant, and thank goodness his taste for good food is similar to mine! ;)  These oxtails really do melt in your mouth, and the jerk chicken was indeed moist on the inside with a lightly crisped skin on the outside. Just right level of saltiness and spices too! Grace was also very nice and helpful, and my order was ready in a fairly quick 10-15 minutes. Parking is limited along the curb near the restaurant, but there is a large customer parking lot less than a block down. Their food is worth a little bit of a walk (5 minutes or less) so folks, just walk there if need be! Next try for me will be either the goat curry or smoked snapper!  :D"}
{"text":"Small but robust classiness with a delicious meal and friendly service. It's out of the way and off strip. It's organic food."}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical about eating here since my family is from Jamaica and my mom and dad own their own store in Connecticut. So, I already have my own opinion on what I think real GOOD Jamaican food should taste like. This place honestly had some of the BEST Jamaican food I've had since I left the East Coast. I had the oxtail and it was DELICIOUS! It was seasoned well, and the texture was amazing. It had so much meat on it and not as much fat as some of the oxtail I usually eat. Everything was so tasty and I was surprised on how much flavor all our food came with. My husband who is a born and raised Jamaica also enjoyed his smoked pimento chicken which is similar to the jerk chicken.   I would have taken pictures, but we ate the food so quickly because it was so delicious! Needless to say, we will definitely be back to taste more items on their menu. Additionally, the service was spectacular! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was expecting way less than what I was served with. The flavors are amazing and the ambiance is so romantic and private. It is truly something hidden that must be brought to light. If you are in the area give it try, you will be impressed."}
{"text":"I hate I saw the waitress take my chicken curry out of what looked like a storage cooler portioned inside of a sandwich bag. Not sure if she just reheated or not but the \"stewed curry chicken\" was just ok. Their were no potatoes or anything else that came with it. It seemed as if it was just chicken thighs cut up and heated up. I had to reheat my chicken when I got home because it was still pink (undercooked). The beef patties probably would've been good but they were extremely salty. All in all I probably won't be back. I really hope you guys don't disregard the negative comments because some changes really need to be made l, I wish you all the best of luck as a new business."}
{"text":"Food was great and the staff explained it with so much passion and love. These folk clearly care about what they are doing."}
{"text":"I'm so full of delicious gluten free food right now. House of Manchester is killing it. Beautiful presentation and incredible flavor. A feast for your eyes and your mouth. I wish I was able to savor it a little more but before I knew it I was staring at an empty plate and I had to loosen my belt a notch. Very attentive service, friendly staff and patrons when we stopped in. It feels like going to a good friend's house for a gourmet dinner. Looking forward to the next trip through town so we can explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I Came across this place looking for organic/vegan food. I figured I give it a try and....definitely wasn't disappointed. This place is a hidden Gem ! The food was well seasoned and tender. It will not be my last time here."}
{"text":"Oh my!! What a wonderful surprise!! The food was amazing and the dining was splendid. I ordered the wings and ox tail with plantains. Everything was seasoned perfectly, fresh, and hot!! Lastly the vanilla rum cake was to die for! I will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! It seriously has been a huge find. I had the ribs, wife had the chicken. Greatest Caribbean food ever. The young lady who sat us down was super friendly and nice. The chef came out and greeted me. Nice guy as well!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Good dining experience. 5 stars across the board.  Highly recommend The Smoked Jerk Ribs."}
{"text":"Nice complex flavor on Jamaican jerk chicken wings. Happy they are organic. Vegan gluten-free cinnamon apple monkfruit cake is delightfully cake-textured and yummy. Dining companion enjoyed the cafe mocha. Interesting use of ice where it matched the shape of the water glass, although regular ice might be more effective. Friendly service. Cute decor. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went with my family to try this place out wanted to try something new. Really good food the atmosphere is great. The service was excellent they are constantly checking to make sure you're doing ok and if you need anything. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise for my Mother's Day meal. The owner was very nice! The oxtails were so tender I could eat them with a plastic fork! The taste was infused with spices- just the way I expected. Don't let the outside fool you - very clean inside. I will visit every week!!!"}
{"text":"I can truly say this place was amazing! We were in town for a business meeting and one of our party needs to be gluten-free, dairy free, and egg-free in her dietary needs. One of the people in our party called up at noon trying to get reservations not realizing they were closed on a Saturday. However Grace, said they be happy to host us for the evening after our friend explained his wife's needs. We drove up and were amazed at the interior, the food, and the friendliness of both Grace and Mikael.  They were so patient and understanding, explaining all of the different types of foods they had in their attention to detail in knowing ingredients in all the foods they served was a real learning experience. Not being vegan myself, I was impressed with each of the meals I had: the pear burger, the Crab Bammy Bam Bam, and fried plantains. To finish the evening Michelle gave us each a sample of a ginger pineapple drink that he designed himself. Well I'm not the biggest fan of ginger, I thought it was amazing. Personally, we will certainly be coming back to here. Don't let the exterior of the building or the neighborhood deter you in the least. The inside and the food and the service is most surely worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a real review.  My wife and I went back for lunch again as we were out on this side of town.    This time I had the chicken fingers, not the meal just the fingers because we ordered a pizza to share as an appetizer.  They have two pizza's, one Vegan and one not.  We had the Pepperoni Roasted Garlic and it tasted really really good.  I forgot to say I had my smoothie again.  My wife had the Mandeville Wagyu Pear Burger which had some of the BEST seasoning on it I've ever had.  It was just awesome.  And of course I finished off with the Rum cake.  Did I mention how much I LOVE ME SOME RUM CAKE, however, after this one, there never will be one that can come close to comparing to this one.  Lastly, if you want to know what kind of place this place really is, let me clarify my opinion on the type of cuisine here.    Who out there has ever dreamed of a number of foods that you just love to eat and wished others could enjoy the same things as you?  Well, this Chef and his wife who have an extensive knowledge with spices and flavors from Mexico through Central America and other places, took a number of foods that they love to eat and decided to share those foods with a fusion style flare of tastes from around the world, and created something like no one else has anywhere else.  They decided to open up a place people can come and enjoy the Genuine LOVE they put into their style & flavor of foods and making people happy by sharing these flavor in an ORGANIC/NON GMO style that you CANNOT get anywhere else in the world.....  Now you can THINK you can come close to comparing the food you get here to something you may have had somewhere in your travels, but I promise you that you have NOT had ORGANIC, NON GMO flavors and flares like this anywhere else unless you got it from these guys because NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD DOES IT THE WAY THEY DO."}
{"text":"This has been the best Caribbean place yet  the smoked pimento spiced chicken was awesome! Well worth the price the tostone con queso was delicious as well I had it with vegan cheese sprinkled with a little Parmesan the people were very pleasant and helpful and the best part it's healthy this what I call real food I'm happy I went there tasty and Lollys don't have nothing on this place everything was fresh delicious tender I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Brought two gluten eaters with me and it was funny how the tables were turned, normally the menu has a handful of gluten-free items but everything on the menu is gluten free which is so refreshing! I don't normally eat Caribbean food so it was an adventure trying the food here. I loved everything i had, i started with a crab appetizer , had the chicken strip dinner, then took a couple of scones home ! Everything is fresh and you could tell that the chef definitely loves what he does! I really enjoyed the staff everyone was extremely friendly which can be hard to find. I recommend this place to everyone wanting to try something new and savory! So happy to start the New Year off with some great people!"}
{"text":"The outside looks kinda meh because of the area, but the inside is really nice! The food was delicious!! Parking is right on the street and very limited, but worth it and I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great place to dine or take out. Food was great,  especially the jerk wing and brisket tacos."}
{"text":"delicious oxtail with the most amazing rice and peas I've ever had. Plantains were also excellent not greasy but juicy."}
{"text":"While driving around downtown I thought I'd try for something different get some Island flavor so I stopped by this wonderful restaurant was pleasantly surprised as the exterior is far from grandiose but the interior is elegant clean and stylish. I ordered the crab Bam Bam to start with a tomato basil which is good flavor Hardy with a little heat and Spice next was an accompaniment of macaroni and cheese that was baked with good flavor piping hot and a ganic Italian salad. The veggie rundown was the biggest surprise of all great flavor and mixing of the sweet potatoes the pumpkin the peppers over the rice Hardy great flavor sweet but not too sweet a good meal Grace was my server and she was excellent very attentive but then again I was the only person in the place so I had her full attention LOL. I absolutely enjoyed my dining experience here recommend it come check it out"}
{"text":"Staff gets upset and calls you a bigot when you write a review that they don't like. I wrote a review on their Facebook page saying that our food was cold when it came out which we waited an hour and a half for it and had to send it back to have it rewarmed. I did compliment on their jerk Wings which were good but some of them were undercooked. The staff was very friendly when we were there but after we wrote a review on their Facebook page they started calling us names and accusing us of writing false reviews about their company and the three that were written were all from different people that were all in our party when we went there last Saturday. The owners reply was very unprofessional and we will never return to that business. The food was not authentic. And they are very understaffed. Oh by the way they were serving us tap water with a bunch of particles floating in the bottom of the glass once the ice melted."}
{"text":"Really great food! Owner had a great story. I've had the jerk chicken and the burger. Really like the bread on the burger. Ooo the plantains!!!! Yasss child...I be stealing all my friends plantains before eating mine."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. I had an issue and the actual \"OWNER\" corrected it immediately.  Blew my mind. I appreciate restaurants like this. Get the \"Braised OxTails\" you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The outside of this place is deceiving for sure but inside it is a cute little spot.. ordered dinner over the grub hub app & picked up. Upon arrival the one thing that stood out was the exceptional cleanliness. Tables were set, nothing was out of place. Good first impression. Food was good, serving sizes well portioned. AUTHENTIC flavor. All hot and fresh upon pick up. Overall good experience we will be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice and tasty food. Small intimate setting. Food customized to your taste. All dishes are organic and gluten free too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down best fried chicked ive ever had. Cassava everything left our party feeling good and healthy, while rejuvenated for our road trip. I have to admit the decor is weird, but the authentic food and friendly service males this place a 5 star stop!"}
{"text":"This is a totally gluten free restaurant!  The food is unique and very good. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"The reviews from others didn't disappoint. Service was TOP NOTCH! Food was good, nice size portions. Very quaint atmosphere in a very off the beaten path location. Grace and Mikel went out of their way to make us feel like valued customers and gave us quite a bit of info on the food and Carribean culture. They also do carry out. If you stop by, tell 'em the Wizard sent you!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious food, and friendly wonderful service. The waitress went above and beyond to make sure we were all taken care of."}
{"text":"Hidden in an unassuming spot near DTLV, House of Manchester cooks up what is easily the best Caribbean food in town using fresh organic ingredients. Owners have an incredible story and truly support the community, too. The nonprofit where I work had an event and House of Manchester went out of their way to take care of us. Love yall and your chicken!!"}
{"text":"Great food in an unexpected place.  Had to run out of the office to pick up a quick lunch and remembered the wife mentioned this place recently. Definitely a pleasant surprise.  I'm no expert on Caribbean cuisine but I do some smoking at home, and from that experience I can say the food is cooked wonderfully. The jerk chicken wasn't too spicy but had great seasoning and smokey flavor. Also had the cabbage and carrots as well as the fried plantains. Both were great, the plantains in particular had a unique taste. (Maybe to do with the coconut oil.) Finally, had the beef pastry patty which was completely new to me. A little on the salty side but very flavorful and the homemade crust was just the right amount of crunchy on the edges and soft in the middle.  The service was great, very friendly, and everything came out piping hot when I got back to work to eat. Will definitely be back and bringing friends along."}
{"text":"Found our new go to spot! Excellent food and excellent service. I'm full and I don't feel heavy. So thankful everything is healthy."}
{"text":"We just at here for the first but definitely not last time. Wow, what a hidden little gem! The service was outstanding but can we talk about the food!! Super fresh and loaded with vibrant spices and flavors! My husband is an executive chef and he was soooo impressed! The owner took time to talk to us about our upcoming trip to Jamaica and what foods to try while we're there. It will be interesting to compare with the local fare there. But we came to this place to dip our toes in Caribbean cuisine and man, this place didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"First of all..I would have given this a 5 star if it hadn't been for them being understaffed and not prepared to handle a large party that was ahead of us. With that being said...the food was EXCELLENT! This place is a hidden gem. It's quite small and has very limited seating but  the ambience was very nice.  It's located in an industrial area and wedged in between a couple of run down businesses. Service was great...and the food was even better.  Very fresh and flavorful. You could taste the flavor profile in each dish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little tough to find, but has a great atmosphere inside. I had the brisket sandwich with plantains, salad and rice with peas. Everything was excellent and made fresh to order.  The plating was also very nice and above what I expected at this price point. I will definitely come back the next time I am in this area of town."}
{"text":"Oasis! Respite! A Savoury savior~!   Located near Fiesta on a desolate industrial road this little place has delicious food. Organic!  The mango banana smoothie is off the chain.   The curried garlic appetizer is exquisite.  Lots of vegetarian and vegan options.  Even sugar free dessert options! I will definitely be returning on the reg."}
{"text":"What a nice spot. We actually showed up 30 mins before closing and they took care of us. The food was amazing and the customer service was top notch. We will definetly be back for more."}
{"text":"Good food, freshly made although not a \"juice bar\" of any sort as claimed. They have juice but not fresh squeezed. The food was good authentic carribean food in a small dining room which feels like you are in someone's home dining room which is kind of pleasant. Only 4 tables or so inside so it is small keep in mind."}
{"text":"Excellent service, cute place, very good food.... My wife and I went on a Sunday afternoon. A quintessential Yelp find. The place was empty, but it's pretty small. 4 4-person tables and another 4 spots at the bar. Plus it's in a not-nice part of town. But the inside is way nicer than I expected. Just one girl working as the host/server/cook/dishwasher. We ordered the oxtail and the goat curry. Oxtail was better, but the goat was very good too (not too spicy). The steamed cabbage salad was good too. Vanilla rum cake with vanilla ice cream were also great. All-in-all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the other reviews are misleading so This is Real review...  My husband and I just got back from Jamaica so we were craving Jamaican Food and came across this restaurant on Yelp. The owners are very nice and helpful, attentive, etc. However, it's extremely evident that there's very little experience in waiting tables in a restaurant. Dirty dishes piled up on the table and weren't cleared before bringing out our food. Next, the wait... we got there around 6pm and ordered pretty quickly. We didn't get out of there until 7:45pm and our sides came out about 20 minutes before the food. The food wasn't hot. We had to have it warmed up. As for the taste, it was cool but it wasn't authentic Jamaican Food at all. We all agreed the jerk wings were good but all of us (party of four) were disappointed with our main dishes, which consisted of...  curry goat, curry chicken, and jerk chicken. Honestly, I'm in the car on the way home holding trying to keep my food down. I respect anyone pursuing their on business career but this restaurant needs to make some improvements or you won't be in business very long.   **Response How dare you accuse me of writing false reviews. This is the only review that I have written regarding your business PERIOD. The other Yelp review that you had removed was my husband's. I don't have time to sit here and write multiple reviews. I said what I have to say and it is what it is. I didn't like the main course. The wings were good but a few were undercooked. And to correct your statement I wasn't the one who asked if The chef was Jamaican  and the person who asked didn't DEMAND anything it was just a simple yes or no question, so get your facts straight before you reply. Oh and the last time I checked people in the same party/ group are still individuals and each and every one of them are entitled to their OWN OPINION! I thought the customer service was great until now. We were super friendly the entire time despite the extremely long wait and our disappointment with the taste of the food. The simple fact is you can't handle constructive criticism. You would've been better off not saying anything because now you've only displayed what type of business owner you are. UNPROFESSIONAL."}
{"text":"Really good and fresh Caribbean food I recommend trying the food. We tried the vegetarian dish vegetable run and Jamaican chicken and the family bread was excellent and the macaroni and cheese was to die for. The service was excellent friendly the restaurant was very clean and I thought the temperature was perfect"}
{"text":"The food and the Decour make absolutely no sense whatsoever but the food is good  The name was misleading because I thought that this would be an English pub But what do I know I guess there's a place in the Caribbean called Manchester but then again England did own parts of the Caribbean I don't know I'm just confused but whatever"}
