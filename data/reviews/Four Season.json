{"text":"I was just at Shiki. The service was great and hand rolls is one of the best I had around town. Couple of bad things. The menu selections are not that great and they limit certain items such as sashimi, shrimp tempura, etc. No eel or unagi in their dinner menu. I will not return again considering the price I paid for the menu selections."}
{"text":"Is there a way to choose 0 star?   Went at 5:30 with a party of 16, there's only 1 lady taking order. She would take order for one family, runs away, comes back with food after 15min,then take the next order for next family.  Asked for cups and water but was just ignored.  Finally took order and got food after 1.5 hours.  The pork bone soup was just spicy but not very tasty. Salmon is a bit burnt.  There seems to be only 2 people running the whole restaurant. At the end, the whole dining room was filled with smoke from the kitchen.. I would stay away..."}
{"text":"Went a few days after they changed from the old place.  Food was okay but nothing to rave about.   Below par if you compare it to Japanese Korean place around Yonge and Finch area.  Pickled Cabbage appetizers were above average.  Service was fine.  Price versus value is not there if your expecting to be wowed."}
{"text":"Whenever I want to eat sushi for all you eat, I go there. Most of AUCE restaurants serve small sashimi and big rice because unit price of sashimi are more expensive but I like this restaurant because big sashimi on top based on small rice exactly real Japanese style so I can eat more sashimi when ordering AUCE menu. A little expensive but if you compare with other AUCEs which more expensive and worse quality. This restaurant is gentle!"}
{"text":"IV been there a couple times and have had great service with good sushi. I went there with a friend today and received the worst sushi I have ever had. The sea weed looked old and wrinkly and was impossible to chew and swallow. My water had a bug in it and when I told the server she wasn't able to understand me and simply got me a new glass of water. Ill never go back there since it has ruined my sushi experience!!!"}
{"text":"We Love this place. Quality Sushi in a classic style without all the creamy mayo dressings. Takeout platters are a great value and they are flexible with substitutions. It's always our first choice."}
{"text":"Should be no stars....please don't go! We were there for dinner. Greasy food, rude waiters and expensive. As an example, We ordered tea and the waiter bought us what was essentially hot water with few tea small leafs floating in the bottom of the cup. When I inquired when was this tea made he arrogantly replied 'in the morning'. I had to ask him to replace and he walked away and brought me another cup without a word of apology or offer to replace for my husband. Also not once he approached us during the meal to inquire if we needed anything. I had to flag another waiter to get the bill. 

Too bad, it used to be busy place with delicious food, good prices and polite & efficient service and now under new owners no wonder it sits nearly empty on Friday night. We'll never come back or Recommed"}
{"text":"Great take away trays. Always fresh, skillfully prepared and ready on time. Staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch. We both ordered from the Korean portion of the menu. The side dishes were yummy. My spicy tofu soup had a lot of tofu and vegetables. The only thing missing was kimchi in the soup to give it that bite (which I thought was a staple in tofu soup?). My husbands pork bone soup had a lot of meat in it. Overall a nice lunch. Our waiter was really friendly and happy too!"}
{"text":"I went here a year ago and had the best shabu shabu I've ever had. I went here tonight I was so upset. I live downtown and I called them and asked them what time they close. The man said they close at 10:30. We got there at 10:00 and as soon as we pulled up all the people in the restaurant saw us coming and turned off the lights. We went inside and they said they were closed. I told them that we drove all the way from downtown (45 minutes) because they told us it was open until 10:30 and the guy pretended to not know what I was talking about. Honestly, they were so rude and awful, I'm never going back there again."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The new head chef is quite famous around the Korean restaurant business actually. Try out all the hot Korean foods and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Shiki Sushi is one of the worst joints i've ever been too. Its in a great location for me, but I've been there twice and i will never go back again.

I went there for brunch the first time with two of my friends..the service was amazing, and the japanese plum wine was delicious. ALSO THEY SERVE THE SUSHI IN BOATS! That was awesome.

But thats where the buck stops.

In the two times i've been there, i've found that 

1. The amount of rice they put into their maki rolls is disgusting. You can barely see any of the other toppings. I guess their goal is to try and fill you up on rice so you dont cost them to much.

2. We ordered the chicken teriyaki...i have never ever in my life had chicken teriyaki that tasted like...despair. 

3. Not against the restaurant, but both times I was there, there were some sketchy patrons.


I'm sorry Shiki, i gave you two tries. But you're not worth it,"}
{"text":"Sushi is back and better than ever!  After transforming to a Korean only restaurant for about a year, now Shi ki is both Korean and Japanese.  They have two menus. We were ecstatic to see the sushi sign go back up on the weekend. We went there on Tuesday night and we weren't disappointed. The sushi is even better than before but no longer all you can eat.   Thank you Shi ki!"}
{"text":"This name of the restaurant is misleading - should be called Shiki Korean restaurant. It is a mom&pop Korean restaurant in Richmond hill area, serving authentic Korean cuisine. 
Ordered steamed dumpling and Korean Shabu shabu, very fresh ingredients and homemade dipping sauce. Service is politely and friendly , an easy 5 star level. 

Didn't try the jap food here because why coming to a Korean restaurant for Sushi."}
{"text":"So now i'm getting into the bad reviews.

Shiki used to be awesome. They cared about health (low sodium everything) and their food quality and presentation was good.
Then they got greedy i guess.
and then they started cutting back on everything.
And then they limited the number of Kalbi a person can eat to 5 pieces.
This was the final straw. 
I'm never going back.

One of my best friends who lives in Chicago loves this place. He makes it a point to eat here atleast 3 times during his visits. Even he gets why it's shit now."}
{"text":"2.5 based on my one lunch experience so I am going to round up to 3

Four Season used to be a Shabu Shabu hot pot place but I guess with the change of the season and now it is a Sushi and Korean restaurant.

The interior is the same minus the hot pot element on the table. The menu though has Japanese item like sushi in. There are so many other sushi restaurants in the area and is Four Season good enough to compete?

Lunch special till 3:30 pm with a mixture of Korean and Japanese offering. I was in the mood for some spicy beef but sadly the waitress told me it was not available.

Tempura Lunch Bento ($9.99) Good as a lunch portion. Sadly the tempura which was suppose to be the star of the show was not too well prepared. The batter was too thick to my liking, though the shrimps were fresh. 

Watermelon to end the meal was a nice touch.

The new menu now is extensive, It is as thick as a book. So maybe other items would taste better? 

Service was fast and friendly. I was presented with the bill without requesting, Rude or efficient? I say just Asian efficiency."}
