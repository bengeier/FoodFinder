{"text":"Yep  Thoroughly enjoyed this tiny gem. A little crowded but surprisingly we did not mind.   Hands down the maple fried challah with fried chicken was wonderful. Seriously.  It should be illegal.   We also completely enjoyed the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote and candied bacon and the waffles with cheddar and deep fried chicken. And we LOVE LOVE LOVE that they serve real maple syrup.   The waffles were perfectly light and fluffy and the lemon ricotta pancakes had a genuine and tasty lemon finish on the palate. Really clean and kept all the sweetness in check.   But the challah french toast.  Oh dear.  Crack cocaine is less addictive. I predict that we will be back. .. and will weigh at least 20 pounds more in a few short months.... thank heavens this is not offered at night or we would be in serious trouble.  Ignore the crowded space order the maple fried challah with fried chicken at brunch and you will be happy. Very VERY happy. (And the fried chicken is awesome too... by the way).   Erin our waitress was efficient enthusiastic without being annoying, and she was very helpful.  We waddled out happy and intend to waddle back again and often."}
{"text":"Un peu déçu le menu un peu rocambolesque et très gras ! Cependant j'y ai mangé l'un des meilleurs pain doré !"}
{"text":"Impossibly crumbley and unable to hold up against the cold compound butter, there was already so much butter used in the scone that it was practically a biscuit worthy of Paula Deen's last indulgence meal before bypass surgery."}
{"text":"There was about a 20 minute wait on a Saturday around 1pm, but that's like all brunch places in Montreal. We sat comfortably at the bar and would probably ask to sit their next time as well. I had never heard of the Bulgarian Benedict but it looked delicious and boy was it ever! 2 breakfasts and 2 coffees came to 29$. I was so impressed, I plan on going back for dinner."}
{"text":"Was looking for a romantic brunch to end my  5 year anniversary trip with the hubs. Stumbled upon  prohibitions  menu and decided to go, even though we were staying in downtown montreal it looked too good to  pass up. Well we all know by now looks can be deciving .  We were seated outside without a choice of inside seating when we  arrived, right at 10am, first customers. Our waitress, a ditzy redhead was less fan interested in our needs. When I asked for the wifi password, so I could call my babies in the states, I was told \" uh we aren't that kind of place.\"  Um, ok. We didn't receive food or drink for over an hour. The food was \"meh\" at best. Services continued to disappoint. Finally got to leave 2 hours after we sat down and had never been so relieved."}
{"text":"Went to Prohibition for Sunday brunch. I ordered the eggs benedict. The taste was strange and i was finished in about 2 minutes flat. Now I'm already thinking about lunch because I'm still hungry.  On a side note, the chairs were uncomfortable and the noise level unpleasant. I would avoid this place unless you're looking for strange food and poor service."}
{"text":"The food is not surprising.  We ordered the  french toast since they seem quite famous in this restaurant.  But actually I don't like it so much. They are not cooked like the normal french toast, I think they are deep fried like donut which make them very greasy.  And they fried chicken to go with it tastes good but also very greasy.  My husband ordered huevos rancheros.  Taste is normal.  No surprising.  Won't go back again."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the server was extremely rude... doesn't worth waiting outside for 25 minutes :("}
{"text":"Excellent spot, service is friendly and fast, great ambiance. Matt, the owner, is behind the bar, he makes this place stand out. And make sure to try the fries, they are exquisite!"}
{"text":"This place is nice,  I enjoyed the fry chicken.  However,  the French toast,  was oily.  I will go back there again this time, I will try something else."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken and waffles.  The food was decent but the portions are strange.  The chicken piece is very small compared to the french toast, which takes up about 75% of the meal.  I ended up leaving most of the french toast uneaten...it got kinda boring after a while with no other meal complement.  Some extra fruit would have been nice.  Aside from the decent food, the service was pretty horrible.  The waitress got my drink order wrong, never checked up on us, and was impossible to flag down.  All the wait staff I dealt with were very curt and unaccommodating.  I also saw them get neighboring tables' orders wrong.  Plenty of other places in the area to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch! I came in with my baby in her car seat and was welcomed without hesitation. The service was lovely and the lemon-ricotta pancakes were spot on."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch place in all of ..The world! Do not skip out on the Bulgarian breakfast ! It's garlic heaven . Heaven!!! The rice pudding is actually also amazing . I love my brunch people, it makes me happy, and this place takes the cake. The challah and fried chicken is nice, but there are many incredible options! Don't forget to change it up."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! Great atmosphere. I had the fried French toast and chicken, it was absolutely delicious tasted like a mix of French toast and a beaver tail. Girlfriend had the lemon to ricotta pancakes and said they were delicious."}
{"text":"This place is HANDS-DOWN the best brunch place in Monkland -- and even NDG.  Every single one of their menu items are so well thought out and, of course, delicious.  If it's your first time there, you should definitely go for the french toast and fried chicken.  It sounds ridiculous, but it works so well!  The only slightly blah item on the menu is the breakfast sandwich, but from a strategic standpoint, I can see that this is an item for the less adventurous of patrons.  They also have really good service, but make sure to make reservations because this tiny place gets packed up pretty quickly.  Oh and as of last week, they are doing a dinner service.  And they have an authentic southern fried chicken dish that I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Breakfast first timer alert! I've been a few times for dinner and drinks. Their breakfasts are just as inventive as their dinners. Great friendly bilingual staff. Great patio out front too."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to come here for brunch. Wow, it's so busy!! But they clearly know what the fan faves are because we received our food in less than 5 minutes of ordering. We ate leisurely and even chatted a bit after our meal and were still in and out of there in about 50 minutes.   Had the french toast + fried chicken, and hubby had the eggs benny. As much as I love fried food (and I really, really do) I wouldn't order the french toast/fried chicken again. As most other reviewers note, since the french toast is deep fried, it's more like a donut and no longer tastes like french toast. So if you're looking for the slightly egg-tasting, lightly crispy French toast-- you won't get that here. And while the fried chicken was good -- it's just fried chicken and not really exceptionally good. There are other places that make better fried chicken nearby (mon ami, dawa for example) that I wouldn't be coming here just for that.  Eggs benny was delicious. Very garlic-ky, and I loved the combo of feta cheese + spicy sauce. If we come back here for brunch, I would get the eggs benny next time."}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch.  Very original plates and extremely tasteful.  Highly recommended for brunch"}
{"text":"It definitely lived up to the hype. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote and bacon. It was the best bacon I'd ever had, and the pancakes were light and just perfect. My friend had the benedict (which they serve with a side of toasted strips of bread for the purposes of dunking in the sauce), which also received rave reviews.  The host was really friendly and helped us try to make sense of what to order, and our server was attentive and had a good sense of humor.  I'm curious to try their dinner too, but can't imagine it could beat the brunch."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Montreal by far. Just writing this review makes me want to go there. They also have a great dinner menu. And if you haven't been around for dinner yet, GO! You will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"My sister and I are here to enjoy the brunch. The Huevos Rancheros are en pointe, and while the Shakshoukan is freshly made, it misses the tasty element; however, the highlight of this meal is the lemon-ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote.  I'm rather enjoying the unusually moist but pleasant chocolate-orange scones. The smell of cocoa is enticing but as I bite into it, I realize I want this scone more...chocolatey. While my sister tells me this is usual, I have to add that I'm not subtle ... The staff is very affable and helpful (thank you Julie). My drink order is mixed up and my scone forgotten, but I highly appreciate that the waitress comes to me, brings up the oversight and fesses up quickly: and of course, I get my scone. As I finish the meal, I feel a sweet sadness as I enjoy the last morsel. I will be back for another hopefully satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch spot hands down.  Please note they don't take reservation and the wait is on average 20 minutes . The service is awesome and the food is delicious .  The place is small so the tables are close to each other so you can reach out and touch your neighbor lol . Warning they don't alter the menu so no special request ."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best bunch in NDG. Friendly and efficient staff and the food is so incredible that you forget there's no alcohol! French toast and chicken and Bulgarian Benedict are my favorites, but nothing on the menu will disappoint."}
{"text":"Their \"Oeufs bulgares\" are my favourite brunch item in Montreal. Nothing beats it! When you know that's what the staff eats after they finish their shift, you know that they've got something. Must love garlic but I prefer it to any eggs benny in town!"}
{"text":"Embarrassingly small portions and average quality. Unfortunate that once such a delicious restaurant has reduced their standards. I don't know if there's a new owner, chef, or they're trying to cut their costs but prohibition isn't worth anyone's time or money. Bite sized breakfasts that leave you starved!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, had their French toast and fried chicken during brunch. The chicken was juicy and tender. I thought the French toast would be very sweet, but it was actually just right.  We also ordered the corn tortilla with fried egg. It  had taco toppings. Full of flavours and the guac tasted fantastic. Their house hot sauce was amazing with the corn tortilla.   Will definitely be coming back next time we visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Loved the Bulgarian eggs Benedict but not enough bread which they charge for. Otherwise their well edited menu is well executed."}
{"text":"Returned last nlght and I'm pleased to report several improvements. While my dining companion commented that she liked the mason jars as water glasses, I said I disliked them. Well, I guess I was overheard and my glass was promptly replaced by a regular glass filled with ice water. Our charming waitress, Erin, proceeded to recite that nights specials, interesting appetizers and mains, including a cod dish - smart to add a fish option. My friend loved the polenta I recommended and I thoroughly enjoyed the pork belly dish - the  creamy celery root puree and radicchio salad were perfect accompaniments to a tender, luscious  piece of pork that was crisped on the top.  Yum! Washed it all down with a Beau honey beer - perfect combo. My friend couldn't pass on dessert and I must admit that her key lime pie was probably the best I've tasted - and I've had many, including Florida. This one had lime zest and a perfect graham crust, delicious balance of sweet and sour. Service was friendly, enthusiastic and attentive. My single complaint is the noise level is practically unbearable - luckily we had arrived early enough that the room filled up only as we were about ready to leave."}
{"text":"Creative menu, well composed plates. The only down side it's the size and noise of the place but nothing that can't be overlooked to enjoy the quality of the food here."}
{"text":"Our last meal in Montreal and I still hadn't tried Poutine! Thankfully disaster was averted since poutine was on the menu at Prohibition. As soon as I found it, I didn't even bother to read the rest of the menu. My husband got the fried chicken with French toast. The food looked great when it arrived in under 5 Mins. Mine looked like I could get a heart attack from it - with a base of fries and fried chicken, topped with cheese curds, gravy and pieces of bacon.. This isn't your everyday lunch fare. I dug in but only made it through half before I got full. The fried chicken in my poutine and my husband's fried chicken were the same I think. His was more crispier and mine a little softer because of the toppings I assumed. His French toast was delicious too and he kept saying it reminded him of the beignets we had in New Orleans just a few weeks before.   Service was good but the space is a little cramped. The folks dining there seemed to be locals so we were glad to have found a little neighborhood favorite. It is kinda hard to notice if you're just driving past."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Went for brunch so it was packed but got a place almost immediately. Only thing was food took a while to get our order. Worth the wait though."}
{"text":"This place is dangerously good. Like, I have to forget I live round the corner from it, it's so good. They do dinner as well, but I've never experienced it so I'll stick to the many brunches I've had there for this review.  If it's your first time, you MUST try the deep-fried Challah French toast with fried chicken. It is what dreams (and heart attacks) are made of! Ask for an order of sugar bacon on the side, BECAUSE YOU CAN.  Little-known fact for locals: They will do take away orders if you have a hungover group of friends needing deep-fried French Toast and you live close by... #JustSaying  Other highlights, that hardly ever eclipse the French toast for me but are delicious nonetheless:  - Bulgarian Benedict: if you feel like something savoury and love garlic, this creamy take on eggs benedict is pretty cool and a healthier option on the menu. The garlicky yoghurt and eggs combo is surprisingly satisfying. Great option for anyone avoiding carbs or bread (gluten-free or paleo peeps) - although it comes with a couple of toasted baguette slices you could ask them to skip them and the meal is wheat-free and satisfying.   - Blueberry lemon-ricotta pancakes: These are lovely, and come with awesome sugar bacon (which as I mentioned above you can add as a side to anything because YES!!!). They will never trump the French Toast for the sweet-toothed though, which is a little sad.  In general I've never been impressed with any of the bagels or sandwiches here, I just feel like other breakfast/brunch joints do them better. The breakfast poutine was pretty good, but not a standout for me. The Shakshouka (sp?) is a fun more spicy and flavourful dish to try, but I've made better at home (if you never try or cook this kind of cuisine though, it's worth giving this dish a go!)   Their cocktails are nice and so are the scones.  Really awesome spot, with lots going for it, a Monkland Village gem!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh prohibition I love you , but you did me wrong last time I saw you...I will be back soon!   This spot is awesome for brunch. Then again I never been for nothing else than that. The menu is ultra simple , specially for indecisive gals or lads like me ! That particular Sunday I opted for the famous \"maple fried challah french toast,  and fried chicken\" and my other half got the \"buttermilk biscuit ,homemade pork sausage, eggs with fries \"  Since my bf is a little difficult when it comes to his eggs I made sure I asked our waitress how the egg was cooked . She responded it was a fried egg. We thought fried okay okay no runny yolk. Our food came and looked so delicious but one problem his egg was done over easy with the yolk running wild! He was not a happy camper. Worst of it there was a hair in his food. I didn't want to make a big deal about the hair since things like that can happen. So I just removed it, and started digging in my evenly plate. Poor babe he wasn't able to eat his food due to the eggs yolk running all over his plate . We told the waitress , she was nice but said its stated in the menu that the egg is over easy. I didn't see that nowhere lol... That's why I made sure I asked before ordering. Anyways she took the plate and the manager I'm guessing brought in another plate.  One problem there was a hair in that one too! On the bright side the egg was well done! My boyfriend wanted to make them aware of the hair. This time we didn't ask for a new plate , too much trouble. I was getting a bit annoyed because my food was perfect and I was getting cold , heck it was already cold!  Anyways they comped his plate ( nice) my food was delish. No complaints for me! My boyfriend did enjoy his meal minus the hair.  Service was good, staff is super cool. This place get jam pack real quick! You must check it out or you will be missing out on an amazing brunch spot ! Yes I will be back, hiccups happens !"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for brunch where I had the Bénédictine bulgare ufs pochés/bulgarian Benedict with poached eggs, garlic yogurt, sheep's feta, paprika oil on a toasted baguette.  If you're not a fan of garlic or sheep's milk cheese, steer clear!  This stuff is potent.   Weird of me to not have ordered the fried chicken on French toast, but whatever - there's always next time.   Friendly staff, a short wait on a Sunday morning (we waited about 5 minutes), and a relatively ample variety of brunch items made it great to suit a variety of tastes in our group of friends."}
{"text":"Here I am, on the road again There I go, turn the page.. Well you walk into a restaurant, Strung out from the road, And you feel the eyes upon you As you're shakin' off the cold...  ...that was me, walking from the bitter cold winter morning into Prohibition.  There is nothing better than finding perfect little restaurant for brunch or lunch on a long road trip.  I found this place just before I hit the long road thru the mountains and back home. I wanted to say \"good bye and till next time\" to Montréal. (I admit, I am a sucker for cool restaurant names - and this one came highly recommended to boot)  A cup of hot coffee, corner seat at the bar (mind you, place was packed 10 min after opening), ricotta pancakes topped with blueberries and candied bacon (BACON!). Plus maple syrup in a cutest glass jar ala #wtfming. (If you don't know what that hashtag means, I pity you, fool. jk)  Bliss."}
{"text":"The saddest review I'll ever have to write knowing that all the delicious food will never be tasted again. Hoping they'll come back ? Anyways prohibition was my favourite brunch spot with mimosa or bloody ceaser refills priced insanely cheap you already had me but once I tasted those chicken and french toast plates you threw me over board. Honestly pictures speak for themselves. Open up again would ya please ?"}
{"text":"Unlike most of the Yelpers who have given Prohibition 4 and 5 star reviews we visited the resto for dinner, not brunch. We enjoyed ourselves and thought that the food was good, but not up to a 4 or 5 star experience as the they seem to be with brunch.   We arrived earlish on a Saturday evening as we were meeting up with some friends across town after dinner. Tables were booked solid, but there was space at the bar. The bartender who served us our drinks and food did an excellent job and seemed like a really nice guy, so A+ on the service. The restaurant filled up quickly and had a nice atmosphere. Early into the evening a musician arrived and began to play the piano. It was nice to have the live music, but given the small size of the establishment it made it a bit difficult to chat.   We ordered a kale salad, calamari and the vege pizza. The salad was the best of the group with great flavour and fresh ingredients. The calamari was pretty good, light, crispy and served with a tangy lemon & saffron mayo. The pizza was ok, but not really my cup of tea. The crust, which was home made, was thick and very chewy and had a sweet flavour. There was a large amount of cheese on the pizza which made the whole thing a bit oily.   By the time we were completing our main course the pianist had started up his second set and was now joined by a horn player. Adding a trumpet to the mix in this small space made it impossible to carry on a conversation so in the end I feel that the live music was a bit of a detractor from the ambiance of the place.   For dessert we ordered the home made doughnuts. The doughnuts are actually doughnut holes and were served with ice cream and blueberries. The texture and taste of the doughnuts was very similar to the pizza dough. Not to take away from this dessert, but I would categorize it as \"not worth the calories\", however I'm not the worlds biggest doughnut fan to begin with."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch with an original menu. You'll find hangover Quebec breakfast choices like poutine and fried chicken. The fried pain doré was a little too intense for me-everything is fried topped with maple sirup- but I guess some will love it. We will definitely go back in NDG just for having another brunch at that place."}
{"text":"Are you on a somewhat healthy diet? Don't come here...  This is a few blocks from my house and it's a dangerous location...because I might gain some serious weight from the house specialty, fried chicken and french toast.  Now, the traditional Southern dish has been tweaked to, IMO, a better pairing. The french toast is enormous, yet light and I could eat another serving easily. It doesn't bore your taste buds at all. The fried chicken, is one of the nicest offerings I've had so far in Montreal.  However, my personal hangover favourite, is the shakshuka. Libyan by origin, this all-around savoury meal is great for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's a very versatile dish and Prohibition does a wonderful take on it. Baked eggs over tomatoes, with hints of paprika and cumin, oh yes, my head and stomach feel better already. If you can't make it down here to NDG to try it, it's an easy home meal to create.  I only wish their coffee was better, but that's minor pickings. Make reservations, as this space is small."}
{"text":"I had the french toast and fried chicken with maple syrup and a coffee and it was all delicious. Cute small space within the heart of the Monkland village and very popular. Great service and had the line been longer they would have been willing to take our names and call us for our spot. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch (on a Friday!). It was delicious and service was warm and excellent. We had the buglarian benedict which was decadent. It is garlicky as people said but really delicious. The special was a pumpkin scone which was deliciously moist. We also ordered the fried chicken + french toast. The chicken was juicy with a tasty batter and the french toast was really really good - definitely comfort food though so pretty heavy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"THE Summer Brunch destination. Everything was perfect, taste, ambience, service, portions, plating. I took Citron and Blueberry Pancakes and they were delicious to say the least. The buttermilk pancakes were clean and fluffy and the citrus flavour was such a good complement to the blueberries and maple syrup. They also changed my bacon for Fried Chicken and god were they heavenly! The fried chicken was spicy and crispy at the same time. Literally finger lickin good. The portion was also so perfect that you feel fulfilled enough without having over eatean.   My boyfriend took the Breakfast Poutine and it was one of the best poutines I've tried. It had fried chicken and sugared bacon which beautifully balances the saltiness of the fries and cheese. The egg on top was another brilliant addition which makes the entire meal all the more pleasant and enjoyable.  The staff was very friendly and the owner kept on checking on us too. We sat outiside and our table did not have a shade so the heat was really annoying but then we changed to a table with an umbrella and the weather felt superb then. To top it all, there was a person playing great music on the public piano accross the street!  P.S. I have a soft spot for places that serve coffee for free with their breakfast and this place does."}
{"text":"Being generous, because they've only been in their new location for 2 weeks and may still be working out the kinks. Asked the woman who filled our water glasses what someone at a neighbouring tables was eating, and she shrugged and said \"I'm only the bus boy.\" Waiter took our orders without informing us of the specials - we thought the short menu offered our only options. I asked the busboy/girl for bread with my meal salad and she was confused and said we should ask our waiter. ?? He seemed equally confused by the request, but did manage to provide some nice, warm soft slices of baguette. When I told him, nicely, that it would have been helpful to have been informed of the specials, he looked thoughtful and said \"oh.\" No apologies. Still the beet salad was decent (if a bit sweet) and the salmon tartare was also tasty. My husband said it was a very good burger and the fries were good. We may give them another chance once they have been there a while. We'll make sure to ask about the specials."}
{"text":"Great place. Went for brunch.  Nice variety of dishes.  I had the He eggs Benedict and my daughter had the French toast and deep fried chicken Looking forward to trying it for dinner"}
{"text":"Recently made my way back to Prohibition for another brunch and I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Montreal.  Again I went with the Maple Challah French Toast and Fried Chicken and again it was absolutely superb.  Also ordered a side of bacon that was fabulous as well.  I'll return every time I visit Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Prohibition Montreal's menu sold me on its promise of comfort food and cocktails. At the entry, my boyfriend and I were welcomed by a sanded-down, gold-brushed piano covered in candles. The owner greeted us warmly and since the restaurant was quite full on a Thursday, we sat at the bar.   We immediately accepted the cocktail special - \"Bourbon Apple Pie\". It was rich and smooth served over ice and stirred with a cinnamon stick, but we both agreed it would have been a perfect warm drink. I ordered the mushroom risotto and my boyfriend chose the fried chicken dinner.   We waited a noticeable length of time for our food. The risotto came out thick and un-gourmet looking, but it had great flavor and hit the spot for me. It was made with portobello and wild mushrooms and topped with pecorino and fontina cheeses. The fried chicken dinner was done with no mistakes, but lacked a bit of original flare. The chicken crunched and crackled when attacked from the outside and came through tender on the inside. It was served with green beans and garlic mashed potatoes. I would have expected a creative side dish with the chicken dinner to make Prohibition's rendition stand out, but there was certainly nothing to complain about.   If we had not been driving, we might have been tempted by the 2 dinner special + bottle of wine for $66 - quite the steal! Overall, the experience was squarely above average, but not outstanding. I will reserve final judgment, however, until I sample their brunch. I have heard nothing but rave reviews about the creative twist they put on their sweet batters and eggs."}
{"text":"Delicious creative food. I had the Bulgarian Benedict. My wife had the Morning Sunshine salad.  The Benedict consisted of two poached eggs served on a bed of garlic infused yogurt and Bulgarian feta drizzled in a small bath of paprika oil. The texture was perfect, enough to provide contrast to the delicate eggs. The milder feta was a good balance to the yolk but not as bracing as a traditional savory French or Greek feta. Surrounding the plate were a selection of toast for dipping. It was entirely satisfying and pleasantly not as heavy as your typical béchamel based Benedict.   The salad consisted of kale, hard boiled quail eggs, waffle croutons, triangular slices of cheese topped with a vinaigrette on the sweeter side. It was served on a wooden square block which made for a welcome break from your typical brunch-fare plates. It scored points for originality. The vinaigrette could have used a little more acid and the kale needed to be massaged a bit more to work out some of the coarser bites. Nonetheless these are minor quibbles and my wife was content with her food.  The staff was warm and friendly.  Overall this was one of our most enjoyable brunch meals in Montreal which in our experience has been crowded with uninspired outings.  Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Just got back from brunch at this place.  It is the most beautiful day in Montreal this year! We sat outside, ate Huevos Rancheros ( well If you are from California or Mexico or Texas, you must know that outside of these places, basically eggs with tortilla, people call it Huevos Rancheros :P)  Nevertheless, it was yummy and shakshouka- If you eat this plate with Tortilla, it could be similar to Huevos Rancheros.. Both of them were all yummy.  We also ordered Scones, it was super good!     The restroom was super clean. :) We sat outside so when I went inside to pay - Oh this place is Cash-Only, I saw a baby grand piano. I wondered if anyone plays it sometimes..   We will definitely go back!  Oh! Don't forget to ask for habanero spicy sauce when you order Shakshouka and Huevos Rancheros.  It was really good with it"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  You need to go here.   I came to Prohibition randomly for a late brunch with my cousin, and as usual, it did not disappoint. There's nothing more I can say that hasn't been said already. This place is simply phenomenal and gets it right every damn time, in food and in service.  Bulgarian benedict is amazing. Challah french toast and fried chicken are BANGIN'. With a Yelp check-in, I also got a scone (normally would be a cookie, but they had ran out and compensated for it).  Enough said."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour les oeufs bénédictines Au lieu du traditionnel muffin anglais, on retrouve des uf pochés, du yogourt à l'ail avec feta au chèvre et huile de paprika. baguette rôtie à côté. C'est vraiment bon."}
{"text":"We split the French Toast/Fried Chicken and Huevos Rancheros - both were excellent.  The fried chicken was absolutely perfect, crispy, well seasoned, moist, tender.  Great french toast as well, crispy on the outside, perfect balance of fluffiness and thickness on the inside.  Huevos rancheros were very good, but the highlight was the chicken & french toast.  Both service and ambiance were excellent, and very reasonable prices as well.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Love the specialty of the weekend brunch but i think they should add side of fruits to the orders."}
{"text":"The challah French toast with fried chicken is amazing...until you come back. I've been there three times already, always asking for the same plate because I loved it. Then I have felt disappointed by how the chicken has shrunk from one time to the next."}
{"text":"Yummy donutty French toast and fried chicken served with real maple syrup. Fluffy ricotta lemon flavoured pancakes with juicy thick slices of sweet bacon. These were the ingredients to an excellent breakfast.   Will definitely need to come back to try the Hungarian eggs Benny which seemed to be the most popular dish."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast/brunch. It's actually my favourite breakfast in town. Only reason they're getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because I went for dinner once and was unimpressed. That being said, it's still amazing for breakfast and I plan on sticking around for that."}
{"text":"Steak and frites... Never had better. The best pepper sauce I ever had ! Took some time but but very pleasant terrace experience."}
{"text":"Located on Monkland Avenue in NDG, Prohibition is a small restaurant with a simple decor and comfortable atmosphere.  The weekend brunch menu offers eight options - I went for the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote and sugar bacon. I was quite happy with my dish; the pancakes were small and not too thick, and had a lovely lemony flavour that was not overpowering. The blueberry compote had a slight tartness and wasn't too sweet - just the way I like it. The combination of lemon and blueberries meshed really well together, and the fluffiness of the pancakes was like a little stack of clouds :)  I'm not a meat eater, but I really enjoyed the sugar bacon; it was cut thickly, was not chewy, nor was it too sweet. In my opinion, perfection!   Judging by the numerous orders of maple fried challah french toast & fried chicken at my table, I'd say this one's a crowd pleaser. It looked REAL good, and the portion was HUGE - I've never seen French toast cut that thick before! Another popular dish was the Bulgarian Benedict, which I'm told had a bite of a bite to it.   Overall, a very pleasant dining experience. That said, the waitress kept coming up behind me or next to me, and manoeuvring around my head, which was a pain in the ass and a little lacking in class. I mean, I understand that it's a small space but there is such a thing as personal space."}
{"text":"Prohibition has a unique, delicious brunch that I highly recommend. If you are looking for something different from the standard eggs, toast, and hash browns, this place delivers. We were visiting Montreal for the weekend and this definitely ranked as one of the better meals we had.  I had the maple fried challah bread french toast with fried chicken. It was a delicious treat. My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote which was also incredibly tasty. I totally recommend stopping here for brunch."}
{"text":"It was delicious, a great breakfast place. The ambiance was also really good. It has a small menu but everything good can't really go wrong. Also the Grog breakfast drink is great option. A must try, also recommend heading with time to kill or making a reservation. It's small place so there is a wait time."}
{"text":"My father and I have this thing where we go to a different Montreal breakfast place more or less every two weeks. This time, we chose Prohibition for a late Father's Day father daughter breakfast and it was great. I had the Mexican breakfast dish and my father had the Bulgarian Benedict. At fist I thought my plate would not satiate me and my father felt his plate look a little boring but in the end both plates were delicious and filling. A must try for breakfast lovers."}
{"text":"This place has great food and vibe. The best challah French toast in town. Fried chicken is crispy and light. Overall a great sinful cheat meal...;)"}
{"text":"This is what's up:  It's a small breakfast/brunch/lunch place with good intentions. ... But it needs better service (don't ask paying customers to give up their chair when there's chairs used as coat racks 2 feet away). ... You should go here for the fried chicken & French toast, please avoid the huevos rancheros (blaaaand). ... It isn't cheap.  ... I wish I had ordered the fried chicken and French toast....."}
{"text":"Shoot, I should've gone for the french toast...  I went for the pancakes. They were COLD! But the french toast was warm. That small sample of chewy, carnival doughnut-ness I had off my friend's plate pretty much slaps me silly with diner's remorse. Ugh, the pancakes were small. It had a weird taste; was it the lemon component mixed with the maple syrup that was odd? Or the ricotta? I don't know.   Why, oh why did I get the pancakes! At least I didn't get the huevos rancheros like the guy sitting beside me, which didn't look filling at all.   A small note: being a vegetarian, you can request that the maple bacon or the fried chicken be substituted with fruit, even though it's not much of an 'equivalent'.   The service was fast (assuming you make reservations). Maybe a little too fast, as in the waiter hovered behind my friend and I as we were sucking on the last bits of our oranges."}
{"text":"I love this place because it is unique and doesn't just serve your bacon and eggs which honestly I am tired of having when I go out and pay good money!!!!  Granted I am bit peculiar and could not resist having fried chicken and waffles ( I know sounds terrible) but it was pretty good if you want to indulge.  I definitely recommend but go there early on weekends as it gets crowed"}
{"text":"OK, stop right there.  Not only did the owner catch me stealing recipes (or how I would put it, \"borrowing ideas\") but he offered up his contact information so we can continue to talk about business. This, is probably why this place is such a breath of fresh air, great food, and friendly staff.  It could use a little more room to expand as the seating is packed in pretty tight, but that was quickly forgotten about once I started sipping down my craft cocktail and smashing food into my face.  I went with the french toast and fried chicken. Chicken was moist and the outside perfectly crispy and the french toast done right - thick Challah bread grilled to perfection.  My friend ordered the petit pancakes with maple bacon. Legit!  This is a \"must revisit and become a regular\" type of place. And I'll be back.  5 stars all around"}
{"text":"This trendy little basement restaurant has a vibe all of its own. Its kind or vintage meets contemporary, hipster. The food is great I got the French toast as it was the house staple. I do how ever think they skimped out on the chicken though. One small thigh is all I got. I would have also preferred them to have fresh juice.  The service was great. But if you are going to go for brunch be ready to wait."}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE!! Original menu items!! Go there!! Just go! Just GO  And I'd say when you go, get the French toast and fried chicken, if he has it, the bourbon lemonade and a cafe mocha..."}
{"text":"Best scones ever in town Went with one of my best friends for Brunch, only problem is that now I want to fo back at least once a month to have those delicious scones that melts in your mouth If you love scones, you definitely need to go there!"}
{"text":"Première fois chez Prohibition. J'ai opté pour le \"Poulet frit et pain perdu\" - succulent et parfait pour ceux qui ont la dent sucrée (sans être TROP sucré), les meilleurs french toasts que j'ai mangés! Le hic: pas de patates ni de salade on the side. Service courtois et rapide.   Note: très achalandé le weekend, à venir tôt pour éviter la file!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah this was a hip brunch place. I had the chicken and waffles totally not common dish outside the southern US. Everything else was fine."}
{"text":"Brunch à la bar food style! At least that's what I ordered on their menu, the Pork Biscuit with fries. There's the poached egg with paprika and goat cheese, its good but they haven't gotten the ratio of crunchy toast to cottage cheese quite right. It's an extra $2 if you need more toast. It's a bit heavy as a meal for any time of the day but it does taste good! For those who want more breakfast material, their crepes look very appealing. They moved about 2 months ago from the small downstairs spot to a an upstairs locale one block down.  It's more spacious but still crowded. It's nice that on busy days they take down your number and call you when they're ready rather than have you wait. It's nice to be able to walk around Monkland while waiting.  It's definitely worth a visit. They have a different evening menu as well."}
{"text":"What a joke. Arriving we where told the kitchen was to busy for 30 min and we couldn't sit down and wait nor even order a coffee. I was floored and couldn't believe in a service business that an owner would have a policy that you couldn't even sit even though the place was half empty. After speaking to the rude staff the rude owner came with his miserable face stating his rules. I tried to explain we would wait but his lordship wouldn't have it. How could this idiot running a small business making brunch have an attitude like this. The food isn't even that good. I guess if you want a high caloric intake and be treated like dirt this dump is the place. There are 100 place better plus the staff and owner make you feel welcomed. Wouldn't eat here for free."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp and it is a very well deserved one. I had a great brunch at Prohibition. The service was very friendly, I didn't feel rushed, even though they were busy with their brunch madness. Our waiter was very personable and checked in with us frequently.   The food was amazing. I find breakfast / brunch food hard to get right without feeling like I could make it myself for less. This food was definitely decadent and worth it. I had the breakfast poutinen, the gravy was perfect and they were generous with the cheese. My egg was perfect on top and I wasn't able to finish the poutine, trust me I tried.    My mom had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which I tasted and they were fantastic. Moist and flavorful with some sugar bacon to go with it.   My husband had the fried chicken and challah bread French toast. So good. He said he would have it again for our next visit.   Overall, I think it's the best brunch option on Monkland."}
{"text":"Really good restaurant tucked away on Monkland in NDG. I went for brunch and had the omlette special which was stuffed with brie,  had red and green peppers,  mushrooms,  onions and paprika spice. It was served with fries which were home cut. The service was great,  friendly and I am told their dinner menu is quite good so I will be returning.    I can't justify 5 stars for any breakfast spot since (in general) there is not much to it but this place gets as close to 5 stars as you can get."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've ever had. Visited in May during a weekend trip on the recommendation of a friend, and after a long night of drinking, Prohibition's breakfast poutine brought me back to life. Great service, great food with unique twists, and interesting specials. Will definitely come back on my next trip and would gladly recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic if you are celiac or gluten intolerant.  Lots of their dishes are made to be gluten-free regardless.  For instance, you can't tell a difference with their pancakes, but they're safe for celiacs. No wheat flour!  Their mimosas were a little steep ($9 for a single) for someone who has done brunch in Brooklyn.  Clearly they make a lot of their cash off their alcohol menu.  My boyfriend got the shakshuka, which we are going to recreate at home because it looked absolutely fantastic.  He loved it!  The price point here is reasonable and the service is decent as well.  Come here with an empty belly and the expectation to be satisfied!"}
{"text":"Soooo good.  With the long wait. Came here for brunch on a quick trip to Montreal.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We clearly did not like our food (we were barely touching it) and the waiter was evidently avoiding to come see us - not once did he ask if everything was alright. Coffee was made out of an automatic machine - never would have ordered a latte had I known. Never going back."}
{"text":"A perfect destination the morning after enjoying Montreal's nightlife. Ordered the pancakes, fried chicken and French toast & breakfast pontine. Everything was amazing and the owner was a great guy. The bartender recommended a recovery cocktail that was delicious and needles to say we started drinking again. This is a must try when visiting Montreal!!  It's a few minutes by cab out of the city area."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food and hip location makes Prohibition one of my favorites in Montreal. I've had 3 meals here in the past two days and came away full and very satisfied with the overall experience. Also, they have a great drinks and cocktail menu also.    I can't say enough good things about Prohibition. Do yourself a huge favor and experience it for yourself.   I met the owner and must say he was very personable and remembered what we talked about the previous night. A+"}
{"text":"Food was okay, and menu selection's definitely very interesting, but lunch was not helped by burnt, flavorless fries. Slow service, extraordinarily long wait for bill at end."}
{"text":"Oh my god. I'm so glad I decided to make the trip down to NDG to try this place. Their brunch, from the one dish I had, was fantastic. I ordered the breakfast poutine, which had thin-cut French fries, soft and melty cheese curds, sweet and salty sugar bacon, some bits of crispy fried chicken, and a gravy that reminded me of the kind that you eat with biscuits. This was all topped with a perfectly-done fried egg whose yolk, when broken, mixed sublimely with the other components and made it even more delightful. Although it was so rich that I couldn't finish it all, it was well-worth the money spent, and I am so glad that I was able to temporarily die and go to heaven by eating this one dish."}
{"text":"Why does unhealthy food taste good and healthy food taste bad???  I don't know if it's like the whole forbidden fruit thing or what. Anyways, This is THE brunch spot in Montreal. Took me 45ish mins (by transit) to reach here from my place and it was TOTALLY WORTH it.  Be sure to make reservations coz it gets really crowded. I started with a coffee spiked with baileys & whiskey (just a FYI.... I'm not an Alcoholic). Great taste. The star of this place is definitely the French toast with fried chicken. Maple fried challah french toast, fried chicken, cinnamon sugar & maple syrup. The maple syrup is authentic & served in a tiny teeny bottle. Also the piece of fried chicken was small but delicious. (What is this, food for ants???) Now to the French Toast, 3 Humongous pieces of maple fried challa bread cooked to perfection. A bit crispy on the outside and soft inside. Orgasmically Delicious....OHHH YEAAAAAHHH. Worth a visit...... Again & Again  Food -  Awesome  Service - Friendly   Ambiance - Casual / Cozy Worth the money - Yes"}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch and no wait at the bar.  Bartender quickly served up coffee and informed us of the specials. It was hard to decide between all of the deliciousness but we went with the special - and being St. Patrick's Day it was an Irish stew in a puff pastry with eggs and 1/2 fried tomato on the side.  We also got the fried chicken & pain perdu (French toast en Français)& maple syrup. The servings were very generous and food was absolutely delicious.  Fried chicken was crisp and not too greasy, pain perdu soft and moist on the inside but crisp on the outside. The St. Paddy's day special was equally delicious and was able to taste the Jameson & Guiness braise used on the meat.  All in all a great way to end a lovely weekend à Montréal!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés au brunch, c'etait tres bien par contre le menu a l'air de changer donc certains plats que j'avais vus en photo n'etaient pas la :-(   Decors/ambiance: 4 etoile, la terrasse est superbe, mais en dedans c'est vraiment assourdissant.  Service: A1, on a attendu une vingtaine de minutes pour la terrasse et notre serveuse etait fort sympatique.  Nourriture: 4 etoiles, mes oeufs rancheros c'etait bon, mais pour 13$ j'aurais rajouté des fruits ou des patates. Si tu commandes juste ca, ca reste petit! Beau menu mais limite. Le repas de mon ami pain frit et poulet frit etait a se jetter parterre, meme si lourd sur l'estomac je prends ca la prochaine fois."}
{"text":"We came for dinner during a spring break trip to Montreal. It's a bit far out of the way from the city center, but it's not a terribly long trip from Berri-Ouam.   Overall, it was a good experience, with a friendly staff and great food. It was a little pricey, and service was a little slow, but overall a worthwhile trip (plus, all their beers are from Du Dieu Ciel, a major bonus)."}
{"text":"Just amazing! I went here on two occasions. Once for dinner and another time for breakfast. Both times were wonderful. I actually prefer dinner since it's less busy and I love the live performance.   For dinner I tried their 1/2 ribs, which were delectable, moist and delicious. I also love their homemade donuts and bloody ceaser. Just delicious!   For breakfast in tried the Israeli favorite, the shashouka. Just yum. I have a big appetite so next time I'm trying the prohibition.   Just try it out and be sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars lightly especially for breakfast but this was hands down the the best breakfast. Three of us went out. I ordered the lemon ricotta crepes, there was an order of the huevos rancheros and and order of the chicken and French toast. There was sharing all around and each dish was a hit. The lemon ricotta crepes were light and not too sweet, the sugar bacon was thick and crispy. The huevos rancheros was delicious, fresh pice de gallo and guac all served a top corn tortillas. The chicken and French toast was amazing. The deep fried crispiness of the French toast with the taste of cinnamon sugar is perfectly balanced. The crispy crunchy fried chicken was not too greasy or salty. We all left satisfied and stuffed."}
{"text":"Breakfast. If you are seriously serious about breakfast then read on. If you think breakfast is just another meal in a day, then you my friend definitely need to read on.  I like to think of myself as a serious sort of breakfast/bruncher meaning that I don't just go for toast and eggs and a coffee. When I go for brunch, I go for the whole 9 yards, because let's face it, I can make toast at home.  I like Prohibition so much that I went twice. In the same month, and I still dream about those french toast pieces. Not too sweet, not too cinammony but just perfect, and perfectly made.  Deboned chicken and spiced just right, and not too mention those seriously cute bottles of syrup.    My first time there I also went for the Huevos Rancheros, which I loved! Fresh cilantro, guac, sour cream, salsa, black beans on eggs on little slightly bigger than egg sized tortillas.   Thirdly, there were cookies, I am just going to say for the record, no we didn't need them with what we had, but we certainly were not going to say no. They come out warm, and I can tell that whoever made them, must like cookies, otherwise they weren't going to taste as amazing as that.   Ambience-wise, it is a tad smallish, in the sense that the tables were really close together, which is both good and bad. Good because you can see what other people ordered, bad because you can't help but stare at their food before yours came.   Next time I go, I am definitely going to try yet another breakfast plate, til I have tried them all. So before I end this post, breakfast lovers, get yourself together and get your breakfast on."}
{"text":"Had the homemade sausage on a biscuit with eggs.  I would recommend that you ask them without gravy as it was too soggy.   The scones are very tasty especially with the cream."}
{"text":"Happy to have found this gem on Yelp! First timers in Montreal. Great location. Warm inviting intimate ambience with delicious food and hearty cocktails. And great service from Carla. What else do you want?"}
{"text":"Holy delicious. My lord. Quasi religious experience. We were trying to have a semi-worky meeting but we needed to repeatedly sit in silence with our eyes half closed thinking about the miracle that is challah french toast with fried chicken... because this is like no french toast I've ever tried, more like giant light piece of challah dipped in donut batter and lightly fried to the consistency of funnel cake and or dreams. Perfect perfect perfect chicken breast. Tiny little bottle of syrup on the plate (who doesn't awww for teeny tiny glassware? people who are dead inside, probably.)   Clean simple comfortable decor in this unobtrusive semi-basement on Monkland. Very sweet and prompt staff, affordable prices that will have me journeying across town to brunch here often."}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch. The food is absolutely amazing. The Huevos Rancheros is the best I've had. You also can't go wrong with the challah french toast or the chicken and waffle. The maple bacon is thick and full of flavor. The only downside is the restaurant is very small so the wait times can be long since it's a popular restaurant (well deserved), but the upside is they're moving to a significantly larger location in the Fall. If you're in the area check it out."}
{"text":"Quoi de mieux que de commencer la journée avec un bon brunch, n'est ce pas ?! En compagnie de mes très chers amis, Geoffrey F. et Perrine J., vient le moment de faire notre choix, choix qui ne fut pas évident car tout était tentant et semblait appétissant ! On arrivait à peine à se décider et pourtant, comparé à d'autre endroits, le choix est assez restreint (ce qui est mieux pour les indécis de la vie tout comme moi). Donc, petit coup de pousse de la part du serveur qui nous conseille les 3 meilleurs plats selon lui et merci ! Pour ma part, ce fut  le fameux \"Challah French Toast and fried chicken\", et c'était vraiment très bon, je ne pouvais plus m'arrêter ! Je dirais que c'est une espèce de gros pain perdu légèrement frit (bon, on est d'accord on oublie les calories à ce moment là) et le tout avec sirop d'érable bien sûr ! Le poulet, rien a dire, il était bon et tendre !   Ce qui fait la différence avec Prohibation Montreal, c'est qu'ils nous offrent un choix de plats différents, autrement dit, ça change du traditionnel: pancakes, bacon, pommes de terre, etc... (même si j'adore ça aussi). Ici, ils apportent une petite touche un peu plus raffiné tel que le pancake au citron et ricotta, entre autre, pris par Perrine, j'ai testé et je le recommande également, tout comme les oeufs bénédictines !  L'ambiance y est agréable, le cadre est un peu style bar, on n'a même pas l'impression qu'il est 11h du matin. Les serveurs sont vraiment sympas et de bons conseils. Et les prix abordables !   Petit bémol : Il est plus que préférable de réserver !   Bref, on y retourne le week-end prochain ?! :D"}
{"text":"Visited in August 2016 for brunch because I heard they had a dish called Bulgarian Benedict. I was immediately intrigued as I am Bulgarian. It is made of poached eggs over a bed of yogurt, feta and cooked paprika in oil with toasted baguettes. Needless to say it was authentic and incredibly delicious, brought me straight back to my childhood! We also tried the fried chicken and waffles and that was delicious as well. I would come back here over and over if I could! I am sorry to see it is closed? I hope that it opens up again or that it was reported closed by mistake!"}
{"text":"You'll be delighted with the excellent and friendly service at this neighborhood eatery.  I am leaving three stars because my last experience was not up to their usual standards of quality and there were a few minor issues with the meal which lead me to believe that the kitchen was understaffed."}
{"text":"I had the pancakes, lovely!  Portion was small though.  The waffle and fried chicken was way too greasy, I have no idea why people love it."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite meals during my visit to Montréal. Highlight was definitely the poutine fritters, but my soup and braised beef was also delicious. Finished off with fried chocolate chip cookie dough, which was phenomenal.   The service was great; we had a really lovely time here. I will definitely come back and make sure I recommend it to any of my friends headed to Montréal!"}
{"text":"Challah bread french toast is as amazing as its reputation! That thing is crazy good, and the comparisons to funnel cake are spot on. If the French toast was the only thing on my plate, hands down this review would be 5 stars. THE HYPE IS REAL.   Next to the French toast were 2 pieces of fried chicken and that's where this dish lost me. I think I caught these guys on a bad day because my chicken was not on its A-game. My pieces were much too dark and heavy which I suspect is due to a lack of oil change but I can't say for certain. It could've been overcooked too. The skin, typically the best part, didn't separate from the chicken and felt caked on. The batters' spices were not pleasant either - I had awful breath for the rest of the day.  The fruit on my plate made me laugh. I get it. Big weekend rush ahead, must ration! ....but half a grape?! A slice of orange? Am I at Cora?  All in all, I'm happy I tried it but I wouldn't take the fried chicken again. I'd probably ask for more French toast. My friends' dishes were all really good; they had the breakfast poutine, the biscuit sandwich and the ricotta pancakes. The pancakes made me drool a little bit.   Oh and the other half of my grape was in my buddies plate, in case you were wondering."}
{"text":"Super friendly busy little joint.  Had an amazing brunch. Really great service and all the dishes we ordered were  a) a bit odd and  b) delicious.   The Shakshuka was my personal stand-out favourite. I could eat that every morning. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Phenomenal brunch. The French toast is outta this world, and the fried chicken is tasty and not too oily at all. Perfect spot!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in Montreal, I eat here as the food is delicious! I've had numerous things on the menu and it's so amazing that I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice place that typical Monkland Village Cafe food is good and the staff is very polite enjoy for students gatherings or other couples and Grannys!!"}
{"text":"Profiter de la terrasse si possible.  Tout simplement débile comme place pour aller déjeuner. Le service était parfait et la nourriture excellente même si le menu semble étrange par ses combinaisons. Oubliez votre régime le temps d'un repas, car la vie est trop courte pour se priver de manger au moins une fois dans ce restaurant. En été, je vous conseille fortement la terrasse, car je trouve l'intérieur un peu étourdissant (avis personnel). Bref, une chance qu'il y avait les boutiques autour pour me permettre de marche et de digérer me déjeuner hautement calorique. À vous de découvrir ce restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited Prohibition with my lovely boyfriend on Easter brunch. Let me start off by admitting how hard it is for me to find a good brunch spot as my man hates brunch. I was putting a lot of hope in this place since I knew by looking up the menu before going that it was more than your regular fare. Happy to say I wasn't disappointed!!! Everything looked and tasted delicious. We ordered the challah & fried chicken and the huevos rancheros. I was surprised at how moist the chicken was and how my cup of coffee was always being refilled.   Although the food was great and the prices were fair (avg. $14/plate on the menu including coffee) I gave this 4 stars because the serving size were irregular. Let me explain, my plate had 2 pieces of fried chicken and 3 gigantic slices of challah French toast while the boyfriend's plate looked small in comparison. Same thing for the pancake plate on the table next to me, relatively small compared to my huge portion. We actually ended up splitting my plate in half because I couldn't eat it all and the huevos rancheros left my man hungry. If you have a big appetite, maybe get something else or a side order."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch food and not that long of a wait! I came here on a Saturday morning and the wait was only about 20 minutes or so for seating for 2. It's not a huge restaurant, but it seats around 30-40 which is a good amount of people, including the bar area. Some might feel it's a bit cramped, but everyone around was very friendly and understood the circumstances. The service was good as they serve you immediately once you sit down and are right on top of things.   I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich with the French Fries while my girlfriend ordered the Maple French Toast with Fried Chicken. The food was SO DELICIOUS! The breakfast sandwich was an egg muffin with ham and a fried egg and I'm not usually a big fan of egg muffins, but this one was truly delicious! It absolutely destroyed the ones I eat at McDonald's! The fried chicken with the french toast was drenched with maple syrup. The fried chicken was crunchy on the outside and very juicy on the inside. The addition of the syrup added a touch of sweetness, which was the perfect balance.  Prohibition Montreal is only a short Metro ride away from downtown and it's a nice walk thru a residential neighborhood. Absolutely worth the small trip!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh great brunch place in Montreal!! Let's start with checking in for a free pretzel cookie or coffee.  A must is the fried chicken with waffle!!!!!! The bread was perfect.. so fluffy, soft and moist. The chicken was also cooked perfectly with the batter, with a perfect sweetness added.  Bulgarian Benedict was very interesting, good flavors! My friend also had the Huevos Rancheros which I would recommend ordering something else since it was nothing special."}
{"text":"Let me start by using a simple but powerful word: mouthgasm. Followed by: Poutine dejeuner. One of my favourite brunch places in the city,they also serve dinner & lunch on Fridays only which I haven't been to yet. Having just moved to this area,I was looking for a restaurant I could walk to,have a cocktail before noon & eat my heart out.   They have a lovely terrasse when the weather permits which reduces the wait time substantially. Well decorated but crammed when it's busy,first world problems. So far,all of the staff have been vigilant,helpful & amicable. They do not take reservations for brunch however,you can put your name on the list,go window shopping on Monkland & they call you 5 minutes before your table is ready.  I've tried a different dish almost every time. The challah french toast & fried chicken are all they promise to be. Filling & a great balance of sweet & savoury,they serve it with real maple syrup. Do it. The lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote & sugar bacon is breathtaking,the bacon has got to be the thickest bacon I've ever eaten in a restaurant anywhere. Get a side of it if you really want to indulge.   As much as I love poutine,I would never of thought I would be one of those people who would have it for breakfast so I surprised myself when the 2 blessed words flew out of my mouth on a Sunday at 10:00am. Fries,small pieces of their fried chicken,sugar bacon,gravy,cheese curds & an over easy egg. It's the perfect recipe for a hang over cure or if you want almost everything off the menu. Treat yo' self people.  The scones & pastries are made fresh & are different every day,I have not tried them but they did seem appetizing. Coffee or tea comes with all brunch dishes. The cocktail I had was powerful,beware. I had a peach something,I can't remember the name,I'll get back to you on it. They also offer a special of the day on food & booze so you can get creative & switch things up.  I was curious as to the reason they named the resto prohibition & here it is: 1) The owner loves that era 2) It took them over 2 years to get the license to serve alcohol (oh QC bureaucracy!)  Give it a try,you won't be disappointed & you might leave with a side of bacon."}
{"text":"As per dictionary.com, Prohibition: a law or decree that forbids  Well, let me say this in one shot: there ain't no flavor on prohibition at Prohibition!  Fried challah french toast topped with cinnamon sugar??? INGENIOUS!!! I can't believe how soft the challah bread was on the inside. Yet the outside was just the right amount of crisp and guess what? Not that much oil! And the fried chicken? Plus 1 for NO BONES and plus 1 for SUCCULENT DARK MEAT! Need I say more? And again, not overguzzing with the oil. The seasoning had a slight kick of spice to it, which was a sha-bam for my mouth. I've heard of waffles & fried chicken many times but fried french toast & chicken?!?! *angels sing* AHEM.  Prohibition has a rustic feel to it and average noise ambiance. It's a great place for brunch, whether it's with a friend, significant other or group of friends. And there's definitely no doubt on the flavor - the chefs Prohibition knows how to pack it in! Staff is also superb - friendly and humble.  If you're visiting Montreal like I was, you MUST come here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, amazing service. Will be back most certainly. Counting down the days!"}
{"text":"I soooo love this place for breakfast.  Original, chock full of flavor, unique and delicious.  If you haven't had breakfast here yet, you don't know what you are missing.   We showed up a group of four and managed to catch a table outside.  We were all so curious about every dish, we all ended up ordering something different and played musical plates with our dishes.  Even the jar of Greek yogurt was a freaking hit.... so tasty... so good.    Don't miss this one next time you are looking for something different for breaky, it will win your taste buds and your heart."}
{"text":"The dishes were unique and exquisite. Perfect brunch place for any day of the week. The fried chicken and french toast is amazing, and the same goes for the avocado toast. There are weekend specials that change from week to week. Incredibly enticing for us to come back. :)"}
{"text":"One of the better brunch spots in MTL. I would avoid the ouevos rancheros, but other than that you can't go wrong. Good vibes. I'd go in. 4-man or less group. Anything more and you may be waiting a little while."}
{"text":"Beautiful new location on Monkland Ave. Loving the new menu too. The dinner options are as awesome as are the brunch ones. Always creative and always delicious! I had the PEI moules et frites as a main and the fried chocolate chip cookie dough for dessert...Holy sweet explosion of goodness in my mouth. Service was great as usual, very attentive. Have I mentioned how much their cocktails kick ass? Well, they do. I'm a big fan of their wine selection too. You're in for a fun and tasty culinary experience."}
{"text":"This place is good. Real good.  We arrived at a busy time (12pm on a Sunday) and the hostess told us when to come back for our table and it was ready right on time (we didn't have a reservation, but you can and should reserve when you come).  The men at the table had the fried chicken and french toast, and it was a winner winner. The chicken has been de-boned and fried nicely (just once - not chicken fried). The french toast is HUUUGE, and comes with a small bottle of maple syrup for your drowning pleasure.  The ladies present had some of the savoury dishes. I don't exactly remember. Something girly. They smiled and looked pretty, so it must've been pretty good too.  The place is new, and nicely done up. I see wine fridges and beer glasses, so I hope they get a liquor license soon.  The meals came out to about $30 per couple, which for the quality of food is fantastic value! Definitely worth the wait if you're in the area. I know I will be going back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, it's a small menu but everything is just so good and not crazy expensive. The place is a little small and your sitting very close to the table next to you. The staff is friendly and relatively attentive, The Hevos Rancheros is really good, and you need to try their scones with home made jam, they run out often because there just so good!! get em while you can :)"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed this morning. I used to come here all the time. The gravlax dish used to be served with a tomato salad and a bagel and it was a nice generous portion. This time it was a tiny bit of salmon with three pieces of lettuce, 5 tiny capers and four sad, thin pieces of baguette. For a $15 brunch, the plate was embarrassing. My friend who had the lemon ricotta pancakes (4 bite-sized) also was starving after. We literally went to go have another meal after. (We are two slender girls and we were not even close to full.) the waitress should warn the customers when they're ordering an appetizer-sized meal for brunch...."}
{"text":"Short but very interesting brunch menu. Bulgarian Benny was very garlicy and delicious. Loved it. Although it is quite heavy, it is worth it."}
{"text":"We went to Prohibition for a very nice dinner after seeing online that they take customers with celiac disease seriously.  We called ahead to be sure they could accommodate a gluten-free diner, and not only did they say yes, but they also reached back out to us to advise that although they normally have more options available, they only had one tonight. When we decided to keep the table, we got there and found out that they'd altered another item on their menu to be gluten free so that my partner could have more than one main dish to choose from.  This is a big deal. Montreal is still sadly about 10 years behind where it needs to be on accommodation of celiac diners and attention to detail about allergens in general, and it was refreshing to find a place that not only gets it but bent over backwards to make their menu work for us.  Dinner was very nice. Everything was fresh, well seasoned, and attractively presented. A good selection of wine, beer, and desserts was also available.  Service was attentive and friendly but never intrusive. Even the young man on the piano at the door playing a smile-worthy playlist of the best of Taylor Swift was a nice touch.  More restaurants in Montreal should be doing what Prohibition is doing. We're glad we found it."}
{"text":"My coworker and I split the Kale salad to start and it was delicious and fresh as was the complimentary bread at the start of the meal.   He had the daily special which was the roti with plantain and it was lovely! Seasoned perfectly with a bit of a kick to it and the meat was very tender. I had the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was delicious and cooked really well but the waffles I found to be too heavy and oily. I couldn't even finish my meal because it was all very heavy and deep fried (which was expected) but still a bit too much for me.   The service was friendly and attentive. Worth the visit and I do hope the roti special becomes a menu item, I would definitely return for that and the kale salad."}
{"text":"One of the breakfast places that's take reservations. Small place nice ambiance. I didn't love my experience only because my coffee was horrible. I ordered the huevos rancheros and the corn tortilla was stale. They also don't modify their dishes. ( I had asked that the egg be poached instead of fried) my friend had the Bulgarian Benedict which she loved. It seems popular just not for me."}
{"text":"A party of 4 (1 infant) entered this legendary breakfast place during a Sunday morning to embark on a journey of marvels that was prophesied by \"The Great Yelp\".  The party approached the entrance of the cave known only as \"Prohibition Montreal\" and decided to ask the indifferent gatekeeper if they can stay for awhile and order from this lovely small place.   The key word being... \"indifferent\", who felt it was \"OK\" to let people stand there waiting for 30 minutes to get seats while several seats were left available in the physical sense for MINUTES, while she ran around trying to find the people she knew, who prior to our visit, put their names down but weren't willing to wait to sit down and were hanging out a few stores down. Those minutes that went by? Yeah, customers should be filling those seats quickly so that the next client can be seated and avoid standing there for 30 minutes while holding a baby seat. But hey, that's how things run here during prime-time Sundays.  When we eventually got seats, we suddenly realized how small this place is. With barely any room to sit in the middle of the tightly packed restoraunt, I had to position myself where less amount of foot traffic was happenin  so that no one would knock over the baby seat while my wife and friend repeatedly got their seat bumped during their meal by other clients and staff. Also staff, I know you have nowhere to go but do you mind giving us our personal space?  I ordered a latte, which sadly I couldn't get for free due to the Yelp freebie no longer being applicable for checking-in. Sadly, the latte was very average and already came luke-warm. I've had far better. Great start.  I ordered the challah french toast with fried chicken because why the hell, why live to 40?   The Yelpers who recommended this were absolutely correct. The french toast was something unique and along with some fried chicken they really managed to compliment each other. I truly enjoyed this meal and crave to taste it again. The maple syrup was authentic, so kudos to that as well.  Sadly, we collectively wished we were seated on the banquets as the middle seating was very uncomfortable and thus the food was consumed quickly so that we could leave quickly.  The service in general was slow with a noteworthy delay on receiving our bills. Or maybe it was wanted to get out as quickly as possible due to the poor seating.  The price tag was decently priced.  All in all, it was an OK experience. The food was great, the latte was bad, the service could have been far better and the seating arrangement atrocious even without dealing with a baby seat.   I might come back one day but not anytime soon particularly during prime-time."}
{"text":"Oh, yes!! The blueberry-lemon pancakes are amazing and served with a slice of this incredible canadian bacon I could eat everyday. The gravlax with bagel is perrrerfect!! If you're feeling funky, go for the fried chicken and challah french toast. Too bad it's a bit far from downtown because they're s grest way to start a Sunday!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best meal we have had in Montreal thus far! And the best French toast I have had.... basically ever. Its fried and served with fried chicken! Insanely delicious and worth every penny. The service is wonderful as well, and so is the coffee."}
{"text":"Had such a yummy brunch. Definitely plan on coming back. Those pancakes are incredible. Love the atmosphere and service was great too."}
{"text":"While they are now open for Dinner, I think they should stick to Brunch/Breakfast.  We started with the Salmon gravlax on a crostini with a dill cream cheese spread.  The salmon did not taste fresh and the crostini was stale.  For dinner, I had the Jambalaya.  Not very exciting.  The shrimp looked small and sad.  My companion had the steak frites which was lukewarm.  Overall, I was alittle disappointed.    Will stick to their brunch menu only now which I remembered was very good."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Prohibition but since I rarely find myself in NDG I only recently checked it out.  The only regret I have is not trying this restaurant sooner.  They take classic brunch food and take it up a notch.  I opted for the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote.  They came with a side of candied bacon.  Also this was a minor detail but the size of the pancakes was all over the place.   Some were small while others were large.  I have to admit that I found it kind of odd.  The pancakes were fluffy though and the lemon and blueberry balanced each other quite well.    I am docking a star because the service was a little slow.  We did have a bit of a wait before we finally got our food.  Apart from that though I did enjoy it here and would want to come back to try more of their items."}
{"text":"Promiscuité assurée mais on ne s'en fait pas, l'ambiance est bonne et le service est courtois. Sinon, commandez un divin Lucy Goosey, composé entre autres de Prosecco. C'est fruité, léger, juste ce qu'il faut d'enivrant et ça démarre bien un brunch avec des amis. Tout comme moi, vous pouvez le savourer au bar en attendant lesdits amis.   Trêve de Lucy. Côté bouffe, j'ai opté pour le poulet frit accompagné de pain doré. Un peu déçue par la volaille fade dont l'enrobage était trop grillé à mon goût. Le poulet  doit mariner avant d'être frit pour s'imprégner de sel et autres arômes. Sinon, on n'obtient un résultat mitigé. Dommage, moi qui ferais des kilomètres pour ce plat... !   Quant à lui, le pain doré était correct. Mes amis ont, entre autres, opté pour la shakshouka et le bénédicte bulgare et ont bien apprécié.   Je retournerai sans doute essayer un de ces cocktails tous aussi attrayants les uns que les autres. Et d'autres plats."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived approx 1:05pm Sunday afternoon.  My first to PM and found it quite small a little loud but cozy atmosphere . We were seated and given menus, 15 mins later when finally attended to and ready to order we were told those to dishes we wanted weren't available sold out...we couldn't have been informed we were given the menu? Strike one! ...then another 10 mins past before we able to gave our order we both ordered the Challah French Toast & Fried Chicken. The restaurant was 1/2 empty at this time and one person came in about 10mins after we ordered.... They order the same plate we did and received his meal before ours!!! Strike 2!! We called the waiter over and brought that politely to his attention, he apologized profusely and said it was a computer glitch... Ok new excuse to me lol..... Long story short.... We received our meal 1hr and 20mins after we walked in Strike 3!!!....only reason we stayed is 1) we were famished 2) other people next to us were complementing the food.  The meal was excellent above my expectation, the waiter was super polite and apologetic for everything above and beyond that's the only reason I gave any stars at all...... But would I go back? Never!!!  Due to everything if I owned PM or managed it, I'd make sure 1 meal was a freebie as an apologetic gesture. They definitely would have seen me back at that gesture."}
{"text":"Plats vraiment originaux et savoureux! Difficile à décrire mais une belle experience pour les papilles...il ya une Twist à chaque plat soit par le choix des des épices, soit par le mélange d'ingrédients inattendues. Gens à la diète s'obtenir! Le bacon est à se pitcher sur les murs et l'uf Benny mon coup de cur. La Poutine déjeuner un peu trop lourde pour moi mais cochonne à souhait si vous êtes en déficit de calories/ vous venez de faire votre meilleure course à vie or simply busted your moves on the dance floor all night. Je ne suis pas une Big Fan de poulet frit alors je ne commente pas mais pour les amateurs il semble que le leur soit spectaculaire.  The quality of staff for me Is as important as the quality of food and here there is a match! Friendly funny knowledgable  helpful ( I always want everything at once and have a hard time choosing) staff. The place is small and popular and if it's cold outside the door will bring its drift but lucky me We managed to sit in a warm spot.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Was looking for a great brunch place and found it. This place has hands down the best French toast I've ever had. Never have I had crunch French toast that was also chewy and seemed to be cooked just right. This place managed to do it, and for that they have the crown.   The actual meal was dried chicken and French toast as opposed to the usual waffles. My only qualm was that the piece of fried chicken they gave me was so small it was almost a bit ridiculous... Other than that, the meal was delicious and the service was great. Very friendly staff. We got there at 2:30 and there was no line, but I hear if you come during earlier hours (10-12) it's jammed packed and you'll be waiting a long time. However, I can say that it's absolutely worth the wait.  Thumbs up! Ill certain be back."}
{"text":"Was ere today for Brunch with my girlfriend. The food was very good, ad the price was very reasonable.   If I had one thing to say would be I waited quite a while for my bill after the table was cleared a good 10 minutes. Excusable because the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Les déjeuners sont juste TROP bons. J'ai essaye 4 repas dans le menu. Tous très délicieux! A essayé à tout prix chicken & waffle. Explosion de saveurs dans la bouche."}
{"text":"Great brunch on Sunday highly recommend it, atmosphere is loud but it's a great place to take your family or meet friends.  Try to get there before 11 and make a reservation to avoid waiting.  The service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Had brunch here with my girlfriends. We sat outside. I had the breakfast poutine. Pure heaven, everything anyone would want to eat all in one dish. Also tried a few of the cocktails and they were great! I cant wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Same Song and Dance      There really isn't much more to say about Prohibition that hasn't already been said(especially by Clare;). Fresh ingredients, prepared properly, with a little bit of their own spin, served promptly and courteously. All the makings of a good restaurant.       Griffintown used to be my go-to for breakfast, prior to the ownership change. Prohibition now tops that list, despite the fact that they have no alcohol.    That is a big deal, people.  Waka Waka"}
{"text":"C'est un peu decu que nous sommes sortis du Prohibition. Les plats y sont certes bons mais cela manque un peu... de quelque chose. Les assiettes sont assez peu garnis pour le prix finalement : 2 grains de raisin, un quart d'orange et pas une feuille de salade, portion un peu petite. Bref pas un coup de coeur. Dommage pour moi :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. We got to the area a little past 10pm and yelped nearby food spots, and this was one of the few still open. So happy they were, because they have yummy food. The staff was incredibly friendly with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. I had the Kale salad and baked brie - both were excellent. We then went back for brunch and my friends ordered the maple fried challah french toast. fried chicken. I took a bite of their french toast and it was UH - MAZING. Deep fried french toast - I have no words to even describe how good this was.  It was a shame that the French toast wasn't offered as a part of a vegetarian meal because I ordered the huevos rancheros, which were okay, nothing spectacular.  They had a live piano player, but even better than that, they played Hozier, along with other good music, but, I mean ..  Hozier. Definitely worth a trip to this place!"}
{"text":"For my forth time eating at Prohibition, I decided to go with their breakfast poutine, but before I get to that let me say a word or two about their brunch. It's super popular, they don't take reservations, so get there early. I've always had luck getting a table, though I've only been seated right away two out of my four visits, including today (we arrived at 10:45 AM).  The service has always been great. Actually, the host (owner?) held open the doors for us and seated us at the last available table for four and took our orders immediately.   Onto the breakfast poutine, a bowl of fries decorated with the standards - fries, cheese and gravy - along with the winning ingredient, fried chicken balls, topped with a fried egg.  It's a pretty intense breakfast. The chicken was so good I'd honestly order a bucket of it for take away. I'd have preferred more gravy, but I think I'm knit picking here.   At this point, I must have tried most of the menu and I'm hard pressed what is my favourite. It depends on your mood, but the French toast and Benedict are both winners in my book."}
{"text":"Laura D a raison de donner 5 étoiles à ce parfait refuge pour le brunch. C'est à 100% à cause de son avis que je m'y suis retrouvée avec mes amis pour un brunch du dimanche qui sort vraiment de l'ordinaire. Ici, il n'y a pas de deux-oeufs-bacon-patates. Ici c'est un pain perdu avec du poulet frit, ou des crêpes au ricotta, citron et bleuets, ou encore les oeufs bénédictines bulgares. De mon côté, c'est le shakshouka qui a attiré mon attention et rempli mon estomac. C'est une espèce de petite casserole d'oeufs cuits au four avec une sauce aux tomates et fromage ricotta servie avec des tranches croustillantes de pain pita frais. Ceux qui ont la dent salée seront comblés. J'ai aussi eu la chance de goûter au fameux pain doré et c'est vrai que ça goûte comme un beignet frit et glacé, à la Krispy Cream! La seule chose qui semblait manquer, surtout vu le nom du resto et les verres de vins derrière le bar, est une liste de cocktails de style mimosa ou Hair of the Dog pour compléter leurs brunchs décadents. C'est vraiment la nouvelle place à découvrir dans NDG donc faites vos réservations en avance ou bien arrivez très tôt car c'est aussi très petit."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place in Montreal. We couldn't have asked for a better meal. Came in for the candy bacon and it didn't disappoint- probably the best bacon we have ever had and everything else we ordered was just as good. The owner was super accommodating And gave us The wireless password to use while we were there which saved our lives as we are Americans in Montreal on vacation with terrible cell service. Thanks for everything!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group and I am starting to think that perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, because my breakfast was tiny and nothing to write home about. I ordered the pancakes and although they were good, there was absolutely nothing noteworthy about them. My latte was probably one of the worst lattes I have ever had, but it was free with check-in, so I won't complain too much about it. The service was really slow and the cheques took forever to arrive.  I would have given the place 4 stars based on food and ambiance, but near the end of our breakfast, the server came over and asked for one of our party to please give up the chair he was on as it belonged to a now occupied table...That's fair enough, I would have been fine with it, except there were 3 women at tables beside us that each took up a chair for their precious West Island handbags...could she not have used one of those chairs instead of taking one from a guy with a mouthful of challah French toast instead??"}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for brunch spots to try out. While I tend to focus on places in the Plateau and Mile End districts (mostly because I live nearby which is convenient on lazy weekends), every once in a while I will hear of a place for which I am willing to go a little further. Jason from Shut Up and Eat provided me with this gem with one of his most recent posts. As such, I hightailed it to NDG with my brunch buddy to go visit Prohibition.  This small restaurant sticks to a one page focused menu that has eclectic brunch fare. I started with the triple chocolate pretzel cookie because....well why not? Rich and gooey, just a delicious cookie. The pretzel pieces were not as plentiful as I expected but the mix of chocolates offset that nicely.  My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote and sugar bacon. The pancakes were nice and fluffy with a very strong note of lemon. I didn't expect the lemon to come out that strongly in the batter. Truly a pleasant surprise. The blueberry compote added the right level of sweetness to the dishes - maple syrup not required but still utilized. The sugar bacon was very nice as well - big thick cut bacon that is crispy and sweet at the same time.  I ordered the Challah french toast and fried chicken combo. A wonderful play on the southern classic chicken and waffles. The Challah french toast brought forth a wonderful sweet and crisp exterior with a light and fluffy interior. Honestly one of the French toast plates I've ever had. The fried chicken was very well done as well. Two requirements come to mind with fried chicken. First, the batter must be seasoned properly and crispy. Second, the chicken must remain juicy. Dryness is not an option. Both requirements were nailed here. This was very good chicken which a nice balance to the sweetness of the French toast. It is a pretty heavy dish by the usual breakfast and brunch standard, so if you like a lighter meal, avoid this combo but for everyone else, you will love it.  Prohibition certainly brought to the table some great brunch dishes that veered away from the standard breakfast and brunch fare. The price is reasonable all things considered and unlike a lot of places nowadays, the coffee and tea is included in the meal. If you are a party larger than 2, you may end up waiting in weekends as the place is not very big but regardless, Prohibition is certainly worth a look for any brunch seeking individuals.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken and french toast. You need to try it. It's a perfect combination of sweet and salty. The french toast was good, it's thicker then normal which is unique but some parts of it were a bit hard. The chicken however was amazing. It was so juicy and tender. I never think to eat fried chicken first thing in the morning but do it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great place! I like their decor and the ambiance a lot. The food was delicious, I had the fried chicken with purée and veggies. The chicken was perfect, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Also had the fried calamari, although it wasn't the best I've ever had, still quite good.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming, I'm going back for sure. Definitely recommended."}
