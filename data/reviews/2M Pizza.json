{"text":"After getting to Montreal and checking into my hotel, I decided to order some food before going to sleep. I asked the front desk what was available, and they told me about this place. I decided that a burger would do, so I went with that. I also ordered a poutine and some orange juice. The order came in less than half an hour, and it was delivered straight to my hotel room. The delivery person was nice, and we chatted a bit as I paid for my order. Afterward, I went to chow down. The burger was ok, it was nothing over the top but not bad either. The poutine was ok as well, the cheese on top tasted fine but the sauce was not too good. The orange juice was great, it was actual juice and not high-fructose corn syrup. The negative was the stomach ache that came after. I expected the food to settle better in my stomach, as food in Canada is prone to have no fillers/preservatives. But that is what happens when I order such food late at night. Oh well."}
{"text":"Ok pizzaria in Dorval if you like a wimpy pizza, their dressing is very decent and flavor wise its eatable. They also habe pretty good prices compared to others in the area."}
{"text":"Just an update-  These people have become family to us.  They are honestly so sweet, AND in my last review, I mentioned one woman who worked there who always messed our order up and made the food incorrectly... she has since been let go.  There is never a time where I worry about the quality of their food anymore.  Favorite place for fast food- hands down."}
{"text":"We just ordered 2 medium pizza, both were good normal styled pizza's. I was expecting a bit more after reading the revues so I am a bit disappointed. I have not tried anything else but looking at the menu they have many other options and I will be trying something else. I might update my review after trying something else."}
{"text":"Great service from the staff, the thing about this place is you get good food at reasonable prices. Their pizzas, burgers, poutines, etc, are nothing to rave about but aren't bad either. Good, decent food at reasonable prices, and a nice friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Highly recommend the Lachine and the Mexican.   The wings though were terrible though."}
{"text":"We had the fried chicken with French fries and it was delicious! The chicken was crispy and flavorful. French fries also very crunchy but not hard. We ordered delivery and even though it took them about 30-40 mins, the food arrived super hot! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Pizza toujours très bonne service numéro 1  La livraison toujours eu les chose que jai commande  Le cheeseburger trop bon  Les frites très bonne   Beaucoup choix de pizza  Et plusieurs autres choix"}
