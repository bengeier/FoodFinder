{"text":"Love Geos Taco. Owner is real awesome dude and the tacos are fantastic. Make sure you give this guy your business for events or bday parties"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how great Geo's Tacos are.  I was given Geo's number by a friend and contacted him to cater an outdoor party of 30 people.  He showed up early, and he was super professional and engaging with the guests at the party.  The food was very fresh, tasted amazing, and portions were plentiful.  Despite my hungry friends trying their best to eat everything Geo made, I still had food left over for about a week.  Will definitely use him again!"}
{"text":"Geo was catering an event we attended last week. These tacos were bomb dot com! We had 3 options to choose from: Beef, Chicken, and veggie (or you could get wild and have him serve all three on a taco). My favorite was the chicken, but all tasted great! Everyone was satisfied with the food and portions. Geo brought all the condiments which were fresh and the options were plentiful. There were three different salsa's, all which brought different levels of heat, but delicious. The food was served quickly. Geo was even accommodating to our special request of cheese taco shell (which I highly recommend). Would definitely recommend him to cater your next event!!"}

{"text":"These are, quite possibly, the best tacos in the world. As a tacophile I can honestly say that I've had a fair share of tacos in my life. The surprise I had was insurmountable when I realized that I had just eaten the best taco I have ever had in my life - and I'm an extremely picky eater.  The depth of flavor and the finish on the palette was as close to nirvana as a person can get in this world. Every single taco was made with love, and to impress; and it did!  Thank you Geo for such a wonderful gastronomical experience!"}
{"text":"I would totally recommend Geo's tacos! When we first reached out to him, he was so nice and quick to respond with any questions we had.  The price was great and fed our entire office and production line.  He had a great set up and so many options. Not only was the food delicious but he and his team were so nice. They even let us keep the leftovers!   We will definitely booking them again!"}
{"text":"Geo made booking the event so easy and the pricing was also easy to understand. They followed up prior to the event and showed up a few minutes earlier than scheduled. I was throwing a surprise party for my wife and they didn't mind parking away so she wouldn't see the truck. Not to mention the food was so delicious! They even let us keep the leftovers. I will definitely use them again and refer them to all my friends. Thanks Geo and team!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for at-home parties.  Geo was amazing, courteous, timely and everything in between.  I highly recommend him.  Everyone enjoyed the food and there were plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"We used Geo for catering for an event we were hosting. I have to say, I have never interacted with a more kind caterer. He was very professional, and quick at responding, literally within a minute or two of my text, even if it were at 8am.   He showed up early to set up, even brought materials to ensure oil did not leak on the ground (super considerate!). He was a pleasure to work with, always ensuring guests had whatever they needed and was quick to  serve food.   We did the tacos and quesadillas, which were delicious! The condiments were fresh, and some were definitely very spicy! I would HIGHLY recommend him for events, and we're trying to figure out which event we can have next to bring him out again."}
{"text":"Geo's Tacos catered my Mom's 80th Birthday a few weeks ago the food was amazing. My Family is still talking about those tacos were so good."}
{"text":"The gentlemen arrived on time, set up quickly and served my 50+ guest quickly. The food was excellent. Called to add rice at the last minute...so glad I did. It was deliciously flavored. I had left it off because I personally do not like rice. I loved it!!! We had the quesadillas too which were also great. My family and friends really enjoyed the party so much and as you know, a great party always starts with good food. Great job!!! Thank you Geo!!!!!!"}

{"text":"We used Geo's Tacos to cater our wedding reception and were so happy with the experience. The food was delicious and they were able to help us with table, chair and linen rental as well. They showed up the day before to drop off supplies and the rental items so we had time to set up then accommodated our schedule to arrange pick up the day after the event. The tacos were so delicious and Geo and his staff were so kind and courteous to us and our guests. They kindly wrapped up the leftovers which reheated nicely. I'm looking forward to some more carne asada leftovers tonight!"}

Very pleased and will definitely use them again!"}
