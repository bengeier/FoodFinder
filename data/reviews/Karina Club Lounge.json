{"text":"Bartenders are thieves. Besides the service is the worst ever, They charge you  whatever they want. I ordered 1 beer and 1 tequila shot and this guy was charging me 25 dls :/ I asked how much were the drinks and he did not know what to say. Then I went to an other bar station and the same happened again 1 beer 12 bucks??????? I asked why the beer before was 6 bucks And the barmaid said that after 2 am the price goes up Not going back ever."}
{"text":"Its an OK place when it fills up. Usually no lineups and hardly had to pay the cover fee. I've walked in and out of Karina's a couple of times because there was no atmosphere. I do have to say that when the place is crowded and the music is good its a really fun place and drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night.  It was alright.  Not crowded at all so we didn't stay long.  Came back later in the night and it was even more dead.

Lots of techno and dance.  But we did ask the DJ to play some Hip Hop and he squeezed two songs in."}
{"text":"Went last night, I'm usually very understanding of people not having the best day, you can't be \"on\" all the time, and you can't take a day off work just cause you don't feel like it, but this waitress took the cake... I understand maybe smiling less or being less friendly, but responding \"It doesn't matter to me\" when asked about a suggestion about what we should drink, was just wow... I got my panties all in a bunch right away, wanted to just walk right out, but my girlfriends aren't ones to cause a scene and they reminded me that misery loves company and I shouldn't join her pity party, and best thing I can do is to not let it ruin my night and have fun anyway... We stayed for a bit, had a few drinks, but my night lost that \"glow\"... Nothing against the place itself, the drinks were also good, and I know I shouldn't let a  little thing like that bother me,... but it did ;("}
{"text":"The place is ok. The music seems to be the best part of the place. Had a huge problem getting my jacket once, it took about 45 min for them to find it, pretty frustrating in the winter when you want to leave already. Drink prices are fair and the people who go there usually is because it was their last resource."}
{"text":"After continuously having to interrupt the bartender from the tennis match on TV to get some drinks, the show began! The most entertaining part? Not the young and insecure \"dancers\" but the drunken idiots that interrupted the show, yelled and ran into people - for about 20 minutes. All security did was move them ... then left. The girls did do a good job blocking them out.

Drinks were pricey and weak. 

Nice bar and lounge area ... poorly managed. Location and ambiance not being used to their full potential."}
{"text":"So tacky and ridiculous but pretty fun. When I was here they had all sorts of dancers and gymnasts. The drinks, like Winston's downstairs, were overpriced, and the crowd was yuck but if you can get past that you can have a great time."}
{"text":"No cover on the Saturday night were there. The DJ played top 40's + dance/electronic. The dance floor was full, nice mix of college and mid aged people. Great to dance and just let go,"}
{"text":"Nice chill lounge to have a couple of drinks with friends/coworkers after work (6-8). Usually not packed at all. However, not usually the quietest of places as the music was pretty loud for a lounge setting. Manager was extremely friendly last time I was there! 

Never been to Karina on a \"clubbing\" night so I have no clue how that fares."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We're doing out staff party there every year.
The guys are great, food is good and we always get discounts on drinks."}
{"text":"We walked in because there was a girl outside telling us there was no cover and there were $5 drink specials. After paying $10 for several clubs on the block, this was a welcome change. However, the top floor where all the dancing was was a little too tame. Looked more like a place to sit down and relax to loud music than a club. The first floor is more of a sports bar though."}
{"text":"Pretty nice club.  Lots of entertainment walking around on an event weekend which just makes the spectacle better, but I'd venture to say there might be other clubs equally good if not better?"}
