{"text":"Nice family who runs this place. Most of the time good service. The food is mediocre at best. The last couple of times we have come here the food is room temperature to cold. I hope the dream succeeds, but there has to be a way to better way to warm the pre cooked food so it comes out warm."}
{"text":"The review on the service alone isnt worth the 1 star. This establishment has to be the worst service ever! 

As our party entered the dining area, we were asked to seat ourselves (not a problem). We we were unaware we had to order our own food (at the bar) ask for literally everything including condiments and napkins, help the server distribute our order ( yes you read that correct) and ask for the tab. We we never asked for refills or an apology for getting our order wrong.

Helpful hint to the owner, if you want a more efficient dining area, GET RID of the \"server\" with the baby feet tattoos. This lady is ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS and is costing your establishment patrons & money. We were not the only ones to complain on this evenings service by the same server.

It's a shame.."}
{"text":"Unfortunately customer service is not part of the plan here. We sat, while other people were handed menus, and we were ignored by wait staff because we didn't sit in the area. Even when we chased after a waitress, she was rude that she had to get our waitress. We left shortly after."}
{"text":"What a joke this place is!!! New name same crappy service. Waited 15 mins for someone to serve me (during happy hour nonetheless) and hardly anyone in there. One girl handling bar and tables and then when she finally comes out to serve the table she had no clue who has been waiting the longest. Got up and walked out. Don't understand why this place has to continue to have the worst service in all of Peoria. Hey Erik, it still sucks....."}
{"text":"I finally did make it back to this so called sports bar to watch a Sunday NFL game, and man, what a mistake that was.  I got there a little before 11:00 and there were only 6 - 7 people in the bar.  With 15 - 20 TVs I asked for the one directly in front of me to be tuned to the Rams/Vikings.  I was planning on ordered some lunch, but decided to wait.  Soon some other game came on so I flagged the waitress down again.  About 10 minutes later the game came on, already 6 minutes into the 1st quarter.  A few minutes later the Rams scored and it appeared they were cutting away for a commercial, but it was a Billy Blanks commercial !!!!  I thought it was odd, and after 5 minutes realized it was a different channel. I flagged down the waitress again.  She reported it to the manager, and a couple of minutes later the Packer game came on.  OMG... I got up again and spoke with the mgr and he said he would correct it, then I headed for the bathroom.  It was clean, but you couldn't close the door on the toilet.  Nothing like looking out into the bar when you are sitting down trying to do your business.  I went back to my table and the PACKER game was on........ It was near halftime and the couple sitting two tables down from me got up in discuss and left.  Another guy who was trying to watch the Ram game did the same.  I decided to leave too, that left 3 people in the place.  I went to Chili's on Bell Rd and watched the Vikes/Rams game.  I sat at the bar and watched the game on a TV right in front of me, and enjoyed a great order of Chicken Nachos.  I was not a regular customer of Legends, but I am now NO customer of Legends Sports Bar.  It was a BAD EXPERIENCE, but I saw a great 2nd half of Football at Chili's"}
{"text":"Never again will I visit this establishment. I took my family in on Sunday night 8/27 after a very long day and was looking forward to some good food in our neighborhood. Waitress came over quickly and took our drink orders and actual order.. but we never saw her again. Then, about 20 minutes later, a different waitress came and asked if we needed anything, I asked for water which I got quickly. But when I asked for our food, she said she would check on it. 10 minutes after that, she hadn't even really gone back into he kitchen to check (I could see the kitchen entrance).. and when I went to ask for our drink check, she looked in be kitchen and said our food was ready. Are you kidding me- no thanks. We didn't order anything that should have taken any longer than 10-12 minutes to make and that is if you were backed up, which you were not.. only one other table in there who managed to get their food.. and I believe they ordered AFTER us. They asked if we wanted our food boxed up- again, no thanks for food that was likely sitting out for several minutes. I was asked if I wanted to see the manager, no- because what was he going to do?? Take me back in time to get my food faster? And the reason I was given was there was only one server tonight and one bartender. Your staffing issues.. should not be my problem!! Seriously.. if there was a manager on site, why weren't they out there helping your only server. There were several people there to play poker, so you knew it would be busy. I will not bring my family back, which sucks because we like your food and drinks.. and I will share this with all friends in the neighborhood to make sure they don't visit this location either."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in a long time. And when we finally did get our food...horrible. Don't waste your time with this place"}
{"text":"Try be loaded tater tots! The beer choices are almost endless. It's nice that they have mixed beers now. Try the apples and oranges which is Blue Moon and angry orchard. Another good one is the peach schapps and Blue Moon.  The music is usually a bit loud if you want to converse with someone. It's a nice local hangout though with good food and beer choices."}
{"text":"Always have a blast when I go to LSC! Great local sports bar. Wide open restaurant to the bar. No shortage of TV's. All the staff are super friendly, personable and quick on their feet. Our food comes out quick, delicious and love how they have a game day menu on football days!"}
{"text":"Great service! Sam was awesome as our server and Gerald is the new owner ... now that this is now legends and no longer funyguys! Excellent food, service, atmosphere and of course any game you want! Great drink specials, 25 tvs and GOLDEN TEE, pool and darts plus a bloody may bar!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, GREAT bartender! Brit took great care of us, was attentive, friendly, and overall was one of the best bartenders I've had a in a long time!"}
{"text":"No basketball package, no hockey,won't get baseball, shouldn't be called Sports club,Really, how do you figure. You need sports to be called a Sports Club. Change name The Bar!"}
{"text":"Service is slow and poor. I've tried the food twice, hoping that maybe it was just an off day the first time my friends and I had stopped by. Unfortunately it was still bad. Food is tasteless- dry burnt wings, soggy nachos with burnt meat, bland hummus. The drinks are watered down- no matter what drink I've sent back and ordered something else- still bad. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"Service sucks there, if you plan to go hang out with some Friends expect to see your server once every 40 mins. Ordered beer during happy hour thinking I would get the happy hour price. The server never explained the happy hour drinks sizes even though she knew we ordered the wrong ones. Small Tv's in the place, you can definitely find a better sports bar to watch a big game instead of this place."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even want to fake that they have their act together. After I approached the bar to ask for a waitress for the second time my waitrEss made her way over to me. Come to find out it was the same young lady I saw looking straight at me minutes before. They hand you a menu that is so worn some words can't be read. Nothing about this menu makes me want to order your food, (I considered leaving and decided to go ahead and just order food) but I did... And then waited 20 minutes for boneless wings. Only for the waitress to come back over to me and tell me they made my wings wrong so they're going to restart them. I paid for my beer and left. I like the GM seems like a genuinely nice guy, but get some employees that focus on service over bullshiting with the regulars."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, service very slow.  Had to wait 25 minutes for pretzel bites on a Saturday at 1pm and another 15 minutes for our food.  There were only a few other people in there, not sure what the hold up was.  Had to get up and ask for our check.  There was only one waitress helping the entire floor plus tending bar....hire some help for both the front and back of the house."}
{"text":"UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Came for the BEST chicken sliders in the world. Just found out they changed hands from Funugys to Legends. Hello money loving franchise. The menu totally suffers because of this. No more sliders!  The menu sucks! Typical bar food. No thought for quality or taste. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Service was poor, initially only one waitress, then apparently they had a couple more begin a shift. Service did not improve. Seating is uncomfortable and not comfortable with the arrangement of tvs to watch a game. Huge football fan go religiously to watch at sports bars with family and friends. Been here a couple of times to give it a fair chance. Still not pleased won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of the worst if not the worst food experience of my life. Should have guessed this since even my ice tea tasted funky like the ice tea maker had never been cleaned. Order a basic bacon cheese burger and garlic fries. Burger order medium well came out very raw like could see pink without even cutting into burger and they forgot the bacon looked so bad couldn't even take a bite. The fries I ate a whole 3 were still mostly frozen and had some weird glaze on  them that def was not garlic. I would have sent all of it back but I had the cooks complaining about another table that had sent food back and did not trust that they wouldn't have done something to my food. The only thing good about the place was the bartender was very nice. I will not be going back to this place, and will recommend others to not go as well."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve a 1 star rating!  To the owner from one business owner to another, please close this place or sell to new ownership!  This is my neighborhood spot, so it pains me to see it run into the ground!  Friday, 9PM, came in to eat, took 15 minutes to get a menu, and not especially busy.  No UFC Fights, No football or anything special going on.  I finally order, wanted a burger and some wings.  \"Sorry, we are out of Burgers\", I am told by the server.  The look on my face must have been priceless!  How does a bar run out of burgers?  Is there a cow shortage I don't know about?  Could barely read the crappy faded menus, so I quickly decided on the carne asada tacos as a substitute.  \"Sorry, we no longer serve Carne Asada also\", the waitress embarrassingly states.  She was nice and said \"she just worked there\", obviously this was a bad situation for the help as well.  So, starving, I just ordered the wings.  No joke, I waited an hour and still no wings!  I paid my check for my drinks, went to Safeway and picked up some burger patties and grilled them in 10 minutes myself!  I will never go here again and I hope they fail so that someone who understands how to run a restaurant takes it over and gives me a product to enjoy."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Been in there a few times and service was horrible. Took forever then food ice cold. Has a good burger there once but that's about it."}
{"text":"Just left. Worst bartender ever. Hardly acknowledged us the entire time, and we we're the only two people there. Sat at the bar eating her food, checking her phone with a grumpy look on her face the whole time. The manager finally had to come over to cash us out.  Never again."}
{"text":"I seriously couldn't imagine that new ownership/management could make this neighborhood bar even worse-but they've done it!!! WTH!?! This used to be our favorite bar, every neighbor around loved this place but the already less than average service is now just awful! Why can't owners find really good bar managers and staff? Is it really that difficult? I normally try to support local, small business but after multiple attempts -it's not worth the 25 minutes to get served or the 45 minutes for a burger. Just sad."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! First time there and enjoyed . Just came to Arizona for a visit and thought we give it a try it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place sucks!
Service is horrible 
Went to watch Cardinal game 
It is a Seahawks bar

Will never return"}
{"text":"Service sucked! I think there were only like 2 waitresses for a Friday night. At least that's how many I saw, it was packed.  We ended up only getting drinks due to the slow service. They do have a team game about music begin around 10.   They also had poker games in the back.  It had people dressed like ready to go clubbing, others like they just got out of the gym, others just casual... I don't it was different."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some wings after work and I was met with a stench that could only be described as sewage or moldy water. I ordered a beer and somr wings, beer was semi warm. Wings came, smelled great, after 3 wings...long story short, I'm pulling off a couple feathers off the remaining wings."}
{"text":"Was playing poker there tonight. Had to listen to a player disrespecting other cultures. I was offended. I told that player that I was offended. I told him that he doesn't know anything about me and watch what he said. I was removed from the game. I was told by the tournament director that the player could say what he wants because he knows him. I spoke to a manager that said he was too busy to deal with it. I guess in this place their regulars run the place and can run off new clientele. Poor management and customer service."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed in this place! My fiancé is from Washington, so some of his friends from Seattle that live in Peoria told us they just heard about a Seahawks bar near them so we drove from Chandler to meet them there. 

It was a Sunday during a game, so when we sat down at a table outside I wasn't expecting a waitress to run right over. After twenty minutes of sitting there and seeing a waitress come out and help several people around us (and after I made eye contact with her several times and tried to motion for service), I went up to the bar to grab us drinks (which also took forever). After sitting there another twenty minutes and not getting offered any more service, we finished our beers, called our friends and asked if we could meet somewhere else down the street. 

It was awesome that it was filled with Seahawks fans, and might even be worth the drive since my fiancé is a huge Seahawks fan, but the completely awful service crossed this place off of our list for good. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has really stepped up their game in the last year! A regular place for me and my family. Bartenders are great and owners are always there making sure things are done right. The new food they have been making is on point. Taco Tuesday was the sh!t. They also have free breakfast on the weekends with great quality food. If you have had a bad experience before you should REALLY give them another shot. 5 stars for me any day."}
{"text":"Stopped there for lunch. People working and people who stopped were all fun and friendly. Bartender Leticia and Manager Nicole are a lot of fun. I stayed to watch an entire baseball game (Yes, I skipped work, but the boss won't care).

Free WI-Fi and free phone charger made my day! 

I'm sure I was given extra special attention because it was slow and not only because I'm extra special. I'll stop for happy hour to see how things are when it's busy."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great atmosphere and very outgoing owner! Service was so good, one on one with the owner! So fun! Great storytelling! We had a blast!"}
