{"text":"This place has got a good menu selection and the food had an authentic taste. The interior is much nicer than It's exterior leads on."}
{"text":"So the same owners of Scarborough's Twilight and Starlight have moved north of Steeles and opened up shop as what used to be called soca palace. The place has had a massive renovation but the best thing about this place is the bang for your buck. 

Caribbean Chinese food for so cheap and their lunch special feels like I may have traveled back in time about 10 years. $5.50 for most items. $3.25 for beers.

You would think with these prices that it is a snack size- but no a heaping amount of noodles arrived in front of me and I was taken back. They also allow you to add a chicken leg - 4 chicken wings or a jerk chicken to any of the lunch specials for additional $2. I considered adding meat but thought I would try the noodles for the taste test first. I didnt get a chance to browse the regular menu items but they looked good with lots more options both Caribbean Chinese and Caribbean Indian.

Great place- I am sold and will be back quite regularly."}
{"text":"This is the best Caribbean food spot in Markham. I always get the \"ginger fried rice with shrimp and chicken. I highly recommend you check out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"First visit, it was a nice place hidden in the corner of a usually dry plaza. I haven't been here before the renovation but It's a nice eat lovated in the center of many neighborhoods. The Chilli Chicken has a unique taste, not too spicy, saucy but just right. The dishes were of equal or greater quality to that of places like bourbon or congee queen but for a much cheaper price. Lunch specials seem definitely worth the price. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food isn't as good as other Caribbean style restaurants in the area. If you grew up in a west indian household you'll find the food very bland, even the pepper wasnt very good. Found a hair in my food almost all the way through my food. I will not be going back here"}
