{"text":"The chicken enchiladas are excellent, and the burritos were gigantic \"! I will be back to try the pork carnitas.  The place is small, and the noise level can be a bit much, so I will try to go during down time."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Wanted to avoid fast food while in the area. Think fast food would have been the better choice. Totally wasted 11 bucks. Walked out hungry. Left the nasty brick of a burrito on the table. Will not recommend"}
{"text":"Parking can suck, but it's worth it for the service and the food.  Since moving to PA from CA, finding good Mexican food has been an uphill battle.  Now that we know about Los Chiludos, we're thrilled!  Order at the counter, get your food quickly (a good choice for lunch if you have an hour), and have enough food left for lunch the next day.  Everything's good, but I recommend the carnitas platter!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Mexican food at a good price.  Everything was exceptionally fresh.  Only wish they were open later."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such a high rating. The food wasn't very good & it was really salty- and overpriced. No sauces for burritos & enchiladas just salsa. Mango salsa was good. Chips were thick cut and just so-so. The queso was gross. Service was terrible- young kids waiting on you that don't feel like being there It took me a few years to get there. Really disappointed. So much hype surrounding this place. Clearly people don't know good Mexican (hard to find in Pittsburgh). Go to El Camp. It's as good as you'll get in the South Hills."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is exquisite the staff is very friendly. 

Start by having the cheese dip and the mango salsa... always fresh and full of flavor. My go to are the chicken quesadillas with a side of rice and beans.  The chicken is pulled and seasoned to perfection. The rice isn't sticky it's light and fluffy, and the beans are freaking heavenly. 

Try a Jarrito (Mexican pop) they are very yummy. 

And don't forget dessert... The churros are hot and served with a side of chocolate dipping sauce. My husband loves the fried ice cream... Enjoy and viva Mexico."}
{"text":"Love their food!!  I get the veggie burrito and it's delish!  Their salsas are great too!  Meal portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I've lived in NYC, Philly and am out here in the little town of Canonsburg for work.  Los Chiludos makes it all worth it! One of the best Mexican places on the East Coast.  I've had their pulled pork - delicious!  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I just had one of their vegetarian dishes, spinach enchilladas, today... and yum! Bring your appetite... portions are generous and the prices are fair.  If you come for lunch, be prepared for a crowd.  Yet, service was great and the place is clean.  Awesome, awesome!!  I just wish I could take them back to Philly with me!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican we've had outside of Chicago and New York since we left California. Who would expect it in a strip mall in an office park in a Pittsburgh suburb?

We've basically given up, but a Yelp review from someone who had worked at Chicago's excellent Topolobampo convinced us to give it a shot. 

The salsa was based on chiles, not watery tomatoes. The tacos were on soft corn tortillas, with onions and cilantro. The steak tacos were good, but the carnitas were excellent. 

The chorizo burrito (served \"wet\" for a small upcharge) was flavorful, the red sauce complex. 

Worth a drive."}
{"text":"Best place ever.  I would eat here everyday if I could.  Carnitas Platter is always tender and crispy with awesome salsa on top."}
{"text":"Very good, made from scratch food.  Different than most mexican restaurants in that you order at the counter.  Sort of fast-casual like Chipotle, but more authentic.  Employees were all friendly and had great service.  I will be going back!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Mexican restaurant around. I work in Southpointe and eat here at minimum once a week. Staff is great and actually knows my \"special order\" every time I go. I've had a few items (burritos, fajitas, various specials, all of which are fantastic) but I always come back to the chicken combo platter. You get more food than you know what to do with for the price a a McDonald's value meal!! Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Amazing food everytime! I've tried all over the area and this is by far the best Mexican. I've been going since they started out on route 980. Los Chiludos! AKA the tomato by the way. Oh also the friendly service is awesome everytime. There hasn't been a disappointment yet and I've gone and tried many things. Chicken and steak fajitas are best! Also the size of the meals are great! Always have leftovers and I eat alot!"}
{"text":"The last two times I've ordered the chili con queso, I received half the serving. The quality and price is great if I received the full order. I won't be coming back for a while."}
{"text":"Excellent food made fresh and with care in an open kitchen. The prices on the menu seem high but when you see the quantity of food you get you won't feel ripped off. I think a burrito is almost 2 pounds."}
{"text":"Rice had a large amount of garlic in it.  I'll taste for a week for sure.  Chips were definitely not the best in town.  Taco meat was good but too spicy for a 7 year old.  Margarita had no tequila in it.  Tasted the same as the virgin one we got for the kids."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place. My kiddo has food allergies and they totally cooperate with her special needs. The burritos are huge, chimmichangas  cheesy, and guacamole with mango salsa is great! Everything valued for their fresh foods!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Carnitas muy delicioso. Enough for two . AJ is a very attentive server. We wanted for nothing. First time here. From California home to authentic mexican comida"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Quick service, great price and a burrito so big I couldn't finish it. Would defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"To start they have the best Mexican food in southwest PA and the best customer service! I've been a few times and everything I've had there has been delicious. Went there yesterday and ordered shrimp tacos (2). After we sat down an employee can up to me to inform me that they only had enough shrimp for one taco and apologized. They gave me the option of changing my order completely or having one shrimp taco and another type of taco. I choose to have one shrimp and one steak taco. I admit I was a little bummed but things happen. When I got my order the server apologized for not having been able to complete my order for 2 shrimp tacos. Both tacos were great! The cashier came by my table when we were finishing to apologize and gave me a gift certificate for an order of shrimp tacos. I was going to be coming back anyways but this shocked me. They went above and beyond what most restaurant would do. Can't wait to go back for more shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Being a recent Pittsburgh transplant, I continue to be astonished by the lack of restaurant diversity in the south South Hills area (Mt. Lebo, USC, Bethel Park, Peters) . No Indian, no Vietamese, no Peruvian, no Korean. An ethnic food desert. Naturally I was excited about this place after reading the reviews. But spending $8-$9 for 2 tacos is just ridiculous. Tacos and burritos are meant to be cheap yet good Mexican fast food. The good part was that cod and carnitas were delicious. The chicken was okay. I would like to frequent more often but it is highly unlikely after dropping 50 bucks for just 9 tacos and chips/guac. Crazy. Would rather spend half that at Las Palmas."}
{"text":"This place is as authentic it gets to a Mexican restaurant. They definitely stepped up with their relocation to Southpoint. The friendly staff greets you at the front where you also place your order. There is a variety of classic dishes, but also a combination which makes it possible to taste more than one dish. The tables are clean and the workers are very polite. Dinner and lunch can be as cheap as 8 bucks a person for a good size plate. They recently got a liquor license so that is a plus as well. 

I definitely recommend this place for their authentic platters and their fresh food. It is not a romantic place, but a nice establishment for a good bite to eat. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"This place is probably perfect for suits to pop in for lunch every day. These reviews are probably the same people the come in every single day. This place is located in the middle of hundreds of office buildings. There isn't anywhere else to eat around it unless you want to drive 20 min. 

These customers that work in the area have to eat here.

But if you are trying to go out to eat a nice decent dinner with your family? Pass. This place is set up to serve regulars who know whats on the menu and don't care about being served like a regular restaurant. 

Order your food at the register when you walk in and grab a cup to fill up at the fountain. 

It's a very low class fancy Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Listen to my words when I say this: Awesome Mexican food for SW PA/Pittsburgh Area. I lived in California, AZ, This is pretty close to authentic and could hold it's own to any Tijuana vendor.  Overall This place rocks."}
{"text":"Absolutely far and away the BEST Mexican food in PA!!!  There is no need to get Mexican food somewhere else it will only be disappointing compared to Los Chiludos."}
{"text":"In recent years I have become a fan of mexican food, mainly at the hands of a small restaurant in Washington, Pa by the name of Old Mexico. I used to think that no place in the tri-state area compared to this place and I would make weekly visits to make sure I got my mexican fix. On a friends recommendation, I decided to try Los Chiludos in my own backyard of Canonsburg. Man, was I surprised! A husband and wife team prepare all the meals fresh, and from scratch. Each meal is prepared how you like it and the portions are huge. This is, by far, the best mexican food on this side of the state. No matter what you get, you will be satisified with the results and will be coming back for more. I am a regular now, just about every saturday afternoon my girlfriend and I go there and try to order something different each time so we can sample the entire menu, and nothing has disappointed us!"}
{"text":"Without question my favorite burrito place - huge, hot, tasty, fresh and authentic!
Mango salsa and chips are incredibly delicious. Always fast service and friendly waitstaff I would highly recommend this family owned business!"}
{"text":"I can eat the breaded cod fish tacos any number of times... The fish tacos are the best i find here..."}
{"text":"I was directed here by my fellow yelpers, once again I was not let down. Came here for lunch. First Impression was this place is packed and there is a lot of movement behind the counter watching the chef crank out peoples dishes. I walked up to the counter since I wasn't sure of the ordering protocol in this place but the lady was really nice and explained everything to me and I was also very happy about her being up front with me about how long it was taking to get food out. She said that today they are really busy and it may take 30 minutes to get your meal. Fine by us, I ordered some salsa and chip but since I had never tried any of their salsa she was kind enough to give me a half order of the ranchero salsa and the mango salsa. I thought both were very good but the mango salsa was more my speed. For my lunch I had the Carnitas platter which was a ton of food for lunch. Holy cow and only for $8. The pork was flavorful and I really enjoyed the tomatillo salsa that they put over the top of it, I mixed it all together to make sure each taco I made had an equal portion of the sauce mixed into it. The pinto beans were outstanding to, who would ever think pinto beans could be that good. But I was really impressed with the overall service at this place. We got our food in about 15 minutes as opposed to the 30 min. but I appreciate the honesty, and each person here was very helpful and answered my array of questions with patience. They seemed like they were all generally have an okay time. This place almost is what will take me back to the taco shops of the Southwest US. I think I will officially designate this as my go to Mexican joint in Pittsburgh. I will certainly be back. Owww!"}
{"text":"I almost gave up on finding good mexican food in Pittsburgh and accepted the fact that maybe Petron's was as good as it gets here. Then I was turned on to this place and I now have somewhere to take my family from out west for mexican fare and they won't be disappointed. The cooks at Los Chiludos are the real deal. They care about making great food. The giant Lexan of fresh tortilla chips says it all. They cook from scratch with love, passion, and culture. This place will be around forever because their food is that good. If you are only going to Mad Mex for the booze (which in my opinion you should) then go to Los Chiludos for the food."}
{"text":"Typical Tex-Mex food I was not overly impressed Granite it was very good and fresh however I think the portions were little small they also charge you for your chips and salsa which kind of caught me off-guard considering most Mexican restaurants do not do that the service and atmosphere we're very good overall I would go back however I feel there are much better Mexican restaurants in the McMurray vicinity"}
{"text":"This is absolutley my favorite mexican restaurant! It is truly authentic mexican food that is consistently excellent! Love that it is locally owned and they take great pride in making sure you are completely happy with your visit.  The atmosphere and service is"}
{"text":"This place was great! We came in after work on a Friday and I was expecting it to be pretty packed but we were seated right away! Everyone there treats you like family and makes conversation with you as if they've known you forever. My drink was never empty because our waitress Sophia was in the ball. I loved the atmosphere here! It was a tiny & intimate place with maybe 14 tables and a bar! 

We ordered a basket of chips with guacamole & mango salsa for the table and oh my we're the dips AMAZING. I've never had a mango salsa before so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was so flavorful &  juicy. So great. And the guacamole was even better! After looking over the menu I decided on the Grilled Chicken fajita. This, I'm not kidding you, literally took only 7 minutes to come out. Talk about service! Everything was steaming hot. The grilled veggies were cooked to perfection and the tortillas were warmed and wrapped in foil to keep the heat. Everything was so amazing & flavorful. 

I'm so happy with my trip here. The service was amazing, the food was outstanding, and the employees were so sweet! They will definitely get my business again. And it's so close to my house/ score!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - took my mind back to California - this is great Cali Mex -ordered chicken platter on back of menu but substituted beef instead...my mouth is watering even after being stuffed.  Lots of flavor- felt like someone's mama was in the kitchen cooking."}
{"text":"Food overly salted.  Over priced for the quality.  The salsa Verde lacks flavor.  I will not be rushing back.  Table was also not bussed very well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the area.  Their queso is outstanding!"}
{"text":"It was very fresh. Best tacos were the shrimp amd the fried cod! Will return to try some specials :)"}
{"text":"Best mexican in the Pittsburgh area, period.  All food is fresh and it's not tex mex or Americanized slop.  Fresh ingredients and good service.  Only Mexican place where you can get fresh jalapeños, not out of a jar or can!"}
{"text":"I have gone to MANY Mexican restaurants in California, Colorado and Pittsburgh.  Los Chiludos, in Canonsburg is the real deal.  It's a family owned small restaurant and I haven't had a mediocre dish yet.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Greater Pittsburgh area.  I don't get to go very often because it is out of the way a bit, but it is always worth the trip!  The guacamole is excellent - very fresh and not too spicy.  I also enjoy the mango salsa.  I love the Carnitas so much, I have never ordered anything else!  The portions are very large, so I always get some to take home and make two meals out of one.  My hubby likes the burrito and orders it wet with red sauce.  The red sauce is slightly smoky and not too spicy.  The burrito is huge!  I wanted to weigh it. I have never been disappointed.  They are good for kids too!"}
{"text":"We stopped her based on Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. I just wish it was much closer to home."}
{"text":"Working so close to this place is simultaneously the best and worst thing that's ever happened to me. Best because I have fantastic food basically across the street every single day. Worst because I spend all of my very little extra money there."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in the area! They have the best tacos and the carnitas is unreal. Everything from the rice to the guacamole to the quesadillas is amazing. I get my fix from here at least twice a month, sometimes once a week. The hours are a little different so just check and make sure they are open!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area, I finally found this amazing place.  The employees were very friendly.  I ordered to go, the guac and chips and shrimp tacos.  My order was done very quickly, a good thing for lunch if you work in Southpointe.  My food was still warm when I got home.  The guac and chips were very good.  I loved the shrimp tacos, they were amazing.  I can't wait to try more of their food."}
{"text":"Dinner at Los Chiludos tonight was the highlight of my week! My friend suggested we do Mad Max because she had a coupon and suggested the Canonsburg location. I said if we're going to Canonsburg we're going to go to Los Chiludos. Started off with a wonderful Margarita on the rocks it was just perfect. The chips and guac were more than enough to share the chips fresh and crisp the guacamole was actually basically your avocado and a little bit of cilantro lime salt. Personally not fond of cilantro was amazed at how delicious this guacamole was. I ordered the chicken chimichanga, it was was huge.  You get your choice of green or red chili sauces comes with the rice and the pinto beans. The seasoned shredded chicken inside was amazing. My friend did the enchiladas in the Verde sauce, she ate every bite of them. I wish to God we had some room for churros. I am doing dessert first the next time and I plan  on trying the steak fajitas. I love to support a locally-owned restaurant. I will be back"}
{"text":"Great service. Love the Mexican style feel! Love how the kitchen is right their and you can see it! This place is amazing and you should definitely go and check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was delicious and so flavorful and the margarita were great. Everything was very reasonably priced, can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"I never really had real Mexican before ... Well at least not that I remember.  I mean, I've actually been to Mexico a few times but I don't think you can refer what I did as \"enjoying Mexican cuisine.\"  

Drunken chalupas after a bottle of tequila does not a meal make.

I Really enjoy this place.  Never had a bad meal here.  Sometimes our company will cater a lunch through them and it's never a disappointment.  From what others have told me and from my limited memory, they do a pretty decent job at authenticity here.

Not to mention, price divided by amount equals a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food very authentic!! Huge burritos great tacos and a friendly staff the only reason I don't give them a five star rating is the hours aren't great they close early for those of us that just can't get out of work by 5!!"}
{"text":"Mexican is one of my favorite types of cuisine. It is really hard to find really good Mexican food. Local restaurants are always better than chains & this one does not disappoint. 

A friend told me they had the best guacamole & she was right. It was so creamy & delicious. I dream about it & wish I lived closer to eat it more often.

I also had the chorizo chimichanga & it was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. I'm obsessed with both chorizo & chimichangas. Nothing better. I'm salivating just thinking about it.

If you love Mexican, you have to try this place. It's one of the few PGH Mexican places worth going to."}
{"text":"You've got to try this place if you like a bit more authentic Latino food!  Also, a bonus was they have some of the best chips and salsa I've ever had. If I lived any closer, I'd probably eat there multiple times a week."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place thanks to Yelp while driving through. Well worth getting off the beaten path. Not your typical Mexican joint. Delish fried fish tacos with mango salsa, unbelievably big burritos and yummy chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a good review because others will flock here. After hearing about this place for quite some time, I finally went there. Staff could not have been nicer, food was great and prices were cheap.

We had the sopes. It was enough for two people who had previously chowed down on a ton of chips. Very good. Very authentic. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The best Mexican place in town. My tip, order takeout if you can, because the dining area leaves a lot to be desired. It's cramped, loud and you're going to have to fight five other patrons once a table finally opens up. While this place lacks in ambiance, it more than makes up for it in excellent food."}
{"text":"Very good however service was slow but we noticed it was just our waitress, others were served quickly. Margaritas could be a little stronger but the food makes up for that. Very good! I had the mix and match tacos with steak, carnitas and cod fish and I couldn't even tell you which one I liked the best bc they were all very good. The guacamole was so good too! Overall, really impressed and will be back often as my parents live nearby."}
{"text":"I ate at the old Los Chiludos on First Street, and thought it was not great. In fact, it's hard to believe this is the same restaurant, as, not only has the menu changed, the food has as well, and much for the better. 

We started with an order of guacamole and chips. The guac here is so similar to what you'd find in Mexico that I found myself instantly transported there in my mind, where it's most often a very simple dip of roughly mashed avocado with a squirt of fresh lime, a sprinkle of salt and maybe a handful of cilantro and chopped serrano chiles. Theirs was very much like that, but with the addition of a little garlic. The chips are wonderfully thick and crisp, with not a hint of greasiness to them. I went for the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, and asked for no sour cream or cheese. You get two with a lunch order, and that was plenty for me, as they fill them well. These are great...nice pulled chicken, good quality corn tortillas and a salsa verde that rivals the best I've had...fresh tasting and slightly tart from the acidic tomatillos. Delish. I asked the woman taking our order to skip the rice, and they very kindly put some extra beans on my plate. They make pinto beans here and keep them very simple in their brothy bath. Perfection. 

I've tried Mexican food all over the Burgh, and been disappointed every single time. I can say with confidence that this is the best I've had in this area. I worked at Frontera Grill/Topolobampo in Chicago for 8 years, and ate there every day I worked, so I truly miss eating the food and crave it regularly. And, while there's no restaurant outside of a few areas in this country where you can get Mexican food of that quality, this is fresh food, well prepared and full of flavor. 

Even though it's counter service here, the woman taking orders at the front came around to ask us how everything was and cleared our plates. She was friendly and helpful, and another woman working there held the door open for us when we left, so service is obviously a priority. It was busy when we visited and everyone was keeping their cool. Thumbs way up for the professionalism and smiles.

They have successfully applied for a liquor license here, but it'll be a couple of weeks before they offer alcohol, and they've discontinued the BYOB policy, so it's soft drinks for now, but soon they'll have a full bar."}
{"text":"This is not only the best Mexican place around Pittsburgh, it's one of the best Mexican places that I've ever been! The owner, hailing from Mexico City, has brought his homemade fare to Pennsylvania. 

The chips and homemade salsa are absolutely delicious. I've gotten the tortilla soup both times I've come here and it is great! Filled with shredded chicken, diced onions, cilantro and a perfectly spiced broth. 

The steak tacos, which you can get Mexicano (salsa, onions and cilantro) or Americano (tomatoes, lettuce, cheese and sour cream) are a force to be reckoned with! If you'd like it slightly different opt for the fish or shrimp tacos. 

The steak nachos are a meal unto themselves! Nacho chips piled high with marinated steak, cheese, tomatoes, and sour cream. Amazing!

The spot is very clean and the staff are great! Another upside to any Mexican place worth their salt; they carry Jarritos drinks I'm the bottle. Get the pineapple! 

Come here!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've eaten, seriously! Excellent priced, large portion's 
Dine in or take out, love done both. Clearly the best around."}
{"text":"This place is a popular spot for lunch. I have been here twice now.

The service was good. The food came out fast.

It's pretty decent Mexican food in relation to its geographic location.

This chips are homemade and really good. They also have some cheap drink specials like $3 margaritas."}
{"text":"So good! I'm from AZ originally so I love me some authentic Cali-Mex and this place is legit. Probably the best Cali-Mex I've had since moving to the Burgh 3 years ago. I loved the salsas, the burrito, the rice (and I hate rice in my burrito), etc. If you're in the area and love Mexican food, you have to try this place. I wish it was a little spicier and it wasn't as expensive as it was, but heck, I'll pay good money for a little bite of home! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yelp helped me find this place last year when I was looking for something new on my way to a Wild Things game in Washington PA (a yearly family event).  We went back again this year and it was exactly as I remembered.  The place is small and not really located near anything but business parks in Southpointe.  But it's cheap and delicious and highly recommended.

We've never had a problem dining in on a Saturday late afternoon (no wait time) but they are still hopping with take-out orders.  I seriously think there were more workers behind the counter and in the kitchen than there were patrons.  Based on their location, my guess is they do a great lunch business during the week.  There are a few tables but I can see it easily getting crowded.

They offer a wide selection of your typical Mexican fare at reasonable prices.  And the portions are huge!  The fajita platters are served overflowing with ingredients.  The burritos and chimichangas are bigger than you might expect - definitely could be shared or last two meals.  I've personally tried the chorizo chimichanga and the carnitas burrito.  I'm still not sure which is my favorite.  The queso dip and guacamole were favorites of our entire party, especially with those homemade chips.  All our meals came with rice and beans.  They have a few options for the drinker: tequila, margaritas, and a nice beer selection.  Service was attentive and friendly.

My only real reason for deducting one star is the lack of platter options.  You can order a taco plate that has 3 different tacos but not an option where you might get, say, an enchilada, a taco and a taquito.  Sometimes I like a little variety.  Which is why I started going to Los Chiludos in the first place."}
{"text":"Chimichangas are excellent. I prefer TexMex and the food here walks a fine line between different and amazing. I was very pleased."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Jose and the boys got it goin on. The habanero salsa and the enchiladas are worth whatever it takes to get there."}
{"text":"The past reviews say it all.  If I'm in the area around lunchtime, I have to stop here.  Usually go with a burrito but next time I will have to try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Mango salsa rocks!  La cerveza was much needed! Chips were great too!  Service has always been awesome.  Love the atmosphere and staff.  Highly recommend to all for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Me & my family go here at least once a week! I highly recommend the tortilla soup and the shrimp volcano bowl! My faves! And the staff is amazing- friendly and prompt!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They make one of the best burritos I've ever had! You will not believe how big and heavy the burrito is. The shredded chicken is phenomenal, and the flavor is delicious!"}
{"text":"This a cool Mexican restaurant with a variety of food that changes with weekly specials. Definitely a good place to visit."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh-made guac, super-friendly staff, and easy to order.  Really huge portions - come hungry...

Don't come expecting a ton of ambience - it's low-key here, just really great non-chain (errmm... Big Burrito, I'm looking at you right now) Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here recently, and was delighted with some aspects, but disappointed at others.  

Walked in, was handed a menu and after deliberation ordered at the counter.  I kind of felt like I was at a fast food restaurant like Wendy's or Taco Bell.  I was given a glass and was directed to the Soda machine like at McDonalds.

We placed an order for four different main course items which included my cheese enchiladas, the wife's tacos, the daughters chicken everything tray, and the granddaughters cheese quesadilla and two orders of chips and salsa.  I've eaten at dozens of Mexican Restaurants all over the country from Michigan to Texas and out of the good ol USA in Mexico, and this was only the second occasion I had where you paid extra for the chips and salsa (maybe because the salsa is very special).  Taco Bell is the other place.

I rate the main course meals as just above average, and the salsa (Mango & Pesto) above average.  The chips themselves are well above average.  They provided jalapeño's on a table beside the soda machine, and they were very tasty, and a welcome addition to the chips and salsa.  The Carmel Suckers as an after meal treat were very good.

The place was very clean, the workers very friendly, ample parking and the establishment easy to find.  I was just disappointed in the fast food service and being charged for salsa and chips.  

Will we go back?  Probably not.  My $47 bill plus tip was a little high for fast food service."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Mexican food! Made to order! Fresh, simple ingredients! We usually get the taco sampler. You can pick from chicken, fish, chorizo, steak. Chorizo is my favorite - flavorful and just the right amount of spice. The salsas are homemade and delicious! The burritos are huge and yummy!! Can't do wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, friendly staff. I got the quesadilla.. Wonderful. The rice and beans were very good as well. The staff is really friendly. I will definitely be going back. The only complaint I have is they're never open! Sunday's and Mondays closed and usually pretty early closing hours throughout the week."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there Saturday night with our toddler.  We loved it!  The food was fresh and flavorful, prices low and service great.  I wrote a review on my blog: http://crayonsanddrywall.com/2014/08/06/los-chiludos-restaurant-review/"}
{"text":"Excellent. Lunch platter of mini chicken burrito and tortilla soup was delicious and plentiful. Lunch buddy's chicken quesadilla was also delicious.

Wait staff was very helpful and courteous.

I thought the chips could have used a bit more salt though."}
{"text":"Southpointe and Canonsburg's hidden Mexican treasure. Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious. Whether you dine in or carry out, from the burritos to the quesadillas and on, the flavors will not disappoint! Small, family owned foodery with a lot of heart and soul and deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to carnitas many years ago by a client in San Diego and to this day I can't get enough if I know they are good. Here they are excellent along with everything else I tried. This is for sure a hole in the wall that needs to be tried! Spicy Spicy!"}
{"text":"These raving reviews are from people who don't have high standards . We drove far to check this place out  nothing impressed!

Tasteless pintos, no refried beans, tasteless chicken in enchiladas, steak was tasteless and tough,
 Corn tortillas were wet and soggy, cheese dip thick and not very good, green artificial margaritas, very greasy ground beef...

You have to pay for chips and salsa and get your drinks . You serve yourself...


I wanted to believe the reviews!  I think they lied so other people would come out and waste their money.

The rice was the worst ever eaten in my 52 years.

El campesino, Emiliano's and patron are far superior 

I found the lighting harsh and booths uncomfortable here. The only thing we liked was the chipotle salsa but it was not spicy

Staff was friendly but not worth going back"}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican in the greater Pittsburgh area! I love their Chicken Tortilla soup, such amazing flavor! Get the soup eatin rather than take out for a bigger portion and have them add some extra cheese. So delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. This totally authentic cuisine is second to none. My experience goes something like this (beedubs the waitstaff knows my order by heart):

1. Start with hot (temperature not spicy) queso dip and mango salsa
2. Order mango Jaritto 
3. For my main meal it varies from the Tinga tostada --which is two flat rounded corn tortillas underneath a bed of perfectly seasoned shredded chicken that has shredded romain lettuce on top with queso blanco drizzled over it all
Or the steak salad-- don't ask questions just get it, so good.
4. If you've got a sweet tooth try the churros, they are fresh and hot and served with a side of chocolate 

The owners and waitstaff are always a delight. The kitchen and dinning room share the same area so if you plan on dinning in, be prepared to wear the smell of mexican food for the rest of the day :)"}
{"text":"The only burrito that compares to this one was at Revolution in Sayulita.  Absolutely world class stuff."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here off the recommendation of a friend. We came in after work and even though it's pretty small on the inside, we easily got a table. 

Our service was great. Server was friendly, attentive, and helpful. We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer and it was delicious and tasted super fresh. Easily the best part of the meal. 

I ordered the veggie burrito. It was huge!! I'm talking massive. The ingredients were good, but my only complaint was the beans were refried. I much prefer black beans, but I don't even think they have them (I'll check next time I go back)."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Mexican food. Smokey salsa and Guacamole were awesome along with chicken, beef and pork tacos. Enjoyed side of rice and soup. First visit and looking forward to summer dining on patios with of course - cervesas"}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican (or quasi Mexican) around. Try the grilled jalapeños and the mango margaritas. I always get the spinach enchiladas. Never had a bad meal here. If you go for lunch, be prepared for a line.  Or call your order in for take out."}
{"text":"After seeing so many positive reviews and working less than 5 minutes away, I had to try Los Chiludos. Their hours make it difficult for an after-work dinner (only open until 8pm, and not open for dinner at all on Mon-Tues) so I ordered take out for lunch.

When I arrived to pick up the food there were no parking spaces - obviously a popular lunch spot. I excused my way around the line that went to the door to pick up my carry out and rushed back to my office to feast.

I got the chicken burrito lunch (they call it 'mini' and it was still huge), wet with red sauce and cheese, and it was delicious. A bit heavy for a work lunch but the chicken was tasty and the chips on the side were a nice touch. I also got the chips and guac which was great as well - the chips were fried crispy and the guac was simple and a little creamy and tasty.

My colleagues got the cod fish tacos and the lunch combo and received positive feedback from them. The rest of my team wants to go there for lunch tomorrow and I may join for round 2."}
{"text":"I've searched high and low for good tacos in Pittsburgh and my favorite one so far is all the way out in Canonsburg.  They do taco Tuesdays where you can get 3 tacos for a very good lunch price.  My go-to tacos at Los Chiludos are fish, carnitas, and chorizo.  Their standard taco comes with a heaping serving of onions and cilantro, double wrapped with tortillas.  Their green sauce is delicious and I typically add enough jalapenos on top to turn up the spice.  The reasons why Los Chiludos crush all the taco places in Pittsburgh are simple:  GOOD price and they simply make good tacos!  No hipster weird tacos here.

The only wish list I have for Chiludos is please get lengua or tripa.  I am still on the search for those tacos in the area."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  The Sopes were great.  Almost as good as Mom's.  Their rice was good, also.  The menu is small but so far, this is the best Mexican restaurant I've found in the South Hills."}
{"text":"Food here is phenomenal, one of the best Mexican food I had in East coast. 
Check Restaurant timings on the day you choose to go here. 
Cons: Very limited wines, beers & cocktails.  Gets busier in lunch times and I felt many times that I am at a fast food place !
Will go back definitely when ever I visit Pittsburgh. I miss this food when I am at my hometown in NJ.
I just wish I could take them back to New Jersey with me !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food!!  I would recommend this to anyone.  Queso has a kick but is great.  Burrito's are huge."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are great. The food is amazing and affordable. The shrimp enchiladas are the best. Go if you live close."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Some of the things that others have complained about are what makes it awesome to me. The fact that I can order and pay before I get my food is a plus to me.  I HATE being ready to go home and have to wait on my check. Then wait on the server to come and get my card, blah, blah. You get my drift. I don't mind getting my own drink either, and the food is delicious!! I'm not a huge Mexican food person, but I think about this food all of the time. Chips and guacamole are excellent. I have had the mini chicken chimichanga, which is far from mini, a chicken burrito and chicken enchiladas. (Anyone noticing a theme here?). I love, love, love their red sauce it isn't spicy, but it is so flavorful. It is my favorite thing about this place. The food here has a LOT of flavor, unlike many Mexican restaurants. To me most Mexican restaurants have food that all tastes the same (equally bland/greasy/bad). Not the case at Los Chiludos. Also have a good Margarita. Definitely one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mexican food I have had.  The wet burritos are incredible.  The chips and salsa are top notch.  I have never had a bad meal.  This is by far the best Mexican in the state!"}
{"text":"Los Chiludos is a true authentic hidden gem in Southpointe. I work in southpointe, so I visit Chiludos A LOT, but it NEVER disappoints! The carnitas taco salad is my absolute favorite... and the $3 margaritas on Wednesdays :-)"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! I have eaten here multiple times over the last year. Never disappointed. They get extremely busy so get there early during lunch during the week. 
Food great and portions are big!"}
{"text":"Meh. I had high hopes. Margaritas were excessively sweet, no distinguishable tequila taste. Server was pretty attentive. Desperately wished we had salt for all dishes. The spicy salsa on tacos produced no spice at all.  Food was fresh but desperately bland. I hate wasting food but didn't take unfinished portions home. Perhaps good for area but certainly nothing to be excited about for the genre."}
{"text":"Small Tex-Mex resturant in Southpointe / Canonsburg. Food was ok nothing to brag about. It seemed more WesternPA enchilada than Mexican. Has potential."}
{"text":"Can't say enough. So good. Never had a bad meal. Used to work close by and now go out of my way to go here. Family owned. Recommend the fajitas wet burritos and tortilla soup!"}
{"text":"Disappointing, mediocre food with below average service. You walk in the door and your standing between right beside tables in a line of people looking a menus because you have to order for all 8 of your group before sitting down. Chips and queso are extra... because they are made fresh I'm told. We got our order and all three of my chicken Items had very little taste. We asked for some salsa hoping it would add some flavor and guess what? That's another 5$.... because because it's made fresh so they have to charge. This is not at all worth the time, there are much better options around."}
{"text":"Not sure about the 5 star reviews here.  It's good, possibly the best you can get in Pittsburgh right now, but I've been to a number of authentic Mexican restaurants across the southwest which would put this place to shame."}
{"text":"It's not possible to put into words how good the tortilla soup here is!"}
{"text":"I'm not real big on Mexican food, but Los Chiludos is a place I will return to! It's a cute little hole in the wall that has an excellent staff. At the time I was there, around 6pm, it was pretty crowded and loud, but it's not a huge location. Very good and comforting food! I ordered the shrimp tacos which had a little kick from the dijon salsa, but SO delicious! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the rice and beans on the side were so good, AND I HATE BEANS! Definitely recommend Los Chiludos."}
{"text":"I spent the first 25+ years of my life living in Texas, so I have a very high standard for Mexican food... and Los Chiludos is tremendous.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find good Mexican food and, for the most part, that's been true in Pittsburgh, but not Los Chiludos.  I've had almost everything on the menu and have yet to find anything that isn't delicious.  Their fish tacos are great and their burritos put Chipotle to shame.  If you're ever in the Canonsburg/Southpointe area and only have time for one meal... this is the spot."}
{"text":"Best Cali-style Mexican food in the burg, clean dinning room,professional knowledgeable staff,very fair priced,wish there was an option for 6stars"}
{"text":"Literally the best Mexican food I have ever had.  Not Tex Mex, but real fantastic authentic Mexican food with a cornucopia of flavors.  I have travelled from Mexico City to Bangkok to Rome to Reykjavik and flavors here are as good as any of those places.  Its worth drive from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia or Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I came here after two people suggested it to me knowing that I love me some authentic Mexican food. It was unfortunately not as good as I expected. One of the very first things I base my opinion on is whether their salsa is good and whether it's on the house. I was not impressed by their salsa at all. It had little to no flavor for it being the medium option. 

For my meal I got a frozen margarita and the fish tacos. The fish tacos were fairly good. It had a nice flavor and it was just the right portion for me. Wasn't super pleased with the margarita either because it didn't seem like it had tequila in it. If it did it had very little. Being that this place is a little bit of a drive out of my way I probably won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Los Chiludos is a great place to get some classic mexican food.  The salsa is top notch, and I think they feature other salsas seasonally.  The chips are a little thicker than I prefer, but my husband loves them.   The food is very tasty and better than a chain mexican restaurant for sure.  If you like spice, try the mexican hot sauce they provide - very good! We've been here quite a few times and have not been disappointed.   One thing to note is they are not open on Sundays."}
{"text":"This was by far the best Mexican food I've had in this area.  Everything was so fresh tasting.  I ordered chicken fajitas and got a large plate with beans, rice, grilled chicken peppers and onions, lettuce, pico, sour cream and guacamole.  The tortillas came in a foil packet and were steaming hot.  They ask if you want mild or hot salsa and the mild is very good!  It tastes like fresh cilantro and tomatoes.  I loved every bite.   

Another diner had the steak fajitas and shared a bite.  He loved them but I thought the steak was a little tough. I'll stick with chicken next time. 

The place is small, and the walkway to the door is narrow so the place gets very loud.  The open kitchen is a nice touch. It's Interesting to watch all the people cooking.  The service was very friendly, but a bit slow.  I didn't mind that though.  We went on a Friday night. I expect longer waits on busy nights. 

I hope this location does well and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten take out, but would love to try the drinks and sit to enjoy the atmosphere sometime. The food is always amazing- I love the salsa verde chicken enchiladas. The chips are my favorite and they give you ALOT of guac when you order take out. Only downfall is it is a little on the expensive side, but definitely worth it if you're really in the mood for some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Update: Can I just reiterate how much I love this place. We've been here more times than I can count and it's never disappointed. EVER. Food is always fresh and delicious. Although their limited menu hardly changes, they do offer specials that are unique dishes not found on the menu. Los Chiludos will always be our go to Mexican restaurant.  

Just happened to stumble upon this gem on cinco de mayo when our regular Mexican restaurant had an insane wait time. This obviously was our first time here but will not be our last. EVERYTHING. WAS. ON. POINT. From the food to the cheap but delicious margaritas. Although we did wait maybe 20 minutes, it was definitely worth it. The menu was condensed for the occasion and I cannot wait to try the full menu. We started out with fresh guacamole and chips for an appetizer. For our entrees I had the fish tacos and my boyfriend had beef enchiladas with salsa verde. The food came out quick with fresh ingredients made to order. The flavors were not lacking! We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Maybe 4 stars for Canonsburg, PA but this is a long way from A-OK.  I don't know what I was thinking when I left my 2012 review.  Maybe it was just better than it is now but the last couple times I ate here I was sorry.  The place smells like old oil.  It's really poorly ventilated.  The pork tacos are greasy and taste like the oxidized oil they spray on the flat top heavily.  Blech.  The chicken is tough, dry and flavorless.  These aren't good tacos.  They aren't even average.  They've done nothing with the beans they come with either.  The food is bland.  The oil they use isn't good for you and they use too much.  It's just poorly executed all around."}
{"text":"I love this place.
I lived in California for 2 years so I've had really good Mexican food and I love this place!
Best Mexican restaurant in this area.
If you are looking for good Mexican this is the place.
If you are looking for a fancy place to take a date, maybe try somewhere else.
It's pretty casual."}
{"text":"Californian Mexican all the way. But if you're stuck in your cheese and sour cream rut, they've got you covered as well. The service is quick and kind. There are no bad menu items at all. Keep up the great work, cooking from the heart!"}
{"text":"This could easily be a 4.5. Fresh, interesting dinner options. I had shrimp tacos and they had plump tender shrimp with a zingy sauce. Order is for 2 with rice and beans or 3 with just rice (get the 3). Mrs. Reviewer had the steak fajitas which were easily enough for two (or for one with leftovers) and the steak was delicious. The space is a little cramped and noisy, there is some limited outdoor seating. Chips and salsa are great but they should be as they cost $4.50."}
{"text":"Well, not the best Mexican food I've ever had. I will say that the service was excellent and all of the workers were very pleasant. Also, the military discount is a free chips and salsa so keep that is mind.  We ordered the cod tacos and a carnitas burrito as well as the chips and salsa. Overall we keep mentioning that the heat level in every dish was very mild. Super mild, way too mild.  It was the most bland tasting Mexican food either of us have ever eaten honestly. Each dish was cooked well but the taste just was not there for any of them.  Have to say we won't be back. Just not our cup of tea in the taste department unfortunately."}
{"text":"Alright, I know one star is harsh, but the food here is the least authentic cuisine I have ever tasted. Sure where I live has a large Spanish population, so we get some pretty decent grub. Regardless, the food is bland, the rice had a weird flavor and you can get similar offerings out of your local grocers' freezer and not leave the house. Sorry, wish I could say better."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh hands-down! Would be nice if there was a wait staff as you can get stuck in line placing your order for a long while."}
{"text":"My title says it all.  I love their chicken burrito and chimichanga.  My wife always gets the steak quesadilla.  All three are amazing.  Great authentic ingredients.  Very tasty.  This will cost more than any other authentic mexican restaurant out there but it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Go to Mexican restaurant. I get it almost every week! I can't attest to any meat beside the fish but the fish tacos are the best around!!! I am so happy it's right down the road!"}
{"text":"Chiludos is my pick for the best tacos in town.  I have gone there at least 20 times in the past year simply because I know every time, my tummy will be happy!

Chips and guac plus queso.  Their chips are crunchy and a bit thicker than your average chip.  Guac is basic and does the job without any addition of lime, tomatoes, etc.  Get some with your meal.

Tacos, what can I say?   Chorizo continually on point with the right amounts of spiciness and meat.  The carnitas, carne asada, shrimp or fish tacos - you just cannot go wrong here.  The plates arrive hot and meat is never dry or overcooked.  I like 'em with extra onions and cilantro, topped with their hot spicy salsa.

Lastly, finish that deliciousness with either a beer or a Mexican soda.   

Just a quick note about service, they could do a little better on speed and timing as on several occasions we had to ask for the whereabouts of our food!  ;)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Authentic Mexican food and great prices. I had the steak tacos. The steak was juicy and cooked perfectly. My friend ordered the burrito, it was huge! She said it was delicious. I wish this place was closer to me. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Time to update.  Stop in Los Chiludos every once in a while.  Always get a good meal.  They have a few specials on the chalk board and I always look at the menu while in line because I try different items every time.  Recently stopped in and the special was Shrimp tacos.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and tasty.  Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"They moved to Southpointe!
Upside: no longer hidden, plus plenty of parking; more seating, clean
Downside: now in a plain-Jane suburban office park strip center.

Authentic, reasonable (our dinner tab for 4 people was $44), and most of all-DELICIOUS.

I've had their carnitas (pork) tacos and the Sopes (with chorizo). Love both, but if they have not sold out of Sopes, which they had on my first visit, I highly recommend them. Two Masa cakes smeared with thin layer of refried beans, them crumbled chorizo, cilantro, cheese. So addictive. I must have put my fork down 8 or 9 times.

Random notes:

you must purchase chips and salsa. Variety of excellent salsa to choose from.

On entree, they only have mild or hot salsa choice. The hot one does not mess around! Seriously hot (for me). Mild is a verde, which I love.

Service is fantastic. You order at counter, are given a number to put on the table, then servers will deliver to table."}
{"text":"We biked from Robinson to this place along the montour trail for lunch. Was delicious and worth the trip!  Had the hot salsa which was flavorful and delicious.  Would classify it more as Med than hot but there are always options to give it more of a kick if wanted.  Got the Cod fish tacos with were outstanding with the mango salsa and cabadge slaw. I will be back, probably in a car."}
{"text":"My wife thinks the food is \"too smoky\". It's definitely different, but I like it... alot. I love their chicken tortilla soup. I always get the chilanga burrito, so I can't speak about other dishes."}
{"text":"I visited Los Chiludos during a recent trip to South Hills Honda - that is to say, I never would have found this place otherwise. From the fresh chips to the variety of homemade salsas to the cold beers to the focused, well executed menu, I was very pleasantly surprised. The carnitas is the best I've tasted since we left Arizona--and, the overall flavor profile of their food is as authentic as it gets. If authenticity isn't your goal, then the extremely reasonable price point (as it relates to the sheer volume and quality of the portions) should be enough to make this your next lunch or dinner destination. I personally plan to go back...every single time we service our Honda!"}
{"text":"Loved this place and their food. It does get busy around meal times, however I tribute this to their great food!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome.  I had the fish tacos and wish I could eat them every night for dinner.  We have also used them for catering and they do a wonderful job.  You get quality food for the price.  Great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This could be the best Mexican food that I have  ever had.  I think they have a gourmet cook back in the kitchen. I wish that it was closer to Pittsburgh. We only stopped here because it was on the way to a play at the Little Lake Theatre in Canonsburg to celebrate my friend's birthday.

Service was friendly and efficient.

Steady stream of customers, so you know it's good, even though it's in an unassuming strip mall.

Salsas with the chips are unique and tasty.  

If I had to recommend two things it would be to lighten up on the salt and build a vestibule at the entrance to catch the winter drafts in the front of the restaurant.  

Thanks for the wonderful, memorable meal."}
{"text":"Slightly different than your regular Mexican restaurant, as it calls itself California Mexican. Great portions with fresh flavors. Kid friendly as well. Small spot but totally worth the wait. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Los Chiludos is a popular restaurant located in a small strip mall with the golf course surrounding it. The place is small with both indoor and outdoor seating. When you arrive you order at the register and you are given a number to take to your table. They only ask you if you are dining inside or out.

Having never seen the prices it took me a while to decide but when I returned the line had doubled in length! I decided to go with the chicken fajitas. It comes with your choice of mild or hot sauce along with soft shells, guacamole, sour cream, rice, beans, and the usual fajita veggies. If you want to order a soft drink or ice tea then you are given a plastic glass to take to their machine.

No sooner than I sat down with my drink they brought my food out to me. They have a sign over the cooking station stating that their food is not microwaved and I was observing the food preparation while I was waiting my turn. Yes, The prepare it on a huge stovetop and grill it.

I thought my meal was average and it was indeed filling. The beans were not your typical refried beans you would get elsewhere. Seemed a bit bland.

Chips are not complimentary here, if you want them with salsa then you would have to order it as an appetizer. This place is open late but it gets very packed around the lunch hour. I would imagine it must cater to the people who work in this area since restaurants are few and far between. Also if you need to be back on the job the food comes out fast so you can be back to work in no time. It is not far from the Southpointe interchange on I 79 so it is convenient location wise."}
{"text":"While visiting my parents in Pittsburgh, I've been to Los Chiludos three times over the past year.
I've tried at least a third of the menu and, for the most part, everything is pretty darn good.  The chips are always freshly fried, perfectly salted, and are thick enough that they don't break when you dip them into guac (a big plus for me).  The guac itself isn't as good as chipotle's (yeah I said it!), but its still pretty great.  The carnitas sopes are awesome, especially the corn cakes, which are on par with the meat and queso fresco on top.  The beef quesadilla is also good, albeit on the greasy side.
Those were all the things I had the first two times I went, but the third time was kind of a let down.  It was lunch time on Christmas Eve, so the regular cook might have been out, but the chorizo chimichanga I had wasn't that good (3 stars).  It just wasn't that flavorful, but it was a great value for the price because its huge.
I still think that this is about as good as Mexican food gets in Pittsburgh and a solid place to go to if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Los Chiludos! I ordered the taco salad and my mom ordered a burrito. They were both huge and were reasonably priced. I highly recommend you add the guacamole to the salad or any meal because it's delicious!"}
{"text":"As close to the real deal as you will find in the Pittsburgh area. When you order tacos, go with the \"traditional\" style rather than \"American.\" It won't be too spicy. Good Mexican food is rarely too hot (spicy)."}
{"text":"Good food. After moving north from Texas, I finally found a place worthy of being called \"Mexican\" food. A bit pricey for what we ordered, but it was all properly spiced and tasty. I recommend the chimichanga with red salsa, which has a great spicy, smoky flavor. The chicken tacquitos were also very good, with moist and we'll-marinated chicken and fried nice and crunchy. Definitely worth going back to."}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to its reviews.  Everything was delicious, the service was good, the price was right.  The only complaint I have is that they have really weird hours.  Sometimes they're not open for dinner, and when they are, they're only open till 8.  But you know what?  That's ok because when the food is that good, the people will go get it no matter what.  I so look forward to going back.  I'm super excited that I found an excellent Mexican place that's close to where I live, now that El Paso is so awful."}
{"text":"We came here with friends a few weeks ago and it was AMAZING. Its in the middle of a shopping plaza in Southpointe, and its a true hidden gem.  I got the shrimp volcano bowl that was full of big grilled shrimp, veggies, rice beans and some kind of special sauce that pulled the whole bowl together. My husband got the beef tacos and he said they were the best that he ever had.  We returned last night and were disappointed. We ordered the same things since it was so good the first time. My volcano bowl barley had any sauce and there were no veggies.  My husbands tacos came with 3 tacos the first time and they were covered in cheese. This time he only got two and there was no cheese. I will defiantly return but I will be sure to discuss my concerns when we place our orders."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. The person who I assumed was the manager took care of us the whole time and was very personable.  She recommended the California burrito which had steak, guacamole, french fries, and queso in it. It was delicious and the steak was tender. Their guacamole was some of the best I've ever had. I really can't complain about the experience. The food came out extremely quickly and we got in and out.  Will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"Not bad for lunch but try to not bring children.  We ordered food and then was told they only had one highchair and had to wait 35 min for the highchair.  By then are food was cold and we wanted to kill each other because our son was ready to leave."}
