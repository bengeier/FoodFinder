{"text":"Very nice place for a high tea sorta thing. Dad and daughter sitting, drinking tea, reading. Food takes a while because it is all home made and fresh. I had the salmon eggs benedict. Very good. They have a kids menu. Very friendly staff who even gave us sample tea to take home as well as free dessert because they felt bad that we had to wait so long. Expensive, but tasty."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea.

I found the service lacklustre and the food unpleasant in taste and presentation. Good thing the company was good or it would have really ruined my day."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. I come here with lady friends when we need some time to chat and catch up. We always do the High Tea service. The little sandwiches are delicious and fresh. The scones and cream are always so moist and flavorful and of course the petite desserts are to die for. I LOVE the lemon tarts. 
It is about $25 for a pot of tea and the food per person. You either each get a single pot of tea or one large one to share. Each person gets about 5 mini sandwiches, one large scone and 3 desserts. I always go for the house blend tea because I think it is absolutely delicious. Black tea with hints of caramel. 
I do not eat any red meat and they have no problem changing out the ham for another sandwich. I also have a friend with allergies and they are able to accommodate her as well. Just call ahead and let them know! 
I always feel great leaving the place as they have a wonderful atmosphere and are always so pleasant. I keep bringing more of my friends here to try it when I want to have High Tea. 
The only thing I would say that is a negative is that they don't have high-chairs and a friend of mine has difficulty getting her travel chair to fit on theirs. Perhaps it is best to leave the little one at home! 
Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place :)

Very homey environment, quiet, very relaxing, friendly staff, awesome tea and snack. We ordered high tea for two (a bit expensive, definitely not something you would do everyday), but the sandwiches and scones are exquisite. The portions didn't look like a lot but we couldn't finish and had to take some desserts home. 

My personal favourites are cream cheese cucumber sandwich and the scone, their salmon mousse tart was very interesting! Too bad we both forgot our phones at home, the presentation was very cute!"}
{"text":"Doves nest is a real gem!!! Cute d√©cor, great food, lovely service and overall just a wonderful little place. Went for a friends birthday tea and had the best time with friends in a lovely relaxing atmosphere. The older lady that I believe owns that place and makes the wonderful little tea sandwiches even came up to our table to say hello and to ask how everything was which was so nice and she is a lovely woman. If anyone is looking for a fancy yet relaxing high tea experience or if  you just need a cute brunch place I highly recommend Dove's Nest :) We will all be coming back for sure! Thank you again for a lovely afternoon. Grateful customer!!!"}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a month with my mom; it's our favourite place to meet up! Their soups are out of this world (particularly their tomato basil), and all of their food tastes fresh and doesn't feel heavy. Our go-to meal is the chicken salad sandwich on multigrain with a side of soup. And their desserts... The coconut cream pie is to die for, the Bakewell tartes are sweet, a little tangy, and utterly delicious, and they've got a huge brownie topped with whipped cream and ice cream... Wow!

Their Afternoon Tea service is a great treat as well; you get a three tiered tower of treats and your choice of a pot of tea served in one of the beautiful China teacups from their lobby. The bottom tier is traditional tea sandwiches, the middle is an enormous, buttery scone, and the top is a selection of their two-bite desserts!

Their teas are absolutely amazing! I haven't never seen a selection of pure teas as vast as this, and they have a great selection of blends as well. My pick is the Assam Tara Julie with milk. 

There's something for everyone here - you've gotta check this place out! (Just make time to find a parking spot!)"}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced. Not a good afternoon tea experience at all.

Bow Valley Ranche is way better in every aspect except tea variety."}
{"text":"I had High Tea at this place, the service was very good and fast, and the selection of teas was great, there was a list on one side of all the standard teas like black tea and green tea, etc, and on the other side there were more special teas that were fruity, etc. I decided on the vanilla bourbon almond tea and it was tasty.

High tea came on a three tray platter with sandwiches on the bottom, a scone in the middle and desserts on top. I would say the food is so so, there was one ham sandwich with cheese that I was sure had cheese whiz in it, and some of the other sandwiches were a little strange too. Not something out of place from a supermarket deli aisle.

The scone was delicious and desserts were good too. It is a very filling meal considering it's just a few small finger foods! I would recommend this for the atmosphere and the chance to enjoy tea with some girlfriends but don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"Been coming to Dove's nest for the past five years. me and my husband come here for every celebration. we much rather sit here and enjoy scones and tea rather than be in a pub. She has the world's great coconut cream pie. It is absolutely to die for. Love Gale and her team!"}
{"text":"Lovely to find a spot in Calgary that offers high tea, but I think it is slightly overrated at The Dove's Nest. You get your own pot of tea, and sandwiches, a scone, and dessert squares--typical high tea fare. Where I think it falls short a little bit is that the sandwiches are not \"to die for\" and same with the dessert squares. The scone is the best part, but even then they serve it with jam and whipped cream (not clotted/Devonshire cream which is the traditional ways of serving scones, so a bit disappointing if you are expecting a true high tea). They do have a very large selection of loose leaf teas, but I wish they had a bit more description of what the flavors are like. Love all the unique teacups they have on the tables... Drinking tea out of a teacup just tastes better! :)

As another reviewer said, the decor is cute but feels a little Grandma- esque. It can also be very busy and we were kind of smushed into a corner of the restaurant. Not the best ambience but it's a sweet spot. Our server was pretty awkard which also detracted from the experience. 

In terms of price point, high tea here is $31.95 whereas high tea at the Fairmont Palliser (much fancier, luxe location) is $37.50. Thinking next time I will try the Palliser for high tea; for a few more dollars I think the nicer location would be worth it and I hope they serve their scones with clotted cream!"}
{"text":"Doves Nest figured out how to use high tea as their cash cow to milk customers by offering very little for a high price. I don't deny that the portion sizes are generous, but at $30/person, I could stuff myself multiple times at a good quality cafe or bakery. 

The cutesy, humble decor, and the impressive 3-tier tray display are smoke screen and mirrors for the fact that their food isn't any good. Their scones are enormous and difficult to eat. It was also super dry and to top that, they serve WHIPPED cream on the side. Where's the traditional clotted cream??

The sandwiches were OK at best and had very little filling and was mostly bread. The pastries tasted homemade but weren't anything to write home to your mom about.

On a positive note, the service was great and so was the tea selection. 

Hopefully there will be more high tea options in Calgary in the near future. Doves Nest should rename themselves to Pigeon Hole, because they corner you into paying an exorbitant amount for carelessly-made food. If anyone asks me to go to Doves Nest again, I'll say screw that noise! Might as well drive to Banff for quality tea at the Fairmont."}
{"text":"Back in Calgary, I decided to go to the Doves Nest for brunch with friends.  I must say, my experience was much different this time.

Once again, I had the scones covered in seafood and cheese, and it was quite tasty and fully filling again.  

This time, our server was nice, but a bit inattentive.  When we went to sniff the tea jars to determine which tea to order next, we were told we could not.  If we wanted to sniff the tea, the woman had to hold the jar and fan the air over it towards us.  I was extremely put off by this, partially by her attitude, and partially by a stranger waving their hand that close to my face.  If people smelling the tea is such a problem, why don't they have a rack with sample tins, specifically for smelling?  I can only assume this girl was new or something, or the management hasn't been to a Teopia, a Steeps, a Oolong... heck, any other tea house with more than five choices of tea."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential tea place where you catch up with your girlfriends over dainty tea sandwiches, lemon tarts, cakes, scones buttered with cream and sugary jams galore while sipping yummy exotic tea flavors from around the world - with one pinkie up in the air, of course! The ambience is warm and cozy, like your grandmother's kitchen yet stacked from wall to wall with lovely porcelain teacups and plates, cannisters of tea and silver teapots served with smiles by the gracious staff. Truly, a place we always love to come back to. Much better selection of afternoon teas and menu than Fairmont Palliser's, definitely. Don't wait too long!"}
{"text":"I had a planned a special day with my daughter and it included high tea at the Doves Nest.  I was excited since I heard good word of mouth reviews.  This is my first high tea and I was impressed.  My daughter received her own special plate of goodies plus stealing some of mine (which is expected, haha).  Everything was good.  The quiche and the scone were my favorite.  I'm not an egg salad fan but the pickle in the middle was a good addition.   A larger serving of  jam for the scone would be greatly welcomed as well.  I tried the Assam bukhail  (not sure of the spelling) tea and it was great for a random choice.
I found the service good."}
