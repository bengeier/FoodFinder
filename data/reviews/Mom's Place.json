{"text":"Really good food for the price, and you can tell this is real food, prepared on the spot; nothing here is prepared out of a plastic bag like most big name restaurants do these days.

Feels like a classic diner with a bit more class. The waitress and cook came from a classic diner in fact, Bev and Donna are originally from the Blackfoot, which is so old it's a heritage building.

I was impressed, I will be back again, and again!"}
{"text":"Food is good, nice portions for the price, just like an old time restaurant (without the looks) where they talk loud amongst each other.  Service could be better and faster though considering it wasn't very busy when i went."}
{"text":"Friendly diner. Went for lunch, had a cheeseburger. Will go back and try some other things. Good service"}
{"text":"I was starting to like my breakfast basted eggs and bacon, with multigrain toast! Potatoes were burnt but added flavour! As I was enjoying my dark yolk eggs, eeek a hair!! I got a new breakfast but totally turned off now! I really liked it here! Servers are nice and wonderful, but I can't get past the hair!! Shouldn't they wear hair nets??
Replacement breakfast was good, I ate it, but the dilemma I now have is should they charge me?? Should I tip?? I enjoyed the service but ticked at finding hair!!  I want to come back. Would you??? Like the coffee, like food."}
{"text":"Good breakfast in the hood, only other place around here is either Denny's or McDonald's a&w. food came out quick. service was real friendly. good spot"}
