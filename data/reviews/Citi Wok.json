{"text":"looks like new owners.   many meals are different. asked for chow mein noodles and got spicy chicken.    not saying bad at this point just different twist on each meal.  a little pricier too.."}
{"text":"The food and service is soooo good! The food is fresh and filling. Will be coming back"}
{"text":"Cheap Chinese food. You get lots of carbs and not much veggies/meat. I would recommend Asian Cuisine over this place."}
{"text":"At last I found a decent place to get nice crispy egg rolls, perfect Chicken Balls with ample chicken inside, AND bacon fried rice with real bacon!!! Mmmmmm good! Nice friendly service and reasonable pricing. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because I haven't sampled other items on the menu yet. But I will definitely be back weekly for sure. Also, there was a table full of FireFighters enjoying lunch when I entered. Now you know the food has to be GOOD to attract those heroes in uniform!!"}
{"text":"Decent place for Chinese Take out. I ordered the chicken balls with rice.  Good, fresh taste.  Rice was cook well. Price was very good for the amount of food. Will come back again."}
{"text":"All in all I had a good experience at Citi Wok.  What I noticed first was that they were friendly, and service was fast.  And the place was very clean.  The gentleman that brought me my food was also spending time tidying tables, replenishing supplies on them, and generally making sure everything was inviting.   I also thought the food was pretty decent.  I had one of their combo meals; and there was certainly plenty of food.  The rice, beef with vegetables, and the spring rolls were all cooked well, and tasted great.  The shrimp, on the other hand, was cooked within an inch of its life.  Still tasted okay surrounded by batter, but definitely way overcooked. I'll definitely be back, but next time I'll try something that doesn't include shrimp!"}
{"text":"The taste and price of this place has changed since I last reviewed it, and it's definitely not for the better. Price went up, while food quality went down. There are alternatives."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese fast food place (lots of my friends in Aurora love here as well)there's a small eat in area super casual:what most people are used to when they think of take out Chinese food places. Food is always fresh n hot. To South Americans this is what we are used to (except for some canadianized things like chicken balls) they have some Cantonese dishes. Wide menu,nothing surprising or out of the ordinary.Chicken fried rice,beef low mein, boneless sweet n sour pork,beef ho-fan noodles(either stir fry in soy sauce or black bean sauce),jar-do chicken wings,general Tao chicken,Singapore curry noodles,spring rolls & of course chicken balls are my usual order, sometimes breaded shrimp. Their batter is always fresh n crisp not soft or soggy. I give this a 4/5 stars because sometimes they put too many onions in some of the dishes( but most Chinese restos do this to \"stretch\" food costs) so they are not the only villains in this practice. I have their food once a  week."}
{"text":"Not returning to this place. There are other places that do Chinese food way better. Look around Aurora you'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Aurora by far.   Tried all of them pretty much, and nothing compares.  Great lemon chicken, and the best lo mien.  The wings are all incredible, from the honey garlic to the delic ja doo.  The prices are average, and the food is always hot and so fresh.  Recommend them to all friends and family, and no one is ever disappointed.  So yummy."}
