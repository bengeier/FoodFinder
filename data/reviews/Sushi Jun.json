{"text":"If I could give a zero rating, I would. My husband and I ordered sushi from these guys, specifically asking for no 'crunch' as I'm a celiac and can't have wheat. They still managed to mash up tempura into the roll, which now has me in agony.  Buyer definitely beware, minimal ingredients listed on their website or menu."}
{"text":"A solid 2.5 stars, and as it says... \"Meh. I've experienced better\". Sadly, I am not feeling the same as my fellow yelpers. Tonight was my first visit where I got the wonton soup, spicy California roll and green dragon roll.  To start - the wonton soup was one of the worst I had. I live for wonton soup so I've tried many, but for $4 I got two soggy dumplings, a whole lot of cabbage and weird mushy stuff in the broth. I don't eat cereal with milk because I hate mushy things so I was instantly a bit grossed out.  The spicy California roll was better. It was sort of spicy, as it should be, there was a good ratio of crab and avocado, but could have had more cucumber. Also, the seaweed was on the outside which was odd. I could taste the seaweed more than if it was inside with the rice outside (like 95% of the other restaurants). Not sure about the flavouring, but it was chewier. Also I ran out of soy sauce after the 6 pieces of sushi... definitely not enough given.  Finally the dragon roll. The avocado was good, and it wasn't too large like some restaurants. The tempura was yummy, so props for that. But after I got my own soy sauce, I ran out of wasabi after 4 pieces... so they really cheap out with their condiments.   Overall, I don't think I'll be rushing back. It's nice this place is open on Sunday's though, as most places are closed in Newmarket on this day."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Newmarket so far! Although not the cheapest, it is definitely worth the money. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is the most consistent sushi in the area.  Same staff always there remember your name, you can get a roll combo with soup and salad for under $10! Try their different salads and soup and other rolls.  Fresh and quality is always there, skip all u can eat and go here"}
{"text":"Although it is a very very small little Japanese restaurant but it is by far the best sushi I've taste from there! This place mainly target on rolls and their rolls are soooo good. Prices are a little expensive but they come in a large quantities that you can barely finish a lunch combo. I love love love love this place"}
{"text":"Third time here,  and once again the food exceeds expectations!  Sushi is best in Newmarket,  fresh fish and great tasting rice! Seaweed salad amazzzzzing!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff, ramen is great with a tasty broth, rolls exceed expectations, not your average lame AYCE roll."}
{"text":"This is one of the great sushi places in Newmarket. Located on Main Street, it's close to the trails if you want to grab lunch and sit by Fairy Lake.   They are mostly a take-out restaurant but have 8 seats to dine in. There is no bathroom (which the waiter will tell you if you decide to dine in).  They have a wide range of combos, rolls and meals from bento boxes, to ramen, to sushi sets.  I opted for the spicy tuna/spicy salmon set for $9.50 + tax - which came with a soup and salad.   It was delicious. The rolls are a good size and there is a good fish to rice ratio. The salad was a basic garden salad with a tangy dressing and the soup was a miso soup.   The fish tasted fresh and it was the perfect balance of rice to fish to spicy sauce ratio. I would def. come back!"}
{"text":"Sushi Jun is DELICIOUS! Always friendly service (both owners remember me even if I haven't been there in a long time), and ALWAYS fresh! They don't have \"all you can eat\" but the prices are extremely reasonable and there are a couple cafe tables to sit in if you want. I usually call and my order will be ready for pickup within 10 minutes, but they also deliver to Newmarket and sometimes Aurora if your order is over a certain amount (I'm not 100% sure, $30 maybe?). I would highly recommend trying the place out! I still drive the 15mins to get it even though there are lots around me, I'm spoiled now!"}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese restaurant.  Food is great and owners are really friendly.  Only one table for two but I do enjoy eating in a chatting to the owners."}
{"text":"Beyond excellent sushi. Their bento boxes are really amazing too. They also just updated their menu with a couple of newer items. Very good and will go back a lot for something like lunch. Reasonably priced also even with the minimum wage increase."}
