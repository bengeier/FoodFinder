{"text":"Really enjoyed my time at this brewpub. Good drinks, comfortable feel with a warm environment. This place is amazing to stop in after walking through he hustle and bustle of the strip!"}
{"text":"If you like good beer, this is the place. If you are looking for Miller Lite and a football game, not so much.  They know their beer and it's good to boot. Do a flight and sample a few."}
{"text":"Great beer and great people who work here. Easily my favorite brewery in PGH. When the pgh public market was still around I used to fill up my growler there all the time. They're not too expensive for really great beer."}
{"text":"I really love this strip location for East End. The d√©cor of the inside is very clean and feels rather upscale for the location. There is a very large bar on the inside, and some table seating around it. Draft list is also displayed very clearly, which is nice. I love East End's beer so much, and however simple it may be, I love watching them make and seal the crowlers right in front of you. It's so neat."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable atmosphere and staff. Very nice selection of beer, unique glassware, and diverse selection of goodies for purchase (t-shirts and stuffs). Drinking Along Came a Cider and C.R.E.A.M. now. Making us happy on a spring day. Wonderful place to stop after a big meal at Primanti's, which is just a block down."}
{"text":"Delicious beer and great service all in a fantastic location.   East End Brewing company is one of my favorite local breweries. I'm a big fan of the Monkey Boy, Snow Melt and Fat Gary - but you can't go wrong with any of their options.   The taproom itself is a great addition to the Strip District. Its tucked into a side-street, so its always busy but never crazily packed. And even when its crowded the good folks behind the bar keep things moving.   Do you want a relaxing Saturday morning/afternoon? Shop through the Strip District collecting your favorite treats (pepperoni rolls, cookies, sandwiches, etc...) and come to East End Brewing Taproom for a lunch and a few drinks. The taproom won't mind you bringing in outside food - in fact, they encourage it!"}
{"text":"Super nice space with great lights that remind me of little baby hops. Loving the 6oz beer flights. Drunken Nunkin Ale is a light pumpkin taste - very welcome in a sea of heavy handed pumpkin spice. Pint glasses totally reasonable too."}
{"text":"Great beer, great atmosphere. Kind, eager service. Simply a great place to relax or create positive vibes with a pint (or few). Recommend their Big Hop and Fat Gary. Prices are fair, if not a few cents or dollar cheaper than comparable microbrews."}
{"text":"Great spot off the main drag in the Strip District to stop and have a beer. They offer tasters of three 6 oz pours for just $10! Their pints are definitely affordable at just $4-$7 each. Lots of options for everyone's tastes! Growlers are also available to take home too! Jordan was very helpful and made great suggestions!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Thursday evening for a couple of beers. This is a great little beer bar that serves some nice taps brewed by this brewery. They have about 12 beers on tap. I had a Hefeweizen and an IPA. Both were really good.   There's no food served here, just beers. There's a pretty big bar and then some tables. There was just one very friendly bartender.   Prices were good and during happy hour they take a dollar off. I paid just $9 pre-tip for my two excellent beers.   It was a very friendly, nice experience and a great place to stop at if you're in the Strip District.   One note:  the restrooms are in the building, not this bar, and require a code that you punch in. The code was 153 when I was there."}
{"text":"So checking out the breweries in Pittsburgh we came across this place on Yelp. Tried walking in but we thought the door was locked. So we walked down the street to a bar and had a drink, then coming back we saw people inside. Turns out the door sticks so you have to pull hard. Man did I waste a drink at the first spot. This location was fairly new but they've been brewing awhile. Tried a couple samples and ended on the Green Giant. Man it was the perfect beer for a hot day! This place is only going to get more popular. I will defiantly be back on my next trip to the Burgh!!"}
{"text":"East End has been and still remains one of my favorite local brew pubs.  They continually make beers true to style and are always willing to explore rare styles.  They make a consistent line-up of beers, with plenty of year-round staples, one-offs and seasonal brews.    The taproom is located on 19th street after moving from the Pgh Public Market.  This location is a thousand times better.  Very clean and open space, not quite 'sterile', but definitely modern.  A flat screen TV is propped up over the bar displaying the 20 or so beers they have on tap or available in bottle.   Lots of styles available, Pale Ales, Oatmeal Stouts, Belgian Style Witbiers, Hefeweizen, IPAs, brown ales, barrel aged brews...etc (plenty of options).  The bar area is large, plenty of seats around the bar and lots of standing space behind the bar.    If you are looking for a nice little refreshment from craziness of the Strip District, look no further than East End's Taproom."}
{"text":"I wish I could say that I enjoyed the beer offerings from East End but I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed.  These beers did taste strong with a lot of bitter aftertaste to it.  I didn't get much in terms of the fragrance/aroma from their most popular Big Hope IPA.    I do give them points for their friendliness and the time to explain a little bit about their brand.  The decor inside the taproom was your standard taproom wood theme with stool seating at high tables and at the bar.    I know that I didn't get a chance to try some other beers during my time here hence the average rating but I hope that the next time I come here, I'll have some more time to do either a sampler/tasting of multiple selections or to have another pint or two."}
{"text":"Love this place. BYOF. We grab lunch from somewhere in the Strip and come here. Always a relaxed atmosphere. Makes drinking beer a little too easy. And my kids love the root beer."}
{"text":"On a hot day, the Berliner Weisse is a gift from the gods! The taproom just opened a few days ago, but on a Sunday afternoon there's already a decent crowd. Still, it's not too busy to quickly get served.  There are a couple of outdoor tables, and plenty of room inside. Come grab a beer!"}
{"text":"From of the best craft breweries in Pittsburgh, this is a convenient tap room in the Strip.  I'm a huge fan of their Snow Melt, and I wait every year for it, but they have other reliably great beers like Big Hop.   The tap room fills growlers, plus they provide a comfortable place to sit and relax with friends.  Their new discussion series, Between Two Fermenters, is very cool, and an example of how the local craft brewers work together and support each other. There are other events, like trivia and also yoga.  Service is friendly and fast. Space is clean and attractive."}
{"text":"I was pretty sad when I heard the news that the Pittsburgh Public Market was closing- one of the big reasons is because I loved going to the East End Brewing Taproom there! I guess it was a true blessing in disguise, because now East End Brewing has a gorgeous, larger, and more comfortable taproom in the Strip! Their beers are incredible- I love their Snow Melt, as well as their IPAs and really everything they make (I'm a huge craft beer lover). You can sit down and enjoy a draft, or you can purchase a four pack to go, or you can take a crowler home with you or a growler! They have all of the options. I haven't actually sat and had a beer here yet, but I am planning to do so ASAP. Last time I visited, I purchased a four pack of Snow Melt (ran around $15 for four pint size cans). You can't purchase their beers in other beer stores around the burgh, so hop on in here and try some brews and take some home!"}
{"text":"Decent beer, okay atmosphere.  Not very memorable though, I wouldn't put effort into going back."}
{"text":"I love the new space! It is great to see several of the businesses from the Public Market find their home in the Strip District. The renovations are beautiful and it is spacious enough that you could go with a group of people. Plenty of beers on tap to try and they have growlers, howlers, and big cans to take beer with you!  Tip - if it's a quiet Sunday, don't assume they are closed. We walked by thinking they weren't open because it's kind of hard to see in the windows. Glad we tried the door because we sampled some great beers and got to see the space!"}
{"text":"I don't drink anymore but still enjoy the view from a barstool perch.  This has a wonderful bar, sited in the strip.  It is also quite enjoyable for the non-drinker in offering their own root beer which is delicious.  This section of the strip is filling with establishments that have recently moved in and offers some interesting new stops in this already rich stomping ground."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some Saturday afternoon beers with a few friends. Ordered a flight of three beers.  Went with the Pedal pale ale, Monkey Boy Hefe, and Barrel Aged Steelcut Nitro stout. Pedal and Monkey Boy were ok.  Not bad, but wouldn't go out of my way for them.  The Barrel Aged Steelcut was a different story.  I noticed that the Alcohol content was only 5%, which is extremely low for a barrel aged beer. I wasn't able to take more than 2 sips because the beer tasted like you were licking the inside of a barrel and that was it. I believe that most beers of this style are much higher in alcohol content so that flavors from the barrel do not dominate the palate like this.  It was the first time in a very long time that I had to set an almost full beer back onto the counter on the way out.    Otherwise, the space was nice.  Plenty of seating and the branding was pretty sharp.  They also have a crowler machine to grab beers to go.  I kind of like that format a lot when I travel because it lets me take home a draft only beer without having to buy or lug around big glass growlers.  Lastly, the location is perfect.  It's right off the main drag of the Strip district.  I'd recommend this place if you're in the area and aren't too picky about your beers."}
{"text":"All the greatness of East End Brewery but located in the Strip!   A lovely open space with cool \"hop\" light fixtures, this definitely should be on your to-do list if you are in the area.   Great beers and great vibe.   Average cost of a beer $5-$5.50 which in my book is a great value for passionately made craft beer.   My only gripe is that there wasn't any Commonplace cold brew coffee on tap like at the brewery location but it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"This brewery is in a very cool building.  I was with a wine drinker and one perk is that it is connected to a place that serves wine.  The wine place will let you bring East End's beer in, but East End will not let you bring wine over.  I ordered a flight, which came with 3 beers.  I got a brown, a hefeweizen, and another light beer.  Unfortunately, these beers all tasted very \"home brewed\" to me and nothing stood out as spectacular.  The building is an old brick building, but I feel like the brewery could have done more as far as decorations or making it have a cool ambiance.  There's definitely potential here!"}
{"text":"I was SO happy when this place opened! I used to get growlers at the Public Market all of the time and was very bummed when that place closed down.   If you're in the strip, trying to watch the Steelers game and drink some IC Light, go to any other bar. If you If you enjoy a chill atmosphere and great craft beer, check this place out! I love the location, the decor, the beer selection.   This place does not serve food, but is considered a \"BYOF\" so you can bring food in and eat while you hang out.   This is a great local company that focuses on sustainability and low waste. And great beer!"}
{"text":"We always make it a point to stop here when visiting the strip district. My husband loves their beer- big hop is his all time favorite but he's never disappointed when he tries something new. I personally love the monkey boy and I'm looking forward to having it again now that I'm not pregnant. While pregnant I started judging a place based on their nonalcoholic options and I loved that East End offered old fashioned sodas. They are delicious although a little sweet. I can't drink more than one."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in The Strip and the perfect place to pop in and get a beer... or two. Place is well lit, but cozy and there are a good number of seats around the bar. Between the bar and high top tables, plenty of places to hang out.  Bar tender was knowledgeable in recommending brews we might like and service was quick.  Love supporting local breweries like this one!"}
{"text":"East End has fantastic beer. This is a great place to have a pint or grab a few growlers to go. I highly recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"Love East End Brewery. Not only is the beer excellent, but they really contribute to the community. They have a beer called loaf made from stale bread and the proceeds go to 412 Food Rescue. They host a number of different events both at the brewery and taproom. And they support other Brewers and Chefs. Unfortunately, the Taproom is closed Mon, Tue, and Wed which is a bummer."}
{"text":"Place was ok......table we sat at was a little dirty.  Beer was nothing special.  Bartenders very friendly and cordial"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a late lunch. The bartender was really nice and knowledgeable about their beer and just beer in general. The space was really open with beautiful tables and bar and exposed brick. We were listening to the bartenders Spotify and when my boyfriend commented on who was playing, he asked if there were songs in particular we wanted to hear.  They don't serve food here, just have bags is pretzels and chips, but encourage you to order in or bring food back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in town for a wedding. The wedding party had a fabulous website built and included things to do while in town. We strolled over to The Strip on a sunny Sunday.. get it.. had lunch at a nearby establishment and then followed that up with a visit to EEBT!  We were promptly greeted and had a seat at the bar and were given a menu. Scrolling through the list of what was on tap, we asked for a couple sample tasters before we settled on a couple pints.  Two frothy pints of Wheat Hop and Fat Gary were in our hands and away we sipped! Those we our two favorites. I liked a couple of the PA's and IPA's, but I settled on ol Fat Gary because of his low ABV. Next time I'll probably go with something a little stronger.  In the famous words of that one guy... \"All be bock!\""}
{"text":"Very nice setting; friendly environment. The menu had a lot of options and the brews were great.  The downside of the experience is that we weren't greeted as we entered nor were we asked if we have been here before. We sat down at the nearest table and waited for 7 minutes before moving to the bar for a drink.The staff was very unconcerned with our party.The barista was extremely rude and when we asked about a happy hour, she seemed annoyed and did not want to serve us. The website still currently reads that there is a happy hour 5-7."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed East End's taproom in the Strip District! Went with a group of about 12, and the taproom was packed by the time we got there. We were able to get a corner spot at the bar and started ordering.   East End had a ton of taps rolling, I think at least 25, so there was something for everyone. The best finds of the day were the PA Handshake IPA collaboration beer and the Chance A'Shahrs IPA. They also had several cans for sale as well as crowlers and growler fills. Absolutely worth the stop if you're in the Strip!"}
{"text":"Made a stop here while at the strip district. Friendly bartender and cool glasses to buy. Worth making a visit to!"}
{"text":"Great brewery in Pittsburgh.  This location is their tasting room.  All of their beers are very good.  My favorite is the \"PA Handshake\", it is a milkshake IPA made in collaboration with Pizza Boy brewing in Harrisburg.  I ended up taking some home with me."}
{"text":"Really like East End's taproom in the Strip District. A brewery is exactly what the Strip has been missing. Stopped in with a group of four people and could easily sit at the bar. I loved their sour and ended up buying a four pack to-go. My boyfriend doesn't love IPA's, but found a few beers and a cider he enjoyed. He's a hard sell, so that says a lot about the quality and variety they're offering at this location.  Worth the stop if you're browsing the Strip."}
{"text":"Been awhile since we visited and took the tour.  It was all good.  Great staff -- folk who actually do know about beer and its brewing.  Wonderful facility.  Parking on a busy day is a bit dicey... I think East End is the model for a locally grown, owned and successful business.  Scott is simply a nice guy who figured out a niche and grew a business into it.  Roy"}
{"text":"Great place to get some good local beers.  There's a decent amount of space - all hightops, and they're in the process of building an outdoor area which looks like it'll be very nice.  The bartender was helpful and friendly.  Great for a group.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cool place. Definitely worth checking out if you a) like beer b) are in the Strip district.   It's super clean, spacious, and well lit. Gotta agree with other Yelpers - their hop light fixtures are the coolest. Talk about serious decor goals!   The bartender was really nice and attentive. And did I mention friendly too? She was chatting with us the entire time. Two thumbs up for awesome service.   They have a large selection of beers to choose from. The beers are very reasonably priced, most ranging around $5-6 bucks. They offer growlers and crowlers for take out. They also have light snacks (such as chips and pretzels) and other goodies (tshirts, glassware) for purchase.   The waitress also informed us that you can bring your own food and eat it there!"}
{"text":"East End is one of the local leaders when it comes to breweries. One of the front runners whose products boast longevity. With so many beers and breweries popping up, East End stays on their A-Game. The new tap room is roomy with a large bar. Bartender was super happy, friendly and sweet. Of course it goes without saying the pours were delicious. We did a flight of Chocolate Cherry Stout, Green Giant and Along Came A Cider. I recommend all three."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! I don't get over to their East End location as much as I'd like because I'm in the south end of town, so I'm glad they opened this location. They have a beautiful bar with additional table seating. So the great thing is you can grab a snack in the Strip somewhere then eat while drinking a delicious East End beer!  My #1 is always the Fat Gary. It was my first beer to drink from here and it never gets old to me! I've had a bunch of seasonal offerings and really enjoy the snowmelt in the winter and I just had a fantastic sour beer. Act quickly for their seasonal brews because they really don't stay  on tap long.   You can also purchase growlers and crowlers. If you don't know what a crowler is, it's basically a 32 oz can that has a pop top. So it's great if you don't want to commit to a fuller growler, or want to get a variety of beers. Just remember once you open it, you gotta drink it (I'm sure that won't be a problem though!).   They have a huge patio in the back that I'm excited for them to open up. It will seriously be one of the best patios in the Burgh, I promise."}
