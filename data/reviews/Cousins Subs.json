{"text":"Absolutely awesome! Met the owner he was great. The food was delicious! Its a small place so I can picture it getting crowded really quick on a busy lunch. But overall the store was clean, the staff was friendly and funny. My fiance and his dad went back 2 days later and the guy remembered them and their order! They had only been open 10 days as of Saturday and seems to be off to a good start. Kinda tucked away and not many signs on the street to them. So if you know where Kohl's is at 53rd and Bell they are in the same parking on the East end. We will be back thanks guys :)"}
{"text":"I've had cousins subs before when I was younger and for some odd reason I was craving for it the day after New Years! They were a tad slow that night and decided to close a little early, and I came just as they were closing, but still let me order. They were awesome! Had a club sub with fries (I love their fries) and a drink, didn't take too long, food was great! Customer service was even better!!"}
{"text":"Moved from Wisconsin to Arizona a little over a year ago. And Cousins was one of the sub places I missed. Driving around the city I drove past this Cousins and immediately told my family we had to go. I must say I was a little skeptical but It didn't disappoint. Easily head and shoulders my favorite sub shop. The freshness of the ingredients to the fantastic Italian bread makes Cousins great! Kim I want to thank you for bringing a little Wisconsin to Arizona!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Subway until I reluctantly went to Cousins Subs due to it being closer to my office. I will tell you what, \"I will never eat at Subway again\". The staff is \"SUPER\" friendly here at this new location and the inside is kept very clean. I now eat there all of the time and would highly recommend the Chicken Cheddar Deluxe with BBQ Ranch dressing on Garlic Herb bread."}
{"text":"Fantastic owners, staff is very friendly and the bred is always fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Inferior meats used on sandwitches, looked like they buy meats from.the dollar store,used to be a lot better,.cheap, lousy meats, waste of money, go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"As a former GM in Wi myself I still love cousins and wish there were more in the valley. Subs are 7.5 inches not 6 like subway. Don't compare to subway, cousins serves real Italian bread. It is firm with a crispy crust. They way bread should be...."}
{"text":"Stopped by around 1 pm for a chzsteak. Plain with mayo, mushrooms, onions and chz. Exactly how I ordered it. When I looked at my receipt, no plain was listed. Cashier went on break so I waited and waited. Only 1 person behind me got her cold sub first. My chezsreak arrives wrong. I told the kid that she rang it up wrong, he still apologized. So now I wait again, no chzsteak ever takes this long. Owner came out and have a free sub coupon, appreciated. But my chzsteak, totally over cooked the meat. Too bad the grilled onion, mushrooms and Italian bread were delish. Cashier was still on break yelling at her phone in the bathroom. Better eye on details and efficiency."}
{"text":"You only have 1 chance to make a good 1st impression. Your front of the house needs some help. After asking me 3 times my order to go was still wrong. Asked for no mayo or tomatoes. There was so much mayo the sandwich didn't even taste of anything other than mayo. This was not a prep issue this was an ordering issue. They couldn't print a receipt because they had the paper loaded wrong. They got that fixed just as I was leaving with my order. After I got home and found out how screwed up my order was I realized that it was because it wasn't taken correctly in the first place. You have been open for a month, you should be running smoother than this. Good luck I probably won't be back. There are many sandwich places competing for my $$$, I am not sure that Cousins will be in the mix. Sad because I think their quality is probably pretty good, but if you can't get an order right I am not gonna like it no matter how good it is suppose to be."}
{"text":"Great customer service on the phone and in person. Consistently tasty subs. Love this Cousins in Monona!"}
{"text":"Had Oregon Area Chamber of Commerce Bucks (gift certificates) and tried to use one at this business. They tried to make us use the entire certificate, noting they are not allowed to make change. I then asked for a store credit for the remaining balance.  They said no.  After hours of back and forth with employees and management, I asked again about a store credit and the clerk said I could use the remaining amount to purchase a gift card.  How is this different than a store credit which they said no to earlier?  So we took the gift card instead of change and instead of the store credit and used it at another location.  They have nothing on the gift certificate nor posted in the store noting no change given, which means their argument cannot legally hold up about no change."}
{"text":"The subs aphere are decent and also are available for a good price. The size you get is also very nice, just a perfect amount. The bread they use is yummy, but it is just a normal sub, similar to milio's and other fast sub shops."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice now and each time the subs were delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Plus, cheese curds! My favorite sub so far was the Philly cheesesteak. Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"I tried to eat here but despite having posted hours saying til 9pm and the open sign still on, the door was locked at 8:30pm. I spent enough of my lunch break getting to and from your place of business that i was unable to go anywhere else for lunch. You have permanently lost my business. Sincerely, Starving with 6 hrs of work to go :(  PS this should be zero stars but i was forced to choose one."}
{"text":"First off let me say this review is not directed towards the Cousins Subs Franchise, this is solely intended for this particular Store and Owner.  A long story short after placing my order I forgot my debit card after the transaction. I had already left the store by the time cashier noticed, so they give my card to the Manager.  The Manager then took it upon herself to use of my card on her own shopping spree a long with a friend of hers. She later then admitted to Mesa PD during an investigation and being seen on video about using my card. She was arrested and charged. Now one would think that this would be a terminal offense, but apparently it is NOT at this location. I stopped by the other day because I still enjoy Cousins Subs and to my surprise there she was, still working for Cousins Sub as a Manager. I just turned around a left.  UNBELIEVABLE."}
{"text":"Great subs and great deals at this location. Perfect for student. 15 inches for under $6 and much better than subway."}
{"text":"Good sandwich for what you're buying. Definitely better than subway! Low prices and good daily specials. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Sandwich was OK. But what ticked me off was that there is a kids menu, but no high chairs or changing table. My toddler had sit on my lap to eat and anyone with a toddler knows how difficult that can be. I went to change him before we left, but there was no changing table to be found either. And I wasn't about to lay him on the bathroom floor (eew!). So I had to change him while he stood up. And because he was standing he managed to pee all down my leg and on the floor. Awesome... Seriously, in my opinion, every restaurant should have a changing table and high chairs"}
{"text":"Great Place and the only one in chandler. I think we need to replace half the subways in chandler with cousins subs. They messed up on my order a few times but didn't hesitate to fix it."}
{"text":"I just had the best service in this type of restaurant that I have had in a long time. Both the cashier and the person preparing the subs were so friendly. The subs were good too."}
{"text":"Got philly steak sandwich, it tasted good. Bread was alright . Nothing great about the sandwich. But, wow the portion size is really small. I left the place really hungry. It's less than subway 6\". Not coming back! If sandwich was bigger and filling, I would give it 4/5 star. Not to mention Tea ran out and had to use lemonade for refill, that I hated all night!"}
{"text":"We had just finished a round of golf at Vista Verde, and were heading home, when we decided we were hungry. So we decided to stop at Cousins, and get some sandwiches to go.  This is a little sandwich shop similar to Subway. However, you do not get to choose your ingredients for your sandwiches in an assembly line manner.  Their main selling point seems to be the price and their different types of breads, and quality of ingredients.  Nothing special, and not the best sandwich shop in the area.  But it was good, fast, filling, and convenient."}
{"text":"I'm on a low carb diet and I didn't think this place would be able to help but I ordered their BIG DADDY sub and they happily put it in a salad bowl! It has over 70 grams of protein and I was thrilled. Tamra is always friend and very helpful. She remembers people and their orders and I'm impressed with this Cousins Subs. I haven't been to others so I can't speak for all of them but this will be my regular lunch take out for those busy days. I just call and order!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. Owner is very friendly and always pleasant, the food is always fresh. They probably should be in a more visible location and they would get more foot traffic. The min-subs are a perfect size - half a sub is still way too much food! Nice place."}
{"text":"Ohhh Cousins. You never cease to make me happy. I moved here from Wisconsin a couple years ago and I was surprised that there weren't any Cousins. This location is really great! They have Sprecher root beer (which I can only find in WI)! My favorite is the roast beef sub with the french fries-which you can subsititue for chips at no cost! The place is really clean and the staff is very friendly! We met the owner, who was very nice! He is also from Wisconsin, which is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I was in here on Sunday afternoon, and the staff was polite and friendly.    The food tastes SO much better than other chain sandwich shops.    I typically get the small tuna sandy with lettuce, tomato, onion, oregano and a little olive oil.    The roll at this store is always fresh, and coming from this East Coaster, that's key.    Great place for a great lunch.    Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Coming from the East Coast, I never had Cousins prior to living here.  This was a store that was close to home and I was looking for something different one night.    They have a pretty good selection of types of sandwiches.  I favorite the turkey subs.  They do have a few specialty sandwiches that you won't see regularly anywhere else (Memphis Steak), and their main selling point is their fresh flavored bread.  The food tasted pretty good, it isn't a high class restaurant so I wouldn't be expecting something better than the Boars Head taste.  I definitely like their bread over what Subway has to offer  However, the only reason why I would rate this lower than subway is because of corporate.  Because of them, Inconsistency occurs.  This location used to serve Gyro meat, but because it didn't fair well in another location, they decided to take it out of the menu.  The specialty sandwiches change not because of poor sales here, but because of poor sales in another location.  Just imagine if Mcdonalds took away their Quarter Pounder cheeseburger because it was selling as much as it did in Mesa or Goodyear, way to show faith in your product!  Corporate is also the reason why this place will not offer toasted subs and limit their hot food.  A good thing is that the staff on deck is friendly.  These guys are awesome to talk to and cool to know."}
{"text":"Fill out a survey on line and receive free fries/ bag of chips & a drink with a purchase of a 7 1/2\" sub. Yum-O"}
{"text":"My latest visit was NOT the best. It started out with me using a coupon (buy 2 subs,  get one free from Madison entertainment book. ) The employee took the coupon and spent about 90 seconds reading every little detail on it as if he was trying to figure a way that I couldn't use it.  Then after accepting it, I paid for it and was hoping to use my loyalty card. I chose this location over two others to add stamps to my card.  They stamp your card for every sub that you buy (buy 12, get one free). But the employee refused to give me any stamps, even though I purchased two subs at regular price.   Fine... no big deal, I got to use my coupon.  Then after taking my order,  the same gentleman went to put on gloves and assembled my 3 sandwiches. I found it weird that at 5:20p (dinner time) on Saturday,  they only had one person working. It just made the wait that much longer.   To top it off, I asked on one sandwich to have extra mayo and banana peppers.  Well, no luck there either because it had no peppers and light on mayo.   So long story short, this was a one star experience, especially compared to all the sub restaurants out there. But because I have had decent experiences in the past, I have it at two stars. So much for being a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much I couldn't even wait to leave before writing my review! The staff is hard working, kind, and very helpful if you find yourself unable to decide on a sandwich. I had the chicken, bacon, and guacamole sub. It was very delicious! It's in a very convenient, clean, and safe location. I walked a 1/2 mile here with no issues. One of the best lunches I ever had!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  When I worked in the area about 8 years ago, I enjoyed this Cousin's location and went there 1-2 times a week on average, for many years.  But I then moved away for anotehr job.  Well, I'm back baby, and I decided to give them a visit (once again, I work right down the street from this location).  I ordered a Turkey sub with double meat ($2.00 extra for the extra portion of Turkey). And I like cheese on my subs (they don't include it unless you pay to add it). So I added it.  That made the sub alone (no drink or chips) come to almost $8.00, but it's worth it to me IF it was a good sub.  It was so skimpy!  I barely saw the turkey, so I confirmed if it was double meat.  The woman at the front (not the friendlies bunch of ladies behind the counter, btw) said yes.  I was shocked, as I can't image what the regular non-double portion would be? She didn't offer me a different sandwich, a refund, or anything.  I felt like a fool who was duped, and quickly left with my dinky sub.  There are way to many other places to go, especially for a sandwich or sub, who give you more for your money and show theri appreciation for their customers.  What's sad is that this Cousin's is so close to work, I would have easily gone there at least 1-2 times a week, as I did way back when, but I vow to never go back.  I refuse to be taken advantage of again.    What's sad is that because they are so skimpy on the meats (and the air conditionaing- it wasn't very cool inside) they will lose customers like me and in the end do less business and earn less profits for theri efforts.  They need to see the bigger picture and do things the right way.  Goodbye Cousin's subs on Washington and 48th.  I won't miss you..."}
{"text":"Last week I ate at Cousins Subs for the first time.  There was a stash of buy 1 get 1 coupons at work.  I nabbed one and went to check 'em out.    I ordered the meatball sub and the Italian Special sub.  Both were delicious.  My only complaint was the restaurant itself was a bit on the grimy side.  The floors were in need of sweeping and mopping.  But if I can let that slide in a Mexican joint then I should let it slide for a sub joint.  The service was good and my sandwiches were made in timely order.  It was good eating.  So much so I went back the next day for lunch and then ordered again for dinner.  A coworker called in our order for delivery because we can't leave.  My sub was a-ok but his was royally butchered.  When he called they were not eager to bring him a new sub.  He let it slide but they shouldn't have given him any trouble about it especially since we're a 5 minute drive away.  If it wasn't for that I'd give this place 4 stars because I really liked my food but they should have made the order right for my coworker."}
{"text":"Great simple and fresh tasting subs.  I'm from WI where these places are popular and they are just as good here!"}
{"text":"Cheap sandwiches...not to seem like a snob in writing but the décor and menu say it all. This is one of those places I would eat at if there weren't any other options. The food was very mediocre and I'm not sure I would trust the cold cuts. Sorry Cousins...I enjoy you as much as Port of Subs...which is not much."}
{"text":"RIP Cousins.  Unfortunately this chain is getting shorter and shorter.  Cousins has the best subs  I've had anywhere in the 15 years I've been eating there (multiple locations) .  it's all in the bread. DON'T LET THIS CHAIN CLOSE!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now where they closed over an hour early and just locked the door with customers inside and refused to even acknowledge the people outside.  Worst customer service I've ever seen.   Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Being from WI I love Cousin's subs. The staff here is really friendly. I don't think the bread is as fresh as back home and my sandwich didn't look that great. It did taste good so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Weird place. The only lights on after sunset are red. The staff are rude. All of them. Always. It's like the soup nazi if he sold sub par sandwiches with the ambiance of a cheap brothel. No thanks."}
{"text":"I work very close to Cousins Subs and I really like the owner and staff.  They have the best tuna by far!  Also the best bread.  I can go anywhere to get lunch but when I want something healthy and very good I head right across the way to Cousins."}
{"text":"Used to go to this place back in the late 90s.  Their italian sub was one of the best deli sandwiches I've tasted.  No matter how crowded it got service was brisk which kept the line moving.  Not a lot of other good options in the area besides the usual chains."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING !! I had lunch there yesterday. Half way through there was a hair in my sub. It looked like a pubic hair. I took up to the manager and he offered to make me a new one. Since he was the one who made it in the first place I respectfully declined. How about you guys where hair nets or beard nets. I will not go back to this place again."}
{"text":"My husband and I always skip the lines and order online. This makes it so much easier, the manager even has us memorized by name and order.  Always pleasant service and great sandwiches. Our favorite is the big daddy, I like to add hot pepper relish. Delish."}
{"text":"Had a terrible first experience at this place. I arrived at the store 10 minuets before closing time. Employee was a young male and EXTREMELY rude. He locked the door 5 mins before closing time to prevent any more customers from coming in. As soon as we got our food and sat down, the employee rudely asked us to leave at 8:07. Never going back to that store again."}
{"text":"They always have good food and know how to move through a long line quickly.  My favorite is the Turkey.  While their prices are slightly higher than Subway, the quality is substantially better.  At least I know I am getting real meat here, and the bread has good flavor.  At Subway, that is questionable at best.  I recommend the Turkey with Jalapenos and a bag of Baked Chips on the side."}
{"text":"Is this place under new management or ownership?  I have been a weekly customer of this location since we moved to the area in 2011.  The customer service is beyond terrible at this point...rude employees, slow, wrong orders, etc.  A few weeks ago I had my wife pick up our sandwiches because I refuse to go back in this place and so she could see for herself.  She couldn't believe how rude the young female employee working the register was to her.  We will now be going to another Cousins location."}
{"text":"It's OK.  I like Subway better but when we have a coupon I will visit here."}
{"text":"I been to other Cousins locations and been treated to a better experience for sure. The team - aka disengaged employees - were not even remotely happy to be at work or happy to be of service.   Table was dirty - cleaned it myself. The employee with the no joy blank look at the counter just watched.   The featured Wisconsin sandwich - \"we're out of pretzel buns\" - was so-so. Edible. Filling. That's all. Nothing at all like the image on the menu.    Delivery - bad.  Not a 1 star OMG bad - just basic all around bad.   With so many other choices in the area, this will be my first and last visit."}
{"text":"ordered the lunch special, mini ham n cheese on parm, fries and drink. parm bread seemed day old. sub brought out with no oregano. I asked where is the oregano? she immediately took it back to add it. fries hot and delish. why is quality always an issue here?"}
{"text":"Simply the best subs over all the other places. Unfortunately, all the other locations have gone out of business,  because no advertising is what I believe to be the reason. If I am in the area, I pick up a sub, I don't even need to be hungry. I don't want to miss out on any opportunity to have cousins."}
{"text":"I'd go there more often if the prices were lower, but you get what you pay for.  This place puts Subway to shame."}
{"text":"Ok, they have cheese curds!! What delightful surprise last night. I had a coupon for buy two get one free sandwich, so I stopped by. Super friendly staff greeted us as we walked in. Clean dining area (it is new after all) with enough seating.   The service was a little slow, but they kept a conversation going with us so that helped pass the time. My hubby got the cheese steak and they cook it right in front of you, so that also explains why it takes longer than subway. Better quality. I loved my turkey on parm bread - delicious! The bread is outstanding, not too thick or overwhelming.   But the cheese curds... who would have known! Not the best, but better than Culvers! They also have fries! And then of course the standard sandwich shop chips and soda.   Would highly recommend - give em a try!"}
{"text":"Ever since they redid the management etc a few months ago my experiences here have been great. Consistent with food orders. Subs are always delicious and the cashiers and employees are super nice. :)"}
{"text":"All bread and lettuce on my cheese steak, barely any meat. This place has fallen hard. So disappointing. Was once one of my fav. lunch spots. Also, customer service is trash now. Lady there, that looks like a man, never made eye contact with me the entire time she took my order, nor when she served my food. Obviously not happy with her life."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of cousins. I love their bread and their curds mostly, but the service is ways friendly too! This location doesn't have the subway type set up - they just have you choose a sandwich that has specific toppings on it. You can always add/subtract items from it though, just not as easily. They also offer online ordering here, which is cool.  Look for a coupon in the mail. Lots of BOGO!"}
{"text":"This is the first and last time I will ever eat cousins sub I asked for steak melt and employee said I wanted philly cheese steak then I proceed with my next order Wisconsin brat & bacon I was told limited time sandwich I ended up with Wisconsin brat & bacon on wheat sandwich."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get... It's a sandwich and nothing special to justify the price. You get more for less at other chain sandwich places. Other than that, I have no complaints about the service received or the condition of the establishment. My first and last trip to Cousins Subs due to small subs for $$$."}
{"text":"A regular lunch spot for me, I generally prefer Cousins over Subway.  Cousins has seven inch half sandwiches (as opposed to Subways six inchers) and for some reason, that extra inch really makes a difference for me (I can't upgrade to a whole sandwich because that's too much).  I also enjoy the fact that you don't have to specify yes or no for every single sandwich fixing, which is a major annoyance for me at Subway.  The employees are friendly and they have all the regular goodies that you might expect (e.g., fresh-baked cookies, chips, etc.)."}
{"text":"One of Last 4 Cousins in Arizona. What a shame. Ive been going to this chain since the '70's. Always a great Italian Sandwich. Bread is the bom. Spices, flavors and freshness you cant beat. The owner is a great guy. Very friendly and knows the restaurant business. Happened to be in area and was very satisfied. Only a 40 mile hike from where I live.  Thanks for bringing back the memories of Milwaukee where they started. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but this outlet earned it.  Slow service.  Average to poor food, mixed up order.  Best 2 parts: really good fountain root beer and a clean wash room.  Come on Cousins, you can do better"}
{"text":"My first trip to a Cousins. Very nice. Super crowded lunch spot, but the order to pick up time was really fast. Had a roast beef and cheese sandwich, was pretty tasty. Remember- Friends don't let friends eat Subway! I'd go here again. Delish."}
{"text":"Random stop this AM as I saw the door wide open and they had decent breakfast deals. Ordered the small egg, bacon and cheese on an Italian roll for under $3. This was a decent breakfast sandwich, eggs were freshly made, bacon was a bit dated, but cheese melted nicely. The bread was the best part overall and it was a different way to start the day, which is exactly what I was seeking today."}
{"text":"Best subs by the capitol. I love the meatball."}
{"text":"One of the best sub places in the valley. When I worked by here, I'd go here nearly every day for lunch."}
{"text":"Look, working downtown means that I have tried the sandwiches at every chain place in town, be it Subway or Silver Mine.  I say with confidence that Cousin's is the best cold sandwich you can buy.  This place is really simple, with about a dozen sandwiches that have lots of meat, good vegetables, and good bread.  The portions are the biggest for the money in town.  Admittedly the meat isn't fantastic, but it is recognizable what meat you are eating.  Furthermore, if you try and get too fancy with ordering hot food etc, you will probably be disappointed.  But, if you are hungry and want a sandwich close to the Capitol, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I've never tried a sub from Cousins Subs until today and I was very disappointed. The gentleman at the register made me feel like I was an inconvenient to him by ordering. Since I've never been, I had some questions. He seemed irritated with me. My friend told me that this place had awesome sandwiches and I was looking forward to my sandwich and was disappointed again. It looked like a sad little sandwich with very little toppings."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service. Never has an employee been so rude to me as a customer in my entire life. I went with a few friends and ordered just a large cheese curds. I was the first to order but both of my friends got their name called before me to come get their order. I went up and asked if my order was still coming and she said \"I called it a while ago and no one came up so I threw it away\". None of my friends nor I heard my name called and there was only one other person in the whole place so could she not have just gotten me or my attention somehow? She then said \"first to order right? I threw it away 10 minutes ago\" and then she walked away. So she even knew who the order belonged to. Normally I would apologize and ask if she was still going to make the order I had already paid for but I was left speechless with the tone she took with me.  I do not think I will ever be giving them my business again."}
{"text":"Tried their  subs for the first time . . The roll was large  compared to the meat . There  were twice as much lettuce as meat . I ordered  a cheese steak sanwich.but it felt like I ate a salad . The price was reasonable"}
{"text":"Very clean and a brand-new location, staff was very friendly and helpful. I planned on stopping by to Dunkin' Donuts to pick up donuts for the office and was drawn into cousins subs got a half-dozen subs, definitely worth it I'll be visiting back again"}
{"text":"my first time at cousins subs - i was looking for a change from subways and this place really delivered on that for me.  the two employees were great to talk to while they were preparing my sandwiches and even asked for my name as i was leaving (a nice touch). i will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes to get a cold sub that was ordered hot. Always have bad experience here compared to other locations.  11/3/17- gave it another shot, even worse. Waited 20 minutes for a chicken cheddar and fries. 3 other people came in and left while i was there. My sub was sitting on the counter for 10+ min and they never said nothing!! 4 employees total in the building and it took 20 minutes to get a sub? Place is an actual joke of a cousins and the management should be ashamed. Horseshit service. They tried to give me a free sub i told them to keep it i dont got time to wait 20+ min for a sub"}
{"text":"The problem with subs is 6in isn't enough but 12in is too much...ha!   Anyway, 7.5 is perfect and a 15in sub split just makes sense which is what Cousins has :)  The subs are yummy, the service is superb. The owner is SO nice, remembers you from last time and is concerned about your food/order.   We love coming here to support this small business owner and his yummy food."}
{"text":"Biggest complaint I had with this place is the cleanliness.  Floor was pretty dirty and the legs of the chairs were gross.  The sandwich was ok, wouldn't run out and get another one because it was fantastic.   I asked for a side of yellow mustard and he gave me Heinz mustard packets which is usually no big deal, but the mustard inside these packets was gross.  I think it might have been way over its expiration date.  I had to scrape it off."}
{"text":"First time at Cousins despite being within one mile for six years.   Tried the Chipotle Cheesesteak on jalapeño cheese bread. It came with thinly sliced beef, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, chipotle mayo and hot pepper relish. It arrived on a soft roll, which is always dicey for take-away.   I normally don't get all the healthy stuff (lettuce, toms or onions) but I forgot to ask about it. It was really good!  The beef was tender and juicy, the spices were spot-on and the veggies offered nice contrast.   I would've preferred a bit of up-sell, since I had never been there. The cashier seemed to want to be done with me tho so I just got the sandwich.   I will try it again, possibly with other choices next time.  I recommend the Chipotle Cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Four words: Italian Special Garlic Bread. Scrumptious. The place is a decent value if you get the large and share. Average sandwich shop decor. Super friendly grey haired owner/manager as well as the one male employee who I swear has been there forever. Always forget to get a coupon. I see them in Airpark News."}
{"text":"Turned into parking lot and there were two ladies on the side of the building smoking. They see me walk in so they come inside. I did not see them wash their hands. Lady who took my order reeked of cigarette smoke.  The combo meal was close to $9. There was not much meat on the bread. Walking out I felt I had been overcharged for a bad lunch.   Before I pulled out of the parking lot the two ladies were on the side of the building smoking again.   Will never go to Cousins again. Too many other sub places to choose from. Even if the price for the combo meal was reasonable the woman just reeked badly of smoke.   Spend less time smoking and more time running your business or soon you wont have a business and you will have all day to smoke."}
{"text":"I normally try not to write one and two star reviews.   I know I may be alone on this one.  Mostly, I feel bad for the owner, or small business person. They have enough working against them, after investing a few hundred thousand on a franchise.  It's simply bad ju-ju, or Karma.  My friend and I came here yesterday for lunch.  It didn't seem all that busy (photo), maybe five or six patrons inside.  It was clean and well lit place.  We ordered the Italian Special (photo) and a Roast Beef.  The sandwiches were okay and the staff  friendly.  We also used a coupon for a few dollars off.  It ran us about $12.00"}
{"text":"went there for lunch yesterday, got a 7.5 Philly cheese steak which was pretty good, friendly service, and the food was just cooked, place is very cleanand organized, nice store"}
{"text":"Was in the area and stopped in for. Cousin's used to be a regular lunch stop for me, but the three that I usually went to have closed over the last few years.  This one is barely acceptable. The place is dirty and the workers are apathetic. Either the whole chain has changed, or this place is below standards. I think that my sandwich had the absolute minimum of ingredients it could've.   I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I moved to Az 21 years ago form Milwaukee. I was not new to Cousins I always liked the Italian Special. I now see that there are less locations and they are not close. I hope you do open more stores. I look forward to eating a Cousins again"}
{"text":"The meat and cheese has me coming back. I am a serious lover of sandwiches. One thing you can do right and other places are doing is having fresh bread and veggies. However, the amount and quality of the meat and cheese is a good indicator to me of the commitment to quality. Why? Because the cost.       Cousins seriously stacks on the meat - and the meat in not thin or watery. The cheese is amazing and full of flavor. Its a great place. Yes, the cost is higher because of it but when I pay 10.00 for a sandwich I don't want a skinny Jimmy Johns bite sandwich.       Now with all that said 4 stars. This location in particular has a crew that needs some management. Some of the guys are good but the few bad apples hit hard."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were going to go to Culver's, we should have. Unfortunately we choose cousins. I'm not saying this about all cousins but this one was dirty, slow and inefficient. We got there and ordered 2 subs with fries and cheese curds. It took us nearly 20 minutes to get our food. Then we had to decide where to sit, which would not have been hard if there were clean tables to choose from. Nearly every table was dirty. We did find a slightly clean table to sit at. There were 4 men making subs and taking orders, it was moderately busy. After the rush left and there was but 3 people in the sub shop the employees made their own food and got themselves drinks and hung out in the back while leaving the tables dirty as well as the soda fountain area. I will say that I will never go back to this cousins, if one at all."}
{"text":"Love Cousins Subs from way back.  The stores I used to go to have either closed or are seriously run down, so I was glad to see this one open.  The employees have always been friendly and helpful and the sandwiches as good as always.  It's far from my house, but every once in a while I'm able to stop by and get a good basic turkey sandwich and my day is good."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches, still, and am happy to see a Cousin's is opening in Mesa on Greenfield/I60.  BUT, this location on Washington... it used to be great and when I worked in Tempe, I'd drive all the way to get that great Cousin's bread.  Stopped in the other day, very excited to get a Cousins Sub.  Place was messy, HOT (in February), they were out of all but 2 types of bread and were turning some customers away who didn't want the regular Italian white bread.  They used to be friendly; not so much anymore.  Cousins Subs is still the best and I'll be visiting the new one in Mesa, but I won't visit this location anymore."}
{"text":"Couldn't go home without picking up my early dinner, BLT on an Italian sub roll. So good wish they were open on weekends! But it doesn't keep me away from the weekdays. :-)"}
{"text":"This is my designated Cousins Subs, always good service, always fresh ingredients. They could be a bit speedier but overall I'm satisfied with them."}
{"text":"So I typically visit the Cousins on Old Sauk. I thought I'd visit this one for a chance as it usually seems less busy since it's off the beaten path. I've always found this one to be the friendlier of the two. Service is great here, the sub always gets made quickly and I'm always out the door in a snap."}
{"text":"This Cousins Subs has a grill, something many of the others lack. I love the fact that I can have fries here, the Philly Cheese Steak is awesome. The employees are always smiling and more than ready to help."}
{"text":"The bread is great here, I only tried this place a few times but it was good one time, and not good the 2nd time.The lettuce seemed to be real wet and soggy, and since they make them in the back you dont really get a custom sandwich.  I will try the cheesesteak sub and the fries because a good cheesteak is hard to find.  Subway has one that isnt bad,ill post another review after I try it.  I will say the place is very clean, the owner is in a lot  and the staff needs work on customer service,overall worthy of a visit, give it a shot and see what happens"}
{"text":"I just love this little sub place. They have the best bread around, nice variety of subs, quick service and nice workers. So glad I discovered this yummy place."}
{"text":"good subs. fresh, quality ingredients. i choose cousins over subway anyday. take the challenge yourself! and did i mention they have cheese curds?!? yummmmmy!! also tried the italian sub and they didnt skimp out at all, big sammich with lots of meat and im a big eater. 3 tries, 3 likes."}
{"text":"Just waited 15 minutes to get the Wrong sub This place is going downhill fast Now I know why SubWay is so busy"}
{"text":"Best place to go for a great sandwich if you are in the area. Their bread is fresh and is way better than jimmy johns or subway. Been going here for years. Their meat and veggies are also fresh. They're located next to dunkin doughnuts near frys at 90th & Shea."}
{"text":"Our sandwiches that night were subpar at best. My kids eat just about anything and even they complained! I literally had 5 pieces of spinach on my sandwich! I've never had a sub that skimpy before. My husband said we will NOT go back! I understand that your restaurants are locally owned and operated but, this makes all of your establishments look bad as a whole."}
{"text":"It makes a lot of sense why Cousins Subs keep going out of business!!  Rudest person (Manager) I have ever met in my entire life!  I was nearby the property, working and this older gentleman comes storming out of the sandwich shop demanding I tell him who I am, what I am doing and then proceeds to yell in my face, demanding I leave the property and calls me stupid in front of customers walking by.  And to think I actually contemplated eating at his establishment and giving him my hard earned money.  I explained to him that I work for Truly Nolen and that I was called out to the property by the property owner at a specific time.  He then continued to tell me to leave and that I am scaring away customers because they think there is a bug problem.  I told him that I am working just like he is and he still continued to belittle me in front of anyone who would listen.  I will now be telling all my friends and family not to eat her and I ask anyone who reads this not to support such rude establishments.  I remember eating at Cousins when I was a lot younger and enjoying it, but now my opinions about this company are the complete opposite!"}
{"text":"Cousins Subs is a Madison tradition.  Something I grew up with and therefore love even if it's not the greatest-- like Rocky Rococo pizza.  Milio's cold subs are a little fresher tasting to me.  Cousins does better on hot subs.  A pepperoni melt hits the spot every time.  So why am I leaving a 5 star review for this location?  Because it is one of the few Cousin's locations that has a GRILL.  In addition to the normal hot and cold subs, you can get Philly Cheesesteaks, pretty good fries, and great cheese curds.  Even the regular hot subs get made on the grill instead of-- I dont even want to know how they heat them up at other locations.  Maybe microwave?  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Drive through is sometimes slow.  Dining room is dismal but clean.  And it hasnt changed since my childhood."}
{"text":"Staff was 5 stars.  Friendly and quick. Food is not as good as it used to be.  I am an old Cousins fan from way back in the day in Milwaukee.   It used to be my go to sub place.   The subs are much smaller than they used to be but the ham and provolone was a pretty good size today.   The philly cheese steak was nothing like it used to be.  It was thin, lacking flavor though the meat was tender.   I wouldn't get that again and it used to be one of my favorite selections.  The bread was good and fresh. Milio's is the best place for subs right now but their best doesn't match with the old Cousins."}
{"text":"This store is understaffed particularly before 5pm.  So much so they arbitrarily close the drive through when it's just too much of a hassle to provide this convenience to their customers.  Hire more people."}
{"text":"At approximately 12:30 PM, my wife and I walked into the Cousins Subs in Scottsdale (90th and Shea), and attempted to use our coupon for a free 7.5in. sub with a purchase of one and a drink.  We were told by the cashier (who later told us he was the owner), that our coupon was not valid.  I explained that it is from the Savearound Coupon book I bought at my school.  It has the location's address printed on the coupon, as well as a certificate number.  He explained that he does not accept those.  I proceeded to say that students are buying those books, and there will likely be more customer's in the future attempting to use them.  He said that he would not accept them, as no one from \"corporate\" cleared it with him.  I am extremely disappointed, as I traveled about fifteen miles from my home, specifically to go to Cousins for lunch.  I passed several competitors, but chose Cousins."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.   Yummy cookies.   Absolutely pass on subway for this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this sub shop a few times.  The subs are well below average.  The only reason I go in here is because of it's proximity to my workplace.  However, I have now been in there for the last time.   I recently went in and ordered the Philly cheese steak.  When I got the sub and sat down, I looked inside and there was hardly any meat.  I am not usually one to complain.  If I don't like a place I simply won't go back.  My wife was with me and said I should go back and say something.   I took it up to the counter, asked them if they could put more steak in the sub.  They said no because the meat is weighed and a sub only gets 3.75 ounces of meat.  I told her to look at my sub as I opened it.  I said my first and last bite will be nothing but bread.  Then she offered to put more meat on the sub even though she is not supposed to.  I said never mind, I'll eat it and just not come back.  At least at subway, for 5 bucks i can walk out of there full....  This place is garbage."}
{"text":"Finally! A cousins subs right in my area!! I've always loved their subs... they're so much better than subways subs! The lettuce is always crisp and the bread always tastes delicious, and this location is no exception from those standards! While I didn't go in myself, my mother did, and they were packed with a lot of people ordering and eating (which is good because I want this location to stay forever!) As Amanda said, the place is tucked away, but if you see the UPS store it's diagonal from there and on the same section of buildings that the 'Beads' store is on. Definitely should go check the place out! It's clean, new, and the staff was awesome!"}
{"text":"Usually I'd give a 4 star review max for fast food joints (If they've earned it) but this 1 gets a solid 5! Not only is the staff great, foods what you should expect from cousin's subs but this location has Sprecher root beer from Wisconsin!!!!! The best because its from Wisconsin. Duh, lol  If you haven't had Sprecher root beer you might wanna get in there!"}
{"text":"Cousins by FAR has the best subs around. Whatever Jared is pushing doesn't come close.  The staff here is super friendly. I'd like to think it's mainly due to the owner being a fellow Midwesterner, but I might be biased ;)  Ordering is a little different than other popular sub shops.  You order at the cash register and tell them up front any changes you'd like from what the sub normally gets.    They have 5 bread choices, and the multi grain is amazingly good.  I'm going to assume it's healthy too... But if I wasn't I wouldn't mind either.  The bread is always baked fresh and the meats and cheeses are nice and cold.   My multi grain was soft and fluffy, without being squishy.    Top it off with a fresh baked cookie and you'll be a happy camper. I prefer the chocolate chip.  I've catered from here also.  I usually speak to the manager and she is very friendly and helpful.  I tell her how many people I want to feed and she makes suggestions of what to get.  The subs for catering come in a box which is easy to carry and serve in the office.  Price point is very reasonable for catering orders, usually $7-9 per person depending on how many salads and chips and sodas I order.   HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Mostly I just go here because it's quick, cheap, and located directly across from my office."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch around 11:30 and it wasn't too busy yet.  Looked at the menu and ordered:  Big Daddy Sandwich (Cappacolla Ham, Coteghino Bologna, Genoa Salami, Ham, Pepperoni, Provolone, Black Olives, Pepperoncinis, Lettuce, Onions, Tomatoes, Parmesan Asiago, Oregano, Oil, Red Wine Vinegar, Mayo), $7.49 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cousins-subs-scottsdale-2?select=5a58W9LHNH6AWP912YWjyg#5a58W9LHNH6AWP912YWjyg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cousins-subs-scottsdale-2?select=kumKHw5gR7_Spho1gQjaBw#kumKHw5gR7_Spho1gQjaBw  Chips & Drink, $2.59 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cousins-subs-scottsdale-2?select=JuQo7zFEAoR4DhL8dk35NA#JuQo7zFEAoR4DhL8dk35NA  The old guy working the register was super nice and suggested that I get the Sandwich cut in half to make it easier to eat.  I followed his advice and it paid off.  The Sandwich is stuffed full of the ingredients and is quite messy to handle.  If it wasn't cut in half, it would've been even messier.  The Sandwich tasted pretty good and the Bread was also above average.  Their house brand Chips were also above average and had a unique taste to them...to me they were almost like Sour Cream & Onion more than Jalapeno.  Overall, a good lunch experience.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Very bad workers didn't listen to my order lied about having a Wisconsin sub planet sub is still better"}
{"text":"Service is super fast and the place is clean. I'll take a Cousins over Subway any day. The soups are tasty and I like the bread for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Staff is consistently ahead of the curve, easy to reach location, plenty parking great food and friendly atmosphere-:)"}
{"text":"I never thought I would give a chain restaraunt 5 stars, but I work close to work.  I find myself going to Cousins because its priced well and usually before I am done paying for my sandwich, its already made for me.  The owner and her employees are always very friendly unlike the zit faced morons at Jack in the box, Subway or other chains.  The italian sub on italian bread is 10x better than any Subway sub.  well there ya go, take it or leave it, if you want a very quick place to grab a sando for under $6 go here!  Visit me if you are looking for a new car or truck at Centennial Leasing and sales and ask for Gary!  My inventory is at www.autobrokeraz.com"}
{"text":"Im sad this place closed. It was a bit pricey, but they gave safelite employee 10% discount and the food was pretty bomb. Their bread is really good (although I wish they hadn't done away with the parmesan garlic bread that was my favorite) and I enjoyed their soups and unique root beer. I think the employees were nice and friendly. Now there is no where to eat as close by to my work : ("}
{"text":"Delicious gyro sub.  The onions were delicious.  Much better than Subway. I was working nearby, so thought I'd check it out.  Im glad I did!"}
{"text":"I visited this Cousins this past Sunday, 12/11/2016. The best thing about my visit was the chips. I am so disappointed... Instead of going to Jimmy John's I decided to go to Cousins instead. My visit started with wait time of approximately 7 minutes. There was a single customer in front of me, ordering only a few sandwiches. But I had patience, I really wanted a sub. My biggest complaint is the basic knowledge the staff lacks. My total was $8.29. I handed the cashier two $5 bills, a nickel, and a quarter (that's $10.30, for the record). She handed me back $0.71. WHAT?! Embarrassed for her, I walked over to fill up my drink and looked at the receipt. Where did she get $0.71 from?? ....She entered that I gave her $9. $9 folks... I GAVE YOU CHANGE!!! So, instead of going to Jimmy John's and spending $10.39 on the combo I normally order, I spent $9.59 on a mediocre sub combo with lousy service (consider that extra $1.29 your tuition to go back to elementary school). I appreciated how quickly the sub was made and I appreciated that it was made how I ordered it (to be honest, I really expected it to be incorrect). When I finally took a bite of my sub, I was disappointed yet again. Can you guys look into getting some fresh lettuce? This is the second time I have been to this location and had wilted lettuce on my sub. But, the chips did not disappoint. If you like chips, choose Cousins over Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"So today I had Cousins Subs for the 1st time. I can say the service was great. The staff did a amazing job at explaining the concept. Service was fast, fun and friendly. He only reason why I did not give the place 5 stars is because my sandwich had too much mayo otherwise pretty good."}
{"text":"I do enjoy the italian bread here, but there isn't enough meat, cheese or topping to enjoy it! I definitely hate to say it but subway is just on the NW corner off the 101 and Shea. Its pretty expensive and not very loaded with toppings."}
{"text":"Great Subs, excellent staff. And try the bottled Root Beer! Outstanding for a fast sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"Tired of Subway or Jersey Mike's subs? Why don't you give Cousins a college try?  I've eaten here 2x now and like their Classic Italian sub - just the right amount of meat/cheese and tomato with seasoned oil. NOTE: Oil *will* leak through their paper \"to go\" bags, so wrap up accordingly.   I am surprised that they use shredded iceberg lettuce, to be honest. I'm very anti-iceberg to start with, but don't you think the Italian would taste better with a dark, leafy like Romaine?  The best thing about these subs is the bread. The taste reminds me of my grandmother's homemade bread and I get nostalgic. :)  I even like their brand of chips - like the jalapeno ones (they could be spicier). Prices are higher, I believe, than Subway, but I think they're tastier."}
{"text":"Took to long to get your food, after waiting for while for my food my sub was delicious."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and always receive great, friendly service. Subs are quickly made and very tasty!  Never an issue for me to come back here again and again.."}
{"text":"Extremely clean store and the staff is super friendly. Subs are always delicious and the bread is fresh! Only place in AZ that I know of where you can find Sprecher root beer, yum! Makes me feel like I am back home in WI."}
{"text":"Cousins subs are awesome.  But the employees at this location are not good.  Every time I come in they are super slow, talking to each other about high school drama or flirting with the girl from the Dunkin donuts.    Because I love cousins I gave this place 4 stars but if I was writing this about the service it would be a 1 star because it can't go lower."}
{"text":"I am a huge Cousins fan and am a pretty frequent diner -- 4 to 5 times per month. One of my favorite things about the subs is the bread -- unlike other chains (Subway in particular), the bread never seems old or crusty or stale. I hate that with Subway, if you don't eat your sub immediately, the bread can start to seem \"old.\" I have never had that problem with Cousins -- I can pick up a sandwich while running errands, take it home and toss it in the fridge, and that bread is going to taste great hours later.   This particular Cousins, however, is disappointing. Between work and errands, I've tried all of the Cousins in the area -- downtown, east side, Park Street (now closed), and this one on the west side. Every time I've gotten subs from this particular location, the bread seems old and crusty, even when I eat the sandwich pretty immediately. The first two times I blew it off -- I went into the restaurant at an \"off\" time (8PM or later) and just thought that it was the end of the night, they weren't making new bread, etc. But now I've gone three additional times during \"on\" times (right in the middle of lunch, when there were several people in the restaurant and ingredients were moving) and I am still finding this problem with the bread -- it seems crusty and old, even when the sandwich was freshly made and quickly eaten.   This is a small thing, I know, and I have no other complaints -- otherwise the ingredients are fresh, the service is good, they are great with special orders, etc. But this bread thing is just annoying and seems strange compared to other Cousins in the area.  I'd suggest asking how fresh the bread is when you order -- maybe that will avoid this problem."}
{"text":"Normally love cousins subs. Went there just for a chicken noodle soup. I was waiting 20 minutes, all they had to do was put it in the bowl. I had to remind them I ordered it and it made me late for work. Very upset."}
{"text":"Ok, I haven't been here since I graduated & stopped working in Union South but guess what?? They still deliver (not physically, just in terms of value so metaphorically)  I could've just been hungry today but decided nope they're just good as I hid out in a little corner of the break room to sneak in my meatball sub. Here's why: Cousin's Meatball Sub is akin to Cafe du Monde Beignets for me.   How so? If you've ever had a beignet (french donut: fried bread dusted in powder sugar but if you get it to go from the New Orleans Original stand on Decatur it's POURED on no dowsting here) and eaten it directly from the to-go bag then you know how to eat in shame but pride all at the same time. What's the connection: their meatballs subs are to be consumed the same way.   First, they are HUGE! Just 4 meatballs but they fill the entire sub bread just fine.  Second, it's actually tasty. Add on some veggies to pull in the flavor (e.g. banana peppers/onions/oregano/bell peppers) it only comes with marinara & meatballs & bread.  Third.. the subs are longer than the traditional 6\" or 12\" I think 7.5\" & 15\"  Fourth: the bread is baked in house and there's at least 4 options (wheat, Italian, Oregano, Parm)  Fifth: there's always a deal 2 for $5.55 or 2 for $5.99 or a coupon somewhere.   All of this and I would never eat compact ground meat. Not even at home. So, Cousin's has won me over. Although this is a chain, the other locations don't seem to make their meatballs & sauce as good as this location.   I started with Cousin's back in 2005 (picture my hand over my mouth as I say that to garble the number) but here it is 7 years later and they're still holding on.   CHASE ATM OUTSIDE THEIR FRONT DOOR They sell chips, fountain drinks, bottled pop & now Krispy Kreme donuts.  Get a free donut with any regular sandwich purchase after 4pm.  BOGO donuts anytime after 4pm.  Soups & Chili as well.   Service: Stellar.  Even today, the young man offered to remake the pickup because I wasn't offered a bread choice. That was touching but unnecessary - no need to waste food."}
{"text":"I like cousin's, its better than Subway, but lets face it, almost anything is. I'll admit that the place doesn't look the be the cleanest, just like the other reviews said. But I didn't really have any problems with the service, but overall it is pretty forgettable. The only reason we went in is because we had a coupon and it was right down the street from our house. Its the first time we have been there since moving two years ago, and even though the sub was OK, I don't see myself going back for maybe another two years."}
{"text":"I had the chicken sub. It was pretty bland, very little flavor."}
{"text":"I'm not really one to write a review on a dinky little sandwich shop in a strip mall, but I have had so many negative experiences at this place that I felt I needed to share them.  The people that work here have been beyond rude every time I have visited this Cousin's Subs.  The first time I came in I used a coupon, which seemed to piss the old guy working the counter off.  I asked to substitute one ingredient for another and was rudely told \"No Substitutions!\"  The workers are always impatient with the customers and always act as if I'm inconveniencing them by being in their store and giving them business.  And to top all off, their sandwiches aren't all that good!  They skimp on all of the ingredients and try to charge you extra when you ask for more.  Avoid this place and just go to Subway.  You'll get a better sandwich without the attitude."}
{"text":"Thanks so much again for great party subs for Christmas. You dud a great job. With everything. We will be back again next year for it but also during non holiday for the great dubs and service. East Washington location was awesome"}
{"text":"I have a sickness and the doctor's have told me it is psychosomatic. I must eat at all chain restaurants once. Don't get me wrong I love good quality food from mom and pops but I do get a warm feeling when I pull up to a chain for the first time. Maybe it is being a child of the eighties and all the advertising. Anyways, work dropped me in Scottsdale and  I have had Cousins bookmarked forever. You know what it wasn't bad. Real friendly service and my sandwich came out quick. Ordered the 71/2\" Club on Garlic and Herb bread. It came with Ham, turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, white onion and mayo with a dash of oregano and spice. I could really taste the oregano and I liked it. It kind of sets their sandwich apart. They do bake the bread daily and I left satisfied."}
{"text":"I would normally reserve a 5 star review for a fancy restaurant but I am breaking that rule this time. The staff is so incredibly friendly and they treat you as if they have known you for years. The bread is delicious and in my opinion, better than Subway or Jimmy John's bread. I am not a big meat-eater, I got the I veggie sub. The veggies were fresh and crispy and most importantly, the cheese was good quality and not that tasteless triangle shaped garbage cheese you get from the 'other' sub places. So glad I stopped in and grabbed a bite. Even got a free cookie!!! :)"}
{"text":"They have delicious bread and their Mayo is one of a kind...  The 2 subs for $5 deal is amazing b/c not only do you get two different subs to choose from, but it is a total of 15 inches as opposed to 12 at Subway.  The service was great, and they had my subs ready in 1 minute.  I love Cousin's."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Ive never met anyone more unfriendly. The employee rushed us into ordering without allowing us tome to look at the menu, when we explained \"sorry we havent been here before\" he said \"but still..\" then my sub was flavorless and cost me more than most sit down restaurants that i frequent. I will never patron a Cousins Subs again."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Cousins before. As a matter of fact, I'm just biding time until my oil change is completed next door at tires plus.  The two dudes working right now are amazing. Professional, polite, knowledgeable, and kind.  As someone who works with college age kids, I lose my faith in the future of humanity quite frequently. These dudes make me believe in the future.  Call me if either of you need a job."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to grab a bite to eat. I must say, I am very impressed by the freshness and quality of the food! I got the BBQ chicken, and everything about it, from the onions to the bacon, was utterly delicious. The bread is the bomb! The staff are very friendly, with big smiles. The only reason I subtracted a star is because my fiancè was disappointed in the menu change since the last time he visited."}
{"text":"So my experience was not very pleasurable right from the start. Ordered a philly cheese steak with a meal. The lady behind the counter asked me \"what kind of bread?\" My selection was unavailable, it happens no big deal. However, when she added on a meal she didnt bother telling me until after the transaction was completed that there ice machine was broke. I asked her if there was any ice in the back she indicated yes, but looked at me in disgust when i asked her for some. Lemonade was not lemonade, just water. And lastly, they put the wrong type of cheese on the sub. It is safe to say I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a road trip from MPLS to CHI and don't really eat fast food too often; however, I was pleasantly surprised with how fresh the food was and how friendly the cashier (Karen) was."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick easy lunch. I work in the area and it isn't the best part of town and so I am picky about where I go for lunch. The staff here is friendly and quick. They make a tasty sub."}
{"text":"Had @CousinsSubs for lunch Tuesday.  The person at the counter was very nice, and gave me the combo price for a bag of chips, even though I didn't buy them at the same time.  That being said, the 2-for-$5 sandwiches were not anything remotely approaching \"a good value\".  The floor had visible mop streaks, likely from already-filthy water, the tables were sticky, there was a large collection of baskets on top of the trash can.  I would not return here unless there was nothing else available."}
{"text":"I was a regular at Cousins off Cactus several years ago, and on a recent trip back home to visit the parents I thought I would stop in here and grab a bite of nostalgia (we don't have Cousins in Denver). I knew I was in Scottsdale when the one woman in front of us in line took 15 minutes to complain to the cashier about how they do things at Cousins. They literally went back and forth for this long because she was unhappy that they do not have a list of toppings anywhere on their menu and she couldn't see what they have like at SUBWAY. I wanted to smack the lady, this place isn't Subway, IMO it used to be MUCH better than Subway!   Finally after waiting patiently and admiring the cashier's cheery nature we placed our order and I had an Italian sub on wheat. I don't know if it was my choice in bread or what, but I really recommend going with one of their specialty breads over something plain because the sandwich just wasn't as good as I remembered them. I might be inclined to go back and give them another shot if I was in the area, but IMO there's much better options a stone's throw away. They had our sandwiches out really quick though so I am giving them 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around! I normally order online and it's always ready, always fresh and the staff is very friendly. Cousin's is my fav sandwiches and this is my fav location!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Was looking for something to break up the fast food monotony of lunch choices.  Decided to try Cousins & to be honest I wasn't expecting too much I just wanted something different.  Since I was a newbie thought I'd try one of their three different cheesesteak sandwiches.  You can make it a combo for $2 extra with your choice of chips or fresh fries cooked to order.  I chose the fries.  Awesome sandwich.  It was so good I went back later in the week and ordered the same thing.  I need to try other items on their menu but I can't get past the steak yet.  This is the closest place I've found in the valley to an old fashioned hoagie joint in Chicago.  Nothing fancy just a good lunch joint. Great staff and they have a military discount which is rare once you get five miles away from the base.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"I felt lazy to drive to a better place to eat, but since it was next door I came here. The staff isnt the friendlyest and the food reflects it. They are very cheap on the amount of meats they put on the sandwich. You get more at Subway, if you want to compare. Also, for what they charge your better off going to another place. If you want a really good sub sandwich, go to Jimmy Johns. They have much better service, food and always have a friendly greeting when entering or leaving there."}
{"text":"Went to Cousins for dinner on a quiet Thursday evening. The guy behind the counter was very nice and the sandwich was great too. The store isnt anything fancy, but I would come here over Subway any day."}
{"text":"Cousins does have good subs.  They market as better bread.  I am a fan of good bread and simple subs.  They just opened this location.  The staff was a bit new, the roast beef sandwich was good, a little too much salt, but a good sandwich.  The cashier couldn't figure out how to ring up the #6, but I'm sure they will overcome.  The location is hidden in the Safelite Auto Glass complex."}
{"text":"Very satisfying lunch! Got the club and it was yummy. Th oregano was a good touch. I'll be back for the delicious bread and very welcoming staff! They're high energy, polite, and funny!"}
{"text":"Best sub shop in Mesa. Owners are a very nice couple. Bread is always perfect. Cheese curds and custom root beer are fantastic. Always stop by here when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Its my 1st time at Cousins Subs stopped by for lunch around 10:30 and it wasn't too busy yet.  My friend ,and I looked at the menu and ordered the Pastrami sandwich and it was good for what you're buying. Definitely better than Subway !!! Low prices and good daily specials. I'll be back."}
{"text":"kid friendly, owner operated, really nice people to deal with. when I want sandwiches on a hot summers evening this is where I go. fresh breads, fresh meat, fresh veggies, and the people are really patient with my children"}
{"text":"Thought it was interesting that I predicted that they would not remain open if they didn't figure our staffing, went by the place this week and they are closed"}
{"text":"I have a long term relationship with other Cousin's establishments, like over a decade of mostly good times, and each store is a little different.  For example, this store serves french fries, and they are pretty good.  I think this location's mantra is: It's better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission.  I've been here a handful of times, and each time I've had an issue arise.  My first visit occurred within 15 minutes of closing.  The staff told me they had run out of bread.  I countered by asking them if they were just saying that because they had just cleaned up and didn't want to have to clean again.  I walked out with only my dashed expectations to satiate me.  On my second visit, I was picking up an order I called in (learned my lesson from the first visit).  But when I passed around my Philly Cheese-steak to the family after getting home, the general consensus was that the meat tasted funny.  One call to the manager (owner) and he remedied the situation, surpassing my wildest expectations.  My third visit was reminiscent of the first, as they were out of wheat bread.  That is soooo annoying.  On my fourth visit, I was picking up an order I placed online.  Imagine my surprise when the staff told me they didn't get that order, pointing to a lonely printer behind the counter sans any printed orders.  I half expected that, but I took the opportunity to besmirch their online ordering process.  Before I walked out, I decided to check the bag to verify the contents, and wouldn't you know, it was missing the cookies.  Now I know what you're thinking... that SOB forgot to bag your dessert... let's kick his ass.  Sarcasm noted.  Its not that I was really peeved, but it is indicative of their attention to detail.  On the drive home, I tore into my sandwich and received another bout of disappointment as my Italian bread was either old or stale.  The owner seems to be a great guy, but he needs to start paying attention and 'get his house in order'.  Contrasting my recent experiences at this location to Steve's Crazy Subs in Gilbert, will have the latter receiving my sandwich business for the foreseeable future.  Steve's track record gets it right the first time."}
{"text":"I try not to leave bad reviews, but I was so disappointed in Cousin Subs I had to warn others. When I walked in there was one other customer and it took them 10-12 minutes to make his order. Come to find out they were hooking him up with sandwiches for free car washes. Not sure how many sandwiches they were making for him....when they finally took our order they made my sandwich fairly quick, but for some reason ended up burning my girlfriend's sandwich and taking about 5 minutes to make it. So we spent close to 20 minutes and only 3 customers were there, and two employees.  I get home and my bread is so hard I can't bite through it and squeezes all the meat and toppings out of the bread. Needless to say I think Cousins will not be frequented."}
{"text":"I have never had a sandwich that so so horrible in my life! I'm a lover of good subs I got the big daddy. The meat was crunchy , the bread was hard, the veggies were sour and the first bit literally made me gag. The meat was so salty and had been sitting out on top of other flavors of meat! Don't ever waste a dime here ! The cashier was super nice but that's it."}
{"text":"Really sorry to see them close and places like Subway with their false pictures of over stuffed subs stay in business. I think the staff caused their demise. Owners have to be on site."}
{"text":"I love good sandwiches and Cousins has a Seafood Sandwich that totally ROCKS.  A couple of times they have been out of the bread I like best, and a couple of times they didn't put much meat on the sandwich.  It really depends 'who' is making your sandwich here, because their two different evening crews give you totally different experiences. I will say that the one crew who 'gets it right' with the more 'generous' amount of fillings makes a TERRIFIC sub and I can't wait to get back and order again.  The other crew is 'hit or miss' and sometimes, like tonight, there isn't a lot of meat on the subs. However, I'm still a fan, and their chips and tea are both excellent.  Try the seafood, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Great Italian special sub on garlic herb! Plus they are usually fast at lunch time!!!"}
{"text":"Being new to town, I stopped here on my lunch hour.  For one, the parking is awful.  Two, you need binoculars to read their menu.  The print is SO SMALL.  The lady at the counter was very helpful, I must say.  She wasn't impatient, just listed the sandwiches.  I decided on a ham and cheese on multi-grain.  I asked for it to be heated.  Service was fast, and I was out of there in less than 10 minutes, I think. Now for the sandwich.  I had to take two bites before I hit the meat, and if I hadn't opened the sandwich, I would have thought they forgot the cheese.  VERY skimpy on the meat and cheese portions.  The bread was okay, but I've had much better at Blimpies and Port-o-Sub.  Not to mention both put a LOT more meat and cheese on their sandwiches.  Not worth the money, not going back.  Sorry, Cousins."}
{"text":"Drove all the way over there and the doors were locked!  The phone number is disconnected!"}
{"text":"I work in Tempe and this Counsin's Subs in quickly becoming one of my favorite lunch spots.  They are quick!  I've never waited more than 5 mins for my food.  Usually my sub is ready even before I get my fountain drink.  I love their cold veggie sub but the one that keeps me coming at night is their Italian Special.  I just don't want it to end.  I get it on their Italian bread and they have little containers with vinegar and oil off the to side that I shake up and drizzle on.  Give it a try if you are in a rush and wanting a tasty satisfying sub."}
