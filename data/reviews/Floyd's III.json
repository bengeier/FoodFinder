{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall in all the best ways.  The food is amazing and the people who work here are friendly and hilarious.  Get the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"My call in order was ready when I arrived.  Stew beef was tender needed more season as the rice was cooked with no season so togather it was a little bland.  But, with a lil salt and hot sause it was good.  The yams and cabbage were seasoned well.  I will go back to try the fish."}
{"text":"My food is always perfect. I typically order the wings with Mac and cheese, greens, cornbread and a slice of chocolate cake with a lemonade.  The Mac and cheese is a little bland, but still good. The service here is excellent. The chocolate cake and lemonade are to die for. This is hands down one of the best soul food places in Charlotte. The service is always great and I like that I can now order online."}
{"text":"Bravo to this magnificent restaurant. A friend introduced me to this place when I told him I wanted authentic southern cuisine. I had the pork chops and they did not disappoint at all. Perfectly seasoned, and perfectly fried. They were not greasy like I've had at other places. The rice and gravy was just as good a the greens came in a very very close third. I am going to rearrange my schedule so I can come back to this place before I have to go back home."}
{"text":"The food is good and everyone is nice accept the lady fixing the plates. She doesn't greet you or smile, she just says,  \"What you want\"? She is so unprofessional she shouldn't work on the front line. She rushes you with making choices and always doing something extra. If I order a vegetable plate and want my mac and cheese in the big part, she says I can't do that, when she is only still giving you only 1 scoop. She put the greens in the main section with all that just and by the time you get home sellers green juice is on everything. Anytime anyone is talking about how good the food is they make sure to mention how rude that cover lady is. Please move her to the back of the restaurant she do not have customer service skills to work in the front."}
{"text":"Local soul food spot near I-85. Very good prices, freshly cooked to order items. Jewel of the Queen City. Always get eating."}
{"text":"I was not impressed macroni was greasy and Yams had a weird Taste. I usually love soul food but this place was not it !"}
{"text":"Omg. So good! I went for lunch today and everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection! I got the Cornish hens, candied yams, and cabbage. It was around $7.50. I'm not sure about the drink though because I got water. If you're looking for somewhere to find good soul food or home cooking, whatever you wanna call it, this is the place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant rox my Sox! And my tummy. I get to come here 2-4 times a year as my terminal is right behind Floyd's. Today I had the stewed beef n mash taters with corn bread dressing n gravy and Mac n cheese. So yummy. And I got so much I have another meal to take home. The staff is super friendly. Thanks for a great meal!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem, visiting Charlotte and had to stop by. The food is awesome and the staff is amazing"}
{"text":"When I get the urge for fried chicken wings, Floyd's usually fills the void. My usual is between the chicken, or the croaker with mac and cheese and collards of course. This is one of 2 locations that remain open. They've had at least 4 locations that I've visited over the years and I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal at any of them. Floyd's seem to remain pretty consistent in the Charlotte soul food arena."}
{"text":"A total fan of Floyd's! I work in the area and love to grab lunch from them during the week. The restaurant is an older building and so it isn't the cleanest or nicest looking location, but what it lacks in curb appeal it makes up in food and service. The ladies and gentlemen behind the counter are always very sweet and help you decide on what and how to order. If you get anything like Chicken or fried vegetables, they come from the kitchen, but there are also casseroles and main dishes on the hot bar up front too. The meatloaf, stewed beef, ribs, and fried chicken breast are all amazing, as I have tasted them! As for sides, Collards, Mac n cheese, Broccoli casserole, Rice n gravy, sweet potatoes etc. All YUM!  I haven't had any desserts for myself, but the ladies in my office adore the Banana Pudding.  I say Try It!! Its so worth it! Home cooking, Southern Cooking, Soul food, whatever...Its good!"}
{"text":"My first 2-3 visits I was excited about finding a good soul food spot. But my last 2 visits helped me to decide not to go back. When I made my selections I had to wait on a fresh batch of chicken wings which was ok, but a lady came to the front from the kitchen yelling back into the kitchen using profane language in front of all of the customers in the lobby all loud(it went on for about 1-2 minutes) about the dropping(into the fryer) of the specific type of chicken and how she was about to leave. Then once I finally thought my order was ready it was someone else's bc they gave my plate away.  Then after telling them what I had on my plate 3 more times for reassurance they still fixed my plate wrong. So I've had my share of Floyd's, I'm good until I find another soul food spot."}
{"text":"Went a few times. Food was very very good, they just need a better building but they say the \"hood\" places are always better."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and definitely one of the better soul food spots I have tried in Charlotte. The food was very fresh and the flavors were amazing as well. I had the potato salad, fried chicken, fried okra, and the Mac and cheese. None of it was too greasy and the customer service was very pleasant."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat in Charlotte if you are looking for a genuine home cooked meal. The fried chicken is plump and juicy. The Mac n cheese is just right. Make sure you try the mustard potato salad. My husband and I have only been here 3 months, but this is hands down the best place we've ate! The service is good and the restaurant is very clean. We will be back soon!!!! We are there on Nov 8."}
{"text":"I will say the food is great but they have the worst customer service very unprofessional slow service and the place needs updating"}
{"text":"This  what you call a whole in the wall and with Excellent Authentic Soul Food, couldn't find this kind of food in Los Angles Anymore,As these great establishments can only be found down south. The Mac and cheese and the collard greens were seasoned and cooked to perfection and as my main dish I had some chitlins something you WILL never find in Cali cause everyone is a health nut! \"Thanks Floyds\" for  the reminder of what real soul food is!!"}
{"text":"Excellent southern food in hearty southern portions. Come here if you're hungry! I ordered a dinner combo consisting of one fried chicken thigh and one fried chicken breast, with 2 sides.  The chicken is extra crispy and so deliciously seasoned with very tender juicy meat inside. You know I like it juicy! My sides were the collard greens which is the best I've ever had. The kind here is has a sweet tone to it, instead of the pickled kind found most everywhere else. My other side was broccoli cheese rice which was really good. There's a complimentary piece of cornbread that comes with it too which was buttery and moist and didn't crumble like a lot I've had before from other places. Will return again soon, I wish I knew this place was here years ago because they'd probably know me by name already!"}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetable plate with greens, mac n cheese, yams and pinto beans. The greens were good, mac n cheese and pintos were okay, the yams were stringy and under cooked. After a 25 minute wait in line, I expected better. The food here is not as good as it was in the pass. Don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Yes God! I'm about to be in a serious food coma. For the croaker and shrimp plate with greens and rice and gravy. Absolutely amazing. Best fish I've had in a long time (outside my mamas). Greens were seasoned perfectly and the gravy on the rice was bomb.com!"}
{"text":"Good \"home cooking\", or \"soul food\".   Beef ribs very tasty.  The kind you eat with your hands and then clean up.  Also had pinto beans and Mac n cheese.  Both very good."}
{"text":"Good food good service ... Can't ask for much more.... The mac & cheese could be better but the chicken was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Went here after a customer raved about how good the fried chicken was, so that's what I got. It was GOOD, some of the best I have had in Charlotte(better then the Coop).  Mac and cheese was great also and blacked eyed peas was so so.   I have been raving about this place to others, cant wait to make my way back up there and try it again."}
{"text":"Wow horrible service! Charged me for food they didn't have and when I  asked for my momey back they kept the tip.  Here's a tip smule say hello to your customers and don't charge them for food you don't have. Chicken Box is friendly and nice."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting. Lady serving food behind counter was rude. Place is NOT clean. Air vents on the ceiling hasn't been cleaned in months. I had 2 breast meal...told the lady behind counter 2 breast meal and get served a breast and a wing...said something to her and she just looked at me. Turned around grabbed a piece of breast, slammed it on my plate took the wing off and said \"here\". Breast was dried up, looked like it had been sitting for awhile. When I asked for fresh breast lady said \"they all look like that\" so I said ...ok. Went to the drink station and never at a restaurant had I seen so much \"crap\" and trash laying everywhere I was going to drink lemonade and had to fill my cup twice. BOTH times something black came out of the urn. So I decided to drink water, however they don't offer water, unless you buy a bottle.  I took pics and will post."}
{"text":"First time going most likely won't be back. Restaurant was very dirty smelled like a bathroom, and the mediocre food just doesn't over look that. The beef ribs were good but the greens, \"canned\" yams,\"old\"   fried chicken and \"dry\" Mac and cheese was edible but not return worthy. On top of that the servers aren't pleasant at all."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated, underwhelmed. Service was terrible rude, rude rude. If they don't already know you they won't treat you well.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I love me some soul food! It is this chicas ultimate go to for my southetn fried chicken baked macaroni and cherse green beans with ham and potatoes, fried wings and cornbread. It is um um good. I work close by so i always beat lunch rush. Prices are fare for the food."}
{"text":"I've only been to the original once when I lived in Charlotte.  I was visiting for the game this weekend.  This one isn't as good as I remember the original to be.  But the workers need a lesson in professionalism.  Just all out ratchet!  So as I'm walking in, one of the workers, she looked Latino, was trying to enter in a door that I assume isn't working.  One of the ladies from behind the counter yells to her, \"you gotta go through the other one.\"  Then she says, \"with her dumb self.\"  No laugh no nothing.  There were like six or seven others in the restaurant besides me.  I was like wow calling your coworker dumb all out loud in other customers.  When the worker comes in, she speaks to them, but the others look at her like whatever and don't even speak back.  If y'all don't want the girl working there, just let her go instead of treating her like a pariah.  So to the rude thing taking my order.  If you don't wanna work there, just don't.  Really.  I'm black, but why do black folks always have attitude when serving customers in their establishment?  I promise you if it weren't for wanting some soul food because the ones in the DMV aren't all that, I would have happily canceled the order then and there and walked out.  Just nasty!  Now that I'm back in MD and eating the food, it really isn't all that good.  The collards taste like they're out of the can, the BBQ ribs were okay, and the Mac and cheese is just okay.  I really wanted to calm my Charlotte soul food craving this wknd, but this didn't do it.  I initially asked for pigs feet, but the rude thing said no pigs feet.  The peach cobbler is $3.50 for a cup.  Really lol.  I'll be back to Charlotte, but I most likely won't be going back to Floyd's.  Get rid of the ratchet and rude attitudinal employees!"}
{"text":"I have always fooled myself in thinking this place would become good and each time I am played for a fool. They slap everything together and my fish was soggy from my rice and gravy. And the fish smelled and looked nasty. I will never order from here again. EVER!!! I rather drive to Captain Steves or Chicken Box"}
{"text":"Best soul food in all of Charlotte! Do yourself a favor and try the Mac and cheese, no one else compares to theirs!The sweet tea's always on point! can't forget the cornbread!! Cake like texture, melts in your mouth. You can go in with no soul and come out with it! I highly recommend! Mr.Floyd is such a personable person too!"}
{"text":"Solid choice for Soul Food in the Queen City.  However- be prepared for mediocre to subpar service, usual confusion, and an overall poor experience."}
{"text":"Looking for something to eat after visiting UPS in this area, we settled on Floyd's.  I had heard of the restaurant but had never visited and was unaware of its location.  After all, American soul food is a good bet to fill an empty stomach.  The restaurant was clean (an employee began to clean up more as I waited).  There was a steady flow of customers as well.  I settled on baked white meat chicken, a couple wing dinners, and a kids' shrimp dinner.  I was immediately informed they were out of shrimp.  Then, after about a 15 minute wait, I was informed they were out of the baked white meat chicken.  Since they were out of my other staple, shrimp, I had to settle for chicken wings as well.  30 minutes later, the food was ready and I was on my way.  The chicken wings were small but tasty.  I also had cabbage (2/5), greens (4/5), sweet potatoes (5/5).  Although I am partial to sweet potatoes, they were indeed scrumptious.  The meal is served with two sides and a slice of cornbread (daughter LOVED it).  Overall, the food was good although service was slow (to cook the chicken).  I think I would have been out in 15-20 minutes if the order taker didn't forget they were out of baked white meat chicken."}
{"text":"I visited Floyd's for the first time on 06/03/2018. I ordered beef tips and rice, macaroni, and collard greens with a side of peach cobbler. The food was ok but from the word on the street. I expected greatness how people were hyping up Floyd's as being the must eat place of Charlotte.  My issue was with my beef tips being over salted. I don't have hypertension but after eating at Floyd's; I am pretty sure I increased my chances of getting high blood pressure by 50%. However, the customer service experience was good for the restaurant being so busy on this particular Sunday."}
{"text":"Why did I come here on a Sunday and also soul food and vegan are opposites in the spectrum? Took them at least 45 min total to place and pick up my order. I ordered the French fries, fried squash(egg in batter???), and \"pork-free\" cabbage. Everything was good until I took a closer look at the cabbage and notice some type of meat floating at the bottom of my tray.  Next time if the wife chooses to go here for dinner, I'll have to pass."}
