{"text":"Great food, service and prices.  Because of its location in Heritage Park, I never would have thought to try this place except for its inclusion in YYC Burger Week. I'm glad I made the trip because we've been back a number of times since then.  The BLT salad and kale salad are always really good."}
{"text":"After receiving a gift certificate to Selkirk Grille, I delayed using it as I wrongly assumed I couldn't eat here due to being a vegan and all the menu items I saw contain meat. After about six months of holding onto said gift certificate I decided to give them a call and found they were more than happy to accommodate me and my vegan needs! I called and spoke to a friendly lady in the morning and made a reservation for later that evening as she informed me that the chef would prepare a special meal just for me! Not knowing what that would be, I didn't have high hopes when I arrived, but the waitress was warm and friendly as she told me the Chef had so much fun, spending all day planning my vegan meal just for me! I felt so special!   First was a lovely crisp salad with walnuts and tomatoes... But the main course, oh my, it was one of the delicious things I have ever had in my life! The chef prepared a risotto, which was cooked to perfection, with green beans and asparagus mixed in. It was creamy and the rice was firm. On top of the risotto were two of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, curried potato and lentil patties. Soft yet firm, lightly curried and just stunning, like soft pillows of heaven! Also on my plate were maple glazed carrots, which the waitress informed me are grown on site hydroponically, they were a wonderful accompaniment to the dish.   I am giving this restaurant a 5 star review. Having learned that their chef spent all day coming up with a special dish just for me was just the most lovely thing, to be accommodated so easily and with such warm friendliness! I will be coming back to Selkirk Grille in the future and would recommend them to anyone with a special diet, as I know now they will go above and beyond to ensure you have the most pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Selkirk Grille several times now and have enjoyed it each visit.  The food has always been wonderful and I love the atmosphere.  For the summer there is a lovely, sunny patio and as it's away from any roads you don't get the noise or exhaust fumes.  In the winter there is the skating rink just out the door.  The service has been hit and miss as they have been short staffed on a couple of occasions but the staff has always been friendly and accommodating.  I'd come back anytime."}
{"text":"Undiscovered jewel of Calgary! Who knew there was such a fabulous restaurant tucked away in Heritage Park? We went for the \"Sunday Dinner\" (lovely salad, prime rib with yorkshire pudding, fruit crumble dessert) -- wonderful in its simplicity; brilliant in its understatedness. The place is warm and inviting, the wait staff are relaxed and welcoming, and I look forward to their patio opening up."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here for the first time, I had heard good things from the other people I was dining with (who had all been there before). We'd had some difficulty getting our reservations altered to fit one more person in so we were surprised when it was more than half empty on mother's day.   The food was really so-so (no vegetarian main course on the menu), the waiter wasn't very sensitive to medical issues one of our party has (she was using a tablet device for communication as she had no voice), and when the asked-for cup of chamomile tea turned out to be mostly peppermint we shouldn't have been surprised given that it was pretty characteristic of the attention to detail overall.  It wasn't horrible food, but it wasn't really what I was expecting given past experiences and the price.   The best part of the meal was after the bill was paid, the waiter brought a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries. Took most of the sour taste out of our mouths. Most."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is lovely, and has a nice layout. We came here in October for my birthday lunch. Service started out being efficient. We were seated, the hostess took our coats, and the waitress came by to fill our waters. We brought our own wine, and she promptly opened it for us. My mom doesn't drink red wine, so she asked for a glass of champagne. We ended up waiting almost 15 minutes for one glass of champagne, which was a bit annoying for my mom. I would understand if they were super busy or had tons of drinks to make, but we were one of 4 tables in the restaurant. I'm a server, so I can sympathize with these things. But, if I see you texting behind the bar while someone is waiting for a drink, I will not be impressed. When she finally returned, we ordered our food. Food came out pretty quickly, which was good. I had the chicken sandwich, and it was delicious. The avocado yogurt sauce was great, and the fries were well cooked and seasoned also. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food, so that was redeeming. After doing a quality check, we never saw our waitress again. The manager had to come by and clear our plates, and bring our bill. When I told them it was my birthday, they said \"Oh, that's nice.\" At my work, when it is someone's birthday, we bring them a complimentary dessert. I've also been to several places that bring out ice cream or something sweet to nosh on. Would it have really put them out to bring me something? I'm not asking for a 3 tiered cake or anything, just a little bit of ice cream maybe. Seemed a bit strange to me. Also, when we left, I waited and waited at the hostess stand for someone to retrieve my coat. Finally, I just opened the closet and grabbed my coat. I found it extremely careless to leave people's coats unattended like that. Overall, the service was really subpar. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the food really was great."}
{"text":"Was here this past Friday. My wife and I were greeted at the front by two hostesses. The server we had, was very friendly and efficient. I wish I remembered her name, that way I could've mentioned her as part of my review. Our drink orders were taking right away then a few minutes after our drinks arrived we ordered our appetizer. We decided to share the crab and shrimp cakes. They come out presented on one of those white rectangular serving dishes with three crab cakes. They were smaller then I've had in other restaurants but tasty nonetheless. I ordered the rib eye steak (medium rare) It was accompanied by two pieces of asparagus three baby carrots, and a wedge of a potato casserole looking thingy (sorry don't know the technical term). The vegetables were well cooked, and the steak was done nicely. I would say though there was a little more fatty pieces that I desire. (BUT STILL GOOD). My wife had the halibut, and the one thing she said, was that a was a little dry. Again it was also still good).I will be back, but next time I'll order something different. Also I would like to try the outdoor patio on a nice summer evening. This past Friday was a little cooler and windy. I also think the patio was closed."}
{"text":"What a treat! Hard to find a restaurant that has it all! Great customer service , fabulous atmosphere, and great food! Well, we did! We decided to go early, 4 o'clock, after reserving, the restaurant called to see if we were ok with a lunch menu, which is more limited in choices. We were all fine with that. We were greeted by Rudy, who looked after us all for the rest of our meal. He was such a pleasure, and was very knowledgable about the menu items. The charcuterie tray was all local meats, cheeses and pates', the burger outstanding, and the wings certainly was a generous helping and very tasty. Since we had a very pregnant relative with us, Rudy made us both virgin drinks. What I also appreciated, was the fact we could hear each other when we were conversing, and didn't have to yell to be heard. Some of the new restaurants are just too loud! What a pleasure! We will definitely be back for supper some time. Check out tues dinner and a movie, it looks like it would be great! Thanks again Rudy! We want you next time too! Did not know this place was even here two days ago!"}
{"text":"I recently went here with my co~workers for our night staff Christmas dinner.  We had a reservation for 5:30, but in usual fashion my co~workers all rolled in over an hour or  so later.  The staff was very patient with us.  They were extremely friendly(one even got hugs from us when we left) and attentive.  We didn't have to ask for anything... they were at our table frequently keeping drinks topped up and food fresh.    The food was good!    We split several appetizers between a bunch of us.  I tried the duck poutine, the butternut squash risotto and the crispy squid.  It was all so good!  I don't like seafood and refuse to try calamari, but I gave the squid a try and it was really good!  I loved the tomato eggplant dipping sauce that came with it.  I ordered the stuffed chicken breast and veggies.  It was very tasty!  For dessert I went with the peppermint mocha cheesecake and it was ever so heavenly!    They closed the kitchen at 9pm.. or so they told us that's when it closes when we asked, but let us sit there, drink and chat until after 11 pm.  They weren't really busy with it being a cold Tuesday evening.  They had one large party and another group our size there.  We stayed as long as the large party stayed.  The staff never asked us to leave although I am sure they wanted to close and go home, but we saw no sign of that.    It's a nice place decor wise.  Nothing super fancy, but nice.  We took a bunch of pictures that the staff helped out with too.  This was our second work function there and I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"It was hot day with humidity in Calgary. We were visiting the Heritage Park. After we saw Gasoline lane( old car museum), walked a little bit. The park looked huge, we walked back, stopped here. It was cool and dark inside. The host lady gave us a table between entrance door and the patio door. I asked her a booth near.  We wanted to sit down and relax. That's it. We just had a huge Korean lunch in Calgary! It was happy hour time. I had local IPA which was excellent. Away from our group, having beer with veges was a very great idea. Actually we wanted tea in a tea house, but it was full."}
{"text":"Excellent service, wonderful lamb burger (but i wimped and switched to cheddar cheese, passing on the blue), really good smoked bison poutine!"}
{"text":"My Wife & I received a gift card for the Selkirk Grille. Both of us being Vegans, I called ahead to see if the kitchen would be able to accommodate us. It can be tricky trying to find a restaurant that will cook Vegan if it isn't the typical menu fare - my fears were quickly put to rest. The lady I spoke to confirmed that we'd have no problem - the Chef would prepare Vegan dishes, and we'd be good to go. We made reservations & showed up later that evening.  We wondered if we'd have to tell our waitress the Vegan request again, but we had no reason to! She was fully prepared, and advised us that all was specially prepared, and described the upcoming meal to us. She was kind, respectful, and really added to the experience. The food was absolutely amazing, the manager even came over to see how we were liking it - our waitress also let us know that the Chef had been specially preparing a perfect Vegan meal for us all day - what a treat! To know that we were made a special dish where so much thought had been put into it, as opposed to just giving us some side dishes that happened to be Vegan, was just incredible. On top of the excellent staff & amazing chef, the atmosphere and ambiance of the place was just what you'd expect from a restaurant located at Heritage Park - it was classic, and classy. The music playing fit the old-time feel & theme of the Grille - it was perfect. For these reasons, I can't give the Selkirk Grille anything less than 5 stars. Compliments to the Management, the staff, and the Chef!!"}
{"text":"We went here for Valentine's Day. It's at Heritage Park. The atmosphere is nice and romantic. They had added some special touches for the occasion. Really made it stand out. The servers were polite and nice but a little slow.  For the day they had a tasting menu. The food was good, but nothing overly exciting. There were some courses that I didn't finish because they weren't balanced right or something.  You could definitely tell they were trying to make everything on the plate work together but in a few of the courses it just fell short. That being said the courses that worked were good but not knock your socks off. Nothing that would have me planning my next night out there.   They did cap off the night with a rose for all the ladies.  Overall, it's a nice restaurant but I wouldn't be going out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Finally a decent restaurant along the bike path of the Glenmore reservoir that doesn't require an admission ticket. I was very happy when the Sellkirk grill was developed. However upon several visitations over several years I have become disappointed in this restaurant. The menu reads much better than the food that is served. I find it slightly pretentious overpriced and under delivered. Great focus on local cuisine but the quality and the price does not match the restaurants with which it would compete. I would rather see an increase in quality than a decrease in price."}
{"text":"Charming patio and restaurant located just outside of the entrance to Heritage Park. Went for Sunday Brunch with friends with young children. The menu lacked a little for the young ones but the server was helpful and accommodating.  Afterwards we checked out the museum - all around good dining experience."}
{"text":"Went here for a Christmas-y type dinner with my fiance.   We made reservations but apparantly they didn't have it in their computer system.  Thankfully they weren't too busy and we were seated right away, accompanied by many apologies.  We got a small table for two in a quiet corner right at the front of the restaurant.  Our server was down to earth and spunky, and although she forgot things her personality more than made up for the few mistakes.  Dinner was delicious, I had the prime rib and it was cooked perfectly.  The vegetables were seasoned well.     After dinner I ordered tea, but they unfortunately didn't have any- which I found to be quite odd.  So we skipped the post dinner drink and headed home.  Overall it was a good dining experience, and the food was homey and well done."}
