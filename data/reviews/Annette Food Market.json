{"text":"Enjoyed the food overall, but the pizza was the star.  In my opinion, among the best authentic Neapolitan pizza in Toronto.  

Someone commented below that it was poorly executed and soggy at the bottom.  True authentic Neapolitan pizza is supposed to have a soft, soggy middle.  This pizza was executed to perfection!  The way to eat this with your hands is cut a slice, fold it at the crust, tuck in the soft center back toward the pizza/crust and eat!

Now if someone enjoys their pizza with a crisp bottom throughout, that is perfectly fine(me included), its just not Neapolitan style in that case."}
{"text":"Sorry in advance for this long post! When I made a reservation for my husband's birthday dinner at The Annette Food Market I asked if we could have 16 people in their private room in the back (Harvest Room) and they wrote me an email saying '16 we can squeeze'. Which was not an issue for us. When we got to the restaurant our server was busy (I understand that) but treated us like we were in his way.  When I counted the seats there were only 14 so I told him our reso was for 16 and he said something along the lines of nope can't do that. 14 max. So I told him that there's nothing I can do now because all 16 of us are at the restaurant and he was so irritated and kept saying 14 is the Max. So at this point all our friends feel the tension and I pull out the email that I got from the restaurant saying they can take 16 people. Then he leaves without saying anything and comes back with 2 more chairs and says it's going to be uncomfortable.  So I said 'that's ok.' And he says 'maybe for you guys but I'm the one who has to serve you guys in this small space'. And leaves again. We contemplated leaving because he created such a nasty atmosphere.  However, we were all there already and didn't know of a place that could take 16 people at last minute notice.

It's unfortunate because we live down the street but there are also a whole bunch of great restaurants in the Junction with good customer service which is very important to me."}
{"text":"I had so wanted to LOVE this place...but sadly, I think it deserves its mixed-reviews status. 
We live in the neighbourhood, and so we were really excited to see a tapas bar within walking distance (and stumbling back home distance!)--and we were hoping that being away from the Queen/King/downtown vibe would equal friendly, down-to-earth, and flexible service. Sadly not the case, but at least the food was good, although worth a pretty penny. 
The short of it: our experience was that the serving staff are not into customer service. Our dishes were all prepared excellently--my one suggestion would be to invest in better quality muscles--the sauce was exquisite (i mean, how do you go wrong in a butter/bacon sauce), but the quality of the muscles weren't very good.
The good food but the poor service seems typical from the reviews here and others i've spoken with.
The long of it: 
My husband and I arrived around 9ish and as there were a few tables available, we requested the server if we could have the table furthest from the door (it was a cold evening). Her response was no, as the tables are too heavy to be moved (the table i was pointing at had been pushed to another table to seat the previous group of 4). I stared at her incredulously as it was obvious it had been pushed together to make that table of 4. Ok fine, whatever. 
Next, we're debating our wine order (we were gonna order a bottle), and requested if we could have a small sample of the two wines we were deliberating before ordering a bottle. Before I could even say, we'd be happy to pay extra for the sample, her response was that they don't do samples and proceeded to explain the difference in the 2 wines. I expect the most prissiest of restaurants to not sample their wines, but given that each of the ones we were contemplating are served by the glass, this was really off-putting. Finally, when we did order our wine (a chianti), it was chilled far too cold. Realizing I would get no where fast with our server, I tried requesting a different server if we could place our bottle closer to their fire oven so that it could warm up a bit, and his response was Chianti's are meant to be chilled (true) and that it was in the perfectly right temp in their wine fridge. He did put the table's tea light beside the bottle though and said the bottle should warm up by the time we're ready for our next glass--was not the case. 
Food was really tasty: we ordered the melted cheese pot (yummmm---melted cheese), the muscles (poor quality muscles but were floating in a lick-the-bottom-of-the pot-good bacon/butter sauce), the wild boar ragu (mediocre), the rapini (delicious), the pork shoulder (likely the BEST item we ordered--GET IT!), and the short-rib (really good too). 
Would we return--probably not. I'm not going to pay these prices to get such poor service in the JUNCTION!"}
{"text":"Had their vday prix fixe menu and the selection was not the greatest and the food was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic, we shared 4 starters and 4 \"mains\" for 4 people - probably slightly more food than we needed - but I would be hard pressed to order less - it was all so tasty.
Fear not if you are seated at the high table next to the pizza oven - it is very comfortable even on a summer night."}
{"text":"Yum. Drinks, food, atmosphere, location- loved it!
Definitely coming back.
PS Beef carpaccio was amazing! Next time I will order 2 to start, for myself, not to share:)"}
{"text":"Simple and delicious.  One of my favourite places in the Junction.  Everything we ate was incredible and the staff super courteous and helpful.  I would say our dinner was a little pricey, but totally worth it.  I would do it again and again and again....I'm still drooling thinking about the chocolate raspberry square that I got at the end.  Good enough to drag your ass to the West end."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Very down to earth staff, knowledgeable and friendly. Pizza is my new fave in the city! The risotto balls are unbelievable, funghi pizza is my fave but it's all excellent! Love that it's tucked away on Annette street. Wine a tad bit expensive fir the glass. Don't recommend for groups as it's super small. I'll definitely be back again...."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Friday night, was getting busy around 6 but didn't have to wait long for a table. Atmosphere was good, and staff answered our questions about the menu and recommended some drinks.

Pizza was one of the best I've had - fresh toppings and a perfectly cooked, chewy crust. Porcini mushroom ravioli with pear and butter was also delicious and cooked al dente. The rabbit ragu stood out for us - great depth of flavour and surprisingly filling for the size. The dishes are tapas style so it was good to order a few to share.

Drinks were also good - wine choice paired well with the food and the basil raspberry cocktail was especially refreshing and strong. For dessert, order the raspberry chocolate bar - you'll be glad you did!

The only negative is that the space is insanely small, and a line was forming not too long after we arrived. They only take reservations for groups of 8 or more, where there is a private space in the back.

Excellent food, drinks, and atmosphere with friendly service means we will definitely return - I'm still dreaming of their pizza :) Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"We loved it here.
They don't take reservations, so we went on a weds night and were seated immediately. 
We got the sausage pizza, mushroom ravioli and pan sauteed chicken. It was delicious!
The cocktails (I had a blueberry mint) was wonderful too!
The only thing we were not super keen on was the ceaser salad to start was full romaine hearts but otherwise we really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Most wonderful ambience. scrumptious and intriguing dishes. I loved staring into the wood burning pizza oven!
Congrats, Max !"}
{"text":"Excellent food, weak service at best. Throughout our entire visit the server made it clear that she was thoroughly annoyed. We will likely be returning to Hole In the Wall for our meals out."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best, if not the best restaurant in the Junction. The food is outstanding and the menu changes seasonally -as do the cocktails-  so there's always something new to try. The staff are friendly, and can offer plenty of insight into the food and winelist.

It's a cozy, family friendly atmosphere and every seat had a view of the kitchen and the centrepiece wood-fired oven."}
{"text":"Very good Neopolitain pizza. The price was pretty good as well and they have a good selection of beer."}
{"text":"A sublime food experience. Everything item was beyond what I could have hoped for. When do you ever say that the cauliflower was amazing? Best eggplant parm I've ever had. The service was exemplary."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night for drinks and appetizers/dessert. Loved it! Small space, beautiful inside, friendly staff, fantastic food and wine/cocktails. Recommended! One of the best spots in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to in Toronto from far. We were a group of 6 and everyone loved it. I strongly recommand the porcini ravioli and the octopus carpaccio. The wine list is excellent (great Spanish wine). Service was outstanding. A real gem in the Junction."}
{"text":"We went to the Annette Food market last night for dinner.  It was our second time there - our first time was actually quite lovely.  Last night was ok, but could have been better. However, we won't be returning, because of the reasons set out below.

The pros:

The pizza was delicious.
The glass of wine I had was also great.
The appetizers were tasty
Overall, the food was good.

The Cons:

We were seated at a table in the back of the restaurant, where there really shouldn't be a table.  I was stuck looking at the kitchen all night.  Nothing else to look at.  For me, the ambiance was lacking.

The charcuterie board was a bit lean for the price. 

The biggest sticking issue for us last night was that we were not allowed to taste the wine (which was already open and available by the glass) before buying a bottle  It's the restaurant's policy.  According to our server, this policy allows the restaurant to \"use the full bottle of wine\" and \"keep their price points down\".  Subsequently, we didn't buy the bottle. We spent about $25 on booze last night - a single glass of wine (overpriced at $17) and a beer.  Had we been able to taste the wine, we would have spent $65 on the bottle, and probably another $30 on cocktails.  $25 spent vs. $95 potential (or more).  

Because we love to have a nice bottle of wine with dinner, and because this policy does not ensure that we will actually enjoy the bottle we are buying, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love these local-neighbourhood joints; if I lived in this area, I can me coming here often.

We were here for a birthday party, so we got the private room at the back. Note, it was a very hot day, and that room had only one A/C that clearly wasn't enough to cool the whole room. As I don't mind being hot, it was okay for me, but I guess as the days get cooler, this shouldn't be a problem.

Main room, space is very tight. This is the kind of place that tables are very close together. I think there is a corner bar space that is quite romantic. 

I love how wine choices are written on the board. When in the private room, just go out to see what wine/bottle you want to drink and someone will take the order and bring it.

The food is Italian inspired - we had the pizza which is yummy, but I still like my Neapolitan-style. Lots of plates for sharing and good for groups.

Don't know if I would necessarily be back (only because I don't live in this area). Not sure if this place takes reservation, but if so, please do. This place gets very busy."}
{"text":"This is Nice neighbourhood spot. We really wanted to love it and had hoped that we had found our new go to restaurant. The ambiance is cool. Food was ok, a bit salty. I would give it another try in the future since it is so close to home."}
{"text":"Annette Food Market was alright, but I won't be coming back.  The food is good, but the experience had some disappointments.  A shame because we had been looking to come here for a long time, and read & heard good things.

The one thing I noticed, as a person that enjoys beverages: there were NO domestic/local beer taps or wines! Maybe it's just me, but most neighbourhood restaurants have something, but this place seemed like it was anti-Canadian with their listings.  Personally, I prefer to try new local beverages, and prefer establishments with a locavore mentality (sad, I was expecting more out of \"Annette Food Market\").

The service was... I'd say less friendly than I'm used to for a neighbourhood joint.  Yes, they did the job, but it's less enjoyable when a server is bitter because another staffer was late.

I came with my wife on a Saturday at 5:30pm for dinner, thinking that they didn't take reservations.  Turns out, they recently started accepting reservations.  The place was half full, and they gave us a table by the window; we wanted a better table, but it was reserved.  During our meal, they rejected seating several other walk-ins, despite the half-empty restaurant.  The party for that reserved table arrived at 7pm.  In my opinion, the response should have been, \"ok, it's 5:30 now, that table's booked for 7pm.  If you can be done by then, it's yours.\"  Instead we had the cold window table.  In that time, they could have, and should have seated us in the better table, and another party.  Getting rejected out of a half empty restaurant leaves sour tastes in peoples' mouths.

In \"my\" way:
1. We get seated at a better table. (win)
2. Another party gets seated. (win)
3. The restaurant makes more $. (win)
4. Other customers get rejected out of a full, rather than empty restaurant.  (as expected, no loss)

Instead, they lost on 4 points of common sense as my way would have still allowed the party with the reservation to have their table on time."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place b/c of the good reviews. Food was average, small portions, high prices. $80 for 2 ppl, that was salad main entree and a drink each. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Go to Italy in YYZ.  Carpaccio, pizza, wine, cocktails are in an intimate neighbourhood area.  Definite go."}
{"text":"Nice neighbourhood place and overall a great spot.  However, for a small restaurant there are too many rules - no sitting at your 4 top if all guests are not present, no food orders from the bar while waiting for the others to arrive.  Bartender could do better, make eye contact and acknowledge waiting guests."}
{"text":"Great place. If I would recommend one thing...get rid of 100$ fine for cancelling the reservations. Once we showed up and they didn't have our reservation noted down. Had to wait an hour to be seated. They never paid us 100$. It doesn't seem fair practice and leaves a bad taste about the organizational culture."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, drool-worthy food and friendly staff. This place would have received five stars if I didn't constantly get elbowed in the back by the same waiter while sitting with my friends at the bar. 

He was apologetic, but it happened too many times (by only that one staff member) that it made my night a little less fun. So if you go, wait for a table. 

The food is what made my review a four-star! Pizza was cooked perfectly, the arancini had the perfect burst of cheese in them and the beet salad was devine. But if you go here, make sure you have the ravioli! There just are no words!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night after a nice afternoon walking in High Park which is nearby. The restaurant opens at 5 and we booked for 5pm the day before. It did require credit card info and we were told there's only 1.5 hour seating for 5pm reservation. Which is fine for us, it just sounded a bit short. 

The restaurant was quite empty at 5pm but quickly became busy by 6 when we finished the meal. We ordered three dishes - a eggplant parmesan, a short ribs, and a octopus carpaccio. I really liked their presentation, simple and beautiful. Flavour wise, I really liked the eggplant Parmesan, and the other two are pretty good too. 

Four stars because of two things - 1) the short ribs dish seems a bit too simple - no side dishes, no mash potato, no veggies - literally just two short ribs. 2) the octopus carpaccio is incredibly small portioned. It is a full plate, but given how thin a piece of carpaccio is, you probably are really getting just two inch of the tentacle. On the menu, you typically see smallest/lightest dish at the top in each section, and the heaviest dish at the bottom. Short ribs are the last one in Meat & Cheese, and Octopus is the last in Fish & Seafood, i.e. also the most expensive one in that section, but the portion we were getting is a bit small for what we paid."}
{"text":"The drinks are phenomenal and so is the food at a fair price point. What a gem. If there was one problem with this place it is that it's too small, when you're doing this much right, you'll need a bigger space to keep up with demand"}
{"text":"Dropped in for the first time a couple of weeks ago, not really sure what to expect. My wife and I were really impressed. We had the octopus, pork shoulder, ravioli and margarita pizza - everything was delicious. The ravioli was one of the best I've had. Their pizza also rivals some of the city's best Napoletano pizzas - wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Service was friendly, restaurant is cozy but has it's charm. Great wine list, decent beer selection."}
{"text":".@annettefoodmarket This newly opened neighbourhood restaurant is a great addition to the food in this area. It's small, doesn't take reservations. On it's 2nd week of opening, it was packed. Short wait for a table on a Saturday night, but it was getting fuller as we stayed. There's only a handful of tables and two bar tables at the back. The kitchen is in the front beside the bar. Heavy duty fans take away any sort of smell of food. 

There is a private dining room at the back, and some back kitchen where certain dishes are prepped. I saw servers running back and forth from there, between the private dining area. 

The menu is Italian, I thought it would be small tapas plates only, but actually food was well priced and with good portions that between two people you could have 3-4 dishes. 

The PIZZA was tasty, but it was soggy on the bottom. The dough tasted more like a pita than pizza dough, which was good different, but since it was soggy, cutting it was really tough, and hard to eat gracefully. 

The PORCINI MUSHROOM RAVIOLI was really good. The pasta was stuffed with yummy mushroom, and the sauce really flavourful. Addition of pear really made the dish. 

The BONE MARROW ($9) was a large portion which I liked. They mixed some sweet raisins into it and served with some homemade melba like toast. Personally I like my bone morrow simply with some sea salt. Addition of the sweetness, doesn't let me taste it properly. 

We skipped dessert. For drinks beer was around $8-9, and some non-alcoholic mocktails were available if you ask. The Hibiscus Lemonade was tasty."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had my 15th birthday party there and the staff was incredible. The food was also excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant ."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and pasta for those who love authentic italian. Food is ALWAYS consistent and the staff is an absolute pleasure! Always treated like family whenever I go in. Cannot give a higher recommendation for this restaurant. If you're a foodie and in the Junction, this restaurant should be first on your list."}
{"text":"We have some exceptional restaurants in the Junction, but this meal and our drinks were decidedly memorable. With no reservations, and a full house, we waited a few minutes and took a seat at the bar.  We started the night off with two of their cocktails: the unique Elixir D'Amore and a Barrel-Aged Negroni - the first was unique and the second was oh-so-good.  Our shared plates included the Winter Caprese (with burrata in place of mozzarella and out-of-this-world cherry tomatoes on the vine and a fine parmesan crisp), the Brussels Sprouts (paired with pancetta bits, how can you go wrong?), the Butternut Squash Agnolotti (to die for), the delicate and bright Beef Carpaccio and the Mussels (with an out-of-this-world Pernod and smoked cedar sauce).  The staff's suggestion for a red wine pairing, the hard-to-find Murphy Goode 2013 Cab Sauve hit the right note.  Needless to say, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Baked cheese pot was to die for. Short rib was excellent too. Their house special gnocchi that day was incredible as well. The beer delirium tremors was good. Bread pudding dessert was not good, get the chocolate pudding. Two people, 9 orders, 4 glasses of beer and 2 desserts = $160 before tip! Was worth every penny. Romantic atmosphere but at the same time we saw families and kids and girls night out parties. Enjoy"}
{"text":"We had a great server, knows her stuff about each item on the menu. I wouldnt reccommend bringing a date here on a saturday night as we went during 9pm and it was busy with group parties and bar goers (the space and table size is limited). Its a tapas style venue, where each plate can be priced around 8.00 to 16.00. The carbonara noodles were half cooked. The pork shoulder is very tender. But the baked cheese dish is to die for. 
Overall decent experience, but for a pretty penny."}
{"text":"Love the cosy atmosphere here. Just rock up and sit at the bar. Danielle, the cocktail exceptionaire makes the experience. :)"}
{"text":"Annette Food Market gets five stars alone for their pizzas (but also for other food items, as well as their extremely privileged selection of wine per the glass). The pizzas are real authentic Neapolitan. The dough they use is properly leavened, and the baking time is below two minutes (actually, I timed it; it's 1.15 minutes) - meaning it's extreme heat for a short period of time. This is where you go if you feel like real (!!) pizza and a proper glass of wine!!"}
{"text":"Ambience: 5/5
Cost: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5

I've been to the coffee place next door and loved their soy latte, that when I read a post about Annette's being open just next door  (same owners), I knew I had to come visit. A friend of mine had moved to the Junction, so coupled with Annette's being in the area gave me a really good excuse to come visit.

I came for a late dinner and I immediately loved the ambience when I stepped foot into the restaurant. it was small but cozy, and the lighting was just perfectly romantic. Candles were lit everywhere and it was a place that I knew I wanted to be in.

For food, my boyfriend and I shared a few dishes: the charcuterie plate, arancini, fish, and the butternut squash ravioli with brown butter and sage (on average, $8-15 per plate). It was kind of late in the night and we didn't want to eat too much so opted to share a few things. 

I really wanted to like the ravioli (it's pretty much the only reason why I really gunned for Annette's), but it didn't exactly live up to what I thought it was going to be. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, I think the taste of the brown butter threw me off a bit and the butternut squash was sweeter than how I've had it before. FYI I believe the menu changes with the freshest produce, so some of the items might not be available anymore.

I hear they're open for brunch now too but haven't had a chance to try. Hopefully soon though!"}
{"text":"The service here is phenomenal. The food is full of flavour. The cocktails are creative and tasty. So happy to have this place in our neighbourhood. I had an amazing birthday dinner here in April and another amazing meal last night. The prices are super affordable too!"}
{"text":"When I looked at the menu online and saw the prices, I thought, \"Oh, these are reasonable prices, perfect.\"  Then we arrive and are told that they recommend 2-3 plates per person...so yay, small plates for the price of big plates.  

The FOOD:  We ordered a nice assortment of items from the menu.  On average, the food was a good effort and has lots of potential, but every dish had some flaw big enough that it really made it frustrating to be paying this much
--Rapini ($7): Decent cook of the rapini, tiny portion.  
--Porchetta Pizza ($15 or $16): The pizza crust was very well-cooked, nice wood-fired crumb.  Sadly the porchetta was completely unsalted...it was the weirdest thing I'd tasted and desperately needed seasoning.
--Potato & 'Nduja Croquettes ($9): Upon us all wondering where the 'nduja was, the bartender helpfully informed us that it was mixed in the dough. Sadly, none could be detected, which was too bad as the dish was bland.  And just 2 croquettes for $9.
--Porcini Mushroom Ravioli ($12):  The filling was lovely, and the classic nutty brown butter/sage sauce was fantastic with all the amazing depths of flavors that can be achieved in such a sauce.  Sadly, the ravioli were undercooked at the edges.
Overall, some good efforts, but big enough flaws to make me really struggle with the pricing.

For DRINKS they have 3 beers on tap including oddly enough Delirium Tremens.  Decent cocktail list, and the bartender knows her stuff.  The barrel-aged negroni my friends ordered was quite nice...the barrel aging really melded the flavors (I believe aperol was used in place of campari).  My drink, the barrel-aged white martini was not such as a hit, as the barrel-aged spirit is overwhelmed by a large dose of maraschino.  Thankfully, the bartender quickly offered to adjust the proportions, but the original ratios are way off.

The VIBE is great.  Cozy space.  Woodburning stove in the corner.  Friendly staff and prompt service.   

No reservations, so be prepared to wait.  

OVERALL, a decent effort, but the at these prices for tapas portions, the quality of the food needs to be way higher!"}
{"text":"A superb dinner!  We loved every dish and the special fish (sea bream) was outstanding. Other highlights were the calamari and the beef ragout. An amazing selection of wines by the glass and friendly, efficient and knowledgeable service. It's first rate in every way"}
{"text":"Many friends had told it was a great place And they didn't lie.   Food was fresh and delicious.  Wine choices were perfect. 
Perfect portion sizes.  
Thanks !  We will be back"}
{"text":"Our first time there last night and we will be back definitely! We had the risotto balls, marghertita pizza, baked cheese, and short ribs. Absolutely delicious! And great atmosphere in the place."}
{"text":"D and I came here with his friends to celebrate a birthday. It is in a quiet area near High Park. Walking into this restaurant, it is a small and intimate setting. They can accommodate one large party of at most 10 people and we were in a private room in the back. The decor of this place is, I would classify as, rustic contemporary. I really like the ambiance of this place. 

The food menu style is in a tapas style. So typically (as the server explained to us) you would order 2-3 items per person and share among the party. Our party decided to order items and share between the couples. So D and I ordered, the Bone Marrow, White Anchovy Pizza, Octopus Carpacio, and the Spare Ribs. I would have to say my favorite was the Octopus Carpacio. The Octopus was thinly sliced dressed with a light arugula salad. The service at this place is really good too. The servers are all friendly and professional. Any questions we had, they were able to provide answers. Too bad they were sold out of the Pork Shoulder. I wanted to try the Pork Shoulder - maybe next time. 

I would say this is definitely a good place to come back to for dinner especially for special occasions."}
{"text":"Looking for a family oriented space with incredible food and service and ambiance?!?  This is it.  
The wood iron oven: pizza of all kinds were spectacular. especially the mushroom
The grilled dishes: octopus, anchovies were delightful 
The fried: risotto balls, cauliflower
The drink menu: cocktails were epic
Pasta: beef ragu

Date night front, family dining in the back."}
{"text":"Loved my first dinner here at Annette's. 

With a very cozy atmosphere and great service the night was an experience to remember.  5 stars for service. 
This place is very small with a party room in the back that can fit 8-10 people quite well. 

The wine selection is great with a fabulous dessert menu to finish the night. 

Had a great tasting menu tonight which included these unique ravioli with it's taste and preparation.  The wood oven pizza is great and so are the other pasta dishes. 

I especially enjoyed the beef short rib which was amazing and tender.  The beef and octopus carpaccio were on of the best I have had all summer. 

There were some items I thought that could have been a bit better. The calamari was not very tasty and the tagliatelle was clumped together. 

The dessert platter we had was 100% all winners. 

I am looking forward brining my friends here. Thanks to my friends at #passthetable who booked this night.

{"text":"TLDR : Good food that you would find downtown but overpriced, especially on the wine list and portions. 

Second time coming here and felt I had to write a review for the first time. The food as always was  good with a couple misses. To start off, you will most likely need to wait 30 min for a table without a reservation. They have a nice little bar you can wait at. However one thing you do notice instantly during your wait is that they do not have A/C in the restaurant. This is clearly a way to save money since I am sure they figure the pizza oven and an A/C unit would work against each other, but that's a sacrifice they should make. It was pretty hot in the restaurant.

Drinks
Cheapest glass of wine is 13 dollars.  Average cocktail is about 14 ( which are very good) so best bang for your buck are the cocktails.The gisele and G&T are both very good. Wine list is only OK, definitely over price for the selection and bottles. 

Food
Brussels sprouts to start - under cooked and drenched in olive oil. Definitely a nice dish but poorly executed this time around.

Ravioli - very good, price wise pretty high - $16 for 6 pieces, could probably only share it with 3 people not even 4.

Ragu - very good, $16, would highly recommend

Gorgonzola pizza - again poorly executed, the bottom was too soggy, probably needed another 30 seconds in the oven or toppings needed to be lighter.

No complaints about the service, small restaurant you will receive as little or as much attention as you require. 

Overall, it is a good neighborhood restaurant that prices itself as a high end Italian restaurant in the likes of Buca, campagnolo, etc. You won't embarrass  yourself with people who know food by going here and for the area it is one of the best."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant. It's cute, cozy and around the corner. Came here with my husband and two friends to celebrate a Birthday.

Food - 4.5 stars
Ambiance - 4 stars
Customer service - 2.5 stars 

The restaurant closed at 10:00 and at 9:45 we were given our bill. 10:15 - we were given our jackets and effectively 'politely' kicked out. Seemed like pretty bad customer service given we had just spent over $200! To add insult to injury there were 3 ladies still at the bar eating and drinking (they may have been owners we weren't sure).

Also - server constantly trying to upsell asking us if we wanted to buy another bottle of wine when all of our glasses were still full.

Despite delicious food (Risotto balls and mushroom pizza were quite tasty) was rather turned off by the rude customer service!  Not sure if we'd come back ..."}
{"text":"Just around the corner from our home, I bike past here daily and finally went in for dinner with the family. Everything from start to finish was fantastic. Delicious tapas style portions and everything was spot on delicious but let's start at the bar. I had one of their cocktails and it was spectacular. Home made cherries that garnish the drink were to die for and the barmaid was awesome. After sitting at the bar we moved to a table and ordered a few options: roasted cauliflower, fried greens, gnocchi, ravioli... Everything was great. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were excited for the opening of AFM over a year ago, as we often frequent the related Good Neighbour coffee shop next door. We've been there for both dinner and brunch. Brunch is served seasonally only during the summer. The chicken and waffles is hands down the best I've had! Perfectly crispy and moist, waffles, perfect, maple. Mmm. Their other brunch choices are also  quite rustic and unique (ie. Farners eggs baked in their pizza oven with chorizo and tomato sauce). Dinner was quite good too - fresh pastas, raviolis and pizzas, as well as killer cocktails. All served up in a cozy ambience. Even though it's a neighbourhood restaurant, it's got a perfect balance of comfort and trendy. Would love to be back to gather a larger group to sit st their harvest table in the back room (8-14 people). This can be reserved on their website. They don't take reservations (except for Weds) which can be a bit inconvenient when trying to plan dinner."}
{"text":"went here for the first time and liked the overall meal.  I was not blown away but they had some really tasty dishes- like the Beef Ragu, cauliflower.  had two pizzas - the tomato and basil and the spicy pizza.  the first was excellent with great tomato sauce and the second was also very good but was a little too oily.  We also had the Beet salad which the waiter recommended but were not that impressed with it.  was a little too sweet.  

Wine list was not that great.  really only a selection of Italian and French and nothing else. was also very pricy as most glasses were $17 or more for maybe a 5oz glass.  

wait staff was OK, not overly friendly but adequate.    

Overall, I did enjoy myself and think this is a good addition to the hood. 

I'd have given it 4 stars if it were not for the expensive wine by the glass."}
{"text":"Went to Annette Food Market this evening with my husband.  We had: beets with burrata and chestnut puree, rapini with garlic and shallots, bone marrow, risotto balls (arancini), short ribs and pasta with boar ragu.  

Are you thinking that this is a lot to eat for two people?  It is.  Way too much.  We asked the server what the deal was with the menu and told him that we were thinking of getting 4 dishes.  He said that this may not be enough.  His explanation was confusing. He told us to think of the menu like we were shopping at the supermarket.  He said that the short rib was just a single rib.  Confusing. 

The beets with burrata - this dish was fine. Cubed beets, half a ball of burrata.  Nothing was added by the chestnut puree.  It was a sweet preserved favour and an odd contrast to the fresh light flavours in the rest of the dish, but innocuous.  

Rapini with garlic and shallots - this dish was lovely.  Just as described.  Sauteed rapini with garlic, shallots and sundried tomatoes with a healthy sprinkling of salty parmesan or grand padano.  Just lovely. 

The bone marrow - this dish turned me right off.  I am not a bone marrow aficionado but I believe that in the past I have enjoyed it roasted with butter and that's all.  This dish was like the marrow had been removed, mixed with other things and then returned to the bone.  It was greasy and cloying. 

Risotto balls - delicious and crisp on the outside. filled with creamy risotto and melted cheese, topped with salty tomato and parmesan, sitting atop a little bed of arugula. Heavenly.

Short ribs - just order the short ribs.  You need nothing else in your life right now.  Served in a little cast iron skillet we got three English cut beef short ribs (odd given that the server said it would be one). Meaty, tender, delicious and really done perfectly.  Sitting in a perfect amount of gravy.  These were just wonderful.  

Pasta with boar ragu - it may have been that I was too full when this arrived to appreciate it, but I thought it was bland. It needed more salt and more sweet and more .... just more.  It was dull. 

A word about the wine list: This restaurant has an extensive wine list. Red, white and sparkling.  However, it is completely unbalanced.  In a restaurant where the average dish costs $20 - the average glass of wine was also around $20. This made no sense to me.  There were very few reasonably priced glasses.  Don't get me wrong, I like expensive wine, but I was not going to pay as much for wine as for my meal, so we opted for beer."}
{"text":"Yummo!  I had walked past this place when it was still Sagra, and had been meaning to go - finally I did, and the food here was great!  We ordered a few small plates (no pizza - but we should come back for that) including the porcini ravioli, charcuterie board, beet salad with burrata, and a few others.  All of them were fantastic.  The wine list is also pretty awesome.  Apparently in some cases they only have one bottle of a wine, so when it's gone, it's gone!  The staff are super nice here.  

The only caveat: it is reeeeeallly tiny in here so the earlier you can go the better. And it can get a little warm in the summer with the woodburning oven."}
{"text":"For my 30th birthday, I was bowled over by a day of surprises. One of these shock and awe moments came from walking into Annette to find 10 of my best buddies in the back of the restaurant, drinking and eating merrily in front of a light up marquee with my name on it. 

What? Yes, you read that correctly. I have the best partners in crime in the world. 

Later, I was informed that the event was meant to be somewhere else, but the weather was so cold they needed a quick change, and somewhere that had delicious food, could handle the group and the lights... enter Annette Food Market. Their pizzas are superb, their wine list is large and in charge and their servers are lots of fun. I look forward to returning and seeing the restaurant clearly, not just through my excited tears and champagne goggles."}
