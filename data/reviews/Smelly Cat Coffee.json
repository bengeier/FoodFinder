{"text":"I travel a lot for work, and everywhere I go, one of the things I search for is a local coffee roaster.

And there it is, sitting right in the front of a warm, cozy, welcoming shop. I had a pour over, which was measured, timed, etc all to the standard I expect of an excellent coffee shop.  

What REALLY makes this place stand out, though, is their cold brew.  It was phenomenal, without a doubt, in the top three iced coffees I've ever had anywhere in this country.  Even black, it had a smooth, velvety creaminess, while still being refreshing and thirst quenching.   I have no idea how they do it.  I've had 24 hour brew. I've had Guatemala (where their current beans were from, I guess).  I've had cold brew that uses that same drip grind size. Nothing NOTHING has been as outstanding as what Smelly Cat puts out.  I'm simply blown away, still, a week later.

Otherwise, cafe space was clean, spacious, cute with mismatching chairs and tables, and a stack of board games. Folks were sitting both inside and out, and (gasp) conversing with each other instead of having their heads stuck in laptops. 

The staff were beyond friendly, kind, and helpful in suggesting places to check out in the neighborhood.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I'll be at this place in a heartbeat to try their cortados, shots, and whatever else they can do."}
{"text":"A lovely place. Great coffee, especially the cold brew! The staff is always delightful and friendly. Love the outdoor seating.  The inside is cozy and they play good music. This is definitely my favorite little spot to relax in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times! The coffee is always on point, everything from the dirty chai, to mocha, both iced and hot. Their breakfast is good too. We've had the different biscuit combos and the burritos (my favorite is the bacon, egg, and cheese). We had the breakfast casserole before it was permanently on the menu, if it's the same one that's on the menu now, it was AMAZING!

My favorite drink: mocha frappe with skim and a squirt of peppermint"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Friendly staff, delicious coffee, delicious pastries, and a great experience. Honestly, we planned to just go in and sit down for maybe 5 minutes to have a cup of coffee, but we ended up staying and talking to Cathy for about 45 minutes. You can feel her passion for coffee and for her customers in the way she talks. She walked us through her entire roasting process and even let us taste the coffee beans! It's definitely a welcoming environment, unlike a lot of coffee shops that just want to get you through the line and out the door. 

We had the cuban and cortadito, which were both delicious, and Cathy also gave us samples of both of their nitro cold brews. Having tried them before, I was completely against nitrogen-infused coffee, but theirs will change your mind! Both were very delicious and were infused with just the right amount of nitrogen, not over infused like other places that give it that almost beer-like taste. 

If we lived around here, we would be in here every day!"}
{"text":"Not dog friendly as it says here. Did not allow me to bring my service animal into the shop. The cashier had us waiting in order to get a receipt, and there were people outside smoking weed. Originally it had a great feel but it overall was a bad experience. Definitely not Fido friendly."}
{"text":"This little coffee house is my favorite. The only place in Charlotte that offers a Cuban coffee or a Miami Cuban coffee, which are almost the exact same. Every time I am this part of town you will find me here, and always love introducing people to the cute coffee house. I wish I could give it more stars. The employees are outstanding and extremely nice. Love this place."}
{"text":"Friendly people, easy parking. I just got a tea, so I can't vouch for hand crafted drinks, but I'd go back."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is an okay coffee shop. Maybe everyone else hyped it up to much and my high expectations weren't met, but after going there a couple times nothing really impressed me. Not to say that I ever had a bad experience. The staff has always been nice. The drinks are good, though sometimes they take a while to be made.

The inside of the shop feels a little cramped to me, but I am 6,2 so I could just be me. The interior is dim and comfortable, though they lack an of the nice big sofas some other Charlotte coffee shops have. The outside seating is sparse and the view isn't very impressive. There is some sore of \"art?\" garden outside that could be mistaken for trash.

All and all, you can get a good cup of coffee for you and a friend. It's not really the place for groups. If you are in NODA and need a caffeine fix, Smelly Cat is the place."}
{"text":"Great , friendly atmosphere. They brewed a pour over I requested , excellent! 

Best coffee I've had in Chatlotte. They roast the coffee in the shop."}
{"text":"The coffee is great as usual, but now they've added fresh cooked breakfast items! I've tried almost everything and my favorite is their fresh made everything bagels with bacon and egg. And the items are setup to be taken on-the-go."}
{"text":"I visited Smelly Cat Coffee house recently and had a great experience.  I ordered an iced chai latte with almond milk which was creamy and packed plenty of flavor.  Just the right amount of spices.  As noted by another yelper, the crushed ice was a welcomed surprise.  The coffee shop is cute with indoor and outdoor seating.  The baristas are friendly and free parking is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Good coffee in CLT happy with my plain iced americano. Neat scene to sit down and catch up with friends. Quaint small coffee joint."}
{"text":"Can't talk shit about smelly cat. It's perfect place to get coffee and imagine that you aren't in Charlotte anymore."}
{"text":"When I walked into the Smelly Cat, I thought I had finally found a nice coffeehouse in Charlotte (visiting from Seattle for a week).  I liked the funky decor, the brick walls are covered with old doors and other interesting nick knacks, and they use more old doors to separate some of the tables into booths, with electrical outlets.  Outside it was sunny and there are nice little tables to sit at.

The first sign of trouble though, was when I asked for a \"cappuccino for here\", and was told they only had to go cups, but \"they did plan to get real cups sometime this year\", if I wanted paper cups, I would have gone to Starbucks.

The second sign was when I picked up the cappuccino and felt it's weight, there was clearly very little foam, and obviously was more of a latte, again I could have just gone to Starbucks and got one of their \"wet\" cappuccino's.

The final straw though was when I tasted it, it had hints of that taste you get in coffee from a run down truck stop.  I am not sure if they don't clean their machine or what, but it actually made me crave the corporate coffee.

I recommend that anyone visiting Charlotte to try Fabo in Selwyn Corner instead, it at least tastes a little better than the corporate stuff."}
{"text":"I love how customer service oriented this place is. I went in last thursday and they were having a wine tasting later in the evening. I ended up recieving a complimentory truffle to account holders. It was a sweet gesture and the truffle was really pleasent. 

Their flavor of the day roast that they have been doing ::Pumpkin Spice:: is absolutely a hit with me. The flavors dont taste at all artificial and it is so season appropiate. I love their Kona and Guatamalan blends they occasionally have. 

Great Coffee shop, wonderful place to chat the day away."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee house. The reviews don't lie-the dirty chai is perfect. Coffee bean burlap bags cover the ceiling under exposed beams, while the walls are lined with \"booths\" made with recycled wooden doors. The drink menu is small, but covers the essentials. The atmosphere was quiet (Friday late morning) with people studying intently and Bob Marley playing intermittently between bouts of silence. I was disappointed with the food selection. The items are pre-made, wrapped in foil and kept in a glass case display warmer, reminding me of late night drunken 7-11 visits in my early 20s. There were maybe 3 different types of pastries in a similar (empty) case. I had the southwest burrito which was lukewarm, but tasted good and did the job, but I won't order it again. I will, however come back for that dirty chai!"}
{"text":"I only went twice, but the breakfast sandwich was great and filling and the latte was perfect. My biggest problem with Starbucks has always been that they burn their espresso beans and it just doesn't take good; Smelly Cat has such a perfect latte, I never add anything to it.

Also, cool atmosphere and a great place to go for my first time in Charlotte. Thanks so much."}
{"text":"Nice coffee, quaint atmosphere, and reasonably priced. However, I'm afraid most of the staff may drop dead at any moment because they're all dangerously skinny. If those guys aren't vegan then they need to see a doctor. If they are vegan, then they need to stop. If vegetarians laugh at your diet then you probably shouldn't do it. 

Oh, try their milkshake, it'll change your life."}
{"text":"By far the best customer service I've ever had..hands down.  My husband and I went here for the first time today after I had heard some great things about this coffee shop.  I ordered the iced dirty chai latte which they are known for.  I personally wasn't a fan of it..there was some sort of spice in there that didn't agree with me.  I want to note that many many people LOVE this drink so I encourage you to still try it even though I didn't care for it.  I don't believe it was anything they did wrong it just was not my personal favorite.  I was a little nervous to ask for my money back but figured I'd at least ask since I knew I wasn't going to be able to drink it.  Cathy (the owner) was extremely nice.  She asked if they could remake it for me or if I wanted to try something else on top of her giving my money back for the drink..I told her that was okay (I already felt bad for returning the drink!). Then on top of that she encouraged me to come back and try something else and the drink would be on the house.  I've never received such great customer service and encourage anyone to give this place a try.  The next time I'm in the area I will try a different drink.  They also roast their own coffee and offer almond and soy milk which I appreciate since dairy milk does not agree with my stomach.  Terrific owner!"}
{"text":"Funky little spot in which we found by luck. I had the caramel frap and I must say it hit the spot. The girl at the counter said they made their syrups and caramel, I indeed could taste the \"home made\" in it. The caramel was sweet and even a tad-bit salty which made it even better. 
Finding a parking space was no problem, which is always a bonus. It being a Saturday night they were having a group of people doing spoke word session, which made us have a good laugh and added more personality to this coffee shop. 
Got 3 coffees, and 4 pastries for less than $30 and had a great time. 
Will be back soon for more caramel fraps!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. The atmosphere is fantastic, the coffee is always good and you just never know who you're going to run into. ALL the staff is accommodating, helpful and friendly. If you've not been, you are missing out on one of the Queen City's best kept secrets!"}
{"text":"I used to love Smelly Cat because their coffee was excellent and their baristas were really awesome and knew all sorts of things about coffee that I couldn't even begin to understand yet still found fascinating (possibly due to excessive caffeine levels making everything super exciting).  

Their coffee is still good and their baristas are still wonderful, but lately, they have been enforcing more and more policies about their bathroom and parking situations that just make them seem less welcoming.  Having to go back out into the rain to put my signed time-stamped receipt on my dashboard so that I'm allowed to keep my car there for two hours is not okay.  I understand the bathroom code because according to one of their baristas, some not-okay activities were happening in there, and I even understand having to ask for the wi-fi, but it's borderline rude to make customers feel like they have to validate their presence in your establishment.  Sure, parking is tight but it's NoDa and parking is an issue everywhere-that's the nature of the beast.  

Anyways, they have good coffee, but I'm a little disappointed in their new customer policies.  It's less annoying to just go to Amalie's and put up with the ridiculous weekend crowds."}
{"text":"Smelly cat stinks. The espresso was horrible and borderline undrinkable. However I did hold out hope for the bag of beans I purchased. There was no information on the bag regarding roast level and region / location of the beans. As soon as I opened the bag I realized I shouldn't of purchased. The beans were burnt or to be generous a very dark roast. If you are passing through like I was skip this place and go to ANY other coffee shop."}
{"text":"By far my favorite coffee shop in Charlotte! The service is typically always quick, the coffee is amazing and they'll actually take the time to explain a drink to you if you're not sure. Their pastries and breakfast sandwiches are delicious and I haven't even mentioned the coffee yet! Roasted in house this is by far some of the freshest you will find in the area, do yourself a favor and pick a bag up to take home!"}
{"text":"Great coffee. Lovely ambiance. Great place to catch up with friends or take a few moments out of your day to unwind. Also, the artwork changes out, so you get to scope out lots of artists."}
{"text":"I visited this coffee house on two occasions during my last visit to Charlotte.  Conveniently placed in the commercial area of NoDa, this place features coffee roasted in-house. We didn't see much in the way of food beyond a few pastries, but I think the coffee makes up for that. I had a café au lait, with the dark roast (which I highly recommend). The flavor was robust and fresh, and the milk was scalded and not overly frothed in the cup, which is what one should expect with that order. My partner had a hazelnut latte, which he described as having light, airy foam that he felt was like sipping into a cloud.

The atmosphere was friendly and artsy. We had the choice of sitting inside or outside, and frankly, we did both.  The inside has outlets at every table for customers bringing laptops, and there are a few benches and tables outside as well.

We will definitely return when we come back to Charlotte to see this place develop!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, and it's a great place ... my favorite cafe in NoDa or Plaza/Milwood! The ambience is really wonderful, as is the service. And, unlike certain places I won't name, they play great (but not overly intrusive) music! A big shout-out to Kyle, who just made some extra effort to brew a special iced-tea I wanted to check out, and a shout-out to all the other baristas. They're friendly and genuinely cool (that is, without the annoying \"i'm too hip to do to much work or make chit-chat\" attitude you sometimes encounter elsewhere)."}
{"text":"Blackberry Frappe is my favorite but I tried their Cortadito Cubano today and it definitely gets my Hispanic stamp of approval!  I have no reservations about this shop. Great staff, helpful coffee tips for us noobs, great music, and a warm vibe that inspires creativity."}
{"text":"I love a cozy, funky coffee shop, and this is one. The kind of place you just want to hang out in all afternoon. Even though I don't live in Charlotte, it felt like a friend was going to just come walking up to chat.

The pumpkin cake was yummy with all the cream cheese, perfect with afternoon coffee."}
{"text":"Given the only thing I've gotten here is various types of ice creams, this place is amazing. The service rocks and the prices are reasonable, while the atmosphere screams cozy coffeehouse. The T-shirts are pretty cool too, I love nothing more than to stop by here and get a desert after I get dinner at Boudreaux down the street :) Very nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Good location in NoDa, the only coffee shop in CLT to offer on-site roasting- big thumbs up!

The coffee is very good, a little inconsistent- sometimes grounds in the bottom of the espresso, sometimes slightly bitter- but no big deal. The staff are quite friendly but aren't as open as other coffee shops, don't tell you about their coffee- but again, no big deal!  

The vibe is very welcoming and enjoyable, a good stop for some good coffee."}
{"text":"With a name like Smelly Cat, I have to admit I wasn't really sure if it'd be that good, but I decided to give it a try for the sake of Friends. It's a cute little place with a sweet outdoor area and decorated with its namesake animal, cats (but not smelly). I love the fact that they roast their own coffee and that there was a coffee roaster in the shop itself.

I decided to try a Vietnamese cold brew coffee out of curiosity since I've never seen that offered anywhere else, and it was delicious and served over crushed ice. My bf got a medium roast coffee and said it was pretty good too. 

Friendly barista, cute coffee shop, delicious coffee with CRUSHED ICE--all reasons why I will make a point to come back here whenever I'm in Charlotte next."}
{"text":"First off, I hate coffee and always have. Let's just get that on the table.

When my friends wanted to stop here for some coffee, I figured I'd just sit with a bottle of water and wait for them to finish. But then I noticed that hot cocoa was on the menu. As it was December and in the 40s, it seemed like a nice fit.

HOLY CRAP. There were chunks of real chocolate in there, AND I was asked if I wanted peppermint in it. Seriously? All this time I thought I was the only weirdo putting peppermint in hot cocoa. No one's ever OFFERED it before! It's like the mother ship was calling me home.

This heavenly concoction was thick and full of flavor. I know no one's ever made a claim to fame by having the best hot chocolate, but this place totally could.

The environment is quaint as well. It's quite eclectic, with several nooks and tables for you to settle into with a good book. 90s music tends to play frequently, and the staff is very nice.

A year later the same group of us found ourselves in Charlotte again, and I refused to leave without stopping at Smelly Cat for the best hot cocoa in the universe."}
{"text":"Love this place so so much!

From their pastries, to their hot chocolate & coffees!

The ambiance is also something unique and amazing. I love quirky little coffee houses, an my only wish was that it was closer to me!

The service is always great & the coffee comes out quick without the taste being compromised.

Definitely a place I'll drive almost 30 min to, just for the coffee. Yum!"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect. Free wifi great coffee and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just got tea but it was awesome! Love the vibes and friendliness of the staff. Kind of lost walking in but they were very patient and helped walk me through their offerings."}
{"text":"Coffee not at a chain is hard to find in charlotte. I love buying local and on my days off. I am more than willing to drive the extra ten minutes to get it. The coffee is the best I've found in town and the service is equally great."}
{"text":"I was passing through Charlotte again and decided to pay another visit to the Cat.  My first review (which I would urge you to read for the humor alone) documented Lattegate.  They have pretty baristas here - today the beauty of the barista split me down the middle like a battleaxe.  Yes, I just compared being struck by beauty to being split with a battleaxe.  I wonder if that is \"awesome\" or not.  Some choose Cupid - I apparently choose Viking imagery.

Anyway, this time I ordered your regular ol' coffee and realized that the beans are from Dilworth.  Dilworth is a place that I absolutely savaged in a Yelp review because I felt that it wasn't what it was advertised to be, but you'll note that I never had a problem with the beans, which is an arena where Dilworth truly does a good job.  I'm glad that Smelly Cat is sourcing beans from a local, high quality roaster.  

The cup was great; I then realized that there was a wine rack on the wall.  Malbec, what what?  Yes please.  I must have missed this aspect of Smelly Cat before.  They had a malbec from Argentina that was very tasty.  This is one of the grape varietals used in production of Bordeaux within France and is popularly grown in Argentina - I am digging malbec these days.

I followed up my coffee and wine by bashfully approaching the barista to ask about the wifi.  It's a password-protected wifi system.

In the end, Smelly Cat is my home base in Charlotte as far as coffee is concerned.  As long as life keeps dragging me through Charlotte I'll be stopping by."}
{"text":"I visited here once and really like the coffee here. However, I have gone back two other times and left without getting coffee because I could not find a parking space. That is a huge headache that will prevent me from going back. Coffee is good but not that good for me to circle the establishment for ten minutes looking for parking."}
{"text":"Good local coffee shop where they roast their coffee. My fave is New Orleans cold brew with cream.. Had a good time \"hangout\" with the owner during Charlotte Coffee Crawl event.. Definitely a coffee shop you need to stop when you're in the area."}
{"text":"My first time to Smelly Cat was just the other day. I had heard lots of great things about this little coffee shop for quite some time and though i'd better check it out. Well I definitely was not disappointed! This is a real, authentic coffee shop with a great vibe and funky decorating. The woman at the counter kindly helped me decide on a soy dirty chai, something i've never had before but I put my trust in her! It was one of the greatest drinks i've ever had....the chai here is amazing, you must try it! Smelly Cat is a great place to study or just hang out, the staff are cool and friendly, and the coffee is beyond amazing. 
Stop going to chains and try this place!"}
{"text":"My first Charlotte coffee shop visited. Love the vibe--inside and out. Always clean and friendly! Barista was excited to share cold brew samples with me. Tasty coffee. Nice seating. Good music choices. Adequate internet. I have enjoyed studying here. Great location. Parking can be hard, but with a little walk, it's not a problem."}
{"text":"Went there twice while in town for the Belk Bowl.  My wife and I are hooked and secretly hoping the team goes to the same bowl again so we can have some awesome coffee and hot chocolate.  Definitely a MUST VISIT if you're in town."}
{"text":"I've been digging on Smelly Cat for about a decade now. It's a fun little spot and it's nice to see how they've grown and changed over the years. I love that they now offer \"real food\" that they make in house, meaning I can get breakfast, lunch, and light supper items there in addition to their pastries. One big difference compared to some mom and pop coffee places in the city is that they make their own syrups. I'm IN LOVE with the coconut syrup! The only challenges I've ever had are finding a (good) table [it's very small and popular location so space is at a premium, especially if it's too cold or hot to sit outside] and parking. 

In Summary:
+ Fantastic Coffee!!!
+ Friendly staff/Good Service
+ Okay pastry/ Good Veggie Chili!
+ Vegan/Vegetarian Friendly
+ Quaint eclectic atmosphere (although very small)
- Parking challenges"}
{"text":"First time going to this coffee house. I've heard so much about this place so I thought I give it a try. It was amazing! I had the Dirty Chai with soy. Very good and very nice people. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Any time I get coffee anywhere else (*cough*starbucks*cough*), I regret not going to Smelly Cat. They make great espresso drinks, amazing hot chocolate and brew great coffee. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is really chill. A great place to sit and do some work or hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I typically enter into a coffee shop with the hope of getting a delicious cup of coffee or espresso. I arrived at the Smelly Cat with this expectation and was severely disappointed. The coffee was very bland and my friend who ordered espresso was also disappointed in her order. It is definitely a cool place to hang out, despite our lack of proper caffeine buzz we played Scrabble for at least two hours. There are board games to be played and it would be an excellent place to study with some goodies on-hand to nosh on. I would not recommend Smelly Cat for a delicious or satisfying cup a joe."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in all of Charlotte. The coffee is great (especially since they started roasting themselves), and the staff is fun. They're also great with recommendations. Every now and then I just want to try something totally new, and everything they've recommended has been delicious.

The cuban coffee is a must, but they make the best soy dirty chai over ice that I have EVER had."}
{"text":"This is the coolest little coffee shop I've found, they always have cool art and they have a great menu and coffees, love it here."}
{"text":"A nice place to sit outside and people watch. Had the dirty chai and would return again for that. The chai was a nice blend not candy sweet."}
{"text":"I was hanging out in NODA a couple of times listening to music, drum circles and heard this one man band inside smelly cat. Of course if you have watched Friends, you know Fibi and her song. So this man had his knees strapped with symbols, hands on his guitar, Mic with a harmonica, and feet tapping on the drums below. He could sing too. Coffee was great. Many flavors, I think there were scones. Cozy walk up place. Noda is all park and walk around."}
{"text":"Excellent independent coffee shop.  Hometown feel with NoDa culture.  Staff is friendly and the locals are interesting.  Good place to relax or have laid back business meeting.  Free Wifi and rocking chairs don't hurt either."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the Queen City, hands down. I love coming here early in the morning, never once will you meet a rude barista in this coffee house. The staff are always so friendly and perky. Watching them roast the beans in front of you is always a treat."}
{"text":"The barista was very nice. The space is really cute. The tea latte I ended up with was tasty. And the price for it was very modest.

However, they were out of decaf espresso, so they couldn't make decaf coffee drinks. And despite the reviews talking about gluten-free treats, they didn't have any. So I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful local coffee shop!  The fact that amazing cold brew coffee is just a couple of blocks away from my house is like a dream come true.  Friendly staff, they roast their own beans, my wife loves the lattes, and there are some nice seating options (though they are few).  Highly recommend Smelly Cat if you want a great cup of coffee, latte, or cold brew!"}
{"text":"Good cafe.  Great area and vibe.  Too bad they sold out of my size of t-shirt.  Oh yeah, the coffee was excellent.  Had the sweeten sled New Orleans iced and it was superb."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat Coffee is a cool little spot in one of Charlotte's \"hip\" spots called NODA. The interior of the place is equally as \"hip\". I've actually seen people hanging out here with their cats on a leash which I thought was pretty fitting. I would love to hang out here with my laptop and do some work but there is one thing that RUINS this place for me... 

The coffee is terrible!

I am a bit of a coffee snob so take my review with a grain of salt. I don't drink lattes or frozen drink I like a plain cup of black coffee. I've been here twice and both times it was impossible to finish my cup of coffee because I was so bad. It's so bitter and acidic! I have yet to try a good cup of coffee here. It's comparable to gas station coffee, just a step above.

So go hang out here but don't get a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Charlotte. Artsy feel, friendly baristas, and a great place to relax, have a conversation, or study. So good. My personal favorites are: Mocha Frappe, Caramel Apple Cider, Toasted Coconut Frappe, and the various teas Smelly Cat offers."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite coffee house in Charlotte.  The atmosphere is eclectic and inviting.  The place has a lot of older type couches and chairs which also make it unique.  As far as the coffee itself goes, it is always strong and fresh.  I have had espresso drinks and just regular brewed coffee and all of the drinks have been made perfectly.  I wish I lived a little closer, as I would visit more often.  If you want a coffee shop that is off the beaten path, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great place to work or study. Good coffee, tea, and beer selection. 

Can get a little crowded at times, but clears out quickly.

Accessible parking in their lot. If parking lot is full, you can find parking on the street easily."}
{"text":"So cute. I was in town with my boyfriend for the weekend and ended up in the NODA area for some food. We decided to walk around a little afterwards to look for some coffee and found this gem. It is a little standalone building with a creative logo that you can't miss! I would definitely see myself here often if I lived in the area. There is seating indoor and outdoor so it is a great little place to get some work done, enjoy some time to yourself, or have a chat with some friends while drinking some good coffee."}
{"text":"Definitely the best coffee house we've been to so far in NC!  The owner is personable, the coffee fresh roasted and delicious, and the ambience very relaxing. We will be back - probably frequently!"}
{"text":"Tried the sweet New Orleans cold brew, southwest burrito and choice cheddar scone. All were delicious!"}
{"text":"Perfect fit for Noda neighborhood of Charlotte... don't take the \"Cat\" for granted; our little 'hood wouldn't be the same without her!  Great coffee, great baristas all right here within walking distance of all our other great Noda spots!"}
{"text":"A representative from this restaurant responded to my review both publicly and via message telling me that their employee offered me items that they did not and that I received \"on point\" service and that my review was unwarranted. Their employee lied to them. We were not offered any such items. I wish we had been as they do sound delicious and would have likely saved our experience. We looked at the menu offerings, ordered several items to which she only repeatedly responded \"so sorry we are out of that.\" Smelly Cat's combative and \"customer is wrong\" response to my review only furthers my negative opinion of this restaurant and it's staff. I am simply a visitor from out of town looking for a good breakfast experience who was sorely disappointed. I have no reason to lie, but the employee does. The restaurant management would be better served addressing their employee performance and dishonesty rather than acting like they were there when they were not and treating disappointed customers with hostility."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, artsy neighborhood, good coffee. They offer 3 daily brews, including one flavored brew. The iced coffee is tasty, as well."}
{"text":"Oh Smelly Cat, can I come live in your space? I can bake the gluten free treats you offer along with your other pastries, stock your cooler with Odwalla and blynk organic products that you provide, clean for you plus treat you really well. I would make sledge hammers within a minute, give spectacular service and make sure your paintings done by local artists would sell. I would make sure all the little pods you have are spotless and that the Wi Fi was working so free wireless for everyone! I can give you the love you really need Smelly Cat, the love you deserve. You have been so good to me in the past with the aromas of various brewed coffees, reasonable prices and kitschy design, I feel like it's the least I could do for you. 

Let's turn this dream into a reality. Love, 

Tiffany"}
{"text":"Smelly Cat,  Smell-y cat...it's not your fault that you will like this place.  Breakfast items are very good and the coffee hits the spot.  

The one-off menu items that I have tried are also very good.  The pumpkin/banana bread is a nice complement to the coffee.

Worth the drive and dealing with the wanna-be hipsters on the way there."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my afternoon at Smelly Cat.  They've got all of the markings of the hip coffee shop experience: local artists' work as well as other types of quirky flair on the walls, little multicolored tables and chairs, just-off-mainstream but still pleasant music, thoughtfully planned nook/booth seating so you can sip your drink and work in your own private little world.  On the other hand, they also actually had friendly and helpful service, a welcome break to some previous hipster coffee shop experiences I've had in the past. I had a wonderfully refreshing iced tea and a slice of rich cheesecake, and I noticed that they also offer ice cream, all variety of espresso drinks and vegan treats (if you're into that kind of thing).  I do see how coming by at the wrong time could be a problem, what with the somewhat limited seating options, but I guess that's the price one pays for cozy."}
{"text":"I stopped by this coffee house to get some work done. They were unable to make pour overs at the time of my visit, so I ordered a cafe au lait. The coffee was ok, the setting was cute, and they blasted 80's music the entire time I was there. I liked that this place has plenty of parking spaces, free wifi, and plenty of tables/chairs to get work done indoors or outdoors!"}
{"text":"I've posted up at Smelly Cat a few times now for weekend work sessions and I've really enjoyed it. Their coffee is better than most that I've had in the city and their pastries are quite good as well. I've only ever been on the weekends but they get quite a bit of foot traffic here. 

The baristas are very nice. It's a relatively standard set up with about 8 tables (three fun little alcoves) and one bar where sometimes people can sit and sometimes they have baristas using the Chemex. It can get crowded when everyone is standing around waiting for their drinks to be ready, but they work quickly. There is also some outdoor seating which is lovely, either on the sidewalk or the side of the building facing the parking lot. They always have music playing and I personally think they have good taste. My only complaint is the tables are a bit small (though admittedly, my laptop is enormous) and the AC is always WAY too high. 

I will keep going back because I dig the ambience and the coffee ain't too shabby."}
{"text":"Great area (NoDa). I'm a full time student, and this is an incredible place for me to come, kick back, and study for a little while. The coffee is delicious, though a bit overprices compared to some of the competition in the area.

Definitely recommend if you are wanting to try something new and unique."}
{"text":"I didn't have coffee but my wife got a cup, cool little place and quick service. The staff really knows there coffee right down to the flavor notes the different beans are giving off. She always gets coffee from there when we are in NODA during the day. I really like how they roast their own beans. Next time we are in NODA, Ill have to get a coffee as well."}
{"text":"A cute little spot hidden in NoDa. Love meeting friends here for coffee or just catching up on some laptop work here."}
{"text":"Cool location and the best cup of coffee on our trip. Cool shirt and mug bought there too, but a bit pricey for the swag though.

Gal ringing us up was very apathetic, but that was her and didn't affect the product one bit. 

Would definitely come back if passing through again."}
{"text":"As much as I enjoy the always popular Starbucks and the lesser known Caribou Coffee, Smelly Cat is a wonderful change of pace.  The decor is awesome, the service is fantastic and, most importantly, the coffee is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Best Parts
1. High quality coffee
2. Best biscuits in town
3. Nice ambience inside and many chairs to use outside the shop. Cool place to hang out for coffee date or chat with friends 
4. Convenient varieties of coffee and chai

Bad parts
1. Minimal parking spots
2. Only bottle beers available"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, I buy bags of beans, frappes, smoothies! Always delicious and always a pleasant experience! Nice cozy atmosphere with good tunes to listen to, bring your laptop or tab!! Toasted coconut frappe is my fave ;)
had an instance or two where the beans were too dry, but still a very good brew"}
{"text":"I wish I liked this place better than I do. Coffee is just ok and it always takes forever to get my coffee, no matter how busy or not busy it us. There always seems to be a conversation going on with the barista and a local that distracts from my service. That said; the place is cute with only a few tables and a small outdoor area. But I guess if you live in NoDa and you need your coffee fix and Amelie's is not an option...here you go."}
{"text":"Great Dirty Chi and funky atmosphere. The Hubbs and I drive from 25 min away just to get a coffee and hang out. Worth a little drive."}
{"text":"Lacking. This was not the worst cup I've ever had, but the place left a lot to be desired.  I opted for their Ethiopian off a V60 , and when I prodded the girl at the counter for a little more info about it, i.e. where was it grown, she looked at me crooked and said \"Ethiopia\". Inspiring.  Another woman behind the counter who sort of looked like she could have been the owner said that was a valid question, but didn't know the answer and didn't bother to find out. The technique on the pour itself was poor. Splashing water over grounds does not make good coffee... Especially when half the water is poured straight down the filter. These folks need proper training. The cup itself was marginal. Under extracted likely due to bad technique, and the characteristics of the cup were such that, to me, suggested the roast had gone too long in the drum, slightly carmalized and somewhat scorched.  Lacking the bright acidity that draws me to beans from this origin.  Considering the near non existent coffee culture I guess there's not a ton of motivation for a shop to shine when they can squeak by on a convenient location, but really, if you're going to do something, do it well."}
{"text":"Bar none, this is my favorite Coffee house in the Charlotte metro area. They capture the neighborhood feel of NoDa perfectly. Having recently moved out of the area the one thing that I miss THE most are my daily trips to Smelly Cat.

I have been coming here for many years and I have to say that the group of people that work here are amazing. Forgive me if I misspell  anyone's name....Tony seems to have the roasting business mastered as he roasts all of their beans in house. Not only do I go for a cup daily but I also buy all of my beans for home from here. Tony really influenced my love for this place as he immediately learned my name , my favorite type of roast and it felt to me like each time I stepped in the door that I received amazing service from him. This stretches throughout all of the staff ( the Rachels are the same, super attentive , wonderfully kind and they go out of their way to make my visits great). On top of this the owner is a frequent face within Smelly Cat and within the local NoDa community. She is as pleasant as anyone I have met and I can tell that she has put her stamp on the culture of this business. I sometimes wonder how they are able to keep such a quality staff of people as you don't find this within many businesses, it clearly stands out! 

I will be ordering all of my beans on line from now on and I have already figured out a away to steer my workday through NoDa a couple times a week just so I can still enjoy my favorite spot. The atmosphere is great, the staff are great and the coffee is great...thanks Smelly Cat crew!!!

{"text":"Fun little coffee shop. I was drawn to it by the name, and enjoyed my drinks at it. The parking is not fun around this area. I went during a not so busy time during the day, so there was room to sit inside and enjoy my drink. I have tried to go back since and have had no luck parking. Drinks were good and very well made. Bought my friend some coffee beans to make coffee at home, and they really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"wow this is exactly as a cafe should be. in fact if I ever were to open a cafe, and I often have dreamt of it, this is exactly what i would have done.

charming decor, local artists on display, great music, free wifi, cozy tables, awesome staff, loose leaf tea, cool mugs, and a nice crowd.

love it!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the 'homey-est' vibe of any coffee shop in Charlotte.  (Well, that and Mug's.  But, Smelly Cat is like studio apartment in NoDa homey.  Mug's is kind of like your Grandma's living room homey)

SC is warm, eclectic, and the music they play is dope.  Coffee is solid, too.

I dig it and go here often."}
{"text":"I am a coffee connoisseur I drink nothing but lattes from different coffee houses Starbucks is one of my main ones Cafe Con Leche Cuban style it's another great one but when I had my first one from Smelly Cat Coffee OMG world's best world's best best latte around"}
{"text":"I walked in here after strolling around Noda waiting for lunch time at Cabo Fish Taco. With no line, I decided to order an iced chai - medium. Normally I get 2% milk, but I wasn't sure if they carried, whole, skim, etc. so I asked. They have several different kinds, but what I settled on was Almond milk. It was my first time trying out this combo, and it was delicious! Definitely hit the spot on a warm day, and is now my new favorite drink. Better yet, it was less than $5."}
{"text":"This is a pretty weak excuse for a coffee shop. Even the name of the place is an embarrassment if you ask me. I suppose that they are fans of the show Friends? Menu is unoriginal and over price. The place is a weak imitation of Starbucks; and a rude staff as well! Do not waste your time or money at Smelly Cat."}
{"text":"Such a cute coffee shop by our Airbnb in Charlotte! Stopped in here on our way out of town and wishing I would have found it sooner. The staff was really friendly and the coffee was tasty. I also had a breakfast sandwich that didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Cold brew coffee: 5/5

Chai Latte: 7/5

Zucchini bread: 5/5

This little place is dynamite! Definitely not your average Starbucks wannabe coffee shop. This place has an awesome vibe, a wide variety of pastries, muffins & treats baked in-house. Awesome products, and good prices!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, they have great coffee all around.  And they have soy milk for non-dairy people.  Very cozy atmosphere.  Cool booths made out of antique doors.  A down home kitchen feel but equally appropriate for coffee snobs who would like to go somewhere besides Starbucks for a change.  Not that I have anything against Starbucks, but I'm looking forward to visiting Smelly Cat again."}
{"text":"What a great, local coffee shop! 

Located in the NoDa district, it boasts subtle charm, friendly baristas, and worthwhile coffee. In a sea of Counter Culture coffee shops (which are not unappreciated, ftr), I applaud their independence earned by roasting their own beans in-house (on a 25lb Probat, no less). 

Their music selection is current and trendy, appealing to most 20-somethings. They offer both manual pourovers, ready-brewed air pot coffee, along with full espresso and tea service. The free (passworded) wifi is also a plus. 

If I had one qualm, it's that they serve flavored coffee offerings. Since they prepare all their offerings in-house, the lingering aroma is a little overwhelming. But coffee aficionados: don't let this dissuade you from stopping! They do a fantastic job with their roasts."}
{"text":"I wish Columbia had a place like this! 

I've been to Smelly Cat (what a name!) twice and both times have loved it. I think last night it really took my breath away. 

The reason I'm giving this place five is more for atmosphere than quality of food/drink. To be honest, I've only had a coffee, a tea, and a red velvet cupcake at the coffeehouse so I can't say I've sampled that much. From what I've ordered though, I've been very happy with what I got. As for the service, both times I've been to Smelly Cat, the baristas have been very sweet and professional. 

But to talk about the atmosphere, well, WOW. Especially last night (Friday). I don't know if it's like this all the time, but the place was oozing community and felt so good to be a part of it. When we got there it was around 9pm and we wanted to get coffee and dessert and play a game of scrabble. There were a couple of tables outside and a few wicker benches to choose from. One table was occupied with a group of friends and their very loving and playful dog. Another table had a musician playing the xylophone. At one of the wicker benches, there was a small group playing the guitar. We snagged an empty four top and proceeded w/our scrabble game. Several pedestrians with dogs and children walked by. As the night progressed, a drum circle formed around the xylophone player and they created magical music. Many people who walked by stopped to dance and interact with the musicians. Inside the cafe as more people came in, there were others like us who cracked open board games and drank their coffee and chatted away.  I hate to sound new age, but the energy was astounding, and it was really cool to get to share some of it.

Also NoDa is a beautiful area, so the combination of the neighborhood feel, warm almost summer breeze, the music, and the smell of good coffee, was just priceless."}
{"text":"Great hot chocolate and cortados. Needs better signage. A little small if you were hoping to sit down and enjoy your drink on a cold day, but there is some seating if you get there early."}
{"text":"Cozy space to hang out. I dropped in for some afternoon coffee before walking around the neighborhood to check out what NoDa has to offer.

I gave their Ethiopian brew a try but I wasn't too impressed. I noticed they have a pour over set up after buying a small coffee. Would have ordered a pour over if I had known!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat breakfast and get coffee. I especially like the sausage egg and cheese biscuits. I recommend to anyone to try this place because it's awesome."}
{"text":"Couldn't find a singing Phoebe Buffay, but I did find some friendly folks and coffee sooooo good it'll make you watch Friends re-runs!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Smelly Cat for a while now and unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations.  I'm hoping I just caught this place on a bad night.  It was very slow (only 2 other customers in the place) and there was only one person working.  I ordered my standby, a skinny mocha, and was disappointed.  It barely had any coffee flavor and just didn't taste right for a mocha.  I also tried out one of the delicious-looking chocolate cupcakes which turned out to be just ok.  I'm starting to wonder if cupcakes just aren't my thing.

The part of the visit that makes me want to come back is the cozy and quirky atmosphere.  The decor is really cool with old rustic doors that section off seating areas and plenty of local artwork on the walls.  Although most of the tables I saw during my visit were dirty I have a feeling it isn't always this way.  I want to come back with my laptop or kindle, grab a cup of coffee and stay for a while to see if this place grows on me."}
{"text":"Very good tea, nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. Even working on a Holiday, everyone was enthusiastic and nice to customers. Loved the place."}
{"text":"it was ok. I had to wait 20 minutes for my coffee because it was so busy and they only had 2 people working & then they gave my sisters coffee to somebody else so we had to wait another 5 minutes. It took way longer than it should have. The coffee however was very good. I got the chunky monkey frappe & it was amazing. The costumer service on the other hand was bad as the lady who worked there was rude to everyone."}
{"text":"This seems to be \"The Coffee shop\" in Charlotte based on reviews so I had to give it a try. 

I will say that space is limited inside, but there is also outdoor seating. I personally do not like sitting outside if the weather isn't just right. But that's just me.

I ordered a dirty chai and an egg and cheese biscuit. I found a comfy space and tucked myself into a corner. Both the latte and biscuit were delish.

I would come back here to write. I liked the vibe and the people were very nice."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Smelly Cat Coffee with some friends while we were in Charlotte for the weekend and looking for a caffeine fix on a Sunday afternoon. The name, of course, instantly brings to mind Phoebe from Friends. I ordered a frappe because the weather was nice and I wasn't disappointed. Actually, the only disappointment was that they were out of whipped cream (!). Whoopsies."}
{"text":"Naturally when I even think of Smelly Cat, I want to sing the Phoebe Buffay song from 'Friends'...\"smelly cat, oh smelly cat, what are they feeding you?\" HA, just like you Nicole (I just read your review)! :D
Smelly Cat is always busy...which is a good thing! I've walked here many a time (from further down N Davidson St). Love that they have indoor & outdoor seating; however, on a nice day, you'll see everyone wants to be out on the patio. No Da is the perfect place for this coffeehouse.
I go with the Hazelnut coffee each time & it's yummy!"}
{"text":"Funky little joint that quickly went on my itinerary based on the name alone!
Sweet New Orleans was the iced coffee I got in the store as well as as a bag of NoDA espresso and their dark blend. Haven't broken into those bad boys yet but the place was nice and clean. There weren't any room in the parking lot so I had to park a little in the sidewalks."}
{"text":"I'm a avid coffee drinker and the coffee quality and taste is very important. My lady told me about this place called Noda and Smell Cat popped up. With a list of great reviews I had too try it out. Starbucks can only thrill a coffee lover so much till we need a new unique taste. This place has a amazing ambience and atmosphere. You'll notice private tables and their coffee roaster right in the middle of the store. I've tried two of their blends, Black Cat being my favorite. I took a bag of LLorana home which was a little darker. Very good roasted coffee. I highly recommend. Only problem, too far from my house."}
{"text":"Iced white coconut mocha. Yum! Hubby had blended spiced brown sugar caramel latte.  Delicious.  I'll come every time I'm in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Do you remember Phoebe's song- smelly cat? :)
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat,
What are they feeding you?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat,
It's not your fault

Well this coffee house in Charlotte has no connection to it. :)
Smelly Cat Coffeehouse Roaster is an award-winning local coffeehouse and Coffee Roaster. It's located in the NoDa neighborhood in Charlotte and is very charming and quirky. The coffee house has seating in the front, side of building and inside. The inside is decorated in this rustic farmhouse vibe and is a very cozy space. They have a few nooks inside for seating two. 

The barista that served my friend and I was very pleasant and patient with us. It was our first visit so it took us a moment to decide on our drink of choice  for the hot and humid Sunday afternoon. 

I ended up ordering an ice latte with toasted coconut syrup and almond milk. I took a sip and thought, man oh man, this is a good cup of coffee. The coffee had a smooth and bright flavor, no bitter taste. This would definitely be my go to coffee shop if I lived here. Great coffee, funky atmosphere and good service - love it!"}
{"text":"My conscience is forcing me to review this place. Selfishly, I'd like to keep this little Noda treasure all to myself.  Cannot say enough about Smelly Cat Coffee shop. Superior, friendly staff...excellent coffee and delish pastries. And probably the coolest place to hang out in Charlotte. Super friendly patrons...lots and lots of dog lovers to chat with. And really great outdoor spaces in front and on each side. My one regret: that they're not closer to my place in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is a quaint little spot if you're in the noda area and are in the mood for some good coffee. I do with that they had more seating area since its often crowded during gallery crawls but otherwise its a great spot to chill with your friends and enjoy the noda vibe."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat smells quite delicious-wifts of freshly roasted coffee.  Another flattering review of Smelly Cat seems redundant, but here's my observations about this place

-High \"perk\" factor of baristas-I can't even pull off that level of perkiness with liberal doses of caffeine

-Variety of bevies- Chai lattes, a different flavor of iced tea daily on special, several roast of coffee to choose from.  They keep iced coffee (don't know if its cold press) but it does the trick.  

-Dilworth coffee used in coffee beverage-It's \"dil-worthy\" of praise, wha wha whaaa!

-Smallish-Though I wouldn't likely loiter here for hours, I would certainly visit Smelly Cat on a lunch break or before a big day in NoDa (or night, if you know what I mean).

The overall experience is great.  I like light or medium roast coffee and I find it to be a tad bitter here.  It's really good, but it's not as smooth as I've had in other coffeehouses.  Overall, Smelly Cat makes NoDa what it is."}
{"text":"I always like coming here. Friendly staff, chill environment, good for reading/studying."}
{"text":"A great place to get coffee in NoDa. The staff is always so friendly & they have the best hot chocolate. The set up inside is pretty cute too. There's always a lot of seating outside as well."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot to work on projects and concentrate outside the house. Good coffee, friendly staff, free wi-fi, and comfortable seating. Parking can be hard to come by if there's an event in the neighborhood - most often on Fri/Sat nights or Sunday mornings. The chocolate chip frappe is my favorite drink."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is a nice quaint little spot in the NoDa area. The Frappe I had there was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"ha just like nicole...i sang smelly cat smelly cat the entire ride to the coffee house.  

great selection of drinks, pastries, and super cute atmosphere.  great for hanging out with friends, grabbing a quick drink, or even a business meeting if you want to get away from the chain of starbucks (which i'm not really a fan of)

highly recommend and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Cozy place for drink coffee, work or play some games with friends.
I love their different coffee beans."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is everything - and then some! 

First off.. the name! Gotta love Phoebe! 

Second.. the neighborhood. Love it.

Third.. the decor. So dark and hipstery. Not usually my vibe but it is done so well, here!

Fourth.. COLD BREW. All the cold brews! Like four of em!

Fifth.. beer.

Sixth.. homemade syrups! That toasted coconut syrup is perfection.. coconutty, toasty, and not cloyingly sweet! 

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great little place in Noda. Super cozy and warm. I'm particularly a fan of this place in the fall and winter."}
{"text":"Trendy, but coffee leaves something to be desired. Location is good though and the decor is novel. Okay place, but way overhyped, I don't get it."}
{"text":"What a great find while passing through town! Amazing coffee (they even have Cuban coffee, as well as cold brew on tap) and a super friendly staff. I would love to find more coffee shops like this around the US. 

I will definitely be going back here whenever possible."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in NODA, could smell the fresh coffee from outside. Sat outside with the wife and drank a coconut frappe. Seating was nice and comfortable, inside was cozy. Everyone should visit Smelly Cat Coffee House!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure if I lived in Charlotte I would spend a lot of time here.  Just walking through the door made me smile.  

All around friendly staff, yielding friendly patrons, drinking smooth, rich coffee, eating totally passable baked goods and just all-around putting out some positive coffee house energy.  

If you lived here, you'd be home now"}
{"text":"Michelle and Allison are the dream team baristas! Best iced white mocha in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great coffee and I really love the ambience.
I had the cortadito (Cuban coffee with a touch of foamed milk) and silly me I forgot to mix it up a little so the brown sugar ended up at the bottom of the cup! Still yummy, in spite of my operator error."}
{"text":"Although I have been to NoDa several times in the past, today was my first time going to Smelly Cat. I had a great first experience there and definitely recommend stopping by if you're ever in the area! It's cozy, quirky and even has outdoor seating. 

They have awesome service, and everyone there was so friendly. My friend and I met all the workers on a first name basis and even met Cathy, the owner who is such a sweet lady by the way. They made me feel like I was a regular customer!

There were numerous drinks on the menu but not many pastry choices, which is why I did not give it five stars. By suggestion, I ordered an iced dirty chai in the biggest size they had. It usually comes with four shots of espresso, but I asked for one less shot. I thought it was delicious-- and this is coming from someone who is not so fond of the chai-taste!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte and stopped here mainly because of the name. Very eclectic. Everyone was nice and friendly. The locals drew you into conversation. Right amount of quiet. We split a Apple cinnamon/cinnamon apple muffin that was moist and delicious. Coffee was great. They make their own with this up machine onsite. Would love to come back and just sit for a while."}
{"text":"I was looking for a coffee and this was the highest reviewed, so I came here. I do not live in Charlotte so I had no clue what to expect. I'm not sure what they did to the blended mocha I got, but it was honestly the best coffee I've ever had. 

After being rejuvenated with a cool, caffeinated drink, I tracked down a Lime Scooter and drove all over North Davidson. Thankfully, I didn't get run over. I parked the scooter in front of Smelly Cat, but I'm sure it has been moved since my visit!"}
{"text":"The \"kegged\" cold brew coffee is delicious! Especially if you like the flavor/texture of a good coffee stout."}
{"text":"More of a meeting place for NoDa than a coffee shop (at least to me). The coffee is standard - but you can tell there is a lot of love for what coffee shops represent. And lets face it, you don't really just want a cup of coffee when you're hanging out at Smelly Cat...you want to feel cool that you're drinking coffee in public with your friends and neighbors."}
{"text":"For a non-coffee drinker, going to a coffee shop seems like a dangerous choice, but Smelly Cat still delivered.

Located in Noda, once again, maintaining a charm unseen in other cities, Smelly Cat was a hipster paradise (and I say that in all the best ways). With a modern flair, and comfy seats, I sat at the window to people watch. 

My breakfast on this particular morning was a vegan bar that was perfect size, with a hot cocoa on an otherwise chilly morning in December. There was nothing wrong with the flavors I enjoyed on this particular day, and if you are a coffee drinker I imagine, based on the hot chocolate, that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pricey, but so good. I love love love the friends theme and I worked from there last week. It was nice to just be out of the office in a great coffee shop"}
{"text":"There was an intermittent alternate dimension happening at Smelly Cat over the past couple of days, and it made for great people watching. Case in point: today several groups of fourth graders paraded in throughout the day to read their own poetry, open-mic style. It was quite the site to see, what with all of the rhyming prose and the enraptured listening of the teaching set, and when it was over? Snaps, just like the beats like it. Ginsberg might have been confused, but he might have been proud.

Smelly Cat Coffee House is just what the name implies, a cozy cove of fluffy chairs, enclaves, and cafe tables that make camping out here in NoDa fun. My meetings today flew by, not the least of which was because of the hazelnut Italian soda I slammed, or the arty ramblings of children, or the giant leafblower that careened about when I sat outside for a bit. It's a little on the small side, but you don't have to be gigantic to be a cool coffee room. And as it turns out, if you're here, the ability to snap effectively helps."}
{"text":"Their coffee is good. However.  Asked for a top off and they wanted to charge me for another full cup. This is bad business. You have a 160z cup as a large size with no option for larger. Many people drink 20 to 24oz. There is no question they are losing potential business with this ill-advised policy. Also. Kind of interesting claiming to be an eclectic coffee shop in the heart of NODA while gouging people at the same time. What irony and hypocrisy"}
{"text":"Best americano in Charlotte! The staff is fabulous at this cozy establishment. I had a Mediterranean quiche that was to die for the last time I popped in, and I always just get good all around good vibes here."}
{"text":"Fantasic, cute, coffee place! Amazing frappes and smoothies. Came here with my nephew, brother, sister in law. We each got frappes while my nephew got a smoothie! So tasty and delish! I got the toaste coconut frappe and it literally so was creamy wet and silky smooth! I cant stop thinking about it!

The parking is a complete nightmare mess in the area and there are signs everywhere warning of towing. Smelly cat even suggests putting you recipet on your dash of your car to protect it from towing.

I would be back here in a heart beat! Beat frappe of my life. However, took off a star for the parking. It wasa royal pain and a total frightmare !!!  Be ware !"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the good cappuccino, nice people and cool ambient of the cafe and the whole neighborhood on an early Sunday morning. Also kids-friendly: great cocoa. The name of the cafe is a mystery for me but if they secretly serve Kopi luwak coffee I wouldn't mind :-)"}
{"text":"Smelly Cat Coffee is a cool hip spot in the heart of NoDa!

Great service & environment! I ordered a cortadito and although it wasn't exactly what I'd get back in Miami, it was a good try and tasted great! I also ordered an apple muffin which was the PERFECT morning snack to go along with the espresso. Although I was only there for 20 minutes, the vibe and atmosphere is very welcoming and the perfect spot to read, study, chat and get your morning going. Right in the back of the Cafe, they have a small market on Saturdays which you can check out after you're done. It was definitely a cool spot filled with locals."}
{"text":"This place is everything you want in a coffee shop. Great coffee, great ambiance, great staff - I never want to leave! Try their Vietnamese Iced Coffee!"}
{"text":"My neighborhood favorite! Smelly Cat is the bomb! Every time I walk into this NoDa gem a smile instantly crosses my face. From the delicious Almond Milk Chai Latte (yes they have almond milk) to the awesome service of Miss Frankie & Miss Leah, there is never a time where Smelly Cat does make my day.

Thanks for the yummy caffeine and sorry for all the times that Torrie (of #thesavageway) and I rearrange your tables for work! :)"}
{"text":"Nice, querky stop along the way. Like others have posted earlier, it definitely is eclectic, artsy, and independent. It has good energy, draws a good crowd. Music adds to the chill atmosphere too.

I guess they are pretty open on allowing pets in because a patron brought her dog in with her. The bathroom was clean...always a plus.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I can never have another Starbucks chai latte ever again after having one here. Trust me, I've tried.  Bummer since I just got on that train a few weeks ago. 

The Smelly Cat has a short but delicious selection of lattes, frappes, and smoothies. Their chai latte had so much flavor I couldn't handle. I tried to drink a Starbucks chai latte a few days later but it now tastes watered down and lackluster. 

The cafe itself is decorated with a collection of cat novelty items and other random trinkets. There is wifi and cute outside seating available as well.  I will definitely be stopping by again next time I'm in NoDa :)"}
{"text":"I came here my first time and Charlotte and got their brown butter latte. I literally could not stop thinking about it and had to come back the next time I visited. Good coffee, fun homemade syurps, and an awesome vibe."}
{"text":"Great coffee, fast service, polite staff. They alway great you genuinely and not with a fake forced smile. 
Great outdoor seating but inside is a little cozy."}
{"text":"I got a spiced brown sugar latte and it was very good! Great service and got my drink super fast! Also the atmosphere is just so beautiful! So much detail everywhere!"}
{"text":"I love to support local coffee shops and Smelly Cat makes that really easy.  First, their coffee is great. They have a good selection daily of different brews.  I also like that they offer a daily flavored brew as well.  If your ever in the mood for something a little more mellow, but not a heavy as a flavored latte or mocha, a cup of Hazelnut coffee is the way to go.  I also like their strong sense of local-ism.  It is apparent that they want to support and encourage neighboring businesses.

Another major props to Smelly Cat for roasting their own beans.  This is really impressive and makes 36th Street smell AMAZING.  

Finally, I really like the atmosphere of Smelly Cat.  They have great outdoor seating (with fresh water for my pup) and a really cozy layout inside.  Smelly Cat welcomes and encourages resting and relaxing over a great cup of coffee, a good book and free wifi!"}
{"text":"Probably the best latte in Charlotte. The espresso isn't overpowering or bitter, and they have lots of different syrups that you can try in your drink. I usually go for the toasted coconut. It isn't too sweet or fake tasting. Their pastries are great as well. They always have different seasonal things to try out. The baristas are always nice and the WiFi is fast. The seating isn't the greatest, but I've never had the issue of not being able to find a seat, even during the rush."}
{"text":"A good weather calls for a good cup of coffee .. 
Enjoying my cortado with a very fine company !  
This place offers good ambience and good music with great coffee. 
Also, I bought my first smelly cat coffee mug today :D"}
{"text":"Went here because it was suggested to me from my cousins (who know I'm obsessed with FRIENDS) and I've been here at least 10 times in the past 4 years. Their coffee is good and they make a mean Chai Tea Latte! So good! Also their peanut butter brownie is amazing!!'"}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly staff, helped me pick a great drink and taste some of the cold brews they had. Next time I am in Charlotte I will go again."}
{"text":"The perfect NoDa neighborhood coffee shop.  Free wifi, delicious coffee, ice cream, and delicious (even gluten free) snacks."}
{"text":"We stopped in here while in Noda and I loved the atmosphere of this place. It's dark and atmospheric, some place you could go to get work done. They have their roaster right out in the open which is awesome looking and the seating areas are separated by old doors. I had the hot chocolate and it was really great, super creamy and a good amount of chocolate."}
{"text":"This place is super cool with great customer service. We love to visit NODA and stop here. Frozen drinks today -spot on. You can also buy whole bean coffee they will grind it for you."}
{"text":"The best. I buy their ground coffee to make at home as well. I always recommend it to people and it never disappoint. Dirty Chai is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Smelly Cat (or, Stinky Kitty, as I know it) is a great neighborhood coffee shop.  Small, semi-private booths, couches, and outdoor seating.
Bring your dog, or your laptop, or your friend... or meet some folks when you get there!

Either way, great place in NoDa!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, good shakes, good pastries, good people, great atmosphere. I heart Smelly Cat!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with the mom and pop coffee stores popping up in Charlotte and smelly cat is one of my favorites. The shop is inviting and charming, but their coffee is amazing! 

The cold press is perfect! No sugar or creamer is needed and the vanilla chai tea is to die for!!! They also have some tasty bakery goods. If you go on a early Saturday or Sunday morning you will be able to enjoy it right out of the oven. The zucchini bread is a favorite along with their morning glory bread-which contains cranberries, raisins, carrots and cinnamon!!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, great service and nice environment.  Must try the Dirty Chai, pour over coffee and peanut butter bar is to die for."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee aromas greet you as you walk through the door along with a cheery hi. Service is knowledgeable and friendly.

The free WiFi is always appreciated though the space is a bit tight. Coffee and tea selections were good and prepared well. If more places around here were open for lunch I'd be here more often than I'd like. As it is I treat myself to their fast efficient service whenever I happen to be around the area in the daytime instead.

What's more could you ask for from a neighborhood coffee shop other than maybe an awesome name? Oh wait it's got that too!"}
{"text":"I don't drink coffee, but they have the best hot chocolate in Charlotte.  I'll slap you if you think Starbucks hot chocolate is even average.  

Also, they do have a private lot. I'm not sure why 2 people said you can only park on the street..."}
{"text":"Was visiting Charlotte over the long weekend and was really happy to find Smelly Cat open on a Sunday night and full of people. As someone who can drink coffee and go directly to sleep, I love a good late-night coffee shop. My cortado was perfect, the music was awesome and had me Shazam-ing more than one song, the baristas were super friendly and fast. Wish I could bring this place back to Brooklyn with me!"}
{"text":"Smelly Cat has the best coffee in CLT. Hands down their Black Cat Blend and Triple Threat Espresso are the richest roasts, the most delightfully dark beans you'll get in the Queen City. This mind blowing coffee has always been fresh when I've stopped by for a pick me up and is served up by a friendly staff who are always warm and welcoming. It's a cute place too!"}
{"text":"i came in today thurs the 19th at 1:15 and ordered some chais. They were pretty good but unfortunately the barista who took our order and made our drinks came
off very snarky and condescending which i didn't appreciate. This isn't the only time she has been like that, she's waited on me a few other times with the same better-than-you attitude"}
{"text":"Love this spot - and managed to hit it at a time this afternoon when it was not packed.  We had great coffee, and a great time sitting inside talking and coloring with the provided crayons, including the one with the color name \"pissen lit\", which kept me amused for my entire visit! (french for the dandelion color).  I love the decor which is very cool, and the opportunity to chill for a bit in a with great company, great coffee and the pissen lit crayon!"}
{"text":"The customer service is impressive. The coffee is mediocre, but they keep me going back. They're always helpful and friendly, and the vibe of the place is great."}
{"text":"Great cup of coffee. Fresh roasted, service was quick and friendly.  Not much seating if you want to hang around there."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte I did not know about NoDa, so when 55 scoped this place out he told me I would like it.  He was correct!  This is a cool place with cool customers and Cools as customers which is important in this particular situation!

I like the Espresso and I like the Hot Chocolate even more!  The Staff is always very friendly and have always been successful in making something good for me!

The inside of this place is as cool as the patrons who like hanging out here."}
{"text":"Great coffee drinks, awesome friendly staff, chill comfortable atmosphere and good music. Delicious baked goods with gluten-free options. Wide selection of board games. Outdoor patio and wi-fi, you can't ask for much more in a coffee shop. Private lot parking adjacent."}
{"text":"I love their drinks and their staff.  Unique artwork on the walls, sometimes available for purchase.  Seating is somewhat cramped.

They also have a drum circle outside every Friday from 8:00PM to 2:00AM."}
{"text":"Hip little joint. Had an excellent New Orleans style cold brew--exactly what I didn't know I wanted. Staff was sweet and helpful. Perfect place to while away an hour or two."}
{"text":"This NoDa staple is everything you'd want a coffee house to be.  It is quaint, eclectic, cozy, and it has some of the best coffee you can get anywhere in Charlotte.  As you walk in you'll notice a cabinet with board games so you can grab a cup and hang out for as long as you please while taking a trip down memory lane with a nostalgic game of Battleship.  You'll also notice the tables and booths around the place that make for perfect spots to chill or converse with friends.  

The coffee is as fresh as it gets.  You can't miss the roaster where all the magics happens right there near the counter.  You can get all kinds of fancy hot or iced drinks or keep it simple with a cup of the Tanzanian brew (my personal favorite). 

And the folks there are friendly and unpretentious.  They're helpful if you have questions or wish to venture outside the box to try something new.  Remember to tip!

If you visit NoDa and want the true experience that sums up the soul of the neighborhood, you must stop in here!"}
{"text":"Coffee selection is amazing!  I just wish they had as good of a selection of parking spots. We had to resort to street parking.  Once inside, the environment is quirky and eclectic.  The space was cozy, although at times felt a tad too small.  My friends and I went to Smelly Cat to work on a project.  As soon as we arrived, we realized that this wasn't the kind of coffee house you could be productive at.  Due to the size restrictions, which hence, make the table sizes smaller, we had to enjoy our delicious coffee and relocate.  

Service was friendly and the atmosphere was super chill.  I'd go back for some schmooze time!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! Was really surprised to say the least. The young lady at the cash register was rude unwilling to correct the order. Whatever you do do not expect to get a real Cuban café I tried to explain that what they were serving was not a Cuban café she became insulting to my culture as I just wanted to exchange the café to something else needless to say I will not go back if that's how they treat customers I went during evening hours and I will not suggest anyone else does that's looking for a Cuban café but hey if you want a bad attitude, and terrible service then this is the place for you"}
{"text":"Always a great experience at this wonderful mom and pop coffeehouse.  The baristas are all very friendly and the drinks are great.  I am a big fan of the iced Sweet New Orleans and the Chai tea. Also, it is hard to make a visit there without a slice of the Zucchini bread; it is so delicious."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and coffee is delicious, what more can you ask for!? 

Great spot to grab a coffee, sit out in the sun and relax."}
{"text":"This place definitely delivers when you are looking for a neat little coffee shop in a new town.  I was around the Charlotte area for an interview and I love exploring coffee shops in new places.  

I loved the local art hung up on the walls and the earthy feel of the place.  The people who work there were super cool too - the guys behind the counter gave me a lot of great recommendations.  Not only do they sell awesome coffee drinks there but they also serve alcohol - unfortunately I could not imbibe.  I got their pumpkin spice latte and it was amazing.  I also brought some work with me and was able to be productive in my quiet corner of the shop.

Definitely check this place out if you need somewhere to chill downtown!"}
{"text":"Quite an adorable coffee establishment and the only one in the neighborhood (it seemed) on a Saturday at 11am. Service is friendly and the line moves pretty quickly. 

The chai latte I ordered was decent. A little heavy on the milk and not so much chai flavor, but still an ok choice. I would probably order a latte the next time around though. My friend went with the peach smoothie, which she said was \"okay\" too. 

I bought a mixed berry scone to go with the latte, which actually turned out to be rather disappointing. The texture of the scone was mushy rather than crumbly and the mixed berry flavor was faint. They didn't have a good selection of pastries (which was slightly disappointing). My almost $7 breakfast was an \"A-ok\" in my book, so 3 stars it is!"}
{"text":"One of the staples of NoDa that I finally got around to checking out this morning. I was in the neighborhood looking at a house and figured I would swing by on this beautiful day, get a coffee, and do some reading! I did not get adventurous on my selection, just a regular latté, but when the latté is delicious there is no need to get experimental.

The inside is very cozy with some small tables for 2-4 people and some comfy chairs as well. Like I mentioned, I sat outside where there is also a lot of seating (probably more than inside). You can always tell the popularity of a place by the audience they serve. All sorts of people went in and out of Smelly Cat in the time I was there, and I loved it. Nothing brings people together like coffee!"}
{"text":"great atmosphere. nice and small and cute. not a lot of traffic coming in and out not noisy"}
{"text":"Maybe a take out of Friends the TV show yet this is a TRUE coffee house! Nestled in the artsy part of Charlotte called Noda, this place embodies what an independent coffee house should be like. Great coffee and atmosphere!  I will be back many times."}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop for coffee while visiting Charlotte. The owner stopped to chat with us and showed us the coffee roaster. Overall very friendly atmosphere and great coffee. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After trying all of the big hitters, I would rank Smelly Cat as the best coffee in town. The location oozes edgy, which partly comes with being right in the heart of NoDa. The baristas all ad to the vibe with the friendly quirky natures, and possess the ability to make a sublime latte. They usually have Ethiopian blends which is my personal favourite thing about Smelly Cat, but they also have a lot of other unique brews from all around the world which makes each visit seem like a new adventure."}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop located in NODA. I had the iced dirty chai which was good. My husband had their Costa Rica pour over which he felt was ok. They roast their own beans. Seating is limited and an outlet was not working but other than that everything was clean and staff was nice!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Charlotte for the Spartan this past weekend. We stopped here for coffee and sat inside since it was raining. Love the atmosphere here. The baristas were all very nice. They let me try their different cold brews before deciding on one. 
The music was on point. 90s throw backs. Really can't ask for much more from a coffee shop. The coffee itself wasn't the best Ive ever had, but the location and atmosphere made up for it. 

Usually there is a Farmers Market behind here that runs on Saturdays. We were going to try and check it out but it was raining so no one showed up. Super bummed!"}
{"text":"I love coffee...but more than that I love a unique atmosphere and supporting local businesses.  They make the best Chai...whether u get it iced or hot, in Charlotte. I have found myself waking up on a weekend and craving Smelly Cat...it truly makes the start of a nice weekend.  They have some bakery items for sale..but not a big selection;  I have tried the banana nut muffin and it's quite yummy. The staff is fun and I love that they use the Ipad when u check out...so tech savvy!
I hope I can stop in sometime this week!"}
{"text":"I went to this coffee shop simply bc its name caught my eyes. It's located in the Noda area (which parking can be such a chaos), but it has its own private parking lot  that's a huge plus. Also free wifi too!!!!

The shop has a very cozy fell to it, and has about 10 small tables inside and outside. It also has its own roasting machine, I guess that's a big plus for HUGE coffee fan. Personally I like my coffee sweet and strong like cuban coffee. However, I made the mistake of ordering a Hazelnut cold brew. I mean don't get me wrong I still like it, but I prefer some sugar to it.

I came here to do a little research, since we haven't install internet at our place yet. After sitting there 3 hours, I decided to order a Chai iced latte and lemon poppy muffin. The latte is pretty good, but didn't stand out to me as a MUST have in my drink list.

I will definitely go back for the extremely friendly staff, and to try the cuban coffee in a colder weather."}
{"text":"Went this morning to meet up with some friends for coffee.

The place is relatively small which makes it difficult for groups but great for studying or getting some work done. That is if you can keep your attention off of the interesting characters passing through. 

If I want to escape my boring, finance job, jcrew lifestyle and hang out with shirtless Longboarders doing yoga and praying to rocks, this is definately my go to place."}
{"text":"Great cozy work spot, but very little in the way of food.  Just pastries and bagels."}
{"text":"I went to breakfast at Smelly Cat Coffee with my boyfriend and we really enjoyed ourselves. We ordered a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit and a bacon, egg and cheese burrito. The burritos and biscuits are homemade but premade; if you come later in the morning the options may be limited and you made need to ask them to reheat your meal. The biscuit itself was outrageously good. The burrito was not particularly special, although the bacon was cooked nicely.

The coffee menu is extensive and clearly well thought-out. There are hot and cold preparations, as well as pour-over options. You can sample the coffees which helps with decision-making. My white chocolate mocha left much to be desired; it tasted like raspberry for some reason. The mocha flavor is why I docked a star, since it is a coffee shop after all!

Smelly Cat Coffee ROCKS the interior. You walk in and feel immediately transported to the hippest part of Brooklyn (or should I say \"hipsterest\"?). The ceilings are covered in burlap sacks for coffee beans, nooks are formed with reclaimed wood (each has an outlet so that you can utilize their free Wi-Fi), a giant old-school coffee grinder provides an amazing focal point, and the walls are even faux exposed brick. There is a LOT going on but it all works together to provide a clever and cohesive ambience perfect for weekend relaxing, weekday (small) meetings, or even grabbing a quick cup to-go. There is a darling porch area with outdoor seating options. Smelly Cat Coffee is extremely animal friendly.

We will be returning to Smelly Cat Coffee to try some new items. It would be great for a long, yummy Saturday morning with a crossword puzzle."}
{"text":"A number of good coffee houses in CLT but Smelly Cat my fav. NODA parking always a challenge but goes with the turf."}
{"text":"The best almond milk latte that I've ever had in my life. Creamy and smooth. The ambience and staff were perfection. I would fly from Palm Springs just for this coffee again! Sad to not spend more time here! You will not regret your visit here!"}
{"text":"I used to spend many a day here during my first two years as new Charlotte resident but Sunday was my first time back in about a year. I can't remember what I used to order all those times but I am now a fan of their ever-popular iced dirty chai latte (with almond milk). Is it too far of a stretch for me to say that Smelly Cat is pretty close to being considered hipster-ish?  

In my experience, the employees are and always have been very knowledgeable and willing to break down any and all aspects of a drink. I've found that it's easier to ask about certain things than relying on the menu that's posted. Availability of some things change plus they're usually adding food items. On Sunday morning when I visited, they had scones, muffins, sausage/bacon & egg biscuits, and bagels - all made in-house. Maybe because it's the South, but I just don't see the need for a coffee shop to sell biscuit sandwiches. I skipped the food this time and happily sucked down my drink.

The dirty chai latte was/is delicious!!! The medium was $5.71 but I don't think it's that much more than what you would pay for the same drink at Starbucks. I loved that they prepared it with crushed ice and there was no need for any additional sweetener. The chai spice they use settles down at the bottom so be sure to give your drink a good shake before you take your first sip.

There are so many different drinks and coffee concoctions they that I look forward to continuing to drink my way around their menu!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place!!  The coffee is great!!  I had the iced toasted coconut latte!!  The flavor was great and it gave me the kick I needed!  The service was also very nice!  I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Won't bother with this place ever again. Over it. Asked for light ice because the first time I ordered an iced chai it was packed with ice and very little chai. Same BS. $4.75 cup of ice. Expensive."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much that I bought a sweatshirt! They have amazing cold brew and a great, cozy atmosphere! Around the building is a lot of neat street art that it necessary to check out. They're quick and their cold brew is amazing!"}
{"text":"Pretty good ! Rated 4 stars instead of 5 just because I reserve 5 stars for the absolute best places. I love their coconut iced lattes. They never get the whipped cream right. Parking is hit or miss. Really cute atmosphere in and outside."}
{"text":"I'm actually kind of heartbroken that I've lived in Charlotte for so long and never made it out here until today.  This place is awesome, it's the exact kind of coffee-haven that Charlotte needs more of, and it's situated in the cool streets of Noda.  The staff is helpful and engaging, the atmosphere is really conducive to quality conversations but also provides great space for someone who needs to plop down and grind out some work.  More importantly though - my drink was fantastic, and their in house bagels are phenomenal!  This place could definitely be my new go-to coffee place."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is an awesome NoDa hangout. The artsy decor includes doors that have been placed to create little nooks for several of the tables. 
They offer free wireless and plenty of coffee drinks and snacks. I typically get a chai latte, but if you're looking for more of a dessert, the chai shake is really good too. I love sitting outside reading a book and enjoying a coffee on a nice day."}
{"text":"No odorific felines here. Just solid coffee and a quaint, comfy coffee shop. Loved looking at the art that lined the beautiful, exposed brick walls.

They roast there own beans on a beautiful, red drum roaster right next to the counter. So you can get super freshly roasted beans to take home. 

Their prices are really good and their offerings diverse. I'm really looking forward to trying more of their menu... I might need a Cuban coffee soon!

Support local business. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is busy as all hell, and while it makes enjoying the place a bit of a pain sometimes, you should also take it as a sign that it is not to be missed.  I travel to CLT a fair amount, and Smelly Cat is the only place that is on my must stop list of coffee houses in the city."}
{"text":"Very good cup of joe. Love the atmosphere here and prices aren't bad. Not sure if they serve food but if so its probably delicious"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee, the breakfast burrito was great and the comfortable ambience was lovely! Lots of friendly dogs!"}
{"text":"One of the best lattes I've ever had!  I love everything from the fact that I could get almond milk to the smell of the roasting beans they prepare on sight. The coffee Roast was obviously a perfected art here!"}
{"text":"I am an out of town-er; we came to eat at the NOLA themed restaurant across the street and the waitress recommended this place for more variety of coffee. I had a hot chocolate with 2 shots of espresso. It was better than ANY mocha I've ever had! I love that they use ghiradelli chocolate for their drinks! If I lived in charlotte this would be a favorite for sure."}
{"text":"One of the coolest coffee places I've been to.  Love the repurposed doors for booths.  Great WiFi.  People talking and and playing games. The place makes you feel at ease and want to chat it up with the locals.  PLUS they use Square on their iPad for card processing... nerds will understand that one.  Oh, and the soy latte I had was great.  Oh, Oh, and the service was great everyone seemed to be happy to be there and work together.  *sigh* love"}
{"text":"After being contacted by the owner through Yelp, I had to up my rating. This is my local coffee shop, and I thought I loved it before, my biggest complaint being they do not serve breakfast sandwiches. 

Well not too long after writing my review the owner contacted me via message letting me know they have added B'fast wraps to the menu!! Stopped in to grab a bacon, egg & cheese and a Kona brew, and left a very happy camper. 

This is the difference between local business and corporations, GOOD local business listen to the needs/wants of their consumer and adapt. 

Kudos Smelly Cat, and thank you Cathy!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, fun atmosphere, and the staff were super friendly. We stopped here on our way to an event around the corner, and it was great. Their specialty is the dirty chai (chai tea w/1, 2, or 3 shots of espresso). We really liked it."}
{"text":"Great place .. Good strong coffee . Was told by the girl at the counter everything g is made here -- even the coffee beans are roasted on the premises."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this famous NoDa neighborhood coffee shop. Following most Yelper's recommendation, I tried the hot 'dirty chai' and definitely enjoyed it, although it didn't leave me jumping for joy. It came in a really small cup, maybe 10 ounces ( which is okay with me) Maybe I should try it iced? Not sure. 

The restaurant itself is a unique, quirky , funky type of place that would like to park myself in to read a book, do some homework, or write some Yelp reviews.  It's very narrow inside, but they got creative with the seating: single person alcoves along the wall, bar seating at the front window, seating outside in the front, and on the sides of the building. There is even a curvy bar from which I believe at some point in the day they serve beer on tap ( local brewery creations included). 

Saturday morning was pretty crowded inside, but I will certainly be making a trip back, maybe when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat has become my de facto office this semester since I can't seem to find anybody to give me a real one. I'm in Smelly Cat right now...I love it here.

The staff is friendly, and the decor is fun. I love the doors. I wish there were a few more plugs for the laptops, and a few more food offerings would be nice...but I can handle these little defects. The coffee is good, and you can sit here for hours without anyone bothering you."}
{"text":"being a professional coffeesnob.  This made me happy.  Great service, the best cap in Charlotte, and a great place to hang out.  I went to all the coffeehouses in Charlotte this won!!"}
{"text":"Top notch coffee and fantastic baristas! They roast all their own coffee in-house and do a great job. I thought decaf and cold brew coffee were both sacrilege, until I tried the Peruvian (get it as a pour over, Leah knows her shit!), Snickerdoodle, and Hazelnut. Also, just try a pour over with any of the roasts, it'll open your eyes to a whole new level of coffee goodness!"}
{"text":"I didn't watch Friends so the reference was lost on me, but damn was that an amazing dirty chai! The entire shop was cool and I recommend it. I really like NoDa."}
{"text":"The best part of this place is the decor. Their coffee, I've heard (from coffee loving friends) that it was not good. But personally I'm a Chai tea lover, and their chai tea is very very bad. It's powder based and very bad. But it has a cool vibe, I'd probably go for a tea (can't go wrong with hot water and a tea bag)."}
{"text":"Hands down Charlotte's best dirty chai. Good vibes in here! One of my most fav places to get coffee here in the Queen City, located right in rad noda. Grab a coffee - chill inside, or go walk around and get weird."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is a decent coffee shop. The main thing it has going for it is the ambiance, it is a very nice spot. The coffee is good, nothing to rave about. I would give Smelly Cat a better review if they had a better food selection, though their muffins are my favorite it isnt enough."}
{"text":"We love the Smelly Cat! The antique rustic atmosphere is very hip and the employees are extremely helpful. We tried there version of a frap and loved it. Once weekly we drive forty five minutes to the cat house and find it very relaxing."}
{"text":"This is one of the best coffee shops in Charlotte! I have been going to Smelly Cat since 2012, and I keep going back there at least once a week. The baristas are always friendly and they have a great sense of humor, the atmosphere is great, it is beautifully decorated, and the coffee is amazing!"}
{"text":"I went here with my aunt who I am visiting. She had been raving about it for a while. I was pleasantly surprised by the cute decoration on the outside and all the outdoor seating. It was around dusk when we went so all the outdoor lights were on as well which added to the ambiance. 

The inside did not disappoint either. It had the neatest seating made from reused doors as well as regular tables. It was very cozy and private. 

The menu was diverse and they had a few little food items wrapped up for sale. I had a regular coffee and my aunt had a orange creamsicle milkshake. Both were very good. 

The service was efficient and fast. It was quiet and a great place to enjoy a book. I enjoyed this local little coffee shop and will for sure come back. A great little place to check out in NoDa!"}
{"text":"Extremely cool, hip spot in an eclectic neighborhood. Grab your coffee and delicious pastry and walk the streets to people watch it view some cool murals. The coffee is delicious with house made syrups and of course, the baristas are knowledgeable and accommodating."}
{"text":"I ordered a Dirty Chai here and my life has never been the same since. When I sip on my daily, straight forward and unimaginative iced coffee, distant memories of espresso, chai, almond milk and crushed ice still dance in my mind. 

The truth is, I came here for the name. And because it was literally across the street from Yelp's Summertime Soiree at the Neighborhood Theatre across the street.

But boy am I glad they came up with a quirky name to hook and line me in there to experience that Dirty and take in the sights and scents of roasting coffee."}
{"text":"Cute coffee house with good coffee. All drinks served in to go cups. I'm kind of picky but like my drink in glassware when I go out to places like this for coffee."}
{"text":"A nice little hangout if it's a nice day and you just want to chill and have a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat brings me joy.

Their coffee has never let me down. Hot fresh, roasty, toasty, creamy latte goodness.

Cute like a baby whose cheeks you want you squeeze.

Friendly like Labrador who wants to be petted behind his ears (sorry Kitty).

Perfectly located like a nose on your face (and in my favorite neighborhood).

A welcome beacon - a lighthouse that guides me to a caffeinated night cap before my journey home.

Gracias, mi amigo, Smelly Cat."}
{"text":"Smeelllly cat, Smeeelllly cat, whaat aaare theey feeeeding yoou?  - in my Phoebe voice.  

I always have the 'Smelly  Cat' song stuck in my head when I grab a cup of coffee here before breaking out my laptop to get some work done at this cozy shop. It's a good thing 'cause this place always perks me up.


Now, I'm going to spill the beans:

Pleasant pour-overs
Freshly roasted coffeee
Tip top tea (I like mine Green, aren't you envious ;-)
Exellent Espressos (try the new Con-Panna)
No bake brownie (nuff said)
Friendly baristas
Free Wi-Fi.

Plus, you gotta try the place out because it's a NoDa staple."}
{"text":"Unique. The decorations of cats inside the place really pay tribute to the name. The baristas were all very friendly and warm. It's a bit dark and small inside but they provide great seating outside if that isn't your scene. 
They gave me quick service and my cubano was delicious. 
The area is very cute with several other places to walk around and shop. 
They also had wonderful baked goods for sale 

They have a good amount of seating :-)"}
{"text":"My Experience: Lucky I guess reading other reviews, but I drive right up to a parking space beside the building. However, I can see there could be a problem in parking. Especially, if you are not familiar with this area like me. 

This coffee shop is small with inside seating as well as outside seating. It's completely comfortable once you find a seat inside. Outside Seating looks like it would be the place to sit at if the weather is nice and not hot like is right now on this late June day.

They do have WiFi but the password must be given to you at time of checkout. The password is something weird. The cashier wrote it down on a piece of napkin but I couldn't read her hand writing. So I took my IPhone 7 to her and she typed it in for me. She also did my MacBook Air. So, that's great customer service.

How Discovered:  I found this place because I use the Yelp App. I hit directions to take me here but it was wanting me to use a path that included a road closed. I believe it was 36th Street. So, I redirected my Yelp GPS and I finally got here on a Sunday morning just before noon. 

Menu item ordered:  I studied the Yelp listing, reviews and photos taken and decided on the toasted coconut frappe with whip cream. It's a cold sweet drink with caffeine that is perfect for this time of year in early Summer.  It was delicious and was so good that it was gone within a few minutes.

Final Thoughts: I really like this coffee shop. Yes, I would come back if in area. A lot of college age students were at this coffee shop while I was here.  Now, there are several colleges and Universities close by and it looks like when the students visit this business when they are not in class. Also, when looking outside down the street the visit other local establishments close by too."}
{"text":"If I'm ever having a bad day, I always make a point to come over to Smelly Cat for an iced soy dirty chai latte. The baristas are always happy and make a point to ensure your experience from the time you enter the shop to the time you leave with your coffee is positive. The chai is not a syrup like some of the independent coffee shops in Charlotte and is made to order. They also have yummy biscuit sandwiches and breakfast burritos if you can get there early enough. Lots of seating inside and out and a great location if you just want to take your coffee to go and walk around NoDa. Even though they sell something as simple as coffee, their passion and amount of care they put in to their drinks really does make a difference. Smelly Cat is one of the examples I give when people ask what I love about living in Charlotte."}
{"text":"If you like the ambience of a coffee shop than you will like this place.  The only minus is it very small so you won't be able to sit.  They roast their own coffee which in general is a plus for a shop. I had a white chocolate mocha and my girlfriend had a dirty chai latte both had great flavor. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves coffee it is worth your time! They also have stand up comedy which is cool but again it very had have 15 people in the place since it is so small."}
{"text":"I walked in after work and was quickly soothed by Bob Marley tunes and a fresh Ethiopian Coffee.  There is reading material all around, which is definitely a must have.  The joint looks like a brick storage unit that was painted by a bunch of hippies and decorated by cat lovers.  There are comfy seats throughout and booths if you arrived with friends.  

They change their coffee specials daily and they range from Decaf to Dark, and they are all delicious.  I heard the Mango Smoothies are a delicious treat as well.  I gotta try one next time around.  

I also thought that the outside seating was well decorated with homemade wind chimes and trees for shade during those hot Charlotte afternoons.  I liked it so much that I should have left a tip at the bar, but I was a little broke.  Woops."}
{"text":"Best coffee  I have had , cute place, nice hard working staff, definitely will be going here often."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Smelly Cat!  I generally get an iced white mocha.  My favorite thing to get there is the Cheddar and Chive Scone.  It is delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the White Mocha and it was delicious. Love the atmosphere.I love that it the place has the same name as phoebes smelly cat song. The inside is so cool. To me it looks Friends inspired. I loved it."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a great cup of Joe!"}
{"text":"The owners were just as warm and welcoming as their coffee  I enjoy a nice almond milk latte and they were able to accommodate my desire. They make their flavored syrups in house, and boy were they a treat! I had the maple brown sugar as did my friend. She considered it to be the best coffee she'd ever tasted! The space was quaint and cozy, a great place to wake up and start the day! Overall, this was the perfect coffee house for our Charlotte visit."}
{"text":"Cute as a button tucked into the pocket of the heart of NoDa, and full of the quirky but laissez-fare vibe that makes the neighborhood so special.  I mean, where else can you come in for espresso and sit next to a neighbor's dog curled against a booth and lazily awaiting its owner's return?  Where else can you have chocolate truffles and coffee (a combination that needs to proliferate, in my humble view)?

Look, this little nook of a shop makes a good brew and has plenty of tempting eats to nosh on.  If you want to step away from the big chains and get to know your local shops and the neighbors, the Cat fits that bill.  Baristas know the regulars and if you will just talk to them, they will make your drink to fit your preferences too.  If it's not, tell them and they'll remake it.  

The wife and I like coming here if for no other reason than each trip is an experience- interesting people, interesting sights, and it feels like we find something new to try every time.  I recommend it to anyone who visits and encourage locals to go and support a local business doing it all right.

Like their Facebook page for notices of upcoming events and special products (not to mention a list of that days fresh brews)."}
{"text":"Small coffee shop but cute. I don't enjoy being in here when it's really busy. Just not enough room to move around. They make a mean London Fog everytime I order it!!"}
{"text":"In the midst of Charlotte's lackluster coffee scene, Smelly Cat stands out as one of the best. Their iced coffee is delicious, and the setting is always a great place to work. I've written many a college paper there."}
{"text":"Posting for a friend (because I'm a Smelly Cat fan and want to support these guys!) \"I had not gone into Smelly Cat for over a year because I experienced extremely rude customer service. Despite my past experience, I decided to give Smelly Cat another try. Last Sunday, I went in and the staff was extremely personable! Best customer service since Leah left! I will gladly continue to enjoy this place in the future!\""}
{"text":"Very cool !  Awesome little coffee shop in Charlotte North Carolina. Great coffee, cool relaxed atmosphere, you can even sit and get some work done if you want. The coffee is stellar ( try the Ethiopian ). Theme he has lots of great lite selections to grab and go if you need to. A must stop for coffee lovers when in Charlotte NC."}
{"text":"This place is still amazing. I am writing this as an update. I have been coming here for almost 3 years and it still never gets old. I just wanted to mention the new roaster. They roast their own COFFEE!!!!!!!!! This is such an amazing thing for a small coffee shop to have. It is such a creative niche. The quality of their coffee is the best in Charlotte. HAND DOWN!!!!. 

My favorite still is the dirty chai. 

I would like to mention something weird about this place which makes it very special. I applied to work here right before the DNC, and I got past the first interview. They told me that I would have to sign a contract that I would be able to work for at least a year in order to get the job. Due to being a college student, I couldn't get tied down for a year, but I love that they want their employees to stay for at least a year so that they gain a bond with the customers. I would love to work for a company/business like this in the future. 

There is also talk about getting their own bakery area. They are going to make all their baked goods in house. This place is going to be around for a long time."}
{"text":"Not enough stars! This is what you envision when your looking for a cool place to sit and enjoy a coffee. Although I love coffee, my first visit here I had a green tea because I also love green tea and I was already amping out on caffine....  I'm looking forward to my next visit  and have a cup of joe, as I'm confident that it will be as good as the tea. This area of Charlotte known as NoDa reminds me of South Street in Philly. Very cool/ seemingly nice people everywhere just doing their thing. This place is right in the epicenter. Came in feeling pretty shitty and left in a much better state of mind. Good music in the air, mellow lighting, nice muffins and other pastries and Strong wifi. I opened up my devices but found myself just enjoying the ambiance of this place and shut everything down and just chilled with my eyes closed for a while. I may become a regular. If your in NoDa check this place out. Btw...  unlike starbucks, you can order a SMALL- MEDIUM OR LARGE!"}
{"text":"The. SWEETEST. STAFF. EVER.  These guys have all the right ingredients for creating a great coffee, business, and experience.  My hats off and wallet open to this business."}
{"text":"Pretty good, nice and quiet place. A bit small and crowded but it adds to the ambience and aesthetics if that's your sort of thing. The coffee is decent, some are better than others. It's not a Starbucks type of thing. Strong black coffee and maybe some fancy mixed coffees here and there."}
{"text":"Beautiful Sunday morning, artsy little cafe, sun shining, hot sweet chai, people enjoying the day inside and out. The door partitions between booths are just as cool as other reviewers said. I look forward to trying other beverages and hanging out..."}
{"text":"Beware of HIDDEN FEES!!! If you like to get the Cuban coffee they are charging you an extra $1.50 for sugar but they never tell you or have it posted on the menu. I have looked over my orders for the past 3 months and it's ridiculous all the hidden fees/charges. Also, the girl who took my order yesterday made a mistake when she gave me my order (I order cold brew, she gave me hot coffee) and then she charged me extra $2 to correct it, any other coffee shop would have corrected it for free since it was their mistake. I'm all about helping small business but they shouldn't take advantage of us."}
{"text":"If I have to spend some time in NODA, drink coffee, watch people, and work on my stuff on the internet/laptop, then this is the place.

NODA got some characteristics and this place completes the NODA neighborhood. The outside seating is not great if it's cold but in the warm weathers it's the best to sit outside, as long as the sun is not shining directly on you. Inside, the chairs and sofa chairs are comfortable. Few tables are setup in such a way that it feels like an intimate setup. 

Main thing - the coffee is great. The barristas are friendly and helpful with any tips regarding coffee.

I am a big coffee drinker. If I am in NODA and have time for coffee then I know where to go."}
{"text":"After living in Charlotte for over 10 years, I finally had coffee at Smelly Cat. Based on that one experience, I'd say 5 stars. The drip coffee was good, the cheddar and chive scone was good, the service was good. All in a all a good coffee shop experience. It's not super convenient to me and there's about 8,000 coffee shops between my house and this location. But if you're in the area, or just curious to check it out, go for it!"}
{"text":"I am not a coffee person, so if you're looking for a review about that, move on. I'm just here to say as a water drinker, this space is ok. The parking lot is small, so street parking is almost mandatory. The space inside is a bit cramped, but eclectic and fun. The menu does have some non coffee stuff, but the pricing? Ouch! I love the idea of you, but I'm never going to be a Smell Cat person..... ps: dogs are better! :D"}
{"text":"One of my fav coffee places in Charlotte. You can smell the aroma right from their parking lot. 
We ordered a cortado and cappuccino...good mix of coffee and music ... loved the ambience and the currency wall...found a note from my country :p
Will definitely come again when in Noda"}
{"text":"What a cool place to have a good cup of coffee! Loved it so much I bought a shirt!! It's small but a must try if you like cool coffee spots."}
{"text":"Funky little place. Been driving by here for ever and always wanted to stop. Friendly staff, typical coffeehouse menu. Got the toasted coconut frappé. YUMMO!! I'll have to stop in more often."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Charlotte! Best mocha frapp I've ever had. Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Facts:
- Phoebe Buffay does NOT work here! 
- Charming and cozy coffee house.
- Offers pour over, cold brews, specialty espresso beverages, or caramel apple ciders.
- Selection of breakfast bites, pastries, and fresh bagels.
- Indoor and outdoor seatings.

Great spot.
Four and Half Yelps."}
{"text":"No Da at its best.  Small place, big prescences in the No Da hood.  Indoor and out door seating, plenty to eat and drink.

Parking can be a challenge, but when you want to get away from the Restaurant and bar scene in this part of town, Smelly is the way to go.

Be it coffee or tea, ice cream, or pastries, they have a little something for everyone.

During warmer months they also live music outside.  Throw in a Friday gallery art crawl and it is both a nice place to start and finish such an evening."}
{"text":"It was good experience .  It was something new and favorable , I am not a big fan of coffee or tea but it's a good spot if you enjoy that . The best part is the interior and atmosphere . I liked it ."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this little coffee shop in the Noda district of Charlotte. The space is a little tight but theres a great atmosphere here to make up for it and provide such a cozy coffee shop vibe! Outside seeing is available with some quirky art painted on the side of the building and some cute lights strung above the table area. Inside is set up with recycled materials and seemed like a nice place to set up a lap top and sit down and do work, but the weather was way to nice to not enjoy the outdoors and watch people walking to and from the farmers market.
Their customer service was great too! If you seem quizzical in trying to make up your mind on what to order they are all there to help you decide! I ordered an iced hazelnut latte but was sad when i found out they don't carry hazelnut and the woman helped me find an even better flavor; toasted coconut! it was delicious and well made and kept me going all day! I am so happy that Noda had this little oasis to stop by that was a good break from brewery tours and pizza shops!"}
{"text":"Smelly Cat Coffee House is everything I love about local coffee place.  They have a relaxing vibe, a cozy, eclectic space, friendly staff, and some darn good coffee drinks.

I have ventured to this place a couple of times now.  I had a coffee drink the first time and a chai the second time.  Their coffee good; smooth, not bitter at all.  The chai was great as well.  Where some coffee places make their drinks too hot, both times my drinks were at the perfect temperature for immediate consumption.  I also had one of their big cranberry orange muffins, which was moist and not tart at all.  

The space is cozy, with a few tables around.  It has a rustic, artistic feel to it.  The staff has been friendly, always striking up conversation.  It feels very inviting here.

I only wish I lived a little closer."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is such a cool, cute coffee shop. The \"smack your mama\" cake is delish and the tea selection, while a little high priced, is wide. I came here with my mom and a friend and even though there were 3 of us, we had to sit in the little booths made of recycled wooden doors, hung with local art. Magic!"}
{"text":"Smelly Cat Coffee is cute, laid back, and open late! We love stopping in for a cappuccino and walking NoDa at night. The staff is friendly, and the coffee/espresso tastes great!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop by far. I love walking a few blocks to this cool atmosphere. Always friendly staff and the coffee hasn't been bad yet. Very fresh and satisfying. Have tried almost everything on their menu and have been impressed with the quality. Great prices and with the best coffee drinkers to hang out around."}
{"text":"Located in the NoDa (North of Davidson) district of Charlotte, NoDa began its rebirth in the 80's after the areas last mill closed in 1975. Artists with a vision of creating a new fringe arts district are off to a good start, opening several shops and restaurants bordering 36th Street and North Davidson. Among those businesses is Smelly Cat, a locally owned coffee shop that aside from coffee, serves sandwiches and other snack items including a uber yummy peanut butter pie. 

Small booths are constructed of used doors and the overall decor is rustic with a sprinkling of cat items throughout, there is outdoor seating as well as a small parking lot to the side of the building.

While NoDa is a bit out of the way, it is one of the more interesting neighborhoods in Charlotte and Smelly Cat is a fun addition to this district.  The first and third Friday of each month brings out the free \"Gallery Crawl\", where the galleries stay open late in the evening."}
{"text":"Trendy little shop with great coffee and awesome atmosphere.  I'm a big fan of the iced llorona on tap however, sometimes there are out but I can easily find a replacement cup of Joe."}
{"text":"Every time I come in here, the girls are so sweet and cheery in a genuinely welcoming way. I feel like a friend to them, and man is that nice. Their drinks are really lovely. My favourite beans are light roasts, which they don't really favor, but even still their coffee and lattes are pretty good. Coffee never tastes burnt (which is rare in this industry). They take pride in roasting their own beans and do a solid job of it. The atmosphere is homey and rustic. That is what I love. Well crafted coffee and a homey setting that screams \"oh come, ye masses of chaotic lives, come and sit and just be.\""}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I moved to Charlotte 3 1/2 years ago from Illinois. I don't know why it's taken me 3 1/2 years to find a wonderful coffee shop but HOT DAMN I found one! My coworker and I got frape's today - I got a coconut frape and she got a peanut butter frape. My life is changed. I have seen the coffee heavens with my own eyes through this coffee. Thank you to whomever opened this store and thank you for making delicious coffee. I am so happy I can now support a local coffee business instead of being disappointed at the big-box coffee shops. Thanks again - I'll be a regular customer any time I'm in NoDa."}
{"text":"Tasty French Roast coffee? Super cool and friendly staff (this time)? AND not many hipsters clogging up the inside? Man oh man this is WAY more my speed.

I sat in a corner sipping my coffee (and guiltily chowing down on a cranberry muffin) and retaking in the place. Sure, the walls still had ears (and some overpriced artwork), but I actually could sit and think and write. Then about 30 minutes later, one of my friends dropped in and some of the stories she was telling I could tell the MacBook guy was listening quite intently.

While sitting in there, I heard The Decemberists, Temper Trap, and a bunch of other Leanne-approved alternative bands. Definitely an improvement of last time too.

Thank you Smelly Cat for a pleasant experience, I'll be back!

(oh yeah, and Props for the Yelp sign at the counter AND the one on the door!)"}
{"text":"It's so difficult to find places that allow my baby Paris (maltipoo dog) in that serves fresh and tasty goodies. Exploring Charlotte I came across this cute spot and from the name I figured they would have no problem letting him in. 
Cute outside seating, cozy rustic inside, and the customer service was top notch. Visited on a Sunday and it wasn't crazy busy but there were about 4 tables filled inside, while only 1 table, besides mine was taken outside. Ordered the iced Mojito Green Tea, and got too excited when I saw a gluten free peanut butter bar! Yesssss and it was OH SO DELICIOUS! Definitely the perfect spot for relaxing, getting work done, reading a book. This is not a place for a massive study group but stop in being 3 friends and order that peanut butter bar! I could've shared mine.... But naa =)"}
{"text":"Made a quick stop into Smelly Cat Coffee on Monday afternoon. I went with a Toasted Coconut Frappe.

Quality
Smelly Cat Coffee was a necessary last stop before leaving Charlotte. Desperate for a boost of energy, we decided coffee was the answer. Feeling adventurous, I decided to go with a more elaborate Toasted Coconut Frappe. And while I did enjoy the milkshake-like coffee drink, it quickly became too much sweetness for me. Good in a small dose, but definitely something to share. I think I would have opted for a more traditional selection if given another chance. 

Quantity
My Frappe was very large and maybe a little too much for one person. I ended up handing it off to my girlfriend about two-thirds through.

Value
My drink was about $5, which seemed like a decent deal for a specializeed drink.

Ambiance
Smelly Cat Coffee is located in the NoDa area of Charlotte. In an area full of live music venues, old school theaters, and rows of little shops and restaurants, the coffee house fits right in. Outside they have plenty of tables and chairs set up to enjoy a beautiful day. Unfortunately the weather was not behaving and with little shelter outside was not an option. So, we ended up inside, which at first felt cramped, but after a short rush, felt more cozy. In terms of decor the shop is busy, with things everywhere, mostly related to coffee. They had a bar near the front, several tables in the center space, and then a few uniquely crafted enclosed tables on each wall. The larger back area was reserved for making and serving coffee. The building felt like it had history in its bones, and while that adds charm, it was frustrating dealing with wall sockets that could not keep a charge and tables that were a little too rickety. In the background alternative rock music crooned over the speakers, which I also believed could use an upgrade.

Crowd
The place was busy on Monday afternoon, granted it was a holiday and I'm sure folks needed coffee to get going after a night out. The crowd seemed mixed between folks who had settled in with books, newspapers, and computers, and groups just grabbing coffee to go. It was a younger crowd and I got a very hipster vibe.

Service
The girls behind the counter were friendly and quick with drink preparation. Even during a rush, they seemed to have no issue in pushing out drinks fast.

Parking
The coffee shop is located in a small town center. And despite some construction going on, plenty of street spots were available.

Extra
Smelly Cat Coffee got the job done while searching for a pick me up in the NoDa area of Charlotte. And had the weather had been better, I believe I would have very much enjoyed sitting outside and sipping on my cool beverage. A place that probably needs more visits for a more complete analysis, but one with plenty of charm and solid coffee."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is my new jam. Many reasons behind this, but number one amongst them is THEY ROAST THEIR OWN COFFEE. I haven't non-single brew coffee this good since SoCal. And believe me, freshly roasted coffee is seriously good. Earthier, smoother, more flavorful.

But the coffee is not the only reason you should visit Smelly Cat. They carry first-rate snacks from premium local bakers, including some incredible gluten free options. I sprang for the gluten free peanut butter brownie and OMFG was it good.

There's also an awesome patio area in the front where you can hipster-watch in NoDa. Those hilarious hipsters, always up to some sort of hullabaloo or haberdashery.

You should go to Smelly Cat for all of these reasons. I look forward to exploring their shop again."}
{"text":"Always have great service and choices for new coffees. Cool vibe. Love this neighborhood stop for a good cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I love this place, their frappes and coffee are so good!

Also, the location is right in the middle of NoDa & they have nice outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever tasted! Being able to watch them roast the beans right in front of me was pretty cool as well."}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee shop in Charlotte, and one of my favorites anywhere. Staff is incredibly nice and welcoming, atmosphere is fabulous, and it's in a really cool part of town. There's a nice variety of brews offered each day, and I've never had a bad cup. They roast their own coffee which is always a plus, not to mention a decent selection of pastries, beer, and wine. I'm not in Charlotte very often anymore, but whenever I'm there I try to stop by."}
{"text":"Good coffee, but great location and atmosphere. A must in NoDa"}
{"text":"The coffee is unique, that's for sure. I visited here from the airport due to a caffeine headache, and sipped at my coffee as I traveled the two hours to Asheville. While I was there I tried other coffee shops, but I really missed the stuff I got here. On my way to the airport I stopped by here to grab another coffee and a bag of their beans. They have a giant in house roaster, so I got beans that were freshly roasted that day! They also support the local businesses in the area, so I'm a fan. The workers weren't exactly friendly, but for the good coffee it's worth it."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat features free wifi and friendly service. One of my favorite spots for an afternoon coffee and a laid back atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Overall, I think supporting local business is among my top priorities. Which is why I continue to get coffee here when I can. Plus I really like the owners and their approach to being innovative in their business. But overall, it's not my favorite - the value of what you're getting compared to the cost always seems to be out of whack. The smell of the beans roasting is an instant no for me - I love the smell of coffee roasting, but this doesn't smell like coffee. Worst offense for me, though, is the parking situation - I will never understand how all the spaces are full, but no one is actually in the place. If I can't find parking, I usually just drive somewhere else."}
{"text":"I rarely drink coffee, usually when I'm making a long distance drive.

But I've had tea several times at the Smelly Cat. Not bad. Nice too that they gave me more hot water when I was done and I was able to use my tea bag for another cup.

The dessert was good as well as the sliced sandwich wraps.

The cons:

I once visited on a day that someone's child was allowed free reign. Like, I saw him playing in the seating area then running behind the counter TOUCHING things, no hand washing apparent. 

Um, no.

On my last visit -- which was my LAST visit -- there was a dog in the shop. Animals are lovely just not in a place where I'm paying to eat.

As a former pet owner, I know that even when animals are banned from the kitchen, animal FUR can never be banned from anywhere animals are allowed.

The hair floats on the smallest of breezes and deposits itself where ever it happens to land..."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Charlotte and I have been looking for a local coffee shop with a homey and relaxing feel. Smelly cat is exactly that! It has a cool outside seating area to hang out with friends, a nice inside area to hang as well. I'm really liking the decor too. I wish there was a little more seating inside though. Really friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee shop with delicious coffee and treats. Very cozy vibe and friendly staff. They have breakfast sandwiches now too."}
{"text":"Entered Smelly Cat for the second time in my life the other day (first visit was a group meeting back when I was getting my MBA, and I'm trying to block that craziness from my mind, so this review is only for my most recent visit). 

What a wonderful little coffee shop. If I lived in NoDa, I would definitely support this small business instead of hitting up the big chains. The atmosphere is quite cool and laid back, and the staff was beyond wonderful. They had a ton of pastries and what looked like a mouth watering carrot cake, but I was there for one reason, and one reason only...caffeine.

Nicole W (being the fantastic community manager that she is) raved to me about the pour over coffee, so at Yelp's Passport to NoDa event earlier this week, I hightailed it over there to check it out. The wonderful Cathy (what a great name, huh?) walked us through the process of pour over coffee, which creates a very smooth cup o' joe. I thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and my caffeine - with some steamed almond milk and honey. Very, very good. If you have the time to wait, I highly recommend checking it out. 

And to support the business even further, I purchased a nice little pullover. There are t-shirts, sweatshirts, and other items for sale with the logo and location on them. I love me some quirky little gear. 

Head on in to Smelly Cat and sit inside if the weather isn't good, or grab one of the outdoor tables and soak up some vitamin D. Either way, you can feel good about supporting a small business in your area."}
{"text":"Short and sweet (okay not really but I'm a thorough person I guess). Point by point, at least:

+ Girl at register was unpleasant and aloof, but in a particularly unusual and rude way, not just in the stereotypical \"aloof coffeeshop employee\" way. I felt like I was actively burdening her with my presence even as I stood there quietly and patiently waiting for her to be ready to take my order. One star off. If I lived nearby, that interaction alone would put me off returning regularly. Not a good sign. 

+ Fella who handed me my drink? Pleasant and cheerful. Plus one. 

+ Iced dirty chai? Awesome! I love the crushed ice and weird spice thing (I can't totally describe it but it's like what would happen if someone crumbled a ginger/molasses-flavored Oreo wafer in the bottom of the cup) going on in it. Kind of wish there was a little more ice to cool it a bit longer, but that's not a true complaint because I'm a slow drinker. Plus two stars. 

+ As I was sitting outside minding my own business in this glorious weather (I live in Durham, decided to visit Charlotte on a whim) while texting my brother in Colorado, a member of a ministry student group(?) who was meeting outside decided to come up to me and try to \"share something\" with me. As a devout atheist, I actively discouraged him and he went away pretty quickly, but it was very unpleasant. After that interchange I left the warm sunny bench I was sitting on to retreat to my car. Minus half a star because I know this isn't the business's issue, but soliciting/proselytizing at customers should be actively discouraged. Not sure if this is a regular weekend meeting place for the group of fellows or if it was simply happenstance on this particular day.

+ Parking is confusing as fuck. I'm not familiar with Charlotte \"this side of sign\" parking and gave up on their terrifying(!) parking lot immediately and parked down the street. The weather was nice enough that I was fine with walking farther, but in crummier weather, I can't see doing it. Half a star off. 

Three stars. The drink was great, the ambiance less so. I will admit 100% that I went here based on name alone (and the picture of a drink with crushed iced, I guess)."}
{"text":"Cute cafe with great selection of drinks. Could use more indoor seating but it has a great vibe for talking or studying. I wouldn't come here with more than one person at a time, but you can def enjoy a couple hours here easily."}
{"text":"Neat decor, cool booth ish places and pretty solid coffee. I didn't watch friends so I don't really get the name but i like it anyways."}
{"text":"Love the cat! The coffee is tasty, good variety of pastries, and the baristas are friendly.

In the summer I recommend the iced coffee. You can have plain or flavored iced coffee and the ice is slushy (like Sonic or Chickfila) so it's a nice surprise if you're used to the cubes at Starbucks or Dunkin.

Definitely sign up for a VIP account if you'll be stopping here often or you're social media savvy. Smelly Cat rewards it's VIPs with special treats (check Facebook or Twitter for postings) and with each purchase you earn other rewards like free coffees. I really love a place that loves it's customers like Smelly Cat does."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very relaxed, and the baristas are very friendly! The shop is small and a little cramped but they have seating outside as well."}
{"text":"I was exploring the NODA area and came across this coffee shop on Yelp. The name stuck out as it reminded me of the show Friends so I decided to check it out. It's a quaint coffee shop that was conveniently located next to a small farmer's market. They offer three size options for hot coffee beverages - starting at 8 ounces. I ordered the Dirty Chai with almond milk. It is the best Dirty Chai I've had to date. The espresso didn't taste burnt and mixed well with the chai mix used. They also have a rewards program which is nice. I believe I was auto-enrolled when I swiped my credit card. If I am ever back in the area, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. I get tea lattes and it blows my mind how unfamiliar some coffee places are with these. Anyway, I ordered, super nice people and all, but the tea latte wasn't that great. It was like warm when I got it which I don't know how since I got it straight away, and there was like, zero foam. What's a latte without foam? They also don't have stevia or my lesser choice, Splenda. My husband got the vanilla cappuccino. It was good, but very sweet. You know, sometimes you get a cappuccino more espresso tasting, and others more sweet? Well this one was the latter. The hubby was also treated to their fruity pebbles marshmallow treat. I'm not a fan of rice crispy treats, but I am a fan of fruity pebbles! This was a chunk of sugar rush that did not let me down! As the name suggests, there is something dying in there. It smells bad of you get the whiff. I don't like it. It's a cool, funky spot though to hang out and you can't be in there without thinking about Friends."}
{"text":"Good coffee and they have BEER! This place is unique; it has a very artsy vibe.

Generally much better coffee than Starbucks, Caribou and Dilworth coffee."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee and espresso, great staff and very down to earth. Barista's are friendly and have a passion for their art but are not egotistical which is rare. Wish there was more lighting and better seating but over all wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I love Smelly Cat.  They are not only a coffee shop but a roaster as well.  If you can catch them on a roasting day, the smell is fabulous!  Kathy, the owner, is super friendly as is the rest of the staff and the coffee and pastries do not disappoint.  It's conveniently located in NoDa on the corner of N. Davidson and 36th.  If you're catching lunch at Boudreaux's or grabbing some beer at Salud, follow up with a locally roasted (usually organic) cup-a-joe at Smelly Cat.

Oh, and despite the name, there are no smelly cats anywhere to be seen.  This isn't a cat cafe.  Yes, those exist."}
{"text":"I am SO shocked to know I haven't reviewed this place yet. I probably go here most out of any other coffee shop! And always for their chai. Their chai is so good, it beats Amelie's chai's butt. As does their hot chocolate, yum! They used to carry really yummy Italian sodas and ice creams but stopped it. 
The highlight of this place is their outdoor seating on a beautiful day, but even the inside is cute and cozy. My favorite thing to do on a weekend morning is to get a cup of chai at Smelly and walk down N. Davidson looking at the quaint little shops. 
However nothing beats hanging out here on Friday and Saturday nights until 12am during warmer months."}
{"text":"The latte! Just wow. I'm in love with their homemade syrups! I mean the latte was FULL of flavor!! I'd didn't have to add ANYTHING! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Yummy double shot mocha! Friendly staff in hipster section of town.........glad I found this place. I heart this place and would hang out here more often if I lived in NC!"}
{"text":"though i buy starbucks alot, i love these non-chain cute coffee-shops! decent selection of beverages.  i've only tried the iced mocha and it was good.  Wish I was in town a little longer so i could sit in the cafe and get some work done!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, great service, underrated loyalty program. Very convenient. 

Only negative, once saw the owner (manager?) yell at the staff in front of all the customers. Lots of turnover, but the staff is very good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this quaint coffee shop. I've come here multiple times to work on papers for school and every staff member has been so friendly towards me. I asked if they would pour single glasses of wine and they gladly gave me a generous pour of some delicious red wine. I told them I was working on a big final paper and they asked me how I was doing with genuine curiosity. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm fully in support of independent coffee shops. I won't lie: I love Starbucks for its consistency and quality drinks. But sometimes you just need to leave the corporate behind and support local businesses. 

I wanted to love Smelly Cat--I really did. (Come on, what's not to love about the name?) And from all the good reviews, I had high expectations. I don't at all consider myself a snob, but it just wasn't my scene. Rustic is nice, but Smelly Cat could have stepped up the decor just a tad. 

The coffee house reminded me of a dive bar. That's not a terrible thing though, right? So, my impression was that I'd at least get a reasonably priced drink. However, I was taken back to find out that a small flavored iced latte would cost me $5.  Whoa...I didn't realize that ice cubes were that hot of a commodity in Charlotte. So I immediately backtracked my order and went with a frappe instead. It tasted alright, though it was on the rich side.

I will give Smelly Cat a thumbs up though for its indoor and outdoor seating. There's definitely plenty of space to chill out and enjoy your food and beverages. Oh, and did I mention they sell beer? I didn't try it, but kudos for that."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat thanks for providing me with a comfy booth and tasty treats. And yes, I'm that tool who sings the Smelly Cat song in my head every single time I walk into this cute little coffee house. 

Smelly Cat is one of those adorable local coffee hangouts that is chock full of fun. They have coffee, they have ice cream, they have pastries, they have tea...I mean, comon' they even have cheesecake. The staff have always been really friendly and eager to please. Hubs and I have strolled in here a few times during Friday gallery crawls and have yet to be disappointed. 

I've enjoyed a very good, and very sweet, white mocha. No doubt it would put most folks straight into sugar shock. On another occasion I've taken down a hefty strawberry croissant. While it wasn't at the caliber of other local bakeries, it was still flaky and scrumptious. I also remember a time that I enjoyed some type of mango iced tea. Even unsweetened it was the perfect accompaniment to a sweltering summer day. 

Until next time, Smelly Cat, I'm going to try to get this song out of my head now."}
{"text":"Their shakes are insanely good, maybe even better than their coffee, which is superb as well."}
{"text":"Man, I miss living in NoDa. Count this place as one of the 59384759 reasons why.

I use to live a few blocks away on Yadkin, so Smelly Cat became one of my second homes. You may have seen me riding around there as a passenger in Gman's golf cart. We are former roomies. Hi Greg.

Coffee, hot chocolate, tea... hot, cold. Whatevs. It's all fantastic. I was excited to have a meeting with Nathan B. over there today and reunite with my coffee shop. We were successfully productive despite a whole lot of eye candy visiting Smelly Cat this morning. Meow. See what I did there.

In a hurry? Grab a cup to go. Looking for a place to post up and get some work done? Make yourself at home and fire up the laptop. Make sure to snag a baked good, too. 

The workers at Smelly Cat are super friendly. They pretty much know everyone (if not actually everyone) in the 'hood. Plenty of parking in the SC lot and also on the street. Easily accessible. 

If you're in or nearby NoDa, be sure to stop by and get your caffeine fix here."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing drinks. Highly recommend it. Loved the drinks and games and it was a great place to hang out"}
{"text":"Great service and great advice on different types of cold brew. Great a selection of coffee and cold brews."}
{"text":"4.5 stars
What kind of coffee place doesn't recycle? Is this a new thing?

Recycling aside,  Smelly Cat was the perfect place for some caffeine fortification before the return leg of a road trip. Ended up with a frappe with an extra shot of espresso, and it was lovely and tasty. The dirty chai gets a lot of press, but I love my classics. Parking is free for two hours (put your receipt on the dash!)

I assume that this is named for Smelly Cat of Phoebe of Friends fame (maybe they should have Friends reruns playing? too blatant?), and it's a lovely little coffee shop with plenty of comfy seating and knick knacks and decor that you'd expect from a local little hipster-ish coffee shop. This is totally the kind of coffee shop I would hang out in to catch up with an old friend, or to solo write or read. Busy, cosy, but not too crazy.

Side note: They ran out of whipped cream while fixing my friend Kristen B's frappe and I was as put out as a five year old who doesn't get rainbow sprinkles on her sundae. However, they said I could come back for it in a few, and they totally did when I came back for it later!"}
{"text":"Best dirty chai ever.  Excellent staff and a delicious beverages.  Just an overall enjoyable coffee experience."}
{"text":"Definitely in love with Smelly Cat, I work down the street so I come up here quite often. They are friendly and fast. Great customer service. Their coffee is great, it's fresh and smooth, perfect roast. Their lattes are delicious and creamy even with non-dairy. I love that their iced beverages are made with crushed ice. I also get their teas, smoothies and snacks and have always been satisfied."}
{"text":"This local coffee shop is the typical indie joint to grab a brew (coffee or beer). Every town has to have one, and Smelly Cat fits right into the Charlotte artsy district.

There is a lot of unique decor, it is located in a cool hipster district, and well... it is just totally what you expect! There are fresh baked goods offered, and alcohol, and lots of coffee choices. Also, there is ample comfortable seating and free wi-fi.

My decaf was pretty good, though slightly less hot than I would like. Regardless, the atmosphere is half of what makes a coffee shop great.

SC is friendly, and it is a solid place to sit down and enjoy your morning or afternoon with something to drink or eat. This joint really has the typical cool coffee shop thing down. Check it out if you want a hip, trendy place to bring your friends."}
{"text":"What a fun enjoyable place to come to.  I came here one morning grabbed a coffee (which was delish) and muffin and sat outside (there is some great people watching which is an added bonus)."}
{"text":"This is, so far, my favorite coffee shop in town. Comfy, good coffee, great prices and nice staff. I also like it that they work with Yelp because when I checked in I got a nice surprising discount just for checking in. I will be returning often and will also try catch some of the events they offer. The tomato soup is delicious! Too bad that there is not much seating inside, but it is not something to complain about as it provides an intimate atmosphere at the same time. Love it!!"}
{"text":"The coffee shop is the only shop in town that offers their own roasting on premises. They have a giant contraption that they roast the green beans into what you're used to putting in your coffee grinder. 
The coffee was delicious, a citrus raspberry taste with a light roast. 
They also offered plenty of samples of their baked goods, which tasted amazing. I was happy to see that they offer real milk and cream, instead of the non-dairy creamer stuff. 
There were plenty of places to sit and relax, play one of their games, or read one of their books. They offered lots of free literature at the front and back of the bar. 
The staff was very welcoming and friendly, and the prices were quite reasonable for the high quality of coffees they're serving."}
{"text":"Only $3 for a 12 oz Chai Tea Latte? Yes please. Absolutely fantastic. It's not hard to beat Starbucks' version, but they knocked it out of the park.

Comfortable, unique atmosphere; friendly, smiling faces; beautiful outdoor patio space."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat was recommended by a friend, so my Wife and I are gave them a visit while we were in NODA. We like the fru-fru coffee drinks and usually go to Starbucks. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I had a almond milk mocha w/toasted coconut and it was probably the best cup of coffee I have had in quite a while. It was also a little cheaper than Starbucks. I will definately be visiting more often. Fresh Roasted Beans, a Nice Staff, and a Fair Price. I would definitely recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Staple coffee place for NoDa. They have some of the best coffee (and really good apple cider) in Charlotte. The staff here is always really friendly and helpful.

Inside the coffee show is pretty cozy. They have a few tables, some nooks if you want to be secluded or some comfy chairs. There's not a lot of seating inside, but there's more on the outside. 

Great place to grab a coffee and get some work done (free wifi of course) !"}
{"text":"Great place to chill on the patio. Good location makes it easy for a casual morning walk to enjoy coffee."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. Never been disappointed except with parking options.  Coffee is delicious and the atmosphere is inviting."}
{"text":"Five stars for quality of coffee and service! Awesome coffee shop with high quality stuff and good prices"}
{"text":"First time here. It was decent coffee but there's better in Charlotte. The breakfast biscuit burrito was good. A little overpriced imo but overall pretty good. Staff was extremely friendly so that's a huge plus. It's in a great location as well!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is so cute. I don't live in Charlotte anymore, but it's one of my favorite spots for whenever I'm back in town. Frozen dirty chai is amazing!"}
{"text":"How can you not love a coffee shop named as a direct homage to the show Friends? Well, whatever they are feeding Smelly Cat, it must be fantastic! See what I did there?

Smelly Cat is well-placed in NoDa, and a perfect pit stop on the way to NoDa Eclectic Marketplace on Saturdays.Smelly Cat is pretty small inside, so getting a table can certainly be challenging and encountering a line is not an uncommon experience. But, that dirty chai though is well-worth the hassles."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Charlotte!  This little gem is in the heart of NoDa.  The coffee is amazing, the owners keep it upbeat and fun. 

There is a great selection of breakfast sandwiches that are fresh made in the back, and delicious fresh muffins. 

There is free wifi, you just have to request the password of the week. 

It's a great place to do some work during the week, meet friends, or just relax on a Sunday."}
{"text":"In town visiting and found this cute local place. Hands down very iced coffee I've ever had. Strongly recommend the Vietnemese Blend. And wow was it strong. Don't drink on an empty stomach! Employees were super nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"My go-to place for my morning pick me up when I work in the neighborhood. Coffee is always fresh, they have almond milk (which is a big plus from someone who doesn't drink soy) and the staff is always super friendly and welcoming. The bagels and their herb cream cheese are made in house and are to die for. If you're in the area, definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"Best coffee is found in hipster coffeeshops and this is a great hipster coffeeshop!

They have free wifi which makes it great to study/get some work done. They have both indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. It's warm and cozy ad the perfect place for a nice warm drink and relaxation. Love the chai latte. Prices are good, friendly service. I will be back."}
{"text":"We were in town to see if we want to move to Charlotte. We visited a few coffee places and I was afraid I wouldn't find one that fit. I was wrong . This place is awesome from service to the quality of the teas and espresso. The baristas were so nice when we had questions about where to go and what to do in the city. Just a fantastic find!"}
{"text":"Love it here! We stumbled upon the place a few years ago while our friends were showing us around Noda and last month we were delighted to revisit. The coffee is gourmet deliciousness, the staff is knowledgeable and the decor is kitschy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome staff!!!!! We were traveling through. They gave me tasting of a few coffee types since I usually only drink tea but when in Rome. I found a delicious one! They make all breakfast items in house. We had quiche and egg/cheese burrito yummy. We also got coffee cake muffins and water for the road. The atmosphere is eclectic and groovy. A must see. If your traveling through make the effort to hop off I-85 and enjoy it. You will not be disappointed. They have outside seating also. A small parking area on each side of building and street parking. Did I say awesome staff oh yeah but I'm sayin it again! Great job guys. GROOT loves you!"}
{"text":"Awesome little coffee shop with beautiful design. The mural in the bathroom is beautiful!

I had a dirty chai frappe... Delish!!!!  Can't wait to try it again, next trip to Charlotte!

Best name for a coffee shop too, totally reminded me of a much cooler Friends Central Perk :)"}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop with tasty beverages.  I'm no coffee connoisseur, but the coffee here is quite good.  I've been heading there to get a little work done on Sundays around midday, and there's a nice diverse crowd of people chatting, working, and grabbing to go drinks or food.  Cyclists stop by during the morning ride, and people walk their dogs up for a little morning caffeine. The atmosphere is very hipster and cool, but not oppressively so. Sunday mornings (I don't know what other days) they have hot breakfast items- biscuits, burritos and the like which are pretty good.  There is also a case of baked goods, but I haven't sampled those yet.  Overall, I will be returning for more coffee and chill time."}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker but I ended up here on a food tour. It's such a cute place. The decor is nice and there's actually plenty of small tables for lingering despite the small space. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable about the products and the beans are all roasted in house. While others in my food tour tried the Colombian coffee, I tried mango iced tea. They also had really delicious no bake treats! Stop in!"}
{"text":"Am usually not a coffee person... but yest we had some time to while awa and tot vll check out this coffee shop...though the name doesn appeal at all, i must say for a change i enjoyed drinking coffee..ordered a cappuccino without any added flavor...it smelled good..and tasted nice!!
also picked up their house made muffins...a craneberry orange muffin..it was delicious...actually pieces of fruit to bite on...i loved it. the ambience is also nice for some one to just sit and read or listen to some music while enjoying a good cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop.  Service was quick and friendly.  Coffee was great.  The space is a little tight and we ended up sitting outside.  Highly recommend and we'll visit again."}
{"text":"I normally stick to Starbucks but this place was a good change for fresh brewed Coffee and great snacks."}
{"text":"So I've probably passed this place a thousand times since moving to Charlotte and finally stopped to see what the good ole smelly cat hype was about. It's a little vibrant coffee shop located in the Noda area. I'm a huge iced coffee fan but I thought ahhhh what the heck I'll step out of the box today. I tried a iced vanilla latte with almond milk and it was okay. You have to have an acquired taste to drink them but they were really good but much different taste from a iced coffee to clarify. The young lady behind the counter was super nice and helpful. Even let me sample a few things! Loved there outdoor seating and the fact that it has shade so I can still sit outside and enjoy a nice book even in June 90 degree weather. I'd definitely say try it out they offer more than just lattes!"}
{"text":"Came looking for a good local coffee shop and this place delivered. The place is kinda small so come at a good time and you'll get a seat--but I have no complains about the quality of the coffee. The atmosphere is very relaxing and NoDa (the area it's located in) is a nice spot as well! A good central location and now my local favorite."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop. Not much seating inside but more seating outside if the weather is nice enough. Yummy iced chai latte."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this little coffee shop. After drinking their vanilla lattes I would pick this over Starbucks anyday! All if the staff are such sweethearts and super quirky and fun, it is in such a good location in NoDa. It's one of my favorite places to go just to type up a paper and have a coffee or chi tea."}
{"text":"Quaint and cozy coffee shop with friendly staff. Coffee was tasted great and they had a small selection of pastries/muffins. Great outdoor space too. This place has a great vibe about it."}
{"text":"As a FRIENDS fanatic how could I not like a place called \"Smelly Cat\"?  (does literally everyone write that in their opening line *rolling eyes at self*)...hee hee hee :)

A cute little place. Repeat TINY. Would love this place as a solo-venture or even with the hubby but with kids in tow...nada in NODA. The black drip coffee was decent. I opted for the black dark organic roast. Thumbs up. Took a sip of husband's medium roast and it was crazy bitter. However he says he enjoyed it so there you go. ;) As far as gluten free they had a delightful peanut butter bar; stole a few bites from the kids and it was sugary delightfulness. Very rich. Anywho. Super cute place. Enjoyed seeing NODA and cannot wait to get back to the neighborhood to try out some of the food and culture fare."}
{"text":"Okay yes they didn't have a burrito for breakfast but at least the biscuits were really good! The place is tiny but great and the coffee very unique and nothing like Starbucks. 

Worth the trip to see the artwork and catch the great vibes of NODA . I can see why this place is a local favorite. Plus who can't stop thinking about Friends when they hear this name! I like it because it is an experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago in Charlotte area for an internship. I google 'best hot chocolate in Charlotte' and Smelly Cat pops up. I gotta say they were right. It is the best hot chocolate I've ever had and I came back to try the Chai cause they told me it was good. And it was just as good as the hot chocolate. Before I go back home, I'll be stopping in for some hot chocolate and some chai to take home with me."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee shop. Went there to start our date night. We got a Sweet New Orleans cold brew and my bride got the spiced brown sugar latte. We also got a slice of the zucchini bread and a morning glory muffin. Super tasty. We will be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was tasty and fresh! Coffee was a bit sour for my taste. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great locally roasted coffee.   Convenient to UNC Charlotte.  Friendly, coffee savvy staff."}
{"text":"I am still not sure if this coffee shop is an ode to Phoebe from Friends or not- but I can't help but sing her song in my head every time I walk through the door. 
Their staff are always so friendly, like family, really. From bold roasts to teas, it's all top notch. 
Post up in one of their booth nooks, perfect for the remote worker; grab a seat in the red chairs out front and enjoy some sunshine, or snatch a table table at the bar and spectate the people walking by."}
{"text":"We went here after KIDaween at The Neighborhood Theater this past weekend and I've been here once before several months ago. It's a pretty cool place with a lot of personality. The coffee is good, I just had a regular, dark roast coffee and Becky had tea. KIDaween gave each one of The Little Kids a coupon for free ice cream which we redeemed.

The staff was awesome, friendly and professional. The girls at the counter were very nice to the kids and asked about KIDaween.

The set up is quaint and artsy as it should be in NoDa and there's a nice balance of NoDa natives and families filling the tables.

Love the community board (but I have a weird thing for those) and the little outside area.

Definitely will stop by again."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this coffee shop from the name itself, reminded me of how much I miss the TV show Friends. 

I tried the Sledgehammer ($3.75)- espresso with Giradelli dark chocolate, it was pure happiness. Totally recommend if you like bitter coffee and dark chocolate. It's a little 4oz shot but I wish they served it in a big cup. The other coffee options looked great and interesting as well. They also have a few beers available in bottles.

It's a great place for a coffee date, chilling with friends and to study (FREE wifi, yay). It has both outdoor as well as indoor seating available. If I lived around, you would definitely see me here every week.

The servers are really friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"They have good coffee that is undoubtable, but the interior is not set up for an ergonomic study area. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, the place is too dark (think throwback to 2000's Abercrombie dark), and the music is unbearably loud. Stopped in after hearing so many good things from people, but definitely not a convert. Might be great to grab a cup of Coffee and talk with a friend, but go elsewhere if you are trying to get work done."}
{"text":"Love the chunky monkey, a frappe with a banana and chocolate blended in. So yummy!

The atmosphere is a true \"coffee house\" with great tunes and workstations with privacy and outlets. 

A great noda treasure!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their amazing iced chai Latte and dirty chai Latte! hopefully one of these days, I'll get to try something else off of their amazingly extensive menu. They're probably the only place (or may be one of very few coffee shops in town) that serves cortados! and if you're not in the mood for caffeine, you can have beer, wine or ice cream instead. I wish they had better food options; it would be nice to have a fresh croissant with the coffee :) 
the staff is wonderful and friendly. I've found that the ambiance in there is a reflection of the staff's mood.. late on a Saturday morning, it can get loud with chatter and music, and then there are times when it's quiet enough to get some reading done. They're a bit pricey to be my every morning coffee stop, but not at all a bad option for my weekend coffee fix.. 
you can pay by cash, card or Square (pretty hip huh ;) )"}
{"text":"I love this little place with all my soul. Super cute. Super quaint. Personalized and hipster fresh. Ordered the toasted coconut latte. Yum! House made syrups! Yum! Place is kinda small and it's a little cold to utilize the outdoor seating but I could totally see myself coming to this place everything to retreat. I'm not from charlotte but of the 4 shops I've tried while I've been visiting, this by far is my fav. If you love super unique places. Try it!"}
{"text":"Smelly Cat C/H is in NoDa...and as the NoDa quest it is neighborly, and with an artsy flair. It is VERY tiny, and dark indoors, and there are a few tables & chairs outside. The 2 baristas, one male/one female, were both attentive, friendly & helpful in my choosing what to drink...it was my 1st visit there. The price of coffee was shockingly REASONALBE...YES! Smelly Cat was extremely CLEAN and tidy...something that is important to me. If I lived IN NoDa, I bet I'd become a 'regular' at The Cat. It's a good place to know about in that part of town to meet friends and clients, too. I only saw cookies/pastries to eat, but I was there in the evening and was more concerned with cleanliness than food choices (just being honest). I WILL return and use The Cat as a regular meeting place when in NoDa.
Only possible 'con' is IF you use artificial sweetener, BRING YOUR OWN, as smelly cats do NOT use artificials...sorry but I have lived well on 'PINK\" now 61 yrs and never treated even ONE patient in 38 yr of ER Medicine who was ill from using 'PINK'. I'll be stashing a few in my car starting now."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you?!  Ha!!  Aside from the Friends reference, I can offer a great review.  I thoroughly enjoy coming here for a tasty cup of brew.  I really think the vibe has changed since they took out their on-site roaster; bring it back.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a cool place. 

One of my favorite things about this place is that they make their own syrup flavorings.  I normally get vanilla syrup added to my coffee and it is phenomenal.  They have plenty of food options, but let me warn you.... I got a cheese biscuit and it was like eating rubber.  It was so bad I had to throw it out.  They should rethink their biscuit preparation.   

Service is always fun and friendly. Parking is horrible, and there are not enough seat for dining in.   They really have outgrown this location.   Go check them out, but be prepared to park and walk!!"}
{"text":"Great service from attentive baristas who have not learned to burn coffee like Starbucks, and also fail to give a convincing apathetic attitude to suggest they are only doing this until their art sells to a generous patron.  In fact, Smelly Cat has easy off street parking in a fashionable neighborhood, and is an enjoyable place with good bakery items.  They may learn to be disappointing someday, but for now they actually measure up.  Get there soon, or don't.  Then I will get more coffee."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee I've ever had. The best coffee place in Charlotte and the Carolinas. Great vibe. Cool looking."}
{"text":"Over all good. But deff not the best chai I've ever had..."}
{"text":"Smelly Cat is a cute little cafe right in the heart of NoDa. The cafe is right across the street from some bad a** new condos and apartments! You couldn't ask for a better location! 

Environment: I love the way that they use repurposed materials to decorate their space.  When repurposed materials are used for decorating, you really have to have an eye for what goes together well  and Smelly Cat did it well! You walk in and you see booths made out of reclaimed wood and old doors, exposed brick, and duct work. They have free Wi-Fi and outlets to plug in your laptop and phone. The place is cozy, functional, and visually interesting. There is also outdoor seating. They are coveted so good luck. We drank our coffee at the bar facing the window and scored outdoor seating as soon as some people left! 

Service: Very Friendly! The barista explained the different options including the many food options, various brews, and their homemade syrups. 

Coffee: Great! I followed the advice of some of my fellow Yelpers and ordered the dirty chai over ice. It was creamy, sweet, and delicious! 

There is a parking lot that isn't that far from the cafe. It was reasonable and a short walk. 

I enjoyed my visit to Smelly Cat!"}
{"text":"Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, 
What are they feeding you? 
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, 
It's not your fault 

Now, I am going to be 110% honest here, the reason my fiance and I ventured to Smelly Cat is because we just moved to the area and WE LOVE Friends. When we found out there was a coffee shop in town and that's down the road from us named Smelly Cat, it was a no-brainer. So, we jumped on our bikes and the story beings.

WOW! Everyone and their Mom comes here. We visited Smelly Cat on a Sunday and I was nervous with the Farmer's Market next door and a number of dogs that we wouldn't be able to find a place to sit, but we did! 

All of their breakfast items are homemade, so if you get there late don't be surprised if that breakfast burrito you wanted is no longer there. Yuuup, that's what happened to us. Our barista pointed us in the right direction and we settled for a breakfast sandy with sausage, egg and cheese. I am pretty sure the biscuit is what made this sandy from meh to yum! 

Iced coffee lovers, this is your spot. With four, maybe five, different types of cold brew on draft. I don't see the problem. I went with the New Orleans style cold brew and I should have asked for more information. This was far too sweet for my likening, but now you know."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee in Charlotte. It's usually easy to park, casual vibe. It's very hipstery, in a good way. They have a really pretty roaster, and I've seen them roasting their own coffee right on the premises. They have a baked goods, often began options, veggie chili, breakfast biscuits in the mornings. There is also a case that has a couple beer options. I can't think of anything else."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. They let me sample each cold brew and pick out the cold brew I enjoyed the most. The in-house one was up to par!"}
{"text":"We went in for the name and free wi-fi.  We stayed a while because of the awesome vibe.  Smelly Cat is in the fun NoDa neighborhood.  There were 80's tunes playing when we arrived, local art on the walls, and excellent re-purposing of old shabby chic doors to form - I don't know what to call them - maybe table cubicles?  The doors divide space between tables along the walls.  What a great way to create semi-privacy.  I've never seen that done before, so major snaps for creativity.

Loved the concrete coffee bar and exposed industrial ceiling.  Smelly Cat is ultra hip.  Oh, with good coffee, by the way."}
{"text":"I used to go in a lot with my friends last year, and always really enjoyed the shop! And now I hear, free wifi? Their drinks are awesome, their goodies are yummy, and some are gluten free! (Which means I can eat them! xD) They have really slushy ice, which is awesome because it is like snow, and I'm the weird kid who put out a bowl for snow to fall in every year so I could have 'natural' snow cones. The baristas are always friendly, and nice, even if you just want a cup of ice. I will definitely have to make my way over for some caffeine buzz, and free wifi to do my homework. Awesome shop with an even better atmosphere, definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee house!  I had espresso (latte) which was wonderful....not bitter at all!   I hate Starbucks and coming here and experiencing a real coffee shop where there is a quality product was awesome!   We need more of these places in Charlotte!   My hubby had Cafe au lait which he said was delicious and he's not even a huge coffee person.   The ambience of the place is great to hang out in and just chill or enjoy with friends!"}
{"text":"This is my new spot for Sunday afternoon coffee! A large cappuccino, a spot at the coffee bar and relaxing atmosphere is where it's at. On a hot summer day, I saw just about everyone ordering one of the many flavors of frapps. Can't wait to see what this place has in store for upcoming fall season...lets hope it'll put the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte to shame!"}
{"text":"Where NoDa wakes up. Excellent coffee. Nice outdoor seating. Wishing I'd come for cocktails last night."}
{"text":"Best coffee in NODA and in the top few in the city.  The shop is small and has a steampunk kind of vibe.  Nice outdoor seating on three sides of the building too.  Great coffee with a limited amount of pastries that are good if you want a bite to eat.  The farmers market takes place saturday mornings in their parking lot.  A coffee and some of the goods in the market make a wonderful start to the day.  The staff is really friendly and work quickly.

***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.  If you are going out in NODA I've got reviews up of all the places in the neighborhood if you're looking to compare.  ***"}
{"text":"Went here on a quick trip to Charlotte and loved it. The atmosphere is welcoming and there is ample indoor and outdoor seating. The baristas were kind and knowledgeable, and my latte was tasty! If you are looking for a unique local coffee shop in Charlotte, this is your place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops. Favorite drinks are dirty chai, caramel latte, and white mocha. Two problems: close very early Monday's and Tuesday's, and not nearly enough seating inside."}
{"text":"I will never forget you delicious iced chai! So good. 

It's a fun and quirky coffee shop, that has delicious chai, what more can you ask for? Maybe a dirty chai, with a shot of espresso?? And pumpkin rolls in June? I'm in! Although I wasn't as into the roll as much as the chai, it's still a solid shop in my book."}
{"text":"Slow but friendly service. Excellent chai latte. Relaxed and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just sitting here getting ready to leave. I came here to get out of the house to study -- however this is not the spot (well for me). Having a lot of technical terminology to learn - the distractions here were  worse than my dogs. 

But for a coffee shop to chill and surf the web --- this is a great place. The music selection overhead was perfect, the ambiance is cozy, the counter staff professional and with smiles. 

I ordered a non-fat cap and it was velvety, smooth, and delish. The beans they use are roasted to perfection. 

I will have to check out the Smelly Cat again when my brain is not required. 

Thanks for the Java Jolt Smelly Cat!"}
{"text":"The Smelly Cat was great. They have a very bright and fun decor; outside seating; and a big set of rocking chairs. How can you go wrong with rocking chairs? 

The barista made my hot chocolate with milk instead of water and put a nice serving of whipped cream on top. The young man who served us was extremely friendly, genuine, patient, and hard-working... and quite cute to boot. 

The cafe is in the NoDa neighborhood (North of Davidson), a two-block assemblage of eateries, alternative shops, a concert venue, etc. It seems to be the only area in Charlotte that doesn't suck. The only problem is that many of the places around are closed on Monday-Wednesday nights."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and we had two fantastic almond milk lattes. Breakfast burrito was also good. Most of all the place is just a great coffee house atmosphere - - comfortable inviting... Just an overall good vibe!"}
{"text":"One of my personal favorite coffee shops in Charlotte. Located in the heart of NoDa, parking can be a little tricky--but they do have a small lot next to the building.

It's a quirky joint in everything from it's name to its interior design, and it attracts all kinds of customers. I think we all have a universal appreciation for the \"Friends\" love. 

The coffee is great, they have multiple options to choose from and they have baked goods and breakfast options to enjoy with your drink! 

I recommend sticking to the basics: black coffee with a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit sandwich, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Very neat and unique coffee house with cute seating inside and out. They have a roaster inside, and have yummy baked goods. 

They also sell merchandise with their logo!"}
{"text":"Since they started roasting their own coffee, I take back my so-so review from before and give Smelly Cat a no-charity rating of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Chunky monkey! Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!
Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!Chunky monkey!

Holy sheet! Order this tasty thang called a chunky monkey! Wish I visited Charlotte more often....blows atl coffee away























Pst......did I mention  Chunky monkey!"}
{"text":"Great spot.My fav kind of coffee pub.went there this morning after show last night across the street at Neighborhood Theatre(another great venue!)
Friendly staff.Great espresso.Fair pastry,but I didn't go there for the pastry!
Next time I'm in Charlotte, I'll hit up the Cat!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best coffee shop in Charlotte. My personal favorite is their Vietnamese coffee (with a flavor shot), but everything I have ever had from there has been phenomenal. Their chai comes in at a VERY close second. Charming location. Great outdoor seating. They also offer a small menu of desserts, soups, etc. This place is a must stop every time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I love smelly cat coffee! This is one of my favorite coffee shops, for sure in Charlotte, but may be of all times. I love the nostalgic feel inside and the seating outside. The variety of drinks makes this hole in the wall a special place to visit.

Sometimes parking can be a problem on the weekends, but if you don't mind a stroll, you can easily find parking up and down the street.

If you come hungry, don't worry! Their breakfast burritos are cheap and fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great iced chai latte.  Love the atmosphere of this place... very cozy and personal.  The artwork on the walls and also all the fllyers of the \"what's happening\" in the NoDa scene are great conversation starters as well as just keeping up with the local art scene.

In my last visit I noticed chess boards and checkers on the shelf which you can play with... not plastic/cheapo sets, but sets with character... wood with metal pieces.  I bet there are more games, but I only saw these in passing.

Staff was super friendly and my latte was unique tasting (in a good way)."}
{"text":"Wandered into this shop after landing in Charlotte at 7am. It was the only place open as I wandered NoDa, but I'm so glad I found my way to Smelly Cat. The dirty chai is the best I've had. So good, I went back the next day for the same thing. Plenty of outdoor seating when the weather's nice. Make sure to stop by on Saturday for the NoDa Farmer's Market!"}
{"text":"The best Chai Tea Latte I've ever had! My friend and I came here maybe a month or two ago. It was my second time, her first time, so we asked for a good recommendation. The girl who helped us was very sweet and welcomed us, and mentioned that their Chai Tea Latte was pretty tasty. Chai Tea Latte's are one of my favourite drinks and so of course I wanted to give this one a try. My friend and I both ordered one, and when one of the staff members brought it to us at our table (which was also really nice!), we were both really impressed! We will definitely come back here. 
The atmosphere was very cozy and welcoming.
Board games are available for you to play with whoever you happen to be with!.
We brought our own deck of cards so we played that for a while and a group behind us was playing a Harry Potter board game! Felt like I was at a peaceful family get together. Haha! 
All in all a really great experience - I've recommended this to basically all of my friends. 
The location is wonderful as well! Easy to just step out and walk around NoDa area and explore a bit."}
{"text":"When you want to stick it to the man (Starbucks) this is definitely a great option. The staff is friendly and almost all of them live locally so they're enjoyable to chat with and simply be around.

They recently have begun roasting their own coffee beans which adds a freshness and death to the coffee like I have never experienced before. 

Don't forget that they also offer wine and beer as well as a discount for beer when you check in with yelp.

However, the selling point for me is definitely that they except Square... So load them up in your Square Wallet and put it on your tab so you can feel like you're already a regular your first time visiting."}
{"text":"The atmosphere that Smelly Cat provides is a great additional experience to exploring the NODA area in Charlotte. I've been living in Charlotte for a year and this was my first experience of coming here. The coffee taste great, it gets crowded but doesn't feel suffocating, and the staff are really good. A place that I would definitely recommend if you're in the area. Enjoy Smelly Cat!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for coffee on a Wednesday morning and loved it. Went back again today for another cold brewed, iced coffee. 

Great decor (very funky) and I love to sails they use to give shade on the front patio. I would have locked a little something to eat but the baked goods weren't that appealing. I did buy a couple bags of coffee for home though. 

If you're in NoDa and appreciate excellent coffee, stop by the Smelly Cat!"}
{"text":"Came in for open mic night.
Wasn't a great night.
But its a cute shop, and the coffee was real good.
The parking is a pain, but its like that no matter where you go around here."}
{"text":"Excellent prices and excellent coffee. Not as gourmet a cup as what the coffee scientists at Hex coffee near Dilworth deliver, but still damn good. Also, the place itself and the area is really cool so consider a walk around if you aren't from Charlotte like me!"}
