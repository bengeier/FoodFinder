{"text":"FABULOUS COOKIES!!!! Obsessed can't wait to go back!!!  The cookie was just right and the people were so nice!! I love this truck and I will be back every time it's close to me!!!"}
{"text":"This truck was at a neighborhood concert at Eastmark. My friend asked if I wanted one and she came back with a piece of heaven! It was the peanut butter one and wow! So amazing! Expensive cookie but it certainly was delicious."}
{"text":"The best concept ever!!! I love these folks. Each option is better than the last one. How could someone I never met know me better than myself? They make such creative dishes which complement all the other great food trucks around for an amazing dessert."}
{"text":"Great truck to work with! Yummy desserts. Great for private events, birthday parties, weddings and company parties"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time trying them in a year. Cold cookie each time and ran out of cookies, again. Haven't got it right. It could be good, but needs work and consistency."}
{"text":"Love it !!!! I had a tom boy . A super soft  warm peanutbutter cookie with a scoop of ice cream drizzled in carmel topping  AWESOME"}
{"text":"We love the Hot Cookie Truck! Elizabeth and Scarlett are super easy to work with, and we loved having them for our wedding this past weekend. The cookies with ice cream was DELICIOUS and they were prompt and friendly to our guests. We loved having something different than just a traditional cake at our wedding.  Thanks for such a great evening!"}
{"text":"We had the Hot Cookie Truck provide deserts for a family members wedding last night. Their on site staff were great and the cookies were awesome! They were great and easy to plan with and were always responsive to emails. I would recommend them over and over to anyone."}
{"text":"Saw some food trucks in the Petco parking lot on a Friday night and decided to check it out.  Turns out they are there every Friday. There was live music too.  Of all the trucks, the Hot Cookie Truck would win best design.  It was the only food truck with a long line.  I personally think that the amount of food you get isn't worth the price but guess that is to be expected.    Next time I go, I'll get a coffee drink from another truck."}
{"text":"Seriously best cookies ever!!!!! The management and workers are so great and the cookies are so yummy! My kids would go every night if they could! Definitely a must!!"}
