{"text":"The food is alright, but for the high prices that they charge, I think I can do better."}
{"text":"Hamachi was great, but the grilled octopus was quite bland and small for the price. Miso ramen ($10) was awful - the soup had no flavour at all.  Beef donburi ($10) was also terrible. The dinner entr√©es are basically expensive bento boxes - they come with miso, salad and ice cream. At least with Ginza you would get seaweed salad and some California rolls (or small salmon rolls) with the meal.  The prices they charge for dinner were pricey, which would be fine if they served good quality food. It's higher quality than Ginza was, but at double the prices Ginza charged.  The service was excellent though! Kudos to them for that."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming.  First time here.  Waitress was very unpersonable.   We ordered the oyaku don with chicken and beef as well as an avocado roll for our 5 yo.    The beef one used frozen slices meant for hotpot.  Chicken one had cartilage in it. Onions were precooked - only redeeming part of the dish.   Eggs were sloppily beaten as you could still see the whites in the omelet.   Will definitely not return in the future."}
{"text":"Great food. The fish is fresh and the service is excellent. Sometimes they have special seafood that you cannot find elsewhere. The price you pay is well worth it, especially the lunch menu. Previous Ginza restaurant doesnt compare. One of the best japanese restaurants in North York."}
{"text":"i think the owner was changed. very different from the description and the pictures. expected exceptional but below than avg"}
{"text":"Good high quality sushi, sashimi and cooked food. They also serve a range of alcoholi beverages that are rarer to find elsewhere. They sometimes do promotions where you spend $50 and you get a free small bottle of sake.  They are not all you can eat.  Good quality specialty fishes and lots of seasonal items. Beware, because you get what you paid for you may be walking out costing you $100 a person depending on what you eat.   I usually get a nice plate of good thick cut sashimi (not talking about just your salmon and tuna, Qin talking about Hamachi, Toro, sweet shrimp, uni, etc), another plate of specialty fish sashimi on its own where then they use the bones of that fish and makes you a fish soup, some cooked food. And that somehow costs me $100 every time I go but it's good stuff you can't find outside on the regular.   Pretty clean place, service is decent."}
{"text":"I've noticed over the years that this place has switched owners numerous of times but they keep their name the same. Kaga By Ginza is a great Japanese place to eat at.   Food: My party usually orders in different visits as listed: a la carte sashimi, different assorted handrolls, rolls, eel on rice, tempura dinner, black cod dinner, and salmon belly, Their salmon and yellowtail sashimi are really fresh and they cut it into big thick slices. Handrolls are decent since they give you a good ratio of fish to rice. The black cod dinner comes with two black cods and lots of vegetables which I like a lot. The salmon belly is really oily though. Overall, the majority of food options is good and delicious.   Service/Atmosphere: The service is on point and they usually have two people working on the floor. It's been renovated for a while and the seats are comfortable to sit for a long period of time. When there are big groups, this place can become quite noisy.   Sometimes cellular service is pretty weak when you sit at the back area but maybe that is my own cellular provider's problem. They also have free wifi to make up for the lack of cellular service.    Finally, make sure to call ahead and make a reservation to avoid sitting in the sushi bar area as they are pretty busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is a very small intimate restaurant. I have a feeling that most of its patrons are local residents as it's exterior is not flashy at all.  From what I can see, it can prob seat 40 ppl in full capacity (including the sushi bar)  The menu selection is the typical classical Japanese cuisine fare. What they shine on is the attention to detail and fresh ingredients.  If you are a regular here, the manager is very good at recommending dishes, and he will tell us when they just had new shipment of seafood and recommend that.  A lot of time we don't even order off the menu, but leave it up to the chef's discretion... as the manager is also a very good judge of how much food we actually need. (While most places want to sell you as many items as possible, he would actually tell you not to order too much food, and he is usually right lol)  I think this is a restaurant that takes pride in its quality. Case in point, we were given seaweed salad yesterday. When asked why he didn't give us the regular garden salad, the reply was that the leaves needs to be soaked for at least a day and washed and they weren't ready yet."}
{"text":"We went there the Friday of Valentines Day / Family day weekend. They had promotion for 20% off for Valentines Day if paying cash.  We ordered Dinner for 2 combo set and it was so much food that we had enough food to take home since we didn't eat it all. I would say it was so much food to feed 3 people...  The warm welcome from the staff was unusual for most places I have eaten at Japanese restaurants. I liked how they made it easy to make online reservations from the website. Also when I was paying the bill and departing the hostess/server had thanked me using my first name. Not to mention getting a special VIP 20% discount card to use next time for dinner.  I will be going back to this place for sure"}
{"text":"Fantastic Japanese food. Fresh sushi/sashimi. Generously sized rolls and portions. There's less expensive options elsewhere, but the quality is top notch. Small space; service can lag if busy."}
{"text":"Sashimi was fresh,not thick slices served at Japanese AYCE cheap quality. sometimes thicker doesn't always means you're paying what it is worth,it just means they're trying to get rid of the overdue fish. Don't worry about this place,the chefs completely know what they're doing..and with a touch of class! Only one negative issue I had: their \"potlights\" on the ceiling were so hot we also lost our appetite,we had to ask them to dim the lights a bit."}
{"text":"Sushi is simply bad. The seaweed on my Ikura was coming apart. The nigiri special had a few pieces of fish that was too big and some that were broken on top of the rice. But what really made us realize we would not come back was that the sushi rice was cold, hard and not seasoned well. The dynamite roll was good, avocado was good and the tempura was fresh. I would say it is 2 stars because of the quality to price ratio. All you can eat quality... :("}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food and casual atmosphere.  You can order fancy omakase or a la carte from the menu.  I love getting the entire fish cut up and serve as sashimi.  They even make a free fish soup for you after.  Just ask the chef about what's fresh.  The bbq squid is amazing and the best dish is the clams in sake broth.  They have a good sake list also.  Must try if you are uptown as the price is decent with good food selection."}
{"text":"Kaga has been our go to sushi place after the renovation.  In easily two dozen trips the quality has always been above average for the neighborhood.   It's a bit pricey relative to your ichiban's, but the menu has anything you're looking for and the food has always been tasty.  Absolutely would recommend this place. Staff has been warm and friendly, and the sushi chef is a really nice guy."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service  So I've been to Ginza a couple of times when I had to use the services beside this restaurant (acupuncture facility). This past weekend was the first time I went to the renovated Kaga. I wasn't expecting much; after all it is a Chinese run Japanese restaurant.  They have lunch specials here, however you won't see it in the website. It is a completely separate piece of paper on the menu, and can also be seen in the front door. I had the sushi set, since I saw some photos here thinking there would be diversity in the fish selection. My grandma ordered the veggie and mushroom soba.  The miso soup and salad that came with our meals tasted okay, though the enoki mushrooms were not of high quality. Meh, I kinda expected it.  The sushi pieces were salmon, tuna, shrimp, surf clam, crab, and abalone...so I guess they change every so often. Also included were 6 small pieces of salmon makis. The presentation was poor, particularly the salmon makis that were clumsily done. The food itself tasted decent, with the exception of the abalone that tasted like plastic. The salmon makis were okay aside from the fact the salmon was very thin. As for the veggie and mushroom soba, my grandma seemed to really enjoy it. I never had a sip so I guess I'll take her word for it.  We also ordered the two piece chicken skin robata-yaki, which was quite a mistake. It didn't taste like anything at all really. Save the $4 please.  I'll probably still end up dining here if someone in my family using the acupuncture facility beside this restaurant. Too lazy to drive anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food is good, you'll tell that the cook has put effort in their food. Service is not bad either. Not very big place so fairly quiet."}
{"text":"Kaga is definitely a step up from Ginza. Still run by the same people but with an upgraded menu.  Here you will find fish flew directly from Japan arriving every Tuesdays and Thursdays if you want to have whole fish fresh sashimi.  Menu is covered  most of what you expect from a more traditional Japanese restaurant. They also has Omakase starting from $50.  Lunch Special starting from $8.  Sushi Set ($10) has a good selection of fish. Quite a good value. The only complaint maybe the rolls were rolled too loosely and falling apart when picked up by chopsticks.  Staff is friendly and attentive. My tea cup was not empty.  Grand Opening 10% off with coupon."}
{"text":"Higher end spot. Had the 9pc Sushi + \"Chef Rolls\" for $18. The sushi was a nice variety of fish. Quality and texture was really good. The chefs roll was just maki (avacado and cucumber) which was a bit disappointing. Who's the chef ? Tell him to throw some salmon in those rolls !!"}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly fresh and well prepared. We ordered a \"Big Eye\" fish (not sure the name). It was sliced into sashimi and the chef used the head and other parts of the fish to make a soup.  The wait staffs and chefs are Chinese, but they have been trained and worked in Japanese cuisine for a long time. This place is similar to the Japanese restaurants in Korean town with top notch ingredients.  One negative comment from me- this place is really noisy."}
