{"text":"I went tonight despite mixed feelings. The door was wide open, and there were already two couples there. (as usual, I go solo). The price was flashing 14.99 for AYCE, which seemed incredibly low considering I had wanted to go to a sushi place that was 23.99$ just moments before (only to discover that it was actually closed).  Keyaki is small, inviting, and has a very small selection, hence the price. Although my favourites weren't available (namely, yam, vancouver, and philadelphia rolls), they did have a small selection, including the Mont-Royal roll. Soups and salad are on the menu, and one soft drink is included in the price. I passed on the ice cream, but kind of regretted it later.  As seems to be common in Montreal, you basically check off what you want on an order sheet. I was able to do some homework in peace.  For the price, if I picked carefully what I order, I don't think it's to bad. I might try a few of the other menu items next time, as choice is limited and many of my favourites aren't available. No better time to try something new then when you have no choice, eh?"}
{"text":"The place is nice and inexpensive. However, the variety of sushi is quite poor in comparison with other all you can eat sushi restaurants. Most of the rolls are made with crab sticks and even salmon rolls hardly contain any salmon.  The all you can eat menu is also very confusing, I would even say misleading. We ordered 6 salmon and tuna nigiris along with some rolls and dumplings and we were only brought two pieces of each nigiri and most of the rolls were with crab sticks. I thought perhaps there was a mistake, however, the waitress informed us that the maximum portion of nigiris is 6 pieces per each order (regardless that there were two of us).   On our second order however, she brought way more than 6 pieces of nigiris, which got us both very confused. At that point, I must say I wanted to leave. Although, the server was nice, the communication and strange tricks with the menu left me disappointed.  Yes, it's a cute budget place, however, there are many other all you can eat restaurants that offer various choices, besides imitation crab rolls. I just got a very strange feeling like the restaurant is trying to push cheaper choices to clients in order to cut food cost."}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis plusieurs années, je crois qu'il a été fermé un moment, mais maintenant c'est ouvert et il y a un menu végane (différent de l'autre menu) j'ai beaucoup apprécié le fait qu'il y avait une grande variété végane et même des dumplings, yay! Bon service. On ne manquait jamais d'eau. Vraiment abordable! Pour 15$ j'avais un combo d'une dizaine de sushis et 4-5 dumplings!"}
