{"text":"I finally ordered a pizza and some side items from this place! It was delicious...great pizza (great cheese)....and love their ranch dressing. I wished the Irwin location had more of a seating area (like a restaurant/bar)...I think they would increase business that way! I would go their with family and friends if they did!"}
{"text":"Great food. Not just pizzas but pastas and hoagies. Really fresh salads and their wings are killer. Tried their new cinnamon rolls the other night. There isn't a bad thing I've had. They use FRESH product so don't expect straight from frozen times like other places. I'd give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place.  We've had only one problem with them and they happily fixed it.  The drivers are always friendly and professional.  Our standard order is always delicious.  The person who answers the phone may not sound very friendly but she means business and your order will be correct.  The pizza isn't greasy and the salads are never brown.  The wings dings are just delicious for breaded chicken.  Try this place you will not regret it."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS! I found hair in my food and was charged for something I didn't order! Never again"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I wish they were cheaper, but you get what you pay for. Their Hawaii pizza has the sweetest pineapples I've ever had! They have a incredibly long menu so you can definitely find what you want."}
{"text":"Out here on business and stressed over good dining options, but this restaurant saved the day.  I've ordered from them a few times and always great quality, fast delivery and delicious tasting food.  I'm Italian and these guys do it RIGHT!"}
{"text":"I so want to like this place. When they're on their game, this might be one of the best pizza delivery options I've ever had. Unfortunately, they seem to suffer from a tremendous lack of consistency.   Out of about 10 orders from here, at least 30% have been delivered wrong. About 60% of the time the food has been cold to the point it needed to be reheated. I've also had to call the store on two separate occasions to see if my order was ever coming (after 1.5 hours).   On a positive note, the online ordering system works well. Their signature pizza \"the Marsala\" can be really good if made right and delivered promptly.   Stay away from their wings though. Very small wing-like imitations of chicken (they must get Cornish game hen wings?). The sauces have no flavor either. Or, then again, maybe when I got them, they were having an off night... Hard to tell, but not worth rolling the dice on."}
{"text":"The white pizza is AMAZING. Also we got a veggie pizza one time, I don't usually go for a bunch of veggies on my pizza but I would definitely get this again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for the living dead weekend at Monroeville Mall and needed a nighttime pizza to round out the experience.  We picked these guys because they were one of the only menus the hotel had available and didn't feel like searching for another place.  We are VERY glad we called them because that pepperoni and sausage pizza was the BEST pizza we've ever had!!  And we've put down some pizzas!!  We practically had to arm wrestle over the last piece, but finally settled for splitting it.  The sauce was phenomenal!!  I wish there was a Pizza Marsala in Columbus!!"}
{"text":"I am from NY -Nj area. I was really was not expecting much from this Pizza place.  I was near and I was hungry.    What a pleasant surprise.  I had the Chicken Parm and IT WAS DELICIOUS!  Great home made sauce with a good amount of garlic.  The way Italian food should be!  Did I mention the garlic bread.  Diamond in the rough!!"}
{"text":"Great local pizza place in Monroeville.  We ordered the Ranchero Pizza and it was delicious.  This pizza is more New York style.  The large pizza is very large.  The pizza slice has a thin crust in the middle with a good thick crust at the end.  The sauce is great along with the cheese.  If I lived in the area I would order this pizza.  The only negative was the price.  The pie was over $21 which seems steep for a non-Gourmet pie.  I also asked for plates and they were out of plates which sucked for us since we were staying in a hotel.  Give it a try over the chains."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this place is still in business, I thought it was a front for drug activity going on in the area, but i guess not. I had their pizza once. The sauce was bland and the crust was too thin. I never had it again, but the prices at this joint are reasonable, if you like mediocre then this is spot for you...."}
{"text":"My first \"white\" pizza. Awesome! Very helpful staff that didn't get annoyed when i asked lots of questions about the menu (from out of state) Delivery man was very nice as well."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local pizza place.   They're fast and reasonably priced.   The delivery driver is friendly and prompt.   We've enjoyed each menu item that we've tried including the pizza, turkey hoagie, breadsticks, mozzarella sticks, and chicken fingers."}
{"text":"There are far better pizza restaurants in the area. This is usually a last resort for a lack luster dinner. Their pizza has little flavor and the dough is bland.  The crew that is usually working are very rude. I have had several times where personal calls are being taken while waiting to order.   If you do order from here, always add 10 minutes AT LEAST to the waiting time they tell you. I am usually told 25 minutes and regardless of the day of the week it's an average 35-40 minute wait.  Better try Napolis for a real pizza."}
{"text":"They have such great food here.I highly recommend this place.If your a fan of buffalo and ranch.I would give the ranchero buffalo pie a try you will not be disappointed.Its also very nice that you can just order online and check on the status of your order."}
{"text":"I love the Pizza Marsala in Greensburg, so I thought I would have the same experience with the Monroeville store in regards to delivery. Unfortunately, when I called to place the order, I specified that I needed my delivery at 11:30, due to lunch restrictions, I was ensured that this was not a problem. At 11:40 when we still hadn't received our pizza, I called back to the store and was told that it was on its way and would be just a few more minutes. At 11:50, I called again when there were still no signs of delivery and I was assured that it was on the way. I then google mapped the place from my location and discovered that it was only 0.8 miles from where we were. The pizza arrived at 11:56, and less than half of us got to enjoy the food before returning from our lunch break, which is sad because it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered from Pizza Marsala on a recommendation from the Double Tree hotel staff.  Delivery was satisfyingly quick, and the pizza was a good representation of your standard Italian/American medium crust, mozz cheese variety.  Considering other delivery options in the area, I'd definitely recommend this if you're on a pizza craving, but its far from the superior options available in the Pittsburgh metro area."}
{"text":"Wanted a great pizza for delivery while traveling and this place is excellent.  The delivery was within 20 minutes from my call to once I placed the order. Friendly greeting when I called and was told the delivery would be in 45 minutes.  20 minutes later it was delivered to my hotel by a friendly face.  The pizza was one of the best I have had in a long time.  Fresh dough and fresh ingredients. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Excellent experience this time around. Ordered pizza, cheese and broccoli bites, and breaded mushrooms. I also inquired about the free breadsticks advertised on heir menu, since I spent over $20- got those too. The man who took my phone order was extremely pleasant and repeated back my order exactly as I ordered. I asked him if the Broccoli bites have bacon bits in them since I thought that I remembered them having some last time and don't care for bacon bits. He told me there was no bacon in them but when I got them, he was wrong, which was the only reason I left off a star. I was told my food would arrive within 45 minutes and it was here within the half hour. As many times as I have ordered from here, I can honestly say I have never gotten food that fast. The delivery guy was friendly and efficient. Very satisfied and hope these experiences with PM continue since we love the food so much!"}
{"text":"Pizza and Wings. Get them here, you won't be disappointed.   The small vegetable pizza is LOADED with veggies. The veggies are fresh and perfectly roasted. Pair this with some jumbo wing pieces and you won't be able to roll off your sofa.  Whatever you order, you'll get the symbol of delicious food: a greasy brown bag. If food could make bedroom eyes, the grease spreading across a simple brown paper bag would be it.  Onto non-food stuff: The plaza is tight, but there is free parking AND a beer distributer next door to fuel your post-pizza bad decisions.  The service is why a star missing- I ordered online and as soon as I walked in, saw my order waiting for me. The man behind the counter ignored me, another man messing with the oven looked at me then looked at his coworker ignored me, then he also ignored me.  I smiled pleasantly and stared at at my food, debit card in hand. Finally, a woman came from the back, noticed the men ignoring me up front and came over to get my card.   No frills, no haste from the workers, but it matters not!  My order was ready, my order was correct, and my food was tasty."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, although the service I got from the ladies working the phone/register horrible both times I went in to pick up my food.  Will not be coming back for that reason."}
{"text":"One of my go-to pizza delivery joints in Monroeville. They tend to do a slightly better job than Pasquarelli's or Vocelli's, in my opinion. The pizza usually has a slightly more crispy crust, the veg toppings seem fresher.  I also like their hoagies. The gyros are ok.  Delivery is sometimes a little longer than Vocelli's (in Monroeville at least) but I'd rather order from here than the other delivery options."}
{"text":"The best in the Irwin/North Huntingdon area! Their app makes ordering a snap. The presentation of the pizzas are excellent. I never thought about presentation for pizza before, but they really go the extra mile. It looks picture perfect when it arrives! The sauce is excellent, just the right amount of oregano. I've never had a bad pie from them, and their specialty pizzas are also delicious.  The weekend delivery times are really s l o w, like anywhere, so be prepared. Highly recommended the Pizza Marsala! You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Well we I went on a trip to visit the Zombie Capital of the US, Monroeville Pa and decided to try this pizza place since it delivered to our hotel. We got a 14inch ultimate meat and a cheesy bread. The cheesy bread is very good and I am a cheesy bread Nazi! This place added cheese then added Parmesan cheese which is nice, most places will not do that. Then the pizza sauce is cold, the way it was meant to be for VERY hot bread!!  I usually hate meat pizzas, cause I am not a Bacon fan on pizza, But this place some how does it right. No topping is more over powering than another! How do they do it!!?? I think this is one of the best places I have had the pleasure of eating at! I think no matter what, You should at least try it.... it is worth that!!  :)"}
{"text":"We order from here about once a month. It's unpredictable. Sometimes the food is decent and sometimes it's terrible. This latest order fell into the second category. Ordered a chicken parm hoagie which was fine but the regular chicken hoagie was mostly bread and covered in red onions. Unfortunately, there's no option on the online ordering app to remove the onions. Also, it took over an hour to get our order of two hoagies. Might be time to look for another option for pizza."}
{"text":"Fantastic hoagies and pizza! And a huge variety from which to choose. Very fresh ingredients, and they load up on the toppings and meat. This is my favorite go to place in Monroeville when I need my pizza or hoagie fix."}
{"text":"I just ordered a white pizza and it is well done. Not as in good but it is a burnt pizza with cheese on it! You order one of Pizza Marsala's specialty pizzas and it is perfect (which I have done five times and all of them were fantastic), but you order something so simple and it is trash!!! You need higher standards and train your employees with high standards as well!!! So disappointed."}
{"text":"Great customer service, agreeable, and accommodating!!! Our pick-up order was ready on time - hot and fresh.  The pizza was tasty and satisfying!  Thank you Norwin Pizza Marsala!!"}
{"text":"Years ago this was our go to pizza/hoagie place.  Since moving to the Norwin towne square location the quality seems to have gone down.  The pizza has been mediocre at best the last several times we've ordered.  It's been over cooked and on the verge of being burnt.  There's also been an occasion that our entire order was lost."}
{"text":"Ok, I take back what I said about the Italian Hoagie.  Just ate one and it was pathetic.  Who puts Spring Mix lettuce on a hoagie?  Apparently Pizza Marsala.  A 3.00 sub you could buy at Walmart sold for 10.99.  Pizza is still solid though."}
{"text":"I've never been inside Pizza Marsala, only ordered to go or had food delivered. Pizza is fine, hoagies are fine, overall okay. But, with so many pizza places in Irwin, that's not quite enough. So, here's my most recent experience, which has completely turned me off from ordering here again: we ordered food for delivery about a week ago - one taco salad and one steak salad. Were told 45 mins to 1 hour, typical. Food arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes later...fries, steak, taco meat, and cheese - all cold. Not luke warm...cold. We ended up taking all of the non-veggie toppings off the salads and heating them in the microwave. Didn't help, both tasted horrible! Other bad points: 1) 'steak salad\" was steak-ums, not very appealing. 2) Taco salad: When I ordered, the guy on the phone asked what type of dressing I wanted. I asked if they had sour cream and salsa....nope. Well, that sucked. Anyway, the taco salad was so greasy, grease was the whole way to the bottom, under all of the lettuce. Again, with all of the other pizza choices in Irwin, Pizza Marsala just fell to the bottom of this girl's list."}
{"text":"The delivery was quick. We got the meat lovers pizza and hot wings and were very pleased with the purchase. I would definitely buy food from here again."}
{"text":"Based on online ordering and delivery.   Make sure that on a Friday you give yourself an hour an a half to get the pizza.   VERY SLOW DELIVERY Make sure that if you order online you call to confirm they got it. We did not get our order one night.   GAVE THEM 3 CHANCES AND NOW WE ARE DONE."}
{"text":"Best pizza iv had in a while. Buffalo Chiclen pizza was absolutely amazing! Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"WARNING - MAKE SURE YOU DONT HIT THE  NO CHEESE BUTTON WHEN ORDERING A REGULAR CHEESE PIZZA. I ordered a large cheese pizza online and was getting it delivered to my house. Online there is an extra cheese & no cheese option. I thought the no cheese option meant you want no extra cheese! TURNS OUT THAT MEANS NO CHEESE  at all on your pizza... I luckily had a little mozzarella in the fridge and put it in the oven ..  We also ordered a steak hogue which was actually delicious   The delivery time from my order confirmation email to the time it got to my house was like 45 mins  The taste is alright .. It's not the best I've ever had ... The crust is very plain tasting .. but that could be a factor that I had to rebake the pizza and add my own cheese"}
{"text":"This is a review on delivery pizza only, as this is our primary spot to call for pizza-needs-while-at-work.  1)  Their delivered pizza is fresh-tasting and hot.  And handled carefully. 2)  Their specialty pizzas are a cut above.  Scared to try a taco pizza?  Don't be afraid! Marsala's does them perfectly. 3)  Delivery is consistently quick.  You will never wonder when you'll get your order.  That's my two cents for my pizza delivery location of choice in Monroeville."}
{"text":"Ordered 1 calzone and they said it would be ready in 20 min. After 40 minutes we received a cold calzone. While I was eating, I cut it open and found a black curly hair."}
{"text":"Ordered: Steak Hoagie and plain cheese  Both were very juicy and packed with flavor definitely stop by or order spot!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a LOT, and when I first started, I would have given them a 4. Their pizza is very good and always a crowd pleaser. But I'm scared to order anything else off the menu after getting mushy eggplant parm and wilted salad lettuce. I'll keep ordering for convenience but stick to pizza. Their gyro pizza is a fav."}
{"text":"I really debated on 2 or 3 stars.  Pizza was decent but had close to no sauce.  Their \"Hot Pepper Bites\" are breaded pepper jack cheese cubes.  Albeit, they were good but only when they were hot.  Jalapeño poppers were a bit too mushy and didn't taste very fresh.  I know what you're thinking; \"boy, that's a lot of different things.\"  Back off!  I had per diem left and needed to use it!  I would maybe give them another chance but I would have t exhaust a few other options first."}
{"text":"UPDATE: The food is still very good, this is clarification to a point I made in my previous review about chicken parm, with an addition for a new item I tried recently. After speaking with the manager (very friendly and helpful), the chicken in the chicken parm is cut up to make it easier for the customer. I ordered a chicken fillet sub yesterday, which also arrived as pieces of chicken instead of a fillet. When I discussed that with the manager, she said that customers may request the fillet not be cut up. For those like me who want to sink their teeth into meat hunks instead of little pieces, having that option is definitely a plus. So, summary: Unlike many other places, I can taste the freshness of the ingredients. The owner and staff are friendly and helpful, and the customer service is great. I have yet to try every item on the menu, but I'm well on my way. Hmm.THAT's my excuse! I'm not ordering from them so much because I'm too lazy to cook, I'm just doing research on the menu! Everyone join me in conducting your own research, ordering alphabetically, sequentially, or at random! We're not lazy, we're SCIENTISTS!!"}
