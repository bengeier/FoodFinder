{"text":"I haven't been here in quite some time. This place is now under new management since about a month ago, and there's some redecorating that's been done. There are new booths installed, and there's more room for to-go customers to order. The drink cooler is now located behind the counter. Now that the public is not touching it, you'd think it would be clean, but the front glass was really dirty, and obviously hasn't been cleaned in awhile. You also can't see what's actually in there from where you order, but that won't stop the order taker from barking \"which type of iced tea?\" at you.

The service this morning was glacially slow, and disorganized, just like I remember it. You'd think that new management may have sped things up, but maybe it's not management that's the problem.

After ordering a breakfast club, and paying $1.50 for extra bacon, and waiting, and waiting, I eventually received a regular breakfast club. I specifically asked if this had extra bacon, and unsurprisingly they also failed the integrity test.

The food here is simple with middle of the road prices, but slow service, unfriendly cashier, lack of integrity among the staff, and I see absolutely no reason to come back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in to grab a quick lunch.  The food is simple but very fresh, unlike a lot of places downtown.  Their daily specials are delicious, as well as the rest of their menu.  It's also a great price, I can usually get a sandwich or wrap for about $5."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 5 years now. The service is fast and friendly. The food is good and they can almost make you whatever you want. I love how the specials change daily but I always look forward to their meatball sub. Turkey club and BLT sandwiches are always good go-to sandwiches. It's cash only so make sure you have enough on you for your meal. I usually spend around $6 for a sandwich, side, and drink."}
{"text":"This was my go-to place for breakfast while I stayed at a nearby hotel for a workshop at the Supercomputer Center.   I had a breakfast club and coffee.  Quite good, and less than $5.  Amazing!  They are open early enough to take a bus to 8 am meetings in Oakland."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and I think they are the best value in the city for lunch.  I got a tuna salad sandwich for only $3.55.  They have breakfast available all day.  The service is extremely fast  - so much so that they get testy if you're not ready to order when you get to the front of the line.  They only take cash, so be ready for that too."}
{"text":"Whenever I head downtown on a weekday, Keystone Cafe is always on my mind.  It's one of those places I've returned to a few times and yet still haven't written a review.  So I'll try to make up for it now with a 5 star review.  

One day a few years ago I was downtown buying tickets for an upcoming show and wanted to stop somewhere for lunch.  I think I may have actually been walking to another lunch spot when I walked by Keystone Cafe.  I had never heard of it but decided to at least walk in and see what they offered.  They had reasonably priced food, the staff was friendly and the whole operation was very unassuming.  Who would have guessed this place puts together some of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted?  I've had a few but the turkey sub remains my favorite.  (While they do serve breakfast sandwiches as well, I have not tried any myself.)  Some people might call it simple, but sometimes a sandwich shouldn't be complicated.

Cut to a jury summons forcing me downtown.  Blah.  I had worked all night and just did not have the patience for jury duty.  I reluctantly made my way downtown via Port Authority to do my civic duty.  I may have taken several selfies along the way to entertain myself.  And the light at the end of the tunnel was the sandwich I was going to reward myself with from Keystone Cafe when it was all over.  When we were finally released around lunch time, I collected my $11.72.  As fate would have it, this was just enough to cover my bus fare and a turkey sub at Keystone.  A perfect way to end a less than perfect day."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots downtown. Quick, delicious and very reasonably priced! The owner is always there and is super sweet, along with all of the other staff members. You can get hot or cold sandwiches, soups, salads and a variety of other items. They are open for breakfast and also have a few daily specials. Definitely some of the best prices downtown. FYI cash only though!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers, this place is a great value.. especially when you've forgotten your lunch or didn't have time to make one in the morning.

 I've had the light lunch option (1/2 sandwhich w. soup or salad), the grilled cheese (you can choose your bread on your sandwiches) and the chef salad- I've had no complaints. 

The pasta salad & linquini could use more dressing but main menu items are A-ok. (just my personal opinion!) 

My favorite thing of all is the Ham BBQ Sandwiches. It takes me back to being a care-free kid in elementary school.

 They also have jello-pretzel salad often. 

Cash Only ***

{"text":"I really like this place and I'm happy that it's conveniently located in the same building that I work in.  I've gotten breakfast here a number of times and will continue to do so. It's fast, friendly and inexpensive. I concur with what others have already written and I've got very little more to add. My only comment (and I know I'm nit-picking here) is that I would rather wait an extra 5 minutes and have real eggs really cooked rather than be served the microwaved mixture they use that's out of a carton... All in all, the Keystone Caf√© is a bright spot in the Burgh. Nothing really outstanding about it but  you really can't go wrong getting breakfast or lunch here."}
{"text":"I've only had their breakfast, but their breakfast sandwiches are quick and consistently good, and they have a large selection of breads that you can have your sandwich on (i've had texas toast, wheat and pretzel bread). 

Everyone who works there is so sweet. Prices are very reasonable. 

If you're looking for a quick sandwich, this is a good place to go. The only downside is that it's cash only, but that's ok."}
{"text":"Sadly it appears this has been sold and is no longer the place it was. Menu items are changing and the girl who took my order couldn't be bothered to stop texting, make eye contact, or speak without mumbling. Needless to say....no longer on my list."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast and lunch. They make the food fresh and quickly to order. The owner is very friendly and goes out of his way to make his customer's happy. Today, I accidentally left one of my sandwiches on their counter and when I called to make sure it was sill there, the owner didn't hesitate for a second, found out where I was and hand delivered the sandwich to me at my office!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to pick up a cheap lunch.  It's pretty much standard sandwiches, soups, and side dishes.  Nothing fancy.  Pretty much something you could have made in your own kitchen but didn't have time to.  Sandwich prices are reasonable, and they taste good too.  I normally get  an egg salad sandwich on wheat bread.  They also have a light lunch option which gets you 1/2 a sandwich and a cup of soup."}
