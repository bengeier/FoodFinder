{"text":"Went there for a business dinner with a group of ten. There were no problems with them accommodating our large group. Service was prompt, food was great, and the atmosphere was modern and upbeat."}
{"text":"Its not the best place I would say but for basic pasta and pizza I can deal. I like their salads & raviolli . Sometimes you crave that cheap tasty food."}
{"text":"I won't go in to too much detail. But basically the service was horrible. We went here for diner with a large group for a baptism. I asked for a coffee when we go in. The waiter basically asked me why I wanted a coffee now, before the meal. I responded because I was tired. He told me he's busy and he will see what he can do. He was an older man but his service throughout the night was just atrocious. He continued to argue every request and at some point wouldn't even come over to us. At the end of the diner my friend ask for two espressos. The waiter told him to finish one and he could get another. He then brought a cappuccino to my other friend, forgot he had brought him one, brought him another one, got upset that he already had one and then told him to drink the second one. Piss poor attitude really. The other two girls and guy were solid though. Unfortunately the calamari was chewy, ricotta stuffed crepe was salty, pasta was overcooked. The portebello mushrooms were nice. Can't really recommend the place even though it looks classy."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. Ordered pasta and the plate came half empty. I don't mind the price as long as I get a decent sized place. Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Used to be my favourite restaurant, but it's seriously gone downhill. The past 4 times I've been there, the service has been really slow and/or they brought the wrong food to us. I don't necessarily blame the staff, because they need to hire more people. They're all running around like chickens without heads. The owner used to come around and ask how things were, now I hardly see him as well. The food is definitely good, and maybe they're just banking on that people will choose taste over service, but it's starting to become a deal breaker now."}
{"text":"This place has become my basis for comparison for all other Italian restaurants. Fresh pasta, fresh sauces and the best meatballs in driving distance!

Before your food arrives you get this red pepper, tomato sauce and fresh bread. its soooo good. I'm not sure what it is but I have bought some to go, its sweet and savory and so good with the warm bread. this one thing is worth the trip to this place. 

I have read the other reviews and I am not sure where these people are coming from. I assure you, if you order any fresh pasta, with any sauce and get them to put a meatball on it!!, you wont leave, hungry or disappointed. Another one of my favorites is the seafood risotto, recommended by me for sure

The food here is fresh and fast and at a great price, my wife and I can eat for under $30, I am not sure what the other \"yelpers\" reviewed but it wasen't the Boccis I know.."}
{"text":"- Waiter was rude and passive-aggressive for no reason. Not customer friendly at all and barking things at people. 
- Food was mediocre. Cheap overall quality. Calamari slightly undercooked and paired with caesar dressing sauce, wasn't a fan of that sauce. Bread was good, and the pepper sauce had nice spice to it. Pasta was much too salty for my taste. Manicotti was an epic fail, too. Others at the table all agreed it tasted like processed cheese. Definitely the worst part of the meal.
Overall: The pizza smelt good. Most of the other waiters/waitresses seemed pretty friendly. Probably not that bad of a restaurant but my experience sucked."}
{"text":"Excellent service et très bonne nourriture pour ce repas du midi. Boulette de poulet dans une sauce tomate fort goûteuse avec piments, champignons et patates rôties. Très goûteux et raisonnable comme portion. Table d'hôte du midi soupe et dessert incluant le café très bon rapport qualité, prix."}
{"text":"I had a friend tell me how great this restaurant was. I now have a friend whose opinions I can no longer trust. 

It was okay. A little expensive for what it is. He kept telling me how amazing the subs were. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't worth the price. And it certainly wasn't worth the long drive in from the city."}
{"text":"I really like this place... I definitely wouldn't call it the bestest Italian place ever but it's nice and friendly, has a great variety of items on the menu, price to portion ratio is excellent and whatever you do order will be good. Some of what you order may even be considered fantastic! 

I've been here once a few years ago for some friends' birthdays and I've ordered from them delivery twice now. Never disappointed in the slightest, delivery time was surprisingly quick too (without lowering the quality of the food)! 

The chicken parmesan (trio) is a great deal: huge breaded chicken filet, fresh tasty tomato sauce with choice of spagetti or penne in choice of 3 sauces...plus a decent mixed green salad with a nice balsamic dressing ...plus a 6\" fresh ciabatta ...and a can of soda came to 16.10$ tax included and was more than enough for 2! Their chicken wings too btw are pretty damn good! The poutine is decent but I have a particular palate when it comes to poutine so by all means try for yourself 'cuz it wasn't bad. 

My only lament is not ordering desert!!"}
{"text":"Fairly standard Italian menu. Food was decent but overpriced for what you get. I know of dozens of Italian restaurants that have the same or better quality of food at half the price.

Wine list was nice too but very pricey. I didn't hate it, but it seemed like this strip mall restaurant is trying a little too hard to be upscale and comes off as a bit cheesy instead."}
{"text":"Back in the day this was a really good, inexpensive Italian family restaurant. Came here with my wife to grab a nice little lunch. We both ordered the Bocci Burger which many moons ago was an amazing veal sausage patty on their own homemade bread. This 2016 version was not. It was some sort of hamburger patty slapped on some bread, quite sloppy and for the love of life was extremely salty. Sad part is that we were so hungry and pressed for time that we ate it. No, not a fan of this version of the Bocci Burger. On top of paying 7$ for 2 small glass bottles of coke!

Service was nice. Waitress was friendly and efficient. Not her fault they over salted the plate.

I think if we do go back the next time, we will stick to the subs. Problem is, in Lasalle, you have much much much better choices (Manzo, Serano, Lasalle Drive in to name a few)

Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Restaurant italien parfait pour un repas sécuritaire avec un ami de longue date.
Stationnement devant le restaurant.
La nourriture est bonne et le service bien.
Je n'ai pas été surpris par le menu et aucun plat n'a retenu mon attention.
Pour ceux qui ne veulent pas être surpris ou bien déstabilisés"}
{"text":"We hosted a baby shower here, 
Our waiter was friendly and always available. 
The manager was very accommodating to all my silly demands, like can you take down your Christmas decorations because they are clashing with our baby decorations style demands. He did everything with a smile.

Food was good for a buffet style. 
The restaurant is nice
Sadly there's almost zero parking for a venue that host so many parties at once. 
They had a group of 50, a group of 25 and us a group of 45 with about 10 spots for parking... 
Thankfully there is a grocery store across the street but they sadly have so much construction on that street. 

If you're looking to host a big event this is a GREAR venue."}
{"text":"I had been before on a date and bumped into some old neighbors (one being Italian was a good sign). It's really a combination of a coffee bar, nice seating area with an atrium feel and a reception room attached to the right. I recalled the food being quite tasty even compared to Italian cuisine in Italy itself. I especially remember the marinara sauce standing out as being right on the mark. It had that little tartness that I love and is hard to find done right at restaurants (in my opinion). I don't remember the service being off the hook, but it was definitely not a negative. Since those meals went well, I figured why not try again, but now with a party of four. This time the service stood out, but not in the best way (we all agreed). I was surprised, as I began to recall the previous visit having been pretty good. Thankfully, two things happened. The first was that another server helped out on a few occasions. The second the marinara sauce was just as I remembered it. The stuffed bell pepper, mini bocconcini with cherry tomato salad and Italian sausage with Dijon mustard were also very tasty and fairly priced at $3.99. The fettuccini carbonara was quite rich and creamy (a good plate to share - as we did). The Baked Lasagna was satisfying (it's bathed in 'the' marinara sauce). Last but not least was the seafood linguini (with white sauce) at $16.99 - a value, filled with fresh right sized shrimp, bay type scallops and plenty of other goodies including chopped garlic. I stated out loud - I would be back just for that stunning dish. Wrapping up a lengthy yet fun late lunch we shared a piece of red velvet layer cake and an apple torte. They were both great with lattes and cappuccinos to wash them down. We all joked that we were still full hours and even a day later. I almost forgot despite all the carbs we ate - the warm crusty Italian loaf was worth the wait. I used it to sop up the sauce on every dish. Oh, yah baby 'the' sauce."}
{"text":"Un resto sans chichi, bonne bouffe sympathique mais rien extravagant. Bref bon resto de quartier. 7.5/10"}
